        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't collide if I move to a freeway at a turn when a car is at x=0, as long as I wasn't on it before or something? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to \\( y_{T+1} \\neq y_{T} \\) at turn \\( T \\), you will NOT be considered to be on \\( y_{T+1} \\) at turn \\( T \\), thus will NOT be collided by cars on \\( y_{T+1} \\) if \\( 0 \\in \\text{Span}(T) \\) but \\( 0 \\notin \\text{Span}(T+1) \\).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose an action that will move me to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So during turn T, I am on y_T, and I might collide with cars on y_T if 0 is in their span at turn T. Then, after moving, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and I might collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe key point is that when I change rows, I'm only on the new row starting from the next turn. So for collision, at each turn, I check the row I'm on at that turn and if 0 is in any car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, the car spans move over time. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left by s per turn, for right-moving, it shifts right by s per turn.\n\nThe initial state is at turn t_1 = 0, I think? The problem says \"current turn is {t_1}\", but in the task, it says \"Turn t_0 = 0\", and \"Current Turn: t_0 = 0\", so I think t_1 is 0 here. Let me check.\n\n\"Current Turn: t_0 = 0\" and \"Player Position: (0,0)\", so turn index starts at 0.\n\nI need to find actions from turn 0 to some turn H-1, so that at turn H-1, y = 9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but since t_1=0, it's actions at turn 0,1,2,...,H-1, and position at turn H is (0,9), I think? Let's see.\n\nThe player position after action at turn t is for turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which I think means that at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = 9? No.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSince t_1 = 0, we need y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nSo after H-1 actions, at turn H-1, y = 9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to t=H-2? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nSince t_1=0, actions at time 0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAfter action at time H-1, we have position at time H.\n\nBut we need position at time t_1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = H - 1 since t_1=0.\n\nSo at turn H-1, y_{H-1} = 9.\n\ny_{H-1} is the position before action a_{H-1} is taken.\n\nLet's define carefully.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen I take action a_t, which causes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn 0, y_0 = 0.\n\nWe take actions a_0, a_1, ..., up to a_{H-1}, so that after H actions, we have y_H.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{H-1} = 9.\n\ny_{H-1} is the position at turn H-1.\n\nAfter taking action a_{H-1} at turn H-1, we get y_H.\n\nBut we need y_{H-1} = 9, meaning that at turn H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we don't care about what happens after, I think, as long as we reach it without collision.\n\nBut at turn H-1, when we are at y=9, we need to not collide with cars on y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, no cars, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nSo only rows 1 to 8 have cars.\n\nTherefore, when we are on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, when moving between rows, but the collision is only checked when we are on a row at a turn.\n\nSo for rows 1-8, we need to avoid being on them when a car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, back to the car states.\n\nI need to find a path from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum H is at least 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could be more.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at each turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=0.\n\nFor each freeway, we have cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span is [h, τ] with h and τ, and since it's moving left, if direction is left, h > τ? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\", and then shifts left.\n\nBut in the car state, for example, freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nh=48, τ=83, but if it's moving left, and span is [h, τ], with h=48, τ=83, but 48 < 83, so [48,83], which is from x=48 to x=83, but if moving left, it should be decreasing, so head is at the right, I think.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" with [τ, h] and shifts right.\n\nIn freeway 3, for example: (48, 37, right, 12), so for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [37,48] I think? But it says (48,37,right,12), and Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]?\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t_1, head at h, tail at τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for left-moving, d=left, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it shifts left.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, so Span(0) = [48,83], which is from 48 to 83, but since moving left, head should be the front, so if left-moving, head is at the left or right?\n\nTypically, for left-moving, head is left, but here [48,83] with 48<83, so if moving left, the head should be at 83, I think, but it says head at h=48, tail at τ=83.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates: lower x is left, higher x is right, I assume.\n\nSo for left-moving car, it moves to decreasing x, so the head should be at higher x at start.\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83, with h<τ, so if moving left, at time 0, head at 48? But if moving left, and span [48,83], that means the car is from x=48 to x=83, so left end at 48, right end at 83, but moving left, so the front is at left, so head at 48? But when it moves left, the position decreases, so at time 0, head at 48, tail at 83, but since moving left, tail is at higher x, so the car is oriented with tail at right.\n\nBut the span is [h, τ] = [48,83], so it occupies x from 48 to 83 inclusive, I assume.\n\nThen at time T, it shifts to [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T] for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: (48,37,right,12), and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [37,48], I think, but it says (48,37,right,12), and Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? But 37<48, so [37,48], and shifts right to [37 +12T, 48 +12T].\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be the front, so for right-moving, head at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nIn (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, so tail at 37, head at 48, so the car is from 37 to 48, moving right, so front at 48.\n\nSpan at T is [τ + sT, h + sT] = [37 +12T, 48 +12T].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, in freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83, so tail at 83, which is higher, so car from 48 to 83, moving left, front at 48? When moving left, front should be at lower x, but here head=48, tail=83, so if 48<83, head at left, tail at right, so when moving left, front is at left, so head at 48.\n\nAt time T, span [48 -36T, 83 -36T].\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway I'm on, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\n0 is the x-position where I am, since I'm at (0,y).\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to know if there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars at turn 0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36), span at T: [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so same car? Or different, but same parameters.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor each, right-moving, so:\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, speed=12, span at T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, speed=12, span at T: [1 + 12T, 12 + 12T]\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35? head=-24, tail=-35, but -24 > -35, so tail at -35, head at -24, span at T: [-35 + 12T, -24 + 12T]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, three cars with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4? No, freeway 5 also (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), same as 3.\n\nBut are these different freeways? Yes, freeways 3,4,5 all have the same set of cars.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6), so head=48, tail=37, right, speed=6, span at T: [37 +6T, 48 +6T]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (48,37,right,6), so one car.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, [37+6T, 48+6T]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=6, span at T: [-11 +6T, 0 +6T] = [-11+6T, 6T]\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in these spans for each freeway at various turns.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, for each freeway, I can find the times when 0 is occupied, i.e., when there is a collision risk if I am on that row.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, collision if for some car on k, 0 in [low, high] of its span at T.\n\nThen for that k, the set of T where it is unsafe.\n\nBut since I start at T=0, and we go to some T, I need for each row, the forbidden times.\n\nBut I need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, since I want to minimize H, I should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\ny from 0 to 9, but rows 1-8 have cars.\n\nI start at y=0 at T=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T, but since no cars on y=9, it's fine.\n\nThe minimal time to reach y=9 is 9 turns if I go up every turn, but I might hit a car.\n\nSo let's find for each row, when it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\n0 in [48-36T, 83-36T] if 48-36T <= 0 <= 83-36T\n\nSince 48-36T <= 0 and 0 <= 83-36T\n\nFirst inequality: 48-36T <= 0 => 36T >= 48 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T>=2 since T integer? Turn T is integer, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 83-36T => 36T <= 83 => T <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T <= 2\n\nT >= 4/3 ≈1.333, so T=2? T=2: 48-72 = -24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 is in [-24,11], yes.\n\nT=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=2: [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], 0 in.\n\nT=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: y=2, same car, same as y=1, so unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3, three cars.\n\nFirst car: [37+12T, 48+12T]\n\n0 in [37+12T, 48+12T] if 37+12T <=0 and 0<=48+12T? No.\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <=0 <= high.\n\nSo for first car: low=37+12T, high=48+12T\n\n37+12T <=0 <=48+12T\n\nBut 37+12T <=0 => 12T <= -37, impossible since T>=0, 37+12T >=37>0, so low>0, so 0 not in, since low>0.\n\nSimilarly, high=48+12T>0, but low>0, so 0 < low, not in interval.\n\nSo first car never has 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: [1+12T, 12+12T]\n\n0 in [1+12T, 12+12T] if 1+12T <=0 <=12+12T\n\n1+12T <=0 => 12T <= -1, impossible, T>=0.\n\nSo low=1+12T >=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-35+12T, -24+12T]\n\n0 in [-35+12T, -24+12T] if -35+12T <=0 <= -24+12T\n\nFirst: -35+12T <=0 => 12T <=35 => T <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so T<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12T => 12T >=24 => T>=2\n\nSo T=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included? <= high, so 0 <= 0 is true, so yes, 0 in [-11,0] at T=2.\n\nT=2: low=-35+24= -11, high=-24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the upper bound, so 0 <= 0 is true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nT=3: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=1: low=-35+12= -23, high=-24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=2, third car has 0 in span.\n\nTherefore for y=3, unsafe at T=2 because of the third car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: y=4, same as y=3, so unsafe at T=2.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, same, unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6, one car: (48,37,right,6), span [37+6T, 48+6T]\n\n0 in [37+6T, 48+6T]?\n\n37+6T <=0 <=48+6T\n\n37+6T <=0 => 6T <= -37, impossible.\n\nSo never unsafe for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: y=7, same car, [37+6T,48+6T], low>0, so never unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8, two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as y=6 and 7, [37+6T,48+6T], low>0, never unsafe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), span [-11+6T, 0+6T] = [-11+6T, 6T]\n\n0 in [-11+6T, 6T] if -11+6T <=0 <=6T\n\nFirst: -11+6T <=0 => 6T <=11 => T <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so T<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6T => T>=0\n\nAlso, since 0 <= 6T, T>=0, and -11+6T <=0 for T<=1.\n\nNow, at T=0: low=-11, high=0, so [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=1: low=-11+6=-5, high=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=2: low=-11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=0 and T=1, 0 is in the span.\n\nAt T=0, high=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nSimilarly T=1, low=-5<=0<=6 true.\n\nSo for y=8, unsafe at T=0 and T=1.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the unsafe turns:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=6: always safe? No cars or cars never at 0? We have cars, but for y=6, the car span never covers 0, similarly y=7.\n\ny=6: freeway 6 has one car, but as above, low=37+6T >=37>0, so 0 never in span, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7: always safe.\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=0 and T=1\n\ny=1 to 5 all unsafe at T=2 only? y=1,2,3,4,5 all have unsafe at T=2.\n\ny=3,4,5 have unsafe at T=2, y=1 and 2 also at T=2.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=0 and T=1.\n\nI start at T=0, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnsafe turns:\n\n- At T=0, only y=8 is unsafe, but I start at y=0, so no issue.\n\n- At T=1, y=8 is unsafe.\n\n- At T=2, y=1,2,3,4,5 are unsafe.\n\n- For T>=3, all rows safe except y=8 was unsafe at T=0,1 only, so for T>=2, y=8 is safe? At T=2, y=8: let's check.\n\ny=8 at T=2: cars: first car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60]? For freeway 8, cars: first car [37+6T,48+6T], at T=2, [37+12=49,48+12=60], not 0.\n\nSecond car [-11+6T,6T], at T=2, [-11+12=1,12], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo y=8 safe at T=2 and later.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 to 5 only unsafe at T=2.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T_final.\n\nBut since y=9 safe always, no issue.\n\nThe path: I start at T=0, y=0.\n\nAt T=0, I take action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\nThen at T=1, I am at y_1, and so on.\n\nI need to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe at that turn.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If at turn T, I am on row y, and y is unsafe at T, then collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nFor example, at T=0, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nAfter action a_0, I go to y_1 at T=1.\n\nAt T=1, I am at y_1, which must not be unsafe.\n\nUnsafe at T=1: only y=8 is unsafe at T=1.\n\nSo at T=1, I must not be on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=2, y=1,2,3,4,5 are unsafe, so I must not be on these rows at T=2.\n\nFor other times, all rows safe.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0, and want to reach y=9, I need to go up.\n\nBut at T=2, I cannot be on y=1 to 5.\n\nSo possible strategies:\n\n- Be above y=5 by T=2.\n\n- Or be below y=1 by T=2, but y=0 is safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=6 and 7 are always safe, I can be on them at T=2.\n\nAlso, y=8 at T=2 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, let's see the timeline.\n\nAt T=0: position y_0 = 0\n\nTake action a_0, go to y_1.\n\nAt T=1: position y_1, must not be 8, because unsafe.\n\nThen take action a_1, go to y_2.\n\nAt T=2: position y_2, must not be in {1,2,3,4,5}\n\nThen for T>=3, all safe, so I can go directly to y=9.\n\nNow, I need y_{H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nThe actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nSince from T=3 onwards, no danger, I can move up freely.\n\nBut I need to be at a position at T=2 such that I can reach y=9 in the remaining turns.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 0 to 9, min 9 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut with obstacles, might be more.\n\nAt T=2, I need to be at y_2 not in {1,2,3,4,5}, so y_2 <=0 or y_2 >=6.\n\ny_2 <=0: since I start at y=0, and can go down to y=0, but y=0 is safe.\n\ny_2 >=6: y=6,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut at T=2, y_2=9 might be possible, but let's see the path.\n\nFrom T=0 to T=1: I go from y_0=0 to y_1.\n\ny_1 can be 0,1, or -1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_1 can be 0 or 1, since from y=0, if U, y=1; if S, y=0; if D, y= -1 invalid, so only U or S, so y_1 =0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, from any y, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with delta in {-1,0,1}, but clamped to [0,9], so from y=0, cannot go down, only S or U, to y=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, cannot go up, only S or D.\n\nNow, at T=1, y_1 must not be 8.\n\nSo possible y_1: since from y=0, y_1=0 or 1.\n\nNeither is 8, so both are fine. y_1 cannot be 8 anyway from y=0.\n\ny_1=0 or 1, both not 8, so at T=1, no problem, since only y=8 is unsafe, and I'm not on it.\n\nThen at T=1, I take action a_1, go to y_2.\n\ny_2 must not be in {1,2,3,4,5} at T=2.\n\nNow, y_2 depends on y_1 and a_1.\n\nCase 1: if at T=1, y_1=0, then a_1 can be S or U, so y_2=0 or 1.\n\nBut y_2=0 or 1, and at T=2, y=1 is unsafe, y=0 is safe.\n\nSo if y_2=1, unsafe; if y_2=0, safe.\n\nBut I need to avoid y_2=1.\n\nSo from y_1=0, I must choose a_1=S, so y_2=0.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=1, which is unsafe at T=2.\n\nCase 2: if at T=1, y_1=1, then from y=1, I can go to y_2=0 (D), 1 (S), or 2 (U).\n\nAt T=2, y=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo to avoid unsafe, I must have y_2=0, by choosing D.\n\nIf S, y_2=1, unsafe; if U, y_2=2, unsafe.\n\nOnly D to y_2=0 is safe.\n\nBut y_2=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, from T=0, I had choices for a_0.\n\nIf a_0=S, then y_1=0, then a_1 must be S, y_2=0.\n\nIf a_0=U, then y_1=1, then a_1 must be D, y_2=0.\n\nIn both cases, I end up at y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nAnd I have used two turns to stay at y=0.\n\nThen from T=2, y_2=0, I can start going up.\n\nFrom y=0, at T=2, I take action to go to y_3.\n\nSince for T>=3, all rows safe, I can go directly up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves: U,U,U,...U, 9 times, but since each U increases y by 1, from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nBut at which turn?\n\nAt T=2, y_2=0.\n\nThen after action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + delta.\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_2=S, y_3=0\n\na_2=D invalid, so only U or S.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, I should go up every turn.\n\nSo from T=2, y_2=0, I can do:\n\nT=2: a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nT=3: a_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nUp to T=10: a_10=U, y_11=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt T=2, position y_2=0.\n\nAction at T=2: a_2, to y_3\n\nT=3: a_3, to y_4\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions from T=2, I reach y_{2+k}\n\nSet y_{2+k} = 9.\n\nSince y_2=0, I need k=9 up moves to reach y=9 at step 2+9=11? y_{2+k} = k, since start from 0, each up move.\n\ny_2=0\n\nAfter first up: y_3=1\n\ny_4=2\n\n...\n\ny_{11} = 9\n\nBecause from y_2 to y_3 is first move, to y_3=1, then to y_4=2, ..., after 9 moves, y_{11}=9.\n\nThe turn when y=9 is T=11.\n\nH is such that y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, position at t_1 + H -1 = H-1 since t_1=0.\n\ny_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, with the above, at T=2, y_2=0, then after 9 up moves, at T=11, y_11=9, so H-1=11, thus H=12.\n\nActions from t=0 to 11? t from 0 to H-1, so if H=12, actions t=0 to 11, 12 actions, but positions from y_0 to y_12.\n\ny_{H-1} = y_{11} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nIn the above, I stayed at y=0 for two turns, then took 9 turns to go up, total 11 turns to reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut H-1=11, H=12 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=H-1, H actions.\n\nPosition after H actions is y_H.\n\nBut we need y_{H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, with no obstacles, if I go up every turn from t=0:\n\nt=0: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: a_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\nt=8: a_8=U, y_9=9\n\nSo at T=9, y_9=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9? t=0 to H-1=9, so actions t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? That's 10 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 9 inclusive is 10 actions.\n\nPosition: after a_0, y_1=1; after a_1, y_2=2; ... after a_8, y_9=9; then a_9 is not needed, but in the sequence, we have actions up to a_{H-1} with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, with obstacles, at T=2, I must not be on y=1-5.\n\nIn the direct up path, at T=2, I would be at y=2 if I went up twice, but y=2 is unsafe at T=2.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I delayed by staying at y=0.\n\nBut I could be on y=6 or higher at T=2.\n\nFor example, from T=0 to T=1, I can only reach y=0 or 1, as above.\n\nThen from T=1 to T=2, if I am at y_1=0, I can go to y_2=0 or 1, but both not >=6.\n\nIf y_1=1, I can go to y_2=0,1,2, all <=2<6.\n\nSo at T=2, I cannot be at y>=6 because from start, in two moves, max I can go to y=2 (U,U).\n\ny_0=0\n\na_0=U: y_1=1\n\na_1=U: y_2=2\n\nOr if a_0=S, y_1=0, a_1=U, y_2=1\n\nOr a_0=U, y_1=1, a_1=S, y_2=1\n\nOr a_0=U, y_1=1, a_1=D, y_2=0\n\nAll y_2 <=2 <6.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be below 0.\n\nSo at T=2, possible y_2: 0 or 1 or 2, but y=1 and 2 are unsafe, so only y_2=0 is safe, as I had.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9, which takes 9 up moves, reaching y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, y=9.\n\nNow, H-1=11, so H=12.\n\nActions: t=0 to t=11.\n\nBut at T=2, y_2=0, then I go up each turn to T=11.\n\nIn terms of actions: to have y_2=0, as above.\n\nFor example, one way: a_0=S, so y_1=0\n\nThen a_1=S, so y_2=0\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\na_10=U, y_11=9? Let's list:\n\nT: position y_t\n\nt=0: y_0=0\n\na_0=S: y_1=0\n\nt=1: y_1=0\n\na_1=S: y_2=0\n\nt=2: y_2=0\n\na_2=U: y_3=1\n\nt=3: y_3=1\n\na_3=U: y_4=2\n\nt=4: y_4=2\n\na_4=U: y_5=3\n\nt=5: y_5=3\n\na_5=U: y_6=4\n\nt=6: y_6=4\n\na_6=U: y_7=5\n\nt=7: y_7=5\n\na_7=U: y_8=6\n\nt=8: y_8=6\n\na_8=U: y_9=7\n\nt=9: y_9=7\n\na_9=U: y_10=8\n\nt=10: y_10=8\n\na_10=U: y_11=9\n\nt=11: y_11=9\n\nNow, at t=11, y_11=9, which is what we want, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10? Actions: a_0 to a_10, that's 11 actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, with H-1=11, so H=12, actions t=0 to 11.\n\nIn the above, I have actions up to a_10, which gives y_11.\n\nBut I need one more action? No.\n\ny_{H-1} = y_{11} =9, so the last action is at t=10? Let's see.\n\nThe position at turn T is after the action of previous turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we get y_{T+1}.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_t for t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1, here t_1=0, so t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, we have y_H, but we don't care about y_H, we need y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn the above sequence:\n\nAt turn t=0: y_0=0, take a_0\n\nThen y_1=0\n\nTurn t=1: y_1=0, take a_1, y_2=0\n\nTurn t=2: y_2=0, take a_2, y_3=1\n\n...\n\nTurn t=10: y_10=8, take a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nNow, at turn t=10, y_10=8, not 9.\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9.\n\nBut we need y_{H-1}=9, so at turn H-1, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=11, y_11=9.\n\nSo H-1=11, thus H=12.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=11? t=0 to 11 inclusive is 12 actions.\n\nBut in the path above, I have actions a_0 to a_10, that's 11 actions, leading to y_11 at turn 11.\n\nBut for y_{H-1}=9, with H-1=11, so we need actions up to a_{10}? Let's index.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nAt T=0: position y_0=0, take action a_0\n\nResult: y_1\n\nAt T=1: position y_1, take a_1, result y_2\n\n...\n\nAt T=k: position y_k, take a_k, result y_{k+1}\n\nWe need y_m =9 for some m, and m = t_1 + H -1 = H-1 since t_1=0.\n\nSo y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, we have y_H, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is a_{H-1}, and at that turn, position y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn my path: to have y_m=9 with m=H-1.\n\nIn the sequence I have y_11=9 at T=11.\n\nSo m=11, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_11.\n\nBut in my earlier list, I have a_0 to a_10, which sets y_11, but at T=11, y_11=9, and I need to take action a_11? But if I take a_11, y_12 might be something, but since I am already at y=9, I can stay or whatever, but the position at turn H-1=11 is y_11=9, which is fine.\n\nThe actions include a_{H-1}, which is taken at turn H-1, when y_{H-1}=9.\n\nFor example, at turn m, y_m=9, I take a_m, which could be S or D, but since I reached, it doesn't matter, but I need to specify the action.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list actions until I reach.\n\nIn this case, with H=12, actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nAt t=11, I am at y_11=9, and I take some action, say S, to stay, but y_12=9, but we don't care.\n\nBut the minimal H is when I reach as early as possible.\n\nIn this path, I reach at T=11.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=2, I must be at y_2=0, as only option.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe fastest is to go up each turn, so from y_2=0 to y_3=1, y_4=2, ..., y_11=9, so 9 steps up, from T=2 to T=11.\n\nT=2 y_2=0, after one up, T=3 y_3=1, ..., after k up moves, at T=2+k, y_{2+k} = k.\n\nSet k=9, y_{11}=9.\n\nSo T=11 is the earliest possible to reach y=9, since at T=2 I am at 0.\n\nIf I could be higher at T=2, but I can't, as max y_2=2, but y=2 is unsafe at T=2, so I cannot be at y=2 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=1.\n\nSo y_2 must be 0, so I am stuck at 0 until T=2.\n\nThen from T=2, go up.\n\nBut at T=3, when I go to y_3=1, is it safe? T=3, all rows safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the actions, for the first two turns, I need to stay at y=0.\n\nI can do a_0=S, a_1=S, or a_0=U, a_1=D, both lead to y_2=0.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, same.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to list.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need minimal H.\n\nH=12, with y_11=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go up at T=0: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen at T=1, y_1=1, I must not be on y=8, but I am on y=1, not 8, ok.\n\nThen a_1, I need to go to y_2 not in {1,2,3,4,5}, so I must go down to y_2=0 (since from y=1, D to y=0).\n\nIf I go S, y_2=1, unsafe; U, y_2=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only D to y_2=0.\n\nThen same as before, y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen same path up.\n\nSo same thing.\n\nCannot reach earlier than T=11.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at an earlier turn if I go faster, but I can't, since min 9 moves from y=0.\n\nBut at T=2, I am at y=0, so from there, min 9 turns to y=9.\n\ny=9 at T=11.\n\nH-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe turns.\n\nAt T=2, y=1 to 5 unsafe.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, car at T=2: [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], 0 in.\n\ny=2: same.\n\ny=3: from freeway 3, third car at T=2: [-35+24, -24+24]=[-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSimilarly y=4,5 same.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, car [37+12,48+12]? T=2, [37+12=49? Speed 6, T=2, [37+12=49,48+12=60], 49 to 60, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly y=7 same.\n\ny=8 at T=2: second car [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nSince I need to stay at y=0 for first two turns, I can choose, for example, a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2 to a_10 all U.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=11? H=12, actions t=0 to 11.\n\nBut with a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2=U, a_3=U, ..., a_10=U, then at t=10, y_10=8? Let's list positions.\n\nt: action a_t, then y_{t+1}\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, with a_0=S: after a_0, y_1=0\n\na_1=S: y_2=0\n\na_2=U: y_3=1\n\na_3=U: y_4=2\n\na_4=U: y_5=3\n\na_5=U: y_6=4\n\na_6=U: y_7=5\n\na_7=U: y_8=6\n\na_8=U: y_9=7\n\na_9=U: y_10=8\n\na_10=U: y_11=9\n\nNow, at turn t=10, y_10=8, not 9.\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9.\n\nBut we need y_{H-1}=9, so here y_11=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nNow at turn t=11, y_11=9, I need to take action a_11, which could be S or D, but since I am at y=9, I can do S to stay, or D to go to 8, but we only care about reaching at turn H-1=11.\n\nIn the action sequence, I need to include a_{11}, but it doesn't affect reaching, since I am already at 9 at turn 11.\n\nTo minimize H, H=12 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 11 actions: a_0 to a_10, I have y_11=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut actions are from t=0 to H-1, and y_{H-1}=9.\n\nWith actions a_0 to a_{10}, that is t=0 to 10, so H-1=10? Then y_{10} should be 9.\n\nBut in above, y_10=8, not 9.\n\ny_10=8 after a_9? Let's index:\n\nAfter a_9: y_10=8 (since a_9=U from y_9=7 to y_10=8)\n\nThen after a_10: y_11=9\n\nSo y_10=8, y_11=9.\n\nTo have y_m=9, I need m=11, so H-1=11, H=12, actions t=0 to 11.\n\nAt t=11, I take a_11, say S, to stay at y=9.\n\nThen y_12=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, I can have a_11=S.\n\nSince the goal is to reach at turn H-1, and H is the number of actions, but with H actions, I reach position at turn H.\n\nBut we need position at turn H-1 to be 9.\n\nIn this case, it is fine.\n\nTo save one action, but I think I cannot, because I need to be at y=0 at T=2, so I cannot reach y=9 before T=11.\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 at some point.\n\nBut at T=2, I must be at y=0, so no.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at T=9 if I could, but at T=2 I am at 0, so impossible.\n\nMinimal turns to reach y=9 from y=0 is 9, but I lose 2 turns at start, so 11 turns to be at y=9.\n\nTurn when position is 9.\n\nAt T=0: y=0\n\nAfter 9 up moves, at T=9: y=9, if no delay.\n\nBut with delay, at T=11.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for the sequence, I can choose a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2 to a_10 all U, but a_10 brings to y_11=9, but I need one more action? No.\n\nWith a_0 to a_10: 11 actions, y_11=9.\n\nSo H-1=11, H=12, so actions up to a_11.\n\nSo I need to add a_11.\n\nSimilarly, if I do a_0=U, a_1=D, then same.\n\na_0=U: y_1=1\n\na_1=D: y_2=0 (from y=1, D to 0)\n\nThen a_2=U: y_3=1\n\n...\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow in the sequence, with a_0=S, a_1=S, a_2=U, a_3=U, ..., a_10=U, then a_11, say S.\n\na_10=U brings y_11=9 from y_10=8.\n\nThen at t=11, y_11=9, I take a_11=S, y_12=9.\n\nBut since y_11=9, it is fine.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but I think I have to include it.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by going to safe rows.\n\nAnother idea: at T=1, I am at y_1=0 or 1.\n\ny=6 and 7 are safe at all times, but I cannot reach them by T=2.\n\nFor example, from T=0 to T=1: to y_1=0 or 1\n\nT=1 to T=2: from y_1, I can only reach y_2=0,1,2 if y_1=1, or 0,1 if y_1=0.\n\nAll low.\n\nThen at T=3, I can be at y=3, for example, but since from T=3 safe, I can go up fast.\n\nBut from T=2 y_2=0, to y_3=1, etc., same as before.\n\nIf at T=2 I am at y=0, then min to y=9 is 9 moves, arrive at T=11.\n\nPerhaps I can go down at some point, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=0 at T=0,1,2, then up, same.\n\nOr if I stay longer, worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nNow for the action sequence.\n\nI need to output the actions from turn t_1=0.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, at T=0 and T=1, unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nIn the path, when I go to y=8, at T=10, y_10=8, which is safe, since T=10>1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nTurn 0: S  (y_1=0)\n\nTurn 1: S  (y_2=0)\n\nTurn 2: U  (y_3=1)\n\nTurn 3: U  (y_4=2)\n\nTurn 4: U  (y_5=3)\n\nTurn 5: U  (y_6=4)\n\nTurn 6: U  (y_7=5)\n\nTurn 7: U  (y_8=6)\n\nTurn 8: U  (y_9=7)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y_10=8)\n\nTurn 10: U  (y_11=9)\n\nNow at turn 10, y_10=8, after a_10=U, y_11=9.\n\nBut we need y_{H-1}=9, so at turn H-1, position 9.\n\nHere at turn 10, position is 8, not 9.\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9, so at turn 11, y_11=9.\n\nSo I need to include action at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: S (for example, to stay)\n\nThen y_12=9, but y_11=9.\n\nSo actions: turn 0 to turn 11.\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U  (y_11=9)\n\nNow at turn 10, after a_10=U, y_11=9.\n\nAt turn 10, position y_10=8, I take a_10=U, go to y_11=9.\n\nThen for turn 11, I am at y_11=9, I need to take a_11, say S.\n\nBut the position at turn 11 is already 9, which is what we want for y_{H-1}=9 with H-1=11.\n\nSo with actions up to a_10, we have y_11=9 at turn 11.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10, that is 11 actions, H-1=10? t from 0 to H-1, if H=11, actions t=0 to 10, then y_{H-1}=y_{10}, which should be 9.\n\nBut in this case, y_10=8, not 9.\n\ny_10 is position at turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence with a_0 to a_9: let's list turns and positions.\n\nTurn t | position y_t | action a_t | resulting y_{t+1}\n\nt=0: y_0=0, a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nt=1: y_1=0, a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nt=2: y_2=0, a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3: y_3=1, a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: y_4=2, a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y_5=3, a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y_6=4, a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y_7=5, a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y_9=7, a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y_10=8, a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nNow at turn t=10, y_10=8, not 9.\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9.\n\nTo have y_m=9 at some m.\n\nHere y_11=9 at turn 11.\n\nSo for y_{H-1}=9, we need H-1=11, so H=12.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nAt t=11: y_11=9, take a_11, say S, then y_12=9.\n\nBut y_11=9 is what we need.\n\nIn the sequence, I can set a_11=S.\n\nTo make it clean.\n\nAnother sequence: if I go up immediately but down at T=1.\n\na_0=U: at t=0, y_0=0, a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: y_1=1, a_1=D, y_2=0\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen a_2 to a_10 U, but a_10 U from y_10=8 to y_11=9.\n\nThen need a_11.\n\nSame H.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 8 has a car at (0,-11,right,6), at T=0, span [-11,0], which includes 0, so unsafe.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence can be:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nIn the last action, I put S, but it could be anything, since I am at goal.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1=0.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSince t_1=0, it should be Turn 0: ..., Turn 1: ..., etc.\n\nWith H=12, up to Turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 12 actions.\n\nTo write it.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can have fewer actions.\n\nSuppose at T=2, I am at y_2=0.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9.\n\nEach up move increases y by one, so from y=0 to y=9, 9 up moves needed, taking 9 turns, so from T=2 to T=11 for y_11=9.\n\nIf I do some stay, it takes more.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=12.\n\nNow for the sequence, I'll use the first one with stay at beginning.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S  (or U, but y=9, cannot up, so S or D, but D to 8, not good, so S to stay)\n\nSince at y=9, I can only S or D, but D would decrease, so better to S.\n\nIn the action, at turn 11, y_11=9, I take S to stay at 9.\n\nBut since I already reached, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, I can stop earlier, but according to the problem, I need to specify actions until H-1 with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nHere with H=12, y_{11}=9.\n\nSo I need to include a_{11}.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where at turn 10, y_10=9, but how?\n\nIf I start from y_0=0, to y_10=9, I need 9 up moves in 10 turns? But with the constraint at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, I must be at y=0, so for example, if I do a_0=S, y_1=0; a_1=S, y_2=0; then to reach y_10=9, I need from y_2=0 to y_10=9 in 8 moves, but 8 moves can increase y by at most 8, so y_10 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny_2=0 at T=2, after 8 actions, y_{10} <= 8, since max increase 8.\n\nThen y_10 <=8, so at T=10, y_10 <=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need at least T=11 with y_11=9.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence as above.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nI think I should write it.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the player must account for the unsafe turns identified for each freeway:\n\n- Freeways y=1, y=2, y=3, y=4, and y=5 are unsafe at turn T=2.\n- Freeway y=8 is unsafe at turns T=0 and T=1.\n- Freeways y=6 and y=7 are always safe.\n\nGiven these constraints, the player must not be on freeways y=1 to y=5 at turn T=2 or on y=8 at turns T=0 and T=1. Starting at (0, 0) at turn T=0, the only safe positions at turn T=2 are y=0 or y=6 and above, but it is impossible to reach y=6 or higher by T=2 due to movement constraints (maximum y=2 after two up moves, but y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at T=2). Thus, the player must be at y=0 at turn T=2.\n\nTo achieve y=0 at T=2:\n- At turn T=0, if the player moves up (U), y=1 is reached at T=1. Then at T=1, moving down (D) is required to reach y=0 at T=2 (since staying or moving up would leave y=1 or y=2, both unsafe at T=2).\n- At turn T=0, if the player stays (S), y=0 is reached at T=1. Then at T=1, staying (S) is required to reach y=0 at T=2 (moving up would reach y=1, unsafe at T=2).\n\nBoth paths result in y=0 at T=2. For minimal turns, after T=2, the player should move up (U) every turn to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, as all freeways are safe for T≥3.\n\nThe sequence with staying at the beginning is chosen for simplicity:\n- Actions: S at T=0, S at T=1, then U from T=2 to T=10, and finally S at T=11 to remain at y=9.\n- This results in y_{11} = 9 at turn T=11, so H-1 = 11 and H = 12 (actions from t=0 to t=11).\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is 12, with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: S \\\\\nTurn 1: S \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway k from 1 to 8, and they move left or right at given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new row until the next turn. So if you move to y+1 at turn T, you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1, so you only check for collision on y at turn T if you're staying or moving vertically, but since you move vertically, at turn T you are on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are on y_T, so collision is checked for y_T at turn T.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are only on one freeway, y_T, and you only care about cars on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nWhen you take an action at turn T, you are at position (0, y_T). Based on action a_T, you move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen, at turn T, collision is checked: is there a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and you check for cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nIn this case, since the player starts at turn t_1, which is given as t_0=1, position (0,0).\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=1, player at (0,0).\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but there are freeways only from y=1 to y=8; y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, so no cars there. The vertical axis is y=0 to y=9, and freeways are at y=1 to y=8 for cars. So y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0), which is y=0, so at turn 1, y_1=0, which has no freeway, so no collision possible at y=0. Similarly, when reaching y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9), so when y_t =9 for some t, we are done.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 onwards, so we start at t_1=1, y=0.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway k=1 to 8, there are cars with given positions at turn t_1=1.\n\nI need to find the minimal H and actions such that after H-1 actions? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, total H actions.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, we have y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe position is updated after action: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nAfter H actions, from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1, we have taken H actions, so we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, we take one action at t_1, then at t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}.\n\nSince y_{t_1}=0, to reach y=9, we need to increase y by 9, so minimum 9 moves up, but we can move faster? No, each action changes y by at most 1, so minimum 9 up actions to go from 0 to 9, but we might need to wait or avoid, so H could be more than 9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from start to end, we have H actions, so we go from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H, so the number of turns elapsed is H.\n\nWe start at y_{t_1} =0, end at y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe change in y is +9, each action contributes -1,0,or+1 to Δy, so the sum of Δy over H actions must be +9.\n\nSince |Δy| <=1, we need at least 9 actions, so H >=9.\n\nIf we only go up, H=9, y_{t_1 +9} =9.\n\nBut we might have to avoid cars, so we might need to go down or stay sometimes, increasing H.\n\nOr if we can go straight up without collision, H=9.\n\nBut we need to check if that's possible with the given cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars at turn t_1=1 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head h=12, tail τ=47, direction left, speed s=36)\n\nDirection left means moving left, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] since left-moving.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] because it says: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ], at T [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h=12, τ=47, so from 12 to 47, and since moving left, decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor freeway 3, cars: (60,49,right,12) so τ=49, h=60? It says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, head and tail: I think head is the front, so for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h < τ, I think.\n\nLet's see freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, and [h,τ] = [12,47], moving left, so at T, [12 -36(T-1), 47-36(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49,60], I assume τ=49, h=60, so [49,60] at t_1=1.\n\nThen at T, [49 +12(T-1), 60+12(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, (24,13,right,12): τ=13, h=24, span [13,24] at t_1.\n\nAnd (-12,-23,right,12): τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23,-12] at t_1.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: (54,43,right,6) so one car, right-moving, τ=43, h=54, span [43,54] at t_1=1.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (54,43,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\n(6,-5,right,6): τ=-5, h=6, span [-5,6] at t_1=1.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at time T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, we care when 0 is in the span.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each time, we need to know if 0 is occupied, i.e., if there is a car covering x=0 at that time.\n\nThe player starts at turn 1, y=0. y=0 has no freeway, so no collision at turn 1.\n\nAt turn 1, we take action a_1, then at turn 2, we are at y_2.\n\nAt turn 2, if y_2 between 1 and 8, we need to check for collision on that freeway at time 2.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince we start at turn 1, y=0, and we want to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe earliest possible is turn 10: if we go up every turn, at turn 1: y=0, action U, turn 2: y=1, action U, ..., up to turn 10: after 9 up actions, at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut we might be blocked by cars.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway k, at each time t, if x=0 is occupied.\n\nIf at some time, for a freeway, 0 is occupied, then we cannot be on that freeway at that time.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway k=1 to 8, for times t starting from t=1 onwards, when x=0 is covered.\n\nt is turn number, global.\n\nt_1=1 is current turn.\n\nFor freeway k, at time t, the span of each car is computed based on t.\n\nThen, if for any car on k, 0 is in [min, max] of the span.\n\nSince the span is an interval, we can find when 0 is in that interval for each car.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=12, τ=47, s=36.\n\nSpan at time t: [12 - 36(t-1), 47 - 36(t-1)] = [12 -36(t-1), 47-36(t-1)]\n\n0 is in this span if 12 -36(t-1) <= 0 <= 47-36(t-1)\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: 12 -36(t-1) <= 0 => 12 <= 36(t-1) => (t-1) >= 12/36 = 1/3, so t-1 >= 1 since t integer, t >= 2\n\n12/36 = 1/3, so for t-1 >= ceil(1/3) =1, since t-1 integer.\n\n12 -36(t-1) <= 0 when 36(t-1) >=12, so t-1 >= 12/36 = 1/3, since t-1 integer, t-1 >=1, so t >=2\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= 47-36(t-1) => 36(t-1) <=47 => t-1 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so t-1 <=1 since integer, t<=2\n\nt-1 <= floor(47/36) = floor(1.305) =1\n\nSo 0 <= 47-36(t-1) when 36(t-1) <=47, t-1 <= 47/36≈1.305, so t-1 <=1, t<=2\n\nAnd from left, t>=2\n\nSo both: t>=2 and t<=2, so only at t=2, 0 is in the span.\n\nAt t=1: span [12 -36(0), 47-36(0)] = [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nt=2: [12-36(1), 47-36(1)] = [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11], -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nt=3: [12-36(2), 47-36(2)] = [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (12,47,left,36), so same, occupied only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) — head h=60, tail τ=49? For right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [49,60]? τ=49, h=60, so [49,60] at t=1.\n\nAt time t: [τ + s(t-1), h + s(t-1)] = [49 +12(t-1), 60+12(t-1)]\n\n0 in span: 49+12(t-1) <= 0 <= 60+12(t-1)\n\nLeft: 49+12(t-1) <=0 => 12(t-1) <= -49, impossible since t-1>=0, 49+12(t-1) >=49>0, so never <=0. Thus 0 not in for this car, since min is at least 49.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,12), τ=13, h=24, span at t=1: [13,24]\n\nAt t: [13+12(t-1), 24+12(t-1)]\n\nMin: 13+12(t-1) >=13>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,12), τ=-23, h=-12, span at t=1: [-23,-12]\n\nAt t: [ -23 +12(t-1), -12 +12(t-1) ]\n\n0 in span: -23 +12(t-1) <= 0 <= -12 +12(t-1)\n\nLeft: -23 +12(t-1) <=0 => 12(t-1) <=23 => t-1 <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so t-1 <=1, t<=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +12(t-1) => 12 <= 12(t-1) => t-1 >=1, t>=2\n\nSo t>=2 and t<=2, only at t=2.\n\nThus for freeway 3, occupied only by third car at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so occupied only at t=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same, occupied at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: (54,43,right,6), τ=43, h=54, span at t=1: [43,54]\n\nAt t: [43 +6(t-1), 54+6(t-1)]\n\nMin 43+6(t-1) >=43>0, so never <=0, so always safe, no occupation at x=0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same as 6, no occupation.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6) same as above, no occupation.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), τ=-5, h=6, span at t=1: [-5,6]\n\nAt t: [ -5 +6(t-1), 6 +6(t-1) ]\n\n0 in span: -5 +6(t-1) <= 0 <= 6 +6(t-1)\n\nRight part always true since min of right is 6>0? 6 +6(t-1) >=6>0, so 0 <= that is true.\n\nLeft: -5 +6(t-1) <=0 => 6(t-1) <=5 => t-1 <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so t-1 <=0, t<=1\n\nSince t-1 integer.\n\nt-1 <= floor(5/6)=0? 5/6<1, so t-1 <=0, t<=1\n\nt-1 <= 5/6, since t-1 integer, t-1 <=0, so t<=1\n\nAt t=1: span [-5 +6(0), 6+6(0)] = [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\n-5 <=0<=6, yes.\n\nAt t=2: [ -5+6(1), 6+6(1)] = [1,12], 1<=0? 1>0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in [1,12], so not included.\n\nAt t=1: -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nt=2: min=1>0, so 0 not <= min, not in.\n\nt=3: [ -5+12, 6+12] = [7,18], etc, all min increasing.\n\nSo for second car, occupied at t=1 only? t=1.\n\nBut freeway 8 at t=1.\n\nNow, for the player, at turn t, if on freeway k, need to check at time t.\n\nBut for freeway 8, at t=1, if player is on y=8 at turn 1, then collision possible, but player starts at y=0 at turn 1, not on freeway 8.\n\nNow, summary for each freeway and time when occupied at x=0:\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied at t=2\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at t=2\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied at t=2\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied at t=2\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at t=2\n\n- Freeway 6: never occupied\n\n- Freeway 7: never occupied\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at t=1 by second car, and only at t=1? For the first car, no, second car at t=1 only.\n\nAt t=1, for freeway 8, second car span [-5,6] includes 0.\n\nBut at other times, no.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied only at t=1.\n\nNow, for freeway 6 and 7, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8 safe except at t=1.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nPlayer at turn 1: y=0, no freeway, safe.\n\nWe take action a_1, go to y_2 at turn 2.\n\nAt turn 2, y_2 could be 1, or if stay or down, but we start at 0, if down, y= -1 not possible, since y in [0,9], so at turn 1, possible actions: U to y=1, S to y=0, D to y=0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, D: Δy=-1, but y=0-1=-1 not allowed, so I think y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=0, cannot go down, similarly from y=9 cannot go up.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U (to y=1) or S (stay y=0)\n\nSimilarly at y=9, D or S.\n\nNow at turn 1, y=0, we can do S or U.\n\nIf we do U, then at turn 2, y=1.\n\nIf we do S, at turn 2, still y=0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, we can go up 9 times, reach at turn 10.\n\nBut with cars, we need to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for freeways 1 to 5, they are occupied only at t=2.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied only at t=1.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nNow, at turn 2, freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are all occupied at x=0.\n\nSo if we are on any of y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 2, we collide.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, etc.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nSo at turn 2, if we are on y=1,2,3,4, or 5, we collide.\n\nBut at turn 2, we are at y_2.\n\ny_2 depends on action at turn 1.\n\nAt turn 1, we are at y=0.\n\nIf we go up (U), then at turn 2, y=1, which is freeway 1, and occupied at t=2, so collision.\n\nIf we stay (S), at turn 2, y=0, which has no freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen at turn 2, we can take action.\n\nWe need to go up eventually.\n\nBut at turn 2, if we are on y=0, we can go U to y=1 at turn 3.\n\nNow, at turn 3, what freeways are occupied?\n\nWe need to check for each k at t=3.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nFreeway 1: occupied only t=2, so at t=3, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2,3,4,5: only occupied t=2, so at t=3, safe.\n\nFreeway 6,7: always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: occupied only t=1, so at t=3, safe.\n\nSo at t=3, all freeways are safe.\n\nSimilarly for later times.\n\nNow, we also need to consider the time to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at t=1, y=0.\n\nIf we go up directly at t=1, we collide at t=2 on y=1.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe must avoid being on y=1 to 5 at t=2.\n\nThe only way is to not be on those rows at t=2.\n\nSince from y=0, we can only be at y=0 or y=1 at t=2.\n\nIf we go to y=1, we collide.\n\nIf we stay at y=0, no collision.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow at t=2, we can go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=1, and freeway 1 is safe at t=3, as we saw.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nAlso, freeway 8 is occupied at t=1, but since we never on y=8 at t=1, it's fine.\n\nNow, let's see the sequence.\n\nStart: t=1, y=0\n\nAction: if we do S, then t=2, y=0\n\nThen at t=2, action U, then t=3, y=1\n\nThen at t=3, action U, t=4, y=2\n\nAnd so on, up to t=10, y=9.\n\nAt each step, when we are on freeway, we need to check if occupied.\n\nAt t=3, y=1: freeway 1 at t=3, which is not occupied, as only t=2 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, t=4, y=2: freeway 2 at t=4, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4,5 at later times, all safe since only t=2 occupied.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8: at what time we might be on it.\n\nIn this sequence, we go up each turn from t=2 to t=10.\n\nt=2: y=0, not freeway\n\nt=3: y=1, freeway 1 at t=3, safe\n\nt=4: y=2, freeway 2 at t=4, safe\n\nt=5: y=3, freeway 3 at t=5, safe\n\nt=6: y=4, freeway 4 at t=6, safe\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5 at t=7, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6 at t=8, safe (always)\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7 at t=9, safe\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8 at t=10\n\nNow, freeway 8: occupied only at t=1, so at t=10, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, we are at y=8, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, we take action U, then at t=11, y=9.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, y=9.\n\nBut we started at t=1, and after 10 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nTurn sequence:\n\n- Turn 1: start y=0, take action S? In this plan, at t=1, we take S to stay.\n\nAction a_t at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, take a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9, with actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 1+H, y_{1+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=1: y=0, take a1=S, then y2=0\n\nt=2: y=0, take a2=U, then y3=1\n\nt=3: y=1, take a3=U, then y4=2\n\n...\n\nUp to t=9: y=8? Let's list:\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1}\n\nStart t=1, y1=0\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\nAfter a2, y3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1}\n\nWe want y_{1+H} =9.\n\ny1=0.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{1+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are a1 to a_H.\n\nIn this case, if we go up directly, but we delayed.\n\nIn the safe sequence:\n\nAt t=1: take S, so a1=S, then y2=0\n\nAt t=2: take U, a2=U, then y3=1\n\nAt t=3: take U, a3=U, then y4=2\n\n...\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nAt t=2, y2=0\n\nt=3, y3=1\n\nt=4, y4=2\n\n...\n\nt=10, y10=8\n\nt=11, y11=9\n\nSo at t=11, y11=9.\n\nWe took actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nt=1 to t=10, 10 actions.\n\nH=10, y_{1+10} = y11=9.\n\nIs this minimal?\n\nH=10, but since we must avoid the collision at t=2, we had to wait one turn.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if at t=1 we go up, we collide at t=2.\n\nPerhaps go up later, but since we start from 0, we need to pass through the freeways.\n\nAnother idea: go to a safe row earlier.\n\nBut all rows except 1-5 at t=2 are safe, but we are at y=0.\n\nFrom y=0, at t=1, if we stay, we are at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, we can go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, y=1 is safe.\n\nWe can only change y by 1 per turn, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 changes, so 9 actions if no waiting.\n\nBut here we waited one turn, so 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 or something directly, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo from 0 to 9, must take at least 9 up actions, and possibly some S or D, but D would make it worse, so S to wait.\n\nMinimal actions: 9 U actions, but we may need to insert S actions to wait.\n\nIn this case, we inserted one S at the beginning.\n\nBut can we avoid waiting?\n\nFor example, if we could be on y=1 at a different time, but at t=2, y=1 is occupied, but at other times it is safe, but we can only reach y=1 at t=2 if we go up at t=1, or later if we delay.\n\nBut since we start at t=1 y=0, if we go up at t=1, we at y=1 at t=2, collide.\n\nIf we don't go up at t=1, we reach y=1 later than t=2.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut in this case, since only t=2 is problematic for rows 1-5, and we can be on them at other times.\n\nFreeway 8 has issue at t=1, but we not on it.\n\nNow, another thing: when we go to y=8, we need to be careful, but freeway 8 occupied only at t=1, so after that safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, we go to y=8 at t=10, which is fine.\n\nBut we have H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=9.\n\nWith H=9 actions, we would reach y_{10}=9.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\ny1=0, after 9 actions, y10=9.\n\nThis requires all Δy sum to +9, so 9 U actions, no S or D.\n\nActions: a1 to a9, all U.\n\nThen:\n\nt=1: y1=0, a1=U, y2=1\n\nt=2: y2=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\n...\n\nt=9: y9=8, a9=U, y10=9\n\nNow, at each turn, when on freeway, check collision.\n\nAt t=2: y=1, freeway 1, occupied at t=2, collision! Yes.\n\nSimilarly, if we start at t=1, go up, at t=2 y=1, collide.\n\nSo impossible with H=9.\n\nThus minimal H=10.\n\nAnd the sequence is: at t=1, S; then t=2 to t=9, U; but at t=9 we are at y9=8, a9=U to y10=9.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nActions: from t=1 to t=10?

Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a1\n\nt=1: a2\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=1, H=10.\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: a1 = S\n\nt=1: a2 = U\n\nt=2: a3 = U\n\n...\n\nt=8: a9 = U  (since t from 0 to 9? t=0 to 9 is 10 actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H=10, t=0 to 9.\n\na_{1 + t} for t=0 to 9.\n\nSo a1, a2, ..., a10.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nWe have:\n\na1 = S (at turn 1)\n\nThen y2=0\n\na2 = U (at turn 2), y3=1\n\na3 = U (turn 3), y4=2\n\na4 = U (turn 4), y5=3\n\na5 = U (turn 5), y6=4\n\na6 = U (turn 6), y7=5\n\na7 = U (turn 7), y8=6\n\na8 = U (turn 8), y9=7\n\na9 = U (turn 9), y10=8\n\na10 = ? We need to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn 10, y10=8, we need to take a10 to go to y11=9.\n\nBut with H=10 actions, up to a10, then at turn 1+10=11, y11=9.\n\nIn the action list, a10 is the last action.\n\nAt turn 10, y=8, take a10=U, then y11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence above, from a1 to a9, we have y2 to y10: y2=0, y3=1, ..., y10=8.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=9.\n\nWe have 10 actions: a1=S, a2 to a10=U.\n\na2 to a10 are 9 actions U, but a1 is S, so not all U.\n\nActions: a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, ..., a10=U.\n\nSo one S and nine U.\n\nTotal H=10 actions.\n\nWe can think that we took one extra S.\n\nBut is there a way to insert the wait later?\n\nFor example, instead of waiting at the beginning, wait when going to higher rows.\n\nBut rows 1-5 are only dangerous at t=2, and since we start at t=1, we must pass through them after t=2.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=3 or later, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we need to go through all rows.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=0 for multiple turns, but that would take more time, worse.\n\nOr go down, but from y=0 cannot go down, and going down would increase time.\n\nSo minimal is to wait only one turn at start.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 6 or 7 earlier, but we have to go through lower rows first.\n\nSince we move one step at a time, we must be on each y from 0 to 9 at some point.\n\nThe only issue is at t=2 for y=1 to 5.\n\nBut since we can only be on y=1 at t=2 if we go up immediately, which causes collision, otherwise we reach later.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot reach y=1 before t=2 since we start at t=1 y=0.\n\nEarliest y=1 is t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=1 is occupied, so we must not be on y=1 at t=2, so we must be on y=1 at some later turn, say t=3 or more.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, earliest t=3 if we go up from t=1, but we cannot go up at t=1.\n\nIn any case, the minimal time to reach y=9 is t=11, with actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter turn 10 action, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nIn the action list, we have up to turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 1 to turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 action is U, to go from y=8 to y=9.\n\nIn the list above, from turn 1 to turn 10 actions.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm if freeway 8 at other times.\n\nFreeway 8: we are on it at turn 10, y=8 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied only at t=1, so at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 8, we have two cars, but at t=10, both are fine.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), at t=10: span [43 +6(10-1), 54+6(9)] = [43+54,54+54]= [97,108]? t-1=9, s=6.\n\n[43 + 6*9, 54 + 6*9] = [43+54,54+54]= [97,108], not near 0.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), at t=10: [-5 +6*9, 6+6*9] = [-5+54,6+54]= [49,60], not 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at their times, not occupied except t=2.\n\nIn our path, we on y=1 at t=3, freeway1 at t=3: span [12-36(3-1),47-36(2)] = [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], not 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=10 seems minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster to avoid something, but no, since only one time slot is bad.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 and 7 are always safe, but we still need to pass through other rows.\n\nFor example, if we could jump to y=6, but we can't, only move one step.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is: at turn 1: S, then turns 2 to 10: U.\n\nIn the action list:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 10: U\n\nBut turn 10: U to go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be written as:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut is turn 9 and 10 correct?\n\nLet's list the turns and y:\n\nTurn t | y_t | action a_t | y_{t+1}\n\nt=1: y1=0, a1=S, y2=0\n\nt=2: y2=0, a2=U, y3=1\n\nt=3: y3=1, a3=U, y4=2\n\nt=4: y4=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nt=5: y5=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6: y6=4, a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y7=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y8=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y9=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10: y10=8, a10=U, y11=9\n\nYes.\n\nActions from turn 1 to turn 10.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut H=10, and we reached at turn 11.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", so after the actions, at turn t_1 + H, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer, we need to specify the actions for each turn.\n\nBut in the sequence above, turn 1 to turn 10.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nPerhaps we can write it as above.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with less actions by not going straight.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point we go down to avoid, but that would increase y distance, so worse.\n\nOr stay at a safe row, but rows 1-5 are safe after t=2, so no need.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 6 and 7 are always safe, perhaps we can go to them faster, but we have to go through 1-5 first, which we do from t=3 onwards.\n\nMinimal is 10.\n\nPerhaps start by going up at t=1 to y=1, but collide at t=2.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 8, it has a car at t=1, but we not on it.\n\nAnd in our path, we on y=8 at t=10, fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any other time when a freeway is occupied?\n\nFor example, freeway 3: we have cars, but we saw only t=2 occupied.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nFreeway 8: only t=1.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus the minimal H is 10 with the sequence above.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 1: S, then turn 2 to 10: U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the sequence, not explicitly H.\n\nBut we have H=10.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 10 actions.\n\nNow, write it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 10. This is because the player must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), and the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are occupied at \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(t = 2\\). If the player moves up (\\(U\\)) at turn 1, they would be on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2 and collide. Therefore, the player must stay (\\(S\\)) at turn 1 to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding collision. From turn 2 onwards, the player can move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 after 10 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 1: Stay (\\(S\\)) to avoid being on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 2.\n- Turns 2 to 10: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to increment \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 2, \\(y = 0\\) (no freeway, safe).\n- At turn 3, \\(y = 1\\): Freeway 1 is not occupied at \\(t = 3\\) (only occupied at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- At turn 4, \\(y = 2\\): Freeway 2 is not occupied at \\(t = 4\\) (only occupied at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- At turn 5, \\(y = 3\\): Freeway 3 is not occupied at \\(t = 5\\) (only occupied at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- At turn 6, \\(y = 4\\): Freeway 4 is not occupied at \\(t = 6\\) (only occupied at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- At turn 7, \\(y = 5\\): Freeway 5 is not occupied at \\(t = 7\\) (only occupied at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- At turn 8, \\(y = 6\\): Freeway 6 is never occupied at \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 9, \\(y = 7\\): Freeway 7 is never occupied at \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 10, \\(y = 8\\): Freeway 8 is not occupied at \\(t = 10\\) (only occupied at \\(t = 1\\)).\n- At turn 11, \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, no freeway).\n\nThus, the sequence of actions for turns 1 to 10 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: S \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y-position accordingly. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at any turn T. The initial state is given at turn t_1 = 2, so for any turn T, I can compute the car spans relative to t_1.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1 = T - 2, so τ is the number of turns since turn 2.\n\nFor each car, given its head h, tail τ (but this τ is not the same as the time difference; I should use different notation. In the car state, tail is given as τ, but in the update, it's used as the tail position. I'll use \"tail_pos\" to avoid confusion.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail tail_pos, direction d, speed s at turn t_1=2.\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + τ = 2 + τ, where τ ≥ 0.\n\nThe span changes based on direction.\n\nIf left-moving: span at T is [h - s*τ, tail_pos - s*τ]\n\nSince it's moving left, the head and tail both decrease by s*τ.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: span at T is [tail_pos + s*τ, h + s*τ] because for right-moving, head is larger, so span is from tail_pos to h, and both increase.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and head and tail are positions, with head being the front.\n\nFor left-moving, since it's moving left, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the example.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36). If head is -24 and tail is 11, but -24 < 11, so if it's moving left, decreasing x, so head should be at higher x? I think I have confusion about head and tail.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut in the state, for freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36), so h = -24, τ = 11? But -24 < 11, so [h, τ] = [-24, 11], which is from -24 to 11, but if moving left, decreasing x, so at later time, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in state, for example, freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 12), so τ = -48, h = -59? That can't be right because for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, but -48 > -59? -48 is greater than -59, so τ = -48, h = -59, but -48 > -59, so [τ, h] = [-48, -59] which is invalid since -48 > -59, it should be from smaller to larger.\n\nI think there might be a inconsistency.\n\nLet's look at the car state for freeway 3: \"(-48, -59, right, 12)\" and it says direction right.\n\nBut according to update, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and then at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nBut if τ and h are given, for this car, τ = -48, h = -59, so [τ, h] = [-48, -59], but -48 to -59 is from higher to lower, which is not standard for an interval.\n\nPerhaps the notation [a,b] assumes a ≤ b, but here for right-moving, it says [τ, h] with τ and h such that τ ≤ h? But in the example, for freeway 3, (-48, -59, right, 12), -48 > -59, so if [τ, h] = [-48, -59], it would be empty or invalid.\n\nI think there's a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nLet's read the car update carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so for freeway 1: head = -24, tail = 11, direction left.\n\nAt t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11], which is from -24 to 11, so it's a car from x=-24 to x=11 at turn 2.\n\nSince it's moving left, at turn T, it will be at [ -24 - s(T-2), 11 - s(T-2) ] with s=36.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so for freeway 3 car: (-48, -59, right, 12), so τ = -48, h = -59, so [τ, h] = [-48, -59], but -48 to -59 is from -48 to -59, which is decreasing, so the span is from min to max? I think we need to interpret [a,b] as the interval from min(a,b) to max(a,b), but the notation says [τ, h] for right-moving, and in this case τ = -48, h = -59, so min is -59, max is -48, so the span is from -59 to -48 at t_1.\n\nBut the update says [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], with τ and h as given.\n\nFor this car, at T, [ -48 + 12*(T-2), -59 + 12*(T-2) ]\n\nSince -48 > -59, this would be [ larger + sΔT, smaller + sΔT], so the lower bound is h + sΔT = -59 + 12ΔT, upper bound τ + sΔT = -48 + 12ΔT, so it's from lower to upper.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h = -24, tail = 11, at T, [ -24 -36ΔT, 11 -36ΔT], and since -24 < 11, it's from lower to upper after decrease.\n\nSo in general, for any car, the span at time T can be computed as:\n\nLet ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 2\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T is [ h - s ΔT, tail - s ΔT ] but since h and tail may not be in order, we need the min and max.\n\nIn this case for left-moving, h = -24, tail = 11, both decrease, so lower bound min(-24,11) - sΔT? min(-24,11) is -24, max is 11, so at T, lower bound -24 -36ΔT, upper bound 11 -36ΔT.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, with τ and h, for the car (-48,-59,right,12), τ= -48, h= -59, at T, [ τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [ -48 +12ΔT, -59 +12ΔT], but -48 +12ΔT > -59 +12ΔT, so the lower bound is h + sΔT = -59 +12ΔT, upper bound τ + sΔT = -48 +12ΔT.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll define for each car the position at time T.\n\nFor a car, at turn t_1, the head and tail positions are given. For left-moving, head is at higher x, tail at lower x? In freeway 1, head h= -24, tail=11, but -24 < 11, so at x= -24 is one end, x=11 is the other, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head and tail: for (-48,-59,right,12), at t_1, head is at -59? But it's called head, but in the span for right-moving, it's [τ,h], with τ and h, and for this car, τ=-48, h=-59, so the tail is at τ=-48, head at h=-59, but -59 < -48, so head at lower x, tail at higher x? That seems odd.\n\nPerhaps the terms \"head\" and \"tail\" are relative to direction.\n\nFor left-moving, the head is the front when moving left, so for left-moving, head should be at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nIn freeway 1: (h, tail) = (-24,11) with direction left. -24 < 11, so if head is at -24 and tail at 11, but -24 is left of 11, so when moving left, the head at -24 is leading? If moving left, decreasing x, the car is oriented with head at the left end? I think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet's not worry about head and tail; let's just use the span as given.\n\nFor collision, we only care if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway we are on.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to know if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player is on a freeway y at turn T when we check for collision.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAnd when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, we are on y_T for collision check.\n\nAlso, note that if we move to a different y, we are not on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, the initial position is (0,0) at turn t_1=2, so y_2 = 0.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so y =9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. Only when on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid cars at x=0.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k for k=1 to 8, and for that k, if 0 is in some car's span, collision.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no collision.\n\nThe player starts at y=0, turn 2, and we need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nActions are taken at each turn, starting from turn t_1=2.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, but t is index, so actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for t=0, action at turn t_1, etc.\n\nLet's set T = turn number.\n\nStart at T=2, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} is set based on action at T.\n\nThe state at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T for y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and 0 in some car span on that freeway at T.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach some T where y_T =9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from T=2 to T=2+H-1, we take H actions: at T=2,3, ..., up to T=2+H-1, and after H actions, at turn (2+H-1)+1 = 2+H, y_{2+H} =9? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the start of turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T.\n\nThen we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy(a_T), clamped to [0,9].\n\nThen at turn T+1, we start from y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of turn T, based on y_T and car positions at T.\n\nFor turn T, if y_T in 1-8 and 0 in car span on freeway y_T at time T, collision.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to have at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, we reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have taken actions from T=2 to T=2+H-1, so we have y_2, y_3, ..., up to y_{2+H}.\n\nAfter action at T, we have y_{T+1}.\n\nSo after H actions, the last state is y_{2+H}.\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAnd we need to find H and actions such that for all turns from 2 to 2+H-1, no collision at those turns, since at turn 2+H, if y_{2+H}=9, it's safe, no car.\n\nCollision is only when on freeway 1-8 at turn T.\n\nAt turn T=2+H, if y=9, safe.\n\nBut during the path, for T from 2 to 2+H-1, if y_T in 1-8, must not have collision.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we need to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their spans over time.\n\nSet ΔT = T - 2, so at T=2, ΔT=0.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left-moving, h=-24, tail=11, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [ -24 - 36 ΔT, 11 - 36 ΔT ]\n\nSince -24 < 11, the lower bound is -24 -36ΔT, upper bound 11 -36ΔT.\n\n0 in span if lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper, so -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, left-moving, (-24,11,left,36), so same span as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)  // τ=-48, h=-59\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [ τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT ] but as per update, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nWith τ=-48, h=-59, s=12\n\nSo at T: [ -48 + 12 ΔT, -59 + 12 ΔT ] = [ -59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT ] since -59 +12ΔT < -48 +12ΔT\n\nLower bound: -59 +12ΔT, upper bound: -48 +12ΔT\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 12) // τ=36, h=25? 36>25, so τ=36, h=25, but for right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [36,25], but 36>25, so min 25, max 36, so [25,36] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [ τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [36 +12ΔT, 25 +12ΔT] = [25 +12ΔT, 36 +12ΔT] since 25<36\n\nSimilarly, third car: (0, -11, right, 12) // τ=0, h=-11, so at t_1: [τ, h] = [0, -11] = [-11,0] min -11 max 0\n\nAt T: [0 +12ΔT, -11 +12ΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, three cars identical.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (60, 49, right, 6) // τ=60, h=49, so at t_1: [τ, h] = [60,49] = [49,60]\n\nAt T: [60 +6ΔT, 49 +6ΔT] = [49 +6ΔT, 60 +6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (60,49,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car same as above: [49 +6ΔT, 60 +6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) // τ=12, h=1, so at t_1: [τ, h] = [12,1] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [12 +6ΔT, 1 +6ΔT] = [1 +6ΔT, 12 +6ΔT]\n\nNow, for each freeway, at each turn T, we need to know if there is any car where 0 is in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, we need to check all on that freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car, span [ -24 -36ΔT, 11 -36ΔT ]\n\n0 in span iff -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT\n\nSince -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 always for ΔT ≥0? -24 -36ΔT ≤0 for all ΔT ≥0, since -24≤0 and decreasing.\n\n-24 -36ΔT ≤0 is true for all ΔT, because it's negative.\n\n0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT, so 11 -36ΔT ≥0, so 11 ≥ 36ΔT, so ΔT ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only for ΔT=0, since ΔT integer, T=2 only.\n\nAt T=2, ΔT=0, 0 ≤11, true, so at T=2, 0 in span.\n\nFor ΔT≥1, 11-36ΔT ≤11-36=-25<0, so 0 ≤ -25 false, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, lower bound -24-36ΔT ≤0 always true.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in span only at T=2.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same as freeway 1, only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: span [ -59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span iff -59 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT\n\nWhich is -59 +12ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT\n\nSo 12ΔT ≤ 59 and 12ΔT ≥ 48\n\nSo ΔT ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT ≤4\n\nΔT ≥ 48/12 =4\n\nSo ΔT ≥4 and ΔT ≤4, so only at ΔT=4, T=6.\n\nAt T=6, ΔT=4, lower= -59+48= -11, upper= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nSecond car: span [25 +12ΔT, 36 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 25+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 36+12ΔT\n\nBut 25+12ΔT ≥25>0 for ΔT≥0, so 0 ≤ 25+12ΔT false, so never in span, since lower bound min 25.\n\nThird car: span [ -11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span iff -11 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nWhich is -11 +12ΔT ≤0 and 0 ≤12ΔT\n\nFirst: 12ΔT ≤11, ΔT≤11/12≈0.916, so ΔT=0\n\nSecond: 0≤12ΔT always for ΔT≥0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, lower= -11, upper=0, so 0 in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, at T=2 (ΔT=0), third car has 0 in span.\n\nAt T=6, first car has 0 in span.\n\nOther times, no car has 0 in span.\n\nAt T=2, ΔT=0, third car: [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=6, first car: [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 same as freeway 3, so they have cars at T=2 and T=6 with 0 occupied.\n\nFreeway 6: one car, span [49 +6ΔT, 60 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 49+6ΔT ≤0 ≤60+6ΔT\n\n49+6ΔT ≥49>0, so 0 ≤49+6ΔT false, never, since lower bound min 49>0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 same, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as freeway 6, [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT], never at 0.\n\nSecond car: [1 +6ΔT, 12 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span iff 1 +6ΔT ≤0 ≤12 +6ΔT\n\n1+6ΔT ≥1>0, so 0 ≤1+6ΔT false, never.\n\nSo freeway 8 never has a car at x=0.\n\nSummary of dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous only at T=2\n\n- y=2: dangerous only at T=2\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=2 and T=6\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=2 and T=6\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=2 and T=6\n\n- y=6: never dangerous\n\n- y=7: never dangerous\n\n- y=8: never dangerous\n\ny=6,7,8 are always safe, no cars at x=0.\n\ny=1 and 2 only dangerous at T=2.\n\ny=3,4,5 dangerous at T=2 and T=6.\n\nNow, player starts at T=2, y=0.\n\nAt T=2, if we are on y=1,2,3,4,5, we would collide, but we start at y=0, so at T=2, we are safe.\n\nWe need to choose actions starting from T=2.\n\nAction at T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy: U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, check collision.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, we cannot be on y=1 or 2 at T=2, but at T=2 we are at y=0, so not on those.\n\nNow, for T=2, we are safe.\n\nWe take action at T=2 to go to y_{3}.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=2 and T=6, but T=2 is past, so for future, avoid T=6 on y=3,4,5.\n\nAlso, y=1 and 2 are only dangerous at T=2, which is over, so for T>2, y=1 and 2 are always safe, since no other dangerous times.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 always safe.\n\ny=3,4,5 dangerous only at T=6.\n\nNow, T=6 corresponds to ΔT=4, T=2+4=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: from y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 moves up, but we can move faster or slower.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 up moves, but we can have extra moves with stay or down, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, we should only go up, no down or stay, so H=9, from T=2 to T=10, y from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nWith only up moves, the path would be:\n\nAt T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nAction U at T=2, then y_3 = 0+1 =1\n\nAt T=3, y=1, now is it safe? For y=1, dangerous only at T=2, not at T=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, action U at T=3, y_4=2\n\nAt T=4, y=2, dangerous only at T=2, not T=4, safe.\n\nAction U at T=4, y_5=3\n\nAt T=5, y=3, dangerous at T=2 and T=6. T=5 not dangerous, so safe.\n\nAction U at T=5, y_6=4\n\nAt T=6, y=4, now T=6, and y=4 is dangerous at T=6, so collision!\n\ny=4 at T=6 is dangerous, since freeway 4 has car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue up.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=6, we are at y=4, which is dangerous.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=6.\n\nT=6 is turn 6.\n\nIn the sequence above, we reach y=4 at T=5? Let's list turns:\n\nT | y_T | after action\n\nStart T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_2: say U, then y_3=1\n\nT=3, y=1, safe (since not dangerous time)\n\nAction a_3: U, y_4=2\n\nT=4, y=2, safe\n\nAction a_4: U, y_5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, is it safe? For y=3, dangerous at T=2 and T=6, not T=5, so safe.\n\nAction a_5: U, y_6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, dangerous at T=6, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at T=5, we don't go up, but stay or down, but that might delay.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, we can be there any time.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=3,4,5.\n\nThe problem is only at T=6 for y=3,4,5.\n\nT=6 is a specific turn.\n\nWe can either avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=6, or be there but not collide, but at T=6, for y=3,4,5, there is collision, so we must not be on y=3,4,5 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, it's safe.\n\nSo we need to ensure that at turn T=6, we are not on y=3,4, or 5.\n\nThat is, y_6 not in {3,4,5}.\n\nNow, the player position at each turn depends on actions.\n\nWe start at T=2, y=0.\n\nAfter actions, y at each turn.\n\nWe need y_T for T from 2 to some end.\n\nSpecifically for T=6, y_6 not in {3,4,5}.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWith only up moves, we can reach y=9 at T=11: let's see.\n\nT=2: y=0\n\na2=U, T=3: y=1\n\na3=U, T=4: y=2\n\na4=U, T=5: y=3\n\na5=U, T=6: y=4 → collision if we go up, but we need to avoid.\n\na5 not U, or slow down.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=2, then stay or something.\n\nList possible y at T=6.\n\ny_6 can be from 0 to 9, depending on actions from T=2 to T=5 (4 actions).\n\nActions from T=2 to T=5 determine y_6.\n\nAt T=2, we take action a2, then y3 = y2 + Δy(a2) = 0 + Δy\n\nSimilarly, a3, y4 = y3 + Δy(a3)\n\na4, y5 = y4 + Δy(a4)\n\na5, y6 = y5 + Δy(a5)\n\ny2=0\n\nAfter a2, y3 = 0 + Δy2, where Δy2 in {-1,0,1}\n\nSimilarly, y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nWe need y6 not in {3,4,5} to avoid collision at T=6.\n\nThen after that, we can go up to 9.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible except at critical points.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and from y=0, with min 9 up moves.\n\nBut we have to spend some turns not going up to avoid T=6 on bad y.\n\nSpecifically, at T=6, we need y6 <=2 or y6 >=6.\n\ny6 <=2 means we are behind, y6 >=6 means we are ahead.\n\ny6=6,7,8 are safe, y=9 not freeway, but y=6 is freeway but always safe.\n\ny=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, if we can reach y=6 by T=6, then we are safe at T=6.\n\nThen from there go up to 9.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=2 at T=6, we can go up later.\n\nBut to minimize H, better to be ahead.\n\nLet's see the earliest we can reach high y.\n\nStart T=2, y=0\n\nAfter one move: T=3, y can be 0 (S), 1 (U), or -1 but y min 0, so 0 or 1.\n\nIf D, y= max(0,0-1)=0, so y3 can be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, T=4, y can be from 0 to 2, and so on.\n\nTo reach high y fast, we should always go up if possible.\n\nBut at some points we may need to not go up to avoid position.\n\nSpecifically for T=6.\n\nNow, let's find y at T=6 with min actions to y=9.\n\nFirst, without constraint, min turns to y=9: 9 up moves, from T=2 to T=10, y from 0 to 9, with y_T for T=2 to 10: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nAt T=6, y=4, which is bad.\n\nWe need to change so that y6 not 4.\n\nOptions: either slow down before T=6 or speed up.\n\nIf we slow down, e.g., stay at some point, then y6 lower.\n\nIf we speed up, but we start from y=0, max we can be at T=3: y=1, T=4: y=2, T=5: y=3, T=6: y=4 if we go up, but y=4 is bad, so we cannot reach y=5 or 6 at T=6? Let's see.\n\nMax y at T=6: from T=2 to T=5, 4 actions, all U, y3=1, y4=2, y5=3, y6=4. Cannot be higher than 4 at T=6 with 4 actions? Actions from T=2 to T=5: 4 actions, each can increase y by 1, so max y6=0 +4 =4.\n\nSimilarly, min y6=0 if all S or D, but y min 0.\n\nSo y6 can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut we need y6 not in {3,4,5}, but y6<=4, so not 5, so we need y6 not 3 or 4, so y6 <=2 or y6=4 but not, y6<=4, so must have y6 <=2.\n\ny6 must be 0,1, or 2 to avoid collision at T=6.\n\ny6 cannot be 3 or 4.\n\nSince y6 max 4, so y6 must be 0,1,2.\n\nThat means we must be behind at T=6, not beyond y=2.\n\nThen after T=6, we need to go up to 9, which takes at least 7 more moves (from y<=2 to y=9, difference 7 to 9, so 7 up moves).\n\nBut with possible stays or downs, but to min time, all up.\n\nNow, y6 <=2, say y6=2.\n\nThen from T=6 to T=6+7=13, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt T=6, y=2, safe since not dangerous.\n\nThen actions: a6=U, T=7 y=3\n\na7=U, T=8 y=4\n\na8=U, T=9 y=5\n\na9=U, T=10 y=6\n\na10=U, T=11 y=7\n\na11=U, T=12 y=8\n\na12=U, T=13 y=9\n\nSo at T=13, y=9.\n\nTotal turns from start: from T=2 to T=13, so H=12 actions? Let's see.\n\nWe take actions from T=2 to T=12, that is 11 actions? Define H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so we take H actions: at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nHere t_1=2, actions at T=2,3,4,..., up to T=2+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn (2+H-1)+1 = 2+H, y_{2+H}.\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nIn the above, if we have y6=2 at T=6, then we go up each turn to y13=9.\n\ny13 means after action at T=12, y13=9.\n\nT=13 is the turn when y=9.\n\nNow, actions taken: from T=2 to T=12, that is 11 actions? T=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12: 11 actions.\n\nH=11, then y_{2+11} = y13=9.\n\nBut we have y6=2.\n\nNow, to have y6<=2, we need to slow down in the first few turns.\n\nFor example, from T=2 to T=5, we have 4 actions to set y6.\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5, but y5 depends on previous.\n\ny2=0\n\nAfter a2: y3 = 0 + Δy2\n\nAfter a3: y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nAfter a4: y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nAfter a5: y6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, y clamped, but since we start low, probably no issue.\n\nWe need y6 <=2.\n\nWith min slowing down.\n\nSince we need to go up later, better not to go down, so use S or U but not D, to save moves.\n\nBut S wastes a move, D also wastes or worse.\n\nTo have y6 low, we can use S or D in some actions.\n\nBut to minimize total H, we should use as few non-up as possible to make y6<=2.\n\nMax y6 can be is 4 with all U.\n\nWe need y6<=2, so we need to reduce by at least 2, meaning at least two non-up moves in the first 4 actions? Actions from T=2 to T=5 affect y6.\n\nEach action: if U, y increases by 1; if S, y same; if D, y decreases by 1, but y min 0.\n\nNumber of up moves determines y.\n\nLet k be the number of U actions from T=2 to T=5.\n\nThere are 4 actions: a2 to a5.\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\ny5 depends on a2 to a4.\n\ny2=0\n\nAfter a2: if U, y3=1; if S, y3=0; if D, y3=0\n\nSimilarly, after a3: y4 = y3 + Δy3, etc.\n\nBut y6 = initial + sum of Δy from t=2 to t=5, since each action changes y for the next state.\n\ny3 = y2 + Δy2\n\ny4 = y3 + Δy3 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\n...\n\ny6 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nSince y2=0, y6 = sum_{i=2 to 5} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i in {-1,0,1}\n\ny6 = number of U minus number of D from i=2 to 5, since S contributes 0.\n\nNumber of actions from T=2 to T=5: four actions.\n\nLet U_count, S_count, D_count for these four actions.\n\nU_count + S_count + D_count = 4\n\ny6 = U_count - D_count\n\nSince y6 <=2, and U_count - D_count <=2\n\nAlso, y6 >=0.\n\nWe want to minimize total actions to y=9.\n\nAfter T=6, we need to go from y6 to 9, which requires at least 9 - y6 up moves.\n\nSince y6 <=2, 9 - y6 >=7, so at least 7 up moves needed after T=5? After action at T=5, we have y6.\n\nThen from T=6 onwards, we take actions to increase y to 9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so we need (9 - y6) up moves, and possibly some S or D, but to min time, only U, so number of actions from T=6 to T=6 + (9 - y6) -1? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1}.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T_end.\n\nFrom turn T_start, y_start, to y_end=9.\n\nThe min number of actions is at least the difference, but since we move step by step.\n\nFrom y6 at T=6, we want to reach y=9 at some later turn.\n\nMin actions: if we do all U, y increases by 1 per action.\n\nAfter k actions all U, y_{6+k} = y6 + k\n\nSet y_{6+k} =9, so k = 9 - y6\n\nThen turn when y=9 is T=6 + k = 6 + (9 - y6) = 15 - y6\n\nSince y_{6+k} = y6 + k =9.\n\nActions from T=6 to T=6 + k -1, that is k actions.\n\nThen total actions from start: actions from T=2 to T=5: 4 actions, plus actions from T=6 to T=6+k-1: k actions.\n\nTotal H actions: from T=2 to T=2+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{2+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, we have actions up to T=6 + k -1, and y_{6+k} =9.\n\nSet T_end = 6 + k, y_{T_end} =9.\n\nT_end = 2 + H, so 2 + H = 6 + k, so H = 4 + k\n\nSince k = 9 - y6\n\nSo H = 4 + (9 - y6) = 13 - y6\n\nTo minimize H, we need to maximize y6, since H=13 - y6.\n\nBut y6 <=2, so max y6=2, then min H=13-2=11.\n\nIf y6=2, H=11.\n\nIf y6=1, H=12, worse.\n\ny6=0, H=13, worse.\n\nSo best to have y6=2, then H=11.\n\nNow, with y6=2.\n\ny6=2, so sum Δy from T=2 to T=5 must be 2.\n\nSince y6 = sum_{i=2 to 5} Δy_i =2.\n\nEach Δy_i in {-1,0,1}, so we need exactly two U and two S, or three U and one D, etc., but since y>=0, and we start from 0.\n\ny6= U_count - D_count =2 for the four actions.\n\nAlso, since y must be non-negative.\n\nNow, to have y6=2 with min non-up moves, but since we need y6=2, and max is 4, we need to have fewer U or more D, but we want y6 high to min H, so y6=2 is best.\n\nNow, possible ways: for example, three U and one D, then U_count - D_count =3-1=2.\n\nOr two U and two S, U_count - D_count=2-0=2.\n\nOr one U, three S, but U-D=1-0=1<2, not enough.\n\nOr four U and two D, but only four actions, impossible.\n\nSo possibilities: (3U,1D) or (2U,2S) or (2U,1S,1D) but U-D=2-1=1 if one D, not 2.\n\nU_count - D_count=2.\n\nCases:\n\n- 3U, 1D: then U-D=3-1=2\n\n- 2U, 2S: U-D=2-0=2\n\n- 4U, but U-D=4-0=4>2, too high\n\n- 1U, 3S: U-D=1-0=1<2\n\n- 2U, 1S, 1D: U-D=2-1=1<2\n\n- 1U, 2S, 1D: U-D=1-1=0\n\n- 0U, 4S: 0\n\n- etc. all less than 2 except the first two with U-D=2.\n\nSo only two cases: either three U and one D, or two U and two S.\n\nIn both cases, we have y6=2.\n\nNow, we need to check if during the path, no collision, except we avoid T=6 on bad y.\n\nIn this case, for T<6, we are at lower y, and since dangerous times are only T=2 and T=6 for y=3,4,5, and T=2 is past, and for y=1,2 only dangerous at T=2, so for T>2, no danger on y=1,2.\n\ny=1 and 2 are safe for T>2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, we are at y6=2, which is safe.\n\nNow, for T=3,4,5, y could be low.\n\nFor example, if we do three U and one D, we might have y=0 or negative, but y min 0.\n\nSimilarly with two U and two S.\n\nWe need to ensure that at each turn T=3,4,5, if y_T in 1-8, no collision, but since only y=3,4,5 have possible danger at T=6, but not at other times, and y=1,2 safe after T=2, so for T=3,4,5, all y positions are safe, because:\n\n- If on y=1 or 2, safe for T>2\n\n- If on y=3,4,5, dangerous only at T=2 and T=6, not at T=3,4,5\n\n- y=6,7,8 always safe\n\n- y=0 and 9 safe\n\nSo for turns T=3,4,5, no matter what y, it is safe, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, if we are not on y=3,4,5, safe.\n\nThen after, all safe.\n\nSo we don't need to worry about collision during T=3,4,5.\n\nNow, we need to have y6=2.\n\nThen from there, all U to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we have H=11 as above.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nEarlier I thought y6 cannot be higher than 4, and must be <=2, so y6=2 is best.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=6 or higher at T=6?\n\nBut with actions from T=2 to T=5, only 4 actions, max y6=4, as y6 = number of U from T=2 to T=5.\n\ny6 = sum Δy from T=2 to T=5, each Δy <=1, so y6 <=4.\n\nCannot be 5 or 6.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at T=6.\n\nThus, y6=2 is best possible, with H=11.\n\nNow, we need a sequence.\n\nFirst, to have y6=2.\n\nWe can use either:\n\nOption 1: three U and one D in actions a2,a3,a4,a5.\n\nBut with one D, we might go below 0, but y min 0.\n\nOption 2: two U and two S.\n\nIn option 2, no down move, better.\n\nWith two U and two S, we have y6=2.\n\nSimilarly, with three U and one D, also y6=2, but D might cause y to decrease, but since we start from 0, and go down, y=0, no problem.\n\nBut using S is better than D, since D doesn't help progress.\n\nIn terms of position, with S we stay, with D we go down, but since we need to go up later, better to use S to not lose progress.\n\nIn both cases, we reach y6=2.\n\nBut with two U and two S, we might be at higher y during, but not necessary.\n\nNow, let's list a sequence.\n\nFirst, with two U and two S.\n\nActions a2 to a5: two U and two S.\n\nFor example, we can do U at some points.\n\nAlso, at T=2, we start.\n\nWe need to specify the actions.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, we should go up as soon as possible, but with constraints.\n\nSince T=3,4,5 are all safe, we can go up freely except we need to have only two U in the first four actions? Actions a2,a3,a4,a5.\n\na2 at T=2, a3 at T=3, a4 at T=4, a5 at T=5.\n\nAfter a5, y6 is set.\n\ny6 depends on a2 to a5.\n\nWe need exactly two U in a2 to a5 for the S option.\n\nSimilarly, positions:\n\nSet t=0 for simplicity, but turn starts at 2.\n\nList turns:\n\nT=2: y=0, safe. We take action a2.\n\nSuppose we take S or D to not go up, but we need some U.\n\nTo have y6=2 with two U and two S.\n\nFor example:\n\nSequence 1:\n\na2 = S: then y3 = 0 + 0 =0 (since S)\n\nT=3: y=0, safe (y=0 not freeway)\n\nAction a3 = U: y4 = 0 +1 =1\n\nT=4: y=1, safe (since T>2)\n\nAction a4 = U: y5 =1 +1=2\n\nT=5: y=2, safe\n\nAction a5 = S: y6 =2 +0=2\n\nT=6: y=2, safe (not 3,4,5)\n\nNow, from here, all U:\n\na6 = U: y7 =2+1=3\n\nT=7: y=3, now at T=7, not T=6, so safe (danger only T=2 and T=6 for y=3)\n\na7 = U: y8=4\n\nT=8: y=4, safe (only danger T=2 and T=6)\n\na8 = U: y9=5\n\nT=9: y=5, safe\n\na9 = U: y10=6\n\nT=10: y=6, safe (always)\n\na10 = U: y11=7\n\nT=11: y=7, safe\n\na11 = U: y12=8\n\nT=12: y=8, safe\n\na12 = U: y13=9\n\nT=13: y=9, done.\n\nActions from T=2 to T=12: a2 to a12, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nWith three U and one D:\n\nFor example:\n\na2 = U: y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1, safe\n\na3 = U: y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2, safe\n\na4 = U: y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, safe\n\na5 = D: y6=3-1=2\n\nT=6: y=2, safe\n\nThen same as above, a6 to a12 U, y to 9 at T=13.\n\nBut here we used D, which is worse, we went to y=3 and down, but same end.\n\nIn the first sequence with S, we stayed lower.\n\nBut H same.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 before T=13?\n\nWith y6=2, min turn to y=9 is T=13, as above.\n\nIf we can be at y=6 at T=6, but impossible, since y6<=4.\n\nPerhaps we can take a different path, like go to y=6 earlier or something, but since y=6 is always safe, but we cannot reach before T=6 with high y.\n\nFor example, at T=6, max y=4, but y=4 at T=6 is bad, so we cannot be there.\n\nIf we go to y=5 or 6 at T=7, but after T=6, it is safe.\n\nBut with min actions.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible but skip T=6 on y=3,4,5.\n\nFor example, at T=5, if we are at y=2, then we could go to y=3 at T=6, but y=3 at T=6 bad.\n\nSo we must not go to y=3,4,5 at T=6.\n\nIf at T=5, we are at y=5, then at T=6, if we go up, y6=6, safe; or stay y6=5, bad; or down y6=4, bad.\n\nBut can we be at y=5 at T=5?\n\ny5: with actions from T=2 to T=4, three actions.\n\ny5 = sum Δy from T=2 to T=4.\n\nMax y5 =3, with three U.\n\ny5=3 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action a5: if we go U, y6=4, but T=6 y=4 bad.\n\nIf we go S, y6=3, bad.\n\nIf we go D, y6=2, safe.\n\nThen we have y6=2, same as before.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut y5=3, which is higher than previous sequences, but then we go down to y6=2, so net same as having y5=2 with no down.\n\nIn terms of total, same H.\n\nIf at T=5, y=3, and we could go directly to y=6, but we cannot, since one action only change by 1.\n\nUnless we do something else.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6,7,8 always safe, we can go there and stay, but to min time, no need.\n\nBut at T=6, if we can be on y=6, we avoid.\n\nBut impossible.\n\nPerhaps we start later, but no.\n\nAnother thought: the collision at T=6 is only for that instant, but since we must not be there, no choice.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=3,4,5 at T=6 but not collide, but at T=6, for those freeways, there is car at x=0, so we collide if on that freeway.\n\nSo must avoid.\n\nTherefore, min H=11 with y6=2.\n\nNow, with the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions starting from t_1=2.\n\nWith two U and two S in the first four actions.\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\na2 = S\n\na3 = U\n\na4 = U\n\na5 = S\n\nThen a6 to a12 U\n\nBut a12 is at T=12, y13=9.\n\nActions: a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12: 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nWe can place the S differently.\n\nFor example, to be higher earlier, but not necessary.\n\nSince from T=3 to T=5, all positions safe, we can go up.\n\nFor example:\n\na2 = U: y3=1\n\nT=3: safe\n\na3 = U: y4=2\n\nT=4: safe\n\na4 = S: y5=2 +0=2? After a4 at T=4, y5.\n\ny4=2, a4=S, then y5=2\n\nT=5: y=2, safe\n\na5 = S: y6=2\n\nT=6: y=2, safe\n\nThen same.\n\nOr a4=U, but y4=2, a4=U, y5=3, then a5 must be S or D to have y6=2 or less.\n\nIf y5=3, a5=S, y6=3, bad; a5=D, y6=2, good.\n\nBut then we used D.\n\nWith a5=S and y5=3 not good.\n\nSo better to have y5=2 or less.\n\nIn the first sequence with a2=S, we have y3=0, which is fine.\n\nTo avoid being too low, but y=0 safe.\n\nAnother sequence: all actions possible.\n\nBut I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nStart T=2, y=0\n\nAction a2=S: y3=0\n\nT=3: y=0, safe\n\nAction a3=U: y4=1\n\nT=4: y=1, safe\n\nAction a4=U: y5=2\n\nT=5: y=2, safe\n\nAction a5=S: y6=2\n\nT=6: y=2, safe\n\nAction a6=U: y7=3\n\nT=7: y=3, safe (since T=7 !=6)\n\nAction a7=U: y8=4\n\nT=8: y=4, safe\n\nAction a8=U: y9=5\n\nT=9: y=5, safe\n\nAction a9=U: y10=6\n\nT=10: y=6, safe\n\nAction a10=U: y11=7\n\nT=11: y=7, safe\n\nAction a11=U: y12=8\n\nT=12: y=8, safe\n\nAction a12=U: y13=9\n\nT=13: y=9, reached.\n\nActions from T=2 to T=12, 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, a12 at T=12 leads to y13=9.\n\nThe actions are a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, here t_1=2, H=11, so actions at T=2 to T=12.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nAfter a12=U, y13=9.\n\nIn the sequence, a6 to a12 are all U, that's 7 U from T=6 to T=12.\n\nT=6 to T=12: 7 actions, from y6=2 to y13=9, yes.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we use three U and one D.\n\nFor example:\n\na2=U: y3=1\n\na3=U: y4=2\n\na4=U: y5=3\n\na5=D: y6=3-1=2 (since y min, but 3-1=2)\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut with a5=D, we went to y=3 and down, whereas with S we stayed at y=2, but same y6.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we go faster after, but no, since y6=2, min to y=9 is 7 moves.\n\nAnother idea: at T=6, if we are at y=2, we go up, but perhaps we can be at higher y at T=6 by going down earlier or something, but no.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 safe, we could go directly, but we start from low.\n\nPerhaps from beginning, go up to y=2 quickly, then stay until T=6, then go.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nI think H=11 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's check if we can have y6=2 with only three actions or something, but no, four actions needed to set y6.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before T=13 if we start going up earlier, but we have to delay because of T=6.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=5 at T=6, but cannot, or at T=7.\n\nAt T=5, y=3 max, as above.\n\nAfter T=6, we can go fast.\n\nBut from y6=2 to y=9, min 7 turns.\n\nUnless we can be at y=6 at T=6, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I missed a freeway.\n\ny=6 is always safe, and we can reach it.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at T=6, we need y6=6, which requires sum Δy from T=2 to T=5 =6, but with 4 actions, max sum Δy=4, so y6<=4, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 8, there was a car (12,1,right,6), but we saw it never at x=0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIn the sequence, with two S and two U in first four actions.\n\nIn my sequence: a2=S, a3=U, a4=U, a5=S\n\nThen a6 to a12 U.\n\nBut a12 is the 11th action? Actions: index from 0 to 10 for H=11.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=2, so actions at T=2 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=11, t from 0 to 10, actions at T=2 to 12.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can place the S differently, but need to have exactly two U in a2 to a5.\n\nFor example, we can do U at T=2 and T=3, then S at T=4 and T=5.\n\na2=U: y3=1\n\na3=U: y4=2\n\na4=S: y5=2\n\na5=S: y6=2\n\nThen same.\n\nOr a2=U, a3=S, a4=U, a5=S: y3=1, y4=1 (a3=S), y5=2 (a4=U), y6=2 (a5=S)\n\nAll fine.\n\nI think any is ok.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nIn the sequence, after that, all U.\n\nBut in the action list.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, at T=2, we take action.\n\nIn the sequence I have a2=S, but we could take other actions.\n\nBut to min time, we should go up when possible, but we need to have only two U in first four, so we have to have two non-U.\n\nIn the sequence with a2=U, a3=U, a4=S, a5=S, we go up to y=2 at T=4, then stay until T=6.\n\nThen go up.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nBut in the car, for freeway 3,4,5, at T=6, there is car, but we avoid.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nTurn 2: U  (a2=U)\n\nTurn 3: U  (a3=U)\n\nTurn 4: S  (a4=S)\n\nTurn 5: S  (a5=S)  // now y6=2\n\nTurn 6: U  (a6=U)  // y7=3\n\nTurn 7: U  (a7=U)  // y8=4\n\nTurn 8: U  (a8=U)  // y9=5\n\nTurn 9: U  (a9=U)  // y10=6\n\nTurn 10: U  (a10=U) // y11=7\n\nTurn 11: U  (a11=U) // y12=8\n\nTurn 12: U  (a12=U) // y13=9\n\nActions from Turn 2 to Turn 12.\n\nIn the output, it should be listed.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut is this minimal? H=11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can save one turn.\n\nSuppose at T=5, we are at y=3, then a5=D to y6=2, then from y6=2, we need 7 up to y=9 at T=13, same.\n\nAfter T=6, since no danger, we can go directly.\n\nBut y=3 at T=7 is safe, etc.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6,7,8 always safe, we could go to y=6 as soon as possible, but we cannot before T=6.\n\nAt T=6, we are at y=2, then to y=6, we need 4 up moves, at T=10 y=6, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps we start by going up to y=1 or 2, then at T=6, we are at y=2, same.\n\nI think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nFrom start, to avoid T=6 on y=3-5, we must have y6<=2.\n\nThen from y<=2 to y=9, min 7 actions: after 7 up, y increases by 7, so from y=2 to y=9 in 7 moves.\n\nNumber of actions: to set y6, we used 4 actions (a2 to a5), but with y6=2, which is less than the max 4, so we \"wasted\" 2 actions in the sense of not progressing, but we have to.\n\nThe minimal possible: if we could be at y=9 at T=11, for example, but from T=2 to T=11, 9 turns, but with y=0 to9 in 9 steps, but at T=6 we would be at y=4, which is bad, and we cannot skip, so we must have a delay.\n\nThe delay is at least 2 turns (since we need y6=2 instead of 4, so 2 less, meaning 2 turns not up).\n\nThus, minimal H=9 + 2 =11, yes.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.\n\nNow for the output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at turn \\(T = 6\\), where collisions would occur due to cars spanning \\(x = 0\\). Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are only dangerous at \\(T = 2\\), which is avoided since the player starts at \\(y = 0\\). Freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are always safe.\n\nTo achieve \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns, the player must reach \\(y = 2\\) by turn \\(T = 6\\) (i.e., \\(y_6 = 2\\)) to avoid the dangerous freeways at \\(T = 6\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) at turn t1 = 3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T and for that y, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, you move from y to y+1, you're still on y for collision purposes at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=3, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -60, tail -25, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, the span moves left over time. At turn T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] with t1=3.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span is [h, τ] at t1, and at T, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. Since it's moving left, the head is more negative, so h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] at t1, becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] at T.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Head and tail: for left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so head should be greater than tail if we think of position increasing to the right. But in the coordinate, x=0 is where the player crosses, so left-moving cars have decreasing x.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the span properly.\n\nFor a left-moving car: at t1, head position h, tail position τ, with h > τ since head is to the right of tail when moving left? No.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its head is the leading part in the direction of movement. So if moving left, head has higher x-value at start, and decreases.\n\nIn the input: for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36). So head -60, tail -25. -60 is less than -25, so if x increases to the right, head is at -60, tail at -25, so tail is to the right of head? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I have the coordinate system wrong.\n\nAssume x-axis: left is negative, right is positive. So moving left means decreasing x.\n\nFor a car moving left, the head is the front, so it should have a higher x-value initially, but as it moves left, x decreases.\n\nBut here, head is -60, tail is -25. -60 < -25, so head is left of tail? That might be inconsistent.\n\nLook at the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1, span is [h, τ], which for freeway 1 is [-60, -25]. So from x=-60 to x=-25, but since head is -60 and tail is -25, and it's moving left, so decreasing x, so at T, it shifts left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so for example, freeway 3 has ( -36, -47, right, 12), so τ = -47, h = -36? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head should be the front when moving right.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at freeway 3: cars are listed as (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nFor the first one: head -36, tail -47. Since moving right, head should be to the right, so -36 > -47, so head at -36, tail at -47, so at t1, span is from tail to head? But the update says for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so τ to h.\n\nIn this case, for (-36, -47, right, 12), τ = -47, h = -36? But it says head and tail, so head is -36, tail is -47, so τ = tail = -47, h = head = -36.\n\nThen span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36] for the car.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1, head -60, tail -25, span at t1 is [h, τ] = [-60, -25].\n\nNow for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T if y_T = y, and collision if for that y, there is a car with 0 in span(T).\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t1=3, position y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H should be at least 8, since from y=1 to y=9, need to increase by 8, and each U move increases by 1, so with only U, it would take 8 turns, but might have collisions or need to wait.\n\nWith D or S, it might take longer, so minimal H is at least 8.\n\nBut due to cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes, so H could be more than 8.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate the car positions over time.\n\nt1 = 3.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 3 for turn T.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need to know when 0 is in the car's span for that freeway.\n\nSince collision depends on the freeway and the turn, and player is on that freeway only if y_T = k for freeway k.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each freeway, I have multiple cars, so I need to find for which turns T, there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at T.\n\nThen, the player must not be on that freeway at that turn, meaning y_T != k for that k and T.\n\nBut y_T is the position at turn T, before the action, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position y_T.\n\nThen, action a_T is taken, which determines Δy, and y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, position is y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nFor the player to be safe at turn T, if y_T = k (freeway 1 to 8), then for that k, 0 should not be in any car's span on freeway k at turn T.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision, but y=9 is the goal, so when we reach y=9, we stop.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need the set of turns T where it is occupied at x=0, meaning some car has 0 in span.\n\nSince turns are discrete, I can find for each freeway the times when it is blocked.\n\nLet me define for each freeway k, the set of T where 0 is in some car's span for k.\n\nThen, for the player path, for each turn T from t1 onwards, y_T must not be in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} if k is blocked at T, or if not blocked, it's ok.\n\nBut y_T is the position at the start of turn T.\n\nLet's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (head h=-60, tail τ=-25, dir left, speed s=36)\n\nSpan at T: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-60 - 36ΔT, -25 - 36ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [ -60 -36ΔT, -25 -36ΔT]\n\nSo -60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is decreasing.\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 => -36ΔT ≤ 60 => ΔT ≥ -60/36? No:\n\n-60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 => -36ΔT ≤ 60, divide by -36, inequality flips, so ΔT ≥ -60/36? Let's keep integers.\n\n-60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 => -36ΔT ≤ 60 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36ΔT ≥ -60, so ΔT ≥ -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, but since ΔT ≥0, this is always true for ΔT≥0? No.\n\nΔT = T - 3, T ≥ 3, so ΔT ≥0.\n\n-60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 is true when -36ΔT ≤ 60, so ΔT ≥ -60/36 = -5/3, which is about -1.666, and since ΔT ≥0 > -1.666, this inequality is always true for ΔT ≥0.\n\nThen the second part: 0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT => 25 + 36ΔT ≤ 0? No:\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT => add 25 to both sides: 25 ≤ -36ΔT\n\nThen, since -36ΔT is negative, 25 ≤ negative number? Impossible.\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT\n\nBut -25 -36ΔT is always negative for ΔT ≥0, so 0 ≤ negative is false.\n\nThus, for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span because the span is from a negative number to a less negative, but both negative, so x from say -60-36ΔT to -25-36ΔT, which for ΔT≥0, left end is more negative, right end is -25-36ΔT ≤ -25 <0, so all x<0, so 0 is never in the span. So freeway 1 is never blocked at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36), identical, so also never blocked.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 12)  // head -36, tail -47? But for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nDirection right, so at T, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 12ΔT, -36 + 12ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [-47 +12ΔT, -36 +12ΔT]\n\nSo -47 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -47 +12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 47 => ΔT ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT ≤ 3 since integer.\n\nΔT integer, T integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -36 +12ΔT => 36 ≤ 12ΔT => ΔT ≥ 36/12 = 3\n\nSo for ΔT=3, both: -47+36 = -11 ≤0, 0≤ -36+36=0, yes 0≤0.\n\nΔT=3: lower bound -47+36= -11 ≤0, upper bound -36+36=0 ≤0? 0 ≤0 is true, but 0 is included.\n\nSpan at ΔT=3: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=2: -47+24= -23 ≤0, -36+24= -12, 0 ≤ -12? false, so not.\n\nΔT=4: -47+48=1, 1≤0? false, so only ΔT=3.\n\nSo at ΔT=3, T= t1 + ΔT =3+3=6, span includes 0.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12) // head 48, tail 37, dir right, speed 12\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [37, 48] since right-moving? τ is tail, h head.\n\nIn input, it's (head, tail), so for this car, head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nSo τ=tail=37, h=head=48.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nBut 37+12ΔT ≥37>0 for ΔT≥0, so always positive, 0 never in, so no issue.\n\nThird car: (12, 1, right, 12) // head=12, tail=1, dir right\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1+12ΔT, 12+12ΔT] ≥1>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the first car blocks at T=6 (since ΔT=3, T=3+3=6)\n\nAt T=6, y=3 is blocked if player is on it.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 3, so same blocking: only at T=6 for the first car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 3 and 4, so also blocked only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car: (-48, -59, right, 6) // head=-48, tail=-59? dir right\n\nInput: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nSo head=-48, tail=-59, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [ -59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\nSo -59 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so ΔT ≤9\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +6ΔT => 48 ≤ 6ΔT => ΔT ≥ 48/6 =8\n\nSo for ΔT=8,9\n\nΔT=8: lower -59+48= -11 ≤0, upper -48+48=0 ≤0? 0≤0 true\n\nΔT=9: lower -59+54= -5 ≤0, upper -48+54=6, 0≤6 true.\n\nSo at T=3+8=11 and T=3+9=12, freeway 6 blocked.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car: (-48, -59, right, 6) same as freeway 6, so blocked at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 6) same as above.\n\nSecond car: (18, 7, right, 6) // head=18, tail=7, dir right, speed 6\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7+6ΔT, 18+6ΔT] ≥7>0, so 0 never in span, no block.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car matters: (-48,-59,right,6), same as before, blocked at T=11 and 12.\n\nSummary of blocked freeways:\n\n- Freeway 1: never blocked\n\n- Freeway 2: never blocked\n\n- Freeway 3: blocked at T=6\n\n- Freeway 4: blocked at T=6\n\n- Freeway 5: blocked at T=6\n\n- Freeway 6: blocked at T=11 and 12\n\n- Freeway 7: blocked at T=11 and 12\n\n- Freeway 8: blocked at T=11 and 12\n\nNow, player starts at turn t1=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nEach turn, we choose action, which changes y for next turn.\n\nSince we want minimal H, probably we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on blocked freeways at wrong times.\n\ny_T is position at turn T.\n\nStart: T=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to find sequence of actions from T=3 to T=3+H-1, such that after H turns, y_{3+H-1} =9, I think.\n\nLet the turns be T=3,4,5,... up to some T_end.\n\nAt each turn T, we are at y_T, then we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAfter action at T, we have y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position after H actions: after turn T=3+H-1, we have taken H actions, and y_{3+H} is set, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nTurn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=3, so at turn 3 + H -1 = turn 2+H.\n\nAnd position at that turn is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nStart at turn t1=3, position y_{t1} = y_3 =1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} = a_3, y_4 is set.\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}=a_4, y_5, and so on, up to after a_{t1+H-1} = a_{3+H-1}, y_{3+H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1 = 2 + H.\n\nAt turn 2+H, position y_{2+H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, turn t1 +1 -1 = t1=3, so y_3=9, but start y_3=1, not 9, so H>1.\n\nGenerally, at turn T = t1 + t for t=0 to H-1? The actions are for t from 0 to H-1, so turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nPosition at turn t1 is given, then after actions at these turns, position at turn t1 + H -1 is set to 9? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t=0, action at t1 +0 = t1, which affects y_{t1+1}\n\nFor t=1, action at t1+1, affects y_{t1+2}, ..., up to t=H-1, action at t1 + H -1, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1} is before the action at that turn? I think I need to clarify the timing.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At the start of turn T, position is y_T.\n\n- Then action a_T is taken, which determines Δy, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\n- Collision is checked based on y_T and car spans at T.\n\nFor the sequence: actions from t = t1 to t1 + H -1, i.e., a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, and so on, after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at the start of turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, suppose H=1, then actions at t1, which sets y_{t1+1}, but we need y_{t1} =9, but start y_{t1}=1≠9, contradiction, so H≥2.\n\nAt turn t1, y_t1 given, not necessarily 9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} set, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is before the last action.\n\nLet k = t1 + H -1, we need y_k =9.\n\nThen action a_k is taken, which sets y_{k+1}, but we don't care about y_{k+1} since we stop at turn k with y_k=9.\n\nIn terms of actions, we take actions from turn t1 to turn k, since k = t1 + H -1, so number of actions H, from t=t1 to t=k.\n\nFor example, start at T=3, y=1.\n\nSuppose we want to reach at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen actions taken from turn 3 to turn T-1, since action at T-1 sets y_T.\n\nAction at turn S affects y_{S+1}.\n\nTo have y_T =9, we take action at turn T-1, which sets y_T.\n\nAlso, for turns before, actions set previous positions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, and we reach position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor that to happen, the actions from t1 to (t1+H-1)-1 = t1+H-2 affect the position up to y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nLet T_reach = t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T_reach, y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nActions are taken at turns from t1 to T_reach -1? No.\n\nActions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} = a_{T_reach}\n\nSince T_reach = t1 + H -1.\n\nAction at T_reach is taken, which would set y_{T_reach+1}, but we don't care, since we stop at turn T_reach with y_{T_reach}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{T_reach}=9, it depends on previous actions.\n\ny_{T_reach} is set by the action at T_reach -1.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt turn t1=3, y_3=1.\n\nAction a_3 at turn 3 sets y_4.\n\nAction a_4 at turn 4 sets y_5.\n\n...\n\nAction a_{K} at turn K sets y_{K+1}.\n\nWe need for some K, y_K =9.\n\nThen T_reach = K = t1 + H -1.\n\nActions are from t=t1 to t=K, that is, from 3 to K, number of actions H = K - 3 +1? Let's see.\n\nt from t1 to t1+H-1, so for t1=3, actions at 3,4,5,..., up to 3+H-1.\n\nSet y_4, y_5, ..., y_{3+H}\n\nBut we need y_{t1+H-1} = y_{3+H-1} =9.\n\nSo for example, if H=8, actions at t=3 to 10, set y_4 to y_11, and we need y_{10} =9? 3+8-1=10, so y_10=9.\n\ny_10 is set by action at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, for minimal H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince from y=1 to y=9, need to increase by 8, with U actions, it would take 8 actions to go from y_3=1 to y_11=9, for example.\n\nStart y_3=1.\n\nAfter a_3 (U), y_4=2\n\na_4 (U), y_5=3\n\n...\n\na_10 (U), y_11=9\n\nThen at turn 11, y_11=9, so T_reach=11, which is t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1, so 3+H-1=11, H=9.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=10, 8 actions? t from 3 to 10 inclusive is 8 actions? Turn 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: that's 8 actions.\n\nSet y_4 to y_11.\n\ny_11=9, and T_reach = t1 + H -1 =3 +8 -1=10? Inconsistency.\n\nt1 + H -1 =3 + H -1.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith 8 actions: actions at t=3 to t=10, H=8.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{3+8-1} = y_{10}\n\nBut in the sequence above, with all U, y_10 is set by a_9? Let's list turns:\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | then y_{T+1} set\n\nT=3: y_3=1, a_3=U, then y_4=2\n\nT=4: y_4=2, a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nT=5: y_5=3, a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nT=6: y_6=4, a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nT=7: y_7=5, a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nT=8: y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: y_9=7, a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: y_10=8, a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nBut we need y_{10} =9? Here y_10=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_K=9 for some K.\n\nIf K=11, y_11=9, then T_reach=11.\n\nActions to take: from T=3 to T=10, a_3 to a_10, 8 actions, then y_11=9.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1 =11, so 3+H-1=11, H=9.\n\nActions at t=3 to t=11? a_3 to a_11.\n\na_11 at T=11 sets y_12, but we need y_11=9.\n\ny_11 is set by a_10.\n\nSo to have y_11=9, we need actions from T=3 to T=10.\n\nNumber of actions H=8 (t=3 to 10).\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + H -1 =3+8-1=10, but y_10 is not 9, y_11 is 9.\n\nProblem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nFor H=8, t1+H-1=3+8-1=10, so y_10 should be 9.\n\nBut in the all U sequence, y_10=8.\n\nTo have y_10=9, we need to start from y_3=1, and after 7 actions, y_10=9.\n\ny_10 is set by a_9.\n\nPositions:\n\ny_3=1\n\na_3 sets y_4\n\n...\n\na_9 sets y_10\n\nSo to have y_10=9, actions from a_3 to a_9, 7 actions? T=3 to 9, 7 actions.\n\ny_3=1\n\nAfter a_3, y_4\n\nAfter a_4, y_5\n\n...\n\nAfter a_9, y_10\n\nSo from y_3 to y_10, 7 steps, so from y=1 to y=9, 8 levels, but only 7 actions needed to move 7 steps? y_3 to y_10 is 7 intervals, so change of 7 in y.\n\nFrom y_3=1 to y_10=9, net change +8, so need 8 U actions in 7 steps? Impossible with only U,D,S.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so to increase y by 8, from turn T to turn S, with S-T actions, the net change is at most S-T, so to have y_S - y_T =8, need at least 8 actions if all U, or more if some S or D.\n\nBut y_S - y_T = net sum of Δy from t=T to t=S-1.\n\nLet from turn A to turn B, number of turns between is B-A.\n\nPosition at turn B is y_B = y_A + sum_{t=A to B-1} Δy_t\n\nTo have y_B = y_A + 8, since y_A=1, y_B=9.\n\nThe sum of Δy from t=A to B-1 must be +8.\n\nEach Δy is +1,0,-1, so to have sum +8, need at least 8 actions, and all U if no waste.\n\nNumber of actions is from t=A to B-1 inclusive, so number of actions N = B - A.\n\nThen sum of N terms of Δy = +8.\n\nSince each |Δy|≤1, N ≥8.\n\nIf N=8, all Δy=+1, all U.\n\nThen y_B = y_A +8.\n\nIf y_A=1, y_B=9.\n\nIn this case, A is t1=3, B is T_reach = t1 + H -1.\n\ny_B =9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=A to B-1, but B-1 = (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2.\n\nActions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nFor action at t, it sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at B is y_B, which is set by action at B-1.\n\nThe actions are from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, which affect y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nSo y_{t1+H-1} is set by action at (t1+H-1)-1 = t1+H-2.\n\nThe net change from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H-1} is over (t1+H-1) - t1 = H-1 steps.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, there are (t1+H-1) - t1 = H-1 intervals, so H-1 actions affect the change.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1} + sum_{t=t1 to (t1+H-1)-1} Δy_t = y_{t1} + sum_{t=t1 to t1+H-2} Δy_t\n\nSince actions at t affect Δy_t for t from t1 to t1+H-2, but the actions are up to t1+H-1.\n\nActions at t=t1 to t1+H-1: a_t for t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\na_t affects y_{t+1} for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSpecifically, a_t sets y_{t+1} for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen y_{t1+1} set by a_{t1}, y_{t1+2} set by a_{t1+1}, ..., y_{t1+H} set by a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} is set by action at (t1+H-1) -1 = t1+H-2.\n\nFor example, t1=3, need y_{3+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{3+H-1} is set by a_{ (3+H-1) -1 } = a_{3+H-2}\n\nThe value y_{3+H-1} depends on the actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, which are H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t1+H-1}, which sets y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have to specify a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, but for reaching y_{t1+H-1}=9, only the first H-1 actions matter, and a_{t1+H-1} can be anything, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, which is safe, no collision possible.\n\nThen action a_{t1+H-1} is taken, but since we reach at that turn, it might not be used, but we have to include it in the sequence.\n\nFor minimal H, we probably want to reach as soon as possible, so H small.\n\nFrom y_3=1 to y_K=9 for some K.\n\nK = t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1.\n\ny_K = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to K-1} Δy_t\n\nNumber of terms in sum: from t=3 to K-1 inclusive, number is (K-1) -3 +1 = K-3.\n\nSum of K-3 terms of Δy.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so to have sum =8, K-3 >=8, so K >=11.\n\nThen for K=11, y_11=9, then sum from t=3 to 10 of Δy_t must be 8, so all Δy_t=1 for t=3 to 10, all U.\n\nK=11, t1+H-1=11, 3+H-1=11, H=9.\n\nActions at t=3 to 11? a_3 to a_11.\n\na_3 to a_10 set y_4 to y_11, and a_11 sets y_12, but we need y_11=9, set by a_10.\n\nFor y_11=9, K=11, T_reach=11.\n\nt1+H-1=11, 3+H-1=11, H=9.\n\nActions: a_t for t=3 to 11, that is 9 actions.\n\na_3 to a_10 affect y_4 to y_11, and a_11 affects y_12, but for reaching y_11=9, a_11 is not necessary, but it is included in the sequence.\n\nSimilarly, for collision, at turn 11, y_11=9, safe, so a_11 can be anything, say S or U, but since we reach at turn 11, it doesn't matter.\n\nTo minimize H, we should choose K as small as possible such that we can have y_K=9 with the actions.\n\nK min is 11, with all U from t=3 to 10.\n\nBut we have to check for collision during the path.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nPlayer starts at T=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9 as fast as possible, with all U actions, reaching y_11=9 at T=11.\n\nT_reach=11, H=9, actions from t=3 to 11.\n\nBut let's list the turns and positions with all U:\n\nT=3: y=1, action U, then y=2 for T=4\n\nT=4: y=2, action U, y=3 for T=5\n\nT=5: y=3, action U, y=4 for T=6\n\nT=6: y=4, action U, y=5 for T=7\n\nT=7: y=5, action U, y=6 for T=8\n\nT=8: y=6, action U, y=7 for T=9\n\nT=9: y=7, action U, y=8 for T=10\n\nT=10: y=8, action U, y=9 for T=11\n\nT=11: y=9, action ? but we reach at T=11.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, actions from t=3 to t=11 for H=9.\n\nBut at each turn, we need to check collision based on y_T.\n\nFor T from 3 to 10, since at T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, blocked freeways:\n\nAt T=3: y=1, freeway 1, never blocked, safe.\n\nT=4: y=2, freeway 2, never blocked, safe.\n\nT=5: y=3, freeway 3, blocked at T=6? T=5, is it blocked?\n\nFreeway 3 blocked at T=6, but at T=5, y=3.\n\nAt T=5, is freeway 3 blocked?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 3 blocked only at T=6, not at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, ΔT=5-3=2, for freeway 3, first car: at ΔT=2, span [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, other cars not near 0, so freeway 3 not blocked at T=5, so safe.\n\nT=6: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 blocked at T=6? Freeway 4 has same cars as 3, blocked at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nIs freeway 4 blocked at T=6? Yes, as per earlier.\n\nSo collision if player on y=4 at T=6.\n\nIn the path, at T=6, y=4, and freeway 4 blocked, so collision.\n\nCannot have this.\n\nSo all U path has collision at T=6.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nFreeway 4,5 also blocked at T=6, but at T=6, y=4, so freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5 all blocked at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, if on y=3,4, or5, collision.\n\nIn all U, at T=6, y=4, on freeway 4, blocked.\n\nNeed to not be on freeway 4 at T=6.\n\nOptions: be on different y at T=6, or be at y=0 or 9, but y=0 not possible yet.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, we might delay or go down to avoid.\n\nMinimal H might be larger.\n\nFirst, let's list the critical times.\n\nBlocked turns:\n\nT=6: freeways 3,4,5 blocked.\n\nT=11: freeways 6,7 blocked? Freeway 6,7,8 blocked at T=11 and T=12.\n\nAt T=11, freeway 6,7,8 blocked.\n\nBut T=11 is late, in the all U path, we are at lower y earlier.\n\nIn all U, we have problem at T=6.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=6, since y=4 at T=6, we need to not be on y=4 at that turn.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. At T=6, be on different y, not 4.\n\n2. Or, since we move, but at the turn, position is fixed before action.\n\nWe can change actions to be at different y at T=6.\n\nFor example, if we stay or go down at some point.\n\nStart at T=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 by some turn.\n\nMinimal K with y_K=9 is K=11 with all U, but not possible due to T=6.\n\nNext, K=12, but we can reach earlier with some U, but since min 8 actions, K=11 is earliest possible, but not feasible.\n\nWith all U, K=11.\n\nBut if we do S or D, K later.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach K=11 by being not on y=4 at T=6.\n\nFor example, at T=6, if y=3 or y=5 or other.\n\nIn all U, at T=5, y=3, T=6 y=4.\n\nSo to not be y=4 at T=6, we can:\n\n- At T=5, instead of U, do S, so y_6 = y_5 =3 (since action at T=5 sets y_6)\n\ny_T at turn T.\n\nAt T=5, y_5=3, if a_5=S, then y_6=3.\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, on freeway 3, which is blocked at T=6, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at T=5, a_5=D, then y_6=2.\n\nThen at T=6, y=2, freeway 2, never blocked, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=2 at T=6, lower than before.\n\nThen we need to go up from there.\n\nSimilarly, we could go up faster earlier or later.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=6, since all blocked.\n\ny=3,4,5 at T=6 blocked.\n\nAlso, later at T=11 and 12, y=6,7,8 blocked, but T=11 is later, we might be past that or not there yet.\n\nFirst, handle T=6.\n\nAt T=6, we must not be on y=3,4, or5.\n\nPossible positions at T=6: y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 or9 might not be reachable yet.\n\nFrom start, T=3, y=1.\n\nAfter actions at T=3,4,5, we set y_4,y_5,y_6.\n\nNumber of actions to affect: from T=3 to T=5, actions a3,a4,a5 set y4,y5,y6.\n\ny6 is set by a5.\n\ny3=1.\n\nWe need y6 such that it is not 3,4,5.\n\ny6 = y3 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5? y6 = y3 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5? No.\n\ny4 = y3 + Δy3\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4 = y3 + Δy3 + Δy4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5 = y3 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nSo y6 = 1 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y6 = 1 + sum of three Δy, so y6 between 1-3= -2? min y=0, so y6 between max(0,1-3)=0 and min(9,1+3)=4.\n\ny6 = 1 + s, where s = Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5, s between -3 and 3, but y6 >=0, <=9, so possible y6: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSince min s=-3, y6=1-3=-2<0, so y6=0 if s<=-1, etc.\n\nBut y6 >=0, so:\n\nIf s=-3, y6=1-3=-2, but y>=0, so y6=0\n\nSimilarly, if s=-2, y6=1-2=-1, y6=0\n\nIf s=-1, y6=1-1=0\n\nIf s=0, y6=1\n\ns=1, y6=2\n\ns=2, y6=3\n\ns=3, y6=4\n\nNow, we need y6 not 3,4,5 but possible y6 only 0,1,2,3,4, so not 3 or 4, so y6 must be 0,1,2.\n\nBecause 5 not possible in three steps from y=1.\n\ny6 can be 0,1,2.\n\nNow, for each:\n\n- y6=0: then must have s<=-1, so some D actions.\n\n- y6=1: s=0\n\n- y6=2: s=1\n\nNow, at T=6, if y6=0,1, or2, all safe, since freeway 1 and 2 never blocked, and y=0 safe.\n\nBut y=0 is bottom, might not be desirable.\n\nSimilarly, y6=1 or 2.\n\nNow, after that, we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom T=6, y=y6, to y_K=9 for some K.\n\nNumber of steps to increase: from y6 to 9, need increase of 9 - y6.\n\nWith all U, it takes (9 - y6) actions to reach y_{6 + (9-y6)} = y_{15 - y6}\n\nFor example, if y6=2, need to increase by 7, to y_{6+7}=y13, with actions from t=6 to 12.\n\nThen T_reach = y13=9, so K=13.\n\nt1 + H -1 =13, 3+H-1=13, H=11.\n\nSimilarly, if y6=1, need increase by 8, to y14, K=14, H=12? t1+H-1=14, H=12.\n\nIf y6=0, increase by 9, to y15, K=15, H=13.\n\nBut we have later block at T=11,12 for y=6,7,8.\n\nTo minimize H, we want y6 as high as possible, so y6=2.\n\nThen K=13, H=11.\n\nNow, with y6=2.\n\nNow, we need to achieve y6=2 from start.\n\ny6 =1 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 =2, so Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 =1.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, need one U and two S, or one U, one S, one D but net +1, etc.\n\nBut to minimize time, probably use U as much as possible.\n\nNow, during T=3,4,5, we need no collision.\n\nT=3: y=1, freeway 1, never blocked, safe.\n\nAction a3.\n\nThen y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nT=4: y=y4, which could be 0,1,2.\n\nIf y4=0, freeway not, safe.\n\ny4=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\ny4=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nSimilarly T=5: y=y5, freeway depending on y5.\n\ny5 between 0 and 4, as above.\n\nNow, freeways 1 and 2 never blocked, so no issue for T=4 and T=5.\n\nOnly need to set actions to have y6=2.\n\nFor example, simplest: a3=U, then y4=2\n\nThen a4=S, y5=2\n\na5=S, y6=2\n\nOr a3=S, y4=1\n\na4=U, y5=2\n\na5=S, y6=2\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, from T=6, y=2, need to go to y=9.\n\nWith all U: actions a6 to a12, U each, then y7=3, y8=4, y9=5, y10=6, y11=7, y12=8, y13=9.\n\nSo T=13, y13=9.\n\nNow, check collision during T=6 to T=12.\n\nT=6: y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nT=7: y=3, freeway 3. Now, is it blocked? Freeway 3 blocked only at T=6, not at other times. T=7, ΔT=7-3=4, span for first car: [-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12], 0 not in, other cars not, so safe.\n\nT=8: y=4, freeway 4. Blocked only at T=6, T=8 ΔT=5, span [-47+60, -36+60]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=9: y=5, freeway 5. Similarly, blocked at T=6, T=9 ΔT=6, span [-47+72, -36+72]=[25,36], not near 0, safe.\n\nT=10: y=6, freeway 6. Now, freeway 6 blocked at T=11 and 12.\n\nT=10, ΔT=10-3=7, for freeway 6 car: span at T: [-59 +6*7, -48 +6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nT=11: y=7, freeway 7. Blocked at T=11? Yes, freeway 7 blocked at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=7, on freeway 7, which is blocked, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=11, freeways 6,7,8 blocked.\n\nIn the path, at T=11, y=7, blocked.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, if we were there, blocked.\n\nBut in this path, at T=11, y=7.\n\nTo avoid, we need not to be on y=6,7,8 at T=11 or T=12.\n\nSpecifically for T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow, in this case, from T=6 y=2, all U to T=11 y=7.\n\nBut at T=11, collision.\n\nWe can adjust the speed.\n\nFor example, at some point, stay or go down to delay.\n\nSince T=11 and 12 blocked for y=6,7,8, we can be before or after.\n\nFor instance, at T=11, if y=5 or y=9, etc.\n\ny=9 is goal.\n\nIn the current plan, we reach y=9 at T=13.\n\nAt T=11, y=7, which is bad.\n\nWe can make y lower at T=11.\n\nFrom T=6 to T=11, 5 turns: actions a6 to a10 set y7 to y11.\n\ny6=2\n\ny11 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10? y11 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t\n\nNumber of actions: t=6 to 10, 5 actions, set y7 to y11.\n\ny11 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y11 between 2-5= -3? min 0, max 2+5=7.\n\ny11 from 0 to 7.\n\nWe need y11 not 6,7,8 but max 7, so not 6 or 7 if possible, but 8 not possible, so avoid y11=6 or7.\n\nSince freeway 6,7,8 blocked at T=11, so if y11=6,7, or8, collision.\n\nBut y11 <=7, so avoid y11=6 or7.\n\nThus y11 must be <=5 or >=9, but >=9 not possible since y11<=7<9, so y11 <=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, but we may reach before.\n\nFirst, for T=11, y11 <=5.\n\ny11 = 2 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t <=5\n\nSo sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t <=3\n\nBut we want to reach y=9 fast, so we might have sum high.\n\ny11 <=5.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, need at least 4 more U, to y15, etc., later.\n\nBut we can have y11 lower.\n\nIn our case, with all U from T=6, y11=2 +5=7, which is bad.\n\nSo need to reduce the sum.\n\nFor example, with some S or D.\n\nBut let's see the range.\n\ny11 must be <=5.\n\nPossible y11=0 to5.\n\nBut to minimize time, want y11 as high as possible, so y11=5.\n\nThen from y11=5 to y=9, need 4 U, to y15, K=15.\n\nBut earlier we had K=13 with y6=2, but now with y11=5, K=15 later.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we go faster.\n\nAnother idea: avoid the block at T=11 by being not on the freeway, or at different time.\n\nSince T=11 and 12 blocked, we can be on y=6,7,8 before T=11 or after T=12.\n\nFor example, at T=10, y=6, which is safe as before.\n\nAt T=11, if we are not on y=6,7,8, but on lower or higher.\n\nWith all U from T=6 y=2:\n\nT=6: y=2\n\na6=U, y7=3\n\nT=7: y=3, a7=U, y8=4\n\nT=8: y=4, a8=U, y9=5\n\nT=9: y=5, a9=U, y10=6\n\nT=10: y=6, a10=U, y11=7\n\nAt T=11, y=7, blocked.\n\nTo not be at y=7 at T=11, we can, for example, at T=10, instead of U, do S or D.\n\nIf at T=10, a10=S, then y11=6\n\nBut at T=11, y=6, freeway 6 blocked, collision.\n\nIf a10=D, y11=5, then at T=11, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 blocked at T=11? Freeway 5 blocked only at T=6, not at T=11.\n\nT=11, ΔT=8, for freeway 5 cars, first car span [-47+96, -36+96]=[49,60], not near 0, so safe.\n\ny=5, freeway 5 not blocked at T=11.\n\nThen y11=5.\n\nThen from there, need to go to y=9.\n\nWith all U: a11=U, y12=6\n\nBut at T=12, y=6, freeway 6 blocked at T=12, collision.\n\na11=U, y12=6, T=12 y=6 blocked.\n\nIf at T=11, y=5, a11=S, y12=5, then at T=12, y=5, safe, not blocked.\n\nThen need to go up later.\n\nBut slower.\n\na11=U to y12=6, but T=12 blocked.\n\nTo avoid T=12, if we can be at y=6 before or after.\n\nAt T=12, freeway 6,7,8 blocked, so if on y=6,7,8 at T=12, collision.\n\nIn this case, with y11=5, if a11=U, y12=6, then T=12 y=6 blocked.\n\nIf a11=S, y12=5, then T=12 y=5 safe.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=6, but T=13, is it blocked?\n\nT=13, ΔT=10, freeway 6 car: span [-59 +60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not blocked.\n\nThen y13=6, a13=U, y14=7, T=14 y=7, freeway 7, at ΔT=11, span [-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny14=7, a14=U, y15=8, T=15 y=8, freeway 8, at ΔT=12, span for first car: [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24], 0 not in, second car not near, safe.\n\nThen y15=8, a15=U, y16=9, then at turn 16, y16=9.\n\nBut we need y_K=9 for K=16, T_reach=16.\n\nThen H: t1+H-1=16, 3+H-1=16, H=14.\n\nBut earlier with y6=2, we can do better.\n\nBack to after T=6 y=2.\n\nWe need to handle the T=11 block.\n\nAt T=11, we must not be on y=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly at T=12.\n\nSince we are going up, we can be below or above.\n\nFor example, at T=11, be at y=5 or less.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=6, to y=5 at T=11, with 5 actions, net change +3, so some S or D.\n\ny11 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t = 2 + s, where s = sum of 5 Δy.\n\ny11 <=5, so s <=3.\n\nBut to reach y=9 fast, we want s high, so y11=5, s=3.\n\nThen with 3 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nThen from T=11 y=5, then to y=9, need 4 U, to y15.\n\nK=15, H for T_reach=15, t1+H-1=15, H=13.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 earlier if we go faster before or after the block.\n\nAnother idea: pass through y=6,7,8 before T=11 or after T=12.\n\nFor example, at T=10, y=6 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen at T=11, if we can be at y=9 or something.\n\nFrom T=6 y=2:\n\nWith actions, we can have y10 high.\n\ny10 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\n4 actions, y10 = 2 + sum_{t=6 to 9} Δy_t, between 2-4= -2? min 0, max 6.\n\ny10 from 0 to 6.\n\nIf we can have y10=6, then at T=10, y=6, safe as before.\n\nThen at T=10, y=6, action a10.\n\nIf a10=U, y11=7, but T=11 y=7 blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf a10=S, y11=6, T=11 y=6 blocked.\n\nAlso bad.\n\nIf a10=D, y11=5, then T=11 y=5, safe.\n\nThen from there, need to go up.\n\nBut y11=5, then to y=9, need 4 U, to y15.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo be at y=8 or 9 at T=11.\n\nBut y11 <=7 from y=2, so max y11=7, but at T=11, y=7 blocked, so not possible to be at high y at T=11 without collision.\n\ny11=7 is possible but blocked.\n\nSo must have y11 <=5.\n\nThen K=15.\n\nBut let's see if we can be after T=12.\n\nFor example, at T=12, if we are on y=6,7,8, blocked, so we need to be below or above.\n\nAt T=12, y must not be 6,7,8.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nSo if we can reach y=9 by T=12 or before.\n\nBut min with all U from y=1 is T=11, but with blocks, not possible.\n\nFrom start, with y6=2, all U, we can be at y=8 at T=12? Let's see.\n\nFrom T=6 y=2:\n\nT=6: y=2\n\na6=U, y7=3\n\nT=7: y=3, a7=U, y8=4\n\nT=8: y=4, a8=U, y9=5\n\nT=9: y=5, a9=U, y10=6\n\nT=10: y=6, a10=U, y11=7\n\nT=11: y=7, a11=U, y12=8\n\nAt T=12, y=8, freeway 8 blocked at T=12, collision.\n\nIf we slow down, at T=10, y=6, a10=S, y11=6, T=11 blocked.\n\na10=D, y11=5, T=11 y=5 safe.\n\nThen a11=U, y12=6, T=12 y=6 blocked.\n\na11=S, y12=5, then a12=U, y13=6, T=13 y=6, now T=13, ΔT=10, freeway 6 not blocked, safe.\n\nThen a13=U, y14=7, T=14 y=7, safe.\n\na14=U, y15=8, T=15 y=8, safe.\n\na15=U, y16=9, T=16 y=9.\n\nK=16, H=14.\n\nBut we can do better by having y6 higher.\n\nEarlier I set y6=2 to avoid T=6 block, but with y6=2, we are low.\n\nCan we have y6 higher? But earlier, y6 can only be up to 4, but at T=6, y=4 is blocked, y=3 blocked, so only y=0,1,2 possible, so y=2 is best.\n\ny6=2.\n\nThen from there, to avoid T=11 block, we need to have y11<=5.\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=2 to T=11 y=5.\n\nWith 5 actions, net change +3, so for example, three U and two S.\n\nThen y11=5.\n\nThen from T=11 y=5, with all U: a11=U, y12=6\n\nT=12 y=6, but T=12 blocked for y=6, collision.\n\na11=U to y12=6, T=12 blocked.\n\nIf a11=S, y12=5, T=12 y=5 safe.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=6, T=13 y=6 safe (as above).\n\na13=U, y14=7 safe.\n\na14=U, y15=8 safe.\n\na15=U, y16=9.\n\nK=16.\n\nTo save time, from y11=5, if we can go faster, but at T=12, we cannot be on y=6,7,8, so must be below or above.\n\nAbove not possible, so below.\n\nSo at T=12, y<=5.\n\nThen from y11=5, if a11=U, y12=6 blocked.\n\nSo must do a11=S or D to stay at y=5 or less at T=12.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nSo K=16 is the earliest with this path.\n\nBut perhaps we can start with different y6 or handle the blocks differently.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, for T=6, instead of y6=2, we can have y6=1 or 0, but that would be worse, take longer to go up.\n\nSo y6=2 is best.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 before T=11.\n\nBut from y=1 at T=3, to y=9 at T=10 or earlier.\n\nMin T=11 with all U, but not possible due to T=6 block.\n\nWith all U, K=11, but at T=6, y=4 blocked.\n\nTo reach K=11, we need to be at y=9 at T=11.\n\ny11=9.\n\nBut y11 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to 10} Δy_t =1 + s, s= sum of 8 Δy, s=8 for all U, but not possible.\n\ns must be 8, all U, but then at T=6, y6=1 + Δy3+Δy4+Δy5, with all U, y6=1+3=4, which is blocked at T=6.\n\nIf we have some S or D before, s<8, y11<9, not 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, y10 =1 + sum_{t=3 to 9} Δy_t, 7 actions, max y10=1+7=8, not 9.\n\nAt T=12, y12=1 + sum_{t=3 to 11} Δy_t, 9 actions, max y12=10>9, but y<=9, so possible y12=9 with s=8.\n\nBut T=12 is later than 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at T=12 with no collision.\n\ny12=9.\n\nThen H: T_reach=12, t1+H-1=12, 3+H-1=12, H=10.\n\nActions from t=3 to 11.\n\nNow, to have y12=9, need sum_{t=3 to 11} Δy_t =8, with 9 actions (t=3 to 11), so possible, for example 8 U and one S, or 8 U and one D but net less, so best 8 U and one S.\n\ny12 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to 11} Δy_t? y12 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to 11} Δy_t\n\nt from 3 to 11, 9 actions.\n\ny3=1, so y12=1 + sum of 9 Δy, each -1,0,1, so y12 between 1-9= -8? min 0, max 1+9=10.\n\nTo have y12=9, need sum =8.\n\nSo 8 U and one S or 7 U and two D but net +8 only with 8U and one S, or 9U but y12=10>9, not allowed, so must have one S.\n\nSimilarly, with D, net less, so only with 8U and one S.\n\nNow, the S can be at different times.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions at critical points.\n\nFirst, at T=6, must not be on y=3,4,5.\n\ny6 =1 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\ny6 must be 0,1,2.\n\nAlso, for T=11 and T=12, must not be on y=6,7,8 if blocked.\n\nT=11: freeways 6,7,8 blocked, so if y11=6,7,8, collision.\n\nT=12: same, if y12=6,7,8, collision.\n\nBut at T=12, we have y12=9, which is safe, so no issue.\n\nAt T=11, y11 must not be 6,7,8.\n\ny11 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to 10} Δy_t =1 + sum of 8 terms (t=3 to 10) but for y11.\n\ny11 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to 10} Δy_t? y11 = y3 + Δy3 + ... + Δy10\n\nt from 3 to 10, 8 actions.\n\ny3=1, so y11=1 + s8, s8 = sum_{t=3 to 10} Δy_t\n\ns8 between -8 and 8, y11 between 0 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, y12=1 + s9, where s9 = sum_{t=3 to 11} Δy_t\n\nFor y12=9, s9=8.\n\ns9 = s8 + Δy11\n\nSince s9=8, and Δy11 in {-1,0,1}, so s8 = 8 - Δy11\n\nIf Δy11=0, s8=8\n\nIf Δy11=1, s8=7\n\nIf Δy11=-1, s8=9, impossible, so Δy11=0 or 1.\n\nBut y12=9, so if Δy11=1, y12=y11+1, so y11=8\n\nIf Δy11=0, y12=y11, so y11=9\n\nBut at T=11, if y11=9, safe, good.\n\nIf y11=8, and T=11, y=8 blocked, collision.\n\nSo to avoid, we must have y11=9, so that at T=11, y=9 safe.\n\nThen Δy11=0, a11=S, and s8=8, so all U from t=3 to 10.\n\nBut y11=1 + s8 =1+8=9.\n\nThen a11=S, y12=9.\n\nBut we need y12=9 for T_reach=12? T_reach is turn with y=9, but at T=11, y11=9, so we can reach at T=11.\n\nIf we reach at T=11 with y11=9, then T_reach=11, H=9 as before, but with the block at T=6.\n\nBut with all U from t=3 to 10, y11=9, but at T=6, y6=4, blocked.\n\nSo we need to have the S earlier to avoid y6=4.\n\nFor y12=9, with s9=8, and to have y11=9, so Δy11=0, a11=S.\n\nThen s8=8, so actions from t=3 to 10 all U, but then y6=4, blocked at T=6.\n\nIf we have the S before, but s8=8 requires all U from 3 to 10, no S, so y6=4 inevitable.\n\nThus, for reaching at T=12, we cannot have y11=9 because it requires all U before, causing collision at T=6.\n\nIf we have Δy11=1, then y11=8, y12=9.\n\nBut at T=11, y11=8, which is blocked, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, reaching at T=12 with y12=9 is not feasible because it forces y11=8 or 9, but y11=8 blocked, y11=9 requires all U before with collision at T=6.\n\nSo impossible to reach at T=12 with no collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=13: y13=9.\n\nThen t1+H-1=13, 3+H-1=13, H=11.\n\nActions from t=3 to 12.\n\ny13=9 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to 12} Δy_t =1 + s10, s10= sum 10 Δy, so need s10=8.\n\n10 actions, sum=8, so for example 8U and 2S, or 9U and 1D but net 8, etc.\n\nNow, we need to avoid blocks.\n\nAt T=6, y6 must be 0,1,2.\n\ny6 =1 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nMust be 0,1,2.\n\nAt T=11 and T=12, must not be on y=6,7,8 if blocked.\n\nBut at T=11, if y11=6,7,8, collision.\n\nT=12 similar.\n\nBut since we reach at T=13, at T=13 y=9 safe.\n\nLet's plan the path with y6=2 as before.\n\nFrom T=3 to T=6 with y6=2.\n\nFor example: a3=U, y4=2 (since y3=1, U to 2)\n\nThen a4=S, y5=2\n\na5=S, y6=2\n\nOr other ways.\n\nNow from T=6 y=2 to T=13 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from a6 to a12, 7 actions, set y7 to y13.\n\ny13 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 12} Δy_t =2 + s7, s7= sum 7 Δy.\n\ny13=9, so 2 + s7 =9, s7=7, so all U from t=6 to 12.\n\nThen y7=3, y8=4, y9=5, y10=6, y11=7, y12=8, y13=9.\n\nNow check collisions:\n\nT=6: y=2, safe\n\nT=7: y=3, freeway 3, not blocked (only at T=6), safe\n\nT=8: y=4, freeway 4, not blocked, safe\n\nT=9: y=5, freeway 5, not blocked, safe\n\nT=10: y=6, freeway 6, not blocked (blocked at T=11,12), at T=10 ΔT=7, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe\n\nT=11: y=7, freeway 7, blocked at T=11, collision! Oh.\n\nForgot T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=7, blocked.\n\nSo still problem.\n\nTo avoid, at T=11, we need y11 not 7.\n\nWith all U, y11=7.\n\nSo we need to have less at T=11.\n\nFor example, insert a S or D somewhere.\n\nBut y13=9 requires s7=7, all U, so no room for S or D.\n\nUnless we reach later.\n\nWith 7 actions, max y13=2+7=9, so all U necessary.\n\nBut then at T=11, y=7 blocked.\n\nSo must have fewer U or later reach.\n\nGo for T=14 or something.\n\nBut let's accept that for the path from T=6, we need to have y11<=5.\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=2 to T=11 y=5.\n\nWith 5 actions a6 to a10, set y7 to y11.\n\ny11 =2 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t =5, so sum=3.\n\nFor example, three U and two S.\n\nSay, a6=U, y7=3\n\na7=U, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=S, y10=5\n\na10=S, y11=5\n\nThen at T=11, y=5, safe.\n\nThen from T=11 y=5, need to go to y=9.\n\nWith all U: a11=U, y12=6\n\nBut at T=12, y=6, freeway 6 blocked, collision.\n\na11=U to y12=6, T=12 blocked.\n\na11=S, y12=5, T=12 y=5 safe.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=6, T=13 y=6, now T=13 ΔT=10, freeway 6 not blocked, safe.\n\na13=U, y14=7, T=14 y=7, freeway 7 at ΔT=11, span for freeway 7 car: same as 6, [-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\na14=U, y15=8, T=15 y=8, freeway 8 at ΔT=12, span [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\na15=U, y16=9, T=16 y=9.\n\nThen T_reach=16, H: t1+H-1=16, 3+H-1=16, H=14.\n\nActions include up to a15.\n\nBut we have a11 to a15.\n\nNow for the beginning, we have a3 to a5 for y6=2.\n\nFor example, a3=U, a4=S, a5=S, or other.\n\nLet's write the full sequence.\n\nStart T=3, y=1\n\na3=U, then y4=2\n\nT=4, y=2, a4=S, then y5=2\n\nT=5, y=2, a5=S, then y6=2\n\nT=6, y=2, a6=U, then y7=3\n\nT=7, y=3, a7=U, then y8=4\n\nT=8, y=4, a8=U, then y9=5\n\nT=9, y=5, a9=S, then y10=5\n\nT=10, y=5, a10=S, then y11=5  (since a10=S)\n\nT=11, y=5, a11=S, then y12=5  (safe at T=12)\n\nT=12, y=5, a12=U, then y13=6\n\nT=13, y=6, a13=U, then y14=7\n\nT=14, y=7, a14=U, then y15=8\n\nT=15, y=8, a15=U, then y16=9\n\nAt T=16, y=9, reached.\n\nH=14, actions from t=3 to 15.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions for the sequence.\n\nThe reach turn is T=16, t1+H-1=16, 3+H-1=16, H=14.\n\nActions: a3 to a15.\n\nBut a15 is at turn 15, which sets y16, but we reach at turn 16 with y16=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list actions from t1 to t1+H-1, which is t=3 to 16? t1+H-1=3+14-1=16.\n\nActions at t=3 to 16, but that's 14 actions? t from 3 to 16 inclusive is 14 actions? 16-3+1=14, yes.\n\nBut in the above, I have actions up to a15, which is turn 15, for y16.\n\nFor turn 16, we need to specify a16, but a16 sets y17, which is not needed, but since we reach at turn 16, a16 can be S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=3 to t=16 for H=14.\n\na16 can be S.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce H.\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, we can have y6=2 with fewer S, but not necessary.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 1 and 2 are always safe, we can stay there longer.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nTo save time, from T=6 y=2, instead of going up slow to avoid T=11, we can go up fast but be at y=9 before T=11.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=6, to y=9 at T=10: y10 =2 + sum_{t=6 to 9} Δy_t, 4 actions, max y10=6, not 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nT=11: y11=2+5=7 max, not 9.\n\nSo cannot reach before T=13 with all U, but with collision.\n\nSo the path above with K=16 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's check if we can be at higher y at T=6.\n\nEarlier y6 must be 0,1,2, so 2 is best.\n\nPerhaps for T=6, we can be at y=6 or something, but at T=6, y=6 is on freeway 6, which is not blocked at T=6, only at T=11,12.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at T=6, from y=1 at T=3.\n\ny6 =1 + Δy3+Δy4+Δy5 =6, so sum=5, with 3 actions, impossible, max y6=1+3=4.\n\ny6=4, but at T=6, y=4 on freeway 4 blocked, so not possible.\n\ny6=3 or 4 or 5 not possible due to block or range.\n\nSo only y=0,1,2 at T=6.\n\nSo y6=2 is best.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 14 with the path above.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nPlayer position at each turn:\n\nT=3: y=1, action a3=U\n\nThen y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2, action a4=S\n\ny5=2\n\nT=5: y=2, action a5=S\n\ny6=2\n\nT=6: y=2, action a6=U\n\ny7=3\n\nT=7: y=3, action a7=U\n\ny8=4\n\nT=8: y=4, action a8=U\n\ny9=5\n\nT=9: y=5, action a9=S\n\ny10=5\n\nT=10: y=5, action a10=S\n\ny11=5\n\nT=11: y=5, action a11=S\n\ny12=5\n\nT=12: y=5, action a12=U\n\ny13=6\n\nT=13: y=6, action a13=U\n\ny14=7\n\nT=14: y=7, action a14=U\n\ny15=8\n\nT=15: y=8, action a15=U\n\ny16=9\n\nAt T=16, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nT=3: y=1, freeway 1, not blocked, safe\n\nT=4: y=2, freeway 2, not blocked, safe\n\nT=5: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nT=6: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nT=7: y=3, freeway 3, at ΔT=4, not blocked, safe\n\nT=8: y=4, freeway 4, at ΔT=5, not blocked, safe\n\nT=9: y=5, freeway 5, at ΔT=6, not blocked, safe\n\nT=10: y=5, freeway 5, safe (same)\n\nT=11: y=5, freeway 5, not blocked, safe\n\nT=12: y=5, freeway 5, not blocked, safe\n\nT=13: y=6, freeway 6, at ΔT=10, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe\n\nT=14: y=7, freeway 7, at ΔT=11, [7,18], 0 not in, safe\n\nT=15: y=8, freeway 8, at ΔT=12, [13,24], 0 not in, safe\n\nT=16: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nFor example, if we can reach at T=15.\n\nT_reach=15, y15=9.\n\nThen t1+H-1=15, 3+H-1=15, H=13.\n\nActions from t=3 to 14? t=3 to t1+H-1=15? Actions at t=3 to 14 for H=12? Let's calculate.\n\nT_reach = t1 + H -1 =15\n\n3 + H -1 =15, H=13.\n\nActions at t=3 to 15? t from 3 to 15 inclusive, 13 actions.\n\ny15=9 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to 14} Δy_t =1 + s12, s12= sum 12 Δy, so need s12=8.\n\n12 actions, sum=8, so for example 8U and 4S.\n\nNow, we need y6=0,1,2.\n\ny6 =1 + Δy3+Δy4+Δy5\n\nMust be <=2.\n\nAlso, at T=11 and T=12, y11 and y12 must not be 6,7,8 if on freeway.\n\ny11 =1 + sum_{t=3 to 10} Δy_t\n\ny12 =1 + sum_{t=3 to 11} Δy_t\n\nTo have s12=8 for y15.\n\nBut y15 depends on actions up to a14.\n\nIt might be possible with careful choice.\n\nFor example, have the S actions at times to avoid blocks.\n\nBut at T=6, we need y6<=2.\n\nSuppose we have some S early to have y6=2.\n\nThen from there, to y15=9, with actions from t=6 to 14, 9 actions, y15 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 14} Δy_t =2 + s9\n\nSet to 9, so s9=7.\n\n9 actions, sum=7, so 7U and 2S.\n\nNow, we need to avoid T=11 and T=12 blocks.\n\nFor example, at T=11, y11 must not be 6,7,8.\n\ny11 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t =2 + s5, s5= sum of 5 Δy from t=6 to 10.\n\ns5 between -5 and 5.\n\ny11=2+s5.\n\nMust not be 6,7,8, so 2+s5 <=5 or >=9 impossible, so s5 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, y12 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 11} Δy_t =2 + s6, s6= sum t=6 to 11, 6 actions.\n\ny12=2+s6, must not be 6,7,8, so s6 <=4.\n\nNow, with s9=7 for the sum to y15.\n\ns9 = sum t=6 to 14 Δy.\n\nWe can have s5 <=3 and s6 <=4.\n\nFor example, with 7U and 2S in 9 actions.\n\nTo minimize time, place S not during up, but at safe times.\n\nBut freeways 1-5 are safe except T=6, but after T=6, all safe except T=11,12 for 6,7,8.\n\nSo we can go up steadily but pause at T=11 or something.\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=2:\n\na6=U, y7=3\n\na7=U, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=U, y10=6\n\nNow at T=10, y=6, safe.\n\na10=S, y11=6\n\nBut at T=11, y=6, freeway 6 blocked, collision. Not good.\n\na10=D, y11=5, then T=11 y=5 safe.\n\nThen a11=U, y12=6, T=12 y=6 blocked.\n\na11=S, y12=5, T=12 y=5 safe.\n\nThen need to continue to y15=9.\n\nFrom y12=5, need to y15=9, so increase by 4 in 3 actions? y15 = y12 + Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14\n\nSo y15 =5 + Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14\n\nSet to 9, so Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14 =4, impossible, max +3.\n\nSo y15 <=8.\n\nNot enough to reach 9.\n\nWith actions up to a14, y15 set.\n\nFrom y12=5, with a12,a13,a14, y13,y14,y15.\n\ny15 = y12 + Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14\n\nMax y15=5+3=8<9.\n\nSo cannot reach y15=9 from y12=5 in three steps.\n\nIf we have y12 higher.\n\nIn the sequence, if at T=10, y=6, a10=D to y11=5.\n\nThen a11=U to y12=6, but T=12 blocked if y12=6.\n\nNot possible.\n\na11=S to y12=5, then y12=5.\n\nThen to y15, max 8.\n\nSo impossible to reach y15=9.\n\nIf we go faster earlier.\n\nFor example, from T=6, all U to T=10 y=6.\n\nThen at T=10, if we do a10=U, y11=7, T=11 blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo no way to reach at T=15 with no collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=14: y14=9, but from y=1, min with all U is T=11, not possible, T=14 might be possible but likely similar issues.\n\nThus, the earliest is T=16 with H=14.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow to write the actions.\n\nFrom t=3 to 15, but actions up to a15 for y16.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1=3 to 16.\n\nH=14, actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16? t from 3 to 16 inclusive is 14 actions? 16-3+1=14, yes.\n\nBut a16 sets y17, not needed.\n\nIn the path, we have actions up to a15 for y16.\n\nFor turn 16, we need to specify a16, which can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the answer format.\n\nBut let's list the actions from the path I have:\n\nAt turn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nThen for turn 16, since we reach at turn 16, action can be S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, it must be included.\n\nTo save an action, but we need H minimal, and this works.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the S actions.\n\nFor example, in the beginning, to have y6=2, we did a3=U, a4=S, a5=S.\n\nWe can do a3=S, a4=U, a5=S, same y6=2.\n\nOr a3=U, a4=U, but y4=2, y5=3, then a5=D to y6=2, but at T=5, y=3, which is freeway 3, not blocked at T=5, safe, and a5=D to y6=2.\n\nThen we save one S? No, in terms of time, same.\n\nBut in the later part, we have many S.\n\nFrom T=9 to T=11, we have S, to stay at y=5.\n\nWe could go higher earlier.\n\nBut due to T=11 block, we need to be low at T=11.\n\nSince freeways 1-5 are safe after T=6, we can be at y=5 from T=9 to T=12, for example.\n\nIn the path, at T=12, we go up.\n\nBut at T=12, if we are on y=5, safe.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut to reach faster, if we can start going up earlier from T=11, but at T=11, if we are at y=5, we can do U, but then y12=6, blocked.\n\nSo must wait until T=13 to go to y=6.\n\nThus, I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nSo the action sequence:\n\nTurn t1: U  (a3=U)\n\nTurn t1+1: S  (a4=S)\n\nTurn t1+2: S  (a5=S)\n\nTurn t1+3: U  (a6=U)\n\nTurn t1+4: U  (a7=U)\n\nTurn t1+5: U  (a8=U)\n\nTurn t1+6: S  (a9=S)\n\nTurn t1+7: S  (a10=S)\n\nTurn t1+8: S  (a11=S)\n\nTurn t1+9: U  (a12=U)\n\nTurn t1+10: U  (a13=U)\n\nTurn t1+11: U  (a14=U)\n\nTurn t1+12: U  (a15=U)\n\nThen for turn t1+13, which is turn 16, action S, but since we reach at turn 16, and action at turn 16 is not necessary, but in the sequence, we need to include up to t1+H-1=16.\n\nH=14, t1=3, t1+H-1=3+14-1=16.\n\nSo action at turn 16: can be S.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions from turn 3 to 15, missing turn 16.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for the index.\n\nActions: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\n\nt1=3, so a_{3+t} for t=0 to 13? H=14, t from 0 to 13.\n\na_{3+0} = a3\n\na_{3+1}=a4\n\n...\n\na_{3+13}=a16\n\nYes.\n\nIn my list, I have a3 to a15, that's t=0 to 12? t from 0 to 13 is 14 actions: t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 → a3 to a16.\n\nI have up to a15, which is t=12, missing a16.\n\nSo for a16, set to S.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, it doesn't affect.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S  (or anything)\n\nBut at turn 16, position is already 9, so action doesn't matter.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can remove one S.\n\nFor example, at T=9, instead of S, do U, but then y10=6, then if a10=S, y11=6, T=11 blocked.\n\nIf a10=D, y11=5, then at T=11 safe, but y11=5, same as before, but we lost one U, so later need more actions to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from y11=5, with all U, to y15=9, but with actions, y12=6, but if at T=12, y=6 blocked, so cannot, must wait.\n\nThus, not better.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, minimal H=14.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 16, since we are at y=9, and action, but collision not checked after, so ok.\n\nTo not have extra action, but we must include in the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, list as per turns.\n\nSo in the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 14. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a blocked freeway at critical turns. Specifically:\n- Freeways 3, 4, and 5 are blocked at turn 6, so the player must not be on \\(y = 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at that turn.\n- Freeways 6, 7, and 8 are blocked at turns 11 and 12, so the player must not be on \\(y = 6, 7,\\) or \\(8\\) at those turns.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 3 and ends at turn 16 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 14 - 1 = 16\\)), with the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16. The actions are chosen to:\n- Reach \\(y = 2\\) by turn 6 to avoid the block at turn 6 (since \\(y = 2\\) is safe).\n- Stay at \\(y = 5\\) during turns 11 and 12 to avoid the blocks at those turns (since \\(y = 5\\) is safe).\n- Proceed to \\(y = 9\\) after turn 12 when the freeways are clear.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 3, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 5.\n- At turn 5, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 6 (avoiding block at turn 6).\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 5\\) for turn 10.\n- At turn 10, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 5\\) for turn 11 (avoiding block at turn 11).\n- At turn 11, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 5\\) for turn 12 (avoiding block at turn 12).\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, stay (S) (action is arbitrary since \\(y = 9\\) is reached and safe).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\, S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span decreases over time because they're moving left, so h and tau both decrease by s per turn. For right-moving cars, h and tau increase by s per turn.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when I move, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I'm not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nThe player position is updated at each turn based on the action: U for up, D for down, S for stay.\n\nI start at turn 4, position (0,2). I need to reach (0,9).\n\nThe minimal number of turns H means I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1 = 4.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=48, tau=83, s=36. Since it's left-moving, head at 48, tail at 83? That seems odd. For left-moving, head is the front, which should be smaller if it's moving left, but here h=48, tau=83, and since it's moving left, head should be left, so smaller x, but 48 < 83, so if moving left, head at 48, tail at 83, but as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it's given as [h, tau], and h decreases, tau decreases.\n\nBut in this case for freeway 1, [48,83] at turn 4.\n\nAs time increases, for left-moving car, span becomes [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [tau, h] becomes [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so at T, span is [48 - 36(T-4), 83 - 36(T-4)]\n\nCollision if player is on freeway k at turn T and 0 in span_k(T).\n\nPlayer is on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t), so on freeway y_t.\n\nNow, for freeway 1, y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as 1? (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, the span is given as (tau, h), but in the update, it says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right-moving, direction right, so I think for consistency, head is the front when moving, so for right-moving, head should be larger, but in the input, for freeway 3, first car: (-24,-35,right,12), so h=-24, tau=-35? But -24 > -35, so if moving right, head at -24, tail at -35, which would mean the car is from x=-35 to x=-24, so head at -24, tail at -35? That seems backward.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the game dynamics, for left-moving: \"head at h, tail at tau\", and span [h, tau], with h decreasing, tau decreasing.\n\nFor right-moving: \"span(t1) = [tau, h]\", and it becomes [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\n\nSo for right-moving, when direction is right, the span is given as [tau, h], which might imply that tau is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, tau] with h left end, tau right end? In left-moving, if moving left, left end is head, right end is tail.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at tau.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, tau], and it moves left, so h decreases, tau decreases.\n\nIf moving left, head should be the front, which is smaller x, tail larger x.\n\nIn freeway 1, h=48, tau=83, so if moving left, head at 48, tail at 83, so the car spans from 48 to 83 at t1.\n\nAs it moves left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving, in freeway 3, (-24,-35,right,12), so h=-24, tau=-35, direction right.\n\nThen, for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] = [-35, -24]? But tau=-35, h=-24, so [tau, h] = [-35, -24], which is from -35 to -24.\n\nThen as it moves right, both increase: [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-35 +12(T-4), -24 +12(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nIn the span notation, for right-moving, it's [left end, right end] after movement? No.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h] which is [ -35, -24 ] for this car, then at T, [ -35 +12(T-4), -24 +12(T-4) ], so the left end increases, right end increases, so it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, tau] = [48,83], at T, [48-36(T-4), 83-36(T-4)], so both decrease, moves left.\n\nAnd collision if 0 in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nAlso, player at turn T is on y_T, so for freeway k, if y_T = k and 0 in span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, at turn T, the span is at that turn.\n\nAlso, when player moves, at turn T, after action, position is for turn T+1, so at turn T, player is on y_T, and we check for y_T.\n\nIf action at turn T is U, y_{T+1} = y_T +1, so at turn T, player is on y_T, and we check collision for freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, player is on y_{T+1}, check for that freeway at turn T+1, and so on.\n\nIf I move at turn T, I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, so I don't occupy y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision check for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nOnly for the freeway I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, s=36, span at T: [48 -36(T-4), 83-36(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (48,83,left,36), identical.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars, all right-moving, s=12.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) so span at t1: [tau, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [ -35 +12(T-4), -24 +12(T-4) ]\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12)? h=60, tau=49, but for right-moving, span [tau, h] = [49,60]? tau=49, h=60, so [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49 +12(T-4), 60 +12(T-4)]\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,12), span [13,24] at t1, at T: [13+12(T-4), 24+12(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (-42,-53,right,6), so one car, right-moving, s=6, span at t1: [tau, h] = [-53,-42]? tau=-53, h=-42, so [-53,-42]\n\nAt T: [-53 +6(T-4), -42 +6(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (-42,-53,right,6) and (24,13,right,6), so two cars.\n\nFirst: same as above, [-53,-42] at t1, at T: [-53+6(T-4), -42+6(T-4)]\n\nSecond: (24,13,right,6), span [13,24] at t1, at T: [13+6(T-4), 24+6(T-4)]\n\nNow, player starts at turn 4, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9. Since y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, as no freeways there, so only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the start and end, no cars, so safe.\n\nI need to move from y=2 to y=9, passing through y=3 to y=8, but avoiding collisions.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, but to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal H is at least the vertical distance, from y=2 to y=9, difference of 7, so at least 7 turns if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars, which might take more turns.\n\nBut with H turns, I can move up to H times, but I start at 2, need to reach 9, so net up 7, so with H turns, the number of U minus number of D must be 7, and y_t between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I can stay, but staying might be useful to wait.\n\nBut to minimize H, I probably want to go up as fast as possible with minimal waiting.\n\nFirst, let's find when each freeway is safe at different turns.\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if 0 is in the span of some car on k at T.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is not covered by any car.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the times when no car covers 0.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, span at T: [48 -36(T-4), 83-36(T-4)]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36(T-4) <= 0 <= 83-36(T-4)\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is shifting left.\n\nSet t = T - 4, so at relative time t.\n\nSpan: [48 -36t, 83-36t]\n\n0 in [48-36t, 83-36t] if 48-36t <= 0 and 0 <= 83-36t\n\n48-36t <=0 => 36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\n0 <= 83-36t => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSo for t in [4/3, 83/36] ≈ [1.333, 2.305], which is turns T=4+t, so T=5,6 since T integer.\n\nt=1: T=5, 48-36=12, 83-36=47, 12 to 47, 0 not in [12,47]\n\nt=2: T=6, 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, -24 to 11, 0 in [-24,11] yes.\n\nt=3: T=7, 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, -60 to -25, 0 not in.\n\nt=1.333: T=5.333, not integer.\n\nt=2.305: T=6.305, not integer.\n\nSo at T=5: span [12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=6: span [-24,11], 0 in, collision.\n\nT=7: span [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAnd for T<4, but we start from T=4, and t=0: T=4, span [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nT=4: t=0, [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe at T=6 only? T=6 is unsafe.\n\nT=5 safe, T=6 unsafe, T=7 safe.\n\nBut t=1.333 to 2.305, so for integer T, only T=6.\n\nT=5: t=1, [48-36=12, 83-36=47], 0 not in.\n\nT=6: t=2, [48-72=-24, 83-72=11], -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nT=7: t=3, [48-108=-60,83-108=-25], -60<= -25 <0, 0 not <= -25? -25 <0, so 0 not in [-60,-25].\n\nSimilarly, for other T.\n\nSo freeway 1: safe except at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is identical, so same: unsafe only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all s=12, right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) so span at T: [ -35 +12(T-4), -24 +12(T-4) ]\n\nSet t=T-4\n\nSpan: [ -35 +12t, -24 +12t ]\n\n0 in this if -35+12t <=0 and 0<= -24+12t\n\n-35+12t <=0 => 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈2.916\n\n0 <= -24+12t => 12t >=24 => t >=2\n\nSo t in [2, 35/12] ≈ [2, 2.916], so T=6,7? t=2: T=6, t=2.916: T=6.916\n\nT=6: t=2, [ -35+24= -11, -24+24=0 ], so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included? Since <=0 and >=0, so 0 in span.\n\n-11 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nT=7: t=3, [ -35+36=1, -24+36=12 ], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=5: t=1, [ -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12 ], [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for first car, unsafe at T=6.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12) h=60, tau=49, span [tau, h] = [49,60] at t1, at T: [49+12t, 60+12t]\n\n0 in [49+12t, 60+12t]? 49+12t >0 for t>=0, since 49>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in this span. Always safe for this car.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,12) span [13+12t, 24+12t] at T.\n\n13+12t >0 for t>=0, so 0 never in, safe.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the first car can cause collision, and only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5, same as 3, so unsafe only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, (-42,-53,right,6) s=6.\n\nSpan at T: [ -53 +6(T-4), -42 +6(T-4) ] = [ -53 +6t, -42 +6t ] with t=T-4\n\n0 in this if -53+6t <=0 and 0<= -42+6t\n\n-53+6t <=0 => 6t <=53 => t <= 53/6 ≈8.833\n\n0 <= -42+6t => 6t >=42 => t >=7\n\nSo t in [7, 53/6] ≈ [7, 8.833], so T=11,12? t=7: T=11, t=8.833: T=12.833\n\nT=11: t=7, [ -53+42= -11, -42+42=0 ], [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=12: t=8, [ -53+48= -5, -42+48=6 ], [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=13: t=9, [ -53+54=1, -42+54=12], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=10: t=6, [ -53+36= -17, -42+36= -6], [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for T=11 and T=12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 same as 6, unsafe at T=11,12.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (-42,-53,right,6), unsafe at T=11,12.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6), span [13+6t, 24+6t] at T.\n\n13+6t >0, so 0 never in, safe.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car matters, unsafe at T=11,12.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when unsafe:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=11,12\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=11,12\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=11,12\n\ny=2 is also unsafe at T=6? y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: same as y=1, unsafe at T=6.\n\nIn the list, freeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn 4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=0 safe.\n\nNow, the unsafe turns are clustered: at T=6 for y=1 to 5, and at T=11,12 for y=6 to 8.\n\nFor y=1 to 5, only unsafe at T=6, safe otherwise.\n\nFor y=6 to 8, unsafe at T=11 and 12, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, player at turn 4, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal vertical move is 7 steps up.\n\nBut I might need to avoid being on certain y at certain T.\n\nSpecifically, at T=6, if I am on y=1,2,3,4, or 5, I collide.\n\nAt T=11 or 12, if I am on y=6,7, or 8, I collide.\n\nSince I start at turn 4, and T=6 is soon, I need to not be on y=1-5 at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, for later, not on y=6-8 at turn 11 or 12.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn from turn 4.\n\nStart turn 4, y=2.\n\nTurn 4: action, but action at turn t affects position at turn t+1.\n\nPosition update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines Delta y_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nAt time t, position is y_t.\n\nFor turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nNow, at turn t=4, I am at y=2.\n\nI choose action a_4, which sets y_5.\n\nThen at turn 5, I am at y_5, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if I am on freeway y_t and 0 in span for that freeway at turn t.\n\nFor turn 4: y=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt turn 4, t=0 relative, freeway 2 span [48,83], 0 not in, safe. So no collision at start.\n\nNow, if I go up every turn:\n\nTurn 4: choose a_4 = U, then y_5 = y_4 +1 = 2+1=3\n\nAt turn 5: y=3, freeway 3. At T=5, t=1, freeway 3: we saw safe, no car covers 0. So safe.\n\nThen turn 5: choose a_5 = U, y_6 = y_5 +1 = 3+1=4\n\nAt turn 6: y=4, freeway 4. But at T=6, freeway 4 unsafe, as we saw, collision! Oh.\n\nSo if I go up on turn 5 to y=4 at turn 6, which is T=6, on y=4, collide.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I stay or go down to avoid.\n\nBut I need to not be on y=1-5 at turn 6.\n\nSince turn 6 is only unsafe for those y.\n\nNow, at turn 4, y=2.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nIf I go up at turn 4: y_5=3\n\nThen at turn 5, y=3, which is safe at T=5.\n\nThen I need to avoid y=1-5 at turn 6.\n\nSo at turn 5, I should not go up to y=4,5,6? y_6 depends on action at turn 5.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nAt turn 5, if I choose S, y_6 = y_5 =3\n\nBut y=3 at turn 6, which is unsafe, since y=3 is part of 1-5.\n\nIf I choose D, y_6 = y_5 -1 =3-1=2, still on y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose U, y_6=4, unsafe.\n\nSo no matter what I do at turn 5, if I am at y=3 at turn 5, y_6 will be 2,3, or 4, all unsafe at turn 6.\n\ny=2,3,4 all in 1-5, unsafe at T=6.\n\nSo if I go to y=3 at turn 5, I cannot avoid collision at turn 6, because whatever action I take, I end up on a y between 2 and 4 at turn 6, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can go to y=0 or y=6 or something, but from y=3, I can go to y=2,3,4.\n\ny=0 is safe, but at turn 6.\n\nIf at turn 5, I go down to y=2? But y=2 at turn 6 is unsafe.\n\nGo to y=4, unsafe.\n\nStay y=3, unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=3 at turn 5? Or rather, I need to be on a safe y at turn 6.\n\nSafe y at turn 6 are y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0,9 no freeway, safe.\n\ny=6,7,8: at T=6, are they safe? y=6 to 8 are unsafe only at T=11,12, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=6: freeway 6, at T=6, t=2, span [-53+12= -41? Earlier for freeway 6.\n\nt=T-4=2 for T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: span at T: [ -53 +6t, -42 +6t ]\n\nt=2, [ -53+12= -41, -42+12= -30 ], [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 same, safe at T=6.\n\ny=8 same, safe at T=6.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo at turn 6, safe y are y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nUnsafe are y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, back to turn 4: I am at y=2.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at turn 5, then at turn 5, I am at y=3, and I need to set y_6 to a safe value, but from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4, all unsafe at turn 6. Cannot reach y=6 or 0 directly.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at turn 6 if I go to y=3 at turn 5.\n\nTherefore, I should not go up at turn 4.\n\nIf I stay at turn 4: a_4=S, then y_5 = y_4 +0 =2\n\nAt turn 5, y=2.\n\nThen at turn 5, I need to choose action for y_6.\n\nIf I stay, y_6=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go up, y_6=3, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, y_6=1, which is also unsafe at turn 6.\n\ny=1 at turn 6 unsafe.\n\nSo all options unsafe, and I cannot reach safe y like 6 or 0 from here.\n\nIf I go down at turn 4: a_4=D, y_5=2-1=1\n\nAt turn 5, y=1.\n\nThen at turn 5, I can choose: S, y_6=1, unsafe.\n\nU, y_6=2, unsafe.\n\nD, y_6=0, which is safe.\n\ny=0 at turn 6 is safe.\n\nSo possible.\n\nThen I can go to y=0 at turn 6, avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to 9.\n\nBut y=0 might not be desirable, but it's safe.\n\nI could go to a higher y.\n\nBut from turn 4, if I go down to y=1 at turn 5, then down to y=0 at turn 6.\n\nThen I need to go up from 0 to 9.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince at turn 6, I need to be on y=0 or y=6-9.\n\ny=6-9 are high.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 4, how can I reach y=6 at turn 6?\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Delta y_5\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Delta y_4\n\ny_4=2.\n\nIf I go up twice: y_5=3, y_6=4, but y=4 unsafe at T=6.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I go up then down or something, but y_6 must be 4 if y_5=3 and up, etc., cannot jump.\n\nThe only way to be at y=6 at turn 6 is from y=5 or y=6 or y=7 at turn 5.\n\nBut at turn 5, y=5: freeway 5, at T=5, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 5 same as 3, at T=5, t=1, earlier for freeway 3: at T=5, first car span [-23,-12], 0 not in, other cars safe, so safe.\n\ny=5 at turn 5 is safe.\n\nBut from turn 4, y=2, I can go to y=3 at turn 5, but then from y=3, I can go to y=4 at turn 6, which is unsafe, or to y=2 or 3, also unsafe.\n\nI cannot reach y=5 or 6 from y=3 in one step? From y=3, y_6 can be 2,3,4 only.\n\nCannot reach y=5 or 6 directly.\n\nThe position change is only by ±1 or 0 per turn.\n\nSo from turn 5 to turn 6, y can change by at most 1.\n\nSimilarly from turn 4 to turn 5.\n\nSo from y=2 at turn 4, after one turn, y_5 can be 1,2,3.\n\nThen from there, y_6 can be, if y_5=1: y_6=0,1,2\n\nIf y_5=2: y_6=1,2,3\n\nIf y_5=3: y_6=2,3,4\n\nAll of these y_6 are between 0 and 4, which at turn 6, y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe y_6 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at turn 6, I must be at y=0 at turn 6.\n\nI have to go down to y=0 by turn 6.\n\nNow, at turn 4, y=2.\n\nI can go down directly or in steps.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: at turn 4, go down: a_4=D, then y_5 = 2-1=1\n\nAt turn 5, y=1, which is safe at T=5? Freeway 1 at T=5: t=1, span [48-36=12, 83-36=47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 5, go down: a_5=D, y_6=1-1=0, safe at turn 6.\n\nOption 2: at turn 4, stay: a_4=S, y_5=2\n\nAt turn 5, y=2, safe at T=5 (freeway 2 at T=5 similar, safe)\n\nThen at turn 5, go down: a_5=D, y_6=2-1=1, but y=1 at turn 6 unsafe! Not good.\n\nIf at turn 5 go down to y=1, unsafe.\n\nBut I need y_6=0.\n\nSo if I stay at turn 4, y_5=2, then at turn 5 I must go down to y_6=1, but y=1 unsafe at T=6.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf at turn 4 go down to y_5=1, then at turn 5 go down to y_6=0.\n\nThat works.\n\nIf at turn 4 go down to y_5=1, then at turn 5 stay, y_6=1, unsafe.\n\nMust go down at turn 5 to y_6=0.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up at turn 4, y_5=3, then I can only go to y=2,3,4 at turn 6, all unsafe, cannot reach 0.\n\nSo only possibility: go down at turn 4 to y=1 at turn 5, then down at turn 5 to y=0 at turn 6.\n\nSo actions: turn 4: D, turn 5: D.\n\nThen at turn 6, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nI am at turn 6, y=0.\n\nNow, I can start going up.\n\nBut there is another unsafe period at T=11,12 for y=6,7,8.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=6,7,8 at turn 11 or 12.\n\nTurn 11 and 12.\n\nNow, current turn: after turn 6, I am at turn 6.\n\nNow, from turn 6 onwards, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe distance: from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up.\n\nBut I might need to time it to avoid the later collision.\n\nFirst, let's list the turns: turn 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,etc.\n\nAt turn 11 and 12, if I am on y=6,7,8, collision.\n\nSo I need to not be on those y at those turns.\n\nNow, I can be on y=9 before or after, or on lower y.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nSimilarly, y=0-5 are safe at those times, except we have to see.\n\ny=0-5 are unsafe only at T=6, which is past, so from turn 7 onwards, y=1-5 are safe, since no other unsafe times mentioned.\n\nSimilarly, y=6-8 unsafe only at T=11,12.\n\nSo from turn 7 to 10, y=1-5 safe, y=6-8 also safe except at T=11,12.\n\ny=6-8 safe before T=11 and after T=12.\n\nAt T=11 and 12 unsafe.\n\nNow, I am at turn 6, y=0.\n\nI can go up.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal time: if I go up every turn from now.\n\nStart turn 6, y=0.\n\nTurn 6: choose a_6, set y_7.\n\nIf a_6=U, y_7=1\n\nTurn 7: y=1, safe (since T=7>6, y=1 safe)\n\na_7=U, y_8=2\n\nTurn 8: y=2, safe\n\na_8=U, y_9=3\n\nTurn 9: y=3, safe\n\na_9=U, y_10=4\n\nTurn 10: y=4, safe\n\na_10=U, y_11=5\n\nTurn 11: y=5, which is safe, since y=5 not unsafe at T=11, only y=6-8 unsafe.\n\ny=5 is fine.\n\nThen a_11=U, y_12=6\n\nBut at turn 12, y=6, which is unsafe at T=12.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at turn 11, I go up to y=6, but at turn 11, y=5, if I go up, y_12=6, which at turn 12 is unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 11 I stay, y_12=5, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt turn 10, y=4? Let's list the positions.\n\nTurn 6: y=0\n\na_6=U, y_7=1\n\nTurn 7: y=1, a_7=U, y_8=2\n\nTurn 8: y=2, a_8=U, y_9=3\n\nTurn 9: y=3, a_9=U, y_10=4\n\nTurn 10: y=4, now I need to set y_11.\n\nIf a_10=U, y_11=5\n\nTurn 11: y=5, which is safe. Now, at turn 11, I need to set y_12.\n\nIf I go up, a_11=U, y_12=6, but at turn 12, y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, a_11=S, y_12=5, safe, but then I am at y=5 at turn 12, not at 9.\n\nThen I need to continue up, but later.\n\nIf I go down, worse.\n\nBut at turn 12, y=5 safe, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, from y=5 at turn 12, I can go up, but turn 12 is unsafe for y=6,7,8, but if I go to y=6 at turn 13, that might be safe, since T=13>12.\n\nT=13 for y=6: freeway 6 at T=13, t=9, span [-53+54=1, -42+54=12], [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all safe after T=12 for y=6-8.\n\nUnsafe only at T=11 and 12.\n\nSo at turn 12, if I am on y=5, safe.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut let's see how many turns.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 10: 5 turns, y from 0 to 4? Turn 6 y=0, after a_6 U, y_7=1; ... up to turn 10 y=4.\n\nTurn: after action at turn t, y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn 10, after action, y_11.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn 6: position y=0, choose a_6\n\n- After a_6, y_7 set.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo at time turn t, position y_t.\n\nTurn 6: y_6 = 0\n\nChoose a_6: suppose U, then y_7 = 1\n\nTurn 7: y_7=1, choose a_7: U, y_8=2\n\nTurn 8: y_8=2, a_8: U, y_9=3\n\nTurn 9: y_9=3, a_9: U, y_10=4\n\nTurn 10: y_10=4, choose a_10.\n\nIf a_10=U, y_11=5\n\nTurn 11: y_11=5, choose a_11.\n\nIf a_11=U, y_12=6\n\nTurn 12: y_12=6, but at T=12, y=6 unsafe, collision.\n\nTo avoid, at turn 11, I can choose not to go to y=6 yet.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, y=4, I could stay or go down, but that delays.\n\nAt turn 11, y=5, I can stay: a_11=S, then y_12=5, safe at turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 12, y=5, I can go up: a_12=U, y_13=6\n\nTurn 13: y=6, now T=13, which is safe for y=6.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's count the turns from start.\n\nFirst, from turn 4 to 6: we have actions at turn 4 and 5 to go down to y=0 at turn 6.\n\nSo turns: turn 4: D, turn 5: D, then turn 6: y=0.\n\nNow from turn 6: we start going up.\n\nTo reach y=9.\n\nWith no waiting, if I go up every turn:\n\ny_7=1 (after a_6=U)\n\ny_8=2 (a_7=U)\n\ny_9=3 (a_8=U)\n\ny_10=4 (a_9=U)\n\ny_11=5 (a_10=U)\n\ny_12=6 (a_11=U) but y_12=6 at turn 12 unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at turn 11, I can stay: so a_11=S, then y_12=5\n\nThen a_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nThen at turn 16, y=9, reached.\n\nBut I started from turn 4, and we have actions from turn 4 to turn 15? Let's list the actions.\n\nActions: turn t for t=4 to the turn before reaching 9.\n\nAt turn H-1, y_H =9.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nSet t=4: y_4=2\n\nAfter actions, y_{t+1}\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T, and H is the number of actions from t=4 to T-1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, such that after H actions, position is (0,9).\n\nt1=4.\n\nSo actions from a_4 to a_{4+H-1}, and after that, at turn 4+H, y_{4+H} =9.\n\nBecause y_{t+1} after action a_t.\n\nSo with H actions, we reach at turn 4+H.\n\nNow, from above, we have:\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = D, so y_5 = 2-1=1\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = D, y_6 =1-1=0\n\nNow at turn 6, y=0.\n\nNow from here, to reach y=9, need to go up 9 times, but with possible waiting.\n\nMinimal actions: 9 ups, but we might need to wait to avoid T=11,12.\n\nNow, at turn 6, y=0.\n\nWe can go up on turns 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 to reach y=9 at turn 15? Let's see.\n\nIf no waiting:\n\na_6=U, y_7=1\n\na_7=U, y_8=2\n\na_8=U, y_9=3\n\na_9=U, y_10=4\n\na_10=U, y_11=5\n\na_11=U, y_12=6  // but at turn 12, y=6 unsafe\n\nProblem.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be at y=6,7,8 at turn 11 or 12.\n\nAt turn 11, y should not be 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly turn 12.\n\nNow, from the sequence above, if I go up every turn from turn 6:\n\nAt turn 11: y_11 = ? From y_7=1, y_8=2, y_9=3, y_10=4, y_11=5 (if a_10=U)\n\ny_11=5, which is not 6,7,8, so safe at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=5, I need to set y_12.\n\nIf I go up, y_12=6, but at turn 12, y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y_12=5, safe.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut y_12=5, then a_12=U, y_13=6, which is safe since T=13>12.\n\nThen continue.\n\nNow, let's list the actions from turn 6 onwards.\n\nTurn 6: y=0, choose a_6\n\na_6=U, y_7=1\n\nTurn 7: y=1, a_7=U, y_8=2\n\nTurn 8: y=2, a_8=U, y_9=3\n\nTurn 9: y=3, a_9=U, y_10=4\n\nTurn 10: y=4, a_10=U, y_11=5\n\nTurn 11: y=5, now safe. Choose a_11.\n\nTo avoid y_12=6, I set a_11=S, so y_12=5\n\nTurn 12: y=5, safe (since T=12, y=5 not unsafe)\n\nThen a_12=U, y_13=6\n\nTurn 13: y=6, safe (T=13)\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nNow at turn 16, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 6 to 15: a_6 to a_15, that's 10 actions? Turns: actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, that's 10 actions, y from 0 to 9, but with one stay, so 9 ups and one stay, 10 actions, y_16=9.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 16, 10 turns later, but actions from turn 6 to 15 inclusive.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=6 to t=15, that's 10 actions.\n\nBut starting from y=0, to y=9, minimal 9 actions, but we have an extra stay.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 before turn 11.\n\nBut from turn 6 y=0, to y=9, at least 9 steps, so earliest at turn 15.\n\nTurn 6 y=0, after 9 ups: y_7=1, y_8=2, ..., y_15=9.\n\ny_15=9 at turn 15.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 11, y_11= ? From y_7=1 (after a_6), y_8=2 (a_7), ..., let's list y_t:\n\nTurn 6: y=0\n\nAfter a_6=U: y_7=1\n\nAfter a_7=U: y_8=2\n\nAfter a_8=U: y_9=3\n\nAfter a_9=U: y_10=4\n\nAfter a_10=U: y_11=5\n\nAfter a_11=U: y_12=6  // unsafe if we do this\n\nBut y_12=6 at turn 12 unsafe.\n\nTo have y_11 and y_12 safe.\n\nIn the direct up, at turn 11, y=5, safe; but at turn 12, if we go to y=6, unsafe.\n\nWe need to have at turn 11 and 12, y not 6,7,8.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 11, y=5, which is fine.\n\nAt turn 12, we need y=5 or less or 9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nIf at turn 11, instead of staying, I go up but to y=6 only after turn 12.\n\nBut I have to be at y=5 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, if I go up, y_12=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y_12=5, safe.\n\nThen go up later.\n\nBut y=9 at turn 15 is achievable, but with y_12=5.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier? Turn 15 is the earliest possible from turn 6, since 9 steps up.\n\nTurn 6 to turn 15: 10 turns? Turn 6 to turn 15 inclusive is 10 positions, but actions from turn 6 to 14 for 9 ups? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nTo have y_T =9.\n\nFrom y_6=0, after k actions, y_{6+k} = y_6 + sum of Delta y from t=6 to t=6+k-1.\n\ny_{6+k} = y_6 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Delta y_{6+i}\n\ny_6=0, y_{6+k} =9, so sum of Delta y from t=6 to t=6+k-1 must be +9, with each Delta y in {-1,0,1}, so minimal k=9 actions, then y_{6+9} = y_{15} =9.\n\nWith k=9 actions from turn 6 to turn 14, y_{15}=9.\n\nActions: a_6 to a_{14}, 9 actions, y_{15}=9.\n\nSimilarly, with waiting, more actions.\n\nNow in the sequence:\n\nIf I use 9 ups: a_6 to a_{14} all U, then y_7=1, y_8=2, ..., y_{15}=9.\n\nNow, in this, at turn 11: y_{11} = ? From y_7=1 (t=7), y_8=2, y_9=3, y_10=4, y_11=5\n\nAt turn 12: y_{12}=6\n\nNow, turn 11: y=5, safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=6, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not have y=6 at turn 12.\n\nSince at turn 11 y=5, I must not go up at turn 11.\n\nI need to insert a stay or down somewhere.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so minimal actions.\n\nFrom turn 6 to reach y=9 at turn 15 with 9 actions, but I have to avoid turn 12 y=6.\n\nSo I need to delay the ascent or something.\n\nI can go up slower so that at turn 12, I am not at y=6.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point.\n\nSuppose at some turn before, I stay, so that at turn 12, I am still below.\n\nFor instance, if at turn 10, I stay instead of going up.\n\nTurn 10: y=4, if I stay, a_10=S, then y_11=4\n\nThen at turn 11, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_11=U, y_12=5\n\nTurn 12: y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nNow y_16=9, with one extra action (the stay), so 10 actions from turn 6 to 15? Let's count.\n\nActions from turn 6 to turn 15: a_6 to a_15, 10 actions, y_16=9.\n\nBut with 9 actions, y_15=9 possible, but unsafe at turn 12.\n\nWith the stay, we have y_16=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the first plan I had a stay at turn 11.\n\nBut with the stay at turn 10, I have y_11=4 and y_12=5, both safe.\n\nThen go up to y_13=6, etc., to y_16=9.\n\nBut I can have fewer actions? Minimal is 9, but not possible due to collision, so I need at least 10 actions from turn 6.\n\nSince I have to add one extra turn to avoid the collision.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster initially or something, but I can only go one step per turn, so no.\n\nOr, from y=0, I can go to y=6 directly? No, impossible.\n\nSo I think I need to take 10 actions from turn 6 to reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn when I reach.\n\nIn the sequence with a stay:\n\nFor example, all up except one stay.\n\nBut where to stay.\n\nTo have at turn 11 and 12, y not 6,7,8.\n\nIn the direct up sequence, at turn 11 y=5, turn 12 y=6.\n\nI need to avoid turn 12 y=6.\n\nSo if I stay at turn 11, then y_12=5, then I need to go up from there, so y_13=6, y_14=7, y_15=8, y_16=9, same as before.\n\nIf I stay earlier, say at turn 6: a_6=S, y_7=0\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=1\n\na_8=U, y_9=2\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\na_10=U, y_11=4\n\na_11=U, y_12=5\n\na_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nStill y_16=9 with 10 actions.\n\nAnd at turn 11 y=4, turn 12 y=5, both safe.\n\nThen y_13=6 at turn 13 safe, etc.\n\nBut I reached later.\n\nIn the first version without stay: with 9 actions, y_15=9, but unsafe at turn 12 if I go through y=6.\n\nBut at turn 12, I am at y=6 only if I go up at turn 11 from y=5.\n\nIf I can be at y=9 before turn 12, but from y=0 at turn 6, to y=9 at turn 15, turn 15 is after turn 12.\n\nTurn 12 is before.\n\nTurn 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15: turn 12 is the 7th turn from turn 6? Turn 6 to turn 12 is 7 turns later, but positions.\n\nAfter k steps from turn 6, at turn 6+k.\n\nAt turn 6+k, y_{6+k}\n\nWith k ups, y_{6+k} = k.\n\nTo have y_{6+k} =9, k=9, at turn 15.\n\nTurn 15 > turn 12, so at turn 12, y_{12} = 12-6 =6? y_t at turn t.\n\ny_6=0\n\ny_7=1 if up\n\n...\n\ny_{12} = y_11 + Delta y_11\n\nIf all previous up, y_11=5, then if up, y_12=6.\n\nCannot avoid unless I don't go up all the way.\n\nSo I must have y_12 <=5 or y_12=9, but y=9 not possible yet.\n\nSo y_12 <=5.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to 9, which takes at least 4 more ups, so from y_12=5, to y_16=9 with 4 ups.\n\nBut y_12=5 at turn 12, then y_13=6, etc. to y_16=9.\n\nTotal from turn 6: to reach y_12=5, that takes 6 ups? From y_6=0 to y_12=5, with some actions.\n\nMinimal to reach y=5 from y=0 in 6 turns? y_6=0, y_7=1, ..., y_11=5 with 5 ups, at turn 11 y=5.\n\nThen at turn 12, I can have y=5 (stay) or y=4 or y=6, but y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo y=5 at turn 12.\n\nThen from turn 12 y=5, to y=9, need 4 ups, at turn 16 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I reach y=5 earlier, but I can't, since only one step per turn.\n\nFor example, if at turn 6 I go up to y=1, etc., I cannot be at y=5 before turn 11 with all up.\n\ny_6=0, y_11=5 with 5 ups from t=6 to t=10: a_6 to a_10 U, y_11=5.\n\nThen y_12=5 or 4 or 6.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo inevitably, to avoid collision, I need to be at y<=5 at turn 12, and then reach y=9 at turn 16 or later.\n\nThus minimal from turn 6 is 10 actions to reach turn 16.\n\nNow back to the full sequence.\n\nFrom turn 4:\n\nWe have actions at turn 4 and 5: both D, to get to y=0 at turn 6.\n\nThen from turn 6 to turn 15: 10 actions to reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nTotal actions: from turn 4 to turn 15, that's 12 actions? Let's list.\n\nActions: a_4, a_5, a_6, ..., a_{15}\n\nThat's 12 actions, and y_{16}=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Turn 4: a_4 = D, y_5 = 2-1 =1\n\n- Turn 5: a_5 = D, y_6 =1-1=0\n\n- Turn 6: a_6 = U, y_7 =0+1=1\n\n- Turn 7: a_7 = U, y_8 =1+1=2\n\n- Turn 8: a_8 = U, y_9 =2+1=3\n\n- Turn 9: a_9 = U, y_10=3+1=4\n\n- Turn 10: a_10 = U, y_11=4+1=5\n\n- Turn 11: a_11 = S, y_12=5+0=5  (stay to avoid going to 6)\n\n- Turn 12: a_12 = U, y_13=5+1=6\n\n- Turn 13: a_13 = U, y_14=6+1=7\n\n- Turn 14: a_14 = U, y_15=7+1=8\n\n- Turn 15: a_15 = U, y_16=8+1=9\n\nNow at turn 16, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from turn 4 to turn 15: that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nIn this, at turn 11, we stay, so we have a S action.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer actions?\n\nFor example, from turn 6, if I can go up without the stay, but I have to avoid y=6 at turn 12.\n\nSince turn 12 must not be on 6,7,8, and at turn 11 y=5, if I could go to y=7 or something, but I can only go to 6 or stay.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 and stay longer, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 6 y=0, I could stay until after turn 12, but then I have to go up, and it takes more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the above seems efficient.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 12, y=5, which is fine, and we go up after.\n\nNow, but we have the unsafe at T=11,12 for y=6-8, but in this sequence, at turn 11, y=5 not on 6-8, safe; turn 12, y=5 safe.\n\nThen from turn 13, y=6,7,8 all safe since T=13>12.\n\nNow, but in the actions, I used a stay at turn 11.\n\nI could use the stay earlier to save or something, but I think it doesn't reduce H.\n\nFor example, if I stay at turn 10 instead.\n\nThen:\n\n- Turn 6: U, y_7=1\n\n- Turn 7: U, y_8=2\n\n- Turn 8: U, y_9=3\n\n- Turn 9: U, y_10=4\n\n- Turn 10: S, y_11=4  (stay)\n\n- Turn 11: U, y_12=5\n\n- Turn 12: U, y_13=6\n\n- Turn 13: U, y_14=7\n\n- Turn 14: U, y_15=8\n\n- Turn 15: U, y_16=9\n\nSame, y_16=9 with 10 actions from turn 6.\n\nAnd at turn 11 y=4, turn 12 y=5, both safe.\n\nBut I reached y_11=4 instead of 5, but same end.\n\nNow, in this case, from turn 10, I stayed, so at turn 11 y=4, then up to y_12=5, etc.\n\nBut still to y_16=9.\n\nNo savings.\n\nWith the stay at turn 11 as before, y_11=5, y_12=5, then to y_16=9.\n\nSame number.\n\nSo minimal H from start.\n\nNow, total actions: from turn 4 to turn 15, 12 actions, H=12.\n\nBut let's list all actions in order.\n\nThe sequence should be actions for turn t_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=4.\n\nSo actions: a_4, a_5, ..., a_{4+H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn 4+H.\n\nWith H=12, turn 4+12=16, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence I have a_4 to a_15, which is 12 actions, a_4, a_5, ..., a_15, that's 12 actions, indices from 4 to 15 inclusive, number is 15-4+1=12.\n\nThen y_{16}=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list each action per turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have a_11=S to stay at y=5 for turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 11, I could go down? No, worse.\n\nOr, another thought: can I go to y=9 before turn 12?\n\nFrom y=0 at turn 6, earliest y=9 at turn 15, which is after turn 12, so no.\n\nTurn 15 is after turn 12.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I had to go down to avoid turn 6.\n\nBut at turn 6, I am at y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6-8 before turn 11.\n\nFor example, from turn 6 y=0, if I go up fast, I can be at y=8 at turn 14, but at turn 11 and 12, I might be on y=6-8.\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn:\n\ny_7=1, y_8=2, y_9=3, y_10=4, y_11=5, y_12=6, y_13=7, y_14=8, y_15=9.\n\nAt turn 11: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 12: y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at turn 10, but from y=0 at turn 6, to y=8 at turn 10: y_7=1, y_8=2, y_9=3, y_10=4 with 4 ups? y_10=4, not 8. Impossible to reach y=8 by turn 10.\n\nMax at turn 10 is y=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be high before turn 11.\n\nSo I think the sequence with one stay is necessary.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nAs above:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S  (stay to avoid going to 6 at turn 12)\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nThen at turn 16, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 11: S, so at turn 11, y=5, stay, so y_12=5.\n\nThen turn 12: U to y_13=6, etc.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions for each turn starting from t_1=4.\n\nThe actions are from turn 4 to turn 15, 12 actions.\n\nBut in the box, list each turn and action.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something: in the beginning, when I go down, at turn 5, I am at y=1, which is safe, and I go down to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, another thing: at the later part, when I go through y=6,7,8 after turn 12, it should be safe.\n\nBut let me confirm for y=6 at turn 13.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=13, t=9, span [-53 +6*9, -42 +6*9] = [-53+54=1, -42+54=12], [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=7,8 same.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly without the stay by choosing different path, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, if from turn 6, I go up to y=5 by turn 11, but same as before.\n\nOr, I could go down to y=0 at turn 6, but then go up immediately, same.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the turns: from turn 4 to reach turn 16, 12 turns later, but actions over 12 turns? No.\n\nStart at turn 4, after 0 actions, position at turn 4.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 5, and so on, after H actions, at turn 4+H.\n\nWith H=12, turn 16.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have 12 actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is a_4\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_5\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{4+H-1}\n\nSince H=12, last action at turn 4+12-1=15, which is a_15.\n\nAnd after that, at turn 16, position (0,9).\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nAs listed:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 11 is S, which is stay.\n\nBut in the action, S is allowed.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and I have H=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down to y=0, perhaps I can go up to higher y before turn 6.\n\nBut earlier, from turn 4, I cannot reach y=6 by turn 6.\n\ny_6 must be 0 to avoid collision.\n\nSince only y=0 is safe at turn 6 from low positions.\n\ny=6 is safe but I cannot reach it.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at turn 4, to y=6 at turn 6: need y_5 and y_6.\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Delta y_4, if U, y_5=3\n\nThen y_6 = y_5 + Delta y_5, from 3, max y_6=4, cannot reach 6.\n\nIf other actions, worse.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at turn 6.\n\nThus, must go to y=0.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is minimal.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions must account for the unsafe conditions at specific turns:\n\n- At turn 6, freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(5\\) are unsafe due to car collisions.\n- At turns 11 and 12, freeways \\(y = 6\\) to \\(8\\) are unsafe due to car collisions.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n1. Moving down to \\(y = 0\\) by turn 6 to avoid the collision at turn 6 on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(5\\).\n2. Moving up from \\(y = 0\\) starting at turn 6, but including a stay action at turn 11 to avoid being on freeways \\(y = 6\\) to \\(8\\) at turn 12.\n3. Continuing up to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 16.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 4**: Action \\(D\\) (down), moving to \\(y_5 = 1\\).\n- **Turn 5**: Action \\(D\\) (down), moving to \\(y_6 = 0\\).\n- **Turn 6**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_7 = 1\\).\n- **Turn 7**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_8 = 2\\).\n- **Turn 8**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_9 = 3\\).\n- **Turn 9**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_{10} = 4\\).\n- **Turn 10**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_{11} = 5\\).\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(S\\) (stay), remaining at \\(y_{12} = 5\\) to avoid moving to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12 (unsafe).\n- **Turn 12**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_{13} = 6\\) (now safe as turn 13 > 12).\n- **Turn 13**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_{14} = 7\\).\n- **Turn 14**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y_{15} = 8\\).\n- **Turn 15**: Action \\(U\\) (up), reaching \\(y_{16} = 9\\).\n\nAfter 12 actions (from turn 4 to turn 15), the position at turn 16 is (0, 9), achieving the goal with minimal turns while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). Note that y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (where k = y_T) and at that turn, for a car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: when moving from freeway y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on freeway y_T. So we only check the car on freeway y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on freeway y_{T+1} and we check cars on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nGiven car state at turn t1=5:\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8) and each car on it, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the update rules:\n\nLeft-moving: at turn t1, span is [h, τ] (so h is the right end, τ is the left end). Then at time T>t1, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nRight-moving: at turn t1, span is [τ, h] (so τ is the left end, h is the right end). Then at time T>t1, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are at turn t1=5. We are going to simulate turns starting at t1.\n\nWe start at (0,1) at turn 5.\n\nGoal: get to (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T when there is a car on freeway k at T such that 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nWe note that the player's x is always 0, so we only care about the car spans that cover 0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway and each car, the times when that car covers 0? But note: we are at turn 5, and we are going to plan from turn 5 onward.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=1 to y=9 without colliding, in minimal H.\n\nWe can use BFS? But note the state is the turn number and the y position, and the time can go up? However, note that the cars move linearly and we can compute the car positions at any future turn.\n\nBut the state space is small: y in [0,9] and time? But time can be unbounded? However, we want minimal H, so we can do BFS in (y, t) where t is the turn (starting at t1=5) and we stop when we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: the car positions change with time, so for each state (y, t) we can check if at turn t, being on freeway y is safe? But we also have to consider the actions: we move at turn t to the next y at turn t+1? Actually, at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). We choose an action a_t which determines y_{t+1}. But note:\n\n- At turn t, we are on freeway y_t. We must check that at turn t, the car on freeway y_t (if any) does not have a span that includes 0.\n\n- Then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and then at turn t+1, we are on freeway y_{t+1} and must check that freeway at turn t+1.\n\nSo the state for BFS: (t, y) meaning at turn t we are at y. Then we choose an action a_t which leads to state (t+1, y') where y' = y, y+1, or y-1 (clamped to [0,9]).\n\nBut note: at the state (t, y) we must first check that being at (t, y) is safe? Actually, the check for collision at (t, y) is done at the moment we are at that state.\n\nBut note: when we start at turn 5, we are at (5,1). We must check that at turn 5, being on freeway 1 is safe? Then we choose an action for turn 5, which will determine y at turn 6.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nLet t0 = 5, initial y0 = 1.\n\nWe want to find the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t0 + H - 1? Actually, the sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1 (H actions) and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at y=9? But note:\n\n- We start at turn t1=5, at position y=1.\n- After H turns (i.e., after applying H actions), we are at turn t1+H, and we require that at that turn we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1 + H - 1? Let me read:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we have the new state? Actually, after applying action at turn t, we get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo: \n- At turn t1 (5): we are at y1 = 1.\n- We apply action a_{5} -> then at turn 6 we are at y6 = y5 + delta.\n- ... \n- After applying the last action at turn t1+H-1 (which is 5+H-1), we get at turn t1+H (5+H) the position y_{5+H}. We want y_{5+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the number of actions? And then we must output the actions for turns 5 to 5+H-1.\n\nAnd at turn 5+H, we are at (0,9). So we require that at turn 5+H, we are at y=9.\n\nBut also, during the entire sequence, at every turn t from 5 to 5+H-1, we are at a position (0, y_t) and we must not collide at that turn? And note that at turn 5+H, when we are at y=9, we must also not collide? Because we are on freeway 9 at turn 5+H? But wait, freeways are only 1 to 8? The problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So freeway 9? There is no freeway 9? Actually, the grid has y=0 to 9, but the freeways (with cars) are only y=1 to 8. So when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? So no collision possible.\n\nTherefore, we only need to avoid collisions when we are on freeways 1 to 8. And when we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo in particular, at the goal state (turn 5+H, y=9): we are safe.\n\nBut during the journey, when we are on freeways 1 to 8 at turn t, we must check for collision at that turn.\n\nNow, we need to compute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of times when the car's span includes 0.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving continuously? Actually, the span is a contiguous interval of integers? The problem says the span is given as integers (head and tail) and they move by integer speeds. So we can compute for any integer turn T, the span.\n\nWe are starting at turn 5. We are going to simulate turns T from 5 onward.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the time intervals (if any) during which 0 is in the car's span. But note: since the cars move at constant speed, the car will cover 0 periodically? Actually, the car moves linearly, so it might cover 0 at a contiguous interval of time? Or at discrete times? Actually, the span at time T is a set of integers? The problem doesn't specify if the positions are integers? The head and tail are integers, and the speed is integer, so the positions are integers at every integer turn. And the span is a contiguous interval of integers.\n\nBut note: the update is linear: for a left-moving car: \n  left_end(T) = h - s*(T-5)\n  right_end(T) = τ - s*(T-5)   ??? \n\nWait, the initial span at turn 5 is [h, τ] for left-moving. But note: if the car is left-moving, then at turn 5, the head (which is the rightmost) is at h, and the tail (leftmost) at τ. Then at time T, the entire car moves left by s*(T-5). So:\n  right_end(T) = h - s*(T-5)\n  left_end(T) = τ - s*(T-5)\n\nBut note: because the car moves left, the right end decreases and the left end decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: \n  left_end(T) = τ + s*(T-5)\n  right_end(T) = h + s*(T-5)\n\nAnd the span is the set of integers from left_end(T) to right_end(T) (inclusive).\n\nWe then check if 0 is between left_end(T) and right_end(T) (inclusive).\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the set of T (turn numbers) for which the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: since the car is a contiguous segment, and it moves at constant speed, the set of T for which 0 is in the span is a contiguous interval? Or two intervals? Actually, it can be one contiguous interval? Because the car moves linearly and the segment is contiguous. As the car moves, the segment slides along the x-axis. So the time during which 0 is covered is a contiguous interval? \n\nLet me check: \n\nFor a left-moving car: \n  0 is covered at T if:\n  left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T)\n  => τ - s*(T-5) <= 0 <= h - s*(T-5)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n  τ - s*(T-5) <= 0   =>   τ <= s*(T-5)   =>   T-5 >= τ/s   => T >= 5 + ceil(τ/s) ? But note: τ and s are integers, so we can do integer arithmetic.\n\nActually, we have:\n\n  left_end(T) = τ - s*(T-5) <= 0\n  and \n  right_end(T) = h - s*(T-5) >= 0\n\nBut note: the inequalities:\n\n  τ - s*(T-5) <= 0   =>   T-5 >= ceil(τ/s)   if s>0? Actually, we can write:\n\n  T-5 >= (τ) / s   [if s>0, then this is T>=5+τ/s] but since T is integer and the values are integers, we can compute:\n\n  The condition is:\n      left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T)\n\n  =>  τ - s*(T-5) <= 0 and h - s*(T-5) >= 0\n\n  =>  s*(T-5) >= τ   and   s*(T-5) <= h\n\n  =>  T-5 >= ceil(τ/s)   and   T-5 <= floor(h/s)   ??? \n\nBut note: because τ and h are integers and s is integer, we can write:\n\n  Let d = T-5, then we need:\n      τ <= s*d <= h\n\nBut note: for a left-moving car, we have τ <= h? Actually, the initial span at T=5 is [h, τ] but the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\" and then moves to [h-s*d, τ-s*d]. And note: since the car is moving left, we must have h >= τ? Actually, the head is the starting right end, and tail the left end, so h should be >= τ.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] and then [τ+s*d, h+s*d], so we must have τ<=h.\n\nSo in both cases, the car is defined by two integers: L (left end) and R (right end) at time T, and L<=R.\n\nBut in the data, for left-moving: at T=5, L = τ, R = h (so τ<=h). Then at time T: \n  L(T) = τ - s*(T-5)\n  R(T) = h - s*(T-5)\n\nFor right-moving: at T=5, L=τ, R=h, then at time T:\n  L(T) = τ + s*(T-5)\n  R(T) = h + s*(T-5)\n\nSo condition for covering 0: L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nFor left-moving:\n  τ - s*(T-5) <= 0  and  h - s*(T-5) >= 0\n  => s*(T-5) >= τ   and  s*(T-5) <= h\n\nFor right-moving:\n  τ + s*(T-5) <= 0  and  h + s*(T-5) >= 0   ??? \n\nWait, that's not symmetric. Actually, the condition is 0 must be between L(T) and R(T). For right-moving:\n\n  L(T) = τ + s*(T-5) \n  R(T) = h + s*(T-5)\n\n  So: \n      τ + s*(T-5) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-5)\n\n  =>  two inequalities:\n      τ + s*(T-5) <= 0   => s*(T-5) <= -τ   => T-5 <= floor(-τ/s)   [if s>0]\n      and \n      0 <= h + s*(T-5)   => s*(T-5) >= -h   => T-5 >= ceil(-h/s)\n\nBut note: the signs matter. Let me do it with integers.\n\nWe can compute for each car the set of T for which 0 is in [L(T), R(T)] by solving the inequalities.\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate from T=5 onward, and we want minimal H, so we don't need to go too far. The minimal H is at least 8 (since we start at y=1 and need to go to y=9, and we can move at most 1 per turn) but we might have to wait sometimes, so H might be more than 8.\n\nWe can do BFS in the state (t, y) for t>=5 and y in [0,9]. We start at (5,1). We want to reach (t,9) for some t. Since we want minimal H (number of turns from t1=5 to the turn when we reach 9), we can use BFS that expands (t,y) to (t+1, y-1), (t+1,y), (t+1,y+1) if the move is valid (y remains in [0,9]) and provided that:\n\n1. At state (t,y): if y is in [1,8] (freeway), then we must check that at turn t, for every car on freeway y, 0 is NOT in the car's span. If there is at least one car on freeway y that covers 0 at turn t, then we cannot be at (t,y).\n\n2. Also, when we move to (t+1, y'), we require that at turn t, the action is chosen such that the move is possible? Actually, the only constraint is that y' must be in [0,9]. And we check the state (t,y) for collision? Then we check the next state (t+1,y') at its own turn.\n\nBut note: at the current state (t,y) we check collision for freeway y at turn t. Then we choose an action that leads to y' at turn t+1, and then at state (t+1,y') we check collision for freeway y' at turn t+1.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nLet queue = deque([(5,1, path)]) where path is the list of actions so far (or we can store the path separately). We want minimal H, so BFS by time.\n\nWe start at time 5, y=1. We check: is (5,1) safe? \n  Freeway 1: has one car: (12,47, left, 36). \n    Left-moving: so at T=5: \n        L(5)= τ = 47? Wait, the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n    For freeway 1: (12,47, left, 36) -> but wait, the head is 12, tail is 47? That doesn't make sense because for left-moving, the head (right end) should be greater than tail (left end). But here head=12, tail=47? 12<47? That would imply the head is at 12 and tail at 47? That would be a car from 12 to 47? Then moving left? But then the head should be the rightmost? So if the car is at [12,47] (so from 12 to 47) then the right end is 47 and the left end is 12? \n\nI think there is a confusion. The problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h-s*(T-t1), τ-s*(T-t1)]. \n\nBut if h=12 and τ=47, then at T=5, the span is [12,47]. But then moving left, at T=6: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11]. \n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: the head is at h and tail at τ. Typically, the head is the front? But the direction is left, so the front is the leftmost? Or the rightmost? \n\nThe update rule: \n  Left-moving: new span = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut if the car is moving left, then the entire segment shifts left. So the left end becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the right end becomes τ - s*(T-t1)? Then we must have h <= τ? Because otherwise the interval would be [h,τ] with h>τ, which is backwards.\n\nLooking at the data: \n  Freeway 1: (12,47, left, 36) -> h=12, τ=47. Then the initial span [12,47] is from 12 to 47? Then moving left: so at T=6: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]. \n\nBut then the condition for covering 0: \n  At T=5: [12,47] -> 0 is not in [12,47]? So safe at T=5.\n\nHowever, the representation: [h,τ] for left-moving: if h=12 and τ=47, then the car is from 12 to 47? But that is a segment of length 36? (47-12+1=36). And the speed is 36? Then at the next turn, it moves by 36 to the left: so the entire car shifts by 36? Then at T=6, it is from 12-36=-24 to 47-36=11. So 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes.\n\nBut the problem says: \"head h, tail τ\". In a left-moving car, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) would be the leftmost part? But here the update rule subtracts the same amount from both, so the head (h) is the right end? Because at T=5, the right end is h=12, and after moving left, the right end becomes 12-36=-24? That doesn't make sense because the right end should become 12-36=-24? Then the car is from -24 to 11? Then the left end is -24 and the right end is 11? So the head at T=5 was 12 (right end) and at T=6 the right end is -24? That is consistent with moving left by 36.\n\nSo the head is the right end for a left-moving car? And the tail is the left end? Then yes, the head is the right end and the tail the left end. So the initial segment is [tail, head] = [τ, h] but the problem writes it as (h, τ) and then the span is [h, τ]? That would be [head, tail] = [right end, left end]? But then [h,τ] with h=12, τ=47 is [12,47] meaning from 12 to 47? That is the same as [left end, right end] if we interpret 12 as the left and 47 as the right? \n\nBut the problem says: for left-moving, the span is [h, τ]. And then the update: [h-s*d, τ-s*d]. \n\nBut if h=12 and τ=47, then [12,47] is the initial span? Then after moving left by 36: [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11]. \n\nSo the car is from -24 to 11? Then 0 is in that interval? \n\nBut the problem states: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h-s*d, τ-s*d]. \n\nThis notation [a,b] might be interpreted as the set of integers from a to b inclusive. But if a<=b, then [a,b] is increasing. But if a>b, then it would be empty? So we assume that for a left-moving car, we have h>=τ? Actually, in the data: freeway1: (12,47, left,36) -> but 12<47, so h<τ? That contradicts the update? Because if we write [h,τ] and h<τ, then it's the same as [τ, h] if we interpret as min to max? \n\nBut the problem says: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\", and then for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\". \n\nBut if the car is moving left, the head (front) should be the leftmost? But then the head should be less than the tail? \n\nI think there is an inconsistency. Let me check the update: \n  Left-moving: new span = [h - s*d, τ - s*d]. \n\nIf the car is moving left, then both endpoints decrease. So if we start at [h,τ] and then become [h-s*d, τ-s*d], then if h>τ, then the interval [h,τ] would be from τ to h? (if h>τ, then [h,τ] is backwards). \n\nLooking at the data: \n  freeway 1: (12,47, left,36) -> if we interpret [h,τ] as [12,47] (so from 12 to 47) then the car is 36 units long? (47-12+1=36) and the speed is 36, so it moves 36 per turn. Then at T=5: [12,47] -> 0 not covered? \n  At T=6: [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes.\n\nBut the problem says: \"head h, tail τ\". Here, the head is 12 and tail is 47? Then the head is the front? But if the car is moving left, the front is the leftmost? Then the head should be the leftmost? But 12 is less than 47? So that would be consistent: head (left end) at 12, tail (right end) at 47. Then the update: [h-s*d, τ-s*d] = [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]. \n\nSo the head becomes -24 and the tail becomes 11. \n\nSo the representation: (head, tail, direction, speed) and the initial span is [head, tail]? But if the car is left-moving, then head is the left end? And tail is the right end? Then the initial segment is [head, tail] = [12,47] meaning from 12 to 47? Then the length is 36? \n\nBut the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\". It doesn't specify the order. But the update subtracts the same amount from both. So we must assume that the head and tail are such that the car is the contiguous segment from min(head,tail) to max(head,tail)? \n\nBut in the data, for freeway 3, we have: \n  (-12, -23, right, 12): \n  Here, head=-12, tail=-23. For a right-moving car, the update: [τ + s*d, h + s*d] = [-23+12*d, -12+12*d]. \n\nBut if we interpret the segment as [min, max]? Then the initial segment is from -23 to -12? Then the car is 12 units long? (from -23 to -12: 12 units) and speed 12. Then at T=5: [-23,-12]? Then 0 is not in there? \n\nBut the problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\". So if τ=-23, h=-12, then [τ, h] = [-23,-12]. Then at T=6: [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]. So 0 is covered at T=6.\n\nBut note: [τ, h] = [-23,-12] -> this is the same as [min(τ,h), max(τ,h)]? Because -23<-12, so the segment is from -23 to -12. \n\nSo it seems that the representation is: \n  For a car: (head, tail) and direction. \n  The initial segment is:\n      if left-moving: [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? \n      or as given: [h, τ] for left-moving and [τ, h] for right-moving? \n\nBut in the left-moving example: (12,47) -> [12,47] and then becomes [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11]. \n  And for the right-moving: (head=-12, tail=-23) -> [τ, h] = [-23,-12] and then becomes [-23+12, -12+12]=[-11,0] at T=6.\n\nBut in the freeway 3, there are three cars: \n  (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFor the third car: (36,25,right,12): \n  Then [τ, h] = [25,36] -> so from 25 to 36? Then at T=5: [25,36] -> 0 not in. \n  Then at T=6: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut for the first car: (-12,-23,right,12) -> becomes at T=6: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> covers 0 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (-48,-59,right,12): \n  [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Because τ=-59, h=-48? Then at T=5: [-59,-48] -> 0 not in.\n  At T=6: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, at T=6, the first car covers 0.\n\nNow, we are at turn 5, at freeway 1: we must check freeway 1 at T=5.\n\nFreeway 1: car (12,47,left,36): \n  Left-moving: span at T=5: [12,47] -> 0 not in? So safe.\n\nBut note: the data says for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) -> and we have only one car.\n\nSo at T=5, freeway1 is safe.\n\nThen we can start.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of turns T (>=5) for which there is a car on freeway k that covers 0 at T.\n\nBut note: multiple cars on a freeway: if any one covers 0 at T, then the freeway is unsafe at T.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k, the set of T where freeway k is unsafe.\n\nWe can do:\n\nunsafe[k] = set()   # set of turns T where freeway k has a car that covers 0.\n\nBut T can be large? But we are going to do BFS until we reach y=9, and minimal H. Since we can only move up/down one per turn, the minimal H is 8 (if we go up every turn: 1->2->3->...->9: 8 moves). But we might have to wait. So we don't need to go beyond, say, 5+20? We'll set a limit.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each car the interval of T for which it covers 0, then union per freeway.\n\nBut let's compute for each car:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car: (12,47,left,36)\n  Left-moving: condition: \n      L(T) = 12 - 36*(T-5)   [because head=12, so the right end? But we determined the segment is [12,47] at T=5, so left end=12, right end=47? \n      Actually, we established that the car is from 12 to 47?

But if we are forced to avoid an unsafe time, we might go down to 0? which is safe (no freeway) and then come back.\n\nBut note: minimal H, so we prefer going up.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nLevel 0 (turn5): state (5,1) -> safe.\n\nThen we can do: U -> (6,2)\n             S -> (6,1)\n             D -> (6,0)\n\nBut at turn6, we must check the state (6,y) for y in {0,1,2}:\n\nFor (6,0): safe (since freeway0 doesn't exist, so always safe).\nFor (6,1): unsafe? freeway1 at T=6 is unsafe -> so (6,1) is unsafe -> discard.\nFor (6,2): freeway2 at T=6: unsafe? yes, because freeway2 is same as freeway1: unsafe at T=6 -> discard.\n\nSo from (5,1), the only safe next state is (6,0) by action D.\n\nThen at (6,0): \n  Actions: \n    U -> (7,1)\n    S -> (7,0)\n    D -> (7,-1) -> invalid (y must be>=0) -> so not allowed.\n\nAt turn7, state (7,0): safe? yes (y=0 is safe).\nAt turn7, state (7,1): check freeway1 at T=7: we computed safe? yes (car at freeway1 at T=7: [-60,-25] -> 0 not in).

We can go up to (8,2).\n\nThen at (8,2): \n  Then we can go to (9,3) by U.\n\nAt turn9: \n  (9,3): freeway3 at T=9: unsafe? yes, we computed freeway3 unsafe at T=9 -> so (9,3) unsafe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can go to (9,2) by S, or (9,1) by D.\n\n  (9,2): freeway2 at T=9: we computed freeway2 safe at T=9? \n        freeway2: same as freeway1: at T=9: [12-36*4,47-36*4]=[12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n        so (9,2) safe.\n\n  (9,1): freeway1 at T=9: safe? same as above: [-132,-97] -> safe.\n\n  (9,0): safe.\n\nSo from (8,2), we can do D -> (9,1) or S-> (9,2) or U-> (9,3) [but unsafe].\n\nBut we want to go up. Alternatively, we can wait at (7,1) by going S to (8,1), then from (8,1) we can go U to (9,2) or S to (9,1) or D to (9,0).\n\nBut we need to get to 9, so we have to go up eventually.\n\nLet me try to go from (7,1) to (8,1) by S, then from (8,1) to (9,2) by U.\n\nThen at (9,2): safe.\n\nThen from (9,2) we can go to (10,3) by U.\n\nAt turn10, freeway3: we computed safe? \n        freeway3 at T=10: \n          car1: [-23+12*5, -12+12*5] = [37,48] -> safe.\n          car2: [-59+12*5, -48+12*5]= [1,12] -> safe? 0 not in.\n          car3: [25+12*5,36+12*5]=[85,96] -> safe.\n        so safe.\n\nSo (10,3) is safe.\n\nThen we can go: \n  (10,3) -> U -> (11,4) \n  (10,3) -> S -> (10,3) -> but we don't want to stay? \n  (10,3) -> D -> (11,2) \n\nBut we want to go up.\n\nAt (11,4): freeway4 at T=11: \n        freeway4: same as freeway3? but wait, we have separate freeways. \n        freeway4: cars: same as freeway3: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n        at T=11: \n          car1: [-23+12*6, -12+12*6] = [49,60] -> safe.\n          car2: [-59+12*6, -48+12*6]= [13,24] -> safe.\n          car3: [25+12*6,36+12*6]=[97,108] -> safe.\n        so safe.\n\nBut note: freeway4 is safe at T=11? yes.\n\nHowever, we also have freeway6,7,8 unsafe at T=11? but we are at freeway4, so we only check freeway4. So (11,4) is safe.\n\nThen we can go from (11,4) to (12,5) by U.\n\nAt turn12, freeway5: \n        freeway5: same as freeway3? \n        at T=12: \n          car1: [-23+12*7, -12+12*7] = [61,72] -> safe.\n          car2: [-59+12*7, -48+12*7]= [25,36] -> safe.\n          car3: [25+12*7,36+12*7]=[109,120] -> safe.\n        so safe.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway5, which is safe at T=12.\n\nBut freeway6,7,8 are unsafe at T=12, but we are at 5, so no problem.\n\nThen from (12,5) we can go to (13,6) by U.\n\nAt turn13, freeway6: \n        we computed freeway6 at T=13: safe? \n        freeway6: car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> at T=13: [-47+6*8, -36+6*8]= [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo (13,6) safe.\n\nThen (13,6) -> U -> (14,7): \n        freeway7 at T=14: \n            freeway7: car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> at T=14: [-47+6*9, -36+6*9] = [-47+54, -36+54]=[7,18] -> safe? 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen (14,7) -> U -> (15,8): \n        freeway8 at T=15: \n            car1: (-36,-47,right,6) -> at T=15: [-47+6*10, -36+6*10]=[13,24] -> safe.\n            car2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+6*10,30+6*10]=[79,90] -> safe.\n        so safe.\n\nThen (15,8) -> U -> (16,9): goal.\n\nBut we started at turn5, and we reached turn16? That is 11 turns? But we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster.\n\nBut earlier we had to detour to 0 at turn6 because turn6 was unsafe at y=1 and y=2.\n\nWhat if we wait at y=0 for one more turn? \n\nAt (6,0) we did U to (7,1). But we could also stay at (6,0) and then at turn7 go to (7,0) by S? Then at turn7, we are at (7,0). Then we can go to (8,1) by U at turn7.\n\nBut then at (8,1): safe? freeway1 at T=8: safe.\n\nThen from (8,1) we can go to (9,2) by U.\n\nAt (9,2): safe (as above).\n\nThen same as before: \n  (9,2) -> U to (10,3) [safe at T=10]\n  (10,3) -> U to (11,4) [safe at T=11: freeway4 safe? yes]\n  (11,4) -> U to (12,5) [freeway5 safe at T=12: yes]\n  (12,5) -> U to (13,6) [freeway6 safe at T=13: yes]\n  (13,6) -> U to (14,7) [freeway7 safe at T=14: [7,18] -> safe]\n  (14,7) -> U to (15,8) [freeway8 safe at T=15: [13,24] and [79,90] -> safe]\n  (15,8) -> U to (16,9)\n\nSame 11 actions.\n\nBut we started at turn5, so actions from turn5 to turn15 (inclusive) -> 11 actions: turns 5,6,...,15 -> 11 turns? H=11.\n\nBut we can do better? \n\nWhat if we avoid the detour to 0? \n\nAt turn5: (5,1) safe.\n\nWe cannot go to (6,1) or (6,2) because they are unsafe at T=6.\n\nBut what about going to (6,0) as we did? Then from (6,0) we go to (7,1) and then we are at turn7.\n\nBut then we are at (7,1). Then we can go to (8,2) by U? \n  (8,2): freeway2 at T=8: safe? we computed freeway2 safe at T=8: [12-36*3,47-36*3]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen from (8,2) we can go to (9,3) by U? but (9,3) is unsafe at T=9 (freeway3 unsafe).\n\nSo we cannot go to (9,3). Then we can go to (9,2) by S? \n  (9,2): freeway2 at T=9: safe? [12-36*4,47-36*4]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n\nThen from (9,2) we go to (10,3) by U? \n  (10,3): freeway3 at T=10: safe? yes.\n\nThen we go up: \n  (10,3)-> (11,4): freeway4 at T=11: safe? yes.\n  (11,4)-> (12,5): freeway5 at T=12: safe? yes.\n  (12,5)-> (13,6): freeway6 at T=13: safe?

Then we go to y=3 at turn10. But we lost a turn by going down at turn5.\n\nAlternatively, can we go up at turn5? We cannot because turn6 at y=1 or y=2 is unsafe.\n\nWhat if we stay at turn5? \n  At (5,1): we can choose S -> (6,1) -> unsafe -> discard.\n\nSo we must move down to 0 at turn6.\n\nBut then at turn7, we are at y=1. Then we go to y=2 at turn8. Then we are stuck at y=2 at turn9? because if we go up to y=3 at turn9, we collide. So we have to wait at y=2 for turn9 to pass? \n\nAt (8,2): we can choose to stay at y=2 for turn9? \n  (9,2) is safe, as we said.\n\nThen we are at (9,2).

That is the same as before.\n\nOr at turn9 we are at y=2, then at turn10 we go to y=3, then turn11 to y=4.\n\nBut we want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nAnother idea: at turn5: y=1 -> D to turn6: y=0.\nThen at turn6: y=0 -> U to turn7: y=1.\nThen at turn7: y=1 -> U to turn8: y=2.\nThen at turn8: y=2 -> we cannot go up at turn9, so we go down to y=1 at turn9? \n  (9,1): safe? freeway1 at T=9: safe.\nThen at turn9: y=1 -> U to turn10: y=2.\n  (10,2): freeway2 at T=10: safe?

That would mean we reach y=9 at turn15.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=1.\nAfter 10 actions, we are at turn15, and we want y=9.\n\nSo we need to move up 8 times and maybe down or stay twice? But we start at y=1, so to get to y=9 we need 8 net up moves. So we must have 8 U and 2 other moves that are not U? Or 8 U and 0 non-U? But we have 10 moves, so we must have 8 U and 2 non-U (S or D).\n\nBut we cannot avoid the unsafe turn6 at y=1 and y=2? So we must use at least one down move at the beginning.\n\nThen we have 8 U and 1 D and 1? We need one more non-U to fill 10 moves.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the unsafe turn9 at y=3,4,5.\n\nAt turn9, we cannot be at y=3,4,5. So we must be at y<=2 or y>=6? But at turn9, we are at move 4? \n\nLet me count the turns:\n\nt5: start y=1\nt6: after action1 -> y1\nt7: after action2 -> y2\nt8: after action3 -> y3\nt9: after action4 -> y4\nt10: after action5 -> y5\nt11: after action6 -> y6\nt12: after action7 -> y7\nt13: after action8 -> y8\nt14: after action9 -> y9\nt15: after action10 -> y10\n\nWe require y10=9.\n\nAnd we start at y=1, so the net change: we need to go up by 8.\n\nBut we have 10 moves: U, D, S. Let u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S. Then u - d = 8, and u+d+s=10.\n\nThen 8 + d + d + s = 10? \n  u = 8 + d\n  then 8+d + d + s = 10 => 8 + 2d + s = 10 => 2d+s=2.\n\nSo possible: \n  d=1, s=0 -> then u=9 -> then total moves: 9U,1D -> net up: 9-1=8 -> works.\n  d=0, s=2 -> u=8 -> 8U,2S.\n  d=1, s=0: we have one down and one up extra? \n  d=0, s=2: we have two stays.\n\nWe also have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must have one down move. The down move must be at a turn when we are not at y=0? because if we are at y=0, we cannot go down.\n\nSimilarly, we have to avoid unsafe freeways.\n\nThe only unsafe times we know are:\n\nTurn6: y=1,2 unsafe.\nTurn9: y=3,4,5 unsafe.\nTurn11,12: y=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at these y at these turns.\n\nWe are at:\n  t5: y=1 -> safe.\n  t6: we must be at y=0? because y=1,2 unsafe. So the only safe y at t6 is 0.\n        so we must use a down move at t5 to go to y=0 at t6.\n\n  t6: y=0.\n  t7: we can go to y=1 (by U) or y=0 (S) or cannot go down (D not allowed from 0).\n\n        But if we go to y=1 at t7: safe? freeway1 at t7: safe.\n        Or if we stay at 0: safe.\n\n  t7: let's say we go to y=1 at t7.\n  t8: from y=1, we can go to y=2 (U) or y=0 (D) or y=1 (S).\n        freeway1 at t8: safe? yes.\n        if we go to y=2: freeway2 at t8: safe.\n\n  t9: we cannot be at y=3,4,5. So we must be at y<=2 or y>=6? \n        But at t9, we are after 4 actions, so we are at move4. \n        We started at y=1, then went to 0, then to 1, then to 2? then at t9 we are at y=2 or y=1 or y=0 or y=3? \n        But if we went to y=2 at t8, then at t9 we can go to y=3 (U) -> unsafe, or y=2 (S) or y=1 (D) or y=0? (if we go D from 2 to 1).\n\n        So we can avoid y=3,4,5 by staying at y=2 or going down to y=1 or 0.\n\n        But we also have to consider the next moves: we need to get to y=9 by t15.\n\n        We are at t9: y=2 (say). Then we need to go up 7 more times? because from y=2 to y=9: 7 up moves.\n\n        But we have 6 moves left (t9 to t14) and then t15 we get the last move? \n          Actions at t9,t10,t11,t12,t13,t14 -> 6 actions.\n\n        We need 7 up moves? so we cannot.\n\n        Alternatively, if we are at y=1 at t9, then we need 8 up moves in 6 actions? impossible.\n\n        Similarly, if we are at y=0 at t9, then we need 9 up moves in 6 actions? impossible.\n\n        So we must be at y>=2 at t9? and then we have to make 7 up moves in 6 actions -> we must have 7 U and -1? impossible.\n\n        Actually, we have 6 actions (t9 to t14) to move from y to 9: so we need 9 - y moves up? and we can have down and stay too, but net up must be 9-y.\n\n        And we have 6 moves: so 9-y <= 6? => y>=3.\n\n        But at t9, we cannot be at y=3,4,5 because unsafe.\n\n        So we must be at y>=6 at t9.\n\n        How can we get to y>=6 at t9? \n\n        We start: \n          t5: y=1\n          t6: must be at 0.\n          t7: we go to y=1 (U) -> then at t7: y=1.\n          t8: we go to y=2 (U) -> then at t8: y=2.\n          t9: we need to be at y>=6? How? \n                from y=2 at t8, we can go to y=3 at t9? but unsafe.\n\n        Or at t7: from y=0, we go up to y=1? but then t7: y=1.\n          then t8: we can go up to y=2.\n          then we are stuck.\n\n        What if at t6: we go up? but from y=0 at t6, we can only go to y=1 at t7? \n\n        Or what if we do not go up at t7? \n          t6: y=0.\n          t7: we stay at y=0 (S) -> then at t7: y=0.\n          t8: then we go to y=1 (U) -> then at t8: y=1.\n          t9: then we go to y=2 (U) -> then at t9: y=2.\n\n        Then same as before.\n\n        Or at t8: from y=0 we go up to y=1? \n          t6: y=0.\n          t7: S -> y=0.\n          t8: U -> y=1.\n          t9: U -> y=2.\n\n        Then we are at y=2 at t9.\n\n        Then we need to get to y=9 in 6 moves: net up 7, so we need 7 U and we have 6 moves? impossible.\n\n        Therefore, it is impossible to be at y>=6 at t9.\n\n        Hence, there is no path with 10 actions.\n\n        So minimal H is 11.\n\n        Therefore, we output the 11-action sequence we found.\n\nBut note: in the sequence we have one down and one stay and 9 up? \n  Actions: D, U, U, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U -> \n      D: down once.\n      S: stay once.\n      U: 9 times.\n\n  Net up: 9 - 1 = 8, which matches.\n\nNow, we write the actions:\n\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut we must check the last state: at turn15 we do U to go from y=8 to y=9 at turn16.\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) at turn16.\n\nSo the sequence has 11 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, we list the actions for turns 5 to 15.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway at turn8 for y=2: \n  freeway2 at T=8: \n      car: (12,47,left,36) -> [12-36*(8-5),47-36*(8-5)] = [12-108,47-108]=[-96,-61] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn9: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=9: [12-36*4,47-36*4]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n\nTurn10: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=10: \n      car1: (-12,-23,right,12): [-23+12*5, -12+12*5]=[37,48] -> safe.\n      car2: (-48,-59,right,12): [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12] -> 0 not in? safe.\n      car3: (36,25,right,12): [25+60,36+60]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn11: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=11: same as freeway3 at T=11? \n      car1: [-23+12*6, -12+12*6]=[49,60] -> safe.\n      car2: [-59+12*6, -48+12*6]=[13,24] -> safe.\n      car3: [25+72,36+72]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nTurn12: y=5 -> freeway5 at T=12: same: \n      car1: [-23+84, -12+84]=[61,72] -> safe.\n      car2: [-59+84, -48+84]=[25,36] -> safe.\n      car3: [25+84,36+84]=[109,120] -> safe.\n\nTurn13: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=13: \n      car: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+6*8, -36+6*8]=[-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12] -> 0 not in? safe.\n\nTurn14: y=7 -> freeway7 at T=14: \n      car: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+6*9, -36+6*9]=[-47+54, -36+54]=[7,18] -> safe.\n\nTurn15: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=15: \n      car1: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+6*10, -36+6*10]=[13,24] -> safe.\n      car2: (30,19,right,6): [19+60,30+60]=[79,90] -> safe.\n\nAnd then after the last action (at turn15: U) we go to y=9 at turn16, which is safe.\n\nSo the sequence is valid.\n\nBut note: at turn8 we did S at y=2: that is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, and the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 6 to avoid the unsafe conditions at \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) on that turn. The player then moves up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7 and to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8. At turn 9, \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe, so the player stays at \\(y = 2\\). From turn 10 onwards, the player moves up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 5, move down (D) to \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 8, stay (S) at \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 16 after 11 actions, with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U}\n}",

The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with a constant speed. The span is given, and for left-moving cars, the head is at a higher x, tail at lower x, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at time T, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. Since it's moving left, h and τ decrease. Similarly for right-moving, [τ, h] at t1, and [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] at T, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the collision condition, it says collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T. And y_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nAlso, importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So at turn T, if I move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T I'm still on y_T, and only at T+1 I'm on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe player position is given for turn t1, which is (0,0), so at turn 6, I'm at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there. Collision only matters on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the car update, it says \"for car on freeway i\", and freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nAlso, at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so I don't need to worry about collision there.\n\nBut I start at y=0 at turn 6, and need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny is from 0 to 9, so if I'm at y=0, D would try to go to y=-1, but it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so probably if action would take it out of bounds, it stays or something? But it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so I think the action is clipped, but let's see the equation.\n\nIt says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t depends on action, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]. So if I'm at y=0 and do D, Δy = -1, so y_{t+1} = -1, but since it must be in [0,9], it should be clipped to 0. Similarly, at y=9, U would go to 10, clipped to 9.\n\nIn the text: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", and it's defined as y_t + Δy, so if out of bounds, it should be set to the boundary.\n\nBut in the collision part, it might not matter since no cars at y=0 and y=9.\n\nNow, for the cars, I need to find when there is a car at x=0 on a freeway row at different turns.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, because it starts at (0,0) and moves only vertically, so position is always (0, y_t).\n\nSo collision occurs at turn T if I'm on a freeway row y_T, and for that row, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nSpan(T) includes x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway row, I have the car states at turn t1=6.\n\nLet me list all cars per row at t=6.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (0, -11, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (0, -11, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4: (0, -11, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-30, -41, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when 0 is in its span at time T, relative to t1=6.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so at time T = t1 + τ, the span depends on τ.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one left-moving car, h=-24, τ=11, s=36 at t1.\n\nDirection left, so span at T is [h - sτ, τ - sτ] where τ = T - t1.\n\nSince left-moving, head is at higher x? The span is given as [h, τ] at t1, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the right, tail on left.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ], and h and τ are positions.\n\nAt t1, head is at h, tail at τ, and since moving left, head decreases.\n\nIn the example, h=-24, τ=11, so at t1, the car is from x=11 to x=-24? That seems odd because -24 < 11, so span [h, τ] = [-24, 11] which is from -24 to 11, so head at 11, tail at -24, and moving left, so head decreases.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] at t1, so for example, (0, -11, right, 12), [τ, h] = [-11, 0], so from -11 to 0, head at 0, tail at -11, moving right, so both increase.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span, for left-moving, it's (h, τ) but in the list it's written as (head, tail), I think.\n\nLook: for freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36), and it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor left-moving: head h, tail τ, and span [h, τ]? But in the text, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], which from the position, if h=-24, τ=11, [h,τ] = [-24,11], so the car occupies x from min to max, I think it's the interval.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), and span [τ, h], so for example (0, -11, right, 12), head h=0, tail τ=-11, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0].\n\nIn this case, head is at higher x for both, but for left-moving, head is at the front when moving left, so at higher x initially, decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head at lower x initially, increasing.\n\nBut for the span, it's the set of x positions covered.\n\nNow, for collision, we care about x=0.\n\nSo for a car, at time T, if 0 is between the min and max of the span at T.\n\nLet me define for each car, the position as a function of τ = T - t1.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T is [h - sτ, τ - sτ]? From the rule.\n\nSpan(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)] for left-moving.\n\nSince moving left, both ends decrease by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nNow, at time T, 0 is in Span(T) if min ≤ 0 ≤ max.\n\nFor left-moving: min = h - sτ, max = τ - sτ? Let's see.\n\nAt T, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - sτ, τ - sτ] with τ = T - t1.\n\nBut h and τ are positions at t1, and since moving left, the left end (lower x) is h - sτ, and right end (higher x) is τ - sτ.\n\nIn the initial span at t1, [h, τ], with h and τ, but in the example, h=-24, τ=11, so min x is h=-24, max x is τ=11.\n\nAfter moving left, min x decreases, max x decreases.\n\nSo at T, min_x(T) = h - sτ, max_x(T) = τ - sτ.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, at t1, min x = τ, max x = h, and at T, min_x(T) = τ + sτ, max_x(T) = h + sτ, since both increase.\n\nτ = T - t1, I'm using τ for time offset, but in car state, τ is tail, which is confusing.\n\nI should use a different variable.\n\nSet δt = T - t1, time difference.\n\nFor a left-moving car: at time T, min_x = h - s * δt, max_x = tail - s * δt, where tail is the tail position at t1.\n\nIn notation, at t1, head position is h, tail position is τ.\n\nFor left-moving: min_x(t1) = min(h, τ), but from the span, it's given as [h, τ], which might not be ordered.\n\nIn the example, h=-24, τ=11, so min is -24, max is 11.\n\nAfter moving left by sδt, min_x(T) = min_x(t1) - sδt, max_x(T) = max_x(t1) - sδt.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, min_x(T) = min_x(t1) + sδt, max_x(T) = max_x(t1) + sδt.\n\nBut min and max at t1 are determined from the span.\n\nFor simplicity, for each car, I can find the time when x=0 is covered.\n\nFor a left-moving car, 0 is in [min_x(T), max_x(T)] when min_x(T) ≤ 0 ≤ max_x(T).\n\nmin_x(T) = min_hτ - s δt, where min_hτ is the min of h and τ at t1.\n\nSimilarly max_x(T) = max_hτ - s δt.\n\nLet A = min(h, τ) at t1, B = max(h, τ) at t1.\n\nThen for left-moving: min_x(T) = A - s δt, max_x(T) = B - s δt.\n\n0 in span iff A - s δt ≤ 0 ≤ B - s δt.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: min_x(T) = min(τ, h) + s δt, but min(τ,h) at t1, let C = min(τ,h), D = max(τ,h), then min_x(T) = C + s δt, max_x(T) = D + s δt, so 0 in span iff C + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ D + s δt.\n\nBut since the car is moving, the inequality changes.\n\nPerhaps I can solve for δt when 0 is in span.\n\nFor left-moving car:\n\n0 in [A - s δt, B - s δt] iff A - s δt ≤ 0 ≤ B - s δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to: from 0 ≤ B - s δt, so s δt ≤ B, δt ≤ B/s\n\nAnd from A - s δt ≤ 0, so A ≤ s δt, δt ≥ A/s\n\nSo δt must satisfy ceil(A/s) ≤ δt ≤ floor(B/s) or something, but since time is integer, we need to find integer δt where the inequalities hold.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\n0 in [C + s δt, D + s δt] iff C + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ D + s δt\n\nSo C + s δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ D + s δt\n\nFrom 0 ≤ D + s δt, s δt ≥ -D, δt ≥ ceil(-D/s)\n\nFrom C + s δt ≤ 0, s δt ≤ -C, δt ≤ floor(-C/s)\n\nBut let's apply to each car.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per row.\n\nStart with row 1: one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36\n\nAt t1, min x = min(-24,11) = -24, max x = max(-24,11) =11\n\nA = -24, B = 11, s=36\n\nFor left-moving, 0 in span when A - s δt ≤ 0 ≤ B - s δt\n\n-24 - 36 δt ≤ 0 ≤ 11 - 36 δt\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36 δt ≤ 0 ⇒ -36 δt ≤ 24 ⇒ δt ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, but δt ≥0 since T≥t1, so always true for δt≥0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 11 - 36 δt ⇒ 36 δt ≤ 11 ⇒ δt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so for δt = 0 only? δt integer, δt ≤ floor(11/36) =0 since 11/36<1.\n\nAt δt=0, T=t1, min_x = -24, max_x=11, 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nFor δt=1, min_x = -24 -36 = -60, max_x=11-36= -25, so span [-60,-25], 0 not in it.\n\nFor δt>0, max_x =11-36δt <0 since δt≥1, 11-36<0, so 0 > max_x, so 0 not in span.\n\nAt δt=0, it is in span.\n\nSo for row 1, car is at x=0 only at δt=0, T=t1=6.\n\nBut at T=t1, if I am on row 1, I collide.\n\nNow row 2: same as row 1, one car (-24,11,left,36), same thing, only at δt=0, 0 in span.\n\nNow row 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so head h=0, tail τ=-11, span at t1 [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nmin_x(t1) = min(τ,h) = min(-11,0) = -11, max_x(t1) = max(-11,0) =0\n\nC = min(τ,h) = -11, D = max(τ,h) =0\n\nFor right-moving, min_x(T) = C + s δt = -11 + 12 δt\n\nmax_x(T) = D + s δt = 0 + 12 δt\n\n0 in span when min_x(T) ≤ 0 ≤ max_x(T)\n\n-11 + 12 δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 δt\n\nFirst: -11 +12 δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 δt ≤ 11 ⇒ δt ≤ 11/12 <1, so for δt=0 only?

Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at time t1 + H, the position is determined by the last action.\n\nBut we want y at turn t1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nTurn t1 + H - 1 is when the position is after action a_{t1 + H - 2}? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, then action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we take action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1, y_{t1} = 0.\n\nWe want at some turn, say T, y_T = 9.\n\nT = t1 + H - 1 for some H.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t1 + (H-1) with y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at t1 + 0 to t1 + (H-1), which affect positions from t1+1 to t1+H.\n\nBut we care about positions at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSpecifically, we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t1 to t1+H-2, we need to avoid collision when on freeway.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y_{t1} = 0, which is safe.\n\nThen we take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if we are on freeway y_T and it is unsafe at that turn.\n\nNow, turns are absolute: t1=6.\n\nI need to find H and actions.\n\nSince I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimal H would be 9 if I go up every turn, but I might hit a car, so I need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each row.\n\nAbsolute turns, since t1=6.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=6\n\nRow 2: unsafe at T=6\n\nRow 3: unsafe at T=6 and T=9\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=6 and T=9\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=6 and T=9\n\nRow 6: unsafe at T=11 and T=12\n\nRow 7: unsafe at T=11 and T=12\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=11 and T=12\n\nNow, I start at T=6, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nSince y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 steps up, but I can stay or go down, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so I should go up as much as possible, avoiding the unsafe times.\n\nNow, at T=6, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at T=7, but at T=6, row 1 is unsafe, but at T=6 I am not on row 1, I am on y=0.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nAt T=6, y_6=0, safe.\n\nThen I take action a_6, which determines y_7.\n\ny_7 could be 0,1, or if I go down, but y=0, down stays 0.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nAt y=0, D: y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0\n\nS: y_{t+1} = y_t =0\n\nU: y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t +1) =1\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U stays 9, etc.\n\nNow, back to T=6.\n\nI am at y=0.\n\nI take action a_6.\n\nIf I go up, y_7=1.\n\nBut at T=7, what is unsafe? I need to check for each row at T=7.\n\nFrom above, for T=7, δt = T - t1 =7-6=1\n\nNow, for row 1: at δt=1, we saw no car at x=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 2: at δt=1, safe.\n\nRow 3: at δt=1, no unsafe, since only unsafe at δt=0 and 3.\n\nδt=1, T=7.\n\nSimilarly row 4,5: safe at δt=1.\n\nRow 6: unsafe at δt=5,6, so T=11,12; at T=7, δt=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly all rows safe at T=7.\n\nSimilarly for other times except the unsafe points.\n\nList of unsafe (row, turn) pairs:\n\n(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,9), (4,6), (4,9), (5,6), (5,9), (6,11), (6,12), (7,11), (7,12), (8,11), (8,12)\n\nFor row 3,4,5 unsafe at T=6 and T=9.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nOne way: go up directly.\n\nBut at T=6, if I go to y=1 at T=7, but y=1 at T=7 is safe, since row 1 unsafe only at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, row 1 unsafe, but at T=7, row 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at T=7, then I can go to y=2 at T=8, etc.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on row 3,4,5 at T=6 or T=9, but since I start at T=6, y=0, I am not on row 3,4,5 at T=6.\n\nNow, let's simulate going up as fast as possible.\n\nStart T=6, y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_6: U, then y_7 = 1\n\nAt T=7, y=1, which is row 1, at T=7, δt=1, safe, as above.\n\nAction a_7: U, y_8=2\n\nT=8, y=2, row 2, at T=8, δt=2.\n\nRow 2 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=8, safe.\n\nAction a_8: U, y_9=3\n\nNow T=9, y=9? y_9=3, row 3.\n\nBut at T=9, row 3 is unsafe! Because δt=3, T=9.\n\nT=9 is unsafe for row 3.\n\nSo if I am at y=3 at T=9, I collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to row 4 or 5 at T=9, same issue.\n\nSo I need to not be on row 3,4,5 at T=9.\n\nT=9 is a problem for rows 3,4,5.\n\nAlso, at T=6, rows 1,2,3,4,5 are unsafe, but I am at y=0, not on them.\n\nNow, to avoid row 3,4,5 at T=9.\n\nI can be on row 3,4,5 at other times, but not at T=9.\n\nSince I am going up, at T=9, if I am at y=3,4, or 5, I collide.\n\nSo I need to be either below or above at T=9.\n\nFor example, if at T=9 I am at y=2 or y=6 or higher.\n\ny=2 is row 2, which is safe at T=9, since unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is row 6, unsafe only at T=11,12, so at T=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 or y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=9, I should not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nNow, T=9 is turn t1 + 3, since t1=6, T=9 is 3 turns later.\n\nNow, I start at T=6, y=0.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at T=9, y_9.\n\ny_9 depends on actions from T=6 to T=8.\n\nActions at T=6,7,8 determine y_9.\n\ny_9 = y_6 + number of U minus number of D from t=6 to 8, three actions.\n\nSince y_6=0, y_9 = 0 + (U_count - D_count) from three actions, and y_9 between 0 and 9.\n\nTo avoid y_9=3,4,5.\n\nSo possible y_9: 0,1,2,6,7,8,9? But from three actions, starting y=0.\n\nMax y_9: if all U, y=3\n\nMin y_9: if all D, but at y=0, D stays 0, so y=0.\n\nIf S, y=0.\n\nSo possible y_9: with three actions, each can be U,D,S.\n\nBut D at y=0 does nothing, S does nothing.\n\ny_9 can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nCannot be higher than 3 with three up actions.\n\nSince y_6=0, after first action at T=6, y_7 <=1\n\nAfter second, y_8 <=2\n\nAfter third, y_9 <=3\n\nSimilarly, y_9 >=0.\n\nSo possible y_9: 0,1,2,3.\n\nBut I need to avoid y_9=3,4,5, but y_9 cannot be 4 or 5, only up to 3.\n\ny_9 <=3, so possible 0,1,2,3.\n\nI need to avoid y_9=3? Because if y_9=3, at T=9 on row 3, unsafe.\n\ny_9=2 is row 2, safe.\n\ny_9=1 row 1, safe at T=9.\n\ny_9=0 row 0, safe.\n\nBut y_9=3 is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not have y_9=3.\n\nThat is, after three actions, I should not be at y=3.\n\nWith three actions, if I do all U, y=3.\n\nIf I do two U and one S or D, y=2.\n\nIf one U and two S/D, y=1.\n\nIf zero U, y=0.\n\nSo to avoid y=3 at T=9, I must not do three U.\n\nThat is, I need to have y_9 <=2.\n\nSo at T=9, y_9 <=2.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nBut later I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, also there are unsafe times at T=11 and 12 for rows 6,7,8.\n\nT=11 and 12 are later.\n\nFirst, let's get to T=9 safely.\n\nSo at T=6, y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions so that at T=9, y_9 <=2.\n\nFor example, I can do U at T=6, then U at T=7, then S or D at T=8, so y_9=2.\n\nOr U at T=6, S at T=7, U at T=8, y_8=1 after first U, then S y_8=1, then U y_9=2.\n\nOr other combinations to have y_9=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go up as much as possible, so y_9=2 is better than 1 or 0.\n\nSo let's aim for y_9=2.\n\nThen at T=9, I am at y=2, row 2, safe.\n\nNow, from there, I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut I need to avoid the unsafe times at T=11 and 12 for rows 6,7,8.\n\nT=11 and 12.\n\nFirst, let's see the timeline.\n\nT=9, y=2.\n\nAction at T=9, I can go U to y=3, or S, or D to y=1.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nT=11 and 12 are unsafe for rows 6,7,8.\n\nIf I go up directly, from y=2 at T=9.\n\nAction a_9: U, y_10=3\n\nT=10, y=3, row 3. At T=10, δt=10-6=4, row 3 unsafe only at δt=0 and 3, T=6 and 9. T=10, safe.\n\nAction a_10: U, y_11=4\n\nT=11, y=4, row 4. At T=11, δt=5, row 4 unsafe only at T=6 and T=9, not T=11, so safe.\n\nAction a_11: U, y_12=5\n\nT=12, y=5, row 5. At T=12, δt=6, row 5 unsafe at T=6 and T=9, not T=12, safe.\n\nAction a_12: U, y_13=6\n\nT=13, y=6, row 6. At T=13, δt=7, row 6 unsafe at T=11 and 12, not T=13, so safe.\n\nThen continue U to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut at T=13, y=6, safe.\n\nAction a_13: U, y_14=7\n\nT=14, y=7, row 7. Safe, since unsafe only T=11,12.\n\nAction a_14: U, y_15=8\n\nT=15, y=8, row 8. Unsafe at T=11,12, not T=15, safe.\n\nAction a_15: U, y_16=9\n\nT=16, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, how many turns? From T=6 to T=16, y=9 at T=16.\n\nT=16 is turn t1 + 10, since t1=6.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAt T=16, y=9.\n\nT = t1 + H - 1 =6 + H -1\n\nSet 6 + H -1 =16, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nSequence: from T=6 to T=15, actions a6 to a15.\n\n10 actions? Let's list.\n\nStart T=6, y=0.\n\na6: U, y7=1\n\nT=7, y=1\n\na7: U, y8=2\n\nT=8, y=2\n\na8: S or D? Earlier I said at T=9 y=2, so to have y9=2, from T=8 y=2, I can do S or D.\n\nBut D at y=2 would go to y=1, but I want y9=2, so at T=8, since y8=2, I should do S to keep y=2, or D to go down, but that would make y9=1, which is worse.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=8, y=2, if I do S, y9=2.\n\nIf I do D, y9=1.\n\nBut I want y9=2 to be higher.\n\nIn the direct up, I had a problem at T=9, so I need to not go to y=3 at T=9.\n\nIn this adjusted, at T=8, y=2, I do S, so y9=2.\n\nThen at T=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a9: U, y10=3\n\nT=10, y=3, safe (as above)\n\na10: U, y11=4\n\nT=11, y=4, row 4, at T=11. Row 4 unsafe at T=6 and T=9, not T=11, so safe.\n\na11: U, y12=5\n\nT=12, y=5, row 5, unsafe at T=6 and T=9, not T=12, safe.\n\na12: U, y13=6\n\nT=13, y=6, row 6, at T=13. Unsafe times for row 6: T=11 and 12, T=13 safe.\n\na13: U, y14=7\n\nT=14, y=7, row 7, safe.\n\na14: U, y15=8\n\nT=15, y=8, row 8, safe.\n\na15: U, y16=9\n\nT=16, y=9.\n\nReached at T=16.\n\nH is such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9 at T=16.\n\nt1 + H -1 =16, t1=6, so 6 + H -1 =16, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=10, so 11 actions? Indices.\n\nSequence: actions at times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: t1 +0 =6, a6\n\nt=1: t1+1=7, a7\n\n...\n\nt=10: t1+10=16, a16? But we need up to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt time t1 + H -1, position is after action a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nSet T_final = t1 + H -1 =16.\n\nThen H-1 = T_final - t1 =16-6=10.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nActions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + (H-1) = t1 + 10 =16.\n\nBut at turn 16, we take action a16, which moves to y17, but we don't care, since we reach at turn 16.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which is a6 to a16.\n\nBut a16 is taken at turn 16, and after that y17, but y16=9 is already achieved at turn 16 before action a16? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nThen we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t is set.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nT = t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T=9.\n\nThe last action that affected position was a_{T-1}, which moved to y_T.\n\nIn the action sequence, we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, because a_{t1} affects y_{t1+1}, ..., a_{T-1} affects y_T.\n\nSince we start at y_{t1} given.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t1 + t.\n\nAfter H actions, the position at time t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, with t1=6, H=11, y_{6+11-1}=y_{16}=9.\n\nActions at t=0 to 10: times 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\na6 to a16.\n\nBut a16 is taken at turn 16, and it would affect y17, but since we care about y16, which is before a16, a16 is not needed for position y16.\n\ny16 is determined by actions up to a15.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt turn 6: position y6=0\n\na6: action, then y7\n\n...\n\na15: action at turn 15, determines y16.\n\nAt turn 16: position y16=9.\n\nThen if we take a16, it would set y17, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for y_{t1+H-1}=y16=9, we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, I think.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\ny_T is set by action a_{T-1}.\n\nThe first action is a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1+1}.\n\nBut we start with y_{t1} given.\n\nSo the actions we control are from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, which determine y_{t1+1} to y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T-1, that's (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1 actions.\n\nSince T = t1 + H -1, so T - t1 = H-1.\n\nSo we need H-1 actions to go from y_{t1} to y_T.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which has H actions, at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut for position at t1+H-1, it is affected by a_{t1+H-2}, so a_{t1+H-1} is not used for that position.\n\nPerhaps it's a bit messy.\n\nIn this case, for y16=9, we need actions from a6 to a15, which are 10 actions (turns 6 to 15).\n\nThen H-1=10, so H=11.\n\nThe actions include a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, I think.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to some.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 10 actions: a6 to a15.\n\na6: U\n\na7: U\n\na8: S (to stay at y=2 for T=9)\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\nT=6: y=0, a6=U, y7=1\n\nT=7: y=1, a7=U, y8=2\n\nT=8: y=2, a8=S, y9=2  (since S, y same)\n\nThen T=9: y=2, a9=U, y10=3\n\nT=10: y=3, a10=U, y11=4\n\nT=11: y=4, a11=U, y12=5\n\nT=12: y=5, a12=U, y13=6\n\nT=13: y=6, a13=U, y14=7\n\nT=14: y=7, a14=U, y15=8\n\nT=15: y=8, a15=U, y16=9\n\nSo at T=16, y=9.\n\nActions: a6 to a15, 10 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns? \"minimal number of turns H\"\n\nAnd \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t1} = a6\n\nt=1, a7\n\n...\n\nt=9, a15? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position at time t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for position at t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nWith H actions, we can reach up to time t1 + H.\n\nBut position at t1 + H -1 requires only H-1 actions from t1.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps H includes the starting turn or something.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nEach action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which is before the last action.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is determined by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence given has H actions, including a_{t1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t1 + H}, not y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nSo in the sequence, a_{t1 + H -1} is not needed for y_{t1 + H -1}, but it is included in the sequence.\n\nIn this case, for y16=9, we need actions a6 to a15 to set it.\n\na15 sets y16.\n\nThen for the sequence, with H actions, it should include a6 to a15, but that's 10 actions, so t from 0 to 9, H=10.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{6+10-1} = y_{15}, but we want y16=9, not y15.\n\ny15=8 in this case.\n\nProblem.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1 =16.\n\nThen H-1 = T - t1 =10, so H=11.\n\nThen y_{6+11-1}=y_{16}=9.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} = {a_{6+t}}_{t=0}^{10}, so t=0 to 10, actions at times 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nNow, a6 to a15 set y7 to y16.\n\ny16 is set by a15.\n\nAt turn 16, we are at y16, before taking a16.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include a16, which is not used, but we can set it to something, say S or U, but since we reached, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions for each turn.\n\nFor the collision, we only care up to when we reach, but since we take action at turn, we need to specify.\n\nIn this case, with H=11, we have actions up to a16.\n\nBut a16 is taken at turn 16, but since we are already at y16=9, and we don't care about further, but we have to include it in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for a16, we can do S or U, but U would try to go to 10, clipped to 9, so same.\n\nTo minimize actions, but H is fixed for the sequence.\n\nIn this sequence, with 11 actions, we reach at turn 16.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nIn the above, we used 10 actions to go from turn 6 to 16, but with waiting at T=8.\n\nSince we had to have y9<=2, we did S at T=8, so we delayed.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=6, y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I could stay or something, but that might not help.\n\nGo down? But y=0, cannot go down.\n\nSo only S or U.\n\nIf I do S at T=6, y7=0, then I am still at y=0 at T=7, which is safe, but I wasted a turn.\n\nThen I need to go up later, which takes more time.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at T=7, etc., but to have y9<=2, I can go faster? But from T=6 to T=9, only three actions, max y=3, but I need to avoid y=3, so y9=2 is the best, so I cannot be at y=3 at T=9.\n\nSo I must spend at least three actions to reach y=2 at T=9, which is what I did: two U and one S or something.\n\nIn my sequence, I did U,U,S for a6,a7,a8 to have y9=2.\n\nI could do U,S,U or S,U,U, but y9 still 2.\n\nNow, from T=9 y=2, I go up each turn to y=9 at T=16.\n\nTotal turns from T=6 to T=16, 11 turns, but T=6 is start, T=16 is end.\n\nNumber of actions: 10 actions to reach in 10 steps? From T=6 to T=16 is 10 steps? T=6 to T=7 is one step, etc.\n\nTime from start to end: from turn 6 to turn 16, inclusive, 11 turns, but we take actions on turns 6 to 15 to set positions 7 to 16.\n\nPosition at turn 16.\n\nBut we want to reach earlier if possible.\n\nNow, the unsafe times later: rows 6,7,8 unsafe at T=11 and 12.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=11, y=4, row 4, safe.\n\nT=12, y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nT=13, y=6, row 6, safe since T=13 not unsafe.\n\nBut if I can be at higher row earlier, I might avoid or something.\n\nFor example, at T=11, if I am at y=6, it is unsafe, so I need to not be on row 6,7,8 at T=11 or 12.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nIn the above sequence, at T=11, I am at y=4, below, safe.\n\nAt T=12, y=5, still below.\n\nBut if I can be above y=8 at T=11, but from T=9 y=2, to T=11, two actions, I can go to y=4 max, since y9=2, a9=U, y10=3, a10=U, y11=4. Cannot be higher.\n\nSo at T=11, I am at y=4 or less, which is row 4 or below, all safe since row 6,7,8 unsafe only at T=11,12, but I am not on them.\n\nSimilarly at T=12, y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 earlier than T=16?\n\nFor example, if I don't wait at T=8.\n\nBut I have to avoid y=3,4,5 at T=9.\n\nSuppose at T=9, I am at y=1.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 at T=9.\n\na9: U, y10=2\n\na10: U, y11=3\n\nT=11, y=3, row 3, safe.\n\na11: U, y12=4\n\nT=12, y=4, row 4, safe.\n\na12: U, y13=5\n\nT=13, y=5, row 5, safe.\n\na13: U, y14=6\n\nT=14, y=6, safe.\n\na14: U, y15=7\n\na15: U, y16=8? y15=7, a15=U, y16=8\n\nThen a16: U, y17=9, so reach at T=17, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf at T=9 y=0, even worse.\n\nSo y=2 at T=9 is better.\n\nBut with y=2 at T=9, to y=9, I need 7 more steps: from y=2 to y=9, 7 U actions, to T=16.\n\nT=9 y=2, a9 U, T=10 y=3, a10 U, T=11 y=4, ..., up to a15 U, T=16 y=9.\n\nYes, 7 actions from a9 to a15.\n\nTotal actions: from a6 to a15, 10 actions for H=11.\n\nBut H=11, sequence t=0 to 10, 11 actions, including a16.\n\nNow, but I think for a16, since we reached, we can set it to S or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to include.\n\nTo save a turn, perhaps I can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nBut how? From start, if I go directly, at T=9 I would be at y=3, but unsafe.\n\nUnless I skip the row or something, but I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nAnother idea: go down first? But at y=0, cannot go down.\n\nOr at some point go down to avoid, but in this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps for the later unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=11 and 12, rows 6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nBut in the path, I am below at that time.\n\nBut if I were higher, I might be affected.\n\nBut I cannot be higher because of the delay at T=9.\n\nSuppose I go up faster to y=6 before T=11.\n\nBut from T=6 y=0, to T=11, δt=5 turns? Turns: T=6 to T=11 is 5 steps? Actions at T=6 to T=10 determine y11.\n\ny11: start y6=0, after 5 actions, y11 <=5.\n\nMax y11=5 if all U.\n\nAt T=11, if y11=5, row 5, safe, since unsafe only at T=6 and 9.\n\nBut row 6,7,8 unsafe at T=11, but if I am at row 5, not on them.\n\nSimilarly, if y11=6, row 6, unsafe at T=11, so I must not be at y=6 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly for y=7,8.\n\nSo at T=11, I must not be on row 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly at T=12.\n\nNow, with y11 <=5, since from y6=0 to y11, max 5 steps, y11<=5, so row 5 or below, all safe for row 6,7,8 unsafe, but I am not on row 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly at T=12, y12 <=6, but if y12=6, row 6 unsafe at T=12.\n\nSo I need to avoid y12=6 if possible, but y12=6 possible.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, at T=12, y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nBut if I go faster, can I be at y=6 at T=12? But row 6 unsafe at T=12.\n\nSo if I am at y=6 at T=12, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, I need to not be on row 6,7,8 at T=11 or T=12.\n\nNow, back to the beginning.\n\nAt T=6, y=0.\n\nI need to have y9 <=2 to avoid row 3,4,5 at T=9.\n\nSo I must have y9 <=2.\n\nThen from y9=2, I go up to y10=3, y11=4, y12=5, y13=6, etc.\n\nAt T=12, y12=5, row 5, safe.\n\nIf I could be at y=6 at T=13, but T=13 is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=2 at T=9, I need 7 steps to y=9 at T=16.\n\nIf I could be higher at T=9, but I cannot because of the unsafe at T=9.\n\nUnless I am at y=6 at T=9, but impossible with 3 actions.\n\ny9 max 3, but 3 unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=1 at T=7, then stay or something, but not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 3,4,5 are only unsafe at T=6 and T=9, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=7, I can be on row 3, which is safe.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=9, I am on row 3 unsafe, but if I can arrange to be on row 3 at T=7 or T=8, safe, and at T=9 not on it.\n\nBut at T=9, I need to be not on 3,4,5.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=6, y=0, a6=U, y7=1\n\nT=7, y=1, a7=U, y8=2\n\nT=8, y=2, now instead of S, I can go U to y9=3, but unsafe.\n\nOr, I could go down at some point.\n\nSuppose at T=8, y=2, I do D, y9=1\n\nThen at T=9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, a9=U, y10=2, a10=U, y11=3, etc., slower.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt T=7, y=1, I do S, y8=1, then a8=U, y9=2, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at T=15 or earlier.\n\nT=15 is turn 15.\n\ny15=9.\n\nFrom T=6 to T=15, 9 turns later? T=6 to T=15 is 9 steps? Positions from T=6 to T=15.\n\ny15 set by a14.\n\nTo have y15=9, from y6=0, I need to increase y by 9 in 9 actions? Actions from a6 to a14, 9 actions.\n\ny7 to y15, 9 positions.\n\nFrom y6=0 to y15=9, net +9, so 9 U actions, no S or D.\n\nBut can I do that without collision?\n\nFor example: a6=U, y7=1\n\na7=U, y8=2\n\na8=U, y9=3\n\nBut at T=9, y=3, row 3, unsafe! Collision.\n\nSo impossible to go directly with all U.\n\nMust avoid being at row 3,4,5 at T=9.\n\nBut with all U, I am at y=3 at T=9.\n\nIf I do one less U, y15=8, not 9.\n\nFor example, 8 U and one S, y15=8, then I need another action to go to 9.\n\nBut y15=8, then a15=U, y16=9, same as before.\n\nCannot reach at T=15 with y15=9.\n\nSimilarly, earliest possible is T=16 with y16=9.\n\nIn my sequence, it works.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to include the action at the turn I reach.\n\nWith H=11, y_{16}=9.\n\nNow, for the later part, in the sequence I have, at T=11, y=4, but row 6,7,8 unsafe, but I am not on them.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I think I can be at y=6 at T=13, but T=13 is safe.\n\nNow, another thing: at T=11 and T=12, if I could be above y=8, but I cannot, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something, but no need.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nt1=6.\n\nSequence: actions from a6 to a15 for the moves, but with H=11, we include a16.\n\nFor a16, since at y=9, we can do S.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t1: a6 = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a7 = U\n\nTurn t1+2: a8 = S\n\nTurn t1+3: a9 = U\n\nTurn t1+4: a10 = U\n\nTurn t1+5: a11 = U\n\nTurn t1+6: a12 = U\n\nTurn t1+7: a13 = U\n\nTurn t1+8: a14 = U\n\nTurn t1+9: a15 = U\n\nTurn t1+10: a16 = ? \n\nH=11, t from 0 to 10.\n\na_{t1+10} = a16.\n\nAt turn 16, we are at y16=9, so we can set a16 to S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, it must be specified.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to take action after reaching, but since H includes it, we have to.\n\nTo avoid, set H smaller, but we cannot reach earlier.\n\nMinimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach at T=15 with y15=9.\n\nBut as above, impossible because of T=9 conflict.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 at T=8.\n\nT=8: from T=6, a6=U, y7=1; a7=U, y8=2; to have y8=3? a6=U, y7=1; a7=U, y8=2; need a8=U to y9=3, but at T=9 y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I do a6=U, y7=1; a7=U, y8=2; then at T=8, y=2, I can only go to y=1,2,3 at T=9 with a8.\n\nIf a8=U, y9=3 unsafe; if S, y9=2; if D, y9=1.\n\nCannot be at y=4 or higher.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at a8, I set to S, but I could set to D, but that would make y9=1, worse.\n\nS is fine.\n\nNow, for the cars, I think I covered.\n\nBut let's double-check row 3 at T=9.\n\nT=9, δt=3, for the second car on row 3, we had min_x=-11, max_x=0, so 0 included, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, but in row 3, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12) which at δt=0 is at x=0, but at T=9 not.\n\nBut for the second car, at δt=3.\n\nAnyway.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nNow for H=11, we need one more action at turn 16, say S.\n\nBut turn 16 action is not needed for position, but we include it.\n\nIn the answer, we write the actions for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1+H-1=6+11-1=16.\n\nSo actions at turns 6 to 16.\n\nBut at turn 16, we are already at y=9, so action can be anything, say S.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have 10 actions for turns 6 to 15, but with H=11, I need 11 actions, including turn 16.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t1 (6): a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1 (7): a_{t1+1} = U\n\nTurn t1+2 (8): a_{t1+2} = S\n\nTurn t1+3 (9): a_{t1+3} = U\n\nTurn t1+4 (10): a_{t1+4} = U\n\nTurn t1+5 (11): a_{t1+5} = U\n\nTurn t1+6 (12): a_{t1+6} = U\n\nTurn t1+7 (13): a_{t1+7} = U\n\nTurn t1+8 (14): a_{t1+8} = U\n\nTurn t1+9 (15): a_{t1+9} = U\n\nTurn t1+10 (16): a_{t1+10} = S  (or U, but S is fine)\n\nNow, y at turn 16 is 9, reached.\n\nBut the position is at turn t1+H-1=16.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence?\n\nH=10: then y_{t1+10-1}=y_{15}=9?\n\nBut with H=10, sequence actions t=0 to 9, times 6 to 15.\n\ny_{15} set by a14.\n\nTo have y15=9 from y6=0, need net +9 in 9 actions? Actions a6 to a14, 9 actions, set y7 to y15.\n\ny15 - y6 = number of U minus D, but y6=0, y15=9, so 9 more U than D.\n\nWith 9 actions, if all U, y15=9.\n\nBut with all U: y7=1, y8=2, y9=3, but at T=9 y=3 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf not all U, y15<9, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to have y15=9.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nNow, for the action at turn 16, it doesn't affect, but we have to include it.\n\nPerhaps we can set it to U, but since y=9, it stays, same as S.\n\nI think S is fine.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 6: U \\\\ Turn 7: U \\\\ Turn 8: S \\\\ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: U \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: S }\n\nBut in the box, it should be with t1, but since t1=6, it's fine.\n\nThe answer should have \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 10: S\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn t_1 + 10 is turn 16.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is not on a freeway row when a car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at that turn, based on the car movement rules.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway row (relative to \\(t_1 = 6\\)) are:\n- Row 1: unsafe at \\(T = 6\\) (\\(\\delta t = 0\\))\n- Row 2: unsafe at \\(T = 6\\) (\\(\\delta t = 0\\))\n- Row 3: unsafe at \\(T = 6\\) (\\(\\delta t = 0\\)) and \\(T = 9\\) (\\(\\delta t = 3\\))\n- Row 4: unsafe at \\(T = 6\\) (\\(\\delta t = 0\\)) and \\(T = 9\\) (\\(\\delta t = 3\\))\n- Row 5: unsafe at \\(T = 6\\) (\\(\\delta t = 0\\)) and \\(T = 9\\) (\\(\\delta t = 3\\))\n- Row 6: unsafe at \\(T = 11\\) (\\(\\delta t = 5\\)) and \\(T = 12\\) (\\(\\delta t = 6\\))\n- Row 7: unsafe at \\(T = 11\\) (\\(\\delta t = 5\\)) and \\(T = 12\\) (\\(\\delta t = 6\\))\n- Row 8: unsafe at \\(T = 11\\) (\\(\\delta t = 5\\)) and \\(T = 12\\) (\\(\\delta t = 6\\))\n\nThe strategy involves:\n- Avoiding rows 3, 4, and 5 at \\(T = 9\\) by having \\(y_9 \\leq 2\\). This is achieved by moving up to \\(y = 2\\) by turn 8 and staying there at turn 9.\n- Proceeding upward from turn 9, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16 (\\(t_1 + 10\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 6 (\\(t_1\\)), move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as row 1 is only unsafe at \\(T = 6\\) but the player is at \\(y = 0\\)).\n- At turn 7, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (row 2 is safe at \\(T = 7\\)).\n- At turn 8, stay to remain at \\(y = 2\\) (to avoid being at rows 3, 4, or 5 at \\(T = 9\\)).\n- At turn 9, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (row 3 is safe at \\(T = 9\\) only if not at unsafe times; here, \\(T = 9\\) is unsafe, but the player is at \\(y = 2\\)).\n- From turns 10 to 15, move up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16. During this period:\n  - At \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\), the player is at rows 4 and 5, which are safe, as rows 6, 7, and 8 are unsafe but the player is not on them.\n- At turn 16, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), so the action can be stay (or up, but it has no effect).\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 10\\) (i.e., turns 6 to 16) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 8\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 9\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 10\\text{: } S }\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{16} = 9\\) with \\(H = 11\\), the minimal number of turns.",

The current turn is t_1 = 7, and I'm at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left by speed times time, and for right-moving, it shifts right. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn. So if I move up or down at turn T, I'm still on y_T for that turn, and only on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nMy position updates based on action: U for up, D for down, S for stay. y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t being +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=1 at turn 7. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, left-moving, head -60, tail -25, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, span moves left.\n\n- Freeway 2: same as freeway 1, left-moving, (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\n- Freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving: (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\n- Freeway 4: same as freeway 3\n\n- Freeway 5: same as freeway 3\n\n- Freeway 6: one car, right-moving: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 7: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 8: two cars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nAll cars on freeways 3,4,5 are identical, and 6,7 are similar, 8 has an extra car.\n\nSince I'm starting at y=1, and freeway 1 is at y=1, I need to check if I collide at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 7, I'm at (0,1), so on freeway y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 has a left-moving car with span at t_1=7: head h=-60, tail τ=-25. Since left-moving, at time t, the span is [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt T = t_1, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25]\n\nNow, I need to see if 0 is in this span at turn T when I'm on that freeway.\n\nAt turn 7, I'm on y=1, freeway 1.\n\nSpan at t_1=7: [h, τ] = [-60, -25] for the car on freeway 1.\n\nIs 0 in [-60, -25]? -60 to -25, 0 is not in between, since -25 < 0? -60 to -25, that's from -60 to -25, so min -60, max -25, so 0 is greater than -25, so not in the interval. So no collision at turn 7 on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but I'm only on y=1 at turn 7, so only check that.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9. Since I can move up or down, but y=9 is above, so I should go up, but I have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, and I need to be on each when moving up, but I can skip some if I move multiple steps, but since I can only change by ±1 per turn, I have to pass through each y from 1 to 9, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars there, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nI start at y=1, need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 8 moves up, but I might need to stay or move down sometimes to avoid cars, which might increase turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so if I move up every turn, I can reach in 8 turns: from y=1 to y=2,3,...,9 in 8 steps.\n\nBut I might not be able to because of cars.\n\nFirst, let's see the car positions over time.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each future turn, when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor each car, given its state at t_1=7, I can find for which t, 0 is in Span(t).\n\nThen for each freeway y, and each turn T, if I am on y at turn T, and there is a car on y that has 0 in span at T, I collide.\n\nBut for a given freeway, multiple cars, so if any car on that freeway has 0 in span at T, and I'm on y, I collide.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I take action U or D, I move at the end of the turn, so during turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, and if for that y_T, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span on y_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nNow, let's list all cars and their spans over time.\n\nSet t_1 = 7.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-60, τ=-25, s=36, direction left.\n\nSince left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)] = [-60 - 36(T-7), -25 - 36(T-7)]\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 7\n\nSpan(T) = [-60 - 36 Δt, -25 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 is in this span if -60 -36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36 Δt\n\nThat is:\n\n-60 -36 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -25 -36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36 Δt ≤ 0 => -36 Δt ≤ 60 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36 Δt ≥ -60? Better to write:\n\n-60 -36 Δt ≤ 0 => -36 Δt ≤ 60 => divide by -36, reverse inequality: Δt ≥ 60 / (-36) * (-1)? Let's carefully.\n\n-36 Δt ≤ 60\n\nDivide both sides by -36, reverse inequality: Δt ≥ 60 / (-36) ? 60 / (-36) = -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666\n\nBut Δt = T - 7, and T ≥ 7 probably, so Δt ≥0.\n\nSince Δt ≥0, -36 Δt ≤0, so -60 -36 Δt ≤ -60 <0, so first inequality -60 -36 Δt ≤ 0 is always true for Δt ≥0.\n\nNow second inequality: 0 ≤ -25 -36 Δt\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36 Δt => 25 + 36 Δt ≤ 0? No\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36 Δt => add 36 Δt to both sides: 36 Δt ≤ -25\n\nThen since 36>0, Δt ≤ -25/36 ≈ -0.694\n\nBut Δt = T-7 ≥0, so Δt ≤ -0.694 is impossible. Thus, 0 ≤ -25 -36 Δt is never true for Δt ≥0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span for any T ≥ t_1. Because the car is moving left, starting from negative x, and since it's moving left, the span becomes more negative, so 0 is never covered. So freeway 1 is always safe? At turn T, for Δt≥0, Span(T) = [-60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt] which is from about -60 to -25 at Δt=0, to more negative, so min and max both decreasing, so 0 is always to the right, not in span. Yes, so freeway 1 has no collision at any time.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, left-moving, same parameters, so also always safe. No car covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, the span: at t_1, head h=12, tail τ=1? The notation is (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [1,12]? From the rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it says (head, tail, ...), but for right-moving, head is the front, I think.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in Span(T).\n\nFirst car on freeway 3: head=12, tail=1, right, speed=12.\n\nSo at t_1=7, Span = [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nThen Span(T) = [1 + 12 Δt, 12 + 12 Δt] where Δt = T - 7\n\n0 in span if 1 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 1 + 12 Δt ≥1 >0 for Δt≥0, so left inequality 1+12Δt ≤0 is impossible since ≥1. Thus 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nhead=-24? tail=-35? For right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen Span(T) = [-35 + 12 Δt, -24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -24 + 12 Δt => 24 ≤ 12 Δt => Δt ≥ 24/12 = 2\n\nSo for Δt between 2 and 35/12 ≈ 2.9167, so Δt=2, since turns are integer.\n\nΔt=2: T = t_1 + Δt = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nCheck: at Δt=2, Span(T) = [-35 + 12*2, -24 + 12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is in [-11,0]? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nΔt=2: T=9, span [-11,0], 0 in span.\n\nNow third car on freeway 3: (60,49,right,12)\n\nhead=60, tail=49, Span(t_1) = [49,60]\n\nSpan(T) = [49 + 12 Δt, 60 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span? 49 +12Δt >0 always, so 0 ≤ 49+12Δt always true, but 49+12Δt ≤0? Impossible, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the second car causes collision at T=9 when Δt=2.\n\nAt T=9, if I'm on freeway 3, I collide.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so identical. So collision at T=9 if on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision at T=9.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nhead=-24? tail=-35? Right-moving.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSpan(T) = [-35 + 6 Δt, -24 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: -35 +6 Δt ≤0 => 6 Δt ≤35 => Δt ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +6 Δt => 24 ≤ 6 Δt => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 5.833, so Δt=4,5\n\nT = 7 + Δt, so T=11 and 12? t_1=7, Δt=4, T=11; Δt=5, T=12\n\nAt T=11: Span = [-35 + 6*4, -24 + 6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], 0 in span.\n\nAt T=12: [-35 + 30, -24 + 30] = [-5, 6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nAt T=13: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=11 and T=12 on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: same car as above, (-24,-35,right,6), so same, collision at T=11 and 12.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,6) same as above, so causes collision at T=11 and 12.\n\nSecond car: (42,31,right,6)\n\nhead=42, tail=31, Span(t_1) = [31,42]\n\nSpan(T) = [31 + 6 Δt, 42 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span? 31+6Δt >0, so never ≤0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for freeway 8, only the first car matters, collision at T=11 and 12.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs (if I'm on that y at that turn):\n\n- y=1: no collision ever\n\n- y=2: no collision ever (same as y=1)\n\n- y=3: collision at T=9\n\n- y=4: collision at T=9\n\n- y=5: collision at T=9\n\n- y=6: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=7: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=8: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\ny=8 has collision at T=11 and 12, same as y=6 and y=7.\n\nNow, I start at turn 7, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe direct path: move up each turn.\n\nStart turn 7: y=1, safe.\n\nTurn 8: if I move up, y=2. Freeway y=2 has no collision ever, so safe at any turn.\n\nTurn 9: move up to y=3. But at turn 9, if I'm on y=3, collision because y=3 has car at T=9.\n\nAt turn 9, if I am on y=3, I collide.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 8, I am on y=2 (after moving up from turn 7).\n\nThen at turn 8, I take action, say U, then at turn 9, I start on y=3.\n\nAt turn 9, I am on y=3, and since collision at T=9 on y=3, I collide.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3 at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=4 or y=5 at turn 9, because all have collision at T=9.\n\ny=3,4,5 all have collision at T=9.\n\nSo at turn 9, I must not be on y=3,4, or 5.\n\nNow, later, at T=11 and 12, I must not be on y=6,7,8.\n\nBut since I'm going up, I might pass those before or after.\n\nFirst, I need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at turn 9.\n\nSince I start at y=1 turn 7.\n\nPossible actions: I can stay, move up, or move down.\n\nBut moving down to y=0 might waste time.\n\ny=0 is safe, but I need to go up.\n\nI can delay my arrival to y=3,4,5 until after turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is Δt=2 from t_1=7.\n\nAt turn 7: y=1\n\nTurn 8: I can choose to stay at y=1, or move to y=2 or y=0.\n\nIf I move to y=2 at turn 8, then at turn 9 I would be on y=3 if I go up, but I cannot.\n\nSo at turn 8, if I go to y=2, then turn 9 I must not go to y=3.\n\nI could stay at y=1 or go to y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, I must not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 are safe at all times, I can stay there.\n\ny=6,7,8 have problems at T=11 and 12.\n\nT=11 is turn 11, which is Δt=4 from t_1=7, so T=7+4=11.\n\nSimilarly T=12=7+5.\n\nNow, let's list the turns.\n\nCurrent turn: t=7, y=1\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, I can go up each turn: t=7:y1, t=8:y2, t=9:y3, t=10:y4, t=11:y5, t=12:y6, t=13:y7, t=14:y8, t=15:y9. But at t=9 on y3 collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nI need to avoid being on y3,4,5 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y6,7,8 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nNow, since I start from below, I can stay at lower y until t=9 passes.\n\nFor example, at t=7: y=1, I can stay.\n\nThen t=8: still y=1 if I stay, or go to y=2.\n\nIf at t=8 I am at y=1, then I can at t=8 go to y=2 or stay or down.\n\nBut I need to not be on y3 at t=9.\n\nSo at t=9, I should be on y=1 or y=2 or y=0 or y=6+ but y6+ is far.\n\ny=0,1,2 are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 are dangerous at t=11,12.\n\nNow, t=9 is soon.\n\nSo one way: stay at y=1 for a few turns.\n\nAt t=7: start y=1\n\nOption 1: stay at t=7: action S, then at t=8, still y=1.\n\nThen at t=8, I can S again, so at t=9, y=1.\n\nThen at t=9, I am on y=1, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThen after t=9, I can start moving up.\n\nBut t=9 is past, so y=3,4,5 are safe after t=9? At t=10, etc.\n\ny=3,4,5 only have collision at t=9, so for t>9, no collision on y=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 have collision at t=11 and 12, so for other times, no collision.\n\nNow, after t=9, I can go up.\n\nBut I also have to worry about t=11 and 12 on y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, from t=9, y=1, I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go up each turn: t=9:y1, action U to y2 at t=10? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I take action a_T, then at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo at t=9, I am at y=1 (if I stayed).\n\nThen I take action, say U, so at t=10, I am at y=2.\n\nThen at t=10, I take U, at t=11, y=3.\n\nBut at t=11, I am on y=3, which is safe now, since collision only at t=9.\n\ny=3 safe at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, I take U, to y=4 at t=12.\n\nt=12, y=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=13.\n\nt=13, y=5, safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=14.\n\nNow at t=14, y=6.\n\nBut y=6 has collision at t=11 and t=12, but t=14 is later, so safe? At t=14, Δt=14-7=7, for y=6 car: earlier, for freeway 6, car has collision at Δt=4 and 5, T=11 and 12.\n\nAt Δt=6, T=13, span [ -35 +6*6, -24 +6*6] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=14, Δt=7, [ -35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], safe.\n\nSo at t=14, y=6 safe.\n\nThen from y=6 at t=14, take U to y=7 at t=15.\n\nt=15, y=7, Δt=15-7=8, for y=7 car: span [ -35 +6*8, -24 +6*8] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=16.\n\nt=16, y=8, Δt=9, span for y=8 car (first one) [ -35 +6*9, -24+54] = [-35+54, -24+54] = [19,30], safe? y=8 has cars, but at t=16, Δt=9, [ -35 +54=19, -24+54=30], 0 not in, and second car [31 +6*9, 42+54] = [31+54=85,42+54=96], not near 0. So safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=17.\n\nt=17, y=9, reached.\n\nBut this took many turns: from t=7 to t=17, that's 11 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nStart at t=7, y=1.\n\nAction at t=7: S (stay), so at t=8, y=1\n\nt=8: S (stay), at t=9, y=1\n\nt=9: U, to y=2 at t=10\n\nt=10: U, to y=3 at t=11\n\nt=11: U, to y=4 at t=12\n\nt=12: U, to y=5 at t=13\n\nt=13: U, to y=6 at t=14\n\nt=14: U, to y=7 at t=15\n\nt=15: U, to y=8 at t=16\n\nt=16: U, to y=9 at t=17\n\nSo reached at turn t=17, with H=11 turns? From t=7 to t=17, that's 11 steps, but H is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=7, we have actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at t_1 + H -1 we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at t=17, y=9, which is turn t=17.\n\nt_1=7, so t_1 + H -1 =17, so 7 + H -1 =17, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut I spent two turns staying at y=1 to avoid t=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can do better.\n\nInstead of staying at y=1, I could go to y=2 earlier or something.\n\nAt t=7: y=1, I could go up to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on y=2, which is safe.\n\nNow at t=8, I need to decide action for turn 8.\n\nAt t=9, I must not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nSo if I am at y=2 at t=8, I can stay at y=2 (action S), so at t=9, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I can start moving up.\n\nAt t=9: y=2, U to y=3 at t=10.\n\nt=10: y=3, which is after t=9, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=11.\n\nt=11: y=4, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at t=12.\n\nt=12: y=5, safe.\n\nNow U to y=6 at t=13.\n\nBut at t=13, y=6, which is safe since t=13 > t=12.\n\nNow, but I have to deal with y=6,7,8 at t=11 and t=12, but in this path, at t=11 I am on y=4, at t=12 on y=5, not on y=6,7,8, so no problem.\n\nThen at t=13, y=6, safe as before.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=14, y=8 at t=15, y=9 at t=16.\n\nNow, turns:\n\nt=7: start y=1, action U to y=2 at t=8\n\nt=8: at y=2, action S (stay), so at t=9, y=2\n\nt=9: at y=2, action U to y=3 at t=10\n\nt=10: at y=3, U to y=4 at t=11\n\nt=11: at y=4, U to y=5 at t=12\n\nt=12: at y=5, U to y=6 at t=13\n\nt=13: at y=6, U to y=7 at t=14\n\nt=14: at y=7, U to y=8 at t=15\n\nt=15: at y=8, U to y=9 at t=16\n\nSo at t=16, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =16, 7 + H -1 =16, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBetter than 11.\n\nI stayed one turn at y=2.\n\nCan I avoid staying?\n\nAnother option: at t=7, go to y=2.\n\nThen at t=8, instead of staying, I could go down to y=1, but that might not help.\n\nOr I could go up to y=3 at t=9, but I cannot because of collision.\n\nUnless I can be on y=3 at a different time.\n\nBut y=3 only dangerous at t=9, so at t=8 or t=10 it is safe.\n\nBut at t=8, if I want to be on y=3, but from where.\n\nAt t=7, y=1, if I go up, at t=8 y=2.\n\nThen at t=8, if I go up, to y=3 at t=9, which is bad.\n\nIf I stay, as before.\n\nCould I reach y=3 earlier? But at t=7 I am at y=1, earliest to y=3 is at t=9 if I go up both times.\n\nAt t=7: U to y=2 at t=8\n\nt=8: U to y=3 at t=9\n\nBut at t=9 on y=3 collision.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=3 before t=9? At t=8, I can be on y=2 or y=1 or y=0, but not y=3.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3 at t=8 or earlier; t=9 is the first possible turn to be on y=3.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\nSo I must not be on y=3,4,5 at t=9.\n\nThus, I need to be at y<=2 or y>=6 at t=9, but y=6 is too far, since at t=7 y=1, it takes at least 5 moves to y=6 (1 to2,2to3,3to4,4to5,5to6), so at turn t=12 I can be at y=6 earliest? From y=1 at t=7:\n\nt=7: U to y2 t=8\n\nt=8: U to y3 t=9 — but at t=9 on y3 collision, so not possible.\n\nTo reach y=6 without being on y3,4,5 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I need to be not on those y.\n\nFor example, if I stay at lower y until t=9.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the previous, with one stay, I reached in H=10.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nPerhaps by moving down to y=0, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 and y=2 are safe, I can move between them.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, about the later problem: y=6,7,8 at t=11 and 12.\n\nIn the path above, when I go up, at t=11 I am on y=4, t=12 on y=5, so not on y=6,7,8, so fine.\n\nBut if I go faster, I might be on y=6,7,8 at t=11 or 12.\n\nFor example, suppose I start at t=7 y=1, U to y2 t=8\n\nThen at t=8, I stay, S, to y2 at t=9\n\nThen at t=9, U to y3 t=10\n\nt=10, U to y4 t=11\n\nt=11, U to y5 t=12\n\nt=12, U to y6 t=13\n\netc., as before.\n\nAt t=11, I am on y=4, not y=6.\n\nIf I want to be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at t=9, I must be at y<=2.\n\nSo after t=9, I start from y<=2.\n\nEarliest to y=9: from y=2 at t=9, to y=3 at t=10, y4 t=11, y5 t=12, y6 t=13, y7 t=14, y8 t=15, y9 t=16. Same as before, H=10.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, it would take one more turn.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, I start from y=1 at t=7, go to y=2 at t=8, stay at t=8 to y=2 at t=9, then go up.\n\nAt t=9 I am at y=2.\n\nCould I be at y=2 at t=9 with fewer actions?\n\nAt t=7 y=1, if I go directly to y=2 at t=8, then at t=8 I stay to be at y=2 at t=9. That's fine.\n\nIf at t=7 I stay, y=1 at t=8, then at t=8 I go to y=2, so at t=9 y=2, same.\n\nBut in that case, at t=8 I am at y=1, then go to y=2 at t=9, which is same as before.\n\nIn terms of position at t=9, I am at y=2.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, about t=11 and 12.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=4 at t=11, y=5 at t=12, which are safe.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 are dangerous at t=11,12.\n\nNow, if I could be on y=6 earlier or later to avoid t=11,12.\n\nBut in this case, since I start from y=2 at t=9, I reach y=6 at t=13, which is after t=12, so safe.\n\nIf I go faster, but I cannot because of the t=9 issue.\n\nAnother thought: could I go down to y=0 at some point?\n\nFor example, at t=7, go down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I can go up to y=1 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut at t=9 y=1, then to y2 t=10, y3 t=11, etc., same as before but one turn later because I went down first.\n\nt=7: start y=1, D to y=0 at t=8\n\nt=8: at y=0, U to y=1 at t=9\n\nt=9: at y=1, U to y=2 at t=10\n\nthen y3 t=11, y4 t=12, y5 t=13, y6 t=14, etc., to y9 at t=17, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nThus, the sequence with one stay at y=2 seems best so far, H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the stay by going directly to higher y later, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=3 at t=10, but that requires being at y=2 at t=9 or something.\n\nBut at t=9 I need to be not on y=3.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on y=3 at t=10, which is fine.\n\nNow, another issue: when I go to y=6 at t=13, but t=13 is after t=12, safe.\n\nBut I have to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have cars, but only dangerous at t=11 and t=12.\n\nIn my path, at t=14 I am on y=7, which is fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can be faster by not staying.\n\nSuppose I start at t=7 y=1, U to y2 at t=8.\n\nNow, at t=8, instead of staying, I go up to y=3 at t=9, but collision, cannot.\n\nOr go down to y=1, then at t=9 y=1, same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 or something, but impossible in one move.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal for now.\n\nBut let's check the later collision times.\n\nIn this sequence, I avoid the dangerous times.\n\nBut I might reach earlier if I can skip some y or something, but I have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 and y=2 are safe, I could move up and down between them to waste time until after t=9, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=7: U to y2 t=8\n\nt=8: D to y1 t=9\n\nThen at t=9 y=1, same as before, but I used an extra down move, so to reach y=9 later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo staying at y=2 at t=8 for one turn is efficient.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper part, I need to avoid y=6,7,8 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nIn my current plan, I am on y=4 at t=11, y=5 at t=12, so not on those.\n\nBut suppose I reach y=6 earlier.\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=6 at t=10 or something.\n\nBut at t=10, to be on y=6, I need to have been at y=5 at t=9, but at t=9 I cannot be on y=5 because of collision.\n\nAt t=9, I must be on y<=2, so at t=10, I can be at y=1,2, or 3.\n\ny=3 at t=10 is possible, as in the sequence.\n\nThen y=4 at t=11, etc.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=6 before t=12 or later.\n\nt=12: to be on y=6 at t=12, I need to be at y=5 at t=11, which requires at y=4 at t=10, y=3 at t=9, but at t=9 on y=3 collision, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=6 at t=13, as in the sequence.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence I have, at t=12 I am on y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=12, since only collision at t=9.\n\nThen I go to y=6 at t=13.\n\nBut at t=13, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, y=6,7,8 have collisions at t=11 and t=12, but t=13 is after, so ok.\n\nBut is there a problem at y=8 or something?\n\nIn freeway 8, there is another car, but we saw it doesn't cover x=0.\n\nNow, but I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nt=7: action U (to go to y=2 at next turn)\n\nt=8: action S (stay at y=2)\n\nt=9: action U (to y=3)\n\nt=10: action U (to y=4)\n\nt=11: action U (to y=5)\n\nt=12: action U (to y=6)\n\nt=13: action U (to y=7)\n\nt=14: action U (to y=8)\n\nt=15: action U (to y=9)\n\nAt t=15, after action U, I am at y=9 at turn t=16.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, with t_1=7, so 7 + H -1 =16, H=10.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=15, that's 9 actions? Let's list the turns for actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the position is given at turn t_1, so after action a_t, at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the output, we need to specify for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nAfter performing a_{t_1} at turn t_1, I go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, until at some turn, after action, I am at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=15, I perform U, and at turn t=16, I am at y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn t=15, and at turn t=16 I reach.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=7, so 7 + H -1 =16, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=15 inclusive, that's 9 actions? t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15: that's 9 turns.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=7 to t=15, that's 15-7+1=9 actions.\n\nThen at turn t=16, I am at y=9, which is the position after last action.\n\nIn the turn sequence, at turn t=16, I don't perform action, I am already there.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn t=16, I am at (0,9), and t_1 + H -1 =16, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: for turn t=7 to t=15.\n\nBut in the action list, we list a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is a_7 to a_15.\n\nNow, in the sequence: a_7 = U (to y=2 at t=8)\n\na_8 = S (stay at y=2, so y=2 at t=9)\n\na_9 = U (to y=3 at t=10)\n\na_10 = U (to y=4 at t=11)\n\na_11 = U (to y=5 at t=12)\n\na_12 = U (to y=6 at t=13)\n\na_13 = U (to y=7 at t=14)\n\na_14 = U (to y=8 at t=15)\n\na_15 = U (to y=9 at t=16)\n\nAnd at t=16, y=9.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that at each step, no collision.\n\nLet's verify each turn:\n\nTurn t=7: position y=1, freeway y=1, no car covers x=0, safe. Action U.\n\nAfter action, at t=8, y=2.\n\nTurn t=8: position y=2, freeway y=2, no collision ever, safe. Action S (stay), so at t=9, y=2.\n\nTurn t=9: position y=2, freeway y=2, safe. Action U, to y=3 at t=10.\n\nTurn t=10: position y=3, freeway y=3. Now at t=10, which is Δt=10-7=3.\n\nFor freeway 3, cars: only collision at t=9, but t=10, Δt=3.\n\nFirst car: span [1 +12*3, 12+12*3] = [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], no.\n\nSecond car: span [-35 +12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [49+36,60+36]=[85,96], no. So safe at t=10. Action U to y=4 at t=11.\n\nTurn t=11: position y=4, freeway y=4. Similar to y=3, at t=11, Δt=4.\n\nSpan for cars: first car [1+12*4,12+48]=[49,60], no\n\nSecond car [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], no\n\nThird car [49+48,60+48]=[97,108], no. Safe. Action U to y=5 at t=12.\n\nTurn t=12: position y=5, freeway y=5. Δt=5.\n\nSpan: first car [1+60,12+60]=[61,72], no\n\nSecond car [-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36], no\n\nThird car [49+60,60+60]=[109,120], no. Safe. Action U to y=6 at t=13.\n\nTurn t=13: position y=6, freeway y=6. Now y=6 has car (-24,-35,right,6) but at t=13, Δt=6.\n\nSpan: [-35 +6*6, -24+36] = [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe. Action U to y=7 at t=14.\n\nTurn t=14: position y=7, freeway y=7. Car same, Δt=7, span [-35+42, -24+42]=[7,18], safe. Action U to y=8 at t=15.\n\nTurn t=15: position y=8, freeway y=8. Cars: first (-24,-35,right,6) span at Δt=8: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24], safe.\n\nSecond car (42,31,right,6) span [31+48,42+48]=[79,90], safe. Action U to y=9 at t=16.\n\nTurn t=16: at y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=10.\n\nCan I do with H=9?\n\nThat would mean reaching at turn t=15, since t_1 + H -1 =7 +9 -1=15.\n\nSo at turn t=15, I need to be at y=9.\n\nThat means I must have been at y=8 at t=14, and took U.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=14, I need to be at y=7 at t=13, and so on.\n\nEarliest: start t=7 y=1.\n\nt=7: U to y2 t=8\n\nt=8: U to y3 t=9 — but at t=9 on y3 collision, impossible.\n\nt=7: S to y1 t=8\n\nt=8: U to y2 t=9\n\nt=9: U to y3 t=10\n\n...\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=15, I need to be at y=8 at t=14.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=7 to y=8 at t=14, that is 7 moves, but I have to avoid the collision at t=9.\n\nIf I go directly: t=7: U to y2 t=8\n\nBut then at t=8, if I U to y3 t=9, collision.\n\nIf at t=8 I stay, S to y2 t=9, then t=9 U to y3 t=10, t=10 U to y4 t=11, t=11 U to y5 t=12, t=12 U to y6 t=13, t=13 U to y7 t=14, t=14 U to y8 t=15, then to y9 at t=16, same as before.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=14, I need y=7 at t=13, etc.\n\nFrom t=9, I need to go from y<=2 to y=8 in 5 turns? From t=9 to t=14.\n\nAt t=9, I am at y=2 (say), then t=9: U to y3 t=10\n\nt=10: U to y4 t=11\n\nt=11: U to y5 t=12\n\nt=12: U to y6 t=13\n\nt=13: U to y7 t=14\n\nt=14: U to y8 t=15? At t=14 I am at y=7, take U to y8 at t=15.\n\nThen to y9 at t=16.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=14, I need to be at y=7 at t=13.\n\nAt t=9 y=2, to y=7 at t=13: that's 4 moves: y2 to y3 at t=10, y4 t=11, y5 t=12, y6 t=13, y7 at t=14? t=13 position y=6? Let's see:\n\nAt t=9: position y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=10\n\nt=10: position y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=11\n\nt=11: position y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=12\n\nt=12: position y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=13\n\nt=13: position y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=14\n\nt=14: position y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=15\n\nThen t=15: position y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=16.\n\nSo y=8 at t=15, y=9 at t=16.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before t=16.\n\nIf I start from y=1 at t=9, it takes one more.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for H=10, we have actions from t=7 to t=15.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut let's write in terms of t_1.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nSince H=10, actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 9.\n\nSince H=10.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t_1 to t_1 +9.\n\nt_1=7, so t=7 to 15, which is t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9, so for t_1=7, up to 16? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16 for t_1=7, so 7 + H -1 =16, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe actions are for turns: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_7 to a_15, which is 9 actions? Indices from 7 to 15 inclusive: 15-7+1=9 actions.\n\nBut H=10, and the turns for actions are H turns.\n\nThe player position is at turn t_1, then after each action, position changes.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9), I think.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t_1.\n\nThen, at each turn t >= t_1, the player performs an action a_t.\n\nAfter performing a_t, the position updates to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at some turn, say T.\n\nThen, T = t_1 + H, because after H actions, we have done H turns? No.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given.\n\nAfter turn t_1, we perform a_{t_1}, then at turn t_1 +1, position is y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, perform a_{t_1 +1}, to get to turn t_1 +2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + k for some k.\n\nThen k = H, the number of actions? In the problem, it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", which is from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9)? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t after action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, after action a_t, we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =1.\n\nAfter actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have H actions.\n\nAfter last action at turn t_1 + H -1, we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the text: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the problem: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd in the action sequence, {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, i.e., turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, after action, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H -1} + Δy_{t_1 + H -1}, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nI think there might be confusion.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9),\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nIn the game dynamics, at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we compute y_{t+1} for next turn.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9 means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen, the action at that turn doesn't change y if S, or could change, but we are already at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, in my earlier sequence, at turn t=16, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=7, so 7 + H -1 =16, H=10.\n\nAnd actions from t=7 to t=15.\n\nAt turn t=15, we perform a_{15}, which is U, to go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut at turn t=16, we are at y=9, which is the position.\n\nIn the action at t=15, we move to y=9.\n\nBut the position at turn t=15 is y=8, and after action U, at t=16 y=9.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t_1 + H -1, we are already at y=9.\n\nIn this case, if at some turn, we are at y=9, we don't need to move, but we can stay.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T with y_T=9.\n\nThen in the action sequence, the last action might be S if we were already at y=9, or U/D to reach it.\n\nBut in this case, since we start from below, we need to arrive at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn t=16, y=9.\n\nIf I can arrive earlier.\n\nBut with cars, it might not be possible.\n\nSuppose at some point I reach y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn t=15.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =15, so H-1=8? t_1=7, 7 + H -1 =15, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nNow, at turn t=15, y=9.\n\nThat means at turn t=14, position y=8 or y=9 or y=10, but y=10 not possible, so y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at t=14 y=8, then action U to y=9 at t=15.\n\nIf at t=14 y=9, then action S to stay at y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=14 or earlier.\n\nEarliest to y=9: from y=1 at t=7, with 8 moves: to y=9 at t=15.\n\nt=7: y=1\n\nIf all U: t=7 U to y2 t=8\n\nt=8 U to y3 t=9 — but at t=9 on y3 collision.\n\nImpossible.\n\nTo avoid, I must not be on y=3 at t=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=15, I need to go through y=3 to y=8 at some points.\n\nAt t=9, I must be on y<=2 or y>=6, but y>=6 at t=9 impossible from y=1.\n\nSo I must be on y<=2 at t=9.\n\nThen from there, to y=9 at t=15, I need 7 moves? From y=2 at t=9 to y=9 at t=15.\n\nAt t=9: y=2\n\nt=9: action, to y= something at t=10\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=15, that is position at turn 15.\n\nFrom turn t=9 to t=15, that is 6 turns: t=9 to t=14 actions determine y at t=10 to t=15.\n\nActions at t=9 to t=14 affect position at t=10 to t=15.\n\nAt t=9, position y=2.\n\nAfter action at t=9, y_{10} = y_9 + Δy.\n\nWe need y_{15} =9.\n\nSo from y_9=2 to y_15=9, need to increase by 7 in 6 actions? Not necessarily, since we can move up and down.\n\nBut minimal is to move up 7 times, but that would require 7 actions, but from t=9 to t=14, only 6 actions (t=9,10,11,12,13,14), affecting y at t=10 to t=15.\n\ny_{10} to y_{15}, 6 positions.\n\ny_{10} can be 1,2,3\n\ny_{15} need to be 9.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9 in 5 steps? The values y_{10} to y_{15}.\n\ny_{10} depends on action at t=9.\n\nIf at t=9 I take U, y_{10}=3\n\nThen I need to go from y=3 at t=10 to y=9 at t=15, which is 6 units up in 5 steps: actions at t=10 to t=14 affect y_{11} to y_{15}.\n\ny_{11} to y_{15}, 5 positions.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, need +6, but with 5 actions, I can increase at most 5, so y_{15} <= y_{10} +5 =3+5=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + Δy_{9}, y_9=2, so if U, y_{10}=3.\n\nThen y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}, and so on, up to y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}.\n\ny_{15} = y_{10} + sum_{k=10}^{14} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy_k <=1, so sum <=5, so y_{15} <= y_{10} +5\n\nIf y_{10}=3, then y_{15} <=8 <9.\n\nIf at t=9 I take S, y_{10}=2, then y_{15} <= 2 +5 =7 <9.\n\nIf I take D, y_{10}=1, y_{15} <=1+5=6<9.\n\nThus, from y=2 at t=9, with actions up to t=14, I can reach at most y=8 at t=15, or y=9 only if I start higher, but I can't.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 before turn t=16 from this start.\n\nThus, minimal H=10, with y=9 at turn 16.\n\nSo the action sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the output, for the given t_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16\\) ensures that the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 16 without colliding with any cars.\n\n### Key Points for Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\):** No collision at any turn, as the cars never cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\):** Collision occurs only at turn \\(t = 9\\) (i.e., \\(T = 9\\)). Thus, the player must not be on \\(y = 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at turn 9.\n- **Freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\):** Collision occurs at turns \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\). Thus, the player must not be on \\(y = 6, 7,\\) or \\(8\\) at turns 11 and 12.\n\n### Optimal Path and Actions:\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\(y = 1\\). Moving up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8 avoids immediate issues.\n- At turn 8, staying at \\(y = 2\\) ensures the player is not on \\(y = 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at turn 9.\n- Starting from turn 9, the player moves up sequentially. By turn 10, the player is on \\(y = 3\\), which is safe after turn 9. Similarly, \\(y = 4\\) and \\(y = 5\\) are safe after turn 9.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13, after the dangerous turns 11 and 12, so it is safe. The same applies for \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15.\n- Finally, moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16 completes the path.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) to 10, with actions from turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16\\) (i.e., turns 7 to 15). The actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 7:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8). Position at turn 8: (0, 2), safe.\n- **Turn 8:** Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\)). Position at turn 9: (0, 2), safe and avoids \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 10). Position at turn 10: (0, 3), safe (after turn 9).\n- **Turn 10:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 11). Position at turn 11: (0, 4), safe (after turn 9).\n- **Turn 11:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 12). Position at turn 12: (0, 5), safe (after turn 9) and avoids \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) at turns 11-12.\n- **Turn 12:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13). Position at turn 13: (0, 6), safe (after turn 12).\n- **Turn 13:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14). Position at turn 14: (0, 7), safe (after turn 12).\n- **Turn 14:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15). Position at turn 15: (0, 8), safe (after turn 12).\n- **Turn 15:** Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16). Position at turn 16: (0, 9), goal reached.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 10\\) turns, and no shorter path is possible due to the collision constraints at turns 9, 11, and 12.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\, U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: The player moves vertically (y-axis) and the cars move horizontally (x-axis) on their respective freeways (y=1 to 8). The player is at x=0 always.\n\nThe player update:\n  - Action U: y += 1\n  - Action D: y -= 1\n  - Action S: y stays\n\nConstraints: y must be in [0,9]. So if at y=0 and we try to go down, we stay? But note the problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 0 and do D, we remain at 0. Similarly, at 9 and U, we remain at 9.\n\nThe car update:\n  - For a left-moving car: at turn t1, the car's head is at h and tail at tau (with h > tau, and the car spans [tau, h] ?). Actually, the problem says:\n      For left: at turn t1: span = [h, tau] -> then at turn T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    But note: if the car is left-moving, it moves to the left (decreasing x). The head is the front? So if the car is moving left, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the representation is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n  Let me interpret:\n    - Left-moving: the head is the front, so when moving left, the head is the rightmost point? But the problem says for left: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n    Since the car is moving left, the entire segment moves left. The head (which was at h) becomes h - s*(T-t1), and the tail (which was at tau) becomes tau - s*(T-t1). So the car spans [min, max]? Actually, the problem writes [h, tau] for left, but note that if h is the head and the car is moving left, then h should be greater than tau? Or is h the leftmost?\n\n  But note the example: \n      For a left-moving car: at t1, span is [48,83]? That would be from 48 to 83? But then moving left: at T, [48 - s*(T-t1), 83 - s*(T-t1)] -> which is [48-36*(T-t1), 83-36*(T-t1)]. This is decreasing. But note: 48 < 83, so the car is from 48 to 83? Then when moving left, the entire segment moves left. So the head (the front) is at 83? But the problem says \"head at h\", so in this case h=48? That doesn't seem like the front.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might have defined the head as the front in the direction of travel. For a left-moving car, the front (head) would be the leftmost point? But then if the car is moving left, the head should be at a smaller x? Then the tail is at a larger x? So the span would be [head, tail] = [h, tau] with h < tau? But the given data for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). 48 < 83, so if the car is left-moving, then the head (front) is at 48 and the tail at 83? Then when moving left, the head moves to 48 - s*(T-t1) and the tail moves to 83 - s*(T-t1). Then the car covers [48 - s*(T-t1), 83 - s*(T-t1)]. But that means the car is from 48 to 83 (a positive length) and then moving left.\n\n  Similarly, for a right-moving car: [tau, head] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. The given data for freeway 3: (24,13,right,12) -> but note: head=24, tail=13? Then the car is from 13 to 24? Then when moving right: becomes [13+12*(T-t1), 24+12*(T-t1)].\n\n  However, the problem states for right-moving: \n      \"Span(t1) = [tau, head] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n  So in freeway 3, the first car: head=24, tail=13 -> so the car spans [13,24] at t1? Then at T: [13+12*(T-8), 24+12*(T-8)].\n\n  But note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\" meaning that at t1 the car goes from tau to head? Then head is the front? So the car is moving right, so the front (head) is at 24 and the tail at 13? Then the car is from 13 to 24, and the front is at 24? That makes sense.\n\n  So in summary:\n    - Left-moving car: represented as (head, tail, left, speed) -> the head is the front (which is the leftmost point for a left-moving car) and the tail is the rear (rightmost). Then the car spans [head, tail] (but note: if the car is left-moving, then head < tail? because the front is at a smaller x). Actually, in the example: freeway1: (48,83,left,36) -> so head=48, tail=83 -> so the car spans [48,83] (from 48 to 83). Then when moving left, both decrease: [48 - 36*(T-8), 83 - 36*(T-8)].\n\n    - Right-moving car: represented as (head, tail, right, speed) -> the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). The car spans [tail, head] (so from tail to head). Example: (24,13,right,12) -> head=24, tail=13 -> the car spans [13,24]. Then moving right: [13+12*(T-8), 24+12*(T-8)].\n\n  However, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\" and then becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), head+s*(T-t1)]. So we can compute the car's position at any turn T.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T contains 0? That is, if the car's span [L, R] at turn T satisfies L <= 0 <= R.\n\nImportant note: The player is only on the freeway at turn T if at that turn T, the player's y-coordinate is that freeway. And note: the player moves at the same time as the cars? Actually, the update for the player is: at turn t, we choose an action a_t, then at the next turn t+1, the player's position becomes (0, y_{t+1}). But when does the collision check happen?\n\nThe problem states: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T, which will lead to y_{T+1} at turn T+1. But at turn T, we are still at y_T, so we check for collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events at turn T:\n  1. We are at position (0, y_T) at the beginning of the turn (or at the moment of the turn).\n  2. We choose an action a_T (U, D, S).\n  3. The cars on every freeway move (update their positions) to turn T (if they haven't already? But note: the update for the cars is given for T>t1, and we start at t1=8).\n  4. Then we check: if the player is on a freeway (y_T in [1,8]), then we check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\n  Then we update the player: \n        y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, clamped to [0,9].\n\nSo the collision check happens at the same turn T, and we are at y_T at that time.\n\nOur goal: we start at turn 8 at (0,2). We want to reach (0,9) as soon as possible (minimal H, meaning minimal number of turns from the current turn).\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn 8 to turn 8+H-1 (so H actions) such that after the last action (at turn 8+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (1..8) at turn T if any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nNote: at turn 8, we start at (0,2). Then we must check: is there a collision at turn 8 on freeway 2? Let's compute the cars on freeway 2 at turn 8.\n\nFreeway 2: (48,83,left,36) -> one car: at turn 8, the car is at [48,83]? But we are at x=0. Since 48>0 and 83>0, 0 is not in [48,83]. So no collision at turn 8.\n\nBut note: the car update for T=t1 (which is 8) is just the initial state.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move from y=2 to y=9, avoiding collisions at every turn we are on a freeway.\n\nWe are allowed to wait (S) or even go down (D) if needed to avoid collisions.\n\nWe want the minimal H.\n\nThe direct way: we need to move up 7 steps (from 2 to 9). But we might have to wait sometimes to avoid collisions. So H might be more than 7.\n\nWe need to simulate the car movements and the player movements from turn 8 onward.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t. We start at t=8, y=2.\n\nWe will simulate for t=8,9,10,... until we reach y=9.\n\nBut we need to check at each turn t (if we are on a freeway y in [1,8]) whether the car on that freeway (if any) has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to 8). Each freeway has one or more cars. We must compute for each car on the freeway we are on at turn t, the span at turn t.\n\nThe cars are updated as:\n\nFor a car on freeway k, given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 8, then at turn t (t>=8):\n\n  if direction == 'left':\n      head(t) = head0 - 36*(t-8)   [for freeways 1 and 2, since speed=36]\n      tail(t) = tail0 - 36*(t-8)\n      The car spans [head(t), tail(t)]? But note: in the initial state for freeway1: head0=48, tail0=83 -> so at turn t: [48-36*(t-8), 83-36*(t-8)]\n\n  However, note: the problem says for left: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> so the span is [head0 - s*(t-8), tail0 - s*(t-8)]. But is the span [min, max]? Actually, at t=8: [48,83] -> so min=48, max=83. Then at t=9: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47]. \n\n  Similarly, for a right-moving car: \n        tail(t) = tail0 + s*(t-8)\n        head(t) = head0 + s*(t-8)\n      So the span is [tail0 + s*(t-8), head0 + s*(t-8)]\n\nBut note: for freeway 3,4,5: \n    cars: (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFor the first car: head0=24, tail0=13 -> so at turn t: [13+12*(t-8), 24+12*(t-8)]\n\nFor the second: head0=-12, tail0=-23 -> [ -23+12*(t-8), -12+12*(t-8) ]\n\nFor the third: head0=-48, tail0=-59 -> [ -59+12*(t-8), -48+12*(t-8) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 have cars with speed 6.\n\nFreeway 6: (-18,-29,right,6) -> [ -29+6*(t-8), -18+6*(t-8) ]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-18,-29,right,6) and (48,37,right,6) -> wait, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nFor the second car on freeway8: (48,37,right,6). But note: for a right-moving car, the head is the front? Then the car should be from tail to head, so from 37 to 48? Then at turn t: [37+6*(t-8), 48+6*(t-8)]\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right: \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\" and then [tau+s*(T-t1), head+s*(T-t1)]. So for (48,37,right,6): at t1=8, the car spans [37,48]. Then at turn t: [37+6*(t-8), 48+6*(t-8)]\n\nWe are going to simulate for t starting at 8. We want to know when the car spans on a particular freeway contain 0.\n\nWe are at (0,2) at turn 8. Then we choose an action for turn 8, which will lead to y_9 = y_8 + delta (if we choose U: then y9=3, D: y9=1, S: y9=2). But note: after the action at turn 8, we are at turn 9 with y= (2+delta). Then at turn 9, we are at y9, and we check for collision on freeway y9 at turn 9? Actually, no: the collision check at turn 8: we are at y=2 (freeway2) at turn 8. Then after the action, we move to turn 9 and become at y9, and then at turn 9 we check for collision on freeway y9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: \n  - Start: (0,2)\n  - Check collision on freeway 2 at turn 8: freeway2 has one car: [48,83] at t=8 -> 0 not in [48,83] -> safe.\n  - Choose action a8 (U, D, or S). Let's say we choose U: then y9=3.\n\nTurn 9:\n  - Start: (0,3)\n  - Check collision on freeway 3 at turn 9: freeway3 has three cars. Compute their spans at t=9 (which is 1 step after t1=8).\n\n      For the first car: [13+12*(9-8), 24+12*(9-8)] = [13+12, 24+12] = [25,36] -> 0 not in [25,36]\n      Second car: [-23+12*(1), -12+12*(1)] = [-11, 0] -> note: -11<=0<=0 -> so 0 is included? \n          But wait: the interval is [a,b] inclusive? The problem says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\". The span is a closed interval? Since it's a continuous set? But the problem uses integers? Actually, the grid is integers? The x-coordinates are integers? The problem says \"on a 2D grid\" and the freeways are at integer y. The car positions are given as integers. So we assume the car spans are integer intervals.\n\n          So the second car at t=9: [-11, 0] -> and 0 is in that interval. Therefore, if we are on freeway3 at turn9, we collide.\n\n      Third car: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So if we go to freeway3 at turn9, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot choose U at turn8? Or we must avoid being on freeway3 at turn9? \n\nBut note: we have to get to y=9. We cannot avoid freeway3 forever? We can wait at y=2? Or go down? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose to not move (S) at turn8: then at turn9 we are still at y=2. Then we check at turn9: freeway2 at turn9.\n\nFreeway2 at turn9: car: [48-36*(1), 83-36*(1)] = [12,47] -> 0 not in. So safe.\n\nThen at turn9 we can choose an action.\n\nBut we need to get to 9. We have to go through freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8. We must avoid being on a freeway when a car is covering 0.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each turn (starting from t=8) when the freeway is safe (i.e., no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn).\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for a range of turns (from t=8 up to a sufficiently large t) whether the freeway k is safe at turn t.\n\nWe'll compute a function safe(k, t) that returns True if at turn t, freeway k has no car that covers 0, else False.\n\nWe do:\n\nFor freeway1: only one car: (48,83,left,36)\n   span at t: [48-36*(t-8), 83-36*(t-8)]\n   We need: 0 in [48-36*(t-8), 83-36*(t-8)]?\n        => 48-36*(t-8) <= 0 <= 83-36*(t-8)\n        Solve:\n          Lower bound: 48-36*(t-8) <= 0 -> 36*(t-8) >= 48 -> t-8 >= 48/36 = 4/3 -> t>= 8+4/3 ≈ 9.33 -> so t>=10? \n          Upper bound: 0 <= 83-36*(t-8) -> 36*(t-8) <= 83 -> t-8 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> t<=10.305 -> so t<=10.\n\n        Therefore, for integer t: t=10 is the only integer in [9.33, 10.305]? \n        Check t=10: \n            lower = 48-36*(2)=48-72=-24\n            upper = 83-72=11\n            So 0 is in [-24,11] -> yes.\n\n        So freeway1 is unsafe at t=10.\n\n        For t<10: \n            t=8: [48,83] -> safe\n            t=9: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> safe\n            t=10: unsafe\n            t=11: [48-36*3=48-108=-60, 83-108=-25] -> 0 is not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway1: unsafe at t=10, safe otherwise? But we only care about t>=8.\n\nFor freeway2: same as freeway1? \n   (48,83,left,36) -> same as freeway1: unsafe at t=10, safe at other t.\n\nFor freeway3: three cars.\n\n  Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> span at t: [13+12*(t-8), 24+12*(t-8)]\n        Check if 0 in [13+12*(t-8), 24+12*(t-8)]?\n        => 13+12*(t-8) <= 0 <= 24+12*(t-8)\n\n        Lower: 13+12*(t-8)<=0 -> 12*(t-8) <= -13 -> t-8 <= -13/12 ≈ -1.08 -> impossible? so never unsafe? \n        Actually, at t=8: [13,24] -> positive, so safe.\n\n  Car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> span: [-23+12*(t-8), -12+12*(t-8)]\n        Check: \n          -23+12*(t-8) <= 0 <= -12+12*(t-8)\n          => 0 <= -12+12*(t-8) -> 12*(t-8) >= 12 -> t-8>=1 -> t>=9\n          and -23+12*(t-8) <=0 -> 12*(t-8)<=23 -> t-8<=23/12≈1.916 -> t<=9.916 -> so t=9.\n\n        At t=9: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n            The interval is [-11,0]. Since the car spans from -11 to 0, and the player is at 0, that is included.\n\n        So unsafe at t=9.\n\n        At t=10: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  Car3: (-48,-59,right,12) -> span: [-59+12*(t-8), -48+12*(t-8)]\n        Check: \n          -59+12*(t-8) <= 0 <= -48+12*(t-8)\n          => 0 <= -48+12*(t-8) -> 12*(t-8)>=48 -> t-8>=4 -> t>=12\n          and -59+12*(t-8)<=0 -> 12*(t-8)<=59 -> t-8<=59/12≈4.916 -> t<=12.916 -> so t=12.\n\n        At t=12: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        At t=13: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So unsafe at t=12.\n\n  Therefore, freeway3 is unsafe at t=9 and t=12. Safe at other t (at least for t=8,10,11,13,...).\n\nFor freeway4: same as freeway3? \n   The cars are: (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12) -> same as freeway3.\n   So unsafe at t=9 and t=12.\n\nFor freeway5: same as freeway3 -> unsafe at t=9 and t=12.\n\nFor freeway6: one car: (-18,-29,right,6)\n   span: [-29+6*(t-8), -18+6*(t-8)]\n   Check: \n        -29+6*(t-8) <= 0 <= -18+6*(t-8)\n        => 0 <= -18+6*(t-8) -> 6*(t-8)>=18 -> t-8>=3 -> t>=11\n        and -29+6*(t-8)<=0 -> 6*(t-8)<=29 -> t-8<=29/6≈4.833 -> t<=12.833 -> so t=11,12.\n\n        At t=11: [-29+6*3, -18+6*3] = [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n        At t=12: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in? yes, so unsafe.\n\n        At t=13: [-29+30, -18+30] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nFor freeway7: same as freeway6 -> unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nFor freeway8: two cars.\n   Car1: (-18,-29,right,6) -> same as above: unsafe at t=11,12.\n   Car2: (48,37,right,6) -> wait: head=48, tail=37? \n        For a right-moving car: span at t: [37+6*(t-8), 48+6*(t-8)]\n        Check: 37+6*(t-8) <= 0 <= 48+6*(t-8) -> \n          This requires 37+6*(t-8) <= 0 -> 6*(t-8)<=-37 -> impossible? \n        So safe for this car.\n\n        Therefore, freeway8: unsafe at t=11,12 (because of the first car) and safe for other t.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at t=10\nFreeway2: unsafe at t=10\nFreeway3: unsafe at t=9,12\nFreeway4: unsafe at t=9,12\nFreeway5: unsafe at t=9,12\nFreeway6: unsafe at t=11,12\nFreeway7: unsafe at t=11,12\nFreeway8: unsafe at t=11,12\n\nWe start at turn8 at y=2.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway2 at turn8? But at turn8 we are at y=2 (freeway2) and we computed that freeway2 is safe at t=8.\n\nWe are going to plan a path from y=2 to y=9, and we can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns from t=8 to the turn when we first reach y=9).\n\nThe minimal H without any obstacles is 7 (from 2 to 9: 7 steps up). But we have obstacles.\n\nWe can use BFS or dynamic programming to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe define state: (t, y) where t is the current turn and y is the current position.\n\nWe start: (8,2)\n\nWe want to reach (t, 9) for some t.\n\nAt each state (t,y), we consider actions: U, D, S -> leads to y_next = y + delta (clamped to [0,9]) and then we move to turn t+1.\n\nBut note: when we are at state (t,y), we have already passed the collision check at turn t? Actually, we start at (8,2) and we are checked at turn8 and safe. Then we choose an action for turn8, and then we go to turn9 with y_next. Then at turn9, we check: if y_next is in [1,8] (i.e., a freeway) then we must check if freeway y_next is safe at turn9.\n\nSo the transition: \n   from (t,y) we choose an action a, which gives y_next = min(max(y+delta,0),9)\n   then we check: if y_next is in [1,8] (freeway) then we require that the freeway y_next is safe at turn t+1.\n\n   If it is safe, then we can go to (t+1, y_next).\n\n   If y_next is 0 or 9, then no collision check (since not a freeway).\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we reach y=9 at turn = 8 + H - 1? Actually, the actions are taken from turn8 to turn8+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn8+H.\n\nBut note: the problem says: we are to find H and a sequence of actions from t=t1 to t1+H-1 (so H actions) and at the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we reach (0,9). Then the turn when we are at (0,9) is t1+H-1? But after the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions: \n   at turn t1 (8): first action -> leads to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n   at turn t1+1: second action -> leads to y_{t1+2} at turn t1+2.\n   ...\n   at turn t1+H-1: the H-th action -> leads to y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nRe-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1: so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}. And after the last action (a_{t1+H-1}) we have the position at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: the update: after action a_t, the position becomes y_{t+1}. So:\n\n   After a_{t1} (at turn t1), we get y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n   After a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1), we get y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> wait, no: the problem says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"? \n\nActually: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and ... to reach (0,9)\" and the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning from t1 to t1+H-1. And the condition is that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). But by the update, the position after the action at turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H}. So we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" in the state? \n\nLet me check: \n   We start at turn t1 at (0,y_{t1}). \n   Then we do action a_{t1} -> becomes y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n   Then ... until a_{t1+H-1} -> becomes y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we have reached? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nNo, it says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is not written. It says: \"minimal number of turns H and ... to reach (0,9)\". \n\nBut in the answer format, we output the actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the player update: after the action at turn t, the position at turn t+1 becomes y_{t+1}. \n\nSo after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the position at turn t1+H is 9.\n\nTherefore, we require to have y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}. And we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H? Because the sequence has H actions.\n\nSo we are done when we are at y=9 at the beginning of a turn? Actually, no: the problem doesn't require to avoid collision at the goal? But the goal is at freeway? No, y=9 is the top, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8). So at y=9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we want to minimize H (the number of actions) such that we start at turn8 (y=2) and after H actions we are at y=9 at turn8+H.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every intermediate turn: for any turn t in [8, 8+H-1] (because at turn t, we are at y_t, and if y_t is in [1,8] then we require that the freeway y_t is safe at turn t).\n\nNote: at the last turn, when we are at turn8+H, we are at y=9 (safe) and we don't take an action that turn? Actually, we have taken H actions and we are done.\n\nSo we simulate from turn8 to turn8+H, and we are at y_t at turn t (for t from 8 to 8+H). We require:\n   - For t=8: y8=2 (given) -> and we check collision at turn8: freeway2 is safe.\n   - For t from 9 to 8+H-1: if y_t in [1,8] then the freeway must be safe at turn t.\n   - At t=8+H: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nWe are going to do BFS in the state (t,y) for t>=8 and y in [0,9]. We start at (8,2) and we want to reach any (t,9) for some t.\n\nThe cost is the number of actions: H = (t - 8) because we start at turn8 and we are at turn t at the end. But note: we require that after H actions we are at turn8+H, so H = (t - 8). And we want minimal H, so minimal t.\n\nWe can use Dijkstra? Actually, each step we advance t by 1, so we can do BFS by t.\n\nWe simulate by increasing t.\n\nWe'll create an array for t from 8 up to a sufficiently large value (say 20) and for y from 0 to 9.\n\nWe'll keep a 2D array: dist[t][y] = minimal steps (H) to be at (t,y) and have taken (t-8) actions? Actually, we are counting the number of actions taken to get to that state. But note: we start at (8,2) with 0 actions. Then at (9, y1) we have taken 1 action, etc.\n\nBut we want to minimize the total actions H such that we are at (t,9) and H = t-8.\n\nSo we want the minimal t such that we can be at (t,9) without any collision in the path.\n\nWe'll simulate t from 8 to ... until we find a path to y=9.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Let visited[t][y] = whether we can be at (t,y) without collision at all turns from 8 to t (if applicable).\n\n  Start: \n        t=8, y=2 -> safe (we checked freeway2 at t=8: safe) -> so set visited[8][2]=True.\n\n  Then for t from 8 to ...:\n        For each state (t,y) that is visited, we consider the next action: U, D, S -> which leads to next_y = y + delta (clamped to [0,9]), and then we are at (t+1, next_y).\n\n        But then at (t+1, next_y): we must check:\n             - If next_y is in [1,8] (freeway) then we require that freeway next_y is safe at turn t+1.\n             - If next_y is 0 or 9, then safe.\n\n        If safe, then mark visited[t+1][next_y] = True, and record the action that led to it.\n\n        If we reach (t+1,9), then we have found H = (t+1 - 8) = t-7.\n\n        But note: we started at turn8, and after H actions we are at turn8+H. So if we are at (t,9), then H = t - 8.\n\n        We want the minimal H, so we break at the first t we get to y=9.\n\n  We need to record the path.\n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS by t.\n\nAlternatively, since the grid is small (10 states) and t increases by 1, we can iterate t from 8 to 20.\n\nLet me set up:\n\n   We'll create an array for t from 8 to 20 (we can go beyond 20 if needed) and for y in 0..9.\n\n   We'll have a 2D array: parent[t][y] = (prev_t, prev_y, action) \n        where at turn prev_t, we were at prev_y and we took the action that led to (t,y).\n\n   Since we move from t to t+1, then prev_t = t-1.\n\n   So we can store: from (t-1, y_prev) with action a, we got to (t,y).\n\n   Then at the end, we can backtrack.\n\nSteps:\n\n   Initialize:\n        Let dist[t][y] = infinity for all, except dist[8][2]=0.\n        Let parent[8][2] = None.\n\n        Queue: we start with (8,2).\n\n   Then for each state (t,y) we pop, we consider next state: t_next = t+1, and y_next in {y, y+1, y-1} (clamped to [0,9] and corresponding to S, U, D).\n\n        For each action a (U,D,S) and resulting y_next (clamped):\n            If y_next is in [1,8]: check if freeway y_next is safe at turn t_next = t+1.\n            Else (y_next=0 or 9): safe.\n\n            If safe, then if we haven't visited (t_next, y_next) then we push it and set:\n                 dist[t_next][y_next] = dist[t][y] + 1\n                 parent[t_next][y_next] = (t,y,a)   # meaning we came from (t,y) by taking action a to get to (t_next, y_next)\n\n        If we reach y_next=9, then we break and output the path.\n\nWe want the minimal H = dist[t_next][9] = (t_next - 8). And we want the minimal t_next? Since we are doing BFS by time, the first time we hit y=9 is minimal H.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple paths and we want the minimal H. Since each action increases t by 1, the minimal H is the minimal t_next-8.\n\nSo we iterate t from 8 to ... until we find a path to 9.\n\nWe'll simulate until t=20, which should be enough.\n\nNow, we code the safety check for freeway k at turn t:\n\n   We have the unsafe times per freeway:\n\n   We can precompute a 2D array: unsafe[t][k] for t in [8,20] and k in [1,8] (freeways).\n\n   Then the safety at (t,k) is: not unsafe[t][k] (if we have any unsafe time for k at t, then unsafe).\n\n   But note: a freeway may have multiple cars. We computed above the unsafe times per freeway.\n\n   We can define:\n\n        unsafe_times = {\n            1: [10],\n            2: [10],\n            3: [9,12],\n            4: [9,12],\n            5: [9,12],\n            6: [11,12],\n            7: [11,12],\n            8: [11,12]\n        }\n\n   Then for a given (t, k): \n        if k in [1,8] and t in unsafe_times[k]: then unsafe -> collision if we are there.\n        else safe.\n\n   However, note: for freeway8, we have two cars. We computed that the second car is always safe? But the unsafe_times we computed for freeway8 only considered the first car? Actually, we computed that the first car causes unsafe at t=11,12 and the second car is always safe. So overall freeway8 is unsafe at t=11,12.\n\n   So the above unsafe_times is correct.\n\n   But note: we must check for every car? Actually, we already did and we know the freeway is unsafe at those times.\n\nNow, we simulate:\n\n   t from 8 to 20.\n\n   We start at (8,2).\n\n   Then for each state (t,y) we consider next state (t+1, y_next) for y_next in {y-1, y, y+1} (clamped to [0,9]).\n\n   Then if y_next in [1,8] and t+1 is in unsafe_times[y_next] -> skip (because collision)\n   else -> we can go to (t+1, y_next).\n\n   We break when we set (t,9) for the first time.\n\n   Then backtrack to get the actions.\n\nLet's do it manually to see the minimal path.\n\nWe start at t=8, y=2.\n\nAt t=8: we are at (8,2) -> safe.\n\nThen we choose an action for turn8 (which will lead to t9).\n\nOptions at t8: \n   U: y9 = 3 -> then at t9, we are at freeway3 -> but freeway3 at t9 is unsafe (t9=9 is unsafe for freeway3) -> collision -> not allowed.\n   D: y9 = 1 -> freeway1 at t9: unsafe? freeway1 unsafe at t=10 only -> so at t9: safe. -> allowed.\n   S: y9 = 2 -> freeway2 at t9: unsafe? freeway2 unsafe at t10 only -> safe. -> allowed.\n\nSo from (8,2): \n   action D -> (9,1)\n   action S -> (9,2)\n\nWe do not consider U.\n\nNow, at t=9:\n\n   State (9,1): freeway1 at t9: safe? (unsafe only at t10) -> safe.\n        Then actions:\n           U: y10=2 -> freeway2 at t10: unsafe! (freeway2 unsafe at t10) -> collision -> skip.\n           D: y10=0 -> safe (not freeway) -> allowed.\n           S: y10=1 -> freeway1 at t10: unsafe -> skip.\n\n        So from (9,1): \n            D -> (10,0)\n            U and S are not allowed.\n\n   State (9,2): freeway2 at t9: safe (only unsafe at t10) -> safe.\n        Then actions:\n           U: y10=3 -> freeway3 at t10: unsafe? freeway3 unsafe at t9 and t12 -> at t10: safe -> allowed.\n           D: y10=1 -> freeway1 at t10: unsafe -> skip.\n           S: y10=2 -> freeway2 at t10: unsafe -> skip.\n\n        So from (9,2): \n            U -> (10,3)\n\nNow, at t=10:\n\n   State (10,0): safe (not freeway). Actions:\n        U: y11=1 -> freeway1 at t11: safe? freeway1 unsafe only at t10 -> so safe -> allowed.\n        D: remains at 0 -> safe -> allowed.\n        S: remains at 0 -> safe.\n\n        But we want to go to 9, so we consider U.\n\n        So (10,0): \n            U -> (11,1)\n\n   State (10,3): freeway3 at t10: safe? (unsafe at t9,12 -> so safe). Actions:\n        U: y11=4 -> freeway4 at t11: unsafe? freeway4 unsafe at t9 and t12 -> at t11: safe -> allowed.\n        D: y11=2 -> freeway2 at t11: safe (only unsafe at t10) -> allowed.\n        S: y11=3 -> freeway3 at t11: safe -> allowed.\n\n        So from (10,3): \n            U -> (11,4)\n            D -> (11,2)\n            S -> (11,3)\n\nNow, t=11:\n\n   State (11,1): freeway1 at t11: safe. Actions:\n        U: y12=2 -> freeway2 at t12: unsafe? freeway2 unsafe at t10? not at t12 -> safe? \n            But we computed freeway2 unsafe only at t10. So safe. -> allowed.\n        D: y12=0 -> safe.\n        S: y12=1 -> freeway1 at t12: safe? freeway1 unsafe only at t10 -> safe.\n\n        So: \n            U -> (12,2)\n            D -> (12,0)\n            S -> (12,1)\n\n   State (11,2): freeway2 at t11: safe. Actions:\n        U: y12=3 -> freeway3 at t12: unsafe! (freeway3 unsafe at t12) -> skip.\n        D: y12=1 -> freeway1: safe -> allowed.\n        S: y12=2 -> freeway2: safe -> allowed.\n\n        So: \n            D -> (12,1)\n            S -> (12,2)\n\n   State (11,3): freeway3 at t11: safe. Actions:\n        U: y12=4 -> freeway4 at t12: unsafe! -> skip.\n        D: y12=2 -> freeway2: safe -> allowed.\n        S: y12=3 -> freeway3: unsafe! (at t12) -> skip.\n\n        So: D -> (12,2)\n\n   State (11,4): freeway4 at t11: safe. Actions:\n        U: y12=5 -> freeway5 at t12: unsafe! -> skip.\n        D: y12=3 -> freeway3: unsafe! -> skip.\n        S: y12=4 -> freeway4: unsafe! -> skip.\n\n        So no action from (11,4) is allowed? Then we skip.\n\nNow, t=12:\n\n   We have states: (12,0), (12,1), (12,2) from above.\n\n   State (12,0): safe. Action: \n        U: (13,1) -> freeway1 at t13: safe -> allowed.\n\n   State (12,1): freeway1 at t12: safe. Actions:\n        U: (13,2) -> freeway2 at t13: safe -> allowed.\n        D: (13,0) -> safe.\n        S: (13,1) -> freeway1 at t13: safe.\n\n   State (12,2): freeway2 at t12: safe. Actions:\n        U: (13,3) -> freeway3 at t13: safe? (freeway3 unsafe at t9,12 -> so t13 safe) -> allowed.\n        D: (13,1) -> freeway1: safe -> allowed.\n        S: (13,2) -> freeway2: safe.\n\nNow, we are at t=13 and we have several states.\n\nBut note: we have not reached y=9 yet. We need to continue.\n\nHowever, we can see that we can start moving up.\n\nBut we want the minimal H. We are at t=13, so H = 13-8 = 5? But we are not at 9.\n\nAlternatively, we might have a faster path.\n\nWait, we have not reached 9 yet. We must continue.\n\nBut note: we might have missed a path that goes faster? \n\nLet me check: at t=9, we had two states: (9,1) and (9,2). Then at t=10: (10,0) and (10,3). Then at t=11: (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). Then at t=12: (12,0), (12,1), (12,2). Then at t=13: (13,0), (13,1), (13,2), (13,3).\n\nWe need to get to 9. We are at y=3 at t=13. Then we can go up: 6 steps to 9? So at least 6 more turns -> t=19.\n\nBut is there a path that reaches 9 earlier? \n\nLet me see: at t=10, we were at (10,3). Then we could have gone up at t10 to (11,4) -> but then at t11 we were at (11,4) and then we were stuck? Because at t12, freeway4 is unsafe? But we had to move: but we couldn't? So we skipped.\n\nAt t9, we were at (9,2) and we went up to (10,3). Then at t10, we could have gone down to (11,2)? Then at t11, we are at (11,2). Then at t11, we can go down to (12,1) or stay at (12,2). Then at t12, we can go up to (13,2) or (13,3). \n\nBut then at t13, we are at y=3. Then:\n\n   t13: at (13,3): \n        U: (14,4) -> freeway4 at t14: safe? freeway4 unsafe at t9,12 -> so safe -> allowed.\n        D: (14,2) -> safe.\n        S: (14,3) -> safe.\n\n   Then we can go up repeatedly.\n\nBut it will take at least 6 more steps: so total H= (13-8) + 6 = 5+6=11? And we are at turn13+6=19.\n\nBut we might be able to go faster if we avoid the unsafe times.\n\nHowever, note that freeways 6,7,8 are unsafe at t11,12. We are at t13, so they are safe at t13 and beyond.\n\nSo we can go through freeways 4,5,6,7,8 at t>=13 safely.\n\nSo from (13,3): \n   t13: U -> (14,4)\n   t14: U -> (15,5)\n   t15: U -> (16,6)\n   t16: U -> (17,7)\n   t17: U -> (18,8)\n   t18: U -> (19,9)\n\nSo we reach at t19.\n\nTotal H = 19-8 = 11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe must consider that we might have taken a different route.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, we went down to (9,1) and then to (10,0). Then at t10: we went up to (11,1). Then at t11: we could go up to (12,2) -> but at t11: (11,1): we can go up to (12,2) -> freeway2 at t12: safe? yes. Then at t12: we are at (12,2). Then we can go up to (13,3). Then same as above: 6 steps to 9 -> total turns: 13+6=19 -> same.\n\nAlternatively, at t11: (11,1): we go up to (12,2). Then at t12: (12,2) -> we can go up to (13,3). Then same.\n\nBut note: at t9, we also had the option to stay at (9,2). Then at t9: we went up to (10,3). Then at t10: we went down to (11,2) -> then at t11: (11,2) we go down to (12,1) -> then at t12: (12,1) we go up to (13,2). Then at t13: (13,2) we can go up to (14,3). Then 5 steps to 9: at t19 again.\n\nBut wait, can we go faster? \n\nWhat if we wait at some safe spot until the unsafe times pass? \n\nFor example, at t8: we go down to (9,1). Then at t9: we go down to (10,0). Then we wait at 0 for a few turns? Then go up.\n\nBut at 0, we can stay as long as we want. Then we can avoid the unsafe freeways at t10,11,12 by staying at 0 until t13.\n\nThen at t13: we are at (13,0). Then we can start going up.\n\nBut at t13: \n   (13,0): U -> (14,1) -> freeway1 at t14: safe -> allowed.\n   then (14,1): U -> (15,2) -> freeway2: safe.\n   then (15,3), (16,4), (17,5), (18,6), (19,7), (20,8), (21,9) -> that's 8 steps from (13,0) -> total turns: 13 + 8 = 21 -> H=13.\n\nBut we can go faster: from (13,0) to (14,1), (15,2), (16,3), (17,4), (18,5), (19,6), (20,7), (21,8), (22,9) -> 9 steps? Actually, 0 to 9: 9 steps? But we can go one per step.\n\nBut we can go up every step: 0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 9 steps. So from (13,0) to (22,9). H=14.\n\nAlternatively, we might leave 0 earlier? \n\nBut we must avoid freeways 1 and 2 at t10? Actually, freeway1 and 2 are unsafe only at t10. So at t11 they are safe. So we could leave 0 at t11: \n   t10: (10,0) -> then at t10 we choose U: to (11,1) -> freeway1 at t11: safe? yes -> allowed.\n   then at t11: (11,1): we can go U to (12,2) -> freeway2 at t12: safe? (only unsafe at t10) -> safe.\n   then at t12: (12,2): we can go U to (13,3) -> freeway3 at t13: safe.\n   then we go up: (14,4), (15,5), (16,6), (17,7), (18,8), (19,9) -> so at t19 we reach.\n\nThis is the same as before: H=11.\n\nBut we started at t8, and we are at t19 -> H=11.\n\nIs there a path that reaches 9 earlier? \n\nLet me try to go through freeways 3,4,5 at a safe time.\n\nThe unsafe times for freeway3,4,5 are t=9 and t=12. So we must avoid being on freeway3,4,5 at t=9 and t=12.\n\nWe are at t8: y=2.\n\nWe cannot go to freeway3 at t9 -> so we avoid going up at t8.\n\nThen we go down to (9,1) or stay at (9,2).\n\nAt t9: \n   if at (9,1): we can go down to (10,0) -> safe.\n   if at (9,2): we can go up to (10,3) -> safe (because freeway3 at t10 is safe).\n\nAt t10:\n   if at (10,0): then we go up to (11,1) -> freeway1 at t11: safe.\n   if at (10,3): then we can go up to (11,4) -> freeway4 at t11: safe.\n\nBut then at t11: \n   (11,1): we can go up to (12,2) -> freeway2 at t12: safe.\n   (11,4): we are stuck? Because at t12, freeway4 is unsafe. So we must leave freeway4 before t12? \n        At t11: we can go down to (12,3) -> freeway3 at t12: unsafe -> skip.\n        or stay: (12,4) -> freeway4 at t12: unsafe -> skip.\n        or up: (12,5) -> freeway5 at t12: unsafe -> skip.\n\nSo (11,4) is a dead end.\n\nTherefore, the only viable path from (10,3) is to go down to (11,2) or (11,3). But we had:\n\n   (10,3): \n        D: (11,2) -> freeway2 at t11: safe -> allowed.\n        S: (11,3) -> freeway3 at t11: safe -> allowed.\n\nThen at t11: \n   (11,2): \n        U: (12,3) -> freeway3 at t12: unsafe -> skip.\n        D: (12,1) -> freeway1: safe -> allowed.\n        S: (12,2) -> freeway2: safe -> allowed.\n\n   (11,3):\n        U: (12,4) -> freeway4: unsafe -> skip.\n        D: (12,2) -> safe -> allowed.\n        S: (12,3) -> unsafe -> skip.\n\nSo we can go to (12,1) or (12,2).\n\nThen at t12: \n   (12,1): \n        U: (13,2) -> freeway2: safe.\n        D: (13,0) -> safe.\n        S: (13,1) -> freeway1: safe.\n\n   (12,2):\n        U: (13,3) -> freeway3: safe (t13) -> allowed.\n        D: (13,1) -> safe.\n        S: (13,2) -> safe.\n\nThen at t13: we are at y=0,1,2, or 3.\n\nThe fastest to 9: from (13,3): 6 steps -> t19.\n\nFrom (13,0): 9 steps -> t22 -> slower.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we need to output the actions from turn8 to turn8+11-1 = turn18.\n\nWe have multiple paths. We need one.\n\nLet me pick one:\n\n   Start: (8,2)\n   We choose D -> (9,1)   [to avoid freeway3 at t9]\n   Then at t9: we choose D -> (10,0)   [because at t9, freeway1 is safe at t9, but then at t10 freeway1 is unsafe, so we go down to 0 to avoid]\n   Then at t10: we choose U -> (11,1)   [because at t11, freeway1 is safe]\n   Then at t11: we choose U -> (12,2)   [because we want to move up]\n   Then at t12: we choose U -> (13,3)\n   Then we go up every step: \n        t13: U -> (14,4)\n        t14: U -> (15,5)\n        t15: U -> (16,6)\n        t16: U -> (17,7)\n        t17: U -> (18,8)\n        t18: U -> (19,9) -> done.\n\nSo the actions from turn8 to turn18:\n\n   turn8: D\n   turn9: D\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: U\n   turn15: U\n   turn16: U\n   turn17: U\n   turn18: U\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nBut wait, at turn18: we are at (19,9) -> so we have reached at turn19. But the last action is at turn18. So we have taken 11 actions: turns 8 to 18.\n\nIs there a shorter path? We don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, we could have:\n\n   (8,2): S -> (9,2)\n   (9,2): U -> (10,3)   [freeway3 at t10: safe]\n   (10,3): D -> (11,2)   [freeway2 at t11: safe]\n   (11,2): S -> (12,2)   [freeway2 at t12: safe]\n   (12,2): U -> (13,3)\n   then same: U every step until (19,9)\n\nThis is also 11 actions.\n\nBut in this path, at turn11 we did S (stay) at y=2, so we didn't progress.\n\nWe can try to go faster:\n\n   (8,2): D -> (9,1)\n   (9,1): D -> (10,0)\n   (10,0): U -> (11,1)\n   (11,1): U -> (12,2)\n   (12,2): U -> (13,3)\n   then U every step: same as above.\n\nBut can we go from (11,1) to (12,3) at t12? \n   At t11: (11,1): if we choose U twice? But we can only choose one action per turn.\n   We choose U at t11: to (12,2). Then at t12: we choose U: to (13,3).\n\nSo we cannot skip.\n\nAnother idea: at t10: (10,0) we stay? \n   Then at t10: S -> (11,0) -> safe.\n   Then at t11: U -> (12,1) -> freeway1 at t12: safe.\n   Then at t12: U -> (13,2) -> freeway2: safe.\n   Then at t13: U -> (14,3) -> then 5 steps: (15,4)...(19,9) -> that's 11 actions too.\n\nSo no shorter.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we output the actions for turn8 to turn18.\n\nWe choose the first path we described:\n\n   turn8: D\n   turn9: D\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: U\n   turn15: U\n   turn16: U\n   turn17: U\n   turn18: U\n\nBut we must write the answer in the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says the current turn is t1 (which is 8), and we output from turn8 to turn8+H-1, and H=11, so the last turn is 8+10=18? \n\nYes, because the actions are for turns: 8,9,10,...,18 (which is 11 actions).\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut let me verify collision for this path:\n\n   t8: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (t8: freeway2 safe)\n   t9: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe (t9: freeway1 safe? unsafe at t10 only -> safe)\n   t10: y=0 -> safe\n   t11: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe (t11: freeway1 safe)\n   t12: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (t12: freeway2 safe)\n   t13: y=3 (freeway3) -> safe (t13: freeway3 safe? unsafe at t9,12 -> so safe)\n   t14: y=4 (freeway4) -> safe (only unsafe at t9,12 -> safe)\n   t15: y=5 (freeway5) -> safe\n   t16: y=6 (freeway6) -> safe (unsafe at t11,12 -> safe at t16)\n   t17: y=7 (freeway7) -> safe\n   t18: y=8 (freeway8) -> safe (unsafe at t11,12 -> safe at t18)\n\nThen at t19: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 8 is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down to avoid freeway 3 at turn 9, then moving to \\(y = 0\\) to avoid freeway 1 at turn 10, and then moving up consistently, ensuring that the player is not on any freeway when a car spans \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 8, move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 9, move down (D) to \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\).\n- From turn 13 to turn 18, move up (U) each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 8, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2) is safe (no car spans \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 9, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) is safe.\n- At turn 10, \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway, so safe.\n- At turn 11, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) is safe.\n- At turn 12, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2) is safe.\n- At turn 13, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3) is safe.\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4) is safe.\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5) is safe.\n- At turn 16, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6) is safe.\n- At turn 17, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7) is safe.\n- At turn 18, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8) is safe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player moves vertically: up, down, or stay, and the cars move horizontally on their lanes. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for a car on that freeway, the x=0 is within its span at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to t_1, which is turn 9. The cars move at constant speeds, so I can compute their positions at any future turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity, since t_1 is given as 9, but I'll think in terms of turns from now. So at turn 0 (which is t_1=9), player is at y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), S (stay, y unchanged). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, the car states:\n\nFor each freeway, k=1 to 8, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: left or right. Left means decreasing x, right means increasing x.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head is larger than tail I think? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h should be greater than τ? But in the example, for k=1: (12,47,left,36) — 12 and 47, if left-moving, and [12,47], but 12<47, so if it moves left, x decreases, so at T, [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT], which makes sense.\n\nBut [12,47] with 12<47, so head at 12, tail at 47? That seems odd because usually head is front, but for left-moving, if head is at smaller x, tail at larger x, but as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn the collision condition, it says \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so we care when x=0 is between the min and max of the span.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], with τ < h I assume.\n\nIn k=3, (36,25,right,12) — but 36 and 25, if right-moving, Span should be [τ,h] with τ<h, but 36>25, so probably it's (head, tail), and for right, head > tail? I think there might be inconsistency.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the table, for k=1: (12,47,left,36) so h=12, τ=47. Since left-moving, Span at t_1 is [12,47], which from 12 to 47, so min=12, max=47. At T, min=12 - s(T-t_1), max=47 - s(T-t_1)\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\"\n\nAnd in k=3: (36,25,right,12), so for right, it says [τ,h], so τ=36, h=25? But 36>25, that would be [36,25] which is decreasing, but usually we write intervals with min first.\n\nI think it's better to think in terms of the position.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is between the left and right endpoints, so for a car, at time T, the span is [min_x, max_x], and if 0 is in [min_x, max_x], collision.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, min_x = min(h,τ), max_x = max(h,τ), and since it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn k=1, h=12, τ=47, both positive, min=12, max=47.\n\nAt T, min = min(h,τ) - s(T-t_1), max = max(h,τ) - s(T-t_1)\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: at t_1, min = min(τ,h), max = max(τ,h), and at T, min = min(τ,h) + s(T-t_1), max = max(τ,h) + s(T-t_1)\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left, h is right, but in k=3, (36,25,right,12), so if [τ,h] = [36,25], that would be from 36 to 25, which is backwards, but it should be the interval.\n\nI think it's a bit messy, but in practice, for collision, we need the range of x covered.\n\nSo for each car, I can compute the min and max x at time t_1, then at time T, for left-moving, min_T = min_t1 - s*(T-t_1), max_T = max_t1 - s*(T-t_1)\n\nFor right-moving, min_T = min_t1 + s*(T-t_1), max_T = max_t1 + s*(T-t_1)\n\nThen collision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k and 0 in [min_T, max_T] for some car on k.\n\nAlso, note that the player is on a freeway only when moving vertically, but since we're on the grid, when we are at position (0,y), for y=1 to 8, we are on freeway y.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe collision is with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, player starts at (0,1) at turn t_1=9, which is freeway 1.\n\nWe need to go to (0,9), which is above freeways, so y=9 is safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 at some turn, so we need to be at position (0,9) after some sequence of actions.\n\nEach action changes y or not, and we have to avoid being on a freeway y when there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, from the note: if at turn T, you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are on y_T, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T, not on where you are going.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1)\"\n\nBut since collision is checked at turn T based on y_T, and cars at T, it doesn't matter about T+1 for that turn.\n\nThe point is that at each turn, when you choose an action, you are at a position, and collision is checked for that position at that turn.\n\nIf you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and after action, you go to y_{T+1}, but the collision at T is for y_T.\n\nSimilarly, at T+1, you are on y_{T+1} for collision check.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway at t_1=9.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36)\n\nSince left-moving, min_t1 = min(12,47) = 12, max_t1 = max(12,47) = 47\n\nAt time T, min_T = 12 - 36*(T-9), max_T = 47 - 36*(T-9)\n\nCollision on freeway 1 at T if 0 in [12 - 36*(T-9), 47 - 36*(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (12,47,left,36) so identical to freeway 1.\n\nIs that possible? Different freeways can have same cars, I guess.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving cars, min and max at t1.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) — for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ,h], but what are τ and h? The tuple is (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span definition, for right, it's [τ,h] with τ and h.\n\nI think I need to interpret the tuple as given: for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for this car, τ=36, h=25? But 36 and 25, [36,25] which is invalid if 36>25, so probably τ and h are such that min and max are defined.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define for each car the min and max x at t1.\n\nFor a car, the span is given by head and tail, but for movement, it's the range.\n\nFor collision, we care about the interval containing x from min to max.\n\nSo for any car, at t1, the span [min_x, max_x] is such that all x between min and max are occupied.\n\nFor left-moving, min and max decrease; for right, min and max increase.\n\nIn the tuple, for freeway 3, first car: (36,25,right,12)\n\nSince right-moving, and Span(t1) = [τ,h], so τ=36, h=25, so min_x = min(τ,h) = min(36,25) = 25, max_x = max(τ,h) = max(36,25) = 36\n\nThen at T, min_T = min_x + s*(T-9) = 25 + 12*(T-9), max_T = 36 + 12*(T-9)\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0,-11,right,12), so τ=0, h=-11, min_x = min(0,-11) = -11, max_x = max(0,-11) = 0\n\nAt T, min_T = -11 + 12*(T-9), max_T = 0 + 12*(T-9) = 12*(T-9)\n\nThird car: (-36,-47,right,12), τ=-36, h=-47, min_x = min(-36,-47) = -47, max_x = max(-36,-47) = -36\n\nAt T, min_T = -47 + 12*(T-9), max_T = -36 + 12*(T-9)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) so identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSo for right-moving, τ=-12, h=-23, min_x = min(-12,-23) = -23, max_x = max(-12,-23) = -12\n\nAt T, min_T = -23 + 6*(T-9), max_T = -12 + 6*(T-9)\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-12,-23,right,6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,6), min_x=-23, max_x=-12 at t1\n\nAt T, min_T = -23 +6*(T-9), max_T = -12 +6*(T-9)\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6), so τ=54, h=43, min_x = min(54,43)=43, max_x = max(54,43)=54\n\nAt T, min_T =43 +6*(T-9), max_T=54 +6*(T-9)\n\nNow, since the cars are moving, we need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at each turn.\n\nBut for the player, we care about when we are on a particular y, at turn T, whether it is safe.\n\nSince we start at y=1 at turn 9, and need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 8, since from y=1 to y=9, we need to increase by 8, so at least 8 up moves, but we can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 8 if we detour or wait.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\ny starts at 1, we need to reach 9, so net +8 in y, so with U actions, each U increases y by 1, S and D don't help or decrease, so minimal actions should be all U, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, which would increase H.\n\nSo optimal might be H=8 with all U, but we need to check if it's possible.\n\nFirst, let's see the collision points.\n\nI am considering turns starting from t=0 for simplicity, where t=0 is turn t_1=9.\n\nSo let τ = T - 9, so τ=0 at current time.\n\nThen for each freeway, at time τ (from now), the min and max for cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, min at τ=0: 12, max at τ=0: 47\n\nAt time τ, min_τ = 12 - 36τ, max_τ = 47 - 36τ\n\nCollision if 0 in [12-36τ, 47-36τ]\n\nThat is, 12-36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 47-36τ\n\nFirst inequality: 12-36τ ≤ 0 => 12 ≤ 36τ => τ ≥ 12/36 = 1/3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 47-36τ => 36τ ≤ 47 => τ ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for τ between 1/3 and 47/36, approximately 0.333 to 1.305, so at τ=1, let's check.\n\nτ=1: min=12-36= -24, max=47-36=11, so [ -24, 11], 0 is in it? -24 ≤ 0 ≤ 11, yes, 0≤11 true.\n\nτ=0: min=12, max=47, 12≤0≤47? 0<12, false, not <= since 0<12, so 0 not in [12,47]\n\nτ=2: min=12-72= -60, max=47-72= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision on freeway 1 for τ from ceil(1/3) to floor(47/36), τ=1 only since τ integer? Turns are discrete, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, so τ = T - t_1, integer.\n\nt_1=9, T integer, so τ integer.\n\nτ ≥ 1/3, so τ ≥1 since τ integer, τ ≤ 47/36 ≈1.305, so τ≤1, so τ=1 only.\n\nAt τ=1 (turn T=10), collision on freeway 1 if player is there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so collision only at τ=1.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) but we have min_x=25, max_x=36 at τ=0\n\nAt τ, min_τ=25 +12τ, max_τ=36 +12τ\n\n0 in [25+12τ, 36+12τ] if 25+12τ ≤0 and 0≤36+12τ\n\nBut 25+12τ ≤0 => 12τ ≤ -25, impossible since τ≥0, so never true. So first car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) min_x=-11, max_x=0 at τ=0? Earlier: min_x = min(τ,h) for right, but in tuple (0,-11,right,12), τ=0, h=-11, min_x=min(0,-11)= -11, max_x=max(0,-11)=0\n\nAt τ, min_τ= -11 +12τ, max_τ= 0 +12τ =12τ\n\n0 in [min_τ, max_τ] = [-11+12τ, 12τ]\n\nSo -11+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nFirst: -11+12τ ≤0 => 12τ ≤11 => τ ≤ 11/12 ≈0.916\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 12τ => τ ≥0\n\nSo for τ=0 only, since τ≤0.916 and τ≥0, τ integer, so τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, min=-11, max=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt τ=1, min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at τ=0 for this car.\n\nThird car: (-36,-47,right,12) min_x=-47, max_x=-36 at τ=0\n\nAt τ, min_τ=-47+12τ, max_τ=-36+12τ\n\n0 in [-47+12τ, -36+12τ] if -47+12τ ≤0 and 0≤-36+12τ\n\nFirst: -47+12τ ≤0 => 12τ ≤47 => τ≤47/12≈3.916\n\nSecond: 0≤-36+12τ => 36≤12τ => τ≥3\n\nSo for τ=3,4? τ≥3 and τ≤3.916, so τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt τ=4, min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, collisions at τ=0 (from second car) and τ=3 (from third car).\n\nNow, freeway 4 and 5 same as freeway 3, so same collision times.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-12,-23,right,6) min_x=-23, max_x=-12 at τ=0\n\nAt τ, min_τ= -23 +6τ, max_τ= -12 +6τ\n\n0 in [-23+6τ, -12+6τ] if -23+6τ ≤0 and 0≤-12+6τ\n\nFirst: -23+6τ≤0 => 6τ≤23 => τ≤23/6≈3.833\n\nSecond: 0≤-12+6τ => 12≤6τ => τ≥2\n\nSo τ from 2 to 3.833, integer τ=2,3\n\nAt τ=2: min=-23+12= -11, max=-12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt τ=3: min=-23+18= -5, max=-12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt τ=4: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision at τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 6, collision at τ=2,3.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,6) same as above, min_τ=-23+6τ, max_τ=-12+6τ\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6) min_x=min(54,43)=43, max_x=54 at τ=0\n\nAt τ, min_τ=43+6τ, max_τ=54+6τ\n\n0 in [43+6τ, 54+6τ]? 43+6τ ≤0? Since τ≥0, 43+6τ≥43>0, so 0 not in [43+6τ,54+6τ] ever.\n\nSo only first car matters for freeway 8, which is the same as freeway 6 car, so min_τ=-23+6τ, max_τ=-12+6τ, collision when 0 in that, i.e., τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=2 and τ=3, for the first car, it covers 0.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is unsafe (collision possible) at turn τ:\n\nτ is from current, τ=0,1,2,...\n\nFreeway y=1: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=2: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=0 and τ=3\n\ny=4: same as y=3, unsafe τ=0,3\n\ny=5: same, unsafe τ=0,3\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\nNow, player starts at y=1, τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t_1=9, position (0,1), which is freeway 1.\n\nBut at τ=0, for freeway 1, is it safe?\n\nFrom above, freeway 1 unsafe only at τ=1, not τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, for y=1: min=12, max=47, 0 not in [12,47], so safe.\n\nBut player is at y=1 at τ=0, and freeway 1 is safe at τ=0.\n\nBut for y=3,4,5, unsafe at τ=0.\n\nBut player is not on y=3,4,5 at τ=0.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn from start: let t be the number of turns from now, so at t=0, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t=H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nActions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have moved to y_{t_1 + H -1}, I think.\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\nAt turn T, we apply action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position is given for turn t_1: (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,1)\n\nThen after action a_{t_1}, we get y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions at time t for t=0 to H-1, yielding positions at time t+1 or something.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time T (absolute), position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThe position is for turn T: (0, y_T)\n\nIn the problem: \"current turn is t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\"\n\nThen \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t} at time t_1 + t, we get y_{t_1 + t + 1}\n\nSo after H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? But the position is reached after the actions.\n\nAt time t_1, we are at y_{t_1} =1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at time t_1, we move to y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at time t_1 +1, we are at y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at time t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want for some k, y_{t_1 + k} =9.\n\nWith k from 0 to ... but at k=0, y_{t_1} =1, not 9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe number of turns H is the number of actions to reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nMinimal H such that we can achieve y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince y starts at 1, ends at 9, net change +8, each U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0, so minimal H is 8 with all U.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nNow, the time: at turn T = t_1 + τ, with τ =0,1,2,... from start.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and we need that if y_T between 1 and 8, it is safe at that T, i.e., for freeway y_T, no car covering x=0 at turn T.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, from above, unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe at τ=1 (T= t_1 +1)\n\ny=2: unsafe at τ=1 (T= t_1 +1)\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=0 and τ=3\n\nBut τ=0 is now, T=t_1, but at τ=0, player is at y=1, not y=3, so for y=3, unsafe at τ=0 and τ=3, meaning turns t_1 and t_1+3.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: unsafe at τ=0,3\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=0,3\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=1, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal path: go up directly.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, safe.\n\nAction: we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U at τ=0 (turn t_1), then y_{t_1 +1} = y_1 +1 =2? Turn: at time T=t_1, action a_{t_1}, sets y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nSo after action at T=t_1, we go to y at T=t_1 +1.\n\nPosition at time T is before action or after? I think position is defined at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T), then we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is (0, y_{T+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nSo for turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, must be safe for that T.\n\nAt T=t_1, y=1, which is safe, as above.\n\nWe choose action to move to next y.\n\nWe want after H actions, at time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nNow, let's try to go up directly.\n\nStart: τ=0, T=t_1=9, y=1, safe.\n\nAction: U, so y_{10} =2\n\nNow at τ=1, T=10, y=2\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at τ=1, as per above.\n\nAt τ=1, T=10, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe because at τ=1, y=2 has collision.\n\nFrom above, y=2 unsafe at τ=1.\n\nSo if we go to y=2 at T=10 (τ=1), it is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at τ=0 to go to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nIf we do S at τ=0, stay at y=1, but at τ=0, y=1 is safe, but if we stay, at next turn τ=1, T=11? Let's see.\n\nAt T=9 (τ=0), y=1, safe.\n\nIf we do S, then y_{10} = y_9 +0 =1, so at T=10 (τ=1), y=1\n\nBut y=1 is unsafe at τ=1, so at T=10, y=1, collision.\n\nIf we do D, y_{10} =1-1=0, which is y=0, not a freeway, safe, but we go down.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSo at τ=0, we cannot go to y=2 at τ=1 because unsafe, and if we stay or down, at τ=1 we might be at y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut y=1 at τ=1 is unsafe, so we must not be at y=1 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at τ=1 unsafe.\n\nSo at τ=1, freeways 1 and 2 are both unsafe.\n\nNow, what about other y at τ=1?\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=0 and τ=3, not τ=1, so at τ=1, y=3 might be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5: unsafe only at τ=0,3, so at τ=1 safe.\n\ny=6,7,8: unsafe at τ=2,3, so at τ=1 safe.\n\nAt τ=1, only y=1 and y=2 unsafe, others safe.\n\nBut we start at y=1, τ=0.\n\nTo be safe at τ=1, we need to be at y=3,4,5,6,7,8 or 0 or 9.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=1.\n\nIf we do U, we go to y=2 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S, we stay y=1 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nIf we do D, we go to y=0 at τ=1, which is safe, since no freeway.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo one option is to go down to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 8.\n\nSince at τ=1, we must avoid y=1 and y=2, so we need to be elsewhere.\n\nAt τ=0, from y=1, possible actions:\n\n- U: to y=2 at τ=1, unsafe\n\n- S: to y=1 at τ=1, unsafe\n\n- D: to y=0 at τ=1, safe\n\nSo only safe choice is to go down to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, T=t_1+1=10, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we can choose actions.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAt τ=1, y=0.\n\nAction: we can do U, to y=1 at τ=2? Turn: at T=10, we are at y=0 (position at T=10).\n\nAction a_{10} determines y_{11}.\n\nIf a_{10} = U, then y_{11} = 0 +1 =1\n\nThen at T=11, τ=2, y=1.\n\nBut we need to check if safe.\n\nFirst, at τ=2, which freeways unsafe.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at τ=1, not τ=2? τ=1 is T=t_1+1=10.\n\nAt τ=2, T=11.\n\ny=1: unsafe only at τ=1, so at τ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: unsafe only at τ=1, so at τ=2, safe.\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=0 and τ=3, τ=0 is past, τ=3 is future, so at τ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4,5: safe at τ=2.\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=2 and τ=3\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=2,3\n\nSo at τ=2, unsafe for y=6,7,8.\n\nSafe for y=1,2,3,4,5, and 0,9.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1 is safe.\n\nBack to point: at τ=1, y=0, safe.\n\nIf we do U, to y=1 at τ=2 (T=11).\n\ny=1 at τ=2 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to consider the path.\n\nSince we went down first, we have extra moves.\n\nWe could go directly to other y, but from y=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2 with actions.\n\nAt τ=0, we must go down to y=0 to avoid being at y=1 or 2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0.\n\nNow, we can go up to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=2, we can go to y=2, etc.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, from start:\n\nτ=0: y=1, must do D to go to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nAction at τ=0: D\n\nThen at τ=1: y=0, safe.\n\nNow at τ=1 (T=10), we are at y=0.\n\nAction: we can do U to go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nOr S to stay y=0, or D to y=-1, but y must be >=0, so D not possible? y in [0,9], so at y=0, D would make y=-1, not allowed, so Δy: if action would make y<0 or >9, probably not allowed, or y capped.\n\nFrom the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if it would be out, it might be capped, but to be safe, we should avoid actions that cause out of bound, so at y=0, D not possible, similarly at y=9, U not possible.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U or S.\n\nIf S, stay at y=0.\n\nBut we need to go up, so better to go up.\n\nSo at τ=1, y=0, do U, go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, safe as above.\n\nNow at τ=2, y=1.\n\nWe can do U to go to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, which y are unsafe.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: unsafe only τ=1, not τ=3, safe\n\ny=2: unsafe only τ=1, safe\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=2 and τ=3\n\nAt τ=2, y=6 unsafe, but at τ=3, y=6 unsafe.\n\ny=7: unsafe τ=2,3\n\ny=8: unsafe τ=2,3\n\nSo at τ=3, unsafe for y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSafe for y=1,2,0,9.\n\nAt τ=2, we are at y=1.\n\nIf we do U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\ny=2 at τ=3 is safe, since y=2 unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at τ=3 safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nSo from y=1 at τ=2, do U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\ny=2 at τ=3 safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, we can do U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, what is unsafe.\n\nFirst, τ=4.\n\ny=1: unsafe τ=1 only, safe\n\ny=2: unsafe τ=1 only, safe\n\ny=3: unsafe τ=0 and τ=3, not τ=4, safe\n\ny=4: same, unsafe τ=0,3, safe at τ=4\n\ny=5: same, safe\n\ny=6: unsafe τ=2,3, not τ=4, safe\n\nSimilarly y=7,8: unsafe τ=2,3, safe at τ=4\n\nAll y safe at τ=4 except possibly, but from above, no unsafe at τ=4.\n\nτ=4 is later.\n\nAt τ=4, T=t_1+4=13.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, we want to go to y=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, if we go to y=3 at τ=4? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=3, we are at y=2.\n\nAction: if we do U, then y_{τ=4} =3 at T=t_1+4.\n\nNow, at that time, τ=4, y=3, is it safe? Yes, as above.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut we have wasted some moves.\n\nCurrently, at τ=0: y=1, action D to y=0 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=0, action U to y=1 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=1, action U to y=2 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=2, now we can go U to y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=3, U to y=4 at τ=5\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at τ=3 to y=3 at τ=4, then y=4 at τ=5, y=5 at τ=6, y=6 at τ=7, y=7 at τ=8, y=8 at τ=9, y=9 at τ=10.\n\nBut we need to check if during this, at any turn, when on freeway, it is safe.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=4, y=3: safe, as above.\n\nτ=5, y=4: safe, similarly.\n\nτ=6, y=5: safe.\n\nτ=7, y=6: at τ=7, which is after τ=3, and y=6 unsafe only at τ=2,3, so at τ=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly τ=8, y=7: unsafe at τ=2,3, safe at τ=8.\n\nτ=9, y=8: unsafe at τ=2,3, safe at τ=9.\n\nThen at τ=10, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at τ=10, so H=10 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=1.\n\nAfter first action (τ=0), to y=0 at τ=1\n\nAfter second action (τ=1), to y=1 at τ=2\n\nAfter third action (τ=2), to y=2 at τ=3\n\nAfter fourth action (τ=3), to y=3 at τ=4\n\nAfter fifth, to y=4 at τ=5\n\nAfter sixth, to y=5 at τ=6\n\nAfter seventh, to y=6 at τ=7\n\nAfter eighth, to y=7 at τ=8\n\nAfter ninth, to y=8 at τ=9\n\nAfter tenth, to y=9 at τ=10\n\nSo 10 actions, reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nBut minimal? We could go faster.\n\nSince at τ=1, we are at y=0, instead of going back to y=1, we could go to another y, but from y=0, we can only go to y=1 or stay.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps we can go up later without going down.\n\nBut at the beginning, we had to go down to avoid τ=1 at y=1 or 2.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, we could stay or something, but at τ=0, if we do S, we stay at y=1, but at next turn τ=1, y=1 is unsafe, so we cannot stay.\n\nOnly down is possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=3 directly, but from y=1, we can only move to adjacent y, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo we must go through the y levels step by step.\n\nSo the path must consist of moving one y at a time.\n\nTherefore, to go from y=1 to y=9, we need at least 8 up moves, and possibly some down or stay, which increase H.\n\nIn this case, we have one down and then up, so net we have one extra down and one extra up, so H=10 instead of 8.\n\nBut we might avoid the down by waiting or something.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, if we could stay at y=1 for multiple turns, but at τ=1, y=1 is unsafe, so we cannot be at y=1 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at y=2 at τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=1, and we must leave to y=0 since other moves are unsafe.\n\nUnless we go up to y=2 at τ=1, but unsafe.\n\nSo no choice, must go down at first.\n\nBut let's confirm if at τ=1, y=1 is indeed unsafe.\n\nAt τ=1, T=10.\n\nFor freeway 1: at τ=1, min=12-36(1)= -24, max=47-36=11, so [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same.\n\nSo yes, unsafe.\n\nNow, after going down, we came back to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, T=11, y=1.\n\nFreeway 1: at τ=2, min=12-36(2)=12-72=-60, max=47-72=-25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, from y=1 at τ=2, we can go to y=2 at τ=3.\n\ny=2 at τ=3: freeway 2, at τ=3, min=12-36*3=12-108=-96, max=47-108=-61, [-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=3: freeway 3.\n\nNow, freeway 3 unsafe at τ=0 and τ=3, not τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, T=13.\n\nFreeway 3 cars: first car min_τ=25+12τ, at τ=4, min=25+48=73, max=36+48=84, [73,84], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: min_τ=-11+12τ, at τ=4, -11+48=37, max=12*4=48, [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: min_τ=-47+12τ, at τ=4, -47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in? 0 not in [1,12] since 0<1.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other y.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have H=10.\n\nBut we can reach faster by not going back to y=1 but going directly to higher y.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at τ=1, we go to y=1 at τ=2, but we could go to y=1 and then immediately to y=2 at τ=3, which we did.\n\nBut at τ=3, we are at y=2, and we can go to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at τ=4.\n\nNotice that at τ=3, y=3,4,5,6,7,8 are all unsafe, so we cannot be on those at τ=3.\n\nIn our sequence, we are at y=2 at τ=3, which is safe, and we go to y=3 at τ=4, safe.\n\nBut we could go up faster if possible.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at τ=3, if we could go to y=3 at τ=4, but we have to, since one step.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by going up during safe times.\n\nAnother point: at τ=2, when we are at y=1, instead of going to y=2, we could go to y=2 at τ=3, but we did.\n\nτ=2 we are at y=1, action to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=2, we could do nothing else.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some levels by waiting, but no, we must move step by step.\n\nMinimal H is 8, but we need 2 extra moves: down and up, so H=10.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by τ=9 or something.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1, action D to y=0 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, y=0, action U to y=1 at τ=2\n\nNow at τ=2, y=1, we could do U to y=2 at τ=3\n\nBut at τ=3, y=2 is safe.\n\nThen from y=2 at τ=3, we do U to y=3 at τ=4\n\ny=3 at τ=4 safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=5\n\nU to y=5 at τ=6\n\nU to y=6 at τ=7\n\nBut at τ=7, y=6: freeway 6 unsafe at τ=2,3, not τ=7, so safe.\n\nSimilarly U to y=7 at τ=8\n\nU to y=8 at τ=9\n\nU to y=9 at τ=10\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=3, we are at y=2, and we need to go to y=9, which is 7 steps up, so from τ=3 to τ=10, 7 actions to go from y=2 to y=9, but we start from action at τ=3 to reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nTotal actions: from τ=0 to τ=9? Let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTime: turn T, relative τ, position y_τ\n\nτ=0: T=9, y=1\n\nAction a_{t1} = a9, let's use absolute or relative.\n\nSet t_1=9.\n\nTurn 9 (τ=0): position y=1, choose action a9.\n\nIf a9=D, then y10 = 0\n\nTurn 10 (τ=1): position y=0, choose action a10.\n\nIf a10=U, then y11=1\n\nTurn 11 (τ=2): position y=1, choose action a11.\n\nIf a11=U, then y12=2\n\nTurn 12 (τ=3): position y=2, choose action a12.\n\nIf a12=U, then y13=3\n\nTurn 13 (τ=4): y=3, a13=U, y14=4\n\nTurn 14 (τ=5): y=4, a14=U, y15=5\n\nTurn 15 (τ=6): y=5, a15=U, y16=6\n\nTurn 16 (τ=7): y=6, a16=U, y17=7\n\nTurn 17 (τ=8): y=7, a17=U, y18=8\n\nTurn 18 (τ=9): y=8, a18=U, y19=9\n\nTurn 19 (τ=10): position y=9, done.\n\nSo actions from turn 9 to turn 18, that's 10 actions: a9 to a18.\n\nH=10.\n\nReach at turn 19.\n\nBut perhaps we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, we are at y=0, we go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, we go to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=2, we are at y=1, which is safe, but we could go directly to y=2 if possible, but we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=3, instead of being at y=2, we could be at a higher y, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster by using down moves to avoid unsafe times, but down moves would make us go away, so probably slower.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, if we are at y=2, we go to y=3 at τ=4, but at τ=3, y=3 is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nBut to reach y=3, we have to be there at some turn.\n\nIn this case, we are at y=3 at τ=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach with fewer than 10 actions.\n\nMinimal is 8, but impossible because at τ=1, we must not be at y=1 or 2, and since we start at y=1 τ=0, the only way is to go down to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen from y=0, we must go to y=1 at some point, but at τ=1, we are at y=0, and if we go to y=1 at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=1 is τ=2, then we need to go to y=9, which takes at least 8 more actions? From y=1 to y=9, 8 steps up.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=2, after 8 actions, we reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nActions: at τ=2, from y=1, after first U, y=2 at τ=3; second U, y=3 at τ=4; ... after eighth U, y=9 at τ=10.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we could reach a higher y earlier, but we can't because we have to go through y=0 first.\n\nAt τ=1, we are at y=0, we could stay there, but that would delay, worse.\n\nSo H=10 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times again to see if there is a shortcut.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=6,7,8 are unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3 to 8 unsafe.\n\nBut in our path, we are at y=2 at τ=3, safe.\n\nNow, after that, all safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go from y=2 directly to y=9 in 7 moves, but no, step by step.\n\nAnother thought: since at τ=4 onwards, all y are safe, as no more unsafe times listed, so from τ=4, we can go up freely.\n\nIn our sequence, we start going up from τ=4 with y=3.\n\nBut we reached y=3 at τ=4.\n\nIf we can reach a higher y by τ=4, we could save time.\n\nBut at τ=0, y=1, we go down to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nSo y=3 at τ=4 is the earliest we can be at y=3.\n\nSimilarly, we need 5 more ups to y=8, then to y=9.\n\ny=3 to y=9 is 6 steps: to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt τ=4 y=3, after 6 actions: to y=4 at τ=5, y=5 τ=6, ..., y=9 at τ=9? Let's see:\n\nAt τ=4, y=3\n\nAction U, y=4 at τ=5\n\nU, y=5 at τ=6\n\nU, y=6 at τ=7\n\nU, y=7 at τ=8\n\nU, y=8 at τ=9\n\nU, y=9 at τ=10\n\nSame as before, y=9 at τ=10.\n\nFrom y=2 at τ=3 to y=9: y=2 to y=3 at τ=4, etc., up to y=9 at τ=10.\n\nStill.\n\nAt τ=3, we are at y=2, which is safe, and we could go to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=4 is safe.\n\nIf we could go to y=4 at τ=4, but from y=2, we can only go to y=1,2,3.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the initial down by going to another y.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, if we do U, we go to y=2 at τ=1, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=1 for τ=0, but then at τ=1 we must not be there, so we have to move.\n\nNo, at τ=0 we can choose to move.\n\nI think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have one down and nine ups? From y=1 down to y=0, then up to y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, so actions: one D, and then nine U? From y=0 to y=9, that's 9 U, but we started from y=1 down to y=0, then up.\n\nNet: from y=1 to y=0 to y=9, so one down and nine up, but since we end at y=9, the net change is +8, so number of U minus number of D should be 8.\n\nIn this case, we have one D and multiple U.\n\nLet's count: actions: a9=D (down), a10=U (up to y=1), a11=U (to y=2), a12=U (y=3), ..., up to a18=U (to y=9).\n\na9 to a18 is 10 actions: one D and nine U.\n\nNet y change: -1 +9 = +8, from 1 to 9, yes.\n\nNumber of U: 9, number of D:1, S:0.\n\nMinimal U is 8, but here we have 9 U because of the down.\n\nBut we cannot avoid the down, so H=10.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by going down less or something.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=1, when we are at y=0, instead of going up immediately, we stay, but that delays.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, we can go to y=1 later, but since we need to go up, better to go as soon as safe.\n\nAt τ=2, we go to y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut at τ=3, when we go to y=2, safe.\n\nNow, we cannot go to y=3 at τ=3 because y=3 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nSo we must wait until τ=4 to be at y=3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think H=10 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=9.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nThen position at turn 10: y=0\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nPosition at turn 11: y=1\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nPosition at turn 12: y=2\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nPosition at turn 13: y=3\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nPosition at turn 14: y=4\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nPosition at turn 15: y=5\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nPosition at turn 16: y=6\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nPosition at turn 17: y=7\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nPosition at turn 18: y=8\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nPosition at turn 19: y=9\n\nReached at turn 19 with 10 actions.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we have collision.\n\nFor example, at turn 10 (τ=1), y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nTurn 11 (τ=2), y=1, freeway 1: at τ=2, min=-60, max=-25, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 12 (τ=3), y=2, freeway 2: at τ=3, min=12-108=-96, max=47-108=-61, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 13 (τ=4), y=3, freeway 3: at τ=4, as before, min and max for cars: first car [73,84], second [37,48], third [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 14 (τ=5), y=4, freeway 4 same as 3, at τ=5: min for cars: first min=25+12*5=25+60=85, max=36+60=96; second min=-11+60=49, max=0+60=60? max_τ for second car was 12τ, at τ=5, min=-11+60=49, max=60, [49,60]; third min=-47+60=13, max=-36+60=24, [13,24]; all >0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 15 (τ=6), y=5, similar.\n\nTurn 16 (τ=7), y=6, freeway 6: at τ=7, car min_τ=-23+6*7=-23+42=19, max_τ=-12+42=30, [19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 17 (τ=8), y=7, freeway 7 same as 6, at τ=8, min=-23+48=25, max=-12+48=36, [25,36], safe.\n\nTurn 18 (τ=9), y=8, freeway 8: first car min_τ=-23+6*9=-23+54=31, max=-12+54=42; second car min=43+54=97, max=54+54=108; so [31,42] and [97,108], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen turn 19, y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose we start at τ=0 y=1.\n\nIf we do D to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1 y=0, instead of U to y=1, we do nothing, but if S, stay y=0, then at τ=2 y=0.\n\nThen we need to go to y=1 at τ=3 or something, but later.\n\nFor example, at τ=1 y=0, do S, stay y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, do U to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1, which is safe? y=1 unsafe only τ=1, at τ=3 safe.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=3, we can go U to y=2 at τ=4, etc.\n\nBut now we reached y=1 at τ=3, later than before, so to go to y=9 will take longer.\n\nFor example, y=1 at τ=3, then to y=2 τ=4, y=3 τ=5, ..., y=9 at τ=11, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nAt τ=1 y=0, do U to y=1 at τ=2, as before.\n\nThen at τ=2 y=1, we could do S to stay at y=1 for τ=3, but y=1 at τ=3 is safe, but staying doesn't help, we need to go up.\n\nThen at τ=3, do U to y=2 at τ=4, etc., same as before but with a stay, which adds a turn, so H larger.\n\nThus, the sequence with D at start and then all U is minimal H=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, after D, we have U from y=0 to y=1, then U to y=2, etc.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 directly from y=2 at τ=3 to τ=4, but we do.\n\nI think H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 (9): D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 12 to 18, all U to go up.\n\nIn terms of the actions.\n\nSince t_1=9, actions from turn 9 to turn 18.\n\nH=10.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 8 has two cars, but we checked it was fine.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 3,4,5, at τ=0, there was a car at (0,-11,right,12) which at τ=0 has min=-11, max=0, so covers x=0, but at τ=0, player is at y=1, not y=3, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is required. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10.\n\nThe sequence begins with a down move (D) to avoid the unsafe condition on freeways 1 and 2 at turn 10 (relative turn \\(\\tau = 1\\)). After moving to \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as it is not a freeway), the player moves up (U) repeatedly to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, ensuring that all positions on freeways are safe at the respective turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 9 (current turn, \\(\\tau = 0\\))**: Action D to move to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 10. (Safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars.)\n- **Turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 1\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 11. (At turn 11, \\(y = 1\\) is safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\).)\n- **Turn 11 (\\(\\tau = 2\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 12. (At turn 12, \\(y = 2\\) is safe, as freeway 2 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\).)\n- **Turn 12 (\\(\\tau = 3\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 13. (At turn 13, \\(y = 3\\) is safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\), not at \\(\\tau = 4\\).)\n- **Turn 13 (\\(\\tau = 4\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14. (At turn 14, \\(y = 4\\) is safe, as freeway 4 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\).)\n- **Turn 14 (\\(\\tau = 5\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 15. (At turn 15, \\(y = 5\\) is safe, as freeway 5 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\).)\n- **Turn 15 (\\(\\tau = 6\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16. (At turn 16, \\(y = 6\\) is safe, as freeway 6 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\).)\n- **Turn 16 (\\(\\tau = 7\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17. (At turn 17, \\(y = 7\\) is safe, as freeway 7 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\).)\n- **Turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 8\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18. (At turn 18, \\(y = 8\\) is safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\).)\n- **Turn 18 (\\(\\tau = 9\\))**: Action U to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. (At turn 19, \\(y = 9\\) is safe, as it is not a freeway.)\n\nAfter 10 actions, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. This sequence minimizes \\(H\\) because:\n- At \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 10), freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe, requiring the initial down move to \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision.\n- Moving up immediately from \\(y = 0\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\) to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\) allows progression during safe periods.\n- All subsequent up moves occur when the target freeways are safe, and no shorter path exists due to the constraints of the car movements and the need to avoid unsafe turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each action U, D, or S changes the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move according to their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left over time, and for right-moving, it shifts right. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn.\n\nImportantly, if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you decide action a_T which determines y_{T+1}. But for collision, at turn T, it's based on y_T and the car spans on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe car state is given for turn t_1=10. I need to find the sequence of actions from t=10 onwards to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, list all the cars and their positions at t=10.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, left-moving, head at -24, tail at 11, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, at time T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] but head and tail: for left-moving, head is at the left, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe notation: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Similarly for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, head is the left end, tail is the right end? But typically for left-moving, the head is the front, which is left if moving left. Similarly for right.\n\nLet's clarify the span.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ] meaning from h to τ, with h < τ since it's left-moving, so h is left end, τ is right end? No.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ are positions, and s is speed, moving left, decreasing x.\n\nBut in the span, [h, τ], if h and τ are numbers, and for left-moving, let's assume h is the leftmost point, τ is the rightmost? But in the example, for freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36), so h=-24, τ=11, so since left-moving, at t_1, the car spans from x=-24 to x=11? But that would be a length of 35 units, and speed 36, which seems odd, but possible.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway we're on.\n\nAlso, note that for multiple cars on a freeway, we need to avoid if any car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, and we need to go to y=9. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but the freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, so no cars there, so we don't have to worry about collisions at y=0 or y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8\". And collision occurs only if on freeway y_T and 0 in span for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no freeway, so no collision possible. We can be there safely.\n\nBut we start at (0,0), which is y=0, and end at (0,9), y=9.\n\nNow, to move from y=0 to y=9, we need to pass through y=1 to y=8 at some points, and avoid being there when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince we move one y-level per turn, and we can only change by -1,0,+1 per turn, so to go from 0 to 9, minimal steps would be 9 turns if we always go up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should go up as fast as possible unless blocked.\n\nNow, let's list the car positions for each freeway at t=10, and then for future turns.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: y=1, one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36, direction left.\n\nAt turn T, span is [h - s(T-10), τ - s(T-10)] = [-24 - 36(T-10), 11 - 36(T-10)]\n\nCollision at y=1 if 0 is in this interval for some T when we are at y=1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is shifting left over time.\n\n0 is in the span when min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nFor left-moving, at time T, left end L(T) = -24 -36(T-10), right end R(T) = 11 -36(T-10)\n\n0 in [L(T), R(T)] if L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nSince L(T) < R(T) always, as the car has length.\n\nLength: from -24 to 11 is 35 units, speed 36 per turn? Speed s=36, but per what? Turns, I assume, since T is in turns.\n\ns is in units per turn, I think.\n\nSo L(T) <= 0 <= R(T) when:\n\n-24 -36(T-10) <= 0 and 0 <= 11 -36(T-10)\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36ΔT <= 0 where ΔT = T-10\n\n-36ΔT <= 24\n\nDivide by -36, inequality flips: ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3, but ΔT >=0 since T>=10, so always true? Let's see:\n\n-24 -36ΔT <= 0\n\n-36ΔT <= 24\n\nNow, divide by -36, so ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3, but since ΔT >=0, this is always true for T>=10.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36ΔT\n\n36ΔT <= 11\n\nΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo 0 <= R(T) only when ΔT <= 11/36, which is less than 1, so for T=10, ΔT=0, R(10)=11>0, so 0 <=11 true.\n\nAt T=10, L(10)= -24, R(10)=11, so -24 <=0<=11, yes, 0 is in span.\n\nBut at turn T=10, we are at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision at T=10 for us.\n\nFor future turns, 0 in span only if ΔT <= 11/36, so only for T=10, since ΔT=0 <=0.305, T=11, ΔT=1>0.305? 11/36≈0.305, so ΔT=0: T=10, ΔT=1: T=11, 1>0.305, so R(T)=11-36*1=11-36=-25<0, so 0 <= -25 false, and L(T)= -24-36= -60<0, so 0 not in [ -60, -25] since -25<0.\n\nSimilarly for T>10, R(T) decreases, L(T) decreases, both less than 0, so 0 not in span for T>10.\n\nAt T=10, it is in span, but we are not on y=1 at T=10.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at all turns T>=10, since T>10, 0 is not in the car span, so y=1 is always safe to be on for T>10? At T=10, it is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nFor T=11, L(11)= -24 -36(1) = -60, R(11)=11-36= -25, span [-60,-25], 0 not in it.\n\nSimilarly for later turns.\n\nSo freeway 1 is safe at all turns after t_1=10, meaning we can be on y=1 at any turn T>=11 without collision.\n\nT>=11.\n\nBut since we start at T=10, y=0, we might go to y=1 at T=11 if we take action U at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, we are at y=0.\n\nAfter action, at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nSo at turn T=10, y=0.\n\nWe take action a_10, which determines y_11.\n\nThen at turn T=11, we are at y_11, and so on.\n\nFor freeway 1, at turn T, collision if y_T=1 and 0 in car span at T.\n\nBut as above, for T=10, 0 in span, but y_T=1 only if we are there, but at T=10 we are at y=0.\n\nFor T=11, span at T=11 is [-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for T>11, even worse, so y=1 is always safe for T>=11.\n\nNow, similarly for freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Car state: freeway 2: (-24,11,left,36), identical to freeway 1.\n\nSo same thing, y=2 is always safe for T>=11.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars, all right-moving.\n\n(48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so for each car:\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), but span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], since right-moving, τ is left end, h is right end? Notation: \"for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nAnd at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, head and tail: in the tuple, it's (head, tail, ...), but for right-moving, head might be the front, which is right, so in (head, tail), head is larger, tail is smaller.\n\nIn the car state: (48,37,right,12), so head=48, tail=37, direction right, so since moving right, at t_1, span from τ=37 to h=48, so [37,48].\n\nThen at T, [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, so span at t_1: [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +12ΔT, 12 +12ΔT]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, so span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\nNow, for freeway 3, collision at turn T if y_T=3 and 0 in any of the three spans.\n\nSo for each car, when is 0 in its span.\n\nFirst car: [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT], 0 in this interval only if 37+12ΔT <=0 and 0<=48+12ΔT, but 37+12ΔT >=37>0 for ΔT>=0, so min is 37+12ΔT >0, so 0 never in this span. Similarly, max is larger, but min is positive, so 0 not in [positive, larger positive].\n\nSimilarly, third car: [-35+12ΔT, -24+12ΔT], min and max both negative for small ΔT, since at ΔT=0, [-35,-24], both negative. When ΔT large, it becomes positive.\n\n0 in span if -35+12ΔT <=0 <= -24+12ΔT\n\nFirst, -35+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=35/12≈2.916\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24+12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo for ΔT between 2 and 2.916, i.e., T=12 and T=13? ΔT=2: T=12, ΔT=3: T=13\n\nAt ΔT=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 <=0 is true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt ΔT=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included? 0 <=0 is true, so yes, 0 is in [ -11,0].\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=2.916, but since discrete, only at ΔT=2, T=12.\n\nΔT=2: T=12, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo third car has 0 in span only at T=12.\n\nNow second car: [1+12ΔT, 12+12ΔT]\n\nMin is 1+12ΔT >=1>0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nFirst car: always min>37>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the third car causes a problem at T=12, where 0 is in span.\n\nAt other times, no issue.\n\nSpecifically, at T=12, if we are on y=3, collision possible due to third car.\n\nAt other turns, safe.\n\nT=12 is the only unsafe turn for y=3.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? Car state: freeway 4: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) identical to freeway 3.\n\nSo same as above, only unsafe at T=12 when on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same cars, (48,37,right,12), etc., so y=5 unsafe only at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so at t_1, span [τ,h] = [-17,-6]? Tuple is (head, tail) = (-6,-17), direction right.\n\nSo head=-6, tail=-17, since right-moving, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-17,-6]\n\nAt T: [-17 +6ΔT, -6 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span when -17+6ΔT <=0 <= -6+6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -17+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=17 => ΔT <=17/6≈2.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6+6ΔT => 6ΔT >=6 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT from 1 to 2.833, i.e., T=11,12,13? ΔT=1: T=11, ΔT=2: T=12, ΔT=3: T=13 but 17/6≈2.833, so ΔT=3>2.833? Let's see.\n\nAt ΔT=1: -17+6= -11, -6+6=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=2: -17+12= -5, -6+12=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=3: -17+18=1, -6+18=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=11,12, 0 in span for freeway 6.\n\nT=11 and T=12.\n\nFreeway 7: same car, (-6,-17,right,6), so y=7 unsafe at T=11 and T=12.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars, (-6,-17,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nFirst car same as above, unsafe at T=11,12.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6), head=60, tail=49, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT]\n\nMin 49+6ΔT >=49>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car matters, unsafe at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow summarize the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe for T>=11 (as we saw earlier)\n\n- y=2: always safe\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at T=12\n\n- y=4: unsafe only at T=12\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at T=12\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=11 and T=12\n\ny=1 and y=2 are always safe after t_1.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 at T=10 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimal turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might be blocked by unsafe times.\n\nStart at T=10, y=0.\n\nWe take actions starting from a_{t_1} = a_{10}, which affects y_{11}.\n\nLet me denote the turn and the y-position at that turn.\n\nAt T=10: y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we choose a_{10}: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y_{11} =1\n\nIf S, y_{11}=0\n\nIf D, y_{11}= -1? But y must be in [0,9], so D from 0 might not be allowed? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, if a_t=D, Δy=-1, y_{t+1}= -1, but -1 not in [0,9], so probably not allowed. Similarly, from y=9, cannot go U.\n\nSo from y=0, possible actions: U or S, cannot D.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9, can S or D, but since we want to reach it, probably U or S when close.\n\nBut at start, y=0, a_{10} can be U or S.\n\nIf S, stay at y=0, but we need to go up, so probably not useful unless waiting.\n\nSimilarly, at end.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we should go up when possible.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are only for T=11 and T=12 for y=6,7,8, and T=12 for y=3,4,5.\n\ny=1 and y=2 always safe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on unsafe y at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- On y=3,4,5 at T=12: unsafe\n\n- On y=6,7,8 at T=11 or T=12: unsafe\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, since we start at T=10, y=0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, we go U each turn, so at T=11 y=1, T=12 y=2, ..., up to T=19 y=9? Let's see:\n\nT=10: y=0\n\nAfter a_{10}=U, y_{11}=1\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=2\n\na_{12}=U, y_{13}=3\n\n...\n\nContinue: y_{14}=4, y_{15}=5, y_{16}=6, y_{17}=7, y_{18}=8, y_{19}=9\n\nSo at T=19, y=9, H=10 turns? Turns from t=10 to t=19, that's 10 actions? Let's index.\n\nt_1 =10, we need sequence from t=10 to t=10+H-1, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn T, after H-1 actions from t_1.\n\nStart at T=10, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=10), y at t=11.\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=10+k.\n\nWe want y at some turn to be 9.\n\nSet t = t_1 + t, for t=0 to H-1, but actions at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt time T, after actions up to T-1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe position y_{t} is at turn t.\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nFor collision, at turn t, we are at y_t, and if y_t between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 in car span at turn t.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to ensure that for each turn when we are on y=1 to 8, it is not unsafe.\n\nNow, for the minimal path to y=9.\n\nStart: T=10, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are around T=11 and T=12.\n\nIf we go up directly:\n\nT=10: y=0\n\na_{10}=U → y_{11}=1\n\nT=11: y=1, which is freeway 1, but we said y=1 is always safe, so ok.\n\na_{11}=U → y_{12}=2\n\nT=12: y=2, freeway 2, always safe, ok.\n\na_{12}=U → y_{13}=3\n\nT=13: y=3, freeway 3. But freeway 3 is unsafe only at T=12, not at T=13. At T=13, it should be safe.\n\nEarlier for y=3, unsafe only at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 and y=5 unsafe only at T=12.\n\nAt T=13, y=3: should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{13}=U → y_{14}=4\n\nT=14: y=4, freeway 4, unsafe only at T=12, T=14>12, safe.\n\na_{14}=U → y_{15}=5\n\nT=15: y=5, freeway 5, safe since T=15>12.\n\na_{15}=U → y_{16}=6\n\nT=16: y=6, freeway 6. Now freeway 6 unsafe at T=11 and T=12, not at T=16. T=16 is later, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{16}=U → y_{17}=7\n\nT=17: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe only at T=11,12, so safe at T=17.\n\na_{17}=U → y_{18}=8\n\nT=18: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=11,12, safe at T=18.\n\na_{18}=U → y_{19}=9\n\nT=19: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at T=19.\n\nNow, were there any collisions? Let's check each turn when on freeway.\n\nT=11: y=1, safe.\n\nT=12: y=2, safe.\n\nT=13: y=3, safe (since unsafe only T=12)\n\nT=14: y=4, safe\n\nT=15: y=5, safe\n\nT=16: y=6, safe (unsafe at T=11,12, not 16)\n\nT=17: y=7, safe\n\nT=18: y=8, safe\n\nT=19: y=9, safe.\n\nSo no collisions, and we reached in 9 actions: from t=10 to t=18, actions at t=10 to t=18, y at t=19=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=18 inclusive, that's 9 actions? t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: 9 actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAt t_1=10, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at t=10, y at t=11.\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=10 + k.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the notation.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., up to the action that leads to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nIn this case, with actions U from t=10 to t=18, y at t=19=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =19, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nH is the number of turns? \"minimal number of turns H\", but turns might refer to the actions or the time points.\n\nRead: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my sequence, with actions at t=10 to t=18 (9 actions), y_{19}=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =10 + H -1 =19, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut the last action is at t=18, which is t_1 + 8? t_1=10, t=18 is t_1 +8.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t_1 +0} =a_{10}\n\nt=1: a_{11}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} = y after last action.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the text: \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, after actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2, we get to y at t_1 + H -1? Let's think.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAction a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn t_1, y_{t_1} = initial position.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to after a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are already at 9, so the last action to get there is at t_1 + H -2, which sets y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} is after last action.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, if we start at t_1=10, y_{10}=0.\n\nWe want y_{10 + H -1} =9.\n\nAfter actions a_{10} to a_{10 + H -2}, we set y_{10 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is at turn t_1 + H -1, and at that turn, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is 9, and we take an action, but it might be S or something, but since we are at 9, we can take S to stay, or D to go down, but we want to reach, so probably at that turn, we are at 9, and we take an action, but the position is already 9 before the action.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to arrive at turn t_1 + H -1 at position 9.\n\nThe actions to get there are from t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the sequence is given for actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, including the action at the turn when we are at 9.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn T, y_T=9, then at turn T, we take some action, but since we have reached, we might take S to stay, but it's not necessary for reaching, but the sequence must be provided.\n\nIn the minimal H, we might not need to stay.\n\nIn my earlier plan, with direct up, we have y_{19}=9, so at turn 19, we are at 9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =19, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=10 + 10 -1 = t=19? t from 0 to 9, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 9, so a_{10} to a_{19}.\n\nBut at t=19, we take action, but y_{20} might be set, but we are already at y_{19}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach, but since at turn t_1 + H -1 we are at 9, we can take any action, but to minimize H, we should reach as soon as possible, so H is the number until we are at 9.\n\nIn this case, with direct path, we can be at y=9 at T=19 with 9 up actions from T=10 to T=18.\n\nActions at T=10 to T=18: 9 actions, y at T=19=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =19, 10 + H -1=19, H=10.\n\nBut H=10, actions from t=10 to t=19? Inconsistency.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=10, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe action sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} = {a_{10+t}}_{t=0}^{9}, so t=0: a_{10}, t=1: a_{11}, ..., t=9: a_{19}.\n\nBut at turn t=19, we take action a_{19}, which determines y_{20}, but we are at y_{19}=9 already.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to be at 9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor that, the last action to arrive is at turn t_1 + H -2, setting y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we take a_{t_1 + H -1}, which could be S, for example, but it doesn't change position, or U/D, but since at 9, U might not be allowed, so probably S or D.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to include it.\n\nIn terms of reaching, the minimal H is determined by when we first reach y=9.\n\nIn the direct path, we reach at T=19 with 9 actions from T=10 to T=18.\n\nThen at T=19, we need to take an action, but since we have reached, we can take S, for example.\n\nH=10, actions at t=10 to t=19.\n\nBut y_{19} is set by a_{18}, so at t=19, y_{19}=9, then a_{19} is taken, but it doesn't affect reaching.\n\nFor minimal H, we want the smallest H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith direct path, t_1 + H -1=19, H=10.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nStart at T=10, y=0.\n\nIf we could go faster, but we can only increase y by 1 per turn, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 steps, so earliest at T=19.\n\nT=10:0, T=11:1, ..., T=19:9. Yes, 9 turns later, at T=19.\n\nSo minimal possible H is 10, since we need to be at 9 at some turn, earliest T=19.\n\nt_1 + H -1 >=19, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 >=19, H-1>=9, H>=10.\n\nAnd with direct path, we can achieve it without collisions, as I checked.\n\nBut is that true? In my earlier check, I thought it was safe, but let's double-check the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=13, y=3: freeway 3 unsafe only at T=12, so at T=13 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=16 y=6: unsafe only at T=11 and T=12, T=16 safe.\n\nBut in the direct path, we are at y=3 at T=13, which is after T=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut is there any point where we are at unsafe time?\n\nT=11: y=1, safe\n\nT=12: y=2, safe\n\nT=13: y=3, safe\n\n...\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions for y=3 at T=13.\n\nFreeway 3, at T=13, ΔT=T-10=3.\n\nCars:\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span [37+12*3, 48+12*3] = [37+36,48+36]=[73,84]\n\nSecond: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48]\n\nThird: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12]\n\nAll spans positive, 0 not in any, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, for y=2, freeway 2, which has car, but at T=12, freeway 2 car: left-moving, at T=12, ΔT=2, L= -24 -36*2= -24-72= -96, R=11-72= -61, span [-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, for y=6 at T=16: freeway 6, car right-moving, at T=16, ΔT=6, span [-17+6*6, -6+6*6] = [-17+36, -6+36]=[19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo direct path works with H=10.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=10, actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, we are already at y=9, so we need to take an action, which could be S to stay, or since we are at 9, we can take S.\n\nBut in the action, we can take U, but from y=9, U would go to 10, but y=10 not allowed, so probably not allowed, or y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=9, cannot take U, similarly from y=0 cannot take D.\n\nSo at y=9, possible actions S or D.\n\nBut since we want to reach and stop, but the sequence must be provided until the turn we reach, but we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, and we take action there.\n\nTo be safe, we can take S at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, for t=10 to t=18, we take U, then at t=19, since y=9, take S.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=10 to t=19 for H=10.\n\nt=10 to t=19 inclusive, 10 actions.\n\na_{10} to a_{19}.\n\na_{10} to a_{18}: U, each to go up.\n\na_{19}: S, to stay at 9.\n\nBut we reached at t=19, so y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{19} =9, good.\n\nNow, but is there a way to reach earlier? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at T=19 with fewer actions, but no, 9 steps needed.\n\nH=10 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeways 3,4,5, they are unsafe at T=12, but in our path, we are not there at T=12, we are at y=2 at T=12, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6,7,8 unsafe at T=11,12, but we are at y=6 at T=16, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut let's see if we can go faster or something, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps if we go down or wait, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0), and we need to reach (0,9), and in this path, we do.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is another car (60,49,right,6), but it doesn't affect since 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the direct path is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U? t_1=10.\n\na_{10} = U\n\nThen y_{11}=1\n\na_{11} = U, y_{12}=2\n\na_{12} = U, y_{13}=3\n\na_{13} = U, y_{14}=4\n\na_{14} = U, y_{15}=5\n\na_{15} = U, y_{16}=6\n\na_{16} = U, y_{17}=7\n\na_{17} = U, y_{18}=8\n\na_{18} = U, y_{19}=9\n\nNow at turn t=19, y=9, we need to take action a_{19}.\n\nSince y=9, we can take S or D.\n\nBut to stay, we take S.\n\nThen y_{20}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=10, actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\na_{10} to a_{18}: U, a_{19}: S.\n\nBut we reached at turn 19, so for the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a_{19} not specified, but we need to include it.\n\nIn the answer, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut in this case, with a_{19}=S, it works.\n\nSince we are at 9, and we reached, but the action is required.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=10, we take action, but we start at t=10, position given.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, all actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\nNow, but let's confirm if at any point we are on unsafe position.\n\nFor example, at T=12, y=2: freeway 2, car at T=12, as above, span [-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt T=11, y=1: freeway 1, at T=11, ΔT=1, span [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=3 is unsafe at T=12, but we are not there at T=12, we are at T=13.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can save a turn by going down or something, but no, since we need to go up 9 times.\n\nUnless we start from y=0, but we are at 0.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be at y=9 earlier if we do something else, but impossible.\n\nFor example, if we take U at t=10, y=1 at t=11, etc., as above.\n\nIf we take S at t=10, stay at 0, then later go up, but that would delay, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go down from 0.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, they are unsafe at T=11 and T=12.\n\nIn our path, we pass y=6 at T=16, which is fine.\n\nBut suppose we want to go faster, we can't.\n\nPerhaps if we go up but skip some levels by waiting, but that increases time.\n\nFor example, if at some point we need to avoid being at certain y at certain time, but in this case, no conflict.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times again.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=11 and T=12.\n\ny=7 same.\n\ny=8 same.\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe only at T=12.\n\nIn the direct path, we avoid all by being later.\n\nBut at T=12, where are we? y=2, which is safe.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 before T=19? No.\n\nPerhaps we can be at higher y earlier by moving faster, but we can't, only +1 per turn max.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut let's check if at T=12, for example, if we were on y=3, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn our sequence, fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but we are later.\n\nAnother thing: the player update, when we move, we are not on the new y until next turn.\n\nBut in collision, it's clear.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, at T=10, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen at Turn 19: we need action, since y=9, we take S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=10, we have actions up to turn 19.\n\nNow, at turn 19, after taking S, y_{20}=9, but we are already at y_{19}=9.\n\nIn terms of reaching, it is reached at turn 19.\n\nPerhaps we don't need the last action, but the problem requires the sequence until we reach.\n\nIn the answer format, it should include actions until the turn we are at 9.\n\nBut in the box, we write the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, but in this case, with a_{19}=S, it works.\n\nSince at y=9, D is possible, but going down to 8 would not be reaching, so we should take S.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose we go up faster, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at an earlier turn by not starting from t=10 immediately, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for one turn, then go up, we reach at T=20, worse.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nt_1=10, we want y_{10 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=10, y_{19}=9.\n\nActions: a_{10} to a_{19}, 10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{10} to a_{19} as above.\n\nBut in the answer, we write for each turn.\n\nPerhaps we can have y=9 at turn 19 with only 9 actions, but we need to include the action at turn 19.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nAnother point: in the car state for freeway 3,4,5, there are multiple cars, but only one was unsafe at T=12.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the second car, but it doesn't affect.\n\nSo I think the sequence is correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=10.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the last S by reaching earlier, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at turn 18.\n\nBut from y=0 at turn 10, to y=9 at turn 18, we need to increase y by 9 in 8 turns, but each turn max +1, so impossible. Min 9 turns to increase, so from turn 10 to turn 19.\n\nTurn 10: y=0, after 9 up moves, turn 19: y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 19, we take S.\n\nBut since we reached, it could be anything, but S is fine.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to take action after reaching, but the sequence must be provided.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, they are unsafe at T=11 and T=12, but we are not there at those times.\n\nBut suppose we want to go through y=6 at a different time, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down or stay, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to wait to avoid.\n\nFor example, if we were to be on y=3 at T=12, we need to avoid, but in our path, we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the box, it should be written as specified.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at turn 19, which is t_1 + H -1 =10 +10 -1=19, yes.\n\nSince y_{19}=9, and we take S at turn 19.\n\nTo save an action, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 19 and not take further action, but the sequence must include until we reach.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 10. This is achieved by moving up (U) for the first 9 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19, and then staying (S) at turn 19 since the position is already reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n- At turns 11 and 12, the player is on \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\), respectively, which are always safe for \\(T \\geq 11\\).\n- At turns 13 to 15, the player is on \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 5\\), which are unsafe only at \\(T = 12\\), but these turns are after \\(T = 12\\), so safe.\n- At turns 16 to 18, the player is on \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 8\\), which are unsafe at \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\), but these turns are after \\(T = 12\\), so safe.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 10: U (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: U (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 13)\n- Turn 13: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14)\n- Turn 14: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 15)\n- Turn 15: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16)\n- Turn 16: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17)\n- Turn 17: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18)\n- Turn 18: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19)\n- Turn 19: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), position reached)\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 19 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 10 - 1 = 19\\)) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 11 and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car's span (for that freeway) at turn T contains 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note: when moving, at turn T the player is on freeway y_T. If the player moves at turn T from y to y', then at turn T the player is still on y, and at turn T+1 the player will be on y'. So we only check the freeway we are currently on at turn T.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (which is 11). The cars are moving at constant speed. For left-moving cars (d='left'), the car moves to the left (so the head and tail decrease by s*(T-t1) at turn T). For right-moving cars (d='right'), the car moves to the right (so head and tail increase by s*(T-t1)).\n\nNote: The car spans are given at t1. We have to compute the span at any future turn T.\n\nWe have freeways 1 to 8. Each freeway has one or more cars.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y at turn T if there is any car on that freeway such that 0 is in [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving? Actually, let's decode the update:\n\nFor a left-moving car at freeway k:\n  At t1: span = [h, tau] (with h being the head and tau the tail? note: the problem says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> Span(T)= [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\"\nBut note: if the car is moving left, then the entire car moves left. So the head and tail both decrease by s*(T-t1). However, the problem states the span as [h, tau] for left and [tau, h] for right? Actually, the representation for right is given as [tau, h] at t1? But the input for right is given as (head h, tail tau, direction, speed) and then the span is [tau, h]? \n\nLooking at the right-moving example: \n  Input: (60,49,right,12) -> at t1, the span is [49,60]? because the problem says: \"Span(t1)= [tau, h] for right\" -> but wait, the input says (head h, tail tau). \n\nActually, the problem says for right-moving: \n  \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for a car on freeway k at t1:\n  If direction is left: the car's head is at h and tail at tau, and the span at t1 is [h, tau] (which implies h > tau because the head is to the right? but moving left). However, note that the problem writes [h, tau] and then subtracts, so if the car is moving left, the head is at h and the tail at tau, and then at time T the head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1). \n\nBut then the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. However, if h > tau, then the car extends from tau to h? But the problem writes [h, tau] which would be backwards? \n\nActually, the problem states the span as an interval. We must have the head and tail such that the car occupies an interval. For left-moving, the head is the rightmost point? and for right-moving, the head is the leftmost point? \n\nBut note the example for right-moving: \n  At t1: (60,49,right,12) -> the problem says the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [49,60] (so the car is from 49 to 60). Then at time T, it becomes [49+12*(T-t1), 60+12*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  (-60,-25,left,36): at t1, the span is [h, tau] = [-60, -25]? but then the car would be from -60 to -25? which is 35 units long? Then at T, it becomes [-60 - 36*(T-t1), -25 - 36*(T-t1)].\n\nSo the car is a contiguous segment. The condition for collision at turn T on freeway k is: the player is at (0, k) at turn T, and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn t1 (11) to turn t1+H-1 (so the player reaches 9 at turn t1+H-1).\n\nWe start at (0,1) at turn 11.\n\nWe note the freeways we must traverse: from y=1 to y=9? but we start at y=1 and goal is y=9. However, we can also go down to 0? but that might not be helpful. The minimal steps would be to go up 8 times? but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns. Since the cars are moving, we must compute the positions of the cars at every future turn.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is at least 8 (since we need to go from 1 to 9, 8 steps up). However, we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a collision? but going down might be counterproductive.\n\nWe are to minimize H, so we want the fewest turns. Therefore, we want to go up as much as possible without colliding.\n\nWe need to check for each turn T (starting at T=11) and for each freeway we are on, whether we are safe.\n\nWe'll consider the actions: U, D, S. But note: D might lead us to y=0 which is safe (since freeways are only 1-8) but then we have to come back up, increasing H. So we should avoid D unless necessary? However, sometimes we might need to wait by staying or even retreating.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are at (0,1) at turn 11. We are on freeway 1 at turn 11. So we must check the cars on freeway 1 at turn 11? But wait, collision is checked at the turn we are on. So at turn 11, we are on freeway 1. We must check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway 1 at turn 11.\n\nFreeway 1: has a car: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> at T=11, the car is at [-60, -25]. Is 0 in [-60, -25]? \n  -60 <= 0 <= -25? -> no, because 0 is greater than -25? so it's safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says the car update: for left, Span(T)= [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\nAt T=11 (which is t1), we have [h, tau] = [-60, -25]. So 0 is not in [-60, -25]. So safe.\n\nNow, we are at turn 11, position 1. We choose an action. We want to go to 9. We can try to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe'll simulate the next turns. We have to consider the entire sequence until we reach 9.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move continuously. The minimal H is 8 (if we go up 8 times). But we must check if we can go up 8 times without collision.\n\nLet's check the freeways we would step on:\n\nTurn 11: at y=1 -> freeway 1: car is [-60,-25] -> 0 not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose U -> at turn 12, we are at y=2.\n\nBut at turn 12, we are on freeway 2. Check freeway 2: \n  Car: (-60,-25,left,36) at t1=11. \n  At T=12 (so T-t1=1), the car becomes: [-60-36*1, -25-36*1] = [-96, -61]. 0 not in [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen we go U again: turn 13 at y=3.\n\nFreeway 3: cars: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12) at t1=11.\n\nAt T=13 (T-t1=2), \n  First car: [49+12*2, 60+12*2] = [49+24=73, 60+24=84] -> 0 not in [73,84]\n  Second car: [13+24=37, 24+24=48] -> [37,48] -> 0 not in\n  Third car: [-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in? but note: the car is from 1 to 12. 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen turn 14: y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \n  At T=14 (T-t1=3):\n  First car: [49+36=85, 60+36=96]\n  Second: [13+36=49, 24+36=60]\n  Third: [-23+36=13, -12+36=24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: same cars as 3? \n  At T=15 (T-t1=4):\n  First: [49+48=97, 60+48=108]\n  Second: [13+48=61,24+48=72]\n  Third: [-23+48=25, -12+48=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: car: (0,-11,right,6) at t1=11.\n  At T=16 (T-t1=5): \n    For right: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] -> the input is (head=0, tail=-11) -> but wait: the problem for right says: \"Span(t1)= [tau, h]\" so [tau, h] = [-11,0]. Then at T: [-11+6*5, 0+6*5] = [-11+30=19, 0+30=30] -> [19,30]. 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=7.\n\nFreeway 7: car: (0,-11,right,6) -> same as freeway6? \n  At T=17 (T-t1=6): [-11+6*6, 0+6*6] = [-11+36=25, 36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn 18: y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars: (0,-11,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6) at t1=11.\n  First car (0,-11): at T=18 (T-t1=7): [-11+42, 0+42] = [31,42] -> safe.\n  Second car (-48,-59): the head is -48? and tail is -59? but for right, the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? \n    Then at T=18: [-59+6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42=-17, -48+42=-6] -> [-17,-6]. 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen we go U to y=9 at turn 19? \n\nBut note: at turn 18 we are at y=8. Then we do U at turn 18: then at turn 19 we are at y=9. And we are done? because the goal is (0,9) and freeways 1-8 are for cars, but y=9 is the goal and no car check? \n\nThe problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So when we are at y=9, we are not on a freeway? so no collision.\n\nBut wait: we are at y=9 at turn 19. Then the sequence would be 8 ups: \n  Turn11: U -> y=2 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> y=3 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> y=4 at turn14\n  Turn14: U -> y=5 at turn15\n  Turn15: U -> y=6 at turn16\n  Turn16: U -> y=7 at turn17\n  Turn17: U -> y=8 at turn18\n  Turn18: U -> y=9 at turn19\n\nSo H=8? but note: we start at turn11 and we do 8 actions: from t11 to t18 (8 actions) and then at turn19 we are at 9? \n\nBut the problem says: we have a sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1. We are starting at t1 (11) and we are going to do H actions? and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nIf we do 8 actions (from t11 to t18), then the last action is at t18 and then at turn t18+1 = t19 we are at 9? but the problem says we are to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nSo if we let H be the number of actions (turns we take actions), then at the end of the sequence, we have taken H actions and we are at turn t1+H. But the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning:\n\n  t = t1 + 0: first action\n  t = t1 + 1: second action\n  ...\n  t = t1 + (H-1): last action\n\nAnd then at turn t1+H, the player has updated? but note the update: after the last action (at t1+H-1) we get y_{t1+H} = ... \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, the update: at turn t (when we take action a_t) we update to y_{t+1}. So:\n\n  At turn t1: we start at y_{t1}=1.\n  Then we take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 we have y_{t1+1}.\n\n  We take actions until we have y_{t1+H} = 9? but the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd the update: after taking action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we get y_{t1+H} = ... but we require y_{t1+H-1} to be 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t is (x, y_t). Then we choose action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1? \n\nBut the problem says: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then we take action a_T and update to y_{T+1}. \n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the end of the sequence? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} and then we become y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about y_{t1+H} because we have already reached at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. \n\nLooking at the problem: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", so after the action at turn t, we get the new state for turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nBut then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? because the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? meaning we take H actions? so we go from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 (taking H actions) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} which is the result of the last action. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis implies that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action? but we don't need to? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me see the example: if we start at turn t1 (11) at y=1. Then we take one action (H=1) and we want y_{11+1-1}=y_{11}=1? which is not 9. \n\nSo that cannot be. \n\nAlternatively, if we take H actions, then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H is y_{t1+H} = 9. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThis is ambiguous. \n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis would mean that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? which would change our position? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo. \n\nBut note: the example in the problem: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" ... so the actions are taken at the turn when we are at the current state.\n\nWe are at turn t1 at position (0, y_{t1}). We take action a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1 we are at (0, y_{t1+1}). \n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn. \n\nThe minimal H: the number of actions. \n\nSuppose we do 0 actions: then at turn t1 we are at y=1, not 9. \n\nWe do one action: then at turn t1+1 we are at y=1,2, or 0? not 9.\n\nSo we need at least 8 actions to go from 1 to 9 (if we go up 8 times). \n\nThen at turn t1+8, we are at y=9? \n\nSo we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+7 (8 actions). Then at turn t1+8, we are at y=9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nIf H=8, then y_{t1+8-1}=y_{t1+7} should be 9. But at turn t1+7, we are at y=8 (if we went up 7 times) and then at turn t1+8 we go to y=9. \n\nSo that does not match. \n\nAlternatively, if we take 8 actions, then we have:\n\n  Turn t1: action -> at turn t1+1: y=?\n  ...\n  Turn t1+7: action -> at turn t1+8: y=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+8, we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nWith H=8, we require y_{t1+7}=9? but we are at y=8 at turn t1+7? \n\nTherefore, we must have reached 9 at the beginning of turn t1+7? \n\nThat would mean we take 6 actions? because:\n\n  Start at turn t1: y=1.\n  After 1st action (at t1): at turn t1+1: y=2.\n  ...\n  After 6th action (at t1+5): at turn t1+6: y=7.\n  Then at turn t1+6: we are at y=7. Then we take the 7th action at turn t1+6: and go to y=8 at turn t1+7.\n  Then we take the 8th action at turn t1+7: and go to y=9 at turn t1+8.\n\nBut that does not get us to 9 at turn t1+7.\n\nAlternatively, if we start at y=1 at turn t1, and we take one action at turn t1: we go to y=2 at turn t1+1. Then we take action at turn t1+1: go to y=3 at t1+2, ... until at turn t1+7: we take the 7th action to go to y=8? then we need an 8th action at turn t1+7? but we are at turn t1+7 and we take an action to go to y=9 at turn t1+8.\n\nSo we need 8 actions to get to y=9 at turn t1+8.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. That would be turn t1+7 if H=8? but we are at 9 at turn t1+8, not t1+7.\n\nTherefore, I think there might be a misunderstanding. \n\nRe-read the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. And we do not take an action at that turn? but the sequence includes an action for every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nSo if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we do not need to take an action? but the sequence requires an action for turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions for H turns and then at the end of the H-th action, we are at 9. But that is at turn t1+H.\n\nI see the confusion. \n\nLooking at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nThen the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis would mean that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? which would move us away? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nI think there might be a misstatement in the problem. \n\nLet me try to interpret by the update rule:\n\nAt the start of turn t, we are at y_t.\nWe take action a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta a_t, and then we move to the start of turn t+1.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the start of some turn. \n\nIf we are at y=9 at the start of turn T, then we don't necessarily need to take an action at that turn? but the problem requires a sequence of actions until we reach.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions for H consecutive turns starting at t1.\n\nSo after H actions, we will be at turn t1+H, and the state at the start of turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nUnless the indexing is different.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem means that we take an action at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at 9 at the next state, but they want to output the action at turn t1+H-1 and then stop.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1+H-1} = 9? that is the state before the last action.\n\nI think the problem has a typo. It should be y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBecause if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? but the sequence goes to turn t1+H-1.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the minimal steps. We need to go from 1 to 9: that requires 8 steps up. So we will be at 9 at turn t1+8 if we start at t1 and do U every turn.\n\nAnd we take 8 actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+7. Then at turn t1+8, we are at 9.\n\nSo the condition should be y_{t1+8} = 9.\n\nTherefore, the problem likely meant: we require y_{t1+H} = 9, and we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions). Then the last action at t1+H-1 leads to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nI see that in the task section: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is very odd.\n\nPerhaps the turn counting includes the starting turn? \n\nAnother interpretation: \n  Turn t1: we are at y1. We take action a1 and then at the end of turn t1 we have updated to y2? but the problem says the state is at the beginning of the turn.\n\nI think the safest is to follow the update rule as given:\n\n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t   (after action at turn t)\n\nSo if we start at turn t1 with y_{t1}=1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe want to have y_{T} = 9 for some T.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., T-1 (because at turn T-1 we take the last action that gets us to 9 at turn T).\n\nSo the number of actions is T - t1.\n\nThen T = t1 + H? and then the number of actions is H.\n\nBut then we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is off by one.\n\nGiven the confusion, and since in our simulation of 8 consecutive ups we got to y=9 at turn t1+8 (which is 11+8=19) without any collision, and the problem requires minimal turns, we output the 8 actions.\n\nBut let's double-check the collision at every step we did earlier: it was safe.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that at turn 18 (which is t1+7) we are at y=8, and then we take U to go to y=9 at turn 19. But the problem says we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. If we set H=8, then we require at turn 11+8-1=18, we are at 9. But at turn 18 we are at y=8.\n\nTherefore, we must have reached 9 at turn 18. How can we do that? \n\nWe would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 18. That means we must have been at 9 at the beginning of turn 18, so we don't take an action at turn 18? but the sequence requires an action for turn 18.\n\nAlternatively, if we take only 7 actions: \n  actions at turns 11,12,...,17 (7 actions), then at turn 18 we are at y=8? not 9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn 18, we must have taken an action at turn 17 that moved us from 8 to 9, so at turn 18 we are at 9. Then the last action is at turn 17, and we have taken 7 actions.\n\nBut then the sequence would be:\n\n  Turn11: U -> turn12: y=2\n  Turn12: U -> turn13: y=3\n  Turn13: U -> turn14: y=4\n  Turn14: U -> turn15: y=5\n  Turn15: U -> turn16: y=6\n  Turn16: U -> turn17: y=7\n  Then at turn17: we take U and become y=8 at turn18? not 9.\n\nWe need to go from 1 to 9 in 7 actions: that is impossible because each U only increases by 1. We need 8 steps.\n\nTherefore, the problem must have a typo and it should be y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nGiven that, and that 8 consecutive ups work and are safe, we output 8 actions of U.\n\nBut let me verify the freeway at turn 18 (t1+7) for y=8: we did it above and it was safe.\n\nBut note: at turn 18, we are at y=8, and we are about to take the last U. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 (which would be turn 18 if H=8) we are at 9? we are not. We are at 8.\n\nSo if the problem really means that we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we need to get there in 7 actions? which is impossible.\n\n Unless we can move faster? but the actions only change by -1,0,1.\n\nSo it's impossible to do in 7 actions.\n\nThis suggests the problem meant y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nI think we have to assume that. In the answer format, we are to output actions for turns 11 to 11+7 (8 actions) and then at turn 19 we are at 9.\n\nAnd the problem's example output format has multiple turns.\n\nTherefore, I will output 8 U's.\n\nBut wait, is it safe? Let me recheck freeway 6 at turn 16 (t1+5): \n  freeway6: car (0,-11,right,6) at t1=11.\n  T=16 -> T-t1=5.\n  For right: [tau + s*5, head + s*5] = [-11+6*5, 0+6*5] = [-11+30, 30] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway 8 at turn 18 (t1+7): \n  First car: (0,-11,right,6) -> [ -11+6*7, 0+6*7] = [-11+42, 42] = [31,42] -> safe.\n  Second car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [ -59+42, -48+42] = [-17, -6] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway 1 to 5 we already checked.\n\nBut freeway 3 at turn 13 (t1+2): \n  We have three cars: \n    (60,49,right,12) -> [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe.\n    (24,13,right,12) -> [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n    (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12] -> safe? because 0 is not in [1,12].\n\nBut what about freeway 4 at turn 14 (t1+3):\n  (60,49): [49+36,60+36]=[85,96]\n  (24,13): [13+36,24+36]=[49,60]\n  (-12,-23): [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 5 at turn 15 (t1+4): \n  (-12,-23): [-23+48, -12+48]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is there any freeway that might have a car covering 0 at some turn? \n\nLet me check freeway 6: \n  The car (0,-11,right,6) -> span at time T: [ -11+6*(T-11), 0+6*(T-11) ]\n\nWe are on freeway 6 at turn 16 (T=16): [ -11+6*5, 0+30] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\nWhat if we were on freeway 6 at an earlier turn? But we are only on freeway 6 at turn 16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at turn 18: safe.\n\nBut freeway 3: the third car at turn 13: [1,12] -> does not include 0.\n\nHowever, let me check if that car might cover 0 at any turn near there?\n\nThe third car on freeway 3: initial at t1=11: head=-12, tail=-23, right-moving, speed 12.\n\nSpan at t1: [tau, head] = [-23, -12] -> but the problem says for right: the span is [tau, head]? and the input is (head, tail) = (-12,-23). So [ -23, -12] at t1.\n\nAt turn T: [ -23 + 12*(T-11), -12 + 12*(T-11) ]\n\nWe are on freeway 3 at turn 13 (T=13): \n  [ -23 + 12*2, -12 + 12*2] = [-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> [1,12]\n\nNow, does this include 0? no.\n\nBut when would it include 0? \n  We require: -23 + 12*(T-11) <= 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-11)\n\nLet me solve:\n  -23 + 12k <= 0  => 12k <= 23 => k <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916 -> so k=1 or 2.\n  and 0 <= -12 + 12k => 12 <= 12k => k>=1.\n\nSo for k=1: T=12 -> then the span is [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]. At T=12, the car covers 0? \n\nBut we are not on freeway 3 at turn 12. At turn 12, we are on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, at k=2 (T=13): [1,12] -> does not cover 0.\n\nAt T=12: the car is at [-11,0]. So if we were on freeway 3 at turn 12, we would collide. But we are on freeway 2 at turn 12.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: car (0,-11,right,6) -> span at T: [ -11+6*(T-11), 0+6*(T-11) ]\n\nWhen does it cover 0? \n  -11+6k <= 0 <= 0+6k\n  The right part: 0<=6k is always true for k>=0.\n  -11+6k<=0 -> 6k<=11 -> k<=11/6≈1.83.\n\nSo for k=0: T=11: [-11,0] -> covers 0? \n  But at turn 11, we are on freeway 1, not 6.\n\nk=1: T=12: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> covers 0? yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n\nBut at turn 12, we are on freeway 2, not 6.\n\nk=2: T=13: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> does not cover 0.\n\nSo freeway 6 is safe at the turn we are on (T=16).\n\nBut what about freeway 8: the second car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> \n  span at T: [ -59+6*(T-11), -48+6*(T-11) ]\n\nWhen does it cover 0?\n  -59+6k <= 0 <= -48+6k\n\nFirst: -59+6k<=0 -> 6k<=59 -> k<=59/6≈9.83\nSecond: 0<=-48+6k -> 6k>=48 -> k>=8.\n\nSo for k in [8,9]: \n  k=8: T=11+8=19: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n  k=9: T=20: [ -59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> covers 0.\n\nBut we are on freeway 8 at turn 18 (T=18): \n  k=7: [ -59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> does not cover 0.\n\nAnd we are not on freeway 8 at turn 19 or 20.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the 8 consecutive ups work.\n\nBut the problem says we start at (0,1) at turn 11, and we output:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n...\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd then at turn 19 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem requires the condition to be met at turn t1+H-1 = 11+8-1=18? which is y_18=8, not 9.\n\nGiven the above, I think the problem likely meant that we are at 9 at turn t1+H. \n\nSince the problem is ambiguous, and 8 consecutive ups work and are minimal, we output that.\n\nBut to be safe, let's see if there is a sequence that gets us to 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWe need 8 ups. There is no way to do it in fewer than 8 actions.\n\nAnd the above sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 actions of U.\n\nBut note: the current position is at y=1 at turn 11. We are about to take the first action at turn 11.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nThis means we take U at turn 11, then at turn 12 we are at y=2, and so on, until at turn 19 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and we have checked: at each turn T from 11 to 18, when we are on freeway y (which is from 1 to 8 respectively) we are safe.\n\nWe don't check at turn 19 because we are at y=9, not a freeway.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\nHowever, to confirm, is there any freeway at any of these turns that we haven't checked? \n\nWe did:\n\nTurn11: freeway1 -> safe\nTurn12: freeway2 -> safe\nTurn13: freeway3 -> safe\nTurn14: freeway4 -> safe\nTurn15: freeway5 -> safe\nTurn16: freeway6 -> safe\nTurn17: freeway7 -> safe\nTurn18: freeway8 -> safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn 11 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. The minimal number of turns required is 8, as the player must move up 8 times to go from y = 1 to y = 9. \n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to y = 2.\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to y = 3.\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to y = 4.\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to y = 5.\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to y = 6.\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to y = 7.\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to y = 8.\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to y = 9.\n\nCollisions are avoided because:\n- At each turn, the player is on a freeway y, and the cars on that freeway at the corresponding turn do not have a span that includes 0 (the player's x-coordinate).\n- Detailed car positions at each turn confirm safety:\n  - Turn 11 (y=1): Car at [-60, -25] → 0 not in span.\n  - Turn 12 (y=2): Car at [-96, -61] → 0 not in span.\n  - Turn 13 (y=3): Cars at [73, 84], [37, 48], [1, 12] → 0 not in any span.\n  - Turn 14 (y=4): Cars at [85, 96], [49, 60], [13, 24] → 0 not in any span.\n  - Turn 15 (y=5): Cars at [97, 108], [61, 72], [25, 36] → 0 not in any span.\n  - Turn 16 (y=6): Car at [19, 30] → 0 not in span.\n  - Turn 17 (y=7): Car at [25, 36] → 0 not in span.\n  - Turn 18 (y=8): Cars at [31, 42] and [-17, -6] → 0 not in any span.\n\nThe player reaches (0, 9) at turn 19, which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 12, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n Player movement:\n   U: y increases by 1 (if not at 9)\n   D: y decreases by 1 (if not at 0)\n   S: stay (y remains)\n\n Important: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway (y in {1,...,8}) and at that same turn, there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span (i.e., the car covers the x=0 position at that turn).\n\n Note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y. At turn T, we check the freeway y (the current one). When we move, at the next turn (T+1) we are on y'. So we only check the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\n The car spans are given at turn t_1=12. For any future turn T (>=12), the car positions are updated by moving left or right at their speed.\n\n We are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 12 to turn 12+H-1 such that at turn 12+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that we start at y=2 at turn 12. We need to get to y=9. The minimal vertical moves would be 7 moves upward (if no obstacles). But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 2 to 8 (we are currently on freeway 2 at turn12? Actually, we are at y=2, which is freeway 2? Note: freeways are y=1,2,...,8. So y=2 is freeway 2).\n\n 2. We must check for each freeway we are going to be on at each turn, whether at that turn there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span.\n\n 3. We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state: (turn, y) to find the minimal turns to reach y=9. The turn starts at 12 and we go forward. We consider actions U, D, S. But note that we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\n 4. However, the state space in time might be large? But note that the cars are moving at integer speeds and we can compute the car positions at any turn T. Also, the minimal H is at least 7 (if we go up without delay) and we can bound the search by, say, 20 turns? But let's see.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can precompute for each freeway and each turn (starting from 12) whether the freeway is safe at that turn (i.e., no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn).\n\n 6. But note: we are only on one freeway per turn. And we are only concerned with the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\n How to compute car positions at turn T (>=12) for a given freeway?\n\n For a car on freeway k at turn 12 with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, t, d, s):\n   - If direction is 'left', then at turn T, the car's head becomes h - s*(T-12), and tail becomes t - s*(T-12). The span is [h - s*(T-12), t - s*(T-12)]? But note: for a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the problem says:\n        Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n        Right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   But note: the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but then the span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head? Actually, the problem states:\n        For left: initial span [h, τ] (so h is the right end and τ is the left end) and then both decrease by s*(T-t1).\n        For right: initial span [τ, h] (so τ is the left end and h is the right end) and then both increase by s*(T-t1).\n\n   However, in the input, for right-moving cars, the head and tail are given in the tuple? Let's look at the input:\n\n        Freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> so head=-48, tail=-59? But then the span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? Actually, the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\". So in the input, the first number is head? but then for right they write [τ, h]. This is confusing.\n\n   Let me re-read:\n\n        \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\n   Then:\n\n        Left: [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n        Right: [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   But wait: for a right-moving car, the head is the front? and the front is the rightmost? So if the car is moving right, then the head is the right end. Then the initial span should be [tail, head] = [τ, h]. So the input for a right car is (h, τ) meaning head=h and tail=τ? Then the span is [τ, h]. Similarly, for left: head is the front (which is leftmost? no) wait: for left-moving, the head is the front and that would be the leftmost? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the front (head) is the leftmost? But the problem says for left: [h, τ] and then moves left. Actually, the problem states:\n\n        Left-moving: at t1: [h, τ] -> meaning from h to τ? and h and τ are coordinates? and then both decrease.\n\n   But if the car is moving left, then the entire car moves left. So if at t1, the car is from h to τ (with h > τ, because moving left the head is at a larger x and then decreases) then the span [h, τ] would be [τ, h] if h>τ? But the problem writes [h, τ] and then subtracts. So we must interpret the span as an interval. However, the problem does not specify which is larger.\n\n   Let me clarify with an example: \n        Left-moving car at t1: head=10, tail=5, then the car occupies [5,10] (if head is the front and moving left, then the front is at 10 and the tail at 5? but then when moving left, the front moves to 10-?).\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \n        Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] -> but if h=10, τ=5, then [10,5] is not standard. So I think we must assume that the head is the leading part and the tail is the trailing part. For a left-moving car, the head is at a greater x than the tail? Then the car spans from the head (rightmost) to the tail (leftmost)? That doesn't make sense because if it moves left, then the head (leading part) should be the leftmost? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have a consistent representation: \n        For a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost? Then the car is at [h, τ] meaning from h to τ, but then if h < τ, the car would be from h to τ? But then moving left: both h and τ decrease -> the entire car moves left.\n\n   However, the problem says: \n        Left: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] -> so the entire interval shifts left.\n\n   Similarly, right: [τ, h] becomes [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] -> shifts right.\n\n   But the problem does not specify that h and τ are in increasing order? \n\n   Let's look at the input:\n\n        Freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> then at t1=12, the span is [48,83]? and moving left: so at a future turn, it moves left.\n\n        Freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,12): for right, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? because the input gives (head, tail) = (-48,-59) and then for right, we use [tail, head] = [-59,-48]. Then moving right: both increase.\n\n   So the interpretation:\n\n        For a car (h, τ, d, s):\n          if d = 'left': the car occupies the interval [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? But the update: [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] might not be increasing? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the order of h and τ. However, the update rule shifts the entire interval. So we can represent the interval as [min, max] regardless? But the update rule subtracts the same amount? So the relative order remains.\n\n        However, the collision condition is: if 0 is in the span at turn T. So we care about the interval [a,b] (which is [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] for left, and [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] for right) and we need to check if 0 is between a and b (inclusive).\n\n        But note: for left, we have two points: h' = h - s*(T-12) and τ' = τ - s*(T-12). The span is the interval between these two? It could be [h', τ'] if h'<=τ' or [τ', h'] if τ'<=h'. Actually, the problem doesn't specify. But the collision condition is: 0 ∈ Span(T). So we can define:\n\n          For left: the span is the closed interval [min(h', τ'), max(h', τ')]\n          For right: the span is the closed interval [min(τ', h'), max(τ', h')]? But wait, for right, the update is [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] -> so we have two points: τ+s*dt and h+s*dt. Then the span is the interval between these two.\n\n        However, the problem states the update for right as [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] meaning an interval? Then we can take it as the interval from the smaller to the larger? But note: the problem says for right: \"Span(T)=[τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]\". This might be written as [left_end, right_end]? \n\n        Actually, the problem says for right: [τ, h] becomes [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So if originally [τ, h] is [left_end, right_end] (so τ <= h), then after update we have [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] which is still increasing. Similarly, for left: [h, τ] becomes [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt] -> if originally [h, τ] is [right_end, left_end] (so h>=τ) then after update, we have [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt] which is decreasing? \n\n        This is confusing. Let me assume the following:\n\n          For a left-moving car: the initial head h is the rightmost point and the tail τ is the leftmost? Then the car spans [τ, h] (so from left to right). But the problem writes [h, τ] and then subtracts? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be representing the span as [start, end] regardless of order? But then the interval would be from min to max.\n\n        To avoid confusion, we can compute the two endpoints and then check if 0 is between the min and max of the two.\n\n        So for a car at turn T:\n\n          if left: \n              endpoint1 = h - s*(T-12)\n              endpoint2 = τ - s*(T-12)\n              span = [min(endpoint1, endpoint2), max(endpoint1, endpoint2)]\n\n          if right:\n              endpoint1 = τ + s*(T-12)\n              endpoint2 = h + s*(T-12)\n              span = [min(endpoint1, endpoint2), max(endpoint1, endpoint2)]\n\n        Then collision if 0 is in [min, max] (inclusive).\n\n 7. Now, we precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting from 12) whether the freeway k is safe at turn T (i.e., no car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span).\n\n    But note: a freeway k at turn T may have multiple cars. We must check all cars on that freeway.\n\n 8. Given the car state at turn 12:\n\n        Freeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n        Freeway 2: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n        Freeway 3: three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)   -> note: the second car: (36,25,right,12): head=36, tail=25? then for right: span at t1: [25,36] -> becomes [25+12*(T-12), 36+12*(T-12)]\n        Freeway 4: same as 3\n        Freeway 5: same as 3\n        Freeway 6: one car: (6,-5,right,6) -> at t1: [-5,6]? (because for right: [tail, head] = [-5,6])\n        Freeway 7: same as 6\n        Freeway 8: two cars: (6,-5,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\n    We need to compute for each freeway and for turns T>=12 the safety.\n\n 9. How far in time do we need to compute? We are going to simulate until we reach y=9. The minimal steps is 7 (if we go up without stopping). But we might have to wait (use S) or even go down? So we might need to simulate until, say, 20 turns? But let's compute the car positions and see when they are safe.\n\n 10. Precomputation for each freeway k and for turns T from 12 to, say, 12+20 = 32.\n\n 11. We'll create a 2D array: safe[k][T] for k in [1,8] and T in [12,32] (we can extend if needed) that is True if at turn T, freeway k has no car that covers 0.\n\n 12. Let's compute for each car on each freeway at turn T:\n\n      For freeway 1: car (48,83,left,36)\n          T: 12 -> endpoints: 48 - 36*(0) = 48, 83 - 36*(0)=83 -> [48,83] -> 0 not in [48,83] -> safe for this car? but there might be multiple cars? only one -> so freeway1 at T=12 is safe? \n          But wait, we are at turn 12, and we are at y=2. We are not on freeway1 at turn12? we are on freeway2. But we are computing for future.\n\n      However, we are at turn12, and we are at y=2. At turn12, we are on freeway2 -> we must check freeway2 at turn12.\n\n      Let's compute freeway2 at T=12: car (48,83,left,36) -> same as above: [48,83] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n      But what about freeway3 at T=12? \n          car1: (-48,-59,right,12): \n              endpoints: τ+s*0 = -59+0 = -59, h+s*0=-48 -> so [-59,-48] -> 0 not in.\n          car2: (36,25,right,12): \n              endpoints: τ=25, h=36 -> at T=12: [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n          car3: (0,-11,right,12): \n              endpoints: τ=-11, h=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in! -> so freeway3 at T=12 is not safe.\n\n      Similarly, freeway4,5 same as 3 -> not safe at T=12.\n\n      Freeway6: car (6,-5,right,6): at T=12: [-5,6] -> 0 is in! -> not safe.\n\n      Freeway7: same as 6 -> not safe.\n\n      Freeway8: \n          car1: (6,-5,right,6): [-5,6] -> 0 in -> not safe.\n          car2: (-42,-53,right,6): endpoints: τ=-53, h=-42 -> at T=12: [-53,-42] -> 0 not in -> but the first car already makes it unsafe.\n\n 13. So at turn12, we are at y=2 (freeway2) which is safe. Then we can choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\n 14. We need to plan a path from y=2 at turn12 to y=9 at some future turn.\n\n 15. We can use BFS in the state (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 12) and y in {0,1,...,9}. We avoid states where at turn t, if y is in [1,8] (freeway) and the freeway y is not safe at turn t.\n\n 16. Steps for BFS:\n\n        Queue: (turn, y, path_actions)   # path_actions: list of actions taken from turn12 to current turn (exclusive? or inclusive?) \n        We start at (12, 2, []) \n\n        For each state (t, y, path), we consider actions: U, D, S (if applicable).\n\n        For an action a:\n            next_y = y + delta(a)   (if within [0,9])\n            Then we are at (t+1, next_y) at turn t+1.\n\n        But note: at turn t (current turn) we are on freeway y (if y in [1,8]) and we must check that freeway y is safe at turn t.\n\n        However, we are about to leave the state (t,y) and go to (t+1, next_y). The critical point: at turn t, we are still on freeway y (if y in [1,8]) and we must not collide at that turn.\n\n        So when we are in state (t,y), we must check that if y is in [1,8], then the freeway y at turn t is safe. If not, we cannot be in that state.\n\n        Therefore, when we generate the state (t,y) we must check its safety. But in BFS, we generate (t+1, next_y) from (t,y). So we check the state (t,y) when we pop it? or when we generate it? \n\n        Actually, we should check the state (t,y) when we are going to use it to generate next states. So when we pop (t,y,path) from the queue, we first check: if y in [1,8] and freeway y is unsafe at turn t -> then skip (this state is invalid).\n\n        But note: if y=0 or y=9, we don't check (since no freeway).\n\n        Then, if the state is safe, we consider the next actions.\n\n        Then, for each action, we compute next_y and next_t = t+1.\n\n        Then we check if next_y is in [0,9] and then we can push (next_t, next_y, path + [a]) if we haven't visited (next_t, next_y) with a lower or equal turn? But we are doing BFS so we are going by increasing turn.\n\n        We mark visited states by (t,y) to avoid duplicates? But note: we might come to the same y at a later turn and that might be necessary if we are waiting? but if we found a way to (t,y) and then we find another way to (t',y) with t'>=t, then we don't need to consider if we are looking for minimal turns. Actually, we are doing BFS by turn: so we process states by increasing t. So if we have state (t,y) and we already visited y at a turn <= t, we can skip? But wait: we might come to the same y at a later turn and then have a better path to the goal? Actually, we are doing BFS so the first time we reach (y=9) we have the minimal turns.\n\n        However, we might have to wait and then go, so we might need to consider multiple times at the same y? But note: we are doing BFS by time: so we process by increasing t. Therefore, if we have a state (t,y) and we have already visited y at the same or earlier time, we don't need to revisit at a later time? Actually, if we have already visited y at time t0 <= t, then we don't need to consider a state at (t,y) because we would have already expanded from (t0,y) and we are only going forward in time. So we can mark visited by (y) only? But wait: we might come to the same y at a later time and then take a different path? and that might avoid obstacles? \n\n        Example: at y=3, if we come at turn 13 and then we cannot go up because freeway4 is unsafe at turn14, but if we come at turn14 to y=3, then freeway4 at turn15 might be safe. So we cannot use just y to mark visited. We must use (t,y). \n\n        But note: the safety conditions change with time. So we must consider the same y at different times.\n\n        Therefore, we mark visited: (t,y). Since we are doing BFS by time (t increases), we will only visit each (t,y) once.\n\n 17. We start BFS:\n\n        Let Q be a queue. We start: (t=12, y=2, path=[])\n\n        Then we pop (12,2,[]). Check: at turn12, y=2 (freeway2) -> we computed freeway2 at turn12: safe (because [48,83] doesn't contain 0). So we expand.\n\n        Actions: \n            U: next_y=3 -> state (13,3, [U])\n            D: next_y=1 -> state (13,1, [D])\n            S: next_y=2 -> state (13,2, [S])\n\n        Then we push these.\n\n        Then we pop the next states.\n\n        For (13,3, [U]): at turn13, we are on freeway3? -> y=3. We must check freeway3 at turn13.\n\n        How to compute freeway3 at turn13 (T=13, dt=1):\n\n            Car1: (-48,-59,right,12): \n                endpoints: τ+s*dt = -59+12*1 = -47, h+s*dt = -48+12 = -36 -> so the car is now at [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36]? Actually, we have two endpoints: -59+12*1 = -47, and -48+12*1 = -36 -> so the interval is [-47,-36]? Then 0 is not in -> safe for this car.\n\n            Car2: (36,25,right,12): \n                endpoints: 25+12=37, 36+12=48 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n\n            Car3: (0,-11,right,12): \n                endpoints: -11+12=1, 0+12=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n            So freeway3 at turn13 is safe.\n\n            Then we can expand from (13,3): actions U, D, S.\n\n            U: next_y=4 -> (14,4, [U,U])\n            D: next_y=2 -> (14,2, [U,D])\n            S: next_y=3 -> (14,3, [U,S])\n\n        Similarly, we do for (13,1): freeway1 at turn13.\n\n            Freeway1: car (48,83,left,36): \n                endpoints: 48-36*1 = 12, 83-36*1=47 -> [12,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n            Then actions: U, D, S.\n\n        And for (13,2): freeway2 at turn13.\n\n            Freeway2: same car: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> safe.\n\n        Then we continue.\n\n        We stop when we pop a state with y=9 (and then we output the path).\n\n        But note: we are at (0,9) -> so when we are at y=9, we don't check any freeway. So we can stop.\n\n        Also, we must avoid states that are unsafe: if at state (t,y) and y in [1,8] and freeway y at turn t is unsafe, then we skip.\n\n 18. However, we must precompute the safety for each freeway and for each turn from 12 to the maximum turn we might reach. Since we are doing BFS and we are going to stop at the first time we reach y=9, we can compute on the fly? But we need to compute the car positions for any turn T. Alternatively, we can precompute for a range of turns (say 12 to 40) and store in a 2D list.\n\n 19. Let's precompute for freeways 1..8 and for turns from 12 to 40 (which is 29 turns) the safety.\n\n    We'll create a list: safe[k][t] for k in range(1,9) and t in range(12,41) -> boolean: True if safe.\n\n    How to compute for one freeway k and one turn T (>=12):\n\n        dt = T - 12\n\n        For each car on freeway k:\n\n            if direction 'left':\n                e1 = h - s * dt\n                e2 = τ - s * dt\n                low = min(e1, e2)\n                high = max(e1, e2)\n                if low <= 0 <= high -> then this car causes collision -> unsafe for this car -> so the freeway is unsafe at T.\n\n            if direction 'right':\n                e1 = τ + s * dt\n                e2 = h + s * dt\n                low = min(e1, e2)\n                high = max(e1, e2)\n                if low <= 0 <= high -> unsafe.\n\n        If any car on freeway k at turn T causes collision, then safe[k][T] = False, else True.\n\n 20. Now, we do the BFS.\n\n 21. We'll create a visited set: set of (t,y) that we have already expanded.\n\n 22. We start:\n\n        queue: collections.deque()\n        start: (t=12, y=2, path=[])\n\n        visited: set((12,2))\n\n        while queue:\n            pop state (t, y, path)\n\n            if y==9: we output the path and break.\n\n            Check if y in [1,8]: \n                if safe[y][t] is False -> skip this state (because at this turn we are on an unsafe freeway) -> so we cannot be here.\n            If y==0 or y==9: we don't check (but y==9 we break, and y==0: we can be there without checking freeway)\n\n            Then, for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n\n                next_y = y + delta\n                next_t = t+1\n\n                If next_y is not in [0,9]: skip.\n\n                If (next_t, next_y) is not visited, then we add to visited and push (next_t, next_y, path + [action])\n\n        We do BFS (queue is FIFO) so we get the minimal turns.\n\n 23. But note: we might have multiple paths with the same number of turns? BFS will find the one with minimal turns.\n\n 24. However, we are going to compute the safety for each freeway at each turn from 12 to 40. Let's do that first.\n\n 25. Precomputation:\n\n        safe[k][t] for k in [1,8] and t in [12,40]\n\n        We'll use a 2D list: safe[i][t] where i from 1 to 8, but index: we can make an array for each freeway.\n\n        Cars per freeway (as given):\n\n            k=1: [ (48,83,'left',36) ]\n            k=2: [ (48,83,'left',36) ]\n            k=3: [ (-48,-59,'right',12), (36,25,'right',12), (0,-11,'right',12) ]\n            k=4: same as k=3\n            k=5: same as k=3\n            k=6: [ (6,-5,'right',6) ]\n            k=7: same as k=6\n            k=8: [ (6,-5,'right',6), (-42,-53,'right',6) ]\n\n        For k=3,4,5: same cars.\n\n        For k=6,7: same.\n\n        For k=8: two cars.\n\n 26. Let's compute for each freeway:\n\n        Freeway1: \n            car: (48,83,'left',36)\n            For t from 12 to 40 (dt=0 to 28):\n                e1 = 48 - 36*dt\n                e2 = 83 - 36*dt\n                low = min(e1,e2) = 48-36*dt (since 48<83 and subtracting same, so e1<e2) -> but actually: as dt increases, both decrease. \n                We need: is 0 in [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]? \n                -> 48-36*dt <= 0 <= 83-36*dt?\n                Solve: \n                    48-36*dt <= 0 -> 36*dt>=48 -> dt>=48/36=1.333 -> so for dt>=2, the lower bound is negative? but the upper bound: 83-36*dt>=0 -> 36*dt<=83 -> dt<=83/36≈2.3 -> so only at dt=2: \n                    dt=2: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in? yes -> so at t=12+2=14, freeway1 is unsafe?\n                Actually, at dt=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> safe.\n                dt=2: [-24,11] -> unsafe (because 0 in between)\n                dt=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe?

So at turn12+7-1 = turn18 we might get to y=9? \n\n        But we have to avoid unsafe freeways. We might need to wait sometimes.\n\n        However, we are doing BFS and we will find the minimal H.\n\n 29. We'll write code for BFS?

Actually, we had (13,3) from the first expansion with U, and then from (13,2) with U? Let me check the parent:\n\n                    Actually, we have:\n                        (14,3): \n                            one from (13,3) with S: path ['U','S'] \n                            one from (13,2) with U: path ['S','U'] \n                (4): from (13,3) with U: path ['U','U'] -> (14,4)\n\n        Level3 (t=15):\n\n            Expand (14,0): \n                actions: \n                    U: (15,1) -> freeway1 at t15: safe -> push (15,1,['D','D','U'])\n                    D: invalid.\n                    S: (15,0) -> safe (not freeway) -> push (15,0,['D','D','S'])\n\n            Expand (14,3): \n                We have two states at (14,3) but we don't care about the path until we reach the goal? We just need one minimal path. But we mark visited (t,y) so we only process (14,3) once? Actually, we should avoid duplicates at the same (t,y). So we only expand one of them? \n\n                However, we are doing BFS: we push all states, but if we have (15,4) from multiple paths, we will mark (15,4) as visited and not push again? So we can mark when we first reach (t,y).\n\n                But for now, we consider:\n\n                Actions from (14,3): \n                    U: (15,4) -> freeway4 at t15: safe? freeway4: t15: dt=3 -> safe -> push (15,4, path + ['U']) -> but which path? \n                        Let's take one: say we take the path from (13,3) with S: so ['U','S','U'] \n                    D: (15,2) -> freeway2 at t15: safe? dt=3 -> safe -> push (15,2,['U','S','D'] or ['S','U','D'])\n                    S: (15,3) -> freeway3 at t15: safe -> push (15,3, ...)\n\n            Expand (14,4): \n                actions:\n                    U: (15,5) -> freeway5 at t15: safe? freeway5: same as freeway3: unsafe only at t12 and t16 -> safe -> push (15,5,['U','U','U'])\n                    D: (15,3) -> freeway3 at t15: safe -> push (15,3,['U','U','D'])\n                    S: (15,4) -> freeway4 at t15: safe -> push (15,4,['U','U','S'])\n\n            So at t=15, we have: \n                y=0: ['D','D','S'] -> state (15,0)\n                y=1: ['D','D','U'] -> state (15,1)\n                y=2: from (14,3) with D: ['U','S','D'] -> (15,2)\n                y=3: from (14,3) with S: ... and from (14,4) with D: ... \n                y=4: from (14,3) with U: ... and from (14,4) with S: ...\n                y=5: from (14,4) with U: (15,5)\n\n        We continue until we get to y=9.\n\n        We note that we are at turn15 and we are at y=5. We need 4 more moves up. But we have to avoid freeway5 at t16: unsafe! So we cannot be on freeway5 (y=5) at turn16.\n\n        So at turn16, if we are at y=5, we will collide.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid being at y=5 at turn16.\n\n        How to avoid? \n\n            At turn15, if we are at y=5, we must not stay at y=5 at the next turn (turn16) because that would be unsafe. So we can move up to y=6 at turn16? But then at turn16 we are on freeway6 -> we check freeway6 at turn16: safe (since freeway6 is safe for t>=13). \n\n            Or we can move down? but that would be moving away.\n\n        So one plan: \n\n            turn15: at y=5 -> then at turn16: move U to y=6 -> then at turn16 we are on freeway6: safe.\n\n        Then from y=6, we can move up to y=7, then to 8, then to 9.\n\n        So total turns: from turn12 to turn19? \n\n            turn12: start at 2\n            turn13: 3\n            turn14: 4\n            turn15: 5\n            turn16: 6\n            turn17: 7\n            turn18: 8\n            turn19: 9 -> done.\n\n        But is there a faster path? Minimal moves is 7 moves: so we need 7 upward moves. We did 7 moves: but we had to wait? \n\n        Actually, we moved: \n            turn12: U -> to 3\n            turn13: U -> to 4\n            turn14: U -> to 5\n            turn15: U -> to 6\n            turn16: U -> to 7\n            turn17: U -> to 8\n            turn18: U -> to 9 -> then at turn18 we are at 9? \n\n        But wait: we started at turn12 at y=2. Then:\n\n            turn12: at y=2 (safe) -> then we do U -> at turn13: at y=3 (safe)\n            turn13: at y=3 -> U -> turn14: y=4 (safe)\n            turn14: at y=4 -> U -> turn15: y=5 (safe) -> but then at turn15: we are at y=5 -> and we do U at turn15: then at turn16: we are at y=6.\n\n            But we are at y=5 at turn15: and then we leave at turn16 to y=6. We are not at y=5 at turn16? so we avoid the collision at turn16 on freeway5.\n\n        Then:\n\n            turn16: at y=6 -> U -> turn17: y=7\n            turn17: at y=7 -> U -> turn18: y=8\n            turn18: at y=8 -> U -> turn19: y=9 -> done.\n\n        But that's 7 moves: from 2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 7 moves -> 7 turns? \n\n        How many turns? \n\n            turn12: we start at y=2 (we haven't taken any action at turn12? we are at the beginning of turn12 at y=2). \n\n            We take an action at turn12: so after the action, at the next turn (turn13) we are at y=3.\n\n            We need to be at y=9 at the end of turn t. \n\n            After H actions, we are at turn12+H, and at that turn we are at y=?\n\n            We start: turn12: state (12,2) -> then we do an action, and at turn13 we are at next_y.\n\n            To get to y=9, we need 7 moves up. So the minimal H is 7: \n\n                turn12: action1 -> at turn13: y=3\n                turn13: action2 -> turn14: y=4\n                ...\n                turn18: action7 -> turn19: y=9.\n\n            So H=7, and we are at turn19.\n\n        But we must check the safety along the way:\n\n            turn12: at y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (t12: freeway2 safe)\n            turn13: at y=3 (freeway3) -> safe (t13: freeway3 safe)\n            turn14: at y=4 (freeway4) -> safe (t14: freeway4 safe)\n            turn15: at y=5 (freeway5) -> safe (t15: freeway5 safe) -> because freeway5 unsafe only at t12 and t16? so t15 safe.\n            turn16: at y=6 (freeway6) -> safe (freeway6 safe for t>=13, and t16>=13)\n            turn17: at y=7 (freeway7) -> safe (same as freeway6: safe for t>=13)\n            turn18: at y=8 (freeway8) -> we must check: t18: freeway8 at t18: we computed unsafe at t19? no, unsafe at t12,19,20 -> so t18: safe.\n\n            Then at turn19: we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\n        So the path: \n            turn12: U\n            turn13: U\n            turn14: U\n            turn15: U\n            turn16: U\n            turn17: U\n            turn18: U\n\n        But wait: at turn18: we are at y=8, and we do U -> then at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\n        So the actions: \n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n\n        Total 7 actions.\n\n        Is there a path with H=6? that would require moving up 7 steps in 6 moves? impossible because each U moves one step.\n\n        So minimal H=7.\n\n        But we must check: at turn15: we are at y=5 at turn15 (safe) and then at turn16 we move to y=6. But note: at turn16, freeway5 is unsafe? but we are not on freeway5 at turn16, we are on freeway6. So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is 7 U's.\n\n 30. However, we must write the actions for turns 12 to 18.\n\n        Turn 12: U\n        Turn 13: U\n        Turn 14: U\n        Turn 15: U\n        Turn 16: U\n        Turn 17: U\n        Turn 18: U\n\n 31. But wait: we start at turn12 at y=2. After turn12:U, we go to y=3 at turn13.\n        Then turn13:U -> y=4 at turn14.\n        Then turn14:U -> y=5 at turn15.\n        Then turn15:U -> y=6 at turn16.\n        Then turn16:U -> y=7 at turn17.\n        Then turn17:U -> y=8 at turn18.\n        Then turn18:U -> y=9 at turn19.\n\n        But the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn12+H-1. So we want at turn12+7-1 = turn18 to be at y=9? \n\n        But we are at y=9 at turn19. \n\n        How many actions? We take 7 actions: from turn12 to turn18 (inclusive) -> that's 7 actions. And at the end of the 7th action (at turn18) we are at y=9. So the turn index: \n\n            After 0 actions: turn12 (starting at y=2)\n            After 1 action: turn12: we do a0 -> then at turn13 we are at y0+1.\n            ...\n            After 7 actions: we are at turn12+7 = turn19, and we are at y=9.\n\n        So the sequence is for turns: 12,13,14,15,16,17,18 -> 7 actions.\n\n        And we are at turn19 (which is the next turn) at y=9.\n\n        But the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn12+H-1. \n\n            H = number of turns = 7.\n            Then we are at turn12+7-1 = turn18? \n\n        But we are at turn19. \n\n        Let me re-read the problem:\n\n            \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\n            So we start at t1 (turn12) and we do actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\n            Then at turn = t1 + H, the player position is updated by the last action? \n\n            But the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n            So at the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=2.\n            Then at turn t1 (which is turn12) we do an action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 (turn13) we have y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n\n            Then after H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), we are at turn t1+H, and we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n            So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at y=9.\n\n            Therefore, we want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\n            The goal: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\n            The problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> wait, let me read:\n\n            \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n            And then: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n            But note: the sequence of actions has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\n            After the first action (at t1) we are at turn t1+1 at y_{t1+1}.\n            ...\n            After the last action (at t1+H-1) we are at turn t1+H at y_{t1+H}.\n\n            But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> that would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? or after the action? \n\n            Actually, the player position is updated at the next turn. \n\n            The problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" -> so at turn t, we do an action, and then at the next turn we update.\n\n            Therefore, at the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=2.\n            Then we do an action at turn t1, and then at the start of turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}= y_{t1} + Delta.\n\n            So the position at the start of turn t is y_t.\n\n            We want at the start of turn t1+H to be at y_{t1+H}=9? \n\n            But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> so at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\n            Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1? and then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta.\n\n            But we want to be at 9 at the start of a turn? \n\n            The problem: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" the player is at (0,9). \n\n            But note: the collision condition: at turn T, we are at y_T. And we are at (0, y_T). \n\n            And we want at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n            So we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n            How is that achieved?\n\n            We start at turn12: y12=2.\n            Then at turn12 we do an action a12 -> then at turn13: y13 = y12 + Delta.\n\n            So to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\n            How many actions? We do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n            But the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1: meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\n            Then after the last action a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1), we update to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\n            So we are not at 9 at turn t1+H-1, but at the next turn? \n\n            The problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> so we require the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 to be 9, and then we do an action? \n\n            But then we would be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we do an action and leave? \n\n            How do we achieve being at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1? \n\n            That means we got to 9 by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\n            Example: \n                H=1: then we do action at turn t1 (turn12) and we want at turn t1+1-1 = turn12: we are at 9? but we start at 2 -> impossible.\n\n            Actually, the minimal H is 7: we want to be at 9 at turn12+H-1.\n\n            So 12+H-1 = 12+7-1 = 18. So we want at turn18 to be at 9.\n\n            How? \n                Start: turn12: y12=2.\n                Then at turn12: we do a12 -> then at turn13: y13 = 2 + Delta.\n                ...\n                At turn17: we do a17 -> then at turn18: y18 = y17 + Delta.\n\n            So to have y18=9, we must have done 7 moves? \n\n                We need to go from 2 to 9: 7 steps up.\n\n                So we do 7 U's.\n\n                Then:\n                    turn12: U -> y13 = 3\n                    turn13: U -> y14 = 4\n                    turn14: U -> y15 = 5\n                    turn15: U -> y16 = 6\n                    turn16: U -> y17 = 7\n                    turn17: U -> y18 = 8\n                    turn18: U -> y19 = 9 -> but we are at turn19, not turn18.\n\n            We want y18=9.\n\n            How? We start at turn12: y12=2.\n            We do an action at turn12: and then at turn13 we are at 3.\n            We do an action at turn13: then at turn14 we are at 4.\n            ...\n            We do an action at turn17: then at turn18 we are at 9.\n\n            How many actions? 6 actions: U from turn12 to turn17.\n\n            Then H=6? because we do actions at turn12,13,14,15,16,17 -> 6 actions.\n\n            Then we are at y18=9.\n\n            So H=6.\n\n            Then the sequence: \n                turn12: U -> to 3 at turn13\n                turn13: U -> to 4 at turn14\n                turn14: U -> to 5 at turn15\n                turn15: U -> to 6 at turn16\n                turn16: U -> to 7 at turn17\n                turn17: U -> to 8 at turn18? -> wait, we need to 9.\n\n            We did 6 U's: 2+6=8 -> so we are at 8 at turn18.\n\n            We need one more U to get to 9.\n\n            So we need 7 U's: and then we are at 9 at turn19.\n\n            How to be at 9 at turn18? \n\n            We start at 2 at turn12. We need to cover 7 units in 6 moves? that would require moving more than one per move? not allowed.\n\n            Therefore, we must be at 9 at turn19, so H=7.\n\n            Then the condition: we want y_{t1+H-1} = y_{12+7-1}=y18=9? \n\n            But with 7 U's, at turn18 we are at y18 = 2+7? but we only did 6 moves by the end of turn17? \n\n            Let me define:\n\n                Let t0 = 12.\n                At the start of turn t0: y0 = 2.\n                Action at t0: a0 -> then at the start of turn t0+1: y1 = y0 + Delta(a0)\n\n                Action at t0+1: a1 -> then at the start of turn t0+2: y2 = y1 + Delta(a1)\n\n                ...\n\n                Action at t0+H-1: a_{H-1} -> then at the start of turn t0+H: y_H = y_{H-1} + Delta(a_{H-1})\n\n            We want y_{t0+H-1} = 9? \n\n            That is the state at the start of turn t0+H-1 is 9.\n\n            How many actions have been taken to get there? \n\n                We have taken actions at t0, t0+1, ..., t0+H-2 -> H-1 actions.\n\n            Then we move from 2 to 9: 7 steps -> so we need 7 actions? then H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\n            But we want minimal H.\n\n            Alternatively, we want to be at 9 at the start of turn t0+H-1, and then we do the last action at turn t0+H-1? but then we would leave 9? \n\n            The problem does not say we have to stay at 9. It only says to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n            So we can be at 9 at the start of turn t0+H-1, and then we do an action (any) at that turn? but then we leave? \n\n            But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So at that exact turn, we are at (0,9). \n\n            Therefore, we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n            How many actions have been taken to get to that state? \n\n                We started at t0=12: y12=2.\n                We took actions at turn12,13,..., up to turn (t0+H-2) = 12+H-2, and then at turn12+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n                The number of actions: from turn12 to turn12+H-2 -> H-1 actions.\n\n                Then the net movement: 7 upward moves -> so we need 7 actions? then H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\n            But wait, that would mean we are at 9 at the start of turn12+8-1=19? \n\n                Actions: \n                    turn12: action0 -> then at turn13: y13 = 2+Delta0\n                    ...\n                    turn18: action6 (the 7th action) -> then at turn19: y19 = ... = 9.\n\n                So at the start of turn19, we are at 9. And we did actions from turn12 to turn18 (7 actions) -> so H=7.\n\n            The problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so 7 actions: t0=12, t1=13,..., t6=18.\n\n            And we want y_{12+7-1}=y_{18}=9? \n\n            But we are at 9 at turn19, not turn18.\n\n            This is a confusion.\n\n        Let me read the problem carefully:\n\n            \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions\"\n\n            and then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n            So we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\n            How is the state updated? \n\n                At turn t, the player is at y_t, then they choose an action a_t, and then the next state is:\n                    y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta(a_t)\n\n            Therefore, the action a_t is taken at turn t, and it updates the state for the next turn.\n\n            So the state at turn t is y_t.\n\n            We start at turn t1: y_{t1}=2.\n\n            We do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n            The last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\n            But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n            So at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n            Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1, and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta.\n\n            But we don't care about that, because we only require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n            How many actions are in the sequence? H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n            How many state updates? \n                After the first action (at t1): we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta(a_{t1})\n                ...\n                After the last action (at t1+H-1): we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\n            But we don't care about y_{t1+H}.\n\n            We only care about the state at the start of each turn. Specifically, at turn t1+H-1, before we do the last action, we are at 9.\n\n            How do we achieve that? \n\n                We start at turn12: y12=2.\n                We want at turn12+H-1: y_{12+H-1}=9.\n\n                The actions we take at turn12,13,...,12+H-2 will update the state for turns13,14,...,12+H-1.\n\n                The last action in the sequence is at turn12+H-1, but that action is taken when we are already at 9, and it will then update to turn12+H.\n\n            So the actions from turn12 to turn12+H-2: these H-1 actions are responsible for moving from y12=2 to y_{12+H-1}=9.\n\n            Therefore, we need to cover 7 steps in H-1 actions.\n\n            Minimal H-1 = 7 -> H=8.\n\n            Then we do 7 actions (from turn12 to turn12+6=18) to move from 2 to 9, and then at turn19 we are at 9? and then we do an extra action at turn19? \n\n            But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn12+H-1 = 12+8-1=19. \n\n            So we are at y19=9 at the start of turn19, and then we do an action at turn19 (which is the last action in the sequence) and then we move to y20.\n\n            But the goal is achieved at turn19.\n\n            However, the minimal number of actions to move from 2 to 9 is 7 upward moves. So we need 7 upward moves in the first 7 actions (turns12 to 18) and then at turn19 we are at 9. \n\n            But then the last action (at turn19) is not necessary for the movement? \n\n            We can do a S at turn19? \n\n            So the plan: \n                turn12: U\n                turn13: U\n                turn14: U\n                turn15: U\n                turn16: U\n                turn17: U\n                turn18: U   -> then at turn19: y19 = 2+7=9.\n                turn19: S   -> then we are still at 9 at turn20? but we only care about turn19.\n\n            And we are at 9 at turn19.\n\n            So the sequence has 8 actions: 7 U's and one S at the end? \n\n            But we can also do any action at turn19.\n\n            However, we want minimal H (the number of turns in the sequence). H=8.\n\n            But is there a way to be at 9 earlier? \n\n            We require to be at 9 at turn12+H-1. \n\n            The earliest turn to be at 9 is turn12+7: because we need 7 moves. \n\n            So the minimal H-1 = 7 -> minimal H=8.\n\n            Therefore, we output 8 actions.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". \n\n        However, we have to output a sequence of H actions.\n\n        And we are to be at 9 at turn12+H-1.\n\n        So minimal H is 8.\n\n        Let me check with the example: \n            We are at turn12: y=2.\n            We want to be at y=9 at turn19 (which is 12+8-1=19).\n\n            How? \n                turn12: action0: U -> then at turn13: y=3.\n                turn13: action1: U -> turn14: y=4.\n                turn14: action2: U -> turn15: y=5.\n                turn15: action3: U -> turn16: y=6.\n                turn16: action4: U -> turn17: y=7.\n                turn17: action5: U -> turn18: y=8.\n                turn18: action6: U -> turn19: y=9.\n                turn19: action7: ? (we have to do an action, but we are already at 9 at the start of turn19) -> so we can do S.\n\n        So the actions: \n            Turn12: U\n            Turn13: U\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: U\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: S\n\n        But is that valid? \n\n            At turn19: we are at y=9 (which is not a freeway) -> so no collision check. Then we do S, and then at turn20: we are still at 9.\n\n        But the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn19. We are there at the start of turn19, and then we do an action (S) which doesn't cause a collision.\n\n        However, we must check the safety at every freeway we are on during the actions.\n\n        We are on freeways from turn12 to turn18:\n\n            turn12: y=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n            turn13: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n            turn14: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n            turn15: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n            turn16: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n            turn17: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n            turn18: y=8 -> freeway8: at turn18: safe (because unsafe at t19? no, at turn18: we computed safe) -> yes.\n\n        Then turn19: y=9 -> not a freeway, so safe.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But is there a path with H=7? then we would be at 9 at turn12+7-1=18.\n\n            So we require y18=9.\n\n            How? \n                actions at turn12 to turn18-1=17: 7 actions? \n                turn12: action0 -> y13 = 3\n                turn13: action1 -> y14 = 4\n                ...\n                turn17: action6 -> y18 = 9.\n\n            That requires 7 upward moves: from 2 to 9 in 7 moves.\n\n            So the actions: \n                turn12: U\n                turn13: U\n                turn14: U\n                turn15: U\n                turn16: U\n                turn17: U\n                turn18: ? (we don't do any action at turn18 because the sequence has only 7 actions: from turn12 to turn18-1=17)\n\n            But the sequence for H=7: \n                {a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}} -> 6 actions? \n\n            We need 7 actions for 7 moves.\n\n            So with H=7, the actions are from t=0 to 6: turns12 to 17: 7 actions.\n\n            Then at turn18: we are at y18=9.\n\n            So the actions: \n                turn12: U\n                turn13: U\n                turn14: U\n                turn15: U\n                turn16: U\n                turn17: U\n                turn18: not included.\n\n            But the last action is at turn17. And then at turn18 we are at 9.\n\n            So the sequence has 7 actions.\n\n            And we are at 9 at turn18.\n\n            This is what we want.\n\n            Therefore, H=7.\n\n        Let me clarify the indices:\n\n            The sequence: \n                a_{t1+0} = a12\n                a_{t1+1} = a13\n                ...\n                a_{t1+H-1} = a_{12+H-1}\n\n            We want: after these H actions, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n            How the state updates:\n\n                y12 = 2\n                a12: y13 = 2 + Delta(a12)\n                a13: y14 = y13 + Delta(a13)\n                ...\n                a_{12+H-1}: y_{12+H} = y_{12+H-1} + Delta(a_{12+H-1})\n\n            But we require y_{12+H-1}=9.\n\n            So we require that at the start of turn12+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n            How many actions have been taken to get to that state? \n                The actions from a12 to a_{12+H-2} update the state to y_{12+H-1}.\n\n                We need to move from 2 to 9: 7 steps.\n\n                So the number of actions that affect the move is H-1.\n\n                Therefore, we need H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\n            But the requirement is for the state at the start of turn12+H-1 to be 9, not the state after the last action.\n\n            The last action is taken at turn12+H-1, and it uses the state at the start of turn12+H-1 (which is 9) to compute the next state.\n\n            So the movement to 9 is done by the first H-1 actions.\n\n            Therefore, we need H-1>=7.\n\n            Minimal H=8.\n\n        The problem example might be using a different indexing? \n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n            \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\n            and then: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways ... at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\n            So at turn T, we are at y_T. And we are about to do an action a_T.\n\n            We want at some turn T = t1+H-1, we are at y_T=9.\n\n            The actions we have taken are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., T-1 = t1+H-2.\n\n            The last action in the sequence is at turn T = t1+H-1? \n\n            But then we haven't taken an action at that turn yet, so the state at the start of that turn is 9, and then we take an action.\n\n            The sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n            So to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we need to get there by the actions from t1 to t1+H-2.\n\n            Therefore, the number of actions that moved us is H-1.\n\n            We need 7 upward moves, so H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\n        Given the confusion, and the example provided in the problem is not clear, I think we should output the actions for the minimal steps to reach 9, and we are not required to then do an extra action? \n\n        But the problem explicitly says: \"a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\" and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n        So we must be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\n        Therefore, we must do the 7 upward moves in the first 7 actions (at turns12 to 18) and then at the start of turn19 we are at 9, and then we do an action at turn19 (the 8th action).\n\n        So the minimal H is 8.\n\n        But the other interpretation (that the state after an action is the new state) might be that after the action at turn12+H-1, we are at 9. \n\n        Let me see: \n            We want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n            If after the action at turn12+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9, then we require:\n\n                a_{t1+H-1} is such that y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta = 9.\n\n            So if we are at 8 at the start of turn12+H-1, and then we do U, we get to 9.\n\n            Then we would be at 9 at turn12+H.\n\n            But the problem says: at turn12+H-1, we are at 9? not turn12+H.\n\n        The problem: \" such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\n        So it is the state at the beginning of the turn.\n\n        Therefore, we must have moved to 9 by the actions before turn12+H-1.\n\n        So we need 7 actions to move from 2 to 9, and then one extra action at turn12+7=19. So H=8.\n\n        Then the answer is 8 actions.\n\n        But then we can do: \n            actions 0 to 6: U (7 times) to move to 9 by turn19, and then action7: any (S) at turn19.\n\n        So the sequence:\n\n            Turn12: U\n            Turn13: U\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: U\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U   -> this is the 7th action, which is at turn18, and then at the start of turn19: y19=9.\n            Turn19: S   -> then y20=9.\n\n        So the actions include turn19: S.\n\n        And we are at 9 at turn19 ( before we do the S).\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: S\n\n        But note: we could do any action at turn19: U, D, or S. But if we do U, we try to go to 10, but y is in [0,9] -> so it should saturate? the problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. How is that handled? \n\n            \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]\"\n\n            So if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9? or go to 10 then clamped to 9? \n\n            The problem doesn't specify. But to be safe, we can do S.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and do U, then y_{t+1} = min(9, 9+1)=9.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        But we can do S to be explicit.\n\n        Minimal H is 8.\n\n        However, let me see if we can be at 9 earlier? \n\n        Is there a path that gets to 9 at an earlier turn? \n\n        For example, if we move down and then up? but that would take more actions.\n\n        So the fastest is 7 upward moves and then one extra action.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 8 actions.\n\n 32. But in the B however, we might find a path that is shorter if we move through a freeway that becomes safe earlier? \n\n        For example, if we can move up faster by taking a risk? but our path is safe.\n\n        Or if we can move up in 7 actions and be at 9 at turn19, and then we are required to be at 9 at turn19, so we do an action at turn19.\n\n        So it's 8.\n\n 33. Given the above, we output the sequence of 8 actions.\n\n        Turn12: U\n        Turn13: U\n        Turn14: U\n        Turn15: U\n        Turn16: U\n        Turn17: U\n        Turn18: U\n        Turn19: S\n\n 34. But note: at turn18: we are at y=8 at the start of turn18. Then we do U, and then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n        So at turn18: we are on freeway8. We must check freeway8 at turn18: safe.\n\n        Then at turn19: we are at 9, and we do S.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n 35. Therefore, the answer.\n\n 36. However, the problem might intend the state to be updated within the turn? But the problem says: y_{t+1} = ...\n\n        So I think our 8 actions are correct.\n\n 37. Let me double-check the example in the problem of the car on freeway3 at turn12: we are not on freeway3 at turn12, we are on freeway2. So our path never goes through an unsafe freeway.\n\n        turn12: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe.\n        turn13: y=3 (freeway3) -> safe.\n        turn14: y=4 (freeway4) -> safe.\n        turn15: y=5 (freeway5) -> safe.\n        turn16: y=6 (freeway6) -> safe.\n        turn17: y=7 (freeway7) -> safe.\n        turn18: y=8 (freeway8) -> safe.\n        turn19: y=9 -> safe.\n\n        So the only potential danger is freeway5 at turn16? but we are on freeway5 at turn15 (safe) and then move to freeway6 at turn16. We are not on freeway5 at turn16.\n\n        Therefore, the path is safe.\n\n 38. Final answer: 8 actions.\n\n        Turn 12: U\n        Turn 13: U\n        Turn 14: U\n        Turn 15: U\n        Turn 16: U\n        Turn 17: U\n        Turn 18: U\n        Turn 19: S\n\n 39. But wait, can we avoid the last action? \n\n        The problem: we must provide exactly H actions, and H=8.\n\n        We could do Turn19: U (which would leave us at 9) or D (which would go to 8) -> but then we are not at 9 at turn19 (before the action) and then after the action at turn19 we would be at 8 or 10 (then 9) -> but then at turn19 we are at 9 only if we do nothing? \n\n        Actually, at the start of turn19, we are at 9. Then if we do U, we are at 9 (because 9+1>9 -> clamp to 9) -> then at turn20: 9.\n        If we do D, then we go to 8 at turn20.\n\n        But the requirement is only to be at 9 at turn19 (before the action). \n\n        So any action is valid for the last one.\n\n        We can do S to be safe.\n\n 40. Therefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=12, and we are to provide actions for turns 12 to 19.\n\nHowever, the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut is there a path with H=7? \n\n        If we do 7 actions: turns12 to 18.\n\n        Then we want at turn12+7-1=18 to be at 9.\n\n        How? \n            actions: \n                turn12: U -> y13=3\n                turn13: U -> y14=4\n                turn14: U -> y15=5\n                turn15: U -> y16=6\n                turn16: U -> y17=7\n                turn17: U -> y18=8\n                turn18: U -> y19=9\n\n        So at turn18: we are at y18=8, not 9.\n\n        Therefore, we are not at 9 at turn18.\n\n        So we need the extra action to be at 9 at turn19.\n\n        Hence, H=8.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 8. The sequence of actions ensures the player moves upward while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn.\n\n- At turn 12, the player starts at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2), which is safe at turn 12.\n- The player moves up each turn from turn 12 to turn 18, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at the start of turn 19.\n- At turn 19, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway), so no collision check is needed. The action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen to remain at \\(y = 9\\), but any action (\\(U\\), \\(D\\), or \\(S\\)) is valid since the position at the start of turn 19 is already the goal.\n\nThe path is safe because:\n- Freeway 2 at turn 12 is safe.\n- Freeway 3 at turn 13 is safe.\n- Freeway 4 at turn 14 is safe.\n- Freeway 5 at turn 15 is safe.\n- Freeway 6 at turn 16 is safe.\n- Freeway 7 at turn 17 is safe.\n- Freeway 8 at turn 18 is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n```\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 12:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19:  S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nImportant: \n- The player moves at the same time as the cars. \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: The player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. When the player moves, at turn T, if the player is at freeway y_T, then we check the car on that freeway at turn T: if 0 is in the car's span at turn T, then collision.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y (the starting freeway) and then at turn T+1 the player is on y+1. So at the turn when we move, we are on the current freeway until the next turn.\n\nWe are starting at turn 13 at y=3. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car at turn t1 (13) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n- Left-moving (d=left): at time T (>=t1), the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving (d=right): [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation of the car in the state is given at turn 13.\n\nWe have to avoid being on a freeway (1 to 8) when at that turn T, the car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are allowed to move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe are at turn 13, and we want to output actions for turn 13, 14, ... until we reach 9.\n\nLet me list the car configurations for each freeway at turn 13:\n\nFreeway 1: (12,47,left,36) -> left moving, so head=12, tail=47? \nBut note: for left-moving, the head is at the leftmost? Actually the update rule says:\nLeft-moving: span at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is the leftmost? Actually the problem says: \n- Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then it moves left by s per turn. But note that if h < tau, then [h, tau] is from h to tau (which is increasing) but then subtracting s*(T-t1) would move the entire segment left? \n\nHowever, the example for left-moving: at t1, [h, tau] and then at T, [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the entire interval shifts left.\n\nBut in the given state for freeway1: (12,47,left,36). This seems odd because 12 is less than 47? Then the car spans from 12 to 47? That is a length of 36? But then when it moves left, the span becomes [12 - 36*(T-13), 47 - 36*(T-13)]. \n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: (tau, h) and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. In the state, for freeway3: (-36,-47,right,12) -> but note that in the representation for right-moving, the state gives (head, tail) as (h, tau) but then in the update rule it uses [tau, h]? \n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n\nBut in the input, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head]? \n\nLooking at the example for freeway3: \nIt has three cars: \n1. (-36,-47,right,12) -> tail=-47, head=-36? Then at t1, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]?\nBut the update rule for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] -> so at T, the car moves right.\n\nSimilarly, the other car: (48,37,right,12) -> but 48>37, so if head=48 and tail=37, then the span at t1 is [37,48]. Then at T: [37+12*(T-13), 48+12*(T-13)].\n\nBut wait: the representation for the car: (head, tail, direction, speed). The problem does not specify the order of head and tail. However, note that for the left-moving car we have (12,47,left,36) and 12<47, so it's [12,47]. For the right-moving, the example (12,1,right,12) has head=12, tail=1, so the span is [1,12] at t1? Then the update: [1+12*(T-13), 12+12*(T-13)].\n\nBut then the car (-36,-47,right,12): head=-36, tail=-47 -> so tail=-47, head=-36, so the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. Then at T: [-47+12*(T-13), -36+12*(T-13)].\n\nSimilarly, the car (48,37,right,12): head=48, tail=37 -> span at t1: [37,48]. Then at T: [37+12*(T-13), 48+12*(T-13)].\n\nAnd the car (12,1,right,12): head=12, tail=1 -> [1,12] at t1, then [1+12*(T-13), 12+12*(T-13)].\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway and each turn T (>=13) whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: each freeway may have multiple cars. We must avoid 0 being in any car's span at the turn when we are on that freeway.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 13. We are on freeway 3 at turn 13. Then we choose an action for turn 13, which will determine y at turn 14.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\nAt turn T, if we are at freeway k (for k in 1..8), then we require that for every car on freeway k at turn T, 0 is not in the car's span.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting from 13 until we get to 9.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn 13. We must check freeway 3 at turn 13: are we safe?\n\nFreeway 3 at turn 13 has three cars:\n\nCar1: (-36,-47,right,12) -> span at T=13: [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in [-47,-36] -> safe for this car.\nCar2: (48,37,right,12) -> span at T=13: [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> safe.\nCar3: (12,1,right,12) -> span at T=13: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn 13, freeway 3 is safe. So we are safe at the start.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns is at least 6 (if we go up every turn: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves). But we must avoid unsafe freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nWe must check for each freeway and for each turn we plan to be on it, that at that turn, no car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nWe are going to consider moving up as fast as possible, but we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a collision.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 13 onward, and for each freeway, we can precompute the times when it is unsafe (i.e., when there is at least one car on that freeway that has 0 in its span).\n\nLet me define: for a freeway k, the set of turns T (>=13) for which freeway k is unsafe.\n\nWe do this for k=1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (12,47,left,36)\n\nSpan at T: [12 - 36*(T-13), 47 - 36*(T-13)]\n\nWe need 0 in [12 - 36*(T-13), 47 - 36*(T-13)]?\n\nThat is: 12 - 36*(T-13) <= 0 <= 47 - 36*(T-13)\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36*(T-13) <= 0\n=> 12 <= 36*(T-13)\n=> (T-13) >= 12/36 = 1/3 -> T>=13.333... -> so T>=14 (since T integer)\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36*(T-13)\n=> 36*(T-13) <= 47\n=> T-13 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n=> T <= 14.3056 -> T<=14\n\nSo only at T=14: \nAt T=14: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes, because -24<=0<=11.\n\nAt T=13: [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\nAt T=14: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\nAt T=15: [12-36*2,47-36*2] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 is unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1: (12,47,left,36) -> same analysis: unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway3: three cars. We need to check each:\n\nCar1: (-36,-47,right,12): \nSpan at T: [-47+12*(T-13), -36+12*(T-13)]\nWe need 0 in [-47+12*(T-13), -36+12*(T-13)]?\nSo: -47+12*(T-13) <= 0 <= -36+12*(T-13)\n\nFirst: -47+12*(T-13) <=0 -> 12*(T-13)<=47 -> T-13<=47/12≈3.9167 -> T<=16.9167 -> T<=16\nSecond: 0<=-36+12*(T-13) -> 12*(T-13)>=36 -> T-13>=3 -> T>=16\n\nSo T>=16 and T<=16 -> T=16.\n\nCheck T=16: [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? The interval is [-11,0] so 0 is at the boundary. Since the span is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so yes, unsafe.\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,12): span at T: [37+12*(T-13), 48+12*(T-13)]\nWe need 0 in [37+12*(T-13),48+12*(T-13)]?\nSince the numbers are positive and increasing, and at T=13: [37,48] (both positive) and increasing, so 0 is never in this interval.\n\nCar3: (12,1,right,12): [1+12*(T-13),12+12*(T-13)]\nAt T=13: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\nAt T=14: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> positive and increasing -> never includes 0.\n\nSo freeway3: unsafe only at T=16.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? \nThe state says: same cars: (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12) -> so same as freeway3 -> unsafe only at T=16.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway3 -> unsafe only at T=16.\n\nFreeway6: one car: (12,1,right,6) -> so head=12, tail=1, right, speed=6.\nSpan at T: [1+6*(T-13), 12+6*(T-13)]\nWe need 0 in [1+6*(T-13),12+6*(T-13)]?\nSince the interval starts at 1+6*(T-13) which is at least 1 at T=13, and increases, so never includes 0? \nBut wait: T-13 can be negative? No, T>=13. So minimum is at T=13: [1,12] -> positive -> safe.\n\nSo freeway6: always safe? \n\nBut let me check: at T=13: [1,12] -> safe.\nT=14: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> safe.\netc.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6: (12,1,right,6) -> always safe.\n\nFreeway8: two cars: (12,1,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nCar1: (12,1,right,6) -> always safe as above.\n\nCar2: (-36,-47,right,6): span at T: [-47+6*(T-13), -36+6*(T-13)]\nWe need 0 in [-47+6*(T-13), -36+6*(T-13)]?\nSo: -47+6*(T-13) <=0<= -36+6*(T-13)\n\nFirst: -47+6*(T-13)<=0 -> 6*(T-13)<=47 -> T-13<=47/6≈7.833 -> T<=20.833 -> T<=20\nSecond: 0<=-36+6*(T-13) -> 6*(T-13)>=36 -> T-13>=6 -> T>=19\n\nSo T between 19 and 20 inclusive? But T integer -> T=19,20.\n\nCheck T=19: [-47+6*6, -36+6*6] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\nT=20: [-47+6*7, -36+6*7] = [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\nSo freeway8 is unsafe at T=19 and T=20.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at T=14\nFreeway2: unsafe at T=14\nFreeway3: unsafe at T=16\nFreeway4: unsafe at T=16\nFreeway5: unsafe at T=16\nFreeway6: safe always\nFreeway7: safe always\nFreeway8: unsafe at T=19,20\n\nWe are starting at turn 13 at y=3.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves: 6 moves (all U) would take 6 turns: \nTurn13: at y3 -> move U to y4 at turn14\nTurn14: at y4 -> move U to y5 at turn15\nTurn15: at y5 -> move U to y6 at turn16\nTurn16: at y6 -> move U to y7 at turn17\nTurn17: at y7 -> move U to y8 at turn18\nTurn18: at y8 -> move U to y9 at turn19\n\nBut we must check the safety at each step:\n\n- At turn13: we are at freeway3 -> safe (as we saw) -> so we can start.\n\n- Turn14: we are at freeway4? \n  Actually, at turn13 we are at y=3. We choose an action at turn13: if we choose U, then at turn14 we will be at y=4.\n  But at turn14, we are at freeway4? \n  However, note: at turn14, we are at the freeway corresponding to the y at turn14, which is 4.\n\nBut freeway4 is unsafe at T=16? But at T=14, freeway4 is safe? \n\nBut we must check the safety at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn13: at freeway3 -> safe (T=13: freeway3 safe)\nTurn14: at freeway4 -> we need to check freeway4 at T=14: \n  freeway4: same as freeway3 -> unsafe at T=16 only -> so at T=14, freeway4 is safe.\n\nTurn15: at freeway5 -> check T=15: freeway5 unsafe at T=16? At T=15: \n  For freeway5: \n    Car1: (-36,-47,right,12): at T=15: [-47+12*(15-13), -36+12*2] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Car2: (48,37,right,12): [37+24,48+24] = [61,72] -> safe.\n    Car3: (12,1,right,12): [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  So freeway5 is safe at T=15.\n\nTurn16: at freeway6 -> safe (freeway6 is always safe) -> but wait, we are at freeway6 at T=16: \n  freeway6: safe? yes, because we saw no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nBut wait: we are moving from freeway5 to freeway6 at turn16? \nActually, at turn15 we are at freeway5. Then at turn15 we choose U -> at turn16 we are at freeway6.\n\nBut at turn16, freeway6 is safe.\n\nTurn17: at freeway7 -> safe (always safe)\n\nTurn18: at freeway8 -> we need to check freeway8 at T=18: \n  freeway8: \n    Car1: (12,1,right,6): at T=18: [1+6*(18-13),12+6*5]=[1+30,12+30]=[31,42] -> safe.\n    Car2: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+6*5, -36+6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  So at T=18, freeway8 is safe.\n\nTurn19: at freeway9? But note: the freeways are only from 1 to 8. When we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway (since the freeways are for y=1..8). So we are safe at y=9.\n\nBut at turn19, we are moving from freeway8 to freeway9? Actually, at turn18 we are at freeway8. Then at turn18 we choose U -> at turn19 we are at y=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\nSo the plan: \nTurn13: U -> y=4 at turn14\nTurn14: U -> y=5 at turn15\nTurn15: U -> y=6 at turn16\nTurn16: U -> y=7 at turn17\nTurn17: U -> y=8 at turn18\nTurn18: U -> y=9 at turn19\n\nTotal turns: 6 actions (H=6) and we reach at turn19 (which is t1+H-1? Let's see: \nWe start at turn13 (t=0 in the sequence index). We take actions at turn13,14,...,18 (6 actions). Then at turn18 we do the last action (U) and then at the next state (turn19) we are at y=9. So the position at turn19 is (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: we are to reach at turn t1+H-1? \nWe are at turn13: we take H actions: at turn13,14,...,13+H-1. Then the position at turn13+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nSo if we take 6 actions: \nTurn13: action0 -> state at turn14: y4\n...\nTurn18: action5 -> state at turn19: y9.\n\nSo H=6, and we reach at turn13+6-1 = 18? No: \nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1: \nt=0: turn t1+0 = turn13 -> action a13\nt=1: turn14 -> a14\n...\nt=H-1: turn13+H-1 -> a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen the state after the last action is at turn13+H (because after action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1). \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at that turn, and then the state at the next turn (t1+H) is the result. But the problem says we require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nLet me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the position at the turn when we take the last action? But the action changes the state to the next turn.\n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,3). Then we take an action at turn t1, and then the state at the beginning of turn t1+1 is updated.\n\nSo the position at the beginning of turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (13) with y_{13}=3.\n\nWe take action a_{13} at turn13, then y_{14} = y_{13} + delta.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we are at turn t1+H-1 and we are at (0,9). \n\nBut how did we get there? By the actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nThen the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. \n\nSo the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nThen the state at the next turn (t1+H) is the result of the last action? \n\nBut we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read carefully: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, it determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then we set y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThat means that at the turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9? Then why take an action? \n\nAlternatively, we require that after H actions, we have reached 9 by the turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the state at turn t1 is the starting state. Then:\n\n- After 0 actions: we are at turn t1 (13) at y=3 -> not 9.\n- After 1 action: we are at turn t1+1 (14) at y = 3 + Delta(a_{13})\n- ...\n- After k actions: we are at turn t1+k at y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nSo we require that after (H-1) actions, we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, which are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nThen the state at turn t1+H is the result of the last action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. \n\nSo that means that the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are already at 9? Then that action would be either S, D, or U. But if we are at 9 and we move U, we would go to 10, which is not allowed (since y in [0,9])? So we must do S or D? \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. How did we get there? By the previous actions. Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at that state, and then we move to the next state. But we don't care about the next state? \n\nThe problem says: we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we are at that state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the minimal H would be the number of actions we take until we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nIn our plan above, we are at y=9 at turn19 (which is t1+6: 13+6=19). But we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we set H-1 = 6, then H=7? Then we would be at 9 at turn13+7-1=19. \n\nBut how? \n\nWe need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn19. Then we take an action at turn19? But we don't need to? \n\nAlternatively, we can get to 9 at the beginning of turn18? \n\nBut in our plan, we got to 9 at turn19.\n\nBut note: we can also get to 9 earlier? \n\nWe are starting at 3. We need to go to 9: 6 steps. So we can't get there earlier than turn13+6 = turn19? \n\nWait: \nAt turn13: we start at 3.\nAfter one action (turn13): at turn14: 4\nAfter two: turn15:5\nAfter three: turn16:6\nAfter four: turn17:7\nAfter five: turn18:8\nAfter six: turn19:9\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn19.\n\nTherefore, we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 13+H-1 = 19 -> so H-1 = 6 -> H=7.\n\nBut then the sequence of actions would be 7 actions? \n\nBut we only took 6 actions to get to 9 at turn19. \n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (so H actions) and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut if we take 6 actions: \nactions at turn13,14,15,16,17,18 -> then the state at turn13+6-1 = turn18 is the state after 6 actions? \n\nBut after 6 actions, we are at turn19? \n\nLet me define:\n\nLet T0 = t1 = 13.\n\nAt T0: we start at y0 = 3.\n\nWe take action a_{T0} at T0, then at T0+1 we are at y1 = y0 + Delta(a_{T0}).\n\nWe take action a_{T0+1} at T0+1, then at T0+2: y2 = y1 + Delta(a_{T0+1}).\n\n...\n\nWe take action a_{T0+k-1} at T0+k-1, then at T0+k: y_k = y_{k-1} + Delta(a_{T0+k-1}).\n\nWe want at turn T = T0 + (H-1) to be at y=9? \n\nBut the state at turn T0+k is the state after k actions.\n\nSo we want: at turn T0 + (H-1) we are at 9. \n\nThat means we have taken (H-1) actions? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is H actions? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThe action a_{t1+t} is taken at turn t1+t.\n\nThe state y_{t} is at the beginning of turn t.\n\nSo:\n- At the beginning of turn t1: y_{t1}=3.\n- We take action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> then at the beginning of turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta(a_{t1})\n- Similarly, at turn t1+k: we take action a_{t1+k} -> then at turn t1+k+1: y_{t1+k+1} = y_{t1+k} + Delta(a_{t1+k})\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThis means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. How did we get there? \n\nWe took actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nBecause the last action that affected this state was at turn t1+H-2, which set y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Delta(a_{t1+H-2})\n\nSo we have taken H-1 actions: from t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nThen the last action at turn t1+H-1 would set y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\nBut we don't care about y_{t1+H}, we only care that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo the action at turn t1+H-1 can be arbitrary? But we must avoid collision? \n\nHowever, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision. Then we can choose any action? But the problem doesn't require anything beyond turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut to minimize H, we don't want to do an extra action. \n\nSo we want to get to 9 at turn t1+H-1 with the minimal number of actions? \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 at y=3. We want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe number of actions we take to get there is (H-1) because the actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 are the ones that move us to 9 by turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions: the last action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at 9. \n\nWe can choose that last action to be S (stay) to avoid moving.\n\nSo minimal H: we want to minimize H, which is the number of actions (turns we take actions). But we also want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe minimal H: we need at least 6 moves (to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps). So we can be at 9 at turn t1+6? That is, at turn13+6=19.\n\nSo we require t1+H-1 = 19 -> 13+H-1=19 -> H=7.\n\nThen we take 7 actions: at turns13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn19? \n\nHow? \n- We start at turn13: y13=3.\n- We take actions at turn13,14,15,16,17,18: 6 actions to move from 3 to 9 by the beginning of turn19.\n- Then at turn19, we are at 9, and we take an action (the 7th) at turn19. We can choose S (stay).\n\nBut note: at turn19, we are at y=9, which is safe. Then the action at turn19 (S) will leave us at y=9 at turn20, but we don't care.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 = 13+7-1=19, we are at 9. So we are.\n\nSo the sequence: 6 Ups and then one Stay? \n\nBut we must also avoid collisions during the moves.\n\nIn our plan for the first 6 actions (all U) we would be:\n\nTurn13: at freeway3 (safe) -> action U -> to y4 at turn14.\nTurn14: at freeway4 (safe at T=14) -> action U -> to y5 at turn15.\nTurn15: at freeway5 (safe at T=15) -> action U -> to y6 at turn16.\nTurn16: at freeway6 (safe) -> action U -> to y7 at turn17.\nTurn17: at freeway7 (safe) -> action U -> to y8 at turn18.\nTurn18: at freeway8 -> we need to check at T=18: safe as we did earlier -> action U -> to y9 at turn19.\n\nThen at turn19: we are at y9. Then we take action at turn19: we choose S (stay) to not move.\n\nBut wait: the problem says we must avoid collisions on freeways. At turn19, we are at y9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check. Then we are safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut H=7.\n\nBut can we do it in H=6? \n\nThat would require being at 9 at turn t1+6-1=18? So at the beginning of turn18, we are at 9.\n\nHow? \nWe start at turn13 at 3. \nWe need to get to 9 in 5 actions? (because then at turn13+5=18 we are at 9).\n\nBut 9-3=6, so we need 6 moves? So impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut wait: what if we move faster? We can only move one per turn. So 6 moves are required. Then the earliest we can be at 9 is turn19 (by taking 6 moves). And then we have to take one more action at turn19 (which can be S) to satisfy H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nFor example, if we start at turn13 at 3, and we do 6 U's, we are at 9 at turn19. \n\nAlternatively, if we do some D and then U? But that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let me check if the freeways are safe for this plan:\n\nTurn13: at freeway3 (safe at T=13) -> action U -> to y4 at turn14.\nTurn14: at freeway4 (safe at T=14? we said freeway4 unsafe only at T=16 -> safe) -> U to y5 at turn15.\nTurn15: at freeway5 (safe at T=15? we computed: safe) -> U to y6 at turn16.\nTurn16: at freeway6 (safe) -> U to y7 at turn17.\nTurn17: at freeway7 (safe) -> U to y8 at turn18.\nTurn18: at freeway8 (safe at T=18? we checked: at T=18, freeway8: \n  car1: [1+6*(18-13),12+6*5]=[1+30,12+30]=[31,42] -> safe\n  car2: [-47+6*5, -36+6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6] -> safe\n  so safe) -> U to y9 at turn19.\nTurn19: at y9 -> safe, and we do S.\n\nBut note: at turn19, we are at y9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo the sequence is 7 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=6? \n\nIf we do only 6 actions: \nWe take actions at turns13,14,15,16,17,18. Then we require that at turn13+6-1=18, we are at 9.\n\nBut to be at 9 at the beginning of turn18, we must have been moved by 6 steps in 5 actions? \n\nBecause:\nAction at turn13: moves to y at turn14.\n...\nAction at turn17: moves to y at turn18.\n\nSo we have 5 actions (from turn13 to turn17) to move from 3 to 9: 6 steps -> impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut what if we use down moves? For example, to avoid the unsafe times? \n\nBut in our plan, we did not hit any unsafe freeway at the times we were on them. So it's safe.\n\nBut we must verify freeway8 at turn18: we are safe.\n\nHowever, note that freeway8 is unsafe at T=19 and T=20. But at turn18, we are at freeway8 and then we leave it by moving up to 9 at turn19. At turn19, we are not on freeway8, so we don't care about freeway8 at T=19.\n\nBut at turn19, we are at y9 -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut wait: at turn18, we are at freeway8 and we move U to 9. Then at turn19, we are at 9. Then we do S at turn19.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at turn19 (which is t1+H-1=13+7-1=19). And we are.\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the freeways at the critical turns:\n\n- Turn16: we are at freeway6? \n  Our plan: \n    turn13: y3 -> move U -> turn14: y4\n    turn14: y4 -> U -> turn15: y5\n    turn15: y5 -> U -> turn16: y6\n  So at turn16, we are at freeway6 -> which is always safe.\n\nBut what about freeway3 at turn16? We are not on freeway3 at turn16, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and 5 at turn16: we are not on them.\n\nAt turn16, we are only concerned with freeway6 -> safe.\n\nAt turn18: freeway8 safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut what if we try to avoid the last S? \n\nIs there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWe cannot be at 9 earlier than turn19.\n\nAlternatively, we could be at 9 at turn19 without the extra S? \n\nBut the problem requires H actions and the state at turn t1+H-1=19 to be 9. So we must take an action at turn19.\n\nWe could do without the S if we could be at 9 at turn18? But we can't.\n\nAnother idea: what if we do a down move at some point to avoid an unsafe freeway and then up? But in our plan we didn't encounter any unsafe freeway at the times we were on them. So we don't need to.\n\nBut let me check if there is an issue at turn16: \n\nWe are at freeway6 at turn16: safe.\n\nBut note: freeway3,4,5 are unsafe at turn16. But we are not on them.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in H=6 by being at 9 at turn18? \n\nWe start at turn13 at 3. We need to be at 9 at turn18 (which is after 5 actions: from turn13 to turn17). \n\nWe need to move 6 steps in 5 actions: that requires moving more than one per action? Not allowed.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nHence, the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut note: the initial state says the player is at (0,3) at turn13. We are to start with action at turn13.\n\nOne more thing: the freeway8 at turn18 is safe, but what about if we had to stay? \n\nBut we don't: we are moving through.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 13 is 7.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The vertical positions are from 0 to 9, and I start at y=4. The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with constant speed. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe game dynamics say: if I decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 14.\n\nPlayer position: (0,4)\n\nNow, car states:\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. Left-moving cars have span [h, τ] with h > τ I think, since head is larger? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T > t_1, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Since it's moving left, decreasing position.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: span [τ, h] at t_1? No.\n\nLook: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], with ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says span(t_1) = [h, τ], but typically we think of head and tail with head being the front, so for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the left, so h > τ, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h]? It says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? No.\n\nLook carefully:\n\nLeft-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might be [tail, head] since tail is smaller if moving right.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think of the position on the x-axis, but since we only care about x=0, we need when 0 is in the span.\n\nAlso, collision only when 0 is in span at turn T for the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, at turn t_1=14, the cars are given.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so moving left.\n\nAt t_1=14, span = [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But -24 to 11, with h=-24, τ=11? That seems odd because -24 < 11, so [h, τ] with h < τ? But for left-moving, if h is head, it should be larger, but here h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, but the span is from min to max I think.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nIf at t_1, [h, τ] = [-24,11], and h=-24, τ=11, so min is h, max is τ? But then [h, τ] = [-24,11], which is from -24 to 11, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = say for another, [τ, h] and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nFor freeway 1: car (-24,11, left, 36)\n\nSo at t_1, span = [h,τ] = [-24,11], so from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nMoving left with speed 36 per turn? Speed s=36, but what units? Positions, per turn.\n\nThen at time T, span = [-24 - 36*(T-14), 11 - 36*(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-24,11,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] for each.\n\nFor first car: τ=-35, h=-24? It says (-24,-35,right,12), so I think it's (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head is larger? Let's see.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBut for left-moving, head h is the front when moving left, so for left-moving, h should be larger than τ if moving left, but in freeway 1, h=-24, τ=11, -24 < 11, so if moving left, head at -24, tail at 11, that means the car is oriented with head at left, tail at right, so when moving left, it's decreasing, so at t_1, from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head should be on the right.\n\nFor freeway 3, first car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSo head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right.\n\nSince moving right, head at h=-24, tail at τ=-35, so τ < h, tail at left, head at right.\n\nSpan at t_1: for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 +12*(T-14), -24 +12*(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49,right,12) so head=60, tail=49, span [49,60] at t_1, then [49+12ΔT, 60+12ΔT]\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t_1, then [13+12ΔT, 24+12ΔT]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (18,7,right,6) so head=18, tail=7, direction right, so span at t_1: [τ,h] = [7,18], then [7+6ΔT, 18+6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=18, tail=7, span [7,18] at t_1\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6) head=-30, tail=-41, so τ=-41, h=-30, span [τ,h] = [-41,-30] at t_1, then [-41+6ΔT, -30+6ΔT]\n\nNow, I need to find when for each freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway, because that's when collision would occur if I'm on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut since I'm moving vertically, I need to avoid being on a freeway when 0 is covered for that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, I start at y=4 at turn t_1=14.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same), and y must be in 0-9.\n\nGoal: minimize H, the number of turns, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the freeways when they are dangerous.\n\nSince I start at y=4, and need to y=9, I need to go up 5 units, so minimum turns if no obstacles is 5 turns of U, but with obstacles, it might take more if I have to wait or go around.\n\nBut I can only move vertically, not horizontally, so I have to pass through the freeways y=5 to y=8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, which is above freeways, but freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think.\n\nThe grid has vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are at y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nPlayer at (0,y), and when y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Only when on y=1 to 8, I can collide if 0 in car span.\n\nAlso, at y=9, it's safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at turn 14.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path: I need to go from y=4 to y=5, y=6, y=7, y=8, y=9.\n\nBut I can move up, down, or stay, so I might stay or go down to avoid dangerous times.\n\nBut since I need to go up, and time is critical, probably I want to go up when possible, or wait if necessary.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is covered, meaning collision if I'm on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen, for my path, when I am on a freeway y at turn T, it must not be dangerous at that turn.\n\nAlso, since I move, at turn T, I am at position y_T, and I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the car spans at T for freeway y_T.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: one car, left-moving, span at T: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] with h=-24, τ=11, s=36, ΔT = T - 14\n\nSo span = [-24 -36(ΔT), 11 -36(ΔT)]\n\n0 in span when min <= 0 <= max\n\nmin = -24 -36ΔT, max = 11 -36ΔT\n\nSo -24 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 11 -36ΔT\n\nNow, 0 <= 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so ΔT <= 0 since ΔT integer, so ΔT <= 0\n\nAnd -24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36ΔT >= -24 => ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3 ≈ -0.666, so ΔT >= 0 since ΔT integer? ΔT >= ceil(-0.666) = 0? No.\n\nΔT = T - 14, integer.\n\n-24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => divide by -36, reverse: ΔT >= 24/36 * (-1)? Let's careful.\n\n-24 -36ΔT <= 0\n\nAdd 36ΔT to both sides: -24 <= 36ΔT\n\nThen ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT >= 0? -2/3 ≈ -0.666, so ΔT >= ceil(-0.666) but ceil is for upper bound, inequality ΔT >= -2/3, since ΔT integer, ΔT >= 0? No, ΔT can be -1, -2, etc.\n\nFor example, ΔT = -1: min = -24 -36*(-1) = -24 +36 =12, max=11 -36*(-1)=11+36=47, so span [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nΔT =0: min=-24, max=11, -24<=0<=11? 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nΔT=1: min=-24-36= -60, max=11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nΔT= -1: min= -24 +36=12, max=11+36=47, [12,47], 0<12, not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=14, 0 is in span for y=1.\n\nAt T=14, for freeway 1, 0 is covered.\n\nBut at turn T=14, I am at y=4, not on y=1, so for me, when I am on y=1 at some turn, I need to avoid when it's dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nFrom above, for y=1, only at T=14, 0 is in span, for other T, not.\n\nΔT=0 only, so only at T=14.\n\nBut T=14 is current turn, and I'm at y=4, not on y=1.\n\nFor future turns, T>14, ΔT>0, min and max both decrease, min <= max only if -24-36ΔT <= 11-36ΔT, which is -24<=11, true, but for ΔT>=1, min <= -60 < -25 <= max, but 0 > max since max=11-36ΔT <=11-36=-25<0 for ΔT>=1, so 0 not in span.\n\nFor ΔT<0, min and max increase, but at ΔT=-1, min=12>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=14, y=1 is dangerous, but since I'm not on it now, and for future, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: same as y=1, car (-24,11,left,36), so same thing, only dangerous at T=14.\n\nNow freeway y=3: three cars, all right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) so at t_1, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24]? Earlier: head=-24, tail=-35, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nThen at T, [ -35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49,right,12) span at t_1 [49,60], at T [49+12ΔT, 60+12ΔT]\n\n0 in if 49+12ΔT <= 0 <= 60+12ΔT, but 49+12ΔT >=49 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= left end, not satisfied since left end >0. Similarly for other ΔT, always positive, so never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,12) span at t_1 [13,24], at T [13+12ΔT,24+12ΔT], similarly always positive for ΔT>=0, or for ΔT negative, but at ΔT=-1, [13-12,24-12]=[1,12], 0 not in, etc., so never covers 0.\n\nNow first car: [ -35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 in if -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nLeft: -35 +12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT <=2 and ΔT >=2, so ΔT=2\n\nThus at ΔT=2, T=14+2=16, span: min= -35+12*2= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included since <= max, max=0.\n\nSimilarly, at other times not.\n\nFor example ΔT=1: min=-35+12= -23, max=-24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=16, for y=3, first car covers 0.\n\nSecond and third cars never cover 0, as spans are always positive.\n\nSimilarly for y=4: same as y=3, so only dangerous at T=16.\n\ny=5: same as y=3, dangerous only at T=16.\n\nNow y=6: one car (18,7,right,6)\n\nSpan at t_1: for right-moving, [τ,h] = [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7 +6ΔT, 18 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in if 7+6ΔT <=0 <=18+6ΔT\n\nBut 7+6ΔT >=7>0 for ΔT>=0, so left end >0, 0 not <= left end? Inequality: min <= 0 <= max\n\nmin=7+6ΔT >0, so 0 < min, not <= min unless min<=0, which never for ΔT>=0. For ΔT<0, min could be smaller.\n\nΔT integer.\n\n7+6ΔT <=0 only if 6ΔT <= -7, ΔT <= -7/6 ≈ -1.166, so ΔT <= -2\n\nAnd 0 <=18+6ΔT => 6ΔT >= -18 => ΔT >= -3\n\nSo for ΔT <= -2 and ΔT >= -3\n\nΔT >= -3 and ΔT <= -2\n\nΔT= -3: min=7+6*(-3)=7-18=-11, max=18-18=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT= -2: min=7+6*(-2)=7-12=-5, max=18-12=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT= -1: min=7-6=1, max=18-6=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=0: [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=1: [13,24], etc.\n\nSo at ΔT= -3 and ΔT= -2, i.e., T=14 + (-3)=11, or T=14 + (-2)=12\n\nBut T=11 and T=12 are past turns? Current turn is 14, so T=11 and 12 are before t_1.\n\nSince we are at turn 14, and we care about future turns T>=14, so for T>=14, ΔT>=0, min=7+6ΔT >=7>0, so 0 not in span, so for y=6, no danger at T>=14.\n\nSimilarly for y=7: same car, (18,7,right,6), so same, no danger for T>=14.\n\nNow y=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6), same as above, no danger for T>=14.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6), head=-30, tail=-41, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-41,-30] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [ -41 +6ΔT, -30 +6ΔT ]\n\n0 in if -41 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -30 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -41 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=41 => ΔT <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so ΔT <=6\n\nRight: 0 <= -30 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=30 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo ΔT >=5 and ΔT <=6\n\nThus for ΔT=5 and ΔT=6\n\nT=14+5=19 and T=14+6=20\n\nAt T=19: min= -41 +6*5= -41+30= -11, max= -30+30=0, so [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt T=20: min= -41 +36= -5? 6*6=36, min=-41+36=-5, max=-30+36=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=21: min=-41+42=1, max=-30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=8, dangerous at T=19 and T=20.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous only at T=14\n\n- y=2: dangerous only at T=14\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=16\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=16\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=16\n\n- y=6: no danger for T>=14\n\n- y=7: no danger for T>=14\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=19 and T=20\n\ny=6 and y=7 are always safe for T>=14.\n\nI start at y=4 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, y=4, is it dangerous? Freeway y=4 is dangerous at T=16, not at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, for y=4, is 0 covered? From above, for y=4, only dangerous at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, at T=14, I am on y=4, and y=4 has cars, but at T=14, let's check if 0 is covered for y=4.\n\nFor y=4, same as y=3, cars: at T=14, first car span [-35,-24], which is negative, 0 not in. Second [49,60], 0 not. Third [13,24], 0 not. So at T=14, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 dangerous at T=14, but I'm not on them.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nI start at T=14, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal vertical move is 5 steps up, but I may need to avoid dangerous times on the freeways I cross.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I can cross them anytime.\n\ny=5 is dangerous only at T=16, so I should not be on y=5 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 dangerous at T=16, y=3 at T=16, but I start at y=4, so I need to leave y=4 before T=16 or not be on it at T=16.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=19 and 20.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to go from y=4 to y=5, then y=6, y=7, y=8, y=9.\n\nEach move up takes one turn, but I can stay or go down to waste time.\n\nSince I want minimal turns, I should go up as much as possible, except when I would be on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\nNow, at T=14, I am at y=4, which is safe now.\n\nI take action at T=14 to go to next position.\n\nAfter action, at T=15, I am at new y.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nStart: T=14, y=14 = 4? Better to use time.\n\nTurn T, position y_T.\n\nT=14, y=4.\n\nI choose action a_14, which sets y_15.\n\nThen at T=15, I am at y_15, choose a_15, sets y_16, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T=H, with y_H=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so after H-1 actions, I reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have moved H times, so at turn t_1 + H, I am at some position.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, at turn t_1 + k +1, y_{t_1 + k +1} = y_{t_1 + k} + Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nI reach (0,9) when for some turn, y_T =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9? Let's see the turn index.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at y.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, I am at new y.\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1+1}, at turn t_1+2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t_1 + k.\n\nI reach y=9 at turn T, for some T >= t_1.\n\nThe number of turns from start: if I reach at turn t_1 + K, then I have used K actions? Actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + K -1} for K actions, reaching at turn t_1 + K.\n\nTurn t_1: before any action, position given.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + m}, at turn t_1 + m +1, position y_{t_1 + m +1}\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn, say T.\n\nThen the number of actions is T - t_1.\n\nSince from turn t_1 to turn T, there are (T - t_1) actions taken, at times t_1 to T-1.\n\nTurn indices: turns t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, ..., up to T.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter action at turn t_1, position at turn t_1+1 is set.\n\nSo the position at turn t_1 + k is after k actions.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, I need actions from t_1 to T-1.\n\nThe number of actions H = T - t_1.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions to reach.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nStart at T=14, y=4.\n\ny=4 is safe at T=14, but dangerous at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 dangerous at T=16.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=19 and 20.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some point to go to y=9, but I should avoid T=19 and 20 on y=8.\n\nAlso, y=9 is safe.\n\nSince I need to go up, and y=6 and y=7 safe, I can go directly if possible.\n\nBut I have to cross y=5 and y=8, which have dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's see when I can be on y=5.\n\ny=5 dangerous only at T=16, so I should not be on y=5 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 dangerous at T=16, so at T=16, I should not be on y=4 or y=5.\n\nAlso, y=3 dangerous at T=16, but I start from y=4, going up, so I won't go to y=3, I assume, since I need to go to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 dangerous only at T=14, which is past, so safe for future.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nStart T=14, y=4.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at T=15? At T=14, I take action, which affects position at T=15.\n\nAt T=14, I am at y=4.\n\nI take a_14 = U, then y_15 = y_14 +1 =5\n\nThen at T=15, I am at y=5.\n\nThen I can take a_15 = U, to y_16=6\n\nBut at T=16, if I am on y=5, it is dangerous, since y=5 dangerous at T=16.\n\nAt T=15, I am at y=5, then I take action a_15, which sets y_16.\n\nIf I take U at T=15, then y_16 = y_15 +1 =5+1=6\n\nThen at turn T=16, I am at y=6.\n\nAt T=16, I am on y=6, which is safe, since y=6 no danger.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut at T=15, I was on y=5, and T=15, is y=5 dangerous at T=15?\n\nFrom above, y=5 dangerous only at T=16, not at T=15.\n\nFor y=5, same as y=4, dangerous only at T=16.\n\nAt T=15, for y=5, ΔT = T-14 =1, for the cars.\n\nFreeway y=5: cars same as y=3.\n\nAt T=15, ΔT=1, first car span: [ -35 +12*1, -24 +12*1] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], no\n\nThird: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], no\n\nSo safe at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, ΔT=2, first car: [-35+24, -24+24]=[-11,0], 0 in, dangerous.\n\nSo back to the path.\n\nIf at T=14, I go U to y=5 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=15, I take U to go to y=6 at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=7 at T=17, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at T=18.\n\nNow at T=18, I am at y=8.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=19 and 20, but not at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, for y=8, ΔT= T-14=4\n\nCars: first car (18,7,right,6) but for y=8, at T=18, span: min=7+6*4=7+24=31, max=18+24=42? [7+6ΔT,18+6ΔT] for the first car, but at ΔT=4, [7+24,18+24]=[31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6), span at T: min=-41+6*4=-41+24=-17, max=-30+24=-6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at T=18.\n\nThen at T=18, I am at y=8, I take U to go to y=9 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe, and I reached y=9.\n\nBut is that at T=19?\n\nLet's see the turns:\n\nT=14: start y=4\n\na_14 = U → y_15 =5\n\nT=15: y=5, a_15 = U → y_16=6\n\nT=16: y=6, a_16 = U → y_17=7\n\nT=17: y=7, a_17 = U → y_18=8\n\nT=18: y=8, a_18 = U → y_19=9\n\nAt T=19, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, number of actions: from T=14 to T=18, actions at 14,15,16,17,18, that's 5 actions.\n\nH = number of turns from start? After 5 actions, at turn 19, which is t_1 + 5, since t_1=14, 14+5=19.\n\nH such that at turn t_1 + H -1? t_1 + H -1 =14 + H -1.\n\nAt turn 19, y=9, so 14 + H -1 =19? Then 13 + H =19, H=6? I think I confused.\n\nDefine H: the minimal number of turns such that at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the problem: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1, and position at turn t_1 + H -1 +1? After action at time t, position at time t+1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + k, position at t_1 + k +1.\n\nThe last action is at t_1 + H -1, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nWe want that position to be (0,9).\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H, y =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn my path, at turn 19, y=9, and t_1=14, so t_1 + H =19, so H=5.\n\nActions at T=14,15,16,17,18: all U.\n\nNow, in this path, did I avoid collisions?\n\nAt each turn, when I was on a freeway:\n\nT=15: y=5, safe as above.\n\nT=16: y=6, safe.\n\nT=17: y=7, safe.\n\nT=18: y=8, safe.\n\nAt T=19, y=9, not freeway.\n\nBut at T=16, I was on y=6, which is fine.\n\nIs there any problem? y=8 at T=18 is safe, as calculated.\n\nBut y=8 is dangerous at T=19 and 20, but at T=18, I was on y=8, then I moved to y=9 at T=19, so at T=19, I am on y=9, not on y=8.\n\nCollision is only if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T and 0 in span for that freeway at T.\n\nAt T=19, if I were on y=8, it would be dangerous, but I am on y=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=20.\n\nIn this path, I reached in 5 turns.\n\nBut is it minimal? 5 turns to go from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps up, seems minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I was in danger.\n\nT=15: y=5, freeway, at T=15, not dangerous.\n\nT=16: y=6, safe.\n\nT=17: y=7, safe.\n\nT=18: y=8, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=5 dangerous at T=16, but in this path, at T=16 I was on y=6, not y=5.\n\nAt T=15 I was on y=5, but T=15 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 dangerous at T=16, but I was not on y=4 at T=16.\n\nIn this path, no issue.\n\nBut what about y=8? I was on it at T=18, safe, and moved away before T=19.\n\nNow, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 moves up, so H=5 should be minimal.\n\nBut can I reach faster? Suppose I start by staying or something, but that would take more turns, so no.\n\nOr go down, but that would be worse.\n\nSo H=5 seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8.\n\nAt T=18, y=8, cars:\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6), at T=18, ΔT=4, span [7+24,18+24]=[31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6), at T=18, ΔT=4, span [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at T=19, I am on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at T=19, if I were on y=8, it would be dangerous, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought y=1 and y=2 dangerous at T=14, but I wasn't on them.\n\nNow, another thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am not on the new freeway yet.\n\nFor example, when I go from y=5 to y=6 at T=15, at T=15 I am on y=5, then after action U, at T=16 I am on y=6.\n\nAt T=15, I am on y=5, which is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do at T=19.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in less than 5 turns? Impossible, since 5 steps needed.\n\ny=4 to y=9, difference 5, each U move increases by 1, so minimum 5 U actions.\n\nIf I do S or D, it takes more turns.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions: all U.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{15} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +4: a_{18} = U\n\nt_1=14, so turns: 14,15,16,17,18.\n\nActions at these turns.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nWith H=5, t=0,1,2,3,4\n\nSo a_{14+0} = a_14 = U\n\na_{14+1} = a_15 = U\n\na_{14+2} = a_16 = U\n\na_{14+3} = a_17 = U\n\na_{14+4} = a_18 = U\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1? t_1 + H -1 =14 +5 -1=18, action at 18, and after that at turn 19, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut is there any reason I need to do something else?\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if at some point I have to wait because of y=8.\n\nBut in this case, I reached before T=19, so no need.\n\nSuppose I go slower.\n\nFor example, if at T=14 I stay, y=4, then at T=15 y=4, but y=4 dangerous at T=16, so if I stay at T=15, then at T=16 I am on y=4, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo I have to leave y=4 before T=16.\n\nSimilarly for y=5.\n\nIn my path, I left y=4 at T=14 to y=5 at T=15.\n\nThen left y=5 at T=15 to y=6 at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, not on y=4 or y=5, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=18, before T=19.\n\nNow, what if I go faster? I can't, since I need to move step by step.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1,-1,0.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm y=8 at T=18.\n\nFreeway y=8: cars as above.\n\nAt T=18, safe.\n\nAnd I move to y=9 at T=19.\n\nNow, but the second car on y=8: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAt T=18, ΔT=4, span [-41+24, -30+24]=[-17,-6], not covering 0.\n\nAt T=19, ΔT=5, [-41+30, -30+30]=[-11,0], covers 0, dangerous.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in the car list, for y=8, there is another car: (18,7,right,6), which at T=19 would be [7+30,18+30]=[37,48], not covering 0, so only the second car is dangerous at T=19 and 20.\n\nBut irrelevant.\n\nSo I think the path is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5, actions all U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=14,\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut in the sequence, turn t_1 +1, etc., but since t_1 given, we write the turns.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSo I think it's clear.\n\nBut is there a mistake?\n\nAnother thing: when I go to y=9, it's not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nBut at the point, when I move to y=9, at the turn I move, I am not on y=9 yet.\n\nFor example, at T=18, I am on y=8, take U, then at T=19, I am on y=9.\n\nAt T=18, I am on y=8, which is safe, as above.\n\nNo collision.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach earlier, but I start at y=4, need to y=9, 5 moves, cannot earlier.\n\nUnless I start at higher, but no.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 6 and 7, which are safe, and I passed through.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions at turn 16: U, from y=6 to y=7, at T=16 I am on y=6, which is fine.\n\nThen to y=7 at T=17.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo I think no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and I have H=5.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to box the sequence.\n\nSo for the box:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 14: U \\\\  \nTurn 15: U \\\\  \nTurn 16: U \\\\  \nTurn 17: U \\\\  \nTurn 18: U  \n}\n\nBut the turn is t_1, which is 14, so it should be Turn 14: U, etc.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps write as Turn 14: U, but since t_1 given, it should be clear.\n\nIn the box, I think it's acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 16, when I am on y=6, is it safe? Yes.\n\nBut freeway y=6 has car, but at T=16, for y=6, ΔT=2, span [7+12,18+12]=[19,30], not covering 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nSo this should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn 14 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs only if, at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and the position x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n### Analysis of Dangerous Times for Freeways\n- **Freeway y=1**: Dangerous only at T=14. Safe for T > 14.\n- **Freeway y=2**: Dangerous only at T=14. Safe for T > 14.\n- **Freeway y=3**: Dangerous at T=16. Safe otherwise for T ≥ 14.\n- **Freeway y=4**: Dangerous at T=16. Safe otherwise for T ≥ 14.\n- **Freeway y=5**: Dangerous at T=16. Safe otherwise for T ≥ 14.\n- **Freeway y=6**: No danger for T ≥ 14 (always safe).\n- **Freeway y=7**: No danger for T ≥ 14 (always safe).\n- **Freeway y=8**: Dangerous at T=19 and T=20. Safe otherwise for T ≥ 14.\n\nThe player starts at y=4 at T=14, which is safe (not dangerous at T=14 for y=4). The goal is y=9, which has no cars and is always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach y=9 in Minimal Turns\n- From y=4 to y=9 requires a minimum of 5 upward moves (U actions), as each U increases y by 1.\n- The dangerous times must be avoided:\n  - y=4 and y=5 are dangerous at T=16, so the player must not be on these freeways at T=16.\n  - y=8 is dangerous at T=19 and T=20, so the player must not be on y=8 at these turns.\n- y=6 and y=7 are always safe and can be crossed at any time.\n\nThe optimal sequence is to move up (U) at every turn, starting from T=14:\n- At T=14, y=4 (safe). Action U → y=5 at T=15.\n- At T=15, y=5 (safe at T=15). Action U → y=6 at T=16.\n- At T=16, y=6 (safe). Action U → y=7 at T=17.\n- At T=17, y=7 (safe). Action U → y=8 at T=18.\n- At T=18, y=8 (safe at T=18). Action U → y=9 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, the player reaches y=9, which is safe. This sequence uses 5 actions (H=5) and avoids all collisions:\n- T=15: y=5 is safe (not dangerous at T=15).\n- T=16: y=6 is safe.\n- T=17: y=7 is safe.\n- T=18: y=8 is safe (dangerous only at T=19 and T=20, but player moves to y=9 at T=19).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as moving down (D) or staying (S) would increase the number of turns without benefit, and 5 upward moves are required to cover the vertical distance.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- Turn 14: U (move to y=5 at T=15)\n- Turn 15: U (move to y=6 at T=16)\n- Turn 16: U (move to y=7 at T=17)\n- Turn 17: U (move to y=8 at T=18)\n- Turn 18: U (move to y=9 at T=19)\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns H is 5, with the sequence above.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 5) at turn t_1 = 15. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The span is the interval covered by the car.\n\nImportant note: when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, you are only considered on y_T at turn T, not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. Therefore, you only check for collisions on the row you're currently on at each turn.\n\nCars move horizontally. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases; for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1 = 15.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, left-moving, head at -60, tail at -25, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, at time t, span is [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: at turn T > t_1, span is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for left-moving, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). For left-moving, since it's moving left, head should be on the right, tail on left? I think I need to interpret head and tail.\n\nIn the span description, for left-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail at τ\", and span is [h, τ] at t_1, then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], I think? It says: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? No.\n\nLook: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state table, for right-moving, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nI think \"head\" and \"tail\" might be consistent, but for direction, it defines the span.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ] with h and τ, and since it's left-moving, h should be the right end, τ the left end? But [h, τ] implies h and τ, with h possibly less or more.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: head -60, tail -25. Since -60 < -25, so [h, τ] = [-60, -25], which is from -60 to -25, so left end -60, right end -25? But it's left-moving, meaning it moves to decreasing x, so at later time, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: one car head -12, tail -23? Head -12, tail -23, but -12 > -23, so if span is [τ, h] for right-moving, but it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), and for direction right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h].\n\nFor freeway 3, first car: head -12, tail -23, direction right. So τ = -23, h = -12, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12], which is from -23 to -12.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nFor left-moving, like freeway 1: head -60, tail -25, direction left, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25].\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that exact turn.\n\nPlayer position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always, we care about when x=0 is covered by a car's span on the row y at time t.\n\nSince player is always at x=0, collision if at turn T, y_T = k, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nNow, we start at t_1=15, y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is the top row, but y=9 has no cars since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once we reach y=9, no more collisions, but we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, so safe once there.\n\nBut we need to move from y=5 to y=9, so we need to pass through y=6,7,8 potentially, but we can move vertically directly.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so to go from 5 to 9, we need at least 4 moves up, but we can stay or go down, but that would take more turns, so minimal turns should be with mostly up moves, but we might need to avoid collisions by waiting or moving down temporarily.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway and each future turn, when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, we can find the times when 0 is covered for each car.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t_1 = T - 15, so at time T, for a car, the span depends on Δt.\n\nFor a left-moving car: span at T is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 is between h - s Δt and τ - s Δt inclusive.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one left-moving car, h=-60, τ=-25, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [ -60 - 36 Δt, -25 - 36 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if min( -60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt ) ≤ 0 ≤ max( -60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt )\n\nSince -60 -36Δt < -25 -36Δt, so min is left, max is right.\n\nSo -60 -36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36Δt\n\nSolve inequality:\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36Δt ≤ 0 => -36Δt ≤ 60 => Δt ≥ -60/36? No:\n\n-60 -36Δt ≤ 0 => -36Δt ≤ 60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36Δt ≥ -60 => Δt ≥ -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, but since Δt ≥0, this is always true for Δt ≥0.\n\n-60 -36Δt ≤ 0 => -36Δt ≤ 60 => divide by -36, reverse: Δt ≥ 60/36? Let's carefully.\n\n-60 -36Δt ≤ 0\n\nAdd 36Δt to both sides: -60 ≤ 36Δt\n\nThen Δt ≥ -60/36 = -5/3, but Δt = T-15 ≥0, so for all Δt ≥0, this is true.\n\nNow second inequality: 0 ≤ -25 -36Δt\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36Δt\n\nThen 25 +36Δt ≤ 0? No:\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36Δt\n\nAdd 25 to both sides: 25 ≤ -36Δt\n\nThen -36Δt ≥ 25? Multiply both sides by -1, reverse: 36Δt ≤ -25\n\nBut Δt ≥0, 36Δt ≥0, -25<0, so 36Δt ≤ -25 is impossible.\n\nI think I confused.\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36Δt\n\nSince -25 -36Δt is negative for all Δt ≥0, because -25 <0 and -36Δt ≤0, so -25 -36Δt <0, so 0 ≤ negative number is false.\n\nThus, for all Δt ≥0, 0 ≤ -25 -36Δt is false.\n\nTherefore, 0 is never in the span for this car? But let's see the span.\n\nSpan is [ -60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt ], both ends negative for all t, since at Δt=0, [-60,-25], all negative, and as Δt increases, it becomes more negative, so 0 is never in this interval because 0 > -25 -36Δt for all Δt.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, span [-60,-25], 0 not in it. At any time, left end is more negative, right end less negative but still negative, so 0 always to the right of the span, not inside.\n\nSo for freeway 1, no collision possible at any time, because the car is always left of x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-60,-25,left,36), so same thing, no collision ever.\n\nNow freeway 3: has three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head h=-12, tail τ=-23, direction right, s=12\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 12 Δt, -12 + 12 Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-23 +12Δt, -12 +12Δt]\n\nSo min and max: since s>0, -23+12Δt < -12+12Δt, so [left, right] with left increasing.\n\n0 in interval if -23 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12Δt\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst: -23 +12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 23 => Δt ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.9167\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 +12Δt => 12 ≤ 12Δt => Δt ≥ 1\n\nSo for Δt between 1 and 23/12 ≈1.9167, i.e., at turns where T-15 =1 or 2? Δt=1: T=16, Δt=2: T=17, but 23/12=1.9167, so at Δt=1, T=16, and Δt=2, T=17, but at Δt=2, let's check.\n\nΔt=1: span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ 0 is true, so yes, 0 in [-11,0] at T=16.\n\nAt Δt=2: span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 1 ≤ 0 ≤12? 0 <1, not ≥1, so 0 not in [1,12], so only at Δt=1, T=16.\n\nΔt=1: T=16, span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nΔt=2: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=1.9167 would be if, but turns are integer, so only at T=16 for this car.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: head -48, tail -59, direction right, s=12\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-59, so for right-moving, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 +12 Δt, -48 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in if -59 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12Δt\n\nFirst: -59 +12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.9167\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +12Δt => 48 ≤ 12Δt => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo Δt from 4 to 4.9167, so turns T=15+4=19 to T=15+4=19? Δt=4: T=19, Δt=5: T=20\n\nAt Δt=4: span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=5: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=19.\n\nThird car on freeway 3: head 36, tail 25, direction right, s=12\n\nτ=25, h=36? Head h=36, tail τ=25, so [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [25 +12 Δt, 36 +12 Δt]\n\nNow, 25 +12Δt >0 for all Δt≥0, so 0 ≤ 25+12Δt is true, but 0 ≤ left end? 0 in [left, right] requires left ≤ 0 ≤ right.\n\nLeft = 25+12Δt ≥25>0, so left >0, so 0 < left, not ≤ left, so 0 not in interval since interval is [positive, more positive].\n\nSo this car never has 0 in span.\n\nThus for freeway 3, collisions possible at T=16 (from first car) and T=19 (from second car).\n\nAt T=16, from first car, and T=19 from second car.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12) — same as freeway 3.\n\nIn table: freeway 4 has same cars as freeway 3: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nSo freeways 3,4,5 all have identical car setups, so collisions at T=16 and T=19 for each.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, (24,13,right,6)\n\nHead h=24, tail τ=13, direction right, s=6\n\nSpan: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [13 + 6 Δt, 24 + 6 Δt]\n\nLeft =13+6Δt ≥13>0, so 0 not in [13+6Δt, 24+6Δt] for any Δt.\n\nSo no collision on freeway 6 ever.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, (24,13,right,6), so no collision.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars, (24,13,right,6) and (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6), same as above, no collision.\n\nSecond car: head -24, tail -35, direction right, s=6\n\nτ=-35, h=-24, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-35 + 6 Δt, -24 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in if -35 +6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -35 +6Δt ≤ 0 => 6Δt ≤ 35 => Δt ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +6Δt => 24 ≤ 6Δt => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo Δt from 4 to 5.833, so T=15+4=19 to T=15+5=20? Δt=4: T=19, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], -5 ≤0≤6, yes.\n\nΔt=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=19 and T=20, collision on freeway 8 from this car.\n\nNow summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: no collision ever\n\n- y=2: no collision ever\n\n- y=3: collision at T=16 and T=19\n\n- y=4: collision at T=16 and T=19\n\n- y=5: collision at T=16 and T=19\n\n- y=6: no collision\n\n- y=7: no collision\n\n- y=8: collision at T=19 and T=20\n\nPlayer starts at t=15, y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 with minimal turns.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=5, minimum 4 up moves if we go directly, but we need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times when collision happens.\n\nSpecifically, for row y=5, which we are on at t=15, but at t=15, is there collision?\n\nAt t=15, Δt=0.\n\nFor y=5, cars: at t=15, the spans.\n\nFor example, first car on y=5: (-12,-23,right,12), span at t=15: [τ, h] = [-23,-12], 0 not in [-23,-12], since -23 < -12 <0? -12 is negative, so 0 > -12, not in interval. Similarly, other cars at t=15: second car [-59,-48], 0 not in, third [25,36] not. So at t=15, no collision on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows at t=15, we can check, but player is on y=5 now, and we are about to choose action for turn t=15 to go to t=16.\n\nThe sequence starts from turn t_1=15.\n\nWe need to choose a_t for t=15, t=16, etc., until we reach y=9.\n\nAt each turn, after action, we move to new position, and we must not be on a row where collision occurs at that turn.\n\nSince we are at (0,5) at turn 15, and we choose action a_{15}, which determines y_{16}.\n\nThen at turn 16, we are at y_{16}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn for the row we are on at that turn.\n\nNow, from above, collision times:\n\n- On y=3,4,5: unsafe at T=16 and T=19\n\n- On y=8: unsafe at T=19 and T=20\n\n- Other rows: always safe\n\ny=1,2,6,7 always safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=15, y=5.\n\nAt t=15, we are on y=5, which is safe at t=15, as we saw.\n\nNow we need to move to higher y.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on y=3,4,5 at t=16 or t=19, and on y=8 at t=19 or t=20.\n\nt=16 is the next turn.\n\nIf we stay on y=5 at t=16, it will be unsafe, since collision at t=16 for y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if we move to y=4 or y=6, etc.\n\nLet's list possible actions.\n\nAt turn t=15 (current turn), we choose a_{15}, which determines y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy.\n\ny_{15} =5.\n\nIf a_{15} = U, y_{16} =6\n\nIf a_{15} = D, y_{16} =4\n\nIf a_{15} = S, y_{16} =5\n\nNow, at turn t=16, we will be on y_{16}, and we need to avoid collision.\n\nIf y_{16} =5, unsafe because t=16 collision on y=5.\n\nIf y_{16} =4, y=4 also unsafe at t=16.\n\nIf y_{16} =6, y=6 is always safe, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe choice at t=15 is to go up to y=6, so a_{15} = U, then at t=16, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, at t=16, we are on y=6.\n\ny=6 is always safe, so we can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut we want to go to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, y=6.\n\nWe choose a_{16} for turn 16, which determines y_{17}.\n\nPossible: U to y=7, D to y=5, S to y=6.\n\ny=7 is always safe.\n\ny=5 at t=17: is y=5 unsafe at t=17?\n\nEarlier, for y=5, collision only at t=16 and t=19.\n\nt=17 is not a collision time for y=5, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nIf we go up to y=7, safe.\n\nOr stay, or down, but down might not be efficient.\n\nSince y=7 is safe, we can go up.\n\nBut we have to worry about future times, especially t=19 and t=20.\n\nFirst, let's assume we go up directly.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=16, if we go U, to y=7 at t=17.\n\nAt t=17, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen from y=7, we can go U to y=8 at t=18.\n\nNow, at t=18, on y=8.\n\ny=8 has collision at t=19 and t=20, but t=18 is not listed, so at t=18, is it safe?\n\nFor y=8, collision at T=19 and T=20.\n\nAt T=18, Δt =18-15=3.\n\nFor the car on y=8: second car, span at T: [ -35 +6 Δt, -24 +6 Δt]\n\nAt Δt=3, T=18: span [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17, -6], all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other car no issue.\n\nSo at t=18, on y=8, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn t=18, we are on y=8.\n\nWe choose a_{18}, which determines y_{19}.\n\nIf we go U, to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, we would be on y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=18, we are on y=8.\n\nAfter action a_{18}, y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy.\n\nIf a_{18} = U, then y_{19} =9.\n\nThen at turn t=19, we are on y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9), so if we reach y=9 at t=19, we are done? Turn count.\n\nSequence: from t=15 to t=19, that's 4 turns? Let's list the turns.\n\nStart: turn t=15, position (0,5)\n\nAfter action a_{15}, at turn t=16, position (0, y_{16})\n\nSimilarly, at turn t=17, (0, y_{17}), and so on.\n\nWe need to have y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nIn the sequence, when we perform the action, we move to the next position at the next turn.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at turn T, that means at turn T, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, from above, if we do:\n\nt=15: a_{15} = U, then at t=16, y=6\n\nt=16: a_{16} = U, then at t=17, y=7\n\nt=17: a_{17} = U, then at t=18, y=8\n\nt=18: a_{18} = U, then at t=19, y=9\n\nAt t=19, we are at (0,9), and since y=9 safe, we have reached.\n\nBut is this safe? We need to check for each turn if we are safe.\n\nAt t=15: on y=5, which we said safe at t=15.\n\nAt t=16: on y=6, which is always safe.\n\nAt t=17: on y=7, always safe.\n\nAt t=18: on y=8, we checked at t=18 safe.\n\nAt t=19: on y=9, safe.\n\nBut we have potential issues at t=19 for other rows, but we are not on them.\n\nIn this path, we were never on y=3,4,5 at t=16 or t=19, and not on y=8 at t=19 or t=20.\n\nAt t=19, we are on y=9, not on y=8.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=19 for y=8? But we are not on y=8 at that time.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=18 we are on y=8, which is safe, then we move to y=9 at t=19.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut what about t=19? We are on y=9, fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision times.\n\nFor example, at t=19, if we were on y=5, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn this case, with 4 moves: U at t=15, U at t=16, U at t=17, U at t=18, reaching y=9 at t=19.\n\nt=19 is turn number, and we have actions from t=15 to t=18, and at t=19 we have position.\n\nThe sequence of actions: we need H actions, starting from t=15 to t=15+H-1, and at turn t=15+H-1, we reach y=9? Let's see the indexing.\n\nThe player position after t actions or what.\n\nDefine: at turn t, before action, position is given, then we choose action a_t, then position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t at turn t.\n\nThen at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), and we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision at turn T only if at that turn, on row y_T, 0 in car span.\n\nSo for each turn T, we check y_T and the cars on that row.\n\nIn the sequence, we start at turn t=15, position y_15=5.\n\nAfter choosing a_15, y_16 is set, and so on.\n\nWe need for some H, after H actions, y_{15+H} =9.\n\nThe position at turn t=15+H should be (0,9).\n\nAnd we need to specify the actions from t=15 to t=15+H-1.\n\nFor example, if we go directly, H=4 actions: a_15, a_16, a_17, a_18, and at t=19, y_19=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U:\n\n- Turn t=15: a=U, then y_16=6\n\n- Turn t=16: a=U, y_17=7\n\n- Turn t=17: a=U, y_18=8\n\n- Turn t=18: a=U, y_19=9\n\nNow, check safety:\n\n- At t=15: y=5, safe as before\n\n- At t=16: y=6, safe\n\n- At t=17: y=7, safe\n\n- At t=18: y=8, at t=18, Δt=3, cars on y=8: first car (24,13,right,6), span at T=18: [13+6*3, 24+6*3]? Δt=T-t_1=18-15=3\n\nSpan for first car: [13 + 6*3, 24 + 6*3] = [13+18, 24+18] = [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -35 +6*3, -24 +6*3] = [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\n- At t=19: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=19, we are on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nNow, is there any issue? What about the collision at t=19 on other rows? But we are not on them.\n\nIn this path, we avoided the dangerous times.\n\nBut let's see if we can do in fewer turns? From y=5 to y=9, minimum 4 up moves, so H=4 should be minimal.\n\nBut is it possible to go faster? No, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=5.\n\ny=5 to y=9, difference 4, so at least 4 moves if all up.\n\nWith stay or down, it would take more turns.\n\nSo H=4 should be achievable.\n\nBut in the above, we have a sequence.\n\nBut let's double-check if at any point we are unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, at t=16, we are on y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=3,4,5 unsafe at t=16, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, we are on y=9, not on y=5 or y=8.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at t=19 and t=20, but we are not on it at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=18 we are on y=8, but t=18 is safe, as above.\n\nThen we leave to y=9 at t=19.\n\nNow, but we need to output the actions.\n\nIn this case, with H=4, actions: a_15=U, a_16=U, a_17=U, a_18=U.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=19? No.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we can reach earlier, but we can't.\n\nStart at t=15 y=5, after one move, t=16 y=6 (if U), then t=17 y=7, t=18 y=8, t=19 y=9. So earliest at t=19.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay, but that delays.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision at t=16.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=16 we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut suppose we had stayed or gone down, it would be unsafe or slower.\n\nAnother thing: at t=19, if we were on y=8, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn this sequence, we avoid all collisions.\n\nBut let's see freeway 8 at t=19: unsafe, but we are on y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=19 unsafe, but not on it.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at t=19.\n\nNow, output the actions for turns t=15 to t=18.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t=15: U, t=16: U, t=17: U, t=18: U.\n\nBut is this correct? Let's write.\n\nBut we have to specify the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there are constraints I missed.\n\nAnother point: when moving, the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=18 we are on it, safe, then we move away.\n\nBut what if we had to be on y=8 at later time? But we don't.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but no.\n\nMaybe we can use down or stay to avoid, but in this case not necessary.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason we cannot do this.\n\nFor example, at t=19, we reach, but is t=19 a collision time for some row we might be on? But y=9 no.\n\nPerhaps I need to check the car on y=8 at t=20, but we are not on it.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is at integer turns, and cars move continuously, but since we check at integer turns, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5 at t=19, but we are not on it.\n\nIn this path, we never visit y=3,4,5 except at t=15, which is safe, and y=8 at t=18, safe.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nBut the sequence is simple: all U for 4 turns.\n\nBut H=4, actions from t=15 to t=18.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nWhat about the cars on multiple freeways, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm with another approach.\n\nSuppose we don't go up immediately, but we have to, to avoid t=16 on y=5.\n\nAt t=15, if we do S, then at t=16, y=5, which is unsafe, collision at t=16 on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if D, to y=4 at t=16, also unsafe.\n\nSo only U to y=6 is safe.\n\nThen from y=6, we can go to y=7 or other.\n\nBut y=7 is safe, so go U.\n\nSimilarly to y=8 at t=18.\n\nThen at t=18, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut what if we go to y=8 earlier?\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=16, if we go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThen from y=7 at t=17, if we go U to y=8 at t=18, same as before.\n\nIf we go directly to y=8 from y=6? But we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\ny=6 to y=8 in one move? No, only +1, so to y=7 first.\n\nSo cannot reach faster.\n\nPerhaps we can stay on some row to avoid t=19, but since we go directly to y=9 before t=19, we avoid it.\n\nt=19 we are on y=9.\n\nAnother thing: at t=20, but we don't care, since we reached at t=19.\n\nSo I think H=4 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 8 at t=19 and t=20 unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=8 only at t=18, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=4.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision definition.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, not relevant for us.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=8 to y=9 at turn T=18, at turn T=18, we are on y=8, not on y=9, so we check cars on y=8 at t=18, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=19, we are on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, no other moves.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is straightforward.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\n- Turn 15: U\n\n- Turn 16: U\n\n- Turn 17: U\n\n- Turn 18: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nH=4.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions for t=15 to t=18.\n\nNow, output.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, at t=19 there is collision, but we are not on those rows.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to output for H turns.\n\nAnother thought: at t=15, we are at y=5, and we do U, to y=6 at t=16.\n\nBut y=5 at t=15 is safe.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4, with sequence U,U,U,U.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the box, it should be the actions.\n\nSince it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so t from 0 to 3, a_{15+0}=a_{15}, a_{15+1}=a_{16}, a_{15+2}=a_{17}, a_{15+3}=a_{18}.\n\nAnd at turn t=15+H-1 =15+4-1=18, we perform a_{18}, and then y_{19}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- Based on the car states at turn 15 and their movement rules:\n  - Freeways 1 and 2: No collision at any turn.\n  - Freeways 3, 4, and 5: Collision at turns 16 and 19.\n  - Freeway 6 and 7: No collision at any turn.\n  - Freeway 8: Collision at turns 19 and 20.\n- Freeway 9 has no cars and is safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\n- From \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\), at least 4 upward moves (U) are required, as each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n- At turn 15, the player is at \\(y = 5\\), which is safe at turn 15.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16 is safe, as \\(y = 6\\) has no collisions.\n- Staying at \\(y = 5\\) or moving down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 16 would cause a collision on freeways 3, 4, or 5.\n- Continuing up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18 is safe, as \\(y = 7\\) has no collisions and \\(y = 8\\) is safe at turn 18.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19 reaches the goal safely, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n- This path avoids all collision times:\n  - Not on freeways 3, 4, or 5 at turns 16 or 19.\n  - Not on freeway 8 at turns 19 or 20.\n- The sequence uses 4 turns (\\(H = 4\\)) with actions \\(U, U, U, U\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 15: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16.\n- Turn 16: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17.\n- Turn 17: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18.\n- Turn 18: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, the player reaches (0, 9) safely. No shorter sequence is possible due to the vertical distance.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with a given speed. For collision, if I'm on a freeway y at turn T, and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn, I crash. But if I move to a different y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only check the freeway I'm currently on for that turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 16. Player is at y=6.\n\nCar states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, left-moving, head 48, tail 83, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [48,83] at t1=16. As time increases, it moves left, so span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 36(T-16), 83 - 36(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (48,83,left,36) for both? But freeway 1 and 2 have the same car? No, it's listed separately, so probably different cars but same parameters.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] since tail to head, but in the update, it says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nCollision when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since cars are on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the boundaries, no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,6), which is on freeway y=6? y=6 is a freeway, so I need to avoid cars there at turn 16.\n\nBut at turn 16, I'm at y=6, so I need to check if there is a car on y=6 with 0 in span at T=16.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left, h=48, τ=83, s=36. Span at t=16: [48,83]. Since left-moving, and head is smaller? [h,τ] with h=48, τ=83, so head at 48, tail at 83? That seems odd because usually head is front, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be left, so smaller x if x increases right.\n\nThe notation: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83, so at t=16, x from 48 to 83? But if moving left, and head is at 48, tail at 83, that means the car is from x=48 to x=83, with head at left (48), tail at right (83), moving left, so head decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for example, freeway 3, first car: (0,-11,right,12), so τ=-11, h=0, so [τ,h] = [-11,0], meaning tail at -11, head at 0, moving right, so both increase.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-36,-47,right,12), τ=-47, h=-36? [τ,h] = [-47,-36], so tail -47, head -36.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,12), τ=37, h=48, [37,48].\n\nNow, for freeway 6: (30,19,right,6), but for right-moving, it should be (τ,h), so (30,19) with direction right, so τ=19, h=30? I think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook back: in the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 6: (30,19,right,6), but direction right, so it should be head and tail with head being the front.\n\nFor right-moving, front is larger x, so h should be larger than τ.\n\nHere (30,19,right,6), so h=30, τ=19, and direction right, so [τ,h] = [19,30] at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same (30,19,right,6) so [19,30]\n\nFreeway 8: (30,19,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=30, τ=19, right, so [19,30]\n\nSecond car: h=-18, τ=-29? (-18,-29,right,6), so h=-18, τ=-29, direction right, so [τ,h] = [-29,-18]\n\nNow, back to freeway 3,4,5 all have same cars: three each with (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor (0,-11,right,12): h=0, τ=-11, so [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\n(-36,-47,right,12): h=-36, τ=-47, [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\n(48,37,right,12): h=48, τ=37, [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2: each has one car (48,83,left,36), so for left-moving, h=48, τ=83, so [h,τ] = [48,83] at t=16.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=6 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, and y=9 is above, probably moving up is better, but I have to avoid cars.\n\nAt turn t=16, I am at y=6.\n\nFirst, check if at t=16, on y=6, is there a car with 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 6 has car with [19,30] at t=16, which is from 19 to 30, 0 is not in [19,30], so no collision at t=16 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways don't matter for now.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9. The direct way is to move up three times: U, U, U to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut I need to check for each move if I crash.\n\nFirst, if I move U at t=16, I go to y=7 at turn t=17.\n\nAt turn t=17, I am on y=7.\n\nNow, is there a car on y=7 with 0 in span at t=17.\n\nFreeway 7 has a car: at t=16, [19,30] for the car, but since right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nt1=16, s=6 for this car.\n\nAt T=17, τ + s(17-16) = 19 + 6*1 = 25, h + s(1) = 30 + 6 = 36, so span [25,36] at t=17.\n\n0 not in [25,36], so safe.\n\nThen at t=17, I am on y=7, no crash.\n\nThen I move U again at t=17 to y=8 at t=18.\n\nNow at t=18, on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: (30,19,right,6) at t=16, so [19,30], at T=18, τ + s(2) = 19 + 12 = 31, h + s(2) = 30 + 12 = 42, so [31,42]\n\nSecond car: (-18,-29,right,6) at t=16, [τ,h] = [-29,-18], at T=18, τ + s(2) = -29 + 12 = -17, h + s(2) = -18 + 12 = -6, so [-17,-6]\n\n0 is not in [31,42] nor in [-17,-6], so safe.\n\nThen move U at t=18 to y=9 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car, safe. And I reached y=9.\n\nSo in 3 turns: actions at t=16,17,18: U,U,U to y=7,8,9 at t=17,18,19.\n\nt=16: at y=6, after action, at t=17 y=7; t=17 action, t=18 y=8; t=18 action, t=19 y=9.\n\nH=3 turns, from t=16 to t=18 actions, position at t=19 is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=16 to t=16+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=16+H, position is (0,9).\n\nLet's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAt time t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStart at t=16, y_16 = 6.\n\nAfter a_{16}, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}\n\nThen at t=17, after a_{17}, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9, since after H actions, at time t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 = 16, so at time 16 + H, y=9.\n\nAnd we take H actions from t=16 to t=16+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with three actions: a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, then at t=19, y=9.\n\nNow, in this path, at each step, no collision, as we checked.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=3 is the minimum since I need to go from 6 to 9, three steps up, and I can't jump, so min H=3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that staying or moving down doesn't help, but since 9 is up, moving down would take more turns, so H=3 should be achievable if safe.\n\nIn this case, it seems safe, but let me double-check the cars.\n\nAt t=16, on y=6: freeway 6 has car [19,30] at t=16, 0 not in, ok.\n\nAt t=17, on y=7: freeway 7 has car, at t=16 [19,30], at t=17 [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=18, on y=8: freeway 8, first car [19,30] at t=16, at t=18 [19+12,30+12]=[31,42], second car [-29,-18] at t=16, at t=18 [-29+12, -18+12]=[-17,-6], 0 not in either.\n\nThen at t=19, y=9, no car.\n\nBut what about other freeways? For example, if I were on other y, but in this path, I'm only on y=6,7,8 at t=16,17,18 respectively, and only check those freeways at those times.\n\nNow, but freeway 3,4,5 have cars, but I'm not on them, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 and 2.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 6: only one car, (30,19,right,6), which we used.\n\nBut in the state, for freeway 6, it says (30,19,right,6), and since right, [τ,h] = [19,30] at t=16.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, (30,19,right,6), so [19,30] at t=16.\n\nBut at t=17, for y=7, we have [19+6,30+6]=[25,36]\n\nNow freeway 8: has two cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst: (30,19,right,6) so [19,30] at t=16\n\nSecond: (-18,-29,right,6), h=-18, τ=-29, so [τ,h] = [-29,-18] at t=16.\n\nAt t=18, for y=8: first car: [19 + 6*2, 30 + 12] = [19+12,30+12]=[31,42]\n\ns=6, T-t1=18-16=2, so τ + s*2 =19+12=31, h+s*2=30+12=42\n\nSecond car: τ + s*2 = -29 + 12 = -17, h + s*2 = -18 + 12 = -6, so [-17,-6]\n\n0 not in, yes.\n\nBut is there a problem at y=8? No.\n\nPerhaps I should check if moving directly is fine.\n\nBut let me see the cars on other rows, in case I need to avoid.\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, there are cars, but since I'm not going there, it should be fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if at any point 0 is covered, but only for the row I'm on.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am on the starting y, and after action, I am on the new y at next turn.\n\nIn this case, all seems fine.\n\nBut the player position is given at (0,y), and cars are on the freeway, but x=0 is the position, so we care if 0 is in the car span.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nIn this path, no issue.\n\nBut let me check if for y=8 at t=18, is there any car with 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: [31,42] and [-17,-6], 0 not between -17 and -6? -17 to -6, 0 is greater than -6? -6 < 0, but -17 to -6 is all negative, 0 not included. Similarly [31,42] positive.\n\nSo ok.\n\nBut what about freeway 3,4,5? For example, at t=16, on freeway 5, there is a car with [ -11, 0 ]? Freeway 3 car: (0,-11,right,12), so [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t=16.\n\n[ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included? -11 to 0, inclusive, I assume, so 0 is in [ -11, 0 ], so if I were on y=3 at t=16, I would crash, but I'm not, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, other places.\n\nBut in my path, I'm on y=6,7,8, all fine.\n\nBut let me see if at some other time, for example, if I stay or something, but I don't need to.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in fewer than 3? No, from 6 to 9, must increase by 3, each action at most +1, so min 3 actions.\n\nUnless I can go up faster, but no, only +1 per up.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot go directly? For example, if at some point, moving up would cause collision.\n\nIn this case, at t=16, moving U to y=7 at t=17, which is safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=18, safe.\n\nTo y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut what about the cars on freeway 8 at t=18? We have [31,42] and [-17,-6], both not covering 0.\n\nBut let me confirm the second car on freeway 8: (-18,-29,right,6), so h=-18, τ=-29, [τ,h] = [-29,-18] at t=16.\n\nAt t=18, [ -29 + 6*2, -18 + 12 ] = [ -29+12, -18+12 ] = [-17, -6]\n\n-6 is less than 0, so from -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, if it were [-6, -17], but it's not, it's from -17 to -6, so min to max.\n\nIn interval notation, [a,b] with a<b.\n\nHere [-17,-6], so -17 to -6, 0 not in.\n\nOk.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if the car spans include 0 at some other turn.\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, at t=16, there is a car with [-11,0], so 0 included, so if I were on y=5 at t=16, crash.\n\nBut I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, another thing: the cars on freeway 3,4,5 are all the same: each has three cars, including one with [ -11, 0 ] at t=16.\n\nBut at later times, it moves.\n\nFor example, the car on y=3 with [ -11, 0 ] at t=16, right-moving, s=12, so at T, [ -11 + 12(T-16), 0 + 12(T-16) ]\n\nAt T=17, [ -11 +12, 0+12] = [1,12]\n\nAt T=18, [ -11+24, 0+24] = [13,24], etc.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut since I'm not on those rows, no issue.\n\nNow, back to my plan: actions U at t=16, U at t=17, U at t=18.\n\nBut at t=18, I am on y=8, and I move U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut when I am on y=8 at t=18, I need to be safe, which I am.\n\nIs there a car that might cover 0 at t=18 on y=8? No.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 cars again.\n\nFreeway 8: first car (30,19,right,6) -> [19,30] at t=16, at t=18: [19+12,30+12]=[31,42]\n\nSecond car (-18,-29,right,6) -> [-29,-18] at t=16, at t=18: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6]\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can go faster, but no.\n\nMaybe by moving down first, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=5, but at t=16, y=5 has car with 0 in span? Freeway 5 has (0,-11,right,12) at t=16, [ -11, 0 ], 0 included, so if I go to y=5 at any time when 0 is in some car span.\n\nBut in my path, I don't go there.\n\nSuppose I try to go directly, but it seems fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 1 and 2.\n\nFreeway 1: left-moving, h=48, τ=83, s=36, [48,83] at t=16.\n\nAt T, [48 - 36(T-16), 83 - 36(T-16)]\n\nFor example, when does it cover 0? Set 48 - 36(T-16) <= 0 <= 83 - 36(T-16)\n\nSince moving left, the left end decreases.\n\n48 - 36(T-16) <= 0 when 36(T-16) >= 48, T-16 >= 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so T>=17.333, so at T=18, left end: 48-36*2=48-72=-24, right end:83-72=11, so at T=18, span [-24,11], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=19: 48-108=-60, 83-108=-25, [-60,-25], no 0.\n\nSo on freeway 1, at T=18, if I am on y=1, I crash because 0 in [-24,11].\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on y=1 at t=18, so ok.\n\nNow, back to y=8 at t=18, I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 8 cars.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst: h=30, τ=19, so [19,30] at t=16\n\nAt t=18: [19+12,30+12]=[31,42]\n\nSecond: h=-18, τ=-29, so [τ,h] = [-29,-18] at t=16\n\nAt t=18: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6]\n\nNow, is -6 included? The span is inclusive, I assume.\n\n-17 to -6, so numbers from -17 to -6 inclusive, all less than 0, so 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, no car near 0 on y=8 at t=18.\n\nTherefore, the path should work.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and y=9 is safe.\n\nSo with three actions: U at t=16, U at t=17, U at t=18.\n\nThen at t=19, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=16, t=17, t=18.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=16.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? No.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or move down to avoid something, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nMaybe at some point, if I move down, I can use a faster path, but no, since all rows have cars, but min to go up is 3.\n\nFor example, from y=6, if I go to y=5, but at t=16, y=5 has car at [ -11,0 ] which includes 0, so if I go to y=5 at t=17, let's see.\n\nIf at t=16 I move D, to y=5 at t=17.\n\nThen at t=17, on y=5, need to check cars.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars at t=17.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) at t=16 [ -11,0 ], at t=17: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12]\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) at t=16 [ -47,-36], at t=17: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24]\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,12) at t=16 [37,48], at t=17: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60]\n\nAt t=17, on y=5, spans [1,12], [-35,-24], [49,60], 0 not in any, so safe? 0 not in [1,12], since 1 to 12, all positive, 0 not included.\n\nBut at t=16, if I were on y=5, it would crash, but at t=17, the car has moved.\n\nThen from y=5, I need to go to y=9, which takes more actions, at least 4 more, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, other paths not better.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nBut in my direct path, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check at t=18 on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars moving right, s=6.\n\nAt t=16: first car [19,30], second car [-29,-18]\n\nAt t=18: first car [19 + 6*2, 30 + 12] = [19+12,30+12]=[31,42]? s=6, delta t=2, so increase by 12.\n\nτ + s delta t, but τ=19, so 19+12=31, h=30+12=42.\n\nBut [31,42], 31 to 42.\n\nSecond car: τ=-29, h=-18, at t=16.\n\nAt t=18: τ + s delta t = -29 + 12 = -17, h + s delta t = -18 + 12 = -6, so [-17, -6]\n\n-6 is greater than -17, so [-17, -6], which is from -17 to -6, inclusive.\n\n0 is not in this interval since -6 < 0.\n\n-6 is less than 0, so all values negative, 0 not included.\n\nIf the span included 0, but it doesn't.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1 at t=18, it does include 0, but I'm not there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3 with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 3,4,5 at other times, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if by staying or moving down, I can avoid a future collision, but in this case, no need since direct is safe.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=16, when I am at y=6, I take action, but the action affects y_{t+1}, and collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or after action?\n\nThe collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T, I think.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and if on freeway y_T, and 0 in span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T, before action, I am at y_T, and I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nSo for collision, at each turn T, I am on y_T, and we check if there is a car on row y_T with 0 in span at that turn T.\n\nIn my path:\n\nAt t=16: y=6, freeway 6, car [19,30] at t=16, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, so y_{17} =7.\n\nAt t=17: y=7, freeway 7, car at t=17: [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{18}=8.\n\nAt t=18: y=8, freeway 8, cars at t=18: [31,42] and [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{19}=9.\n\nAt t=19: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if on other rows there is danger, but since I don't go there, no.\n\nFor example, at t=18, on freeway 1, as I said, span [-24,11], includes 0, so if I were on y=1 at t=18, crash.\n\nBut I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, on freeway 5 at t=16, [ -11,0 ] includes 0, but I'm not there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 with actions U, U, U.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,6) at turn t1=16.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in less, impossible.\n\nPerhaps by moving up faster, but no.\n\nOr if I stay and then move, but same or more turns.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car (-18,-29,right,6), and at t=18, [-17,-6], which is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the tail and head.\n\nIn the input, it says for freeway 8: (30,19,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFor the second, head h=-18, tail τ=-29, and since right-moving, tail at -29, head at -18, so the car is from x=-29 to x=-18, moving right.\n\nAt t=18, from x=-29+12= -17 to x=-18+12= -6, so from -17 to -6.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I think I'm overthinking.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t_1=16.\n\nPerhaps write as:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince it says \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nWith H=3.\n\nSo actions at t=16,17,18.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns \\(H\\) required to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3, as each \"U\" action increases the y-coordinate by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve the required increase of 3 units.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 16, action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nCollision checks for each turn in the path:\n- **Turn 16 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 has a car with span [19, 30] at turn 16. Since 0 is not in [19, 30], no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 17 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 has a car with span [25, 36] at turn 17 (calculated from [19, 30] at turn 16 with speed 6, right-moving: \\(19 + 6 \\times 1 = 25\\), \\(30 + 6 \\times 1 = 36\\)). Since 0 is not in [25, 36], no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 18 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 has two cars:\n  - First car: [31, 42] at turn 18 (from [19, 30] at turn 16 with speed 6, right-moving: \\(19 + 6 \\times 2 = 31\\), \\(30 + 6 \\times 2 = 42\\)).\n  - Second car: [-17, -6] at turn 18 (from [-29, -18] at turn 16 with speed 6, right-moving: \\(-29 + 6 \\times 2 = -17\\), \\(-18 + 6 \\times 2 = -6\\)).\n  Since 0 is not in [31, 42] or [-17, -6], no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 19 (y=9)**: y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars are present, and the position is safe.\n\nThus, the sequence avoids all collisions and reaches (0, 9) in 3 turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 17, and the player is at (0,7). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player always is).\n\nImportant: When the player moves (U or D) at turn T, at the end of the turn they are at the new y. However, during the turn T, they are still on the old freeway (if moving from y to y+1, then at turn T they are on y, and at turn T+1 they are on y+1). Therefore, when moving at turn T from y to y+1:\n- At turn T, the player is on y, so we check for cars on freeway y at turn T: if any car on freeway y has 0 in its span at T, then collision.\n- At turn T+1, the player is on y+1, so we check for cars on freeway y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if the player stays at the same freeway at turn T, then we check that freeway at turn T.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. Note that y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1 to 8) so once we are at y=9, we are safe and don't need to worry about cars.\n\nWe start at y=7 at turn 17. We need to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves would be 2 (if we can go up twice without colliding). But we must check the car positions at the turns we are on freeways 7 and 8.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns, starting from turn 17.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car spans at any turn T (for T>=17). The turn difference is dT = T - 17.\n\nFor each car, we have:\n- Left-moving: span at T = [h - s*dT, tau - s*dT]   (note: the problem says for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] becomes [h - s*dT, tau - s*dT])\n- Right-moving: span at T = [tau + s*dT, h + s*dT]   (because for right-moving, the initial span is given as [tau, h]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" becomes [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT]. But note the table gives (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, the head is at the right? Actually, the problem says for left: \"head is at h, tail is at tau\", and then the span is [h, tau]? But that would be from h to tau, and if h>tau then it's [tau, h]? I think there might be a confusion.\n\nLooking back: \n- For left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at tau\" and the span is [h, tau] -> but if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be the rightmost? Actually, the problem says: \"Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> [h-s*dT, tau-s*dT]\". This implies that h and tau are the positions at t1, and the car extends from h to tau. But if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the ordering. But note: the span is an interval. For left-moving, the entire car moves left, so the positions decrease. Similarly for right.\n\nBut note: in the table, for freeway 3,4,5 we have a car (12,1,right,12). The head is 12, tail is 1? Then if it's right-moving, the span at t1=17 is [1,12]? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" becomes [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT]. So they are giving head and tail, and then for right-moving they define the span as [tail, head]? That seems to be the case.\n\nSo let me reinterpret:\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s):\n- If d is left: then the car's span at t1 is [min(h,tau), max(h,tau)]? Actually, the problem says: \"head is at h, tail is at tau\", and then for left: span(t1)=[h, tau] -> [h-s*dT, tau-s*dT]. This suggests that the span is from h to tau. But if h and tau are given arbitrarily? \n\nLooking at the data: \nFor freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) -> at t1=17, the car is from 12 to 47? But 12<47, so [12,47]. Then moving left: at T, [12-36*dT, 47-36*dT]. But note: the car is moving left, so the entire segment shifts left. Similarly, for a right-moving car: (12,1,right,12) -> the problem says for right: span(t1)=[tau, h] -> [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT]. So in this case, tau=1, h=12? Then the span at t1 is [1,12] and then at T: [1+12*dT, 12+12*dT].\n\nBut wait: the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\". So the head is h and tail is tau, and they are giving (head, tail) in that order? Then for right-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, but the span is [tau, h] meaning the tail is the left end and head is the right end? That makes sense because the car moves right, so the head (front) is at the right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: head is at h, tail at tau. The car moves left, so the head (front) is at the left? Then the span would be [h, tau] only if h < tau? Actually, the problem doesn't specify which is larger. But in the data, we have for left: (12,47,left,36): if head is 12 and tail is 47, then the car is from 12 to 47? But then moving left: the head (front) is at 12, which is less than 47? That doesn't make sense because if it's moving left, the front should be at the leftmost? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the coordinate system. But note: the collision condition is if 0 is in the span. So we just need the interval.\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, d, s) at t1=17:\n- If d is left: the span at time T (>=17) is [h - s*(T-17), tau - s*(T-17)].\n- If d is right: the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-17), h + s*(T-17)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT]. So the initial span at t1 is [tau, h]. Therefore, the car covers the interval [min(tau,h), max(tau,h)]? Actually, the problem does not specify that tau and h are ordered. But the representation [tau, h] implies that tau is the left end and h the right end? Or the opposite? Actually, the problem says for right: the span is [tau, h] and then moves to [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT]. So if tau < h, then the car is from tau to h. If tau>h, then the car is from h to tau? But that would be inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the data for freeway 3: \n(12,1,right,12): head=12, tail=1. Then the span at t1 is [1,12]? because [tail, head] = [1,12]. Then at T, [1+12*(T-17), 12+12*(T-17)].\n\nSimilarly, for left: (12,47,left,36): head=12, tail=47. Then the span at t1 is [12,47]? But that would be from 12 to 47, which is increasing? Then moving left: [12-36*(T-17), 47-36*(T-17)].\n\nBut note: if the car is moving left, then the entire segment moves left, so the leftmost point decreases. So if the car is from 12 to 47, then the leftmost point is 12 and rightmost 47. Then after moving left, the leftmost becomes 12-36*dT and rightmost 47-36*dT.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: if the car is from 1 to 12, then after moving right, it becomes 1+12*dT to 12+12*dT.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right: the span is [tau, h] and then [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT]. So if tau < h, then the car is from tau to h, and then moves to the right. But if tau>h? Then the car would be from h to tau? But that doesn't happen in the data: in the left example, head=12 and tail=47, so tail>head? Then the span [12,47] is increasing? So the car is from 12 to 47? Then moving left, both decrease.\n\nSo we'll assume that the span is always given as [left_end, right_end] for the initial state? Actually, no: the problem states the head and tail. For left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau. But if the car is moving left, the head (front) should be the leftmost? Then if head=12 and tail=47, that would imply the head is at 12 and the tail at 47, meaning the car extends from 12 to the right to 47? Then the car is 35 units long? Then moving left: the head goes to 12-36*dT and the tail to 47-36*dT. But then the head is still the leftmost? Actually, if the car moves left, the head (front) is at the left, so the entire car is to the right of the head. So the car would be [head, head+L] where L is the length? But we don't have the length, we have head and tail. The problem says \"head\" and \"tail\", so the tail is the other end. So the car spans from min(head,tail) to max(head,tail)? Actually, no: if the car is facing left, the head is the leftmost? Then the tail would be at head+length? Then the span would be [head, tail] with head<tail? But in the data, for left: (12,47) -> head=12, tail=47, so head<tail? Then the car is from 12 to 47? Then moving left: the entire segment shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right: (12,1,right,12): head=12, tail=1. If the car is facing right, the head should be the rightmost? Then the tail would be at head-length? So the car would be from tail to head? Then the span is [tail, head] = [1,12]. Then moving right: [1+12*dT, 12+12*dT].\n\nSo the representation is consistent: the car always covers the interval [min(head,tail), max(head,tail)]? Actually, no: for left, head=12, tail=47 -> min=12, max=47. For right, head=12, tail=1 -> min=1, max=12. Then the initial span is [min, max]. Then the movement:\n- Left: [min - s*dT, max - s*dT]\n- Right: [min + s*dT, max + s*dT]? Actually, no: for left, the entire car moves left, so both endpoints decrease. For right, both increase.\n\nBut the problem says for left: [h - s*dT, tau - s*dT] -> so if h=12 and tau=47, then [12-36*dT, 47-36*dT]. For right: [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT] -> for (12,1,right,12): [1+12*dT, 12+12*dT]. So we can compute the interval as:\n- Left: [h - s*dT, tau - s*dT]   (with h and tau as given, regardless of which is larger)\n- Right: [tau + s*dT, h + s*dT]   (again, tau and h as given)\n\nBut note: in the left case, if h>tau? Then the interval would be [h - s*dT, tau - s*dT] which would be backwards? But the problem doesn't specify that the interval is given in increasing order. However, for collision we only care if 0 is in the interval, which is a closed interval. So if the interval is [a,b] and a>b, then it's empty? Actually, no: we should consider the interval as the set of points between min(a,b) and max(a,b). But the problem doesn't say. However, the collision condition is \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so we should interpret Span(T) as the set of x such that min(a,b) <= x <= max(a,b).\n\nBut the update: for left, [h - s*dT, tau - s*dT] might have h - s*dT > tau - s*dT? Then we take the min and max. Similarly for right.\n\nTo be safe, we can define for a car:\ndT = T - 17\nif direction is left:\n   a = h - s*dT\n   b = tau - s*dT\n   span = [min(a,b), max(a,b)]\n\nif direction is right:\n   a = tau + s*dT\n   b = h + s*dT\n   span = [min(a,b), max(a,b)]\n\nBut note: the problem says for right: the span is [tau+s*dT, h+s*dT] and doesn't specify ordering. So to check if 0 is in the interval, we can do:\n   if min(a,b) <= 0 <= max(a,b)\n\nBut let's compute for the given cars at T=17 (dT=0) to see:\n\nFreeway 1: left: h=12, tau=47 -> a=12, b=47 -> [12,47] -> 0 is not in [12,47] -> safe at T=17 for freeway1? But we are at y=7, so we don't care about freeway1 at T=17.\n\nNow, we are at turn 17 at y=7. We need to move to y=9. The path: \nOption 1: \n  Turn 17: U -> to y=8 at turn 18? But note: at turn 17, we are at y=7. When we do U at turn 17, then at the end of turn 17 we are at y=8. So at turn 17, we were at y=7, and at turn 18 we are at y=8.\n\nBut collision check: at turn T, we check the freeway y that we are on at that turn.\n- At turn 17: we are at y=7. So we check freeway 7 at T=17.\n- At turn 18: we are at y=8 (if we did U at 17). Then we check freeway 8 at T=18.\n- Then at turn 19: we could do U again to go to y=9 (which is safe).\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so H=2: two moves: U at 17, then U at 18.\n\nBut we must check for collisions:\n\n1. At turn 17: we are at y=7. What cars are on freeway 7?\n   Freeway 7: (36,25,right,6) -> but wait, the table says:\n      Freeway 7: (36,25,right,6)\n   So one car: head=36, tail=25, direction=right, speed=6.\n\n   For right-moving: at T=17 (dT=0): \n      a = tau + s*dT = 25 + 6*0 = 25\n      b = h + s*dT = 36 + 0 = 36\n      So the span is [min(25,36), max(25,36)] = [25,36]. \n      Is 0 in [25,36]? No. So safe.\n\n2. At turn 18: we are at y=8. What cars on freeway 8?\n   Freeway 8: (36,25,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) -> two cars.\n\n   For the first car: (36,25,right,6): at T=18, dT=1.\n      a = 25 + 6*1 = 31\n      b = 36 + 6*1 = 42 -> [31,42] -> 0 not in.\n\n   For the second car: (-12,-23,right,6): \n      head=-12, tail=-23, direction=right, speed=6.\n      At T=18: \n        a = tau + s*dT = -23 + 6*1 = -17\n        b = h + s*dT = -12 + 6 = -6\n        So the span is [min(-17,-6), max(-17,-6)] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in.\n\n   So both safe.\n\nThen we can do:\nTurn 17: U -> to y=8 at the end of turn 17 (so at turn 18 we are at y=8)\nTurn 18: U -> to y=9 at the end of turn 18 (so at turn 19 we are at y=9)\n\nBut note: at turn 18, we are at y=8 during the entire turn? Actually, the movement happens during the turn. The problem says: \n  \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn 17: \n  - We start at y=7.\n  - We choose action U -> so we end at y=8.\n  - During turn 17, we are on y=7. So we check freeway 7 at T=17 -> safe.\n\nAt turn 18:\n  - We start at y=8.\n  - We choose action U -> end at y=9.\n  - During turn 18, we are on y=8. So we check freeway 8 at T=18 -> safe.\n\nThen we are at y=9 at the end of turn 18? Actually, at the end of turn 18 we are at y=9. So we have reached the goal at turn 18? But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of turn H-1? Actually, the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1 (where t=0 corresponds to t1=17). So the last action is at t=H-1, and then the position at the end of that action is (0,9). \n\nSo with H=2: \n  t=0 (turn 17): U -> y becomes 8\n  t=1 (turn 18): U -> y becomes 9\n\nThen at the end of turn 18 (which is the second action, at t=1) we are at (0,9). So we are done.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=2. Is it possible to do in 1? \n  Only if we can go from 7 to 9 in one move? But we can only change by +1 per move. So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut let me double-check if at turn 18 on freeway 8 we are safe. We did check: both cars at T=18 on freeway8 do not cover 0.\n\nHowever, note that there is another car on freeway8: the table says two cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6). We checked both.\n\nBut wait, the table for freeway8 says: \n  (36,25,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nBut the first car: (36,25,right,6) -> head=36, tail=25? Then the initial span at T=17: [25,36]. Then at T=18: [25+6,36+6]=[31,42]. \nThe second car: head=-12, tail=-23 -> then the initial span at T=17: [-23,-12]? Then at T=18: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6]. \nBoth do not include 0.\n\nBut what about freeway7 at turn17: we checked the car (36,25,right,6) -> at T=17: [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for freeway 7: only one car? The table says for freeway7: (36,25,right,6) -> only one car.\n\nBut in the table, freeway6 also has (36,25,right,6) and freeway8 has two. But we are only concerned with freeway7 at T=17 and freeway8 at T=18.\n\nBut let me check freeway7 at T=17: only one car (36,25,right,6) -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So when we are at a freeway, we must avoid all cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut what if we stay? We don't have to, because we are moving.\n\nBut wait, is there any reason to go down? No, because we need to go up to 9.\n\nBut what if going up twice is blocked? Then we might have to wait or go around. But in this case, it's not blocked.\n\nBut let me check the other freeways that we might cross? Actually, we are only at freeway7 at T=17 and freeway8 at T=18. We don't go through any other freeway.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway8 at T=17? We are not on freeway8 at T=17, so we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So H=2, and actions at t1=17 and t1+1=18.\n\nBut the answer format: \n  Turn 17: U\n  Turn 18: U\n\nBut wait, the initial state is at turn 17, and we are at y=7. Then after turn17 (action U), we are at y=8 at the start of turn18? Actually, the state after the action is the state for the next turn.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\". So:\n  t=0: a_{17} = U\n  t=1: a_{18} = U\n\nSo we write:\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in one turn? That is impossible because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, if we do nothing? We are at 7, we need to go to 9, so we must move up twice.\n\nBut what if we move up at 17 to 8, then at 18 we cannot move up because freeway8 at T=18 is blocked? Then we would have to wait? But in this case, it is not blocked.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the car movements for a few more turns? Maybe there is a car that will come to 0 at T=18? But we already did.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously. However, we have computed freeway8 at T=18: safe.\n\nBut wait, there is a car on freeway8: the second car (-12,-23,right,6) at T=18: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nBut what about at T=19? We don't care because we are at y=9 at the end of T=18.\n\nBut the problem says: we are at (0,9) at the end of the last action (which is turn18). Then we are done.\n\nBut let me check if there is any other constraint? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. We are moving from 7 to 8 (valid) and then 8 to 9 (valid).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". We have H=2 and the sequence above.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without moving? We are at 7, so we need to move.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up at 17 to 8, then at 18 we could stay? But then we are at 8, not 9. Then we would have to move again at 19. That would be H=3, which is not minimal.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nBut just to be safe, let me check if at T=18 on freeway8, is there any car that covers 0? We have two cars: [31,42] and [-17,-6] -> both away from 0.\n\nBut wait, what about the car on freeway3,4,5? They are on different freeways. We are not on freeway3,4,5 at any turn we are moving, so we don't care.\n\nBut note: the freeway we are on is the y coordinate. We are at y=7 at T=17 and y=8 at T=18.\n\nTherefore, we are safe.\n\nBut wait, the table has for freeway 3,4,5: multiple cars. But we don't step on those freeways.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut what if we consider the car on freeway8 at T=17? We are not on freeway8 at T=17, so we don't check.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is two ups.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions\", and we have avoided.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway7 at T=17: the car (36,25,right,6) -> [25,36] -> 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAt T=18 on freeway8: two cars: [31,42] and [-17,-6] -> 0 not in. Safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", and H=2, so t=0,1: t=0 for turn17, t=1 for turn18.\n\nSo we write for turn17 and turn18.\n\nBut the initial turn is t1=17, and we are to start from there.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 17 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal path requires moving up twice:\n- From y = 7 to y = 8 at turn 17 (action U).\n- From y = 8 to y = 9 at turn 18 (action U).\n\nThis sequence takes 2 turns (H = 2). Collision checks are performed as follows:\n\n- **At turn 17 (y = 7):**  \n  Freeway 7 has one car: (36, 25, right, 6).  \n  At T = 17 (dT = 0):  \n  Span = [25, 36] (since tau = 25, h = 36, and direction is right).  \n  0 is not in [25, 36] → safe.\n\n- **At turn 18 (y = 8):**  \n  Freeway 8 has two cars:  \n  - (36, 25, right, 6): At T = 18 (dT = 1), span = [25 + 6×1, 36 + 6×1] = [31, 42].  \n  - (-12, -23, right, 6): At T = 18 (dT = 1), span = [-23 + 6×1, -12 + 6×1] = [-17, -6].  \n  0 is not in [31, 42] or [-17, -6] → safe.\n\nAfter turn 18, the player reaches y = 9, which is not a freeway, so no further collision checks are needed. No shorter path exists, as moving from y = 7 to y = 9 requires at least two up moves.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1 = 18, and they move based on their speed and direction. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving, it moves right. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and there is a car on that freeway where 0 is within its span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y-position, you are not on that new row until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T during turn T, and only on y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), there are no cars on y=9, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe. But I need to be at (0,9) at the end of a turn.\n\nCurrently at turn t_1=18, position (0,8). So y=8.\n\nI need to go to y=9. That's only one step up, but I have to make sure that when I move, I don't collide with cars on y=8 or other rows I might be on.\n\nBut since I'm starting at y=8, and I want to go to y=9, I can potentially move up immediately if it's safe.\n\nBut I need to check if at turn 18, on y=8, there is a car that collides with me. Collision is defined based on the car's span including 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=18.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, head h=-24, tail tau=11, speed s=36. Since it's left-moving, the span is [h, tau] = [-24, 11], and as time increases, it moves left, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)].\n\nt1=18.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision at turn T, we care about whether 0 is in the span at that T.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, there are cars: one with (42,31, right, 6) and another with (-6,-17, right, 6).\n\nFirst, right-moving car: direction right, so for right-moving, the span is given as [tau, h]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, it's [tau, h], which means tau is the left end, h is the right end, since as it moves right, both increase.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 3,4,5, cars like (24,13,right,12), so if [tau,h] = [13,24]? But it says (24,13,right,12), so head=24, tail=13? But for right-moving, head should be the front, which is higher x, tail lower.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving, head is the left end? In left-moving, head h=-24, tail tau=11, and since it's left-moving, head should be the leftmost point? h=-24, tau=11, so if head is left, tail is right, but as it moves left, head decreases faster? I think I need to interpret the span.\n\nFrom the update, for left-moving: at T, span [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince s>0, h - sΔT < tau - sΔT, so the left end is h - sΔT, right end is tau - sΔT.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT], so left end is tau + sΔT, right end is h + sΔT.\n\nIn the notation, for both, head and tail: for left-moving, head is the left end, tail is the right end? In freeway 1: head h=-24, tail tau=11, left-moving, so at t1, left end -24, right end 11.\n\nAs it moves left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end? In freeway 3: (24,13,right,12), so head=24, tail=13, and since right-moving, at t1, span [tau, h] = [13,24], so left end 13, right end 24.\n\nThen at T, [13 + sΔT, 24 + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8: (42,31,right,6) and (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=42, tail=31, direction right, so at t1, left end tau=31, right end h=42.\n\nSecond car: head=-6, tail=-17, direction right, so left end tau=-17, right end h=-6.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y, and for some car on y, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nPlayer at turn T is on y_T, which is determined at the beginning of turn T, I think? Let's see the dynamics.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with action at t affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t), and performs action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen during turn t, the player is on row y_t.\n\nCollision at turn T if 0 is in span of some car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\ny_T is the row the player is on during turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=18, player is on y=8.\n\nI need to check if at turn 18, on freeway 8, there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars at t=18:\n\nFirst car: (42,31,right,6), so span at t=18: left end = tau + s(0) =31, right end = h + s(0) =42, since ΔT=0. t1=18, T=18, ΔT=0.\n\nSo span [31,42], 0 is not in [31,42], so no.\n\nSecond car: (-6,-17,right,6), head=-6, tail=-17, so left end tau + s*0 = -17, right end h + s*0 = -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in [-17,-6], so at t=18, no collision on y=8.\n\nTherefore, at turn 18, it is safe to be on y=8.\n\nNow, I want to move to y=9. To do that, I perform action U at turn 18, which will set y_{19} = y_{18} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nBut during turn 18, I am still on y=8, and I perform U, so for collision during turn 18, I am on y=8, which we saw is safe.\n\nThen at turn 19, I will be on y=9, and since y=9 is not a freeway, no cars, so I am safe, and I have reached (0,9).\n\nThe sequence would be just one action: at turn 18, U.\n\nThen at turn 19, position is (0,9), so I reached in one turn? H is the number of turns, from t to t+H-1.\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, we reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe player position: at turn t_1, y_{t1} =8.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nIf I do U at t1, y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, the turn is t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso, in the answer format, it shows actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAt turn t1, we perform a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0, y_{t1+1})\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =9, but currently y_{t1}=8, not 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=1, then t1 +1 -1 = t1, y_{t1}=8 ≠9.\n\nIf H=2, then y_{t1 +2 -1} = y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nSo we need to reach position at turn t1+1 to be (0,9).\n\nWhich means we need to set y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nSince y_{t1} =8, we can do U at turn t1, so y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nAnd we need to ensure that during the turns we are on freeways, no collision.\n\nIn this case, only turn t1=18, we are on y=8, which we checked is safe.\n\nThen at turn t1+1=19, we are on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo with one action: at turn 18, U.\n\nH=1? But y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{18 +1 -1} = y_{18} =8 ≠9.\n\nH should be such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, y_{t1 +1-1} = y_{t1} =8 ≠9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{t1 +2-1} = y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nSo H=2, with actions at t= t1 and t1+1, but we only need one action to move to y=9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t=t1 and t=t1+1.\n\nBut if I do U at t1, y_{t1+1}=9, then at t1+1, position is (0,9), so I have reached.\n\nBut I also need to specify action at t1+1? No, after action at t1+1, y_{t1+2} would be set.\n\nBut I don't need to go further; I just need y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nWith action at t1 only, U, then y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nThen for H=2, I need two actions? But the second action is not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can do S at t1+1 or something, but that would keep me at 9 or move away.\n\nThe minimal H should be the number of actions to reach in minimal turns.\n\nLet's see the indices.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1}=8.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1+k, position y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, y_{t1} =8, not 9.\n\nAfter one action at t1, y_{t1+1} =9 if U.\n\nThen y_{t1+1} =9, which is at turn t1+1.\n\nNow, t1 + H -1 = t1+1, so H-1 =1, thus H=2.\n\nWith H=2, we have actions at t=t1 and t=t1+1.\n\nAt t=t1, I do U, then y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nAt t=t1+1, I need to do an action, but since I am already at y=9, I can do S (stay), so y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} +0 =9, but the position at turn t1+1 is already (0,9), so we are done at turn t1+1.\n\nThe condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which for H=2, y_{t1+2-1} = y_{t1+1} =9, good.\n\nAnd I need to specify both actions, but the second action doesn't affect the position at t1+1, it affects y_{t1+2}, but since we only care about reaching at turn t1+1, y_{t1+2} can be anything, but we have to specify the action for the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, so for H=2, t=0 and t=1, actions a_{t1+0} and a_{t1+1}.\n\na_{t1} = U, a_{t1+1} = S, for example.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0,9), reached.\n\nH=2 turns? The turns involved are turn t1 and t1+1, so two turns.\n\nBut the action at t1+1 is not necessary for reaching, but to have the sequence, I need to include it.\n\nI could reach in one \"step\" but the turn count includes the starting turn.\n\nAnother way: the player is at position at the start of each turn.\n\nAt start of turn t1, position (0,8).\n\nAfter action a_t, position changes for next turn.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the start of some turn.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=1, turn t1, position (0,8) not (0,9).\n\nFor H=2, turn t1+1, position (0,9) if we did U at t1.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I were already at 9, H=1, but I'm not.\n\nSo in this case, with one action U at t1, I can be at (0,9) at turn t1+1.\n\nBut I need to confirm that during turn t1, when I am on y=8, it is safe, which we thought yes.\n\nBut is it possible that moving to y=9 causes issue? No, because during turn t1, I am on y=8, and collision is only during the turn I am on the freeway.\n\nWhen I move to y=9, at turn t1+1, I am on y=9, no freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSo only need to check turn t1 on y=8.\n\nWe checked freeway 8 at t=18: cars on y=8.\n\nFirst car: (42,31,right,6), span [31,42] at t=18, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-6,-17,right,6), span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in H=2 with actions U then S, or U then anything.\n\nBut S at t1+1 is fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? No, since I'm at 9.\n\nBut H=2 is minimal, since I need to change from 8 to 9.\n\nBut with H=1, I can't reach, as above.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut let's see if I need to worry about other turns.\n\nPerhaps at turn t1, if I do U, but maybe on other freeways, but I'm only on y=8 at turn t1.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut let's double-check the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8: cars at t=18.\n\nFirst car: (42,31,right,6), since right-moving, span at t=18: left end tau=31, right end h=42, so [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-6,-17,right,6), head=-6, tail=-17, so for right-moving, span [tau, h] = [-17, -6] at t=18, 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a car that might come to 0 at some time? But for collision, it's only at the turn when I am on that row.\n\nSince I am on y=8 only at turn 18, and I leave to y=9 at turn 19, so only need to check t=18 for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I were to stay or move down, but I don't need to.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's see the other freeways; maybe I need to pass through them, but I'm starting at y=8, going directly to y=9, so no other rows involved.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so only y=8 matters.\n\nSo I think it should be fine.\n\nBut the car state has multiple freeways, but for this move, only y=8 is relevant.\n\nPerhaps for the action sequence, I need only one action, but with H=2.\n\nMaybe I can reach faster, but I'm already at 8, so going to 9 in one move is fastest.\n\nBut let's see if there is any constraint that prevents moving up immediately.\n\nFor example, if at turn 18, on y=8, it was unsafe, but it is safe.\n\nPerhaps the cars on other rows, but I'm not on them.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to y=9, I am not on any freeway during the move or after.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, I'm moving from y=8 to y=9 at turn T=18.\n\nAt turn T=18, I am on y=8, so cars on y=8 matter.\n\nCars on y=9 don't exist.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions: at t1=18, U; at t1+1=19, S (or D or U, but S is fine).\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify both.\n\nSince after reaching, it doesn't matter, but I have to provide H actions.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt1=18, so turn t1: action a_{t1}\n\nThen turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen position after H actions is y_{t1+H}, but we want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{t1+2-1} = y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I do only one action, H=1, y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=8≠9.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn t1, but I'm not, so impossible with H=1.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut let's see if I need to consider the cars for future times, but since I only stay on y=8 for one turn, and it's safe at t=18, I can move immediately.\n\nBut let's check if at t=18, on y=8, is there any car that has 0 in span.\n\nAs above, no.\n\nBut let's calculate the span for the cars at t=18.\n\nFor freeway 8, car 1: (42,31,right,6), span [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nCar 2: (-6,-17,right,6), span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see if at other times, but since I'm only on at t=18, no need.\n\nBut for example, if I stayed on y=8 for multiple turns, I might be hit, but I don't.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem has cars on other freeways, like y=1 to 7, but I'm not on them, so irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps the player could go down and then up, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H=2 with U at t1 and S at t1+1.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for t1+1, I can do anything, but S is simplest.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut let's see the car state; there is freeway 6 and 7 with cars, but again, not relevant.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, but at t=18 safe.\n\nPerhaps I should check if moving up is possible, but yes.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars.\n\ny=0 might have something, but I'm not there.\n\nIn this case, from 8 to 9.\n\nBut let's read the initial position: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8), so at (0,8) at turn t1.\n\nNow, I think I'm overthinking; it should be direct.\n\nBut let's look at the car speeds; some are high, like 36, but at t=18, on y=8, no car at 0.\n\nFor example, the first car on y=8 is at [31,42], moving right at speed 6, so it will move away, not towards 0.\n\nSimilarly, the other is at [-17,-6], moving right, so also moving away from 0.\n\nSo at future times, on y=8, 0 might be hit? But for example, the second car at t=18, span [-17,-6], moving right at 6 per turn.\n\nSo at time T, span [ -17 + 6(T-18), -6 + 6(T-18) ]\n\nSet left end <=0 <= right end for collision.\n\n-17 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -6 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -17 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=17 => ΔT <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so ΔT <=2 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -6 + 6ΔT => 6 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >=1.\n\nSo for ΔT=1,2.\n\nAt T=19, ΔT=1, span [ -17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt T=19, span [-11,0], so 0 is in.\n\nSimilarly, T=20, span [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=21, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=19 and 20, if on y=8, collision with this car.\n\nBut at T=18, not.\n\nSimilarly, for the first car, [31,42] moving right, left end 31 +6ΔT, which for ΔT=0 is 31>0, and increasing, so never <=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nOnly the second car can cause collision at T=19 and 20 on y=8.\n\nBut at t=18, I am on y=8, and I move away at T=19 to y=9.\n\nAt turn T=18, I am on y=8, safe.\n\nThen I do U, so at turn T=19, I am on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo I avoid the collision at T=19 on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I stayed, I would be hit at T=19.\n\nBut since I leave, I am safe.\n\nSo in this case, with U at t=18, I reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, for the sequence, H=2, actions: at t=18, U; at t=19, S.\n\nBut at t=19, I am on y=9, and I do S, which keeps me at 9, no issue.\n\nI could do U, but y=10? y max is 9, I think.\n\ny in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would try to go to 10, but y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so probably it stays or something, but the rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would be invalid? The problem doesn't specify, but it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I assume it is clipped or not allowed, but to be safe, I should do S or D.\n\nBut D would go down to 8, which is not desired.\n\nSince I want to stay at 9, S is best.\n\nIn the action, when at y=9, U or D might be possible but would not change position if clipped, but to avoid complication, S is fine.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, D might be invalid.\n\nBut here, at y=9, S is safe.\n\nSo sequence: Turn 18: U, Turn 19: S.\n\nNow, but in the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nAlso, H=2.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? No, as before.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn t1, but I start at 8, so no.\n\nUnless I was already there, but not.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut let's see the other freeways; perhaps I need to consider if I have to go through lower rows, but no, I can go directly up.\n\ny=8 to y=9 is adjacent.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the car state has multiple cars on other rows, but I don't care.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 has a car at [-24,11] left-moving, speed 36, so moving left, span at T: [-24 -36ΔT, 11 -36ΔT]\n\nFor collision at y=1, 0 in span: -24 -36ΔT <=0 <=11 -36ΔT\n\nFirst: -24 -36ΔT <=0 always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSecond: 0 <=11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/36<1, so only ΔT=0 possible.\n\nAt T=18, ΔT=0, span [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11]? -24<=0<=11, yes, 0 is in.\n\nAt t=18, on freeway 1, the car has span [-24,11], so 0 is included, so if I were on y=1 at turn 18, I would collide.\n\nBut I am on y=8, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, some might have cars at 0 at t=18.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: y=1, car at t=18: [-24,11], 0 in, so if on y=1, collision.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-24,11,left,36), so same, span [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nFreeway 3: cars (24,13,right,12), etc.\n\nFor freeway 3, at t=18, cars:\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12), so span [13,24] at t=18, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23, direction right, so span [tau, h] = [-23,-12] at t=18, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,12), span [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5, same cars? The state says for freeway 3,4,5 all have the same three cars? That seems odd, but according to the table.\n\nFreeway 3: cars (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, freeway 5: same.\n\nBut each freeway has its own cars, I think, so for each, we need to check.\n\nBut at t=18, for y=3, cars: first [13,24] no 0, second [-23,-12] no, third [-59,-48] no, so no car at 0 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly y=4, same.\n\ny=5, same.\n\ny=6: car (42,31,right,6), span [31,42] no.\n\ny=7: same car? Freeway 7: (42,31,right,6), same as y=6? Or different?\n\nThe table says for freeway 6: (42,31,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (42,31,right,6)\n\nSo same car? Or different instance? Probably different cars per freeway.\n\nBut for each, at t=18, span [31,42] for each, 0 not in.\n\ny=8 as before.\n\ny=1 and y=2 have cars at 0 at t=18, so if on y=1 or 2, collision.\n\nBut I am on y=8, so fine.\n\nNow, back to the point, for my move, only y=8 at t=18 matters, and it is safe.\n\nSo I think the sequence is simple.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), from (0,8), so directly up.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut let's see if H=2 is accepted.\n\nMaybe I can do it with H=1 by being there, but impossible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,8), and I need to go to (0,9), so one move up.\n\nBut with the turn count.\n\nPerhaps in the sequence, for H=2, the first action is at t1, to move to 9, and second action at t1+1, to stay or whatever.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: S }\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=18, so Turn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nThen Turn 19: a_{19} = S\n\nYes.\n\nSince after reaching, I can stop, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? For example, if y=8 was unsafe at t=18, but it is safe.\n\nIn this case, it is safe.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no cars.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but the collision is only if on the freeway and 0 in car span.\n\nBut at y=9, no freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2, with actions U and then S.\n\nBut to be precise, let's see the action sequence.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 18, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 18 are:\n- Car 1: \\((42, 31, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span at turn 18 is \\([31, 42]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- Car 2: \\((-6, -17, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span at turn 18 is \\([-17, -6]\\), which does not contain 0.\n\nSince 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 18, there is no collision at this turn. The player can safely perform the action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 18, moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so there are no cars and no collision risk. The player can perform the action \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions to reach (0, 9) at turn 19 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18 + 2 - 1 = 19\\)) requires \\(H = 2\\) turns. The actions are:\n- At turn 18: \\(U\\), moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19: \\(S\\), keeping the player at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nNo other sequence with fewer turns is possible, as starting at \\(y = 8\\) requires at least one move to reach \\(y = 9\\), and \\(H = 2\\) is the minimal number of turns to achieve \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{19} = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: S }",
