        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with direction L, which means it's facing left. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). That's a lot of obstacles; I need to visualize this.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since borders are from 0 to 7 inclusive. Let me sketch a mental grid.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7 (left and right walls), y=0, y=7 (bottom and top walls). So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nSnake is at (3,3), and it's just the head since it's a single position. Snake positions are given as [(3,3)], so length 1, no body yet. Direction is L, so it moved left to get here or is facing left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 10, value +1 (since it's positive, I assume, as value isn't specified but from context, it should be +1 for positive food)\n\nThe food is listed as (x,y, life_span, value). For (6,2,10,1), value=1, so positive. Similarly, (2,5,10,1) value=1, positive. (2,1,10,1) value=1, positive. All food here is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span is 10 for all, meaning they disappear after 10 turns, including current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n\nSince snake is length 1, eating food will make it grow to length 2. But with one segment, when it eats, it will grow, so the tail will be where the head was when it ate.\n\nBut currently, no tail.\n\nNow, I need to move. Current direction is L, so from (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since direction is L, reverse is R, so I cannot move right on the next turn. But since it's the first move, I can choose any except possibly the reverse, but reverse is only forbidden if I was moving in a certain direction, and I try to go opposite immediately.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) on this turn. So possible actions: U (up), D (down), L (left), or since no body, I could move in any direction except opposite? Let me read.\n\n\"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" — so for turn t, when I choose action, I cannot choose the opposite of the current head direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so opposite is R. Therefore, I cannot move R on this turn. So allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, from (3,3), moving:\n\n- U: to (3,4)\n\n- D: to (3,2)\n\n- L: to (2,3)\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to see free cells.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. But internal obstacles are separate.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nAlso, food at: (6,2), (2,5), (2,1)\n\nSnake at (3,3)\n\nNow, let's find which cells are safe to move to.\n\nFirst, for turn 0, from (3,3):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (3,4): is this safe? Check walls and obstacles.\n\n(3,4): x=3, y=4. Borders: x=0 or 7? 3 not 0 or 7. y=4 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6) — none at (3,4), so safe.\n\n- D to (3,2): y=2, not border. Internal: (4,1), (4,2) — (4,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) not listed, so safe.\n\n- L to (2,3): x=2,y=3. Not border. Internal: (1,2), (1,4), etc., no (2,3), so safe.\n\n- R is not allowed because opposite direction.\n\nSo all U, D, L are possible.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead to eat food and avoid dying.\n\nFood positions: (6,2), (2,5), (2,1)\n\n(2,5) and (2,1) are both at x=2, y=5 and y=1.\n\nAlso, (6,2) at x=6,y=2.\n\nSince snake is at (3,3), I should head towards food.\n\nBut I must consider the path and future positions.\n\nAlso, since snake is length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2, and I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nBut for now, no body.\n\nFirst, let's see the distances.\n\nTo (2,5): from (3,3), delta x=-1, delta y=+2, so Manhattan distance 3.\n\nTo (2,1): delta x=-1, delta y=-2, distance 3.\n\nTo (6,2): delta x=+3, delta y=-1, distance 4.\n\nBut (2,5) and (2,1) are closer in x, but y different.\n\nAlso, there are obstacles, so I need to find paths.\n\nMoreover, life span is 10, so all food will disappear after turn 10, but since current turn is 0, after 10 turns, at turn 10, it disappears? Life span decreases each turn including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now.\n\nFor food at turn 0 with life span 10, it will be there for turns 0 to 9, and disappear at turn 10? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t when food is present, life_span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including current, so it disappears at turn t + L.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, life span 10, so it is present from turn 0 to turn 9, and gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for all food, life span 10, so they last until turn 9.\n\nSince we are at turn 0, we have 10 turns to eat them, but need to eat before turn 10.\n\nNow, planning multiple moves.\n\nI should simulate possible actions.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (2,5) or (2,1) since they are closer.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which might be near obstacles.\n\nList obstacles again: internal at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), etc.\n\n(2,5) itself is not an obstacle, it has food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has food.\n\n(6,2) has food.\n\nNow, from (3,3), if I move L to (2,3), I'm at x=2, y=3.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) or (2,1) or elsewhere.\n\ny=3, (2,5) is up 2, (2,1) is down 2.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), to go to (2,5), I can go U to (2,4), then U to (2,5).\n\nIs (2,4) safe? Obstacles: (1,4) and (1,5) are at x=1, not x=2. (2,6) is obstacle, but (2,4) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is food, not obstacle.\n\nBut (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but they are at x=1, so (2,4) should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,1), from (2,3), D to (2,2), then D to (2,1).\n\n(2,2): obstacles? (1,2) at x=1, not x=2. (4,2) at x=4, so (2,2) should be free.\n\n(2,1) is food.\n\nNow, to (6,2), from (3,3), it's farther, and I need to go right, but current direction is L, so I cannot go R now, but later I can.\n\nFor turn 0, I cannot go R, but after moving, direction changes.\n\nLet's think about the sequence.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, and I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nBut since length is 1, after eating first food, length 2, head and tail.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (2,5), and I was at (2,4) before, then after eating, head at (2,5), tail at (2,4)? Let's see how snake grows.\n\nWhen snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and since it grows, a new body segment is added, but the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the previous position, so the tail stays until next move.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nAnd positions: head moves to new cell, and new segment is added at the position where head was, so tail is extended.\n\nBut for movement: when you move, head moves to new cell, and tail follows, meaning the last segment is removed if no growth, but with growth, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nSpecifically: when you move without eating, head to new cell, tail segment is removed. With eating, head to new cell with food, no tail removed, so new segment added, length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions: after move, if no eat, positions: new head, then previous positions except tail removed? Let's think.\n\nInitial: positions [H] for head.\n\nAfter move to new cell without food: new positions [new_H], but since no body, it's just the new position.\n\nWith length 1, moving to empty cell: new position is [new_H], same as before, no change in length.\n\nIf move to food: then positions become [new_H, old_H] because it grows, so now head and one body segment.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nIn this case, start with [ (3,3) ], length 1.\n\nIf I move to a cell with food, say to (2,5) and eat, then new positions: head at (2,5), and body at (3,3)? No.\n\nWhen I move from current position to a new cell.\n\nCurrent head at (3,3). I choose to move to a direction.\n\nSay I move to (2,3). If (2,3) has no food, then snake moves to (2,3), and since no eat, positions become [ (2,3) ], still length 1.\n\nIf (2,3) had food, I would eat, but it doesn't, food is at (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,3) is empty now.\n\nSo from (3,3), move to (2,3): no food, so new positions [ (2,3) ], direction now L (since I moved left).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to, say, U to (2,4), no food, so positions [ (2,4) ], then U to (2,5), which has food, so I eat, positions become [ (2,5), (2,4) ], length 2, head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,1) instead.\n\nOr to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) is farther.\n\nNow, I need to think about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut for now, tail is not present.\n\nAlso, food can be under body, but since no body, not an issue.\n\nNow, for multiple moves, I need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells for reference.\n\nBlocked cells:\n\n- Borders: all (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. But x=0 and x=7 are full columns, y=0 and y=7 full rows.\n\nIn the state, it says \"Cells occupied by walls: - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall.\n\nPlus internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nSo free cells are all others.\n\nFood at (6,2), (2,5), (2,1)\n\nNow, from (3,3), possible actions for turn 0: U, D, L (since R not allowed)\n\nIf I move L to (2,3): then at (2,3)\n\nThen from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction after moving left is L, so from (2,3), direction L, so cannot move R (east).\n\nPossible: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\n(1,3): is it free? x=1,y=3. Borders: x=1 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free? But (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,3) is not, so yes, free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) free, (2,2) free.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I go U to (2,4), then from there U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if go D to (2,2), then D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nOr other paths.\n\nIf I go to (2,4) first, then to (2,5).\n\nAt (2,4), no food, so after move, positions [ (2,4) ] if length 1.\n\nThen move to (2,5) with food, eat, positions [ (2,5), (2,4) ], length 2.\n\nNow, head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nNow, direction: after moving U from (2,4) to (2,5), direction U.\n\nNow, possible moves: U, D, L, R except reverse. Reverse of U is D, so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nBut U to (2,6): (2,6) is internal obstacle! (2,6) is in the list: internal obstacles include (2,6), so wall, cannot move there.\n\nL to (1,5): (1,5) is also internal obstacle, wall.\n\nR to (3,5): is it free? x=3,y=5. Borders? No. Internal obstacles? (1,5), (2,6), etc., (3,5) not listed, so free.\n\nBut cannot move U or L, only R to (3,5) or D, but cannot move D because reverse? Direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot move D.\n\nSo only possible moves: U, L, R, but U and L are walls, so only R to (3,5).\n\nMust move right to (3,5).\n\nThen at (3,5), no food, positions: head at (3,5), tail at (2,4)? Let's see.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5), positions [head (2,5), tail (2,4)]\n\nMove R to (3,5): head moves to (3,5), no food, so tail moves: the tail at (2,4) is removed, and new head at (3,5), so positions become [ (3,5) ]? No.\n\nWhen no growth, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so body segments shift.\n\nPositions: before move: [ (2,5), (2,4) ] head at (2,5)\n\nMove to (3,5): head to (3,5), and since no eat, tail (2,4) is removed, so new positions: [ (3,5) ], but that can't be right because length was 2, after moving without eating, length should be 2, positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ], because the body segment at (2,5) becomes the tail, and head at (3,5).\n\nStandard: the body follows the head.\n\nPositions list: head first, then body segments in order to tail.\n\nSo before move: positions [H, B1] where H=(2,5), B1=(2,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5), no eat, so B1 is removed (tail), and H moves, so new positions: [ (3,5), (2,5) ] because the previous head position becomes the new body.\n\nYes: the segment that was head becomes body, and tail is removed.\n\nSo here, after move: head at (3,5), body at (2,5), so positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nLength 2.\n\nDirection now R (since moved right).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move, etc.\n\nBut back to the point: if I go to (2,5) and eat, then I am forced to move to (3,5) because other directions blocked.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,1).\n\nLet's consider (2,1) first.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I move D to (3,2), then D to (3,1)? Or to (2,1).\n\n(3,2): from (3,3) D to (3,2), no food, positions [ (3,2) ]\n\nThen from (3,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nCan move U, D, L, R except reverse. Reverse of D is U, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) is internal obstacle! (4,2) in list, wall.\n\nSo cannot move R.\n\n(3,1): y=1, not border, not internal obstacle (internal at (4,1), (4,2), etc., (3,1) not, so free.\n\n(2,2): free.\n\nBut I want to go to (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), then D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), positions [ (2,1), (2,2) ] head at (2,1), tail at (2,2)\n\nDirection D (since moved down to (2,1)).\n\nNow, possible moves: from (2,1), direction D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,0): but y=0 is border wall, cannot.\n\nL to (1,1): is it free? x=1,y=1. Borders? x=1 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is at (1,2), (4,1) at (4,1), (1,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nR to (3,1): free.\n\nBut D is wall, so possible L or R.\n\nIf move L to (1,1), or R to (3,1).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nNow, the food at (6,2) is also available.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I move U to (3,4), then I can go to other places.\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) or to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is closer.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, I should consider which food to eat first and the sequence.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to survive and eat more.\n\nBut there are only three food, and I can eat all if possible.\n\nBut with obstacles, space might be limited.\n\nList all free cells to see the map.\n\nGrid:\n\ny=7: all walls (border)\n\ny=6: x=0,7 walls; internal (2,6), (4,6), (5,6) so cells (1,6)? x=1,y=6: borders? x=1 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7? y=7 is top, y=0 bottom. y=6 is not border unless y=0 or 7. Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so for y=6, only x=0 and x=7 are walls, but x=1 to 6 are free except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles at (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), so for y=6, x=1,3,6,7? x=7 is border wall.\n\nx from 0 to 7.\n\ny=6: cells (0,6) wall (border), (1,6) free? No internal obstacle at (1,6), internal at (1,2),(1,4),(1,5), not (1,6), so (1,6) free.\n\n(2,6) obstacle, (3,6) free? No obstacle, (4,6) obstacle, (5,6) obstacle, (6,6) free? No internal, not border, so free, (7,6) wall.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut I don't need all, just around.\n\nSince time is limited, I should aim for the closest food.\n\nBut (2,5) and (2,1) are both distance 2 in Manhattan from (3,3) after moving to (2,3) or (3,2), but directly.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,5): |3-2| + |3-5| =1+2=3\n\nTo (2,1): |3-2| + |3-1| =1+2=3\n\nTo (6,2): |3-6| + |3-2| =3+1=4\n\nSo (2,5) and (2,1) are closer.\n\n(2,5) is up, (2,1) is down.\n\nNow, moving to (2,5) might lead to a dead end as I saw earlier, because after eating, I can only go to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly for (2,1), after eating, I can go to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to other places.\n\nLet's see the map around (2,5).\n\nAfter eating at (2,5), I am at (2,5) with tail at (2,4), and must move to (3,5).\n\nThen at (3,5), positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ], direction R.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R except reverse. Reverse of R is L, so cannot move L.\n\nU to (3,6): y=6, not border, but (3,6) free? Internal obstacles not at (3,6), so free.\n\nD to (3,4): free.\n\nR to (4,5): free? x=4,y=5, obstacles? (4,6) but y=6, (4,1), (4,2) but y=1,2, not y=5, so free.\n\nBut cannot move L.\n\nSo possible U, D, R.\n\nThen I can go to other food, like (6,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) is far.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which is down right.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) was previous, might be free.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,1).\n\nIf I eat at (2,1), at (2,1) with tail at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen move to, say, R to (3,1), then positions [ (3,1), (2,1) ], direction R (since moved right from (2,1)).\n\nThen from (3,1), can move U, D, R (cannot L, reverse).\n\nU to (3,2): free, D to (3,0) wall, R to (4,1): but (4,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nL cannot, so only U to (3,2).\n\nMust move up to (3,2).\n\nThen at (3,2), positions [ (3,2), (3,1) ], direction U.\n\nThen can move U, L, R (cannot D reverse).\n\nU to (3,3), free, L to (2,2), free, R to (4,2) obstacle, so cannot R.\n\nSo move U or L.\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, the food at (6,2) is also there, and I can eat it later.\n\nBut life span 10, so I have time.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can eat multiple food.\n\nBut with obstacles, the space might be partitioned.\n\nLet's see if all areas are connected.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I can go to (2,3), (3,2), etc.\n\nTo (6,2): path might be (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2), but (6,3) to (6,2) down.\n\nBut from (3,3), I cannot go R directly, but I can later.\n\nAlso, obstacles at (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), etc., but (4,3) is free.\n\n(4,3): x=4,y=3, not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) free, (6,3) free, (6,2) has food.\n\n(6,2): y=2, not border, not internal, food.\n\nBut (6,2) is near border, x=6, y=2.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles not there.\n\nSo accessible.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all three food if possible.\n\nBut need to see the order and path.\n\nAlso, avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,5) first, I am forced to (3,5), then I can go down to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (4,5), then to (5,5), etc., to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,1), I can go to (3,1), then (3,2), etc.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating, the body grows, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nBut since grid is open, it might be ok.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (6,2) first, but it's farther, and I have to go right, which I cannot now.\n\nSo for turn 0, I should move towards the closer food.\n\nSince (2,5) and (2,1) are symmetric, but the obstacles are different.\n\nLook at the obstacles: near (2,5), there is (1,5), (2,6), (1,4), so the left and up are blocked.\n\nNear (2,1), there is (1,2), (4,1), (4,2), so down and right might be blocked.\n\n(4,1) and (4,2) are at x=4, not near x=2.\n\nAt (2,1), after eating, I can go to (1,1) or (3,1), but (3,1) then I can only go to (3,2), as before.\n\n(3,2) is free, then from there I can go U to (3,3) or L to (2,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly for (2,5).\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,1): when I am at (2,1), the tail is at (2,2), so if I move, the tail moves.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nI think both are feasible.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,5) first, then go to (6,2), then to (2,1), or something.\n\nLet's estimate turns.\n\nSuppose turn 0: move L to (2,3)  -- no eat\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4)  -- no eat\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5)  -- eat, now length 2, positions [ (2,5), (2,4) ], direction U\n\nTurn 3: must move R to (3,5)  -- no eat, positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ], direction R\n\nNow at turn 3, at (3,5)\n\nFrom here, I can go to (6,2).\n\nPath to (6,2): from (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,4) to (6,3) to (6,2), but that's long.\n\nShorter: from (3,5) move D to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), then R to (6,3), then D to (6,2).\n\nTurn 3: at (3,5), move D to (3,4) -- no eat, positions [ (3,4), (2,5) ]? After move: head to (3,4), body from (3,5) to (2,5)? Positions: before move [ (3,5), (2,5) ], move head to (3,4), no eat, so tail (2,5) removed, new positions [ (3,4), (3,5) ] head at (3,4), body at (3,5)\n\nDirection D (down).\n\nTurn 4: from (3,4), direction D, can move U, D, L, R except reverse. Reverse of D is U, so cannot move U.\n\nCan move D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\n(3,3) free, (2,4) free, (4,4) free.\n\nMove D to (3,3) -- no eat, positions: head to (3,3), tail removed, so [ (3,3), (3,4) ]\n\nDirection D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 5: at (3,3), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nCan move D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3)\n\n(3,2) free, (2,3) free, (4,3) free.\n\nSay move R to (4,3) -- no eat, positions [ (4,3), (3,3) ], direction R.\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (5,3) -- no eat, positions [ (5,3), (4,3) ], direction R.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,3) -- no eat, positions [ (6,3), (5,3) ], direction R.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,2) -- eat, food at (6,2), so eat, positions: head to (6,2), no tail removed, new segment at previous head (6,3), so positions [ (6,2), (6,3) ], length 3.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at turn 8, life span 10, so still there until turn 9.\n\nFrom (6,2), to (2,1), it's far, Manhattan distance |6-2| + |2-1| =4+1=5, but with obstacles, longer.\n\nFor example, move U to (6,3), but (6,3) is body, cannot, collision.\n\nPositions [ (6,2), (6,3) ], so (6,3) is body, so I cannot move to (6,3).\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (6,1): y=1, not border, but (6,1) free? No obstacle, so free.\n\nL to (5,2): free.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, cannot.\n\nSo move L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\nBut to go to (2,1), I need to go left and down.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\nFrom (6,2), move L to (5,2), then to (4,2), but (4,2) is obstacle! (4,2) internal wall.\n\nSo cannot go to (4,2).\n\nPath: from (5,2), can go to (5,1) or (4,2) wall, or (5,3) but (5,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 8, after eating at (6,2), positions [ (6,2), (6,3) ]\n\nMove to (5,2): head to (5,2), no eat, tail (6,3) removed, so positions [ (5,2), (6,2) ], direction L (left).\n\nThen from (5,2), direction L, cannot move R.\n\nCan move U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) obstacle, so cannot L.\n\nU to (5,3): free, D to (5,1): free.\n\n(5,3) is free, but in positions, (6,2) is body, not (5,3).\n\nSo move U to (5,3) or D to (5,1).\n\nSay move D to (5,1) -- no eat, positions [ (5,1), (5,2) ], direction D.\n\nThen at (5,1), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nCan move D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1) obstacle, R to (6,1) free.\n\nSo only R to (6,1) -- no eat, positions [ (6,1), (5,1) ], direction R.\n\nThen at (6,1), can move U to (6,2), but (6,2) might be free, but it was previous position, not body now.\n\nPositions: [ (6,1), (5,1) ], so (6,2) is free.\n\nU to (6,2), no eat, positions [ (6,2), (6,1) ], direction U.\n\nBut I am not getting closer to (2,1).\n\nFrom (5,2), if I move U to (5,3), then positions [ (5,3), (5,2) ], direction U.\n\nThen from (5,3), can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but body, cannot, L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but (6,3) was previous, might be free.\n\n(6,3) free.\n\nBut to go to (2,1), I need to go left.\n\nBut (4,2) and (4,1) are obstacles, so I have to go above or below.\n\nBelow: y=1, but (4,1) obstacle, so only x=3 or x=5, but x=4 blocked.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) move L to (4,3) -- free, positions [ (4,3), (5,3) ], direction L.\n\nThen from (4,3), can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2) obstacle, L to (3,3), R to (5,3) body, cannot.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nL to (3,3) -- no eat, positions [ (3,3), (4,3) ], direction L.\n\nThen to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut to (2,1), from (3,3) move D to (3,2), then D to (3,1), then L to (2,1), but (3,1) to (2,1) is left, but (2,1) has food.\n\nBut at this point, many turns have passed.\n\nTurn 8 at (6,2), then by turn 10 or so to reach (2,1), but food disappears at turn 10? Life span 10, from turn 0, so at turn 9 it is last chance, turn 10 gone.\n\nTurn 9: if I am at (2,1) on turn 9, I can eat.\n\nBut from above, it might be tight.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (2,1) first.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) -- no eat\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2) -- no eat, or D to (3,1) then L to (2,1), let's see.\n\nFrom (3,3) move D to (3,2) -- no eat, positions [ (3,2) ], direction D\n\nTurn 1: from (3,2), move L to (2,2) -- no eat, positions [ (2,2) ], direction L\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,1) -- eat, positions [ (2,1), (2,2) ], direction D\n\nTurn 3: must move to (3,1) or (1,1), but (1,1) possible.\n\nSay move R to (3,1) -- no eat, positions [ (3,1), (2,1) ], direction R\n\nTurn 4: from (3,1), only U to (3,2) -- no eat, positions [ (3,2), (3,1) ], direction U\n\nTurn 5: at (3,2), direction U, cannot D.\n\nCan move U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) obstacle, so U or L.\n\nSay move U to (3,3) -- no eat, positions [ (3,3), (3,2) ], direction U\n\nThen I can go to (6,2) or (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is still there.\n\nFrom (3,3), to (2,5): move L to (2,3), then U to (2,4), U to (2,5), but at turn 5, positions [ (3,3), (3,2) ], so (2,3) free.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (2,3) -- no eat, positions [ (2,3), (3,3) ], direction L\n\nTurn 6: move U to (2,4) -- no eat, positions [ (2,4), (2,3) ], direction U\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,5) -- eat, positions [ (2,5), (2,4) ], direction U\n\nTurn 8: move R to (3,5) -- no eat, positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ], direction R\n\nThen from here, to (6,2), similar as before, might not reach by turn 9 for (6,2) if I want to eat it.\n\n(6,2) last at turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 8, to (6,2): move D to (3,4) turn 8, then D to (3,3) turn 9, but at turn 9 I am at (3,3), not (6,2).\n\nTo reach (6,2) by turn 9, I need to move faster.\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 8, move R to (4,5) turn 8, then R to (5,5) turn 9, then to (6,5) or something, but (6,2) is at y=2, so from (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,4) etc, not to (6,2) by turn 9.\n\nTurn 8: at (3,5), move to (4,5) -- turn 8 positions [ (4,5), (3,5) ] if no eat\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5) move to (5,5) -- no eat, positions [ (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nThen not at (6,2).\n\nIf I go down, from (4,5) move D to (4,4), but not to (6,2).\n\nSo I may not be able to eat (6,2) if I eat the other two first.\n\nIf I eat (6,2) first, it might be better.\n\nBut from (3,3), turn 0, I cannot go right, so I need to go left or up/down first.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4) -- no eat\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), direction U (since moved up), so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\n(3,5) free, (2,4) free, (4,4) free.\n\nSay move R to (4,4) -- no eat, positions [ (4,4) ] if still length 1, but after move from (3,4) to (4,4), no eat, so positions [ (4,4) ], direction R.\n\nThen turn 2: move R to (5,4) -- no eat, positions [ (5,4) ], direction R\n\nTurn 3: move R to (6,4) -- no eat, positions [ (6,4) ], direction R\n\nTurn 4: move D to (6,3) -- no eat, positions [ (6,3) ], direction D\n\nTurn 5: move D to (6,2) -- eat, positions [ (6,2), (6,3) ], length 2, direction D\n\nThen at turn 5, I have eaten one food.\n\nThen I can go to (2,5) or (2,1).\n\n(2,5) and (2,1) both last until turn 9.\n\nFrom (6,2), to (2,5): |6-2| + |2-5| =4+3=7 Manhattan, but with moves, at least 7 moves, but I have from turn 5 to turn 9, 4 turns, not enough, since 4 moves only get to distance 4, not 7.\n\nSimilarly to (2,1): |6-2| + |2-1| =4+1=5, 5 moves, from turn 5 to turn 9 is 4 turns (turn 6,7,8,9), so 4 moves, can reach if path exists, but distance 5, need 5 moves, so on turn 9 I can arrive.\n\nTurn 5 at (6,2), turn 6 move to, say, L to (5,2), turn 7 to (5,1) or (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, so to (5,1), turn 8 to (4,1) obstacle, cannot, to (6,1) or (5,1) to (4,1) no, (5,1) to (4,1) L, but (4,1) obstacle.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 6, move D to (5,1) turn 7, then from (5,1) move L to (4,1) obstacle, or R to (6,1), or U to (5,2) body.\n\nSo move R to (6,1) turn 7, positions [ (6,1), (5,1) ] if from (5,1) to (6,1), etc.\n\nThen at (6,1), move U to (6,2) or L to (5,1) body, or D to (6,0) wall, so U to (6,2), but (6,2) may be free.\n\nBut not closer to (2,1).\n\nFrom (5,1) move to (4,1) not possible, so I cannot go left directly because of obstacles at x=4 y=1 and y=2.\n\nSo to go to (2,1), I need to go up to y=3 or higher, then left.\n\nFor example, from (6,2) turn 5, move U to (6,3) but body, cannot, or L to (5,2) turn 6, then U to (5,3) turn 7, then L to (4,3) turn 8, then L to (3,3) turn 9, then from (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1), but turn 9 at (3,3), move to (2,3) on turn 10, but food gone at turn 10, so on turn 9 I need to be at (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 9, if I am at (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (2,4), not to (2,1) directly, and (2,1) is at distance 1, but I need to move to it on turn 9.\n\nIf on turn 9 I am at a cell adjacent to (2,1), I can move to it.\n\nBut from above, on turn 8 at (4,3), I can move to (3,3) or (4,4), not to (2,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) turn 8, move L to (3,3) turn 9, then (2,1) is at (2,1), from (3,3) I can move L to (2,3) or D to (3,2), not directly to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is at distance 2 from (3,3), so I cannot reach it on turn 9 from (4,3) in one move.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,5), same issue.\n\nSo if I eat (6,2) first, I may not be able to eat the other food because of distance and obstacles.\n\nIf I eat the closer food first, I can eat both (2,5) and (2,1) but not (6,2) if I start with them.\n\nBut from (3,3), (2,5) and (2,1) are both distance 3, (6,2) distance 4, but with the direction constraint, (6,2) is farther.\n\nPerhaps I can eat one of the close food and (6,2), but not both far ones.\n\nSince (2,5) and (2,1) are at the same x, I can eat one, then the other, but (6,2) is separate.\n\nBut from the east side, it might be hard to reach west.\n\nAnother idea: eat (2,1) first, then (6,2), but (6,2) may not be reachable in time.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 9 for food.\n\nMax turns to eat: 9.\n\nIf I eat (2,1) on turn 2 as before, then at turn 2, positions [ (2,1), (2,2) ]\n\nThen go to (6,2).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,2): |2-6| + |1-2| =4+1=5, so 5 moves.\n\nTurn 2 to turn 9, 7 turns, so enough time.\n\nPath: from (2,1), after eating, at turn 2, head (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1) -- no eat, positions [ (3,1), (2,1) ], direction R\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2) -- no eat, positions [ (3,2), (3,1) ], direction U\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,3)? From (3,2), move R to (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove U to (3,3) -- no eat, positions [ (3,3), (3,2) ], direction U\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,3) -- no eat, positions [ (4,3), (3,3) ], direction R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3) -- no eat, positions [ (5,3), (4,3) ], direction R\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,3) -- no eat, positions [ (6,3), (5,3) ], direction R\n\nTurn 9: move D to (6,2) -- eat, food at (6,2), so eat, positions [ (6,2), (6,3) ], length 3.\n\nAnd (6,2) is eaten on turn 9, last possible turn.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (2,5) as well? But after eating (2,1), I went to (6,2), not to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), from (3,3) on turn 5, I could go to (2,5) instead of to (4,3).\n\nBut I have to eat (6,2) on turn 9.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) on turn 2 or 3, then go to (6,2), similar.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat all three.\n\nFor example, eat (2,1) on turn 2, then on turn 9 eat (6,2), but (2,5) is not eaten.\n\nTo eat (2,5), I need to go there.\n\nBut after eating (6,2) on turn 9, I can go to (2,5), but food gone at turn 10, so no.\n\nTurn 9 is last for food.\n\nSo I can eat at most two food: one from (2,1) or (2,5), and (6,2), or both (2,1) and (2,5) but not (6,2).\n\nSince (2,1) and (2,5) are both at x=2, I can eat one then the other quickly.\n\nFor example, eat (2,1) on turn 2, then from there go to (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,1), after eating, at turn 2, head (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nTurn 3: move to (3,1) or (1,1)\n\nIf move to (1,1) -- no eat, positions [ (1,1), (2,1) ], direction L\n\nThen from (1,1), can move U to (1,2), but (1,2) obstacle! (1,2) internal wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,0) wall, R to (2,1) body, cannot, so only possible if I move to (3,1) earlier.\n\nFrom (2,1) turn 2, move R to (3,1) turn 3.\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (3,2) turn 4\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3) turn 5\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,3) turn 6\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,4) turn 7\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5) turn 8 -- eat, positions [ (2,5), (2,4) ], length 3\n\nThen (2,5) eaten on turn 8.\n\nThen I can try to go to (6,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,5) turn 8, move R to (3,5) turn 8 -- no eat, positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ], direction R\n\nTurn 9: move to (4,5) or (3,4) or (3,6), but (3,6) free, but not to (6,2).\n\nTo (6,2) is far, |3-6| + |5-2| =3+3=6, cannot in one move.\n\nSo on turn 9, I cannot reach (6,2) from (3,5).\n\nSo I can eat both (2,1) and (2,5) but not (6,2).\n\nIf I eat (6,2) first, I can eat one of the others, but not both.\n\nFor example, eat (6,2) on turn 5 as before, then on turn 9 eat (2,1) or (2,5).\n\nSay eat (2,1) on turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 5 at (6,2), to (2,1) by turn 9.\n\nPath: turn 5: (6,2), positions [ (6,2), (6,3) ] after eating.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (5,2) -- no eat, positions [ (5,2), (6,2) ], direction L\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,3) -- no eat, positions [ (5,3), (5,2) ], direction U\n\nTurn 8: move L to (4,3) -- no eat, positions [ (4,3), (5,3) ], direction L\n\nTurn 9: move L to (3,3) -- no eat, positions [ (3,3), (4,3) ], direction L\n\nThen from (3,3), (2,1) is at (2,1), I can move D to (3,2) or L to (2,3), not to (2,1) directly.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) on turn 10, food gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,1) on turn 9 from here.\n\nSimilarly for (2,5).\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat all three food with the time and obstacles.\n\nTherefore, the maximum score is 2, by eating two food.\n\nEither (2,1) and (6,2), or (2,5) and (6,2), or (2,1) and (2,5).\n\nBut (2,1) and (2,5) are closer, so I can eat them both quickly and safely, and ignore (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), I can eat it with one other.\n\nBut since the snake starts at (3,3), (2,1) and (2,5) are symmetric, but let's see the obstacles.\n\nFor (2,5), after eating, I am forced to move right, while for (2,1), I can move to (3,1) or (1,1), but (1,1) might lead to dead end.\n\n(1,1): from there, only U, but (1,2) obstacle, so I have to move to (3,1) anyway.\n\nSo similar.\n\nPerhaps eating (2,1) and (2,5) is better because they are close.\n\nThen for turn 0, I should move towards them.\n\nSince current direction is L, moving L to (2,3) is direct.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go up to (2,5) or down to (2,1).\n\nBut I need to choose which one to eat first.\n\nSince life span is long, I can do either.\n\nBut to think ahead, after eating one, I need to go to the other.\n\nFor example, if I eat (2,5) first, then I am at (3,5), then I can go down to (3,3), then to (2,3), then to (2,2), to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet's plan the sequence for eating both (2,1) and (2,5).\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3), direction L, so move L to (2,3) -- no eat, positions [ (2,3) ], direction L\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3), direction L, cannot move R.\n\nCan move U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\nI can move U to (2,4) to go to (2,5)\n\nOr D to (2,2) to go to (2,1)\n\nSay I go to (2,5) first.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4) -- no eat, positions [ (2,4) ], direction U\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) -- eat, positions [ (2,5), (2,4) ], direction U\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5) -- no eat, positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ], direction R\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,4) -- no eat, positions [ (3,4), (3,5) ], direction D\n\nTurn 5: move D to (3,3) -- no eat, positions [ (3,3), (3,4) ], direction D\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,3) -- no eat, positions [ (2,3), (3,3) ], direction L\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,2) -- no eat, positions [ (2,2), (2,3) ], direction D\n\nTurn 8: move D to (2,1) -- eat, positions [ (2,1), (2,2) ], length 3, direction D\n\nThen I have eaten two food.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (2,1) first, similar sequence.\n\nFor (6,2), I can eat it with one of them, but since it's farther and time is tight for the second, eating both close ones is easier.\n\nIn this case, on turn 8, I eat the second food.\n\nLife span until turn 9, so (6,2) is still there, but I am at (2,1), far from (6,2), cannot reach in one turn.\n\nSo I don't eat it.\n\nScore 2.\n\nIf I want to eat (6,2) and one other, say (2,1).\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) -- no eat, positions [ (3,2) ], direction D\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2) -- no eat, positions [ (2,2) ], direction L\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,1) -- eat, positions [ (2,1), (2,2) ], direction D\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1) -- no eat, positions [ (3,1), (2,1) ], direction R\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2) -- no eat, positions [ (3,2), (3,1) ], direction U\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,3)? From (3,2), move R to (4,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove U to (3,3) -- no eat, positions [ (3,3), (3,2) ], direction U\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,3) -- no eat, positions [ (4,3), (3,3) ], direction R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3) -- no eat, positions [ (5,3), (4,3) ], direction R\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,3) -- no eat, positions [ (6,3), (5,3) ], direction R\n\nTurn 9: move D to (6,2) -- eat, positions [ (6,2), (6,3) ], length 3\n\nAnd (6,2) eaten on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, I could eat (2,5) instead of (2,1), but similar.\n\nIn this case, I also get score 2.\n\nBut with the first approach, eating both (2,1) and (2,5), I eat on turn 2 and turn 8, but the snake is at different positions.\n\nBut score is same.\n\nNow, for the initial move, since I need to move on turn 0, and I have to choose U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move L, I can go to (2,3), then to (2,5) or (2,1).\n\nIf I move D, I can go to (3,2), then to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly for U.\n\nBut to eat both close food, moving L to (2,3) is central.\n\nIn the sequence for eating both close, I moved L on turn 0.\n\nFor eating (2,1) and (6,2), I moved D on turn 0.\n\nBut both are possible.\n\nSince the question is to think 5 turns ahead, I should provide the actions for the next few turns.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to specify the sequence.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nFor turn 0, I need to choose the first action.\n\nPerhaps I should commit to a plan.\n\nSince long-term survival, but here no more food after these, so after eating, I just need to survive, but the game might continue, but no new food mentioned, so I can just stay alive.\n\nBut for now, I need to eat as much as possible.\n\nWith the obstacles, eating two is max.\n\nNow, for the first move, let's choose to go left to (2,3) to have access to both y=5 and y=1.\n\nThen from there, I can decide.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can output the actions for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the food life is 10, so 5 turns might not be enough, but I can plan the path to food.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can simulate.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacles, like (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), which block the left side, so moving to x=1 might be risky.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), if I move L to (1,3), then I can only move U or D, but (1,4) and (1,5) are walls, so U to (1,4) not possible, D to (1,2) not possible, only R back, but that might loop.\n\nSo better to avoid x=1.\n\nSimilarly, in general, stay away from obstacles.\n\nSo for turn 0, move L to (2,3) is good.\n\nThen turn 1, move U to (2,4) to go to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 2, move U to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 3, move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 4, move D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 5, move D to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 6, move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7, move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 8, move D to (2,1) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to list actions starting from turn 0.\n\nThe output should be for turn 0, turn 1, etc., up to some point.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the current turn and future turns as per plan.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence.\n\nSince the state is given at t1=0, I can provide actions for turn 0 to, say, turn 5 or more.\n\nBut to be precise, I should plan the path to eat at least one food.\n\nLet's decide to eat (2,5) first.\n\nSo for turn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen from there, I need to move to safety.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (3,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSimilarly, I can output for 5 turns.\n\nBut turn 2 I eat, so score increases.\n\nFor the sequence, I think moving L on turn 0 is fine.\n\nSince current direction is L, moving L is consistent.\n\nAnd it allows access to the food.\n\nMoving D or U also possible, but L is direct.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI will prioritize eating the positive food at (2,5) and (2,1) due to their proximity to the starting position (3,3) and the constraints of the grid. The food at (6,2) is farther and may not be reachable within its lifespan (disappears after turn 9) if the snake eats both closer food items first. Given the obstacles and the need to avoid dead ends, the snake will first move towards (2,5) to eat it on turn 2, then navigate to eat (2,1) on turn 8. The path is designed to avoid walls, obstacles, and collisions, with the snake growing safely after each meal.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current Direction (L)**: On turn 0, moving opposite (R) is forbidden, so actions are limited to U, D, or L.\n- **Food Lifespan**: All food has a lifespan of 10 turns (present from turn 0 to 9), so eating must occur by turn 9.\n- **Obstacles**: Internal obstacles (e.g., (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)) and borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) must be avoided.\n- **Snake Growth**: After eating, the snake grows by 1 segment. The tail position must be managed to avoid collisions (e.g., Tail Reward Danger is not an issue here as the tail does not have food).\n- **Path Safety**: The grid is analyzed for free cells; the chosen path avoids areas near obstacles (e.g., x=1 is risky due to multiple obstacles) and ensures multiple escape routes after eating.\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: The sequence plans beyond 5 turns to eat both (2,5) and (2,1) while keeping the snake alive. Eating (6,2) is not feasible with this path due to distance and turn constraints, so it is skipped to prioritize survival and achievable points.\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 0 to 8):\n- **Turn 0**: Move L to (2,3) – Directly towards the x=2 column for access to both (2,5) and (2,1). Avoids reverse move (R) and positions the snake for efficient food collection.\n- **Turn 1**: Move U to (2,4) – Advances toward (2,5); no food, so snake remains length 1.\n- **Turn 2**: Move U to (2,5) – Eat positive food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 2: positions [(2,5), (2,4)], head direction U.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R to (3,5) – Necessary to avoid dead end; U and L are blocked by walls ((2,6) and (1,5)). No food, snake moves: positions [(3,5), (2,5)], direction R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move D to (3,4) – Moves down to center grid; no food, positions [(3,4), (3,5)], direction D.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D to (3,3) – Continues down; no food, positions [(3,3), (3,4)], direction D.\n- **Turn 6**: Move L to (2,3) – Heads west toward (2,1); no food, positions [(2,3), (3,3)], direction L.\n- **Turn 7**: Move D to (2,2) – Moves down; no food, positions [(2,2), (2,3)], direction D.\n- **Turn 8**: Move D to (2,1) – Eat positive food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 3: positions [(2,1), (2,2)], direction D.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Score Maximized**: Eats two positive food for a total score of +2. Attempting to eat (6,2) would risk missing one of the closer food items due to distance and obstacles.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 8, the snake is at (2,1) with no immediate threats. It can move to adjacent free cells (e.g., (3,1) or (1,1) if safe) to avoid walls. The grid has ample space for further movement.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: The path avoids obstacles (e.g., no moves toward x=1 or near (4,2)) and prevents collisions. After eating (2,5), the move to (3,5) is forced but safe, and the path to (2,1) is clear.\n- **Efficiency**: The sequence uses minimal turns to eat the first food (turn 2) and positions for the second (turn 8), with all actions complying with movement constraints.\n\n### Final Actions (Turns 0 to 8):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 1: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 2: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 5: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 6: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 7: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 8: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current state is at turn 2. Let me understand the grid and the positions.\n\n**Grid Size**: From the walls, it says border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), meaning it's an 8x8 grid since x and y go from 0 to 7 inclusive.\n\nInternal obstacles are given: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. So these are cells I can't move into.\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(2,4)]. That's just one segment? That means the snake is only the head right now? Length 1. Let me check the food values; they are +1 each, so eating one will increase length.\n\nSnake head direction is U, which is up, so moving in the positive y-direction.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (2,5) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (2,1) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (5,1) with life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, so no negative food here. Life span is given; for example, (6,2) has life span 8 at turn 2, so it will disappear after turn 10, I think? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts until turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. But when it says \"disappears after N turns\", it might mean it exists for N turns starting from when it spawned. But here, the life span is given at current turn.\n\nFor food at (6,2), life span 8 at turn 2. That means it will disappear after 8 more turns, so at turn 10 it will be gone? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns\" – N is the life span value. \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". At turn t, countdown is C; at turn t+1, it's C-1, down to 0, and at turn when it becomes 0, it disappears. But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n\nLook: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to interpret: at the start, when food is spawned, it has life span N. Each turn, including the turn it spawns, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? But for movement, we care about whether it's present during the turn.\n\nSince we're making moves per turn, I think we should consider the food present as long as life span > 0.\n\nAt turn t, if life span is L, then after this turn, it decreases to L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears before the next turn or after? The rule doesn't specify exactly.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume that at the beginning of turn t, if life span is L, it is present during turn t, and at the end of turn t, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears and is not there for turn t+1.\n\nBut the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we have life span L, it means after this turn, the remaining life is L-1 for the next turn.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think: at turn t, life span value L means it has L turns left, including the current turn. So if L=1, it is present only for this turn, and disappears after.\n\nBut let's see the input: for (6,2), life span 8 at turn 2. So at turn 2, it has 8 turns left. After turn 2, it has 7 left, and so on, until after turn 9, it has 0 left and disappears, so it's present from turn 2 to turn 9 inclusive? Turn 2 to turn 2+7=9, since after 8 turns from turn 2, it's turn 10, but let's calculate.\n\nIf at turn t, life span L, then it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears before turn t+L.\n\nFor example, L=8 at t=2: present at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (8 turns), gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) L=8 at t=2, same.\n\n(2,1) L=8 at t=2.\n\n(5,1) L=9 at t=2, so present until turn 10? t=2 to t=2+8=10? L=9, turns: t to t+L-1 = 2 to 10, that's 9 turns, yes.\n\nt=2 to t=10 inclusive is 9 turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. But at turn 10, if L=1 at turn 10, it disappears after, so present at turn 10.\n\nBut for now, all food has high life span, so not disappearing soon.\n\nNow, snake position: only (2,4), so length 1. Head at (2,4), direction U (up).\n\nCurrent turn t=2.\n\nI need to choose actions for turn 2, turn 3, etc., up to at least turn 7 or more to think ahead.\n\nBut the answer format is to output actions starting from turn t1, which is 2.\n\nSo for turn 2 action, then turn 3, and so on.\n\nI need to plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid: 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\nList them:\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (4,2)\n\nSnake head: (2,4)\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\nSince snake is at (2,4) and direction U, moving up would go to (2,5). But (2,5) is a food position!\n\n(2,5) has food with value +1 and life span 8.\n\nIf I move up to (2,5), I eat the food, and since it's positive, my length increases to 2.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail reward danger. Currently, length is 1, so no tail. After eating, length becomes 2, but the tail is not there yet? Let's see.\n\nWhen I eat food, I grow immediately after moving, I think.\n\nStandard Snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nBut for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, no tail yet.\n\nSo moving to (2,5) should be safe and I get +1 score, length 2.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (2,4) direction U.\n\nSince direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be reverse.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (2,5)), L (left to (1,4)), R (right to (3,4)).\n\nNow, check if these are valid.\n\nFirst, U: (2,5) - is it wall or obstacle?\n\nBorders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. (2,5) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: list has (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), etc. (2,5) is not in obstacles list.\n\nObstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\n(2,5) is not there, and not border, so safe to move to. And it has food, so I eat it.\n\nL: left to (1,4) - x=1, y=4.\n\nIs it wall? x=1 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so not border wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4) is in the list! (1,4) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot move there. Deadly collision.\n\nSimilarly, R: right to (3,4) - x=3,y=4. Not border, not in obstacles list: list has (4,6), (1,2), etc., no (3,4), so should be safe, but no food there.\n\nSo possible actions: U to (2,5) with food, or R to (3,4) empty.\n\nCannot go L because (1,4) is obstacle.\n\nCannot go D because reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,5), I eat food, score +1, length becomes 2. Then the snake positions: head at (2,5), and tail at previous head? When I eat, the tail doesn't move, so after eating, positions should be [(2,5), (2,4)] or something.\n\nInitially, snake at [(2,4)], head only.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5) and eating, since length increases to 2, the body is added, but where? Typically, the tail stays, so positions become head at (2,5), and tail at (2,4).\n\nThen direction is now U, since I moved up.\n\nBut I need to think about the next moves.\n\nIf I go R to (3,4), no food, length remains 1, head at (3,4), direction now R (since I moved right).\n\nThen I can plan from there.\n\nBut going U seems good because I get food immediately.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nFood positions: (2,5) is close, (2,1) is below, (6,2) far, (5,1) also down.\n\n(2,1) is at y=1, which is low, since y=0 is bottom wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) at y=1.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), I am at (2,5) with length 2, tail at (2,4).\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nDirection is U, so from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5), cannot D (down) to (2,4) because reverse and also it's the tail, but since tail will move, it might be ok, but no instant reverse rule.\n\nFirst, check cells.\n\n(2,6): is it free? Internal obstacles: (2,6) is in the list! (2,6) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nL to (1,5): (1,5) is in obstacles list, so cannot move.\n\nR to (3,5): not in obstacles, not border, so safe. No food there.\n\nAlso, D to (2,4): but D is opposite to current U, so instant reverse not allowed. Even if allowed, (2,4) is the tail, but when I move, the tail will move away if I don't eat, but since I just ate, the tail didn't move when I ate, so now if I move, the tail might stay or move.\n\nI need to clarify movement.\n\nStandard Snake: when head moves to a new cell, if it eats food, tail doesn't move, so length increases. If not, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIn this case, at turn 2, if I move to (2,5) and eat, positions become [(2,5), (2,4)].\n\nThen at turn 3, I move from (2,5) to some cell.\n\nIf I move to a cell without food, the tail moves to the previous position, so head moves to new cell, tail moves to where the second segment was, but since only two segments, it's like the tail moves to where head was? Let's think.\n\nPositions: before move, head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nIf I move head to new position, say (3,5), and no food, then tail moves to (2,5)? No.\n\nThe body segments follow the head. When head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from positions [H, B] = [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nMove head to (3,5), then new positions: head at (3,5), and body at (2,5), since the body moves to where head was.\n\nSo now [(3,5), (2,5)].\n\nIf I had moved to a cell with food, then tail doesn't move, so new head position, and body stays, so length increases.\n\nBack to after turn 2: if I go U to (2,5), eat food, positions: [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nNow turn 3, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (2,6): but (2,6) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nL to (1,5): (1,5) obstacle, cannot.\n\nR to (3,5): safe, no food.\n\nD to (2,4): but reverse, not allowed, and also (2,4) is the tail, but since reverse not allowed, I cannot go there.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (3,5).\n\nThen I move to (3,5), no food, so tail moves to (2,5)? After move: head to (3,5), body to where head was, so [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nLength still 2.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is the body, but it's not the tail; the tail is at (2,5) now? Positions: head (3,5), body (2,5). So (2,5) is the second segment.\n\nIf I move L to (2,5), that's where the body is, so collision, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any body segment is deadly.\n\nU to (3,6): check if free. (3,6) not border, obstacles: list has (4,6), (2,6), (5,6), etc. (3,6) not listed, so should be safe? But y=6, x=3.\n\nInternal obstacles: (4,6), (2,6), (5,6), but not (3,6), so yes, free.\n\nD to (3,4): not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nR to (4,5): not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nL to (2,5): but (2,5) is occupied by body, so cannot, collision.\n\nSo from (3,5), can go U, D, or R.\n\nNow, food available: (6,2), (2,1), (5,1). (2,5) was eaten.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is down left.\n\n(5,1) at (5,1), down right.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), right bottom.\n\nSince I am at (3,5), which is top, y=5, x=3.\n\ny=5 is row 5, but grid y from 0 to 7, 0 bottom? Typically in coordinates, y=0 bottom or top? The movement U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n\nIn the state, it says U (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row.\n\nSimilarly, x from left to right.\n\nSo (3,5) is x=3, y=5, which is near top.\n\nFood at (2,1) y=1 bottom, (5,1) y=1 bottom, (6,2) y=2 bottom.\n\nSo all food is at bottom.\n\nI need to go down.\n\nBut obstacles in the way.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 choice.\n\nIf I go U to (2,5) at turn 2, then I am forced to go R to (3,5) at turn 3, as we saw.\n\nThen at turn 4, from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4), or U to (3,6), or R to (4,5).\n\nGoing U to (3,6) might not be good, since food is down.\n\n(3,6) is y=6, closer to top.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,5) is x=4,y=5.\n\nThen I can go down from there.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach food.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1, but there are obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), etc., so row x=1 has many obstacles.\n\n(1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, so x=1 row is partially blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) at x=5,y=1.\n\n(6,2) at x=6,y=2.\n\nNow, from (3,5), if I go D to (3,4), then y=4.\n\n(3,4) is free, I think.\n\nThen from there, I can go D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) might be tail or something, but in this path, after turn 3, positions [(3,5),(2,5)], so (2,4) is empty now, since tail moved.\n\nAt turn 3, after move to (3,5), positions [(3,5),(2,5)], so (2,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) free.\n\nSo from (3,5) go D to (3,4) turn 4.\n\nThen at (3,4), I can go D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), U to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, cannot.\n\nDirection after moving to (3,4) is D, assuming I moved down.\n\nFrom (3,5) move D to (3,4), so direction now D.\n\nThen possible moves: D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), cannot U (reverse).\n\n(3,3) free, (2,4) free, (4,4) free.\n\nThen I can go towards food, say to (2,4) then down to (2,3), etc., to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) has food.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1).\n\nBut are there obstacles?\n\n(2,6) is obstacle, but y=6, not low.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle at x=1,y=2, so near (2,2).\n\n(2,2) itself is free? Not listed as obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), etc., no (2,2), so (2,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free.\n\n(2,1) has food, but is it accessible?\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1).\n\nBut at (2,2), I need to go down to (2,1).\n\nNow, (1,2) is obstacle, but that's at x=1,y=2, not affecting (2,2) directly.\n\nBut (2,2) to (2,1) should be fine.\n\nThen I can eat (2,1).\n\nBut let's see the path from start.\n\nAt turn 2, if I go U to (2,5), eat food.\n\nTurn 3: must go R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4), I can go L to (2,4)  (since direction D, moving left is allowed, not reverse)\n\nFrom (3,4) direction D, move L to (2,4), which is left, so direction now L.\n\nThen positions: after turn 5, head to (2,4), body to (3,4)? Let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 2: positions [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5), no food, so tail moves to (2,5), so positions [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,4), no food, tail moves to (3,5), positions [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move L to (2,4), no food, tail moves to (3,4), positions [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nNow at (2,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 6: from (2,4), can go U to (2,5), but (2,5) is not occupied? Currently positions head (2,4), body (3,4), so (2,5) is free? Earlier (2,5) was body but moved away.\n\nAt turn 5 positions [(2,4), (3,4)], so cells occupied: (2,4) and (3,4).\n\n(2,5) is free.\n\nBut from (2,4), direction L, so possible moves: L to (1,4)? But (1,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nU to (2,5): not reverse, since direction L, moving up is perpendicular.\n\nD to (2,3): down.\n\nR to (3,4): but (3,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo can go U to (2,5) or D to (2,3).\n\n(2,5) has no food now, since eaten earlier? Food at (2,5) was eaten at turn 2, so no food there.\n\nSo go D to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (2,3), no food, positions: head to (2,3), body to (2,4)? After move: head to (2,3), body to where head was, (2,4), so [(2,3), (2,4)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 7: from (2,3), can go D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), cannot U (reverse).\n\n(2,2) free, (1,3) not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), no (1,3), so free. (3,3) free.\n\nThen go D to (2,2).\n\nTurn 8: to (2,1), which has food, eat it.\n\nSo by turn 8, I eat second food.\n\nBut this is after several moves.\n\nNow, what about the other option at turn 2: instead of going U, I could go R to (3,4).\n\nAt turn 2, from (2,4) direction U, go R to (3,4).\n\nNo food, so length still 1, head at (3,4), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: from (3,4), direction R, can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3), R to (4,4), cannot L (reverse).\n\n(3,5) free, (3,3) free, (4,4) free.\n\nFood at (2,5), (2,1), (5,1), (6,2).\n\n(2,5) is close, but I am at (3,4), so to go to (2,5), I need to go left and up, but direction is R, so I can go U to (3,5), then from there to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,5) is left, which might be against direction or not.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) first.\n\nTurn 2: go R to (3,4), no food, positions: head at (3,4), no body, length 1.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,4) direction R, go U to (3,5), no food, positions: head (3,5)\n\nStill length 1.\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,5) direction U? After moving to (3,5), direction is U.\n\nThen can go L to (2,5), which has food.\n\nMove to (2,5), eat food, length now 2, positions [(2,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen same as before, from (2,5), I can only go R to (3,5)? But (3,5) is now body, collision if I go back.\n\nAt turn 4, after eating (2,5), positions [(2,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,5) direction L? Moved left to (2,5), so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), but (2,6) obstacle, cannot.\n\nD to (2,4), not reverse? Direction L, moving down is perpendicular.\n\nR to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, collision.\n\nL to (1,5), obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (2,4).\n\nGo to (2,4), no food, so tail moves to (2,5)? After move: head to (2,4), body to where head was (2,5), so [(2,4), (2,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen similar to before, I can go down to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut I reached (2,5) later, at turn 4 instead of turn 2.\n\nIn first path, I ate (2,5) at turn 2, then by turn 8 eat (2,1).\n\nIn this path, eat (2,5) at turn 4, then go to (2,4) at turn 5, etc., so slower to get first food.\n\nMoreover, I have to go through (3,4) and (3,5) which are empty.\n\nSo better to eat (2,5) immediately at turn 2.\n\nBut there is another food, (5,1) and (6,2).\n\n(2,1) is also there.\n\nBut (2,1) might be risky because of obstacles.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (2,5), I am stuck at (2,5) with only one way out to (3,5), which is not efficient.\n\nBut I have to go that way.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating (2,5) at all and go for other food.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, go R to (3,4) instead of U.\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (3,3), etc., towards (5,1) or (6,2).\n\nFor instance, turn 2: go R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 3: go D to (3,3)  (direction R, move down)\n\nNo food, positions still head only.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3) direction D, go D to (3,2), or L to (2,3), R to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) free, I assume.\n\nThen to (3,1) or something.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n\nFrom (3,2), go R to (4,2), but (4,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (4,2) is in list! (4,2) is obstacle.\n\n(4,2) is wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) obstacle, etc.\n\nList: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\nSo (4,2) obstacle, (4,1) obstacle.\n\nSo from (3,2), if I go R to (4,2), cannot.\n\nGo to (4,3) first.\n\nFrom (3,3), turn 4: after turn 3 at (3,3), direction D.\n\nMove to (3,2), no food.\n\nThen positions head (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2) direction D, can go D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\n(3,1) free? y=1, not border, obstacles: (4,1), not (3,1), so free.\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nGo to (3,1), then I can go to (4,1) but (4,1) obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr to (2,1), which has food.\n\n(2,1) at x=2,y=1.\n\nFrom (3,1), go L to (2,1), eat food.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nTurn 2: (2,4) -> R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 3: (3,4) -> D to (3,3)  (since direction R, move down to (3,3))\n\nAfter move, head (3,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 4: (3,3) -> D to (3,2)  (move down)\n\nHead (3,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 5: (3,2) -> D to (3,1)  (move down)\n\nHead (3,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,1) direction D, can go L to (2,1) which has food, or R to (4,1) obstacle, cannot, U to (3,2) reverse not allowed, D to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo only L to (2,1), move to (2,1), eat food, length now 2, positions [(2,1), (3,1)]\n\nThen from there, I have food eaten, but now I am at bottom left, with obstacles around.\n\n(2,1) head, body (3,1).\n\nDirection L? Moved left to (2,1), so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, cannot, L to (1,1), R to (3,1) body, collision.\n\n(1,1) not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), no (1,1), so free.\n\nBut (1,1) is within bounds.\n\nGo U to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut I ate (2,1) at turn 6, whereas in first path I ate (2,5) at turn 2 and (2,1) at turn 8.\n\nHere I ate later but directly to (2,1).\n\nBut in this case, at turn 2 I didn't eat the immediate food, so score lower in short term.\n\nSince all food same value, getting one early is better.\n\nMoreover, after eating (2,5), I can still go to (2,1) later.\n\nThere is also (5,1) and (6,2).\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1, but (4,1) is obstacle, and (4,2) obstacle, so to reach (5,1), I need to go through x=5 or x=6.\n\nFor example, from bottom, (5,1) can be accessed from (5,2) or (6,1) or (4,1) but (4,1) obstacle, so from (5,2) or (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is x=6,y=1, not border? y=1 not 0, x=6, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is within, but x=7 wall, so x=6 is column 6, not wall cell unless specified.\n\nBorder walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=6 is not wall, y=1 not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) at x=6,y=2.\n\nInternal obstacles: (4,1), (4,2), etc., but (6,2) not listed, so free.\n\nTo reach (5,1), from above, (5,2) might be accessible.\n\n(5,2) not obstacle.\n\nBut (4,2) obstacle, so from (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1).\n\nSimilarly for (6,2).\n\nNow back to decision.\n\nAt turn 2, going U to (2,5) seems best to get immediate food.\n\nThen I have to go to (3,5), then from there, I can head down towards (2,1) or other.\n\nBut there is also the food at (5,1) and (6,2), which might be reachable.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's plan actions.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: but currently not applicable, since no tail with food.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no body, so not issue.\n\nSo for turn 2, I think going U to eat (2,5) is good.\n\nThen turn 3, must go R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,5), I have choices: U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,6): but y=6, top, no food, and (3,6) free, but going up might not be good.\n\nD to (3,4): down, towards food.\n\nR to (4,5): right.\n\nSince food is at bottom, going D to (3,4) is better.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (2,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to go to (2,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (3,4) go L to (2,4) as before.\n\nThen to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) has life span 8 at turn 2, so at turn 8, it might still be there? Life span 8 at turn 2, present until turn 9, since turns 2 to 9, 8 turns.\n\nAt turn 8, if I move to (2,1), it should be there.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\n(5,1) life span 9 at turn 2, present until turn 10.\n\n(6,2) life span 8, until turn 9.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut in the path to (2,1), I can eat it around turn 8.\n\nBut perhaps I can plan to go to (5,1) or (6,2) instead, which might be more efficient or safer.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), instead of going down, go R to (4,5) turn 4.\n\nThen from (4,5), direction R, can go U to (4,6), but (4,6) obstacle, cannot.\n\nD to (4,4), L to (3,5) body or not, R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is body if I came from there, but in positions.\n\nAfter turn 3: at (3,5) with body at (2,5)\n\nTurn 4: go R to (4,5), no food, so tail moves to (3,5), positions [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5), can go D to (4,4), U to (4,6) obstacle, L to (3,5) body, cannot, R to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) free? Not obstacle, not border.\n\n(4,4) free.\n\nGo D to (4,4).\n\nThen to (4,3), (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\n(4,2) obstacle, so cannot go down to y=2 from x=4.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) obstacle, but y=6.\n\nFrom (4,4) go to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,1) is at bottom.\n\nFrom (4,4), go R to (5,4), then down.\n\n(5,4) to (5,3), (5,2), but (5,2) not obstacle? Obstacles: (4,2), (4,1), etc., no (5,2), so free.\n\nThen (5,2) to (5,1), which has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) nearby.\n\nBut let's see turns.\n\nFrom turn 4 at (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: go D to (4,4)  (direction R, move down)\n\nPositions: head to (4,4), body to (4,5)? After move: head (4,4), body (4,5) if tail moved, but since no eat, tail moves to previous head position.\n\nPositions before move: [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nMove head to (4,4), then body moves to (4,5), but (4,5) is where head was, so new positions: head (4,4), body (4,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4) direction D, can go D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4), cannot U.\n\n(4,3) free, (3,4) free, (5,4) free.\n\nGo R to (5,4) to go towards (5,1).\n\nMove to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), body (4,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4) direction R, go D to (5,3), or U to (5,5), or R to (6,4), cannot L.\n\n(5,3) free, (5,5) free, (6,4) free.\n\nGo D to (5,3) to go down.\n\nMove to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (5,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,3) direction D, go D to (5,2), L to (4,3)?, R to (6,3), U not allowed.\n\n(5,2) free, (4,3) free, (6,3) free.\n\nGo D to (5,2)\n\nMove to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (5,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,2) direction D, go D to (5,1), which has food, eat it.\n\nSo at turn 9, eat (5,1).\n\nCompared to going to (2,1) at turn 8.\n\nBut in the first path, I ate (2,5) at turn 2, then (2,1) at turn 8.\n\nHere if I go to (5,1), I eat first food at turn 2, second at turn 9.\n\nBut I could eat (2,1) earlier.\n\n(2,1) is closer from starting point.\n\nIn terms of turns, from turn 2 to turn 8 for second food, that's 6 turns later.\n\nIn this path to (5,1), second food at turn 9, 7 turns later.\n\nBut I have (6,2) also.\n\nBut (2,1) is nearer.\n\nMoreover, in the (2,1) path, I might have risk with obstacles.\n\nAnother thing: at (2,2), I go to (2,1), but (1,2) is obstacle, but that doesn't affect directly.\n\nBut let's check if (2,1) is accessible.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1), all should be free except that row x=1 has obstacles, but x=2 is clear.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,1), from (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1), all free except (4,2) obstacle but not on path.\n\n(4,2) is at x=4,y=2, not affecting x=5.\n\nSo both paths possible.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating early is better, so going for (2,5) at turn 2 is immediate.\n\nThen for long term, I need to survive and eat more.\n\nThere is also (6,2) which I can go for later.\n\nBut since life span is long, I can plan.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns, at least 5 ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2, so I need actions for turn 2,3,4,5,6,7 at least.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, so plan for 5 moves or more.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can plan a sequence.\n\nNow, another consideration: if I eat (2,5) at turn 2, I become longer, which might make movement harder in tight spaces, but now grid has space.\n\nFor example, after eating, length 2, when I go to (3,5), then to (3,4), etc., it's fine.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 2, I can move freely with length 1, but I miss the food.\n\nBut the food at (2,5) will disappear after turn 9, but I can eat it later, but since it's close, better to eat now.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat, and go elsewhere, it might be gone when I come back.\n\nBut life span 8, from turn 2 to 9, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut to be efficient, eating now is good.\n\nSo I think for turn 2, go U to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 3, only choice R to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,5), I can choose to go D to (3,4) or R to (4,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nU to (3,6) is possible but not towards food.\n\nR to (4,5) towards other areas.\n\nD to (3,4) towards (2,1).\n\nSince (2,1) is closer in terms of y, and same x, I think D is better.\n\nGo D to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,4) direction D (since moved down), can go L to (2,4), D to (3,3), R to (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is free, as earlier.\n\nGo L to (2,4) to go left towards (2,1).\n\nThen turn 6, from (2,4) direction L (since moved left), can go D to (2,3), U to (2,5) but no food, L to (1,4) obstacle cannot, R to (3,4) body or not.\n\nAfter turn 5: positions before turn 5: after turn 4 at (3,4) with body at (3,5)? Let's track positions carefully.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5), eat, positions [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5), no eat, so tail moves to (2,5), positions [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,4), no eat, tail moves to (3,5), positions [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move L to (2,4), no eat, tail moves to (3,4), positions [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 6: from (2,4) direction L, can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3), R to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nL to (1,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (2,5) no food, D to (2,3) down.\n\nGo D to (2,3).\n\nMove to (2,3), no food, positions: head to (2,3), body to (2,4), so [(2,3), (2,4)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3) direction D, can go D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), U not allowed.\n\n(2,2) free, (1,3) free? Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), no (1,3), so free. (3,3) free.\n\nGo D to (2,2) towards (2,1).\n\nMove to (2,2), positions [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2) direction D, can go D to (2,1), which has food, L to (1,2), R to (3,2), U not allowed.\n\n(2,1) has food, so move D to (2,1), eat it, so tail doesn't move, length increases to 3.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), and body (2,2), (2,3)? After move to (2,1) and eat, new head (2,1), and body segments remain, so positions [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods by turn 8.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions up to say turn 7 or more.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead from turn 2, so for turns 2 to 6 or 7.\n\nActions: turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nThen turn 7: D to (2,2)\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 6 is D to (2,3), turn 7 is D to (2,2).\n\nBut at turn 7, from (2,3) to (2,2).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the plan, this seems reasonable.\n\nI could go for (5,1) or (6,2), but (2,1) is closer.\n\nMoreover, after eating (2,1), I am at (2,1), I can go to other food.\n\nBut for now, with the actions.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 4, I went D to (3,4), but I could go R to (4,5) to go to other area.\n\nFor example, to reach (6,2).\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 4 go R to (4,5)\n\nThen as before, to (4,4), etc., to (5,1) or (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) is at (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,5) go to (5,5), then (6,5), but y=5 high, need to go down.\n\n(6,2) is low.\n\nSo not direct.\n\nWhereas (2,1) is easier.\n\nI think the first plan is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: U (to eat (2,5))\n\nTurn 3: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 4: D (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 5: L (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 6: D (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 7: D (to (2,2))\n\nThen turn 8: D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut I need to output for current turn and next, at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn 2 to turn 6 is 5 actions: turns 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThat's 5 turns ahead from turn 2.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, so for turn 2, I think about turns 2 to 7 or so.\n\nBut output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 5 I go to (2,4), which is safe.\n\nBut is there risk? For example, at (2,4), when I move there, it was previously occupied, but now free.\n\nNo issue.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not applicable.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTo have a longer plan, I can include up to turn 7.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1.\n\nSo for turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nAnd perhaps turn 7: D\n\nBut turn 7 is not necessary, but since I have it.\n\nIn the state, there is food at (6,2) and (5,1), which I might go for later, but for now, this plan gets me two foods.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can be flexible.\n\nBut for the response, I need to output the actions.\n\nSo let's write.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 2):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (2,4), length 1, direction U (up).\n- **Food**: \n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (5,1): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 10).\n- **Walls/Obstacles**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).\n- **Constraints**: No instant reverse (cannot move down from current direction U).\n\n**Immediate Decision (Turn 2):**  \n- Possible moves from (2,4):  \n  - **U (to (2,5))**: Contains positive food (+1 score, length increases to 2). Safe, as no body collision risk (snake length 1).  \n  - **R (to (3,4))**: Empty cell, no score, length remains 1.  \n  - **L (to (1,4))**: Blocked by internal obstacle.  \n  - **D**: Reverse move, not allowed.  \n- **Choice**: Move U to eat (2,5). This gains immediate score and prioritizes survival (no risk). Thinking long-term, this food is easily accessible now and may be harder to reach later due to growing snake length or path constraints.\n\n**After Eating (2,5) at Turn 2:**  \n- Snake positions: Head at (2,5), tail at (2,4), length 2, direction U.  \n- Only safe move from (2,5) is R (to (3,5)), as:  \n  - U (to (2,6)): Blocked by obstacle (2,6).  \n  - L (to (1,5)): Blocked by obstacle (1,5).  \n  - D: Reverse, not allowed.  \n- Move R to (3,5) at turn 3.\n\n**Turn 3 State:** Head at (3,5), tail at (2,5), length 2, direction R.  \n- Possible moves:  \n  - **U (to (3,6))**: Empty, but away from food and high y-value.  \n  - **D (to (3,4))**: Empty, closer to low-y food (e.g., (2,1)).  \n  - **R (to (4,5))**: Empty, but may lead to dead ends near obstacles.  \n  - L: Reverse, not allowed.  \n- **Choice**: Move D to (3,4) to descend toward (2,1), which has high value and long life span. Avoids top area with fewer food options.\n\n**Turn 4 State:** Head at (3,4), tail at (3,5), length 2, direction D.  \n- Possible moves:  \n  - **D (to (3,3))**: Empty, continues descent.  \n  - **L (to (2,4))**: Empty, direct path to (2,1).  \n  - **R (to (4,4))**: Empty, but detour from (2,1).  \n  - U: Reverse, not allowed.  \n- **Choice**: Move L to (2,4) to align with x=2 for efficient path to (2,1).\n\n**Turn 5 State:** Head at (2,4), tail at (3,4), length 2, direction L.  \n- Possible moves:  \n  - **D (to (2,3))**: Empty, toward (2,1).  \n  - **U (to (2,5))**: Empty, but no food and away from target.  \n  - R: Reverse, not allowed (leads to body collision at (3,4)).  \n  - L: Blocked by obstacle (1,4).  \n- **Choice**: Move D to (2,3) to continue descent.\n\n**Turn 6 State:** Head at (2,3), tail at (2,4), length 2, direction D.  \n- Possible moves:  \n  - **D (to (2,2))**: Empty, direct to (2,1).  \n  - **L (to (1,3))**: Empty, but may lead to obstacle risks (e.g., near (1,2)).  \n  - **R (to (3,3))**: Empty, detour.  \n  - U: Reverse, not allowed.  \n- **Choice**: Move D to (2,2) to reach (2,1) in 2 more turns. (2,1) has life span 8, so it persists until turn 9, allowing time to eat.\n\n**Long-Term Survival (Beyond 5 Turns):**  \n- After turn 6, move D to (2,1) at turn 7 to eat (+1 score, length 3).  \n- Then, head to (5,1) or (6,2) via safe paths (e.g., via (3,1) or (4,3)), avoiding obstacles. Both foods have sufficient life span.  \n- This plan eats 2 foods by turn 7, with minimal risk. Alternative paths to (5,1) or (6,2) are longer and riskier due to obstacles (e.g., (4,1) and (4,2)).\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 2-7):**  \n- Turn 2: U (eat (2,5), +1 score, length 2).  \n- Turn 3: R (only safe move, avoid obstacles).  \n- Turn 4: D (descend toward (2,1)).  \n- Turn 5: L (align with x=2 path).  \n- Turn 6: D (continue descent).  \n- Turn 7: D (to (2,2), setting up for (2,1) next turn).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{D} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but with some internal obstacles. Internal obstacles are: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all wall cells to avoid.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), body at (2,5). So the snake is only two segments long right now. Head direction is R, which means it's moving right. Last move was to the right, so from (2,5) to (3,5).\n\nFood positions with value and life span:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nNow, since life span is given, and current turn is 4, I need to consider when food disappears. For example:\n\n- (6,2): life span 6, so it disappears after turn 4 + 6 - 1? Let me read the life span rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at the turn when it's spawned, life span is N, then each turn it decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nIn the input, food is given with life span at current turn. For (6,2), life span 6 at turn 4, so it will decrease to 5 on turn 5, 4 on turn 6, ..., down to 0 on turn 10, so it disappears after turn 10? Let's calculate:\n\nAt turn t, life span L means it has L turns left including current turn? Or after current turn?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on turn t, when food is present, life span L means after L turns, it will be gone. For example, at turn t, life span L: after turn t, it has L-1 left; after turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, it has 0, so it disappears at the start of turn t+L or something? I need to be precise.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think that at the beginning of turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for that turn, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know when it's available.\n\nFor simplicity, since the countdown includes current turn, at turn t, life span L means it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor (6,2) at turn 4, life span 6: available from turn 4 to turn 9 (since 4+6-1=9), disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): life span 6 at turn 4, available turns 4 to 9.\n\n(5,1): life span 7, available turns 4 to 10.\n\n(2,4): life span 10, available turns 4 to 13.\n\nAll have value 1, so all are good to eat.\n\nNow, snake is at [(3,5), (2,5)], head at (3,5), moving right. So possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse? No, instant reverse is not allowed only if it's the opposite direction immediately.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so I cannot move L on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n\nFrom the rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo at turn t, based on current direction, I cannot choose the opposite for the next move.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so for turn 4 action, I cannot move L (left), because that would be opposite to R (right).\n\nI can move U (up), D (down), or R (right).\n\nNow, grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each way, but walls at borders, so I cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nAlso internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\nList all wall cells:\n\n- Border: all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7. But since it's coordinates, e.g., (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7.\n\nBut internal obstacles are specific points.\n\nSo forbidden cells: all border cells and the internal ones listed.\n\nSnake head at (3,5), so possible moves from here:\n\n- U: (3,6) – but y=6, is it wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border, but check internal obstacles: (4,6) is wall, (2,6) is wall, (5,6) is wall. (3,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (4,6), (2,6), (5,6), but (3,6) not mentioned, so it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, D: (3,4) – check: y=4, not border, internal: (1,4) is wall, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nL: (2,5) – but (2,5) is current body position. But according to rules, I can move to tail because the tail will move away, so it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nR: (4,5) – x=4, y=5. Internal obstacles: (4,1), (4,2), (4,6) but (4,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nAlso, walls: (4,1) and (4,2) are walls, but (4,5) is different.\n\nNow, for each move, I need to think about safety and food access.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid mentally.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) – but corners are shared.\n\n- Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\n(1,4) is listed, and (1,5), etc.\n\nNow snake: head (3,5), body (2,5). After move, the body will follow.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the segment that was tail may leave a cell.\n\nIn this case, snake has two segments, so after move, the new head position depends on action, and the tail becomes the old head position? Let's see.\n\nPositions: [head, body] = [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nIf I move right to (4,5), new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5) – since the body moves to where head was.\n\nSimilarly, if move up to (3,6), new head (3,6), body (3,5).\n\nIf move down to (3,4), new head (3,4), body (3,5).\n\nIf move left to (2,5), but (2,5) is current body. Since the tail will move, if I move to (2,5), which is the current body, but after move, the tail moves away, so (2,5) becomes empty, and head is at (2,5), but since tail moves, it should be ok, no collision, because the tail leaves the cell.\n\nCollision only if head hits a body segment that is not the tail, or if tail is there but we eat food or something, but generally, moving to tail position is safe because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, since snake is short, moving left to (2,5) might be ok.\n\nBut current direction is R, so I cannot move left because it's opposite.\n\nCannot move L.\n\nSo possible actions at turn 4: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see the food locations:\n\n- (6,2) - bottom right, y=2, x=6\n\n- (2,1) - bottom left, x=2,y=1\n\n- (5,1) - bottom, x=5,y=1\n\n- (2,4) - left, x=2,y=4\n\nAll on the bottom or left side.\n\nSnake at (3,5), which is middle-left, y=5 is row 5, x=3.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Usually in grids, y=0 bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but in coordinates, often y=0 is bottom, but here walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is one edge, y=7 opposite.\n\nSimilarly for x.\n\nBut for movement, U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up, so likely y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo (3,5) is left-center, y=5 is above middle.\n\nFood at (6,2), (2,1), (5,1), (2,4) — all low y, so bottom area.\n\n(2,4) is y=4, which is closer to snake.\n\ny=4 is below snake at y=5.\n\nSnake at y=5, so down to y=4 or up to y=6.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's find a path to eat food without dying.\n\nAlso, consider the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows, and head collides with new tail.\n\nBut currently, no food under snake, I think. Snake is at (3,5) and (2,5), no food mentioned there, so probably no food under snake.\n\nFood positions are given, and not at snake positions, so ok.\n\nNow, for turn 4, I need to choose action.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,6)\n\nIs (3,6) safe? Not wall, no body, but after move, snake will be at [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nThen from there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut (3,6) is close to top, y=6, and walls at y=7, but y=7 is wall, so if I go to (3,6), next moves could be U, L, R, but U to (3,7) is wall, so cannot go U from (3,6). So only L, R, D.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\n- D: to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is free, I think.\n\n- R: to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) should be free.\n\nNow, which one to choose to reach food.\n\nNearest food: (2,4) is at (2,4), which is left and down from (3,5).\n\n(2,4) is x=2,y=4, snake at x=3,y=5, so to go to (2,4), I need to go left and down, but I cannot go left directly because of direction, so I need to go down first or something.\n\n(2,4) is adjacent? (3,5) to (2,4) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share x or y differing by 1.\n\n(3,5) to (2,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. So I need to move horizontally or vertically.\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (2,4), I could go left to (2,5), but (2,5) is current body, and I cannot go left because opposite direction.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to (2,4) from here.\n\nI could go down to (3,4), then left to (2,4) or something.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,1) is far, (5,1), (6,2).\n\n(2,4) is closest in terms of Manhattan distance: |3-2| + |5-4| =1+1=2.\n\n(5,1) is |3-5| + |5-1| =2+4=6, farther.\n\n(6,2) |3-6| + |5-2| =3+3=6.\n\n(2,1) |3-2| + |5-1| =1+4=5.\n\nSo (2,4) is closest at distance 2.\n\nBut I cannot go directly to it.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go down to (3,4), then from (3,4), I can go left to (2,4) or down to (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,4) to (2,4) is left, which might be possible depending on direction.\n\nAfter moving down to (3,4), the new head direction would be D (down), so I can move L, R, or D, but not U (opposite).\n\nFrom (3,4), to go to (2,4), it's left, which is not opposite to down, so I can move left.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (4,5), then I'm moving away from (2,4).\n\nIf I go up to (3,6), also away.\n\nSo to reach (2,4), going down seems good.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,4), life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nOther food has shorter life span? (6,2) life 6, from turn 4, available until turn 9.\n\n(2,1) life 6, until turn 9.\n\n(5,1) life 7, until turn 10.\n\n(2,4) life 10, until turn 13.\n\nSo (2,4) has longest life, so less urgent.\n\nBut all have similar value, so I should go for the closest or safest.\n\nBut let's consider the board layout with walls.\n\nList all wall cells to avoid:\n\nBorder walls:\n\n- x=0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)\n\n- x=7: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- y=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) — but (0,0) and (7,0) already included\n\n- y=7: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) — similarly\n\nInternal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\n(1,4) and (1,5) are walls, for example.\n\nNow, snake at (3,5), (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is not wall, but it's occupied by snake body.\n\nFor turn 4, actions:\n\n- U: to (3,6)\n\n(3,6): is it free? Not border, not internal obstacle (internal have (4,6), (2,6), (5,6), but not (3,6)), so free. But after moving, snake at [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nThen from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, and after move, if I go to (3,5), it might be ok if tail moves, but let's see: after turn 4, snake is at [(3,6), (3,5)] with head direction U (if I moved U).\n\nThen at turn 5, from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is internal wall, cannot move there.\n\n(4,6) is internal wall, cannot.\n\n(3,5) is current body position.\n\nIf I move D to (3,5), it is the body cell, but since tail will move, it should be safe, but after moving to (3,5), the new head is (3,5), and body is (3,6)? Let's trace:\n\nAfter turn 4 move U: positions become [(3,6), (3,5)] — head (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nThen at turn 5, if I move D to (3,5), new head (3,5), and body moves to where head was, so new positions: head (3,5), body (3,6)\n\nBut (3,5) was body, now it's head, and (3,6) is new body. No collision because the tail moved away from (3,5) when we moved to it? When we move head to a cell, if it was tail, and tail moves, it's ok.\n\nIn this case, from [(3,6), (3,5)], move D to (3,5): head moves to (3,5), which is the current tail position. Then the body (which is the old head (3,6)) moves to the new head position? No.\n\nThe body segments follow: the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where the head was, but head is moving to (3,5), which is the same cell.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: let S be the list [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move in direction, new head is head + direction, then new positions: [new_head, old_head, seg1, ..., except the tail is removed if no food, but with food, tail grows.\n\nCurrently no food eaten, so when moving, head moves to new position, and tail position is removed.\n\nSo for two-segment snake: positions [head, tail]\n\nAfter move, new head position = head + move, and new tail position = old head position.\n\nSo the cell of old tail is freed.\n\nIf I move to the old tail position, it is free when I move there.\n\nIn this case, from [(3,5), (2,5)] at turn 4.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), new positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5) — so (2,5) is freed.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (2,5), which is the current tail, new head would be (2,5), new tail (3,5), so the cell (2,5) is occupied by new head, but it was freed when tail moved.\n\nBack to (3,6): from there, at turn 5, head at (3,6), tail at (3,5).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,7) — wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) — (3,5) is current tail position. Moving to it: new head (3,5), new tail (3,6). Since (3,5) was tail, and tail moves, it should be safe, no collision.\n\nL to (2,6) — but (2,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nR to (4,6) — (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move from (3,6) is D to (3,5), which brings me back to where I was, essentially looping.\n\nBut after moving D, I'm at (3,5) with tail at (3,6), so positions [(3,5), (3,6)]\n\nThen from there, I can move, say, D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) or R to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut from (3,6), only D is possible, which is not good, as I'm stuck with only one move.\n\nTherefore, moving U at turn 4 is bad because it leads to a dead end or limited options.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (3,6) is risky because I can only go down from there, and I might be trapped.\n\nSo U is not a good choice.\n\nNow, move D to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free? Not border, not internal obstacle. Internal: (1,4) is wall, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nAfter move D, new positions: head (3,4), tail (3,5) — so body at (3,5).\n\nHead direction now D.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) — which is current body, but can move there since tail will move.\n\nL to (2,4) — (2,4) is food position.\n\nR to (4,4) — (4,4) should be free, no wall.\n\nD to (3,3) — down, etc.\n\nAlso, (2,4) has food, I can eat it if I move there.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\n(2,4) is not wall, and no body there.\n\nIf I move L to (2,4), I eat the food, since it's positive, snake grows, so after eating, positions: new head at (2,4), and since I ate, tail doesn't move away, so new body segments: the old tail position is added, so snake becomes [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,5) ] — head at (2,4), then the previous head (3,4) is now body, and (3,5) is tail.\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Tail reward danger: but here, when I eat at (2,4), the tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,4)? (2,4) and (3,5) are not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y diff 1.\n\n(2,4) and (3,5) differ in both x and y, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nAfter eating, I'm at (2,4), with body at (3,4) and (3,5).\n\nNow, head direction would be L (since I moved left).\n\nPossible next moves from (2,4).\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 4, if I move D to (3,4), then on turn 5 I can move to (2,4) to eat.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns.\n\nMove R to (4,5) at turn 4.\n\n(4,5) is free? Not border, internal: (4,1), (4,2), (4,6) walls, but (4,5) not, so free.\n\nAfter move R, new positions: head (4,5), tail (3,5) — (2,5) freed.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) — but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (4,4) — (4,4) should be free.\n\nL to (3,5) — (3,5) is current tail position, can move there.\n\nR to (5,5) — (5,5) should be free, no wall mentioned.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6) is wall, but (5,5) not, so free.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can go D, L, or R.\n\nBut U is blocked by wall.\n\nNow, food is mostly left and bottom, so moving right might take me away, but there is food at (5,1) and (6,2).\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1, so from (4,5), I need to go down.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is further.\n\nBut life span: (5,1) life 7, available until turn 10, so time.\n\n(6,2) until turn 9.\n\n(2,4) until turn 13.\n\nBut (2,4) is closer to current position.\n\nNow, back to turn 4 actions.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), I can then go to (2,4) on turn 5 to eat food.\n\nIf I move R, I might not get food soon.\n\nBut let's think about the board with walls, there might be obstacles.\n\nFor example, to reach (2,4) from (3,5), moving D to (3,4) is direct.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (2,4) on turn 5.\n\nBut at turn 5, when I move to (2,4), I eat the food, snake grows to length 3.\n\nThen I need to think where to go next.\n\nFood left: (6,2), (2,1), (5,1) — (2,4) eaten.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is below (2,4), but there is a wall at (1,2), (1,4), etc.\n\nAlso, (1,5) wall, so left side has walls.\n\nSpecifically, at x=1, y=2,4,5 are walls, so (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) walls.\n\nSo column x=1 has walls at y=2,4,5, but other y might be free? y=1,3,6,7? But y=0 and y=7 walls, so for x=1, cells: (1,0) border wall, (1,1) ? not listed, (1,2) wall, (1,3) not listed, (1,4) wall, (1,5) wall, (1,6) not listed, (1,7) border wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1), (1,3), (1,6) might be free, but (1,6) y=6, not border, but internal not listed, so free.\n\nBut for now, from (2,4), after eating, I can go to adjacent cells.\n\n(2,4) neighbors:\n\n- U: (2,5) — but (2,5) was previous position? After eating at turn 5, positions: head at (2,4), body at (3,4), tail at (3,5)\n\nSo (2,5) is free now.\n\n(2,5) is not wall? (1,5) is wall, but (2,5) not listed, so free.\n\n- D: (2,3) — should be free\n\n- L: (1,4) — but (1,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot\n\n- R: (3,4) — but (3,4) is current body position, can move there since tail will move, but it's occupied now.\n\nAfter move to (2,4), head direction L.\n\nThen at turn 6, from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5), D to (2,3), or R to (3,4), but not L to (1,4) wall.\n\n(3,4) is body, but can move to it.\n\nIf I move to (3,4), which is body, it might be safe, but let's see.\n\nTo reach other food, like (2,1), I need to go down from (2,4).\n\n(2,1) is at y=1, so down.\n\nBut there is wall at (1,2), (1,4), etc., but not directly blocking.\n\nFrom (2,4), go D to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (2,1), but (2,2) is free? Not wall.\n\n(1,2) is wall, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) not wall.\n\nBut (2,1) is food, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n\nNow, if I go to (2,4) and eat, I have a longer snake, which might be harder to maneuver, but currently only length 3 after eating.\n\nBut let's consider the R move at turn 4.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5) at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 5, from (4,5), head at (4,5), tail at (3,5).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6) wall, invalid; D to (4,4); L to (3,5); R to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\n(3,5) is tail, can move to it.\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nNow, food at (5,1), I can go down.\n\nFor example, go D to (4,4), then D to (4,3), etc., to (5,1) or something.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1, so from (4,4), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut (5,1) is directly below? No, (4,4) to (5,1) not adjacent.\n\nPath: from (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1), for example.\n\n(5,2) free? Not wall.\n\n(5,1) free.\n\nBut life span of (5,1) is 7, available until turn 10, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) can be reached.\n\nBut (2,4) might be eaten by then or not.\n\nSince no other snake, I can go for it later.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eat as much as possible.\n\nBut prioritize survival.\n\nNow, another thing: moving U at turn 4 is bad, as we saw, leads to dead end.\n\nSo between D and R, D seems better to reach (2,4) quickly.\n\nMoreover, (2,4) has long life span, but eating it soon gives me a longer snake, which might help in reaching other food or blocking, but here no other snake, so just for score.\n\nBut with longer snake, I have more body to avoid, so it might be riskier in tight spaces.\n\nCurrently, the board has many walls, so I need to be careful.\n\nLet me sketch a small grid.\n\nLet me list rows from y=7 top to y=0 bottom, x from 0 to 7 left to right.\n\ny=7: all wall (border)\n\ny=6: x=0 wall, x=7 wall, and internal walls at (1,6)? No, internal: (4,6), (2,6), (5,6), and (1,5) but y=5.\n\nFor y=6: border x=0 and x=7 walls, and cells: (1,6) not listed, but internal obstacles include (2,6) and (4,6) and (5,6), so (1,6), (3,6), (6,6) might be free? (6,6) x=6,y=6, not border, not internal listed, so free.\n\nBut let's list free cells or walls.\n\nSince time, I should decide.\n\nPerhaps for turn 4, moving D to (3,4) is good, as it allows me to eat (2,4) on turn 5.\n\nThen on turn 5, eat (2,4), snake to length 3.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go down to (2,3) or up to (2,5) or right to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is body, so if I go right, to (3,4), which is body, but after moving, since I ate food last turn, tail didn't move, so (3,4) is still body, not tail.\n\nAfter eating at turn 5, positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), tail (3,5)\n\nAt turn 6, if I move R to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail; tail is at (3,5).\n\nMoving to a body cell that is not tail causes collision, death.\n\nCannot move to (3,4) because it's body segment.\n\nSimilarly, I can only move to free cells or tail cell.\n\nHere, from (2,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,5): free cell, not wall, not occupied.\n\nD to (2,3): free, assume.\n\nL to (1,4): wall, invalid.\n\nR to (3,4): body, invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (2,5), then positions: new head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4)? After move, head to (2,5), body segments move: the segment at (3,4) moves to (2,4), and tail at (3,5) moves to (3,4)? Let's trace positions.\n\nBefore move turn 6: snake [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,5) ] head to tail.\n\nMove U to (2,5): new head (2,5)\n\nThen body: the first body segment (3,4) moves to where head was, (2,4)\n\nThen tail (3,5) moves to where the first body was, (3,4)\n\nSo new positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move U, D, L, R but L to (1,5) is wall (internal obstacle), R to (3,5) — (3,5) is now (3,4)? (3,5) is free now? After move, (3,5) is not occupied, since tail moved to (3,4).\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nBut (3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,6): but (2,6) is internal wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,4): (2,4) is current body position. Moving to it: if I move D to (2,4), which is body, not tail, so collision, invalid. Cannot move to body cell.\n\nL to (1,5): wall, invalid.\n\nR to (3,5): free, can move.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (3,5).\n\nThen go to (3,5), and so on.\n\nBut (3,5) is where I was earlier.\n\nNot much progress.\n\nFrom (2,4) after eating, if I go D to (2,3) on turn 6.\n\nThen positions: new head (2,3), body (2,4), tail (3,4)? Before move: [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nMove D to (2,3): new head (2,3)\n\nBody: (3,4) moves to (2,4)\n\n(3,5) moves to (3,4)\n\nNew positions: [ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,2), (2,4), or (3,3), etc.\n\n(2,4) is body, cannot go there.\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) not wall? Internal walls: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,3) not listed, so free.\n\nR to (3,3): free.\n\nD to (2,2): free.\n\nU to (2,4): body, invalid.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can go L to (1,3), D to (2,2), or R to (3,3).\n\nThen I can go down to (2,1) to eat that food.\n\n(2,1) is food, at y=1.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut back to turn 4 decision.\n\nIf I move R at turn 4 to (4,5), I might go for (5,1) or (6,2).\n\nFor example, from (4,5), move D to (4,4) on turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,4), move D to (4,3), and so on to (4,1) but (4,1) is wall, cannot.\n\n(4,1) is internal wall, so I cannot go to y=1 at x=4.\n\nTo reach (5,1), I need to go to x=5 first.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move R to (5,4), then D to (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n\nPath: (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1).\n\n(5,2) free? Not wall.\n\n(5,1) free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) from (5,2) or something.\n\nBut life span: (5,1) life 7, so if I start moving now, from turn 4 at (3,5), move R to (4,5) turn 4, then turn 5 to (4,4) or (5,5), say to (5,5) if I go R.\n\nFrom (4,5), move R to (5,5) turn 5.\n\nThen from (5,5), move D to (5,4) turn 6, then to (5,3) turn 7, to (5,2) turn 8, to (5,1) turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I eat (5,1), life span 7 at turn 4, available until turn 10? Life span 7 at turn 4, so on turn 4, L=7, turn 5 L=6, ..., turn 10 L=1, turn 11 L=0, disappears, so available turns 4 to 10.\n\nTurn 9 is within, so I can eat on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,4) sooner.\n\nAt turn 4 move D to (3,4), turn 5 move L to (2,4) eat, on turn 5.\n\nThen I have food eaten earlier.\n\nBut after eating (2,4), I might be in a position where it's harder to reach other food because of walls.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), to go to (5,1), I need to go right and down, but there are walls at x=1 and x=4? Not directly.\n\nFrom (2,3) or something.\n\nBut I can also eat (2,1) which is closer.\n\n(2,1) at (2,1), life span 6, available until turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go down to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) by turn 7 or so.\n\nTurn 5: at (2,4) after eat.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (2,1) eat.\n\nSo eat on turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (5,1) later.\n\nBut both are possible.\n\nNow, the risk: moving to (3,6) is bad, as we saw.\n\nMoving D seems safer for short term.\n\nBut let's think about long-term survival.\n\nThe board has many obstacles, so I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nFor example, the top row y=6 has walls at (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), so only (3,6), (6,6) might be free, but (6,6) is free, but from (3,6) only down, etc.\n\nBottom, y=1 has (4,1) wall, but (5,1) food, etc.\n\nAlso, (1,2) wall, etc.\n\nPerhaps the area around (2,4) is relatively open.\n\nSince all food is positive, and I need to eat, but avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but currently not, so no issue.\n\nTail reward danger: not applicable now.\n\nSo for turn 4, I think moving D to (3,4) is a good choice, then I can eat (2,4) on turn 5.\n\nThen for turn 5, move L to (2,4) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 6, from (2,4), I can move D to (2,3) to head towards (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, I can plan multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be actions for several turns.\n\nBut the format is to output actions for turns starting from t1=4.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=4, so actions for turn 4,5,6,7,8 at least.\n\nBut I can output more if needed, but 5 turns should be fine.\n\nSo let's plan a sequence.\n\nStart: turn 4, at (3,5), direction R.\n\nAction for turn 4: D to (3,4)\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), tail (3,5) — body at (3,5)\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4), move L to (2,4) to eat food.\n\nSince (2,4) has food, I eat it.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), and since eaten, tail doesn't move, so body: (3,4) and (3,5) — so [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nDirection left (since moved left).\n\nNow turn 6: from (2,4), possible moves: U, D, R (L is wall)\n\nU to (2,5): free, as (2,5) is not occupied.\n\nD to (2,3): free.\n\nR to (3,4): but (3,4) is body, not tail, so cannot, collision.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nI need to go down to reach (2,1), so move D to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), body moves: (3,4) to (2,4), (3,5) to (3,4) — new positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,4): body, invalid\n\nD to (2,2): free\n\nL to (1,3): free? (1,3) not wall, yes.\n\nR to (3,3): free\n\nI can go D to (2,2) to continue to (2,1).\n\nMove D to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), body: (2,4) to (2,3)? Positions: before move [ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nMove D to (2,2): new head (2,2)\n\nBody: the segment at (2,4) moves to (2,3)\n\nThe segment at (3,4) moves to (2,4)\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ]\n\nDirection down.\n\n(3,4) moved to (2,4), so tail at (2,4).\n\nNow turn 8: from (2,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,3): body, invalid\n\nD to (2,1): (2,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nL to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nR to (3,2): free? Not wall.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2)\n\nI can go D to (2,1) to eat the food.\n\nMove D to (2,1), eat food, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) — since eaten, tail doesn't move, so [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ]\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods, snake length 4.\n\nBut I might be in a vertical line at x=2, from y=1 to y=4.\n\nFrom here, I need to move out.\n\nPossible moves from (2,1): U to (2,2) body, invalid; D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; L to (1,1): free? (1,1) not wall; R to (3,1): free.\n\n(1,1) is not wall, since walls are (1,2), etc., but (1,1) should be free.\n\nSimilarly (3,1) free.\n\nSo I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nBut this is turn 8, and I need to plan up to turn 9 or so.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify actions for turns starting from 4.\n\nIn this sequence, I have turns 4 to 8.\n\nBut turn 8 is eating (2,1), but I need to go beyond.\n\nPerhaps I can output for 5 turns: turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: D to (2,1)\n\nBut on turn 8, I eat, then I need to move, but for the plan, it might be fine.\n\nI could consider moving R at some point to avoid being stuck.\n\nIn this sequence, after turn 8, I'm at (2,1) with snake vertical, so I must move left or right.\n\nBut let's see if this is optimal.\n\nIf at turn 4 I move R to (4,5), then I might go for (5,1).\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5)\n\nPositions: head (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), L to (3,5), or R to (5,5)\n\nSay move R to (5,5) to go towards (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5), move D to (5,4) (since (5,6) is wall, U invalid)\n\nD to (5,4)\n\nNew head (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4), move D to (5,3)\n\nNew head (5,3), tail (5,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,3), move D to (5,2)\n\nNew head (5,2), tail (5,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,2), move D to (5,1) to eat food.\n\nEat (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) — since length increases.\n\nBefore move, at turn 9, positions [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 8: positions [ (5,2), (5,3) ]? No.\n\nTurn 4: after move to (4,5), positions [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5), new positions [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 6: move D to (5,4), new positions [(5,4), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,3), new positions [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,2), new positions [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nThen turn 9: move D to (5,1), eat, so new positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), and since eaten, tail not moved, so the previous tail (5,3) is still there, so positions [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen I can go to (6,2) or something.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (5,1) on turn 9.\n\nCompared to the first sequence, I ate (2,4) on turn 5 and (2,1) on turn 8, so two foods by turn 8.\n\nIn this sequence, only one food by turn 9.\n\nAlso, (2,4) might expire later, but I ate it early.\n\nIn terms of score, eating sooner might be better, but since all value 1, and I can eat multiple, but in first sequence I have two by turn 8, in second only one by turn 9.\n\nMoreover, in first sequence, after eating (2,1), I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) after eat, I can move R to (3,1) or L to (1,1), then to (3,1) to (4,1) but (4,1) wall, so to (4,2) but (4,2) wall, so need to go up or something.\n\n(3,1) to (4,1) wall, so cannot; to (3,2), then to (4,2) wall, etc.\n\nBut there is (6,2) food.\n\nI can go via (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3), etc. to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) life span until turn 9, so on turn 8, after eating (2,1), I can start moving right, but (6,2) might disappear soon.\n\nTurn 8, (6,2) life span at turn 4 is 6, so on turn 8, life span left: from turn 4 L=6, turn 5 L=5, ..., turn 8 L=3, so available until turn 9 (since disappears after N turns, turn 4+6=10? Earlier calculation.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, available until turn t + L - 1.\n\nTurn 4 L=6, available turns 4 to 9 (turns 4,5,6,7,8,9)\n\nSimilarly, turn 9 is last chance for (6,2).\n\nOn turn 8, from (2,1), after eating, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)], head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nThen turn 9: I can move R to (3,1), for example.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), but (3,2) free? Not wall.\n\nThen to (4,2) but (4,2) wall, cannot; to (3,3), etc., but (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, so I need to go right.\n\nFrom (3,1), move R to (4,1) but (4,1) wall, cannot; so only U or possibly L, but L to (2,1) body, invalid; or D to (3,0) wall.\n\nSo from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), or R to (4,1) wall invalid, L to (2,1) body invalid, D to (3,0) wall invalid, so only U to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 10: at (3,2), can move U, D, L, R.\n\nBut (6,2) may be gone if not eaten by turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is last for (6,2), but on turn 9, I'm at (3,1), not at (6,2).\n\nI cannot reach (6,2) by turn 9 from here.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) was eaten on turn 8, so gone.\n\n(5,1) is available until turn 10.\n\nBut from (3,2), I can go to (4,2) but wall, so to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut it might be messy.\n\nIn the first sequence, by going for (2,4) and (2,1), I might miss (5,1) or (6,2), but (6,2) is hard to reach from left.\n\nIn the second sequence, by going right, I eat (5,1) on turn 9, and (6,2) is at (6,2), which I can reach from (5,1) or (5,2).\n\nAfter eating (5,1) on turn 9, at (5,1), I can move to (5,2) or (6,1), but (6,1) may be wall or free.\n\n(6,1): x=6,y=1, not border, internal not listed, so free.\n\nThen to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut (6,2) must be eaten by turn 9, on turn 9 I'm at (5,1), not at (6,2), so I cannot eat (6,2) on turn 9; on turn 10 it disappears.\n\nLife span: available until turn 9, so on turn 10 it's gone.\n\nSo if I don't eat on turn 9, I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, in first sequence, I cannot reach it.\n\nBut (6,2) is only one food, and I might not get it, but I can get others.\n\n(5,1) available until turn 10, so in right sequence, I eat it on turn 9.\n\nThen I can go for other food, but only (2,4) and (2,1) left, but (2,4) life until turn 13, (2,1) until turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is last for (2,1), but on turn 9 I'm at (5,1), far from (2,1), so I miss (2,1).\n\nIn left sequence, I eat (2,4) and (2,1), missing (5,1) and (6,2) probably.\n\n(6,2) I miss in both, but (5,1) I can get in right sequence.\n\nIn left sequence, after eating (2,1) on turn 8, I can try to go to (5,1), but (5,1) available until turn 10, so from (2,1) turn 8, I can move to (3,1) turn 9, then to (3,2) turn 10, but (5,1) must be eaten by turn 10, on turn 10 I can be at (4,1) but (4,1) wall, or (5,1) directly? From (3,2) to (4,2) wall, so to (3,3), etc., not to (5,1) by turn 10.\n\nSo I can only eat (5,1) if I go right early.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), I can only eat if I go right and eat by turn 9.\n\nBut from (4,5) or (5,5), I can go to (6,2) faster.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, from (4,5), instead of going to (5,5), I can go D to (4,4), then to (5,4), etc.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4)  -- (5,4) free\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,2) to eat (6,2)\n\nOn turn 9, eat (6,2).\n\nThen I can go to (5,1) on turn 10, since (5,1) available turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: from (6,2), move L to (5,2), or D to (6,1), etc., but to (5,1), from (6,2) move L to (5,2), then D to (5,1) turn 11, but turn 11 (5,1) disappeared, life span 7 at turn 4, available turns 4 to 10, turn 11 gone.\n\nSo on turn 10, I need to be at (5,1) to eat.\n\nFrom (6,2) on turn 9 after eat, positions say [ (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] or something, but to go to (5,1), I can move from (6,2) to (6,1) or (5,2), but (5,2) to (5,1) on turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: from (5,2) move D to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 9, after eating (6,2), I'm at (6,2), so on turn 10, I can move to (5,2) or (6,1), then to (5,1) if possible.\n\nFrom (6,2), turn 10 move L to (5,2), then turn 11 move D to (5,1), but turn 11 too late.\n\nIf from (6,2) I move directly to (5,1)? Not adjacent, diagonal not allowed.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,1) after eating (6,2) on turn 9.\n\nIf I eat (5,1) first.\n\nTurn 4: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,1) eat\n\nThen on turn 10, I can go to (6,2) but (6,2) gone on turn 10.\n\n(6,2) available until turn 9, so on turn 9 I must eat it, but on turn 9 I'm eating (5,1), so cannot.\n\nSo I can only eat one of (5,1) or (6,2), not both, because of timing and position.\n\n(5,1) and (6,2) are close, but to eat both, I need to eat one then the other quickly.\n\nFor example, on turn 9 eat (5,1), but (6,2) must be eaten on turn 9, same turn, impossible.\n\nOr eat (6,2) on turn 8 or earlier.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,2), I can move R to (6,2) to eat on turn 8.\n\nThen on turn 9, I can move to (5,2) or something, then to (5,1) on turn 10.\n\nBut (5,1) available turn 10.\n\nTurn 8: eat (6,2) at (6,2)\n\nPositions: after eat, head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3) etc., but let's see length.\n\nBefore turn 8, at turn 7, positions from earlier: after turn 7, say from turn 6: after turn 6 move R to (5,4), positions [(5,4), (4,4)] or something.\n\nStart over.\n\nTurn 4: R to (4,5), pos [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 5: D to (4,4), pos [(4,4), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 6: R to (5,4), pos [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 7: D to (5,3), pos [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 8: R to (6,2)? (6,2) from (5,3)? Not adjacent. From (5,3) to (6,2) diagonal, no.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move R to (6,3), D to (5,2), or L to (4,3), U to (5,4) body.\n\nSo to reach (6,2), I need to go to (6,3) or (5,2) first.\n\nSay turn 8: move D to (5,2) from (5,3)\n\nPos [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nThen turn 9: move R to (6,2) to eat (6,2)\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,2), move L to (5,2), but (5,2) may be body or free.\n\nAfter eating on turn 9, positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), and since eaten, tail not moved, so previous tail (5,3) still, so pos [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3)]\n\nThen turn 10, from (6,2), move to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, cannot; move D to (6,1), or U to (6,3), or R to (7,2) wall.\n\n(6,1) free, (6,3) free.\n\nBut to eat (5,1), I need to be there on turn 10.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move to (6,1), then to (5,1) on turn 11, but turn 11 (5,1) gone.\n\nMove directly to (5,1) not possible.\n\nSo I can only eat (6,2) on turn 9, but not (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,1) on turn 9, miss (6,2).\n\nSo in the right area, I can eat one of the bottom foods.\n\nBut in the left area, I can eat (2,4) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) available until turn 9, and I eat on turn 8, so ok.\n\n(2,4) until turn 13, no issue.\n\nAnd I have two foods.\n\nWhereas on right, I can get only one.\n\nAlso, there is (5,1) but I might not get it from left, but in left sequence I get two, in right I get one, so better to go left.\n\nMoreover, after eating (2,1), I can explore other areas.\n\nFor example, there might be more food later, but currently only these.\n\nSo I think for turn 4, moving D to (3,4) is better.\n\nThen the sequence as I had: turn 4 D, turn 5 L to eat (2,4), turn 6 D to (2,3), turn 7 D to (2,2), turn 8 D to (2,1) eat.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for turns 4 to 8.\n\nBut the format is to box the answer.\n\nAlso, for turn 5, when I move L to (2,4), I eat food, so it's good.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions:\n\nTurn 4: D (down)\n\nTurn 5: L (left)\n\nTurn 6: D (down)\n\nTurn 7: D (down)\n\nTurn 8: D (down) to (2,1)\n\nIn terms of direction, after each move, the head direction changes.\n\nBut for the action, I just need to specify the move.\n\nAlso, in turn 5, moving L is allowed because current direction after turn 4 is D, and L is not opposite to D.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are valid.\n\nI think this is a reasonable plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5 turns ahead (turns 4 to 8). The key considerations are:\n- The snake starts at [(3,5), (2,5)] with head direction right (R), so for turn 4, moving left (L) is invalid due to the no instant reverse rule.\n- Moving up (U) to (3,6) leads to a dead end, as only down (D) is possible from there, risking entrapment.\n- Moving down (D) to (3,4) allows access to the positive food at (2,4) on turn 5, which is the closest food with a long life span (available until turn 13), minimizing immediate risk.\n- After eating (2,4), the snake grows to length 3, and moving down repeatedly allows eating (2,1) on turn 8 (available until turn 9), scoring two points while avoiding walls and body collisions.\n- This path keeps the snake in open areas, reducing collision risks with walls or body segments. Alternative paths (e.g., moving right initially) delay eating and may miss food due to life spans.\n- The sequence below ensures survival for at least 5 turns, with opportunities to eat more food beyond turn 8.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 4 to 8):**\n- Turn 4: Move down (D) to (3,4). This avoids the dead end from moving up and positions the snake to reach (2,4). Valid moves from (3,5) are U, D, R; D is chosen for food access.\n- Turn 5: Move left (L) to (2,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length +1). New head direction is L. From (3,4), L is valid (not opposite to prior direction D) and (2,4) is free.\n- Turn 6: Move down (D) to (2,3). From (2,4), D is valid (U and D are possible; R is invalid as (3,4) is body; L is wall). This heads toward (2,1).\n- Turn 7: Move down (D) to (2,2). From (2,3), D is valid (U to (2,4) is body; L to (1,3) and R to (3,3) are possible but D is consistent with the path).\n- Turn 8: Move down (D) to (2,1) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length +1). From (2,2), D is valid (U to (2,3) is body; L to (1,2) is wall; R to (3,2) is possible but D eats food).\n\n**Beyond Turn 8:**\n- After turn 8, the snake is at [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] with head direction D. Possible moves include left (L) to (1,1) or right (R) to (3,1) to avoid the vertical line and seek other food (e.g., (5,1) or future spawns). (5,1) is available until turn 10, so reaching it may be feasible with careful pathing.\n\nThis sequence scores 2 points by turn 8, avoids all walls and collisions, and maintains flexibility for future turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D (down)\nTurn 5: L (left)\nTurn 6: D (down)\nTurn 7: D (down)\nTurn 8: D (down)\n}",
