        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn t1 = 0:\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\n- Snake: Positions are [(3,3)]. Since it's just one segment, that means the snake is only the head right now. Head direction is Left, so it's moving left.\n\n- Food:\n  - (3,4) with value 1, life span 10\n  - (5,2) with value 1, life span 10\n  - (2,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has positive value and the same life span, so no negative food here. Life span is 10, meaning each food will disappear after 10 turns if not eaten, but since we're at turn 0, they have 10 turns left.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, eating food will make it grow to two segments. Also, because it's just the head, there's no body to collide with except walls and obstacles.\n\nMovement constraints: I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is Left, I cannot move Right on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns. The answer should include actions from turn t1=0 onwards, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 moves, but the format might expect actions for a few turns. The boxed answer should have actions starting from turn 0.\n\nLet me sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake head at (3,3), moving left.\n\nFood at:\n- (3,4): directly above the head\n- (5,2): to the right and down\n- (2,5): to the left and up\n\nSince the head is at (3,3) and moving left, if I continue left, I go to (2,3). But (2,3) has no food, so I wouldn't eat anything immediately.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Up: to (3,4) – there is food there, so I could eat it.\n- Down: to (3,2)\n- Left: to (2,3)\n- Right: to (4,3) – but current direction is Left, so moving Right would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So I cannot move Right on this turn.\n\nTherefore, possible actions at turn 0: Up, Down, or Left.\n\nIf I move Up to (3,4), I eat the food there. Since it's positive food, I gain +1 score, and snake length increases to 2. The head moves to (3,4), and the body is at (3,3). Now, the snake has two segments.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to choose a direction from (3,4), with the tail at (3,3). Since the tail will move when I move, but only if I don't eat food, the tail stays if I eat.\n\nGeneral rule: When I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move. When I don't eat, the tail moves forward.\n\nIn this case, if I eat at (3,4), the head is at (3,4), and body at (3,3). Then when I move next, if I don't eat, the tail moves away.\n\nBut right now, at turn 0, if I move Up, I eat the food at (3,4).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all food positions:\n\n- (3,4): value 1, life 10\n- (5,2): value 1, life 10\n- (2,5): value 1, life 10\n\nSince life span is 10, and we're at turn 0, they'll disappear at turn 10 if not eaten.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nAlso, since the snake is short, collisions aren't a big issue yet, but I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4) – has food, so eat it, grow to length 2.\n- Down: (3,2) – no food.\n- Left: (2,3) – no food.\n\nIf I go Up and eat, then I have a body segment, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), snake positions: head at (3,4), tail at (3,3). Head direction was Left, but after moving Up, the new direction is Up, so for the next move, I can move in any direction except Down (since instant reverse not allowed).\n\nThen from (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,5) – but y=5 is within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=5 is ok. No food at (3,5) currently.\n- Down: (3,3) – but (3,3) is where the tail is. If I move Down to (3,3), since the tail is there, but when I move, the tail will move only if I don't eat food. If I move to (3,3) and there's no food there (since I just ate, and no new food spawned), so I don't eat, so the tail moves away. But at the moment of move, the head moves to (3,3) which is occupied by the tail, but since the tail is moving away simultaneously, it's ok as long as I don't eat and the tail moves.\n\nThe rules say: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward. So it's not a collision.\n\nBut in this case, if I move Down to (3,3), the head goes to where the tail was, and the tail moves to... but since there's only one body segment, after moving, if I don't eat, the snake moves, so head to (3,3), and tail disappears? No.\n\nSnake positions: after eating at turn 0, positions are [(3,4), (3,3)] with head at (3,4).\n\nAt turn 1, if I move Down to (3,3), but (3,3) is the tail. Since I'm moving to the tail cell, and I don't eat food (assuming no food there), then the head moves to (3,3), and the tail moves... but in snake movement, when you move without eating, the tail segment is removed. So the new positions would be head at (3,3), and no body, since it was only one segment.\n\nLet's clarify snake movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves:\n- If it eats food, head moves to new cell, body stays, and a new segment is added, so length increases.\n- If it doesn't eat, head moves to new cell, and the tail segment is removed, so length stays the same.\n\nIn this case, after turn 0, if I ate, snake has two segments: head (3,4) and tail (3,3).\n\nAt turn 1, if I move Down to (3,3):\n- The cell (3,3) is currently occupied by the tail.\n- I move head to (3,3). Since (3,3) is the tail, and I'm moving there, but there's no food there (food was at (3,4), which I ate), so I don't eat.\n- Therefore, the head moves to (3,3), and the tail is removed. So now snake is just at [(3,3)] again, length 1.\n\nSo effectively, I returned to the start position with no growth, but I did eat food at turn 0, so I have +1 score and length was 2 temporarily, but after moving down, it's back to 1? That can't be right.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nWhen you move to a cell without food, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens only if it was longer, but in this case, from length 2, moving without eating: head moves to new position, tail is removed, so it becomes length 1 again.\n\nBut that means eating food and then moving back cancels the growth? That seems odd, but logically correct for snake game.\n\nTypically in snake, once you grow, you stay grown unless you die, but the length is permanent; you don't lose segments unless you crash.\n\nIn standard snake, the length increases when you eat, and when you move without eating, the tail moves, but the length doesn't decrease; only the position shifts.\n\nI think I have a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me think: Snake starts with one segment at S.\n\nEat food: head moves to food, new head position, and tail stays, so now two segments.\n\nThen move without eating: head moves to new cell, tail moves to the next position, so the body follows. The tail segment is removed from its old position, but the snake still has two segments; it's just that the tail position changes.\n\nIn terms of positions, for a snake of length L, when moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake occupies L cells, but the positions shift.\n\nAfter eating, the snake has more segments.\n\nIn this case: at turn 0, head at (3,3), move Up to (3,4) and eat, so now snake positions: [(3,4), (3,3)] — head at (3,4), body at (3,3).\n\nLength is 2.\n\nAt turn 1, if I move Down to (3,3):\n- Head moves to (3,3).\n- Since I don't eat food at (3,3), the tail is removed. But the tail is at (3,3), which is where the head is moving? Conflict.\n\nTypically, in snake movement:\n- The head moves first to the new cell.\n- If the new cell has food, it is eaten, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the head position, but since head moved, the body stays, so the snake grows.\n- If no food, the head moves to new cell, and the tail is removed from its position, so the snake moves forward.\n\nBut when the head moves to the tail's position, it's ok because the tail will move away.\n\nFor example, positions: head at H, body at T.\n\nMove to new cell N.\nIf N is not food, head goes to N, tail is removed, so the new head is at N, and since there was only one body, now the snake is just at [N], so length 1.\n\nIf there were more segments, it would be different.\n\nIn this specific case with two segments:\n- Start: head at A, tail at B.\n- Move to C: if C has food, head to C, tail stays at B, so positions [C, A] or [C, B]? Order: head first, so if head moves to C, and tail is still at B, so positions [C, B], with C head, B body.\n\nThen if no eat, move to D: head to D, tail is removed, so positions [D, C], with D head, C body.\n\nBut if moving to the tail position, like from [C,B] move to B: head moves to B, which was tail. Since no food, tail is removed. But tail was at B, so removing tail, and head is now at B, so snake is just [B], length 1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So by moving back to the previous position, you lose the body segment and are back to length 1.\n\nIn this game, that would mean the score doesn't decrease, but length decreases, which might not be desirable.\n\nBut in terms of score, you keep the point, but the snake is shorter, so it's easier to maneuver but you have to grow again.\n\nBut for scoring, the score is based on food eaten, not length, I think. The prompt says \"score\" from eating food, and length increases when eating positive food.\n\nSo score is separate from length, but length affects mobility.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nAt turn 0, from (3,3), I can move U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), I eat the food, score +1, snake becomes [(3,4), (3,3)], length 2.\n\nThen at turn 1, from (3,4), I can move U, D, L, R, but not down if I just moved up? Direction: after moving up, new head direction is U, so I cannot move D (instant reverse).\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nIf I move D to (3,3), as above, no food, so head moves to (3,3), tail is removed, so snake is now [(3,3)] alone, length 1, and I'm back to start, but with +1 score.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), no food, so head to (3,5), tail moves to (3,4)? Positions: before move, head (3,4), tail (3,3).\n\nMove head to (3,5), no eat, so tail is removed, but since only one body, new positions: head at (3,5), body at (3,4)? When no eat, the head moves to new cell, and the tail segment is removed, so the new snake is the head at new position and the body without the tail.\n\nWith two segments: [head, tail]\n\nAfter moving to new cell without eating: new head at new cell, and the tail is gone, so only the new head position. But that can't be right for length.\n\nI think I have a fundamental mistake.\n\nLet's read the rules.\n\nThe rules don't specify the movement in detail, but from the food mechanics, it says \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, implying that otherwise, length is constant.\n\nAlso, in the tail reward danger, it talks about the tail moving away.\n\nFrom the core rules:\n\n\"**Special Cases**:  \n- Food can spawn under the snake's body but can *only be eaten* if:  \n  1. The body moves away, *and*  \n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.  \n- **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nThis implies that the tail moves when the snake moves without eating.\n\nStandard snake movement:\n\n- Each turn, the head moves to an adjacent cell.\n- If that cell has food, it is eaten, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the head's new position.\n- If no food, the head moves, and the tail moves forward to the next position, so the snake shifts, and the last tail cell is vacated.\n\nIn terms of positions, for a snake with segments [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to a new cell N:\n- If N has food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  (length increases)\n- If no food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ...]  (the T position is removed, so length same, positions shifted)\n\nWhen moving to N, if N is the current tail position, and no food, then it's ok because the tail will move away, but in the new positions, T is not there anymore.\n\nIn the case of two segments: [H, T]\n\nMove to N:\n- If N has food, new positions [N, H, T]? No, typically, when eating, the tail stays, so new head N, and the body is H, so [N, H] with N head, H body. T is not there; it's only two segments.\n\nPositions: before move, head at H, body at T.\n\nAfter moving to N and eating: head at N, body at H (which was the previous head), so positions [N, H].\n\nAfter moving to N without eating: head at N, and since no eat, the tail is removed, so only [N], but that means the body is gone, length 1.\n\nBut that can't be, because the body should follow.\n\nI think I'm confusing the naming.\n\nLet's define: the snake has a list of positions, ordered from head to tail.\n\nFor example, initial: positions [(3,3)] , head at (3,3), no body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) and eating: new positions [(3,4), (3,3)] , head at (3,4), body at (3,3).\n\nNow, from here, move to a new cell, say (3,5), with no food.\n\nThen: head moves to (3,5), and since no food, the tail is removed. The tail is at (3,3), so it is removed, and the new positions are [(3,5)] only? But that would mean the body at (3,3) is gone, and only head at (3,5), so length 1.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the body should move to where the head was.\n\nI think I have it wrong.\n\nCorrect snake movement:\n\n- When the head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail end is removed, but the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on.\n\nFor positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving head to N:\n- If no food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ...]  (the last position T is removed)\n- If food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  (T stays, so length increases)\n\nIn the case of two segments: [H, T]\n\nMove to N:\n- No food: new positions [N, H]  (T is removed, so body is now at H)\n- With food: new positions [N, H, T]? No, with food, the tail doesn't move, so positions become [N, H] but since eating, a new segment is added, so it becomes [N, H, T] only if T was there, but T is the tail, so when eating, the tail stays, so positions [N, H] and the tail is still T, but H is now body, so [N, H] with N head, H body, and T is gone because it was the tail but not moved.\n\nI'm messing up.\n\nStandard: when you eat, the snake grows by adding a new segment at the head position after move, so the body doesn't move.\n\nExample:\nStart: snake at [A] (length 1)\nMove to B and eat: snake becomes [B, A] (length 2)\n\nMove to C, no eat: snake becomes [C, B] (length 2, body at B)\n\nMove to D, eat: snake becomes [D, C, B] (length 3)\n\n Etc.\n\nIn the move to C no eat, from [B,A], head at B, body at A.\nMove head to C, no eat, so new head at C, and the body: since no eat, the tail is removed, so the new body is the old head position B, so positions [C, B].\n\nTail was at A, removed.\n\nSimilarly, from [C,B], move to D and eat, new head at D, and since eat, the body stays, so new positions [D, C, B], with D head, C body, B tail.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nAt turn 0: snake at [(3,3)] (head only)\n\nMove Up to (3,4), eat food there, so new snake: [(3,4), (3,3)] head at (3,4), body at (3,3)\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), I can move.\n\nSay I move Down to (3,3): head moves to (3,3), which is the current body position.\n\nIs there food at (3,3)? No, food was at (3,4) eaten, so no food at (3,3).\n\nSo no eat, therefore, new positions: head at (3,3), and the body: since no eat, the tail is removed. Tail was at (3,3), but head is moving to (3,3), so it's the same cell.\n\nWhen head moves to (3,3), which is occupied by the body, but since no eat, the tail should be removed, but the tail is at (3,3), and head is moving there, so it might be a collision or not.\n\nThe rules say: \"I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward.\"\n\nBut in this case, for two segments, when head moves to the tail position, and no eat, then the tail is removed, so the new snake is just at the new head position, length 1.\n\nSpecifically: positions before move: head at (3,4), body at (3,3)\n\nMove head to (3,3): new head position (3,3)\n\nSince no food, the tail is removed. Tail is at (3,3), so it is removed, but new head is at (3,3), so snake is now [(3,3)] alone.\n\nSo effectively, I have no body, back to start, but I have the score from eating.\n\nIf I had moved to a different cell, it would be different.\n\nBut in this case, moving down to (3,3) results in snake at (3,3) with no body.\n\nFor planning, I need to avoid such moves if I want to keep the length.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the initial move.\n\nAt turn 0, from (3,3), possible actions:\n\n- Up: to (3,4) - eat food, gain +1, snake grows to [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\n- Down: to (3,2) - no food, so snake moves to [(3,2)] (since no body, it's just head moving, so new position [(3,2)])\n\n- Left: to (2,3) - no food, snake to [(2,3)]\n\n- Right: not allowed, instant reverse.\n\nSo moving Up gives immediate reward but then I have to deal with the body.\n\nMoving Down or Left moves to a new position with no growth.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nLet's list all cells for reference.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7) but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7) for all x are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1).\n\nFood at: (3,4), (5,2), (2,5)\n\nAll with value 1, life 10.\n\nSince life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 0, life 10, after turn 0, if not eaten, life 9 at turn 1, and so on.\n\nBut since we're planning, we can assume they disappear after 10 turns.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all food, but with survival.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving Up at turn 0 to eat (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 1, snake at [(3,4), (3,3)] head at (3,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but D is instant reverse? Direction is U, so cannot move D, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,4), with direction U, can move U, L, R, not D.\n\n- U to (3,5)\n- L to (2,4)\n- R to (4,4)\n\nNo Down allowed.\n\n(3,3) is down, but I can't move there because it's opposite direction.\n\nSo options: U, L, R.\n\nNow, (3,5) has no food, (2,4) no, (4,4) no.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), no food, so new positions: head to (3,5), body to (3,4), so [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if L to (2,4), [(2,4), (3,4)]? Before move, positions [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nMove head to (2,4), no food, so new head (2,4), and body: since no eat, tail removed, tail was (3,3), removed, and the old head (3,4) becomes body, so new positions [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nHead at (2,4), body at (3,4).\n\nDirection now L.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nNow, to plan ahead, I should aim for other food.\n\nOther food at (5,2) and (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is left and up from current, (5,2) is right and down.\n\nSince I'm at (3,4) after eating, or if I don't eat.\n\nBut let's think from turn 0.\n\nOption 1: Move Up at turn 0 to eat (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 1, from (3,4), direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nIf I want to go to (2,5), which is at (2,5), so from (3,4), moving L to (2,4) then U to (2,5), but (2,5) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) from (3,4) moving R to (4,4) then D to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nTurn 0: Move U to (3,4), eat food, snake now [(3,4), (3,3)], score +1, direction U.\n\nTurn 1: I need to move. Say I move L to (2,4), no food, so new positions: head to (2,4), body to (3,4), so [(2,4), (3,4)], direction L.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4), direction L, can move L, U, D (not R, instant reverse).\n\n- L to (1,4)\n- U to (2,5)\n- D to (2,3)\n\n(2,5) has food, so I can move U to (2,5) and eat it.\n\nSo turn 2: Move U to (2,5), eat food, so new positions: head to (2,5), body stays, so [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]? Before move, positions [(2,4), (3,4)] with head at (2,4), body at (3,4).\n\nMove head to (2,5), eat food, so new head at (2,5), and body: since eat, the tail does not move, so the body is still at (2,4) and (3,4), so new positions [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] with head (2,5), body (2,4) and (3,4).\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection now U.\n\nThen I have food at (5,2) to eat.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move to reach (5,2).\n\nFor example, move R to (3,5), then down, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nObstacle at (3,1), which is below.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nNow, if at turn 0 I don't move up, but move left or down.\n\nSuppose at turn 0, I move Left to (2,3), no food, so snake to [(2,3)], direction L.\n\nThen at turn 1, from (2,3), direction L, can move L, U, D (not R).\n\n- L to (1,3)\n- U to (2,4)\n- D to (2,2)\n\n(2,5) is above, so I can move U to (2,4), then U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 1: Move U to (2,4), no food, so new position [(2,4)], direction U.\n\nTurn 2: Move U to (2,5), eat food, snake to [(2,5), (2,4)], score +1.\n\nThen I have (3,4) and (5,2) to eat.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is right and down from (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), direction U, can move U, L, R (not D).\n\n- U to (2,6)\n- L to (1,5)\n- R to (3,5)\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), so I need to go down, but I can't move down directly because direction U, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo I have to move sideways first.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,5), no food, so positions to [(3,5), (2,5)], direction R.\n\nThen from (3,5), direction R, can move R, U, D (not L).\n\n- R to (4,5)\n- U to (3,6)\n- D to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) has food, so I can move D to (3,4) and eat, but (3,4) is below, and direction is R, so moving D is not instant reverse? Instant reverse is only opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). U and D are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSo I can move D to (3,4), which has food, so eat it.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,5) move D to (3,4), eat, so new positions: head to (3,4), body stays, so [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? Before: [(3,5), (2,5)] head (3,5), body (2,5)\n\nMove to (3,4) eat, new head (3,4), body: tail stays, so positions [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen I have (5,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten (3,4) first, I could go to (2,5).\n\nNow, the third food at (5,2).\n\nAlso, life span is 10, so I have time.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nSince the snake is short, few risks.\n\nAnother option at turn 0: move Down to (3,2).\n\nThen snake to [(3,2)], direction D.\n\nThen I can go to (5,2) which is at (5,2), so right and same y? (3,2) to (5,2) is east.\n\nFrom (3,2), direction D, can move D, L, R (not U).\n\n- D to (3,1) but (3,1) is obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSo from (3,2), cannot move D to (3,1).\n\nCan move L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2, so from (3,2) move R to (4,2), then R to (5,2) to eat.\n\nTurn 0: Move D to (3,2), no eat, snake [(3,2)], direction D.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,2), direction D, can move L, R, D but D to (3,1) blocked, so only L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\nSay move R to (4,2), no food, snake to [(4,2)], direction R.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,2), eat food, snake to [(5,2), (4,2)], score +1.\n\nThen I have (3,4) and (2,5) to eat.\n\nFrom (5,2), direction R, can move R, U, D (not L).\n\n- R to (6,2)\n- U to (5,3)\n- D to (5,1)\n\nBut y=1, y=0 is wall, so (5,1) is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so (5,1) is playable, but no food.\n\n(3,4) is left and up.\n\nTo go to (3,4), I need to move left and up, but direction is R, so I can move U or D or R.\n\nMove U to (5,3), then left, etc.\n\nBut I have to avoid the obstacle at (3,1).\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n- If I eat (3,4) first, I can then go to (2,5) or (5,2)\n\n- If I eat (2,5) first, I can go to (3,4) or (5,2)\n\n- If I eat (5,2) first, I can go to others.\n\nBut eating (3,4) is immediate from start.\n\nAlso, (3,4) is adjacent, so eating it quickly might be good.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival and efficiency.\n\nSince all food has same value and life, order might not matter, but with the body, it might be harder to maneuver later.\n\nFor example, if I eat (3,4) at turn 0, I have a body, so when I go to (2,5), I have to be careful not to hit myself, but with short length, it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (5,2) is near the obstacle, but not directly.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but since snake is short, not an issue yet.\n\nAlso, food can be under body, but not now.\n\nSo for now, eating (3,4) at turn 0 seems good.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5).\n\nAs in the first plan: turn 0: U to (3,4) eat\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4) direction U, I can move L to (2,4) to head towards (2,5)\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4) move U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen I have (5,2) to eat.\n\nFrom (2,5), direction U, can move R to (3,5), then down to (3,4) but (3,4) might have body or not.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), snake at [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] for example.\n\nHead at (2,5), body at (2,4) and (3,4).\n\nNow to go to (5,2), I need to move right and down.\n\nFrom (2,5), move R to (3,5), no food, so new positions: head to (3,5), body: since no eat, tail removed, tail was (3,4), removed, so new positions [(3,5), (2,5)] with head (3,5), body (2,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (3,5), move D to (3,4), but (3,4) may have food or not? Food at (3,4) was eaten at turn 0, and not respawned, so no food there.\n\nSo move D to (3,4), no food, new positions: head to (3,4), body to (3,5)? Before move: [(3,5), (2,5)] head (3,5), body (2,5)\n\nMove to (3,4), no eat, new head (3,4), and tail removed, tail was (2,5), removed, so new positions [(3,4), (3,5)]? The body: old head (3,5) becomes body, so [(3,4), (3,5)] with head (3,4), body (3,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (3,4), I need to go to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction D, can move D, L, R (not U).\n\n- D to (3,3)\n- L to (2,4)\n- R to (4,4)\n\n(3,3) might be free, etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is two right and two down.\n\nI can move R to (4,4), then R to (5,4), then D to (5,3), then D to (5,2), but need to check if food is still there.\n\nLife span 10, from turn 0, after several turns.\n\nTurn 0: eat (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: eat (2,5)\n\nTurn 3: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: move to (3,4) — but (3,4) is empty now\n\nAt turn 4, positions after move: head at (3,4), body at (3,5)\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,4) move R to (4,4), no food\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (5,4), no food\n\nThen turn 7: move D to (5,3), no food\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,2), eat food if still there.\n\nLife span: food at (5,2) has life 10 at turn 0.\n\nAt turn 0, life 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, life 9 at turn 1.\n\nGenerally, life decreases each turn, including the turn it is present.\n\nAt turn t, food has life L, it disappears after L turns, so at turn t+L, it's gone.\n\nFor (5,2), at turn 0, life 10, so it exists from turn 0 to turn 9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt turn 8, when I move to (5,2), if I arrive on turn 8, food is still there since life span decreases to 2 at turn 8? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 0: food life 10\n\nTurn 1: life 9\n\n...\n\nTurn 8: life 2, so still there.\n\nTurn 9: life 1\n\nTurn 10: life 0, disappears, so not eatable on turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 8, I can eat it if I arrive then.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 8 move to (5,2), eat.\n\nBut is (5,2) free? No obstacles.\n\nIn this path, I ate all three foods.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,4) first, I might eat others faster.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, move Left to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1 move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2 move U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen from (2,5) to (3,4): as before, turn 3 move R to (3,5), turn 4 move D to (3,4) but (3,4) food was not eaten? In this case, I didn't eat (3,4) yet.\n\nIn this sequence: turn 0 move L to (2,3), no eat\n\nTurn 1 move U to (2,4), no eat\n\nTurn 2 move U to (2,5), eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4)] or after eat, [(2,5), (2,4)]? Positions: before move to (2,5), head at (2,4), move to (2,5) eat, so new head (2,5), body at (2,4), so [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,5) direction U, move R to (3,5), no eat, new positions [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5) direction R, move D to (3,4), and (3,4) has food, so eat, new positions [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen to (5,2): from (3,4) move R to (4,4), turn 5\n\nMove R to (5,4), turn 6\n\nMove D to (5,3), turn 7\n\nMove D to (5,2), turn 8 eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go to (5,2) first.\n\nTurn 0: move Down to (3,2), no eat\n\nBut (3,2) to (3,1) blocked, so move R to (4,2) on turn 1? Turn 0 move D to (3,2), snake [(3,2)]\n\nTurn 1: from (3,2) direction D, move R to (4,2), no eat, snake [(4,2)]\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,2), eat, snake [(5,2), (4,2)]\n\nThen to (2,5): from (5,2) direction R, move U to (5,3), turn 3\n\nMove U to (5,4), turn 4\n\nMove L to (4,4), turn 5\n\nMove L to (3,4), but (3,4) has food, so eat on turn 6 if I go directly.\n\nFrom (5,4) move L to (4,4), then to (3,4).\n\nTurn 3: from (5,2) move U to (5,3), no eat, positions: from [(5,2), (4,2)] move head to (5,3), no eat, so new positions [(5,3), (5,2)]? Head to (5,3), body: old head (5,2) becomes body, tail (4,2) removed? Before: [(5,2), (4,2)] head (5,2), body (4,2)\n\nMove to (5,3) no eat: new head (5,3), tail removed, so body is old head (5,2), so [(5,3), (5,2)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,4), no eat, new positions [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,4), no eat, new positions [(4,4), (5,4)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4), and eat food, new positions [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]? Before move: [(4,4), (5,4)] head (4,4), body (5,4)\n\nMove to (3,4) eat, new head (3,4), body stays, so positions [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]\n\nThen to (2,5): from (3,4) direction L (since moved left), can move L, U, D (not R).\n\n(2,5) is up-left.\n\nMove U to (3,5), turn 7\n\nThen L to (2,5), turn 8 eat.\n\nBut (2,5) life: at turn 8, life original 10, decreased by 8 turns, so life 2, still there.\n\nSimilarly, all can be eaten.\n\nIn all cases, I can eat all three by around turn 8.\n\nBut if I eat (3,4) first, I get the score immediately and start growing.\n\nAlso, with a longer snake, I need to avoid self-collision, but in this grid, it should be manageable.\n\nNow, about the obstacle at (3,1), it might affect movements near y=1.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (3,2), I have to avoid (3,1), but since I don't need to go there, it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format says: \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nSince t1=0, I can provide turns 0 to 4 or more.\n\nBut I need to specify a sequence.\n\nAlso, prioritize survival, but here no immediate danger.\n\nSince moving Up at turn 0 gives immediate reward, and I can plan to eat others.\n\nI could move Left or Down to eat (2,5) or (5,2) first, but (3,4) is closer.\n\n(3,4) is adjacent up, while (2,5) is two moves away, (5,2) is also two moves away.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,5): need to go left and up, but not diagonal, so min two moves, e.g., left then up, or up then left.\n\nSimilarly for (5,2): right then down, or down then right, but down to (3,2) then right to (4,2) etc.\n\nSo (3,4) is one move away.\n\nSo eating (3,4) first is efficient.\n\nThen I can go to (2,5).\n\nIn the sequence to (2,5), after eating (3,4), I move left to (2,4), then up to (2,5).\n\nAfter that, to (5,2), I need to go across.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right to (3,5), then down to (3,4), but (3,4) is empty, then to (4,4), (5,4), down to (5,3), (5,2).\n\nBut I can go directly down from (2,5), but direction after eating (2,5) is U, so I can move D? Instant reverse not allowed, so I cannot move down directly; I have to move sideways first.\n\nAs before.\n\nTo save moves, from (2,5) after eating, I can move R to (3,5), then since direction R, I can move D to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is not food anymore.\n\nI could go to (5,2) via a different path, but it might take similar time.\n\nAnother food is at (5,2), which is near the bottom.\n\nBut with life 10, plenty of time.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, I'll go with eating (3,4) first.\n\nSo turn 0: move U to (3,4) eat\n\nThen turn 1: move L to (2,4) no eat\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat\n\nNow, from here, direction U, so for turn 3, I need to move, cannot move D, so move R to (3,5) no eat\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5) direction R, move D to (3,4) no eat (since food gone)\n\nBut (3,4) might be occupied? At this point, after turn 2, snake is [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]? Let's track positions.\n\nTurn 0 start: snake [(3,3)] dir L\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4) eat, new snake [(3,4), (3,3)] dir U\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4) no eat: head to (2,4), no eat, so tail removed, tail was (3,3), so new positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), so [(2,4), (3,4)] dir L\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat: head to (2,5), eat, so new head (2,5), body stays, so positions [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] dir U\n\nTurn 3: from (2,5) dir U, move R to (3,5) no eat: head to (3,5), no eat, so tail removed, tail was (3,4), so new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5) and (2,4)? Body: the segments are (2,5) and (2,4) and (3,4), tail is (3,4).\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5), no eat, tail (3,4) removed, so new positions: the old head (2,5) becomes body, and (2,4) is still there, so [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]? Order: head to new position, then previous positions except tail removed.\n\nPositions before move: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nMove head to (3,5), no eat, so new head (3,5), and the tail (3,4) is removed, so the body is now [ (2,5), (2,4) ] but (2,5) was head, now body, and (2,4) is next, so new positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]? Since tail removed, the snake has segments: new head (3,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes first body, then (2,4) becomes second body, so positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] with head (3,5), body (2,5) and tail (2,4).\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection now R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5) dir R, can move R, U, D (not L).\n\n- R to (4,5)\n- U to (3,6)\n- D to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is below, and no food, but it might be free.\n\nMove D to (3,4): head to (3,4), no eat, so tail removed, tail was (2,4), so new positions: head (3,4), body (3,5) and (2,5)? Before move: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nMove to (3,4) no eat: new head (3,4), tail (2,4) removed, so body: previous positions except tail, so [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? New head (3,4), then the old head (3,5) becomes body, then (2,5) is next, so [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] with head (3,4), body (3,5) and tail (2,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen I can continue to (5,2).\n\nFor the answer, since I need to output actions, I can do up to turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut let's list actions for turns 0 to 4.\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 4: D (to (3,4))\n\nBut at turn 4, moving to (3,4), which is where the body was, but since no eat, it's ok.\n\nThen later to (5,2).\n\nSince the prompt says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nt1=0, so turns 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4) after above, positions [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] dir D.\n\nThen move R to (4,4) no eat, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the box, I can put a sequence.\n\nTo maximize score, eating early is good.\n\nAnother option: after eating (3,4) and (2,5), I could go directly to (5,2) by moving down and right.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) after eating, instead of moving R to (3,5), I could move R? Or from (2,5) dir U, I can move R to (3,5) or L to (1,5) or U to (2,6).\n\nTo go to (5,2), moving down is not possible directly, so moving right first is fine.\n\nI think the sequence is ok.\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nThen for turn 3, from (2,5) move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5) move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4) move R to (4,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the box, I can list turns 0 to 4 or 0 to 5.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I'll provide 5 actions: turns 0 to 4.\n\nActions: Turn 0: U, Turn 1: L, Turn 2: U, Turn 3: R, Turn 4: D\n\nIn terms of direction, after turn 2 U, direction U, so turn 3 R is perpendicular, ok.\n\nAfter turn 3 R, direction R, turn 4 D perpendicular, ok.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (5,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure about the obstacle and walls.\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, but I'm not going near it yet.\n\nAlso, borders are walls, so I should avoid x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7.\n\nIn the path, (3,5) is y=5, fine.\n\n(2,5) y=5, etc.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 4, I move to (3,4), which is the same as initial head position, but no issue.\n\nTo be more efficient, but I think it's fine.\n\nI could consider not eating (3,4) first to have more flexibility, but since it's positive, eating early is good.\n\nAnd with one segment, I can go anywhere easily.\n\nBut after eating, I grow, which might block paths, but in this case, with only a few segments, it should be ok.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will prioritize eating all available positive food, starting with the adjacent food at (3,4) to gain an immediate reward. I will then plan a path to eat the food at (2,5) and (5,2) within their life spans (10 turns each). Since the snake starts with only one segment, collisions are minimal initially, but I must avoid walls, the internal obstacle at (3,1), and prevent self-collision as the snake grows.\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 0)**: Move Up to eat the food at (3,4), gaining +1 score and increasing length to 2. This is efficient as (3,4) is adjacent.\n- **Path to (2,5)**: After eating (3,4), move Left (to avoid instant reverse) and then Up to reach (2,5) by Turn 2.\n- **Path to (5,2)**: From (2,5), move Right to (3,5) and then Down to (3,4) to position for an eastward path to (5,2). The food at (5,2) must be eaten by Turn 9 (life span 10, disappears at Turn 10), and the planned path arrives by Turn 8.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No instant reverse: After moving Up on Turn 0, direction is U, so Down is forbidden on Turn 1. Similarly, after other moves, perpendicular moves are safe.\n  - Wall and obstacle: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and (3,1) are avoided in the path.\n  - Collision: With short length, self-collision is unlikely. After growth, movements are planned to avoid the body.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Eating all food quickly builds a score buffer. After Turn 4, the snake can continue to (5,2) safely. Life spans allow flexibility, but I prioritize eating (2,5) and (5,2) early to avoid decay risks.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 0 to 5):\n- **Turn 0**: Move U (Up) to (3,4) – Eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 2). Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,3)]; direction U.\n- **Turn 1**: Move L (Left) to (2,4) – No food. Snake positions: [(2,4), (3,4)]; direction L.\n- **Turn 2**: Move U (Up) to (2,5) – Eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 3). Snake positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]; direction U.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R (Right) to (3,5) – No food. Snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]; direction R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move D (Down) to (3,4) – No food (previously eaten). Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]; direction D.\n- **Turn 5**: Move R (Right) to (4,4) – No food. Snake positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]; direction R. (Continues toward (5,2) by Turn 8.)\n\n### Extended Path to (5,2) for Completeness (Beyond 5 Turns):\n- Turn 6: Move R to (5,4) – No food.\n- Turn 7: Move D to (5,3) – No food.\n- Turn 8: Move D to (5,2) – Eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 4).\n\nThis sequence eats all food by Turn 8, maximizing score (3 points) with minimal risk. If food spawns later, reassess after Turn 5.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: L\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: D\n}",

Let me confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly for y. But it says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so yes, walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), with (3,1) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), body at (3,3), so the snake is two segments long, moving upwards (head direction U).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,2) with life span 9, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 9, value +1\n\n- (3,6) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span given.\n\nCurrent turn is t=1.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid:\n\n- Rows y=0 to y=7, but walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y=1 to 6.\n\n- Columns x=0 to x=7, walls at x=0 and x=7, playable x=1 to 6.\n\nObstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (3,4), body (3,3). Moving U, so from (3,4) to (3,5) if it continues up.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,2): bottom-right area\n\n- (2,5): top-left area\n\n- (3,6): directly above the snake, since snake head is at (3,4), moving up, so (3,5) is empty? Let's see possible moves.\n\nCurrent head position (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction instantly.

D is forbidden because it's opposite.\n\nNow, what are the adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,5)\n\n- Down: (3,3) but that's the body, and also it's the tail, but let's see if it's safe.\n\nMoving to (3,3): since the tail will move, it might be okay, but I need to check if it's occupied or not.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,4), body (3,3). So (3,3) is the tail.\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), what happens? The head moves to (3,3), but (3,3) is currently occupied by the tail. However, since the snake moves, the tail will also move forward, so after the move, the tail is no longer there, so it should be safe to move to the tail cell, as long as no other body part is there.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, for collision: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail cell is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other cells.\n\nNow, let's list possible moves from (3,4):\n\n- U (up) to (3,5)\n\n- D (down) to (3,3) — but current direction U, moving D is opposite, so not allowed? Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so on next turn, cannot move D.\n\nTherefore, from (3,4), with dir U, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\n- U: to (3,5)\n\n- L: to (2,4)\n\n- R: to (4,4)\n\nD is not allowed.\n\nNow, check for walls and obstacles:\n\n- (3,5): x=3, y=5, between 1 and 6, not wall. (3,1) is obstacle, but (3,5) is fine.\n\n- (2,4): x=2, y=4, playable area.\n\n- (4,4): x=4, y=4, playable.\n\nAll seem safe from walls.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (5,2) not adjacent\n\n- (2,5) not adjacent\n\n- (3,6) is above, but not adjacent; (3,6) is two up from head.\n\nHead at (3,4), so (3,5) is empty, then (3,6) has food.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), I don't eat food yet, since food is at (3,6).\n\nThen next turn, if I move U again, I go to (3,6) and eat food.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nAlso, need to consider life span of food.\n\nAll food has life span 9 or 10, current turn 1, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I should plan a path to get food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nSince snake is short, only 2 segments, I can grow safely for now.\n\nBut need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, let's consider immediate action for turn 1.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), then head at (3,5), body at (3,4) now? After move.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, tail moves away or stays if food eaten, but no food eaten yet.\n\nSince no food eaten, snake moves, head to new cell, tail leaves previous position.\n\nSo after move to (3,5): snake positions: head (3,5), body (3,4). Tail was (3,3), but since moved without eating, tail segment is removed, so snake is now (3,5) and (3,4)? Positions: original [(3,4), (3,3)], move head to (3,5), so new positions: head (3,5), and the body segment that was (3,4) becomes the new tail? Let's think.\n\nSnake segments: index 0 is head, index 1 is tail.\n\nAfter moving without eating, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail is removed. So new snake: [new head position, then the previous head position].\n\nSo from [(3,4), (3,3)], if move U to (3,5), new positions: head at (3,5), and the body is now (3,4). So [(3,5), (3,4)].\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (2,4), new snake: [(2,4), (3,4)]? Original [(3,4), (3,3)], move head to (2,4), so new head (2,4), and the segment that was head is now body, so (3,4) becomes body, and tail (3,3) is removed? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is vacated. So the snake consists of the new head position and all body segments except the tail is removed.\n\nPositions: before move: [head, segment1, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move to new cell: [new_head, head, segment1, ...] but without the last segment if no growth.\n\nSince no food, length same, so the tail is removed.\n\nFor a snake of length 2: positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n\nMove head to C, new positions: [C, A]. B is removed.\n\nSo yes, after move to (3,5): snake is [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nAfter move to (2,4): snake [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nAfter move to (4,4): snake [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nNow, for turn 1, I need to choose action.\n\nBut I have to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,6), which is directly above.\n\nIf I move U now to (3,5), then on turn 2, I can move U to (3,6) and eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows: since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new positions: after eating at (3,6), head to (3,6), body still (3,5), and since growth, a new segment is added, so snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: snake at [(3,5), (3,4)] after turn 1 if I moved U.\n\nTurn 1: move to (3,5), snake: [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move to (3,6), which has food. Eat food, so head moves to (3,6), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the body remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position? Standard: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: before move to food: [ (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nMove head to (3,6), which is food. Eat it, so new head at (3,6), and the body segments remain, so snake becomes [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ].\n\nYes, length 3 now.\n\nThen head direction would be U, since moved up.\n\nNow, after that, I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,6), direction U, but y=6 is the top, since y=7 is wall, so (3,6) y=6, which is the top row, y=7 is wall, so moving U to (3,7) is impossible, wall collision.\n\nSo from (3,6), cannot move U.\n\nAlso, cannot move D because opposite direction? Current direction after moving to (3,6) is U, so cannot move D immediately.\n\nAllowed moves: L, R, or U but U not possible.\n\nL to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\nD not allowed because reverse.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, the grid: at (3,6), top row, so only left or right.\n\nBut I have to consider the body. Snake is [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ], so body at (3,5) and (3,4).\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), that might be ok, or R to (4,6).\n\nThen I can go down or something.\n\nBut there are other foods: (5,2) and (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5, which is left and down from (3,6)? (3,6) to (2,5) is not adjacent, need to move.\n\n(5,2) is bottom right.\n\nAlso, life span: all food has life 9 or 10, turn 1, so after 2 turns, turn 3, life span decreases.\n\nFood at (3,6) has life span 10, so on turn 1, it has 10 turns left, including current turn? Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists from turn t to t+L-1? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo when food is spawned, at that turn, countdown is N, and decreases each turn.\n\nWhen countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns\"\n\nBut with countdown decreasing every turn including current.\n\nSuppose food appears at turn T with life_span N.\n\nAt turn T, countdown = N\n\nTurn T+1, countdown = N-1\n\n...\n\nTurn T + (N-1), countdown =1\n\nTurn T + N, countdown=0, and it disappears after this turn, I think.\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span L, it will be there until turn t + L - 1 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n\nTypically in such games, if life_span is N, it appears at turn T and disappears at the end of turn T + N - 1, or something.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (5,2) with life_span 9 at turn 1.\n\nAt turn 1, countdown=9\n\nTurn 2, countdown=8\n\n...\n\nTurn 9, countdown=1\n\nTurn 10, countdown=0, and it disappears before turn 10 or after? \"Disappears after N turns\" — N=9, so after 9 turns from now, it disappears.\n\nAfter turn 9, it is gone for turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, with life_span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and gone at turn t + L.\n\nFor (5,2): life_span 9 at turn 1, so present turns 1 to 9, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5): life_span 9, turns 1-9\n\n(3,6): life_span 10, turns 1-10\n\nCurrent turn 1.\n\nIf I eat (3,6) on turn 2, as I thought earlier.\n\nTurn 1: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move to (3,6) and eat.\n\nThen on turn 2, (3,6) has countdown 10-1=9? At turn 1, countdown=10 for (3,6), turn 2 countdown=9, still there.\n\nBut I eat it on turn 2.\n\nAfter eating, it's gone.\n\nNow, back to the situation: after eating at (3,6), I'm at (3,6) with snake length 3: head (3,6), body (3,5), tail (3,4).\n\nDirection U.\n\nCannot move U (wall), cannot move D (reverse not allowed), so must move L or R.\n\nSay I move L to (2,6).\n\nThen new head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5)? Snake positions: after move to (2,6), no food, so head to (2,6), body: previous head (3,6) becomes body, and tail (3,5) becomes new tail, but (3,4) is removed? Positions before move: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nMove head to (2,6), no food, so new positions: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] and (3,4) removed.\n\nDirection now L, since moved left.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move L, D, U but U is wall? y=6, U to (2,7) wall, impossible.\n\nD to (2,5), which has food! (2,5) has food with value +1.\n\n(2,5) is food location.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), I can eat it.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nCurrent direction after moving L to (2,6) is L.\n\nMoving D to (2,5) is not opposite; opposite of L is R, not D.\n\nSo allowed moves from (2,6): L, D, R? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (2,7) wall, impossible.\n\nD to (2,5)\n\nL to (1,6)? x=1,y=6, but x=1 is playable, since walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6.\n\ny=6, same.\n\nL to (1,6), R to (3,6) but (3,6) is body now? Snake is at [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ], so (3,6) is body segment.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), that would be collision with body, since (3,6) is occupied and not the tail.\n\nTail is at (3,5), so (3,6) is body, moving to it would cause collision.\n\nSo cannot move R to (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, move D to (2,5): is (2,5) occupied? Currently, no, it's food, but not occupied by snake.\n\nSnake is at (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), so (2,5) is empty except for food.\n\nMove D to (2,5), eat food, then snake grows: head to (2,5), body remains, so new snake [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]? Before move: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nMove head to (2,5), eat food, so new head (2,5), and body: (2,6), (3,6), and tail (3,5) stays? Since food eaten, tail does not move, so positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]? No.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, head moves to new cell, and no segment is removed, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nPositions: before move: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove to D with food: new positions [D, A, B, C] — C is still there.\n\nIn this case, before move: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove to (2,5) with food, so new head (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, and all segments remain, so [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nYes, length 4.\n\nThen direction now D, since moved down.\n\nNow, from (2,5), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is if I choose that path.\n\nBack to turn 1.\n\nIf I move U on turn 1, I can potentially eat (3,6) on turn 2, then on turn 3 I can go to (2,5) or something.\n\nBut after eating (3,6), I'm at (3,6) with direction U, must move L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), then from there, I can move D to (2,5) to eat that food on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, there is food at (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is far, at bottom right.\n\nNow, another option: if I don't go up immediately, I could go left or right to get other food.\n\nFor example, move L on turn 1 to (2,4).\n\nThen snake: head (2,4), body (3,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen possible moves: from (2,4), dir L, cannot move R (opposite), so U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,5), which has food! (2,5) has food.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), eat food on turn 2.\n\nThen snake grows to length 3: before move: [ (2,4), (3,4) ]? After turn 1 move to (2,4), snake is [ (2,4), (3,4) ] assuming no food on turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: move to (2,4), no food there, so snake [ (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5), which has food, eat it, so new head (2,5), body (2,4), and since growth, tail remains, so snake [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move D (opposite to current U? Current direction after moving U is U, so cannot move D.\n\nAllowed: U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,6), which is empty? Currently, no food or snake there.\n\n(2,6) is empty.\n\nOr L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is empty, I think.\n\nSnake is at (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), so (3,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (3,6) later.\n\nBut (3,6) has food, life span 10, so I can get it later.\n\nIf I move R to (3,5) on turn 3, then from (3,5) I can move U to (3,6) to eat on turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (2,6) on turn 3, then from there I might go to (3,6) or down.\n\nBut let's compare the two paths.\n\nFirst path: move U on turn 1 to (3,5), then turn 2 U to (3,6) eat, then turn 3 move L to (2,6), then turn 4 move D to (2,5) to eat that food? But (2,5) might be eaten earlier or not.\n\nIn this path, when I move to (2,6) on turn 3, (2,5) is still there, life span 9, so at turn 3, countdown for (2,5) is 9 - (3-1)? At turn 1, life 9, turn 2 countdown 8, turn 3 countdown 7, still there.\n\nI can move from (2,6) to (2,5) on turn 4 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,2), I need to go there later.\n\nBut there might be a risk of getting stuck.\n\nAnother option: move R on turn 1 to (4,4).\n\nThen snake [ (4,4), (3,4) ], direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, R (cannot L, opposite).\n\nU to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4).\n\nFood at (5,2), which is down and right.\n\nI could go towards (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), so from (4,4), I need to go down.\n\nMove D to (4,3) on some turn.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,6); if I don't go up soon, it might not be reachable later or something.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can probably get all food, but need to plan a path that avoids dead ends.\n\nAlso, consider the obstacle at (3,1), which blocks the bottom row.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I should not corner myself.\n\nFor example, if I go up to (3,6) and eat, then I'm at top row, and with body below, I have to move left or right, which is fine, but if I go left to (2,6), then I can go down to (2,5) to eat that food, then from (2,5) I can go left to (1,5) or down to (2,4) but (2,4) is body? After eating (2,5), snake is at (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) or something.\n\nLet's simulate the first path.\n\nPath A: turn 1 move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 1: action U, snake to [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move U to (3,6), eat food, snake to [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] length 3, dir U\n\nTurn 3: cannot U or D, so move L to (2,6), no food, snake to [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] , dir L\n\nTurn 4: from (2,6), can move D to (2,5), eat food, snake to [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] length 4, dir D\n\nNow at (2,5), dir D, can move L, R, D? Cannot U (opposite), so possible D to (2,4), but (2,4) might be occupied or not. Snake positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), tail (3,5). So (2,4) is free.\n\nMove D to (2,4), but no food, so snake moves, head to (2,4), tail removed, so snake to [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]? Before move: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nMove head to (2,4), no food, so new head (2,4), body (2,5), (2,6), and tail (3,6)? (3,5) is removed? Positions: after move, [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) is body, but since no growth, tail removed, so new snake: [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ]? Let's index: old head (2,5), old body (2,6), old body (3,6), old tail (3,5)\n\nMove to (2,4), no food, so new head (2,4), new body segments: previous head and body except tail removed, so [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) is removed? The segment that was (2,6) is now body, (2,5) is body, and (3,6) is gone, (3,5) gone.\n\nSnake: [new head, previous head, previous body] but only if previous body exists.\n\nIn this case, from [A,B,C,D] with A head, D tail, move to E no food, new snake [E,A,B] and C and D removed? No.\n\nStandard: the head moves to new cell, and the tail is removed, so the new snake has all segments except the tail is gone.\n\nSo positions: old positions [P0, P1, P2, P3] with P0 head, P3 tail.\n\nMove to Q, no food, new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2] but without P3, so [Q, P0, P1] if length was 4, now 3? No, length decreases only if no growth, but in terms of positions.\n\nBetter to think of the list.\n\nBefore move: segments S0=head, S1, S2, S3=tail.\n\nAfter moving to new cell, new head is new position, and S0 becomes body, S1 becomes body, S2 becomes tail, and S3 is removed. So new segments: [new_pos, S0, S1, S2] but S2 was S2, not tail.\n\nFor a snake of length L, after move without eating, it has L segments: new head, and the first L-1 segments of the previous snake except the tail is removed.\n\nPrevious snake positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move to new cell N, no food: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ...] up to the second last, so [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}] where k is the index.\n\nEasier: the new snake has the new head position and all positions except the tail position is removed.\n\nSo for previous positions list, remove the last element, and add new head at front.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in this case, turn 4 after eating (2,5), snake at [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] — positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nNow move to (2,4) no food, so new positions: add new head (2,4) at front, remove tail (3,5), so [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]? Remove tail (3,5), so the positions become [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) is still there? No.\n\nList: previous positions: index 0: (2,5) head, index 1: (2,6), index 2: (3,6), index 3: (3,5) tail\n\nMove to (2,4), no food, new positions: new head (2,4), then index 0 becomes body, index 1 becomes body, index 2 becomes tail, index 3 removed.\n\nSo new: [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) is gone? Index 2 was (3,6), which becomes tail, but in the list, it's [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ] with (2,6) as tail, and (3,6) removed.\n\nBut (3,6) was a position, it is no longer part of snake.\n\nSo snake is now at (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) — all on x=2.\n\nDirection after moving to (2,4) is D, since moved down.\n\nThen from (2,4), dir D, can move L, R, D (cannot U opposite).\n\nL to (1,4), R to (3,4), D to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free, etc.\n\nBut I have food at (5,2) to get.\n\nAlso, (3,6) is already eaten.\n\nNow, back to turn 1 decision.\n\nIf I move L on turn 1 to (2,4), then turn 2 move U to (2,5) eat food, then turn 3 from (2,5) dir U, can move U to (2,6), or L to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n\nIf I move R to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can move U to (3,6) to eat that food on turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, I can get both foods.\n\nBut in this case, I get (2,5) first on turn 2, then (3,6) on turn 4.\n\nIn the first path, I got (3,6) on turn 2 and (2,5) on turn 4.\n\nSame foods, just order different.\n\nNow, for (5,2), I need to go there.\n\n(5,2) is at bottom right.\n\nFrom current position, if I go right on turn 1, I can head towards it.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move R to (4,4)\n\nThen snake [ (4,4), (3,4) ] dir R\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4), no food, snake to [(5,4), (4,4)] dir R\n\nThen from (5,4), can move U, D, R (cannot L)\n\nR to (6,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3)\n\nFood at (5,2), so I can move D to (5,3) on turn 3, then D to (5,2) on turn 4 to eat.\n\nBut (5,2) has life span 9, at turn 4 it is still there? Turn 1 countdown 9, turn 2:8, turn 3:7, turn 4:6, yes.\n\nThen I eat on turn 4.\n\nMeanwhile, (2,5) and (3,6) are still there, I can go back.\n\nBut the snake is growing, and the grid has limited space.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (3,1), so bottom row is partially blocked.\n\ny=1, x=3 blocked, so from (5,2), I can move to (5,1) or (6,2) etc, but y=1 is bottom row, walls at y=0.\n\nPlayable y=1 to 6.\n\n(5,1) is playable, but (3,1) is obstacle, so (5,1) is free.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nSince all foods are positive, I should eat as many as possible, but with long-term in mind.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (3,6) is directly above, and if I don't get it soon, it might be risky if the snake grows and blocks the path.\n\nBut since it's only two away, I can get it easily.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is close.\n\n(5,2) is farther.\n\nBut all have high life span, so no rush.\n\nHowever, to maximize score, I should eat food efficiently.\n\nBut the key is to avoid situations where I might die.\n\nFor example, if I go to the top and eat (3,6), I might get stuck if I'm not careful, but I can move left or right.\n\nIn the top row, I can only move horizontally, so I need to have an exit.\n\nSimilarly for edges.\n\nNow, for turn 1, moving U seems good to get the close food.\n\nBut let's consider the tail reward danger, but in this case, no food under snake or tail.\n\nSnake positions: (3,4) and (3,3), food at (3,6), etc, not under.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but here not the case.\n\nSo probably safe.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nLet's outline possible actions for turn 1.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (3,6) eat\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,6) dir U, move L to (2,6) (or R, but let's say L)\n\nTurn 4: from (2,6) dir L, move D to (2,5) eat\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,5) dir D, can move D to (2,4), or L to (1,5), or R to (3,5)\n\nEtc.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (2,4) on turn 1\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,5) dir U, move R to (3,5) (to go to (3,6))\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,5) dir R? After moving to (3,5), direction from (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so dir R.\n\nThen move U to (3,6) eat\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,6) dir U, move L or R.\n\nOption 3: Move R to (4,4) on turn 1\n\nThen turn 2: move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 3: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2) eat\n\nThen at (5,2) with longer snake.\n\nBut I have to go back for other food.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating (3,6) on turn 2 or (2,5) on turn 2 is similar, but (3,6) is closer to head now.\n\nHead at (3,4), (3,6) is distance 2 in y, (2,5) is distance |3-2| + |4-5| =1+1=2 Manhattan, same distance.\n\n(3,6): from (3,4) to (3,6) is 2 steps up.\n\n(2,5): from (3,4) to (2,5) is left and up, so 2 steps, e.g., L then U or U then L.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is farther, |3-5| + |4-2| =2+2=4 steps.\n\nSo (3,6) and (2,5) are both 2 steps away, (5,2) is 4 steps.\n\nBut with the direction constraint, for (3,6), since I'm moving U, I can go directly U U.\n\nFor (2,5), I need to go L and U or U and L.\n\nIf I move L first to (2,4), then U to (2,5).\n\nOr U to (3,5), then L to (2,5)? (2,5) from (3,5) is left, but from (3,5) to (2,5) is left, but (2,5) is not adjacent to (3,5)? (3,5) to (2,5) is adjacent, left.\n\nIn option 2, I did that.\n\nBut if I move U first to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can move L to (2,5) to eat, but (2,5) is food, so if I move to (2,5) from (3,5), I eat it.\n\nIn the first path, if I move U to (3,5) on turn 1, then on turn 2, instead of moving U to (3,6), I could move L to (2,5) to eat (2,5) food.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5), no food, snake to [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,5), can move U, L, R (not D)\n\nU to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\n(2,5) has food, so if I move L to (2,5), I eat it.\n\nThen snake grows to [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)] length 3, direction L.\n\nThen I can later go to (3,6) from (3,5), but (3,5) is now body.\n\nFrom (2,5), dir L, I can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), etc.\n\nThen to get to (3,6), I need to go to (3,5) first, but (3,5) is occupied by body.\n\nSnake is at (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), so (3,5) is body, so I cannot move to (3,5) because it's occupied.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move to (2,6), (1,5), or (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is free, for example.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4), but (3,4) is tail, moving to tail is safe if it moves.\n\nBut (3,4) is tail, so if I move to (3,4), it might be safe.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom (2,5), move D to (2,4), no food, snake moves to [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)] and (3,4) removed? Before move: [ (2,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nMove to (2,4) no food, new positions: [ (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) ] , dir D.\n\nThen from (2,4), can move to (1,4), (2,3), (3,4) but (3,4) is not occupied now, but (3,5) is body.\n\n(3,4) is free, I can move to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is empty, so move to (3,4), no food, then snake to [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ] or something, then I can move up to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by body.\n\nPositions: after moving to (3,4), snake [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ] with head (3,4), body (2,4), tail (2,5)? List: new head (3,4), previous head (2,4) body, previous body (2,5) tail, previous tail (3,5) removed? Before move to (3,4): snake [ (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) ]\n\nMove to (3,4) no food, new snake [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ] and (3,5) removed.\n\nThen from (3,4), dir R? Moved from (2,4) to (3,4) is right, so dir R.\n\nCan move U to (3,5), but (3,5) is not occupied, but in the previous state, (3,5) was removed, so it's free now? At this point, (3,5) is free, so move U to (3,5), no food, snake to [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ] etc.\n\nBut (3,6) is still there, I can move U to (3,6) from (3,5) on next turn.\n\nSo it's possible, but it takes more turns.\n\nIf I move directly to (2,5) on turn 2 from (3,5), I eat (2,5) but then (3,6) is harder to reach immediately.\n\nWhereas if I eat (3,6) first, I can then go to (2,5) easily.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, eating (3,6) first might be better because it's in the direction of movement.\n\nAlso, (3,6) has life span 10, (2,5) has 9, so (2,5) disappears sooner, but both have plenty of time.\n\n(2,5) at turn 1 life 9, so it disappears after turn 9, so by turn 9 it must be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) by turn 10.\n\nBut with 8 turns to go, I can eat both.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat all three if possible.\n\n(5,2) at (5,2), which is bottom right.\n\nFrom current position, I need to go there.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) and (2,5) first, I'm on the left side, then I need to go right and down to (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,2) first, I'm on the bottom right.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (3,1), the bottom row has a block, but (5,2) is not on bottom row.\n\ny=2, so it's row 2.\n\nI should choose a path that allows me to access all areas.\n\nFor turn 1, moving U seems reasonable to get the food above.\n\nMoving L to get (2,5) is also good.\n\nMoving R towards (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is farther, so I can get the close ones first.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,6) is directly above, so moving U is natural.\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,6), I can move left to (2,6) then down to (2,5) to eat that, which is efficient.\n\nIf I move L first, I eat (2,5) but then (3,6) is not directly accessible, and I waste moves.\n\nSo probably moving U on turn 1 is better.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (5,2) after.\n\nBut for now, let's decide turn 1 action.\n\nI think U is good.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the question is to output actions starting from turn t1 for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nLet's see the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1\n...\n}\n\nAnd it says \"where each action\", but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably for a few turns, but since it says think 5+ turns ahead, I should output at least 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state might change, so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nSince I have to output the actions, I can output for, say, 5 turns.\n\nBut after each move, the state changes, so for the response, I can provide a sequence based on current state.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I might need to re-plan, but for this, I think provide a plan for multiple turns.\n\nLet's make a plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (3,6) eat food\n\nTurn 3: move L to (2,6)  (since from (3,6), only L or R, I choose L to go towards (2,5))\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,5) eat food\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,5), direction D (since moved down), so can move L, R, D (not U)\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\nNow, (3,5) might be occupied or not. After turn 4, snake is after eating (2,5), so positions: before turn 4 move, snake at [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] after turn 3 move to (2,6).\n\nTurn 3: moved L to (2,6), no food, snake to [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,5), eat food, so new snake: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] length 4\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), move to say (2,4) to go down, or to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by body? Snake has (3,5) as a segment, so (3,5) is occupied, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is body, etc.\n\nFree cells: (2,4), (1,5), (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, so only (2,4) and (1,5) are free? Adjacent to (2,5): (2,4) down, (2,6) up but occupied, (1,5) left, (3,5) right occupied.\n\n(1,5) is free, (2,4) free.\n\nAlso, (3,5) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,4) or L to (1,5)\n\nI can move D to (2,4) for example.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for the output, I need to specify actions.\n\nSince the food at (5,2) is still there, after turn 5, I can head towards it.\n\nBut for the plan, I can output up to turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose other first move.\n\nBut I think U is fine.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo for turn 1, move U.\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U (to eat (3,6))\n\nTurn 3: L (to (2,6))\n\nTurn 4: D (to eat (2,5))\n\nThen turn 5: for example, D to (2,4) or L to (1,5), but since I need to go to (5,2), moving down might be better.\n\n(2,4) is down, then I can go right.\n\nBut let's not specify turn 5 yet, or I can choose.\n\nIn the answer, I should output actions for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns.\n\nBut after turn 4, the state changes, so for turn 5, it depends.\n\nSince the instruction is to think ahead but output for current turns, I'll provide the actions.\n\nMoreover, in the core rules, it says \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I should have a path to survive.\n\nFor example, after eating the two foods, I should not be trapped.\n\nWith snake length 4, grid 6x6 with obstacles, plenty of space.\n\nI can go to (5,2) later.\n\nFor instance, from (2,5) after turn 4, move D to (2,4), then R to (3,4), etc., towards (5,2).\n\nBut for the plan, I'll output for turns 1 to 4 or 5.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating early might be better to grow and have more space, but since short, not urgent.\n\nI think moving U on turn 1 is good.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating available positive food while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The current state (turn 1) has the snake at [(3,4), (3,3)] moving upward (U), with food at (5,2), (2,5), and (3,6). All food is positive (+1 score, +1 length when eaten) with sufficient life spans (9 or 10 turns), so there is no immediate rush. However, eating the closest food efficiently reduces risk and sets up for future moves.\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turns 1-2)**: The food at (3,6) is directly above the head (distance 2) and aligned with the current direction (U). Moving up twice (U on turn 1, U on turn 2) eats this food on turn 2, growing the snake to length 3. This is efficient and avoids unnecessary turns.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: After eating (3,6), the snake is at the top row (y=6) and cannot move up (wall) or down (reverse not allowed). Moving left (L) to (2,6) on turn 3 avoids the body and positions the snake to eat (2,5) next.\n- **Eating Second Food (Turns 3-4)**: From (2,6), moving down (D) to (2,5) on turn 4 eats the food at (2,5), growing the snake to length 4. This uses the proximity to (2,5) and avoids delays.\n- **Long-Term Survival (Beyond Turn 5)**: After eating (2,5), the snake is at (2,5) moving down (D). From here, moving down to (2,4) on turn 5 keeps the snake centered and avoids edges, allowing flexibility to reach (5,2) later. The grid has space, and no imminent dead ends are created. The food at (5,2) can be targeted after turn 5 by moving right/down, but this sequence focuses on the first 5 turns.\n- **Why Not Other Moves?**:\n  - Moving left (L) on turn 1 toward (2,5) is possible but less efficient; it would eat (2,5) on turn 2 but make reaching (3,6) harder due to body blocks, requiring extra moves.\n  - Moving right (R) on turn 1 toward (5,2) is inefficient; (5,2) is farther (distance 4), and delaying closer food risks the snake growing and blocking paths.\n- **Collision and Constraint Checks**:\n  - All moves respect the no-reverse rule (e.g., no down move after U).\n  - Wall and obstacle checks: (3,1) is blocked, but moves avoid it.\n  - Body collision: Moving to the tail is safe (e.g., not an issue here), and no food is under the snake.\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has high life span (9 or 10), so no food expires within the first 5 turns. (2,5) disappears after turn 9, and (5,2) after turn 9, so they can be eaten later.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 1-5):\nThis sequence eats two foods by turn 4, growing to length 4, and sets up for (5,2) while keeping the snake safe and centered.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U (up)  \nTurn 2: U (up)  \nTurn 3: L (left)  \nTurn 4: D (down)  \nTurn 5: D (down)  \n}\n\n### Detailed Turn-by-Turn Execution:\n- **Turn 1 (t=1)**: Move U to (3,5). Snake now at [(3,5), (3,4)]. Direction: U. Food unchanged. (No food eaten.)\n- **Turn 2 (t=2)**: Move U to (3,6). Eat food (+1 score, length +1). Snake now at [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. Direction: U. Food at (3,6) removed.\n- **Turn 3 (t=3)**: Move L to (2,6). Snake now at [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]. Direction: L. (No food eaten; (2,5) is close but not adjacent.)\n- **Turn 4 (t=4)**: Move D to (2,5). Eat food (+1 score, length +1). Snake now at [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]. Direction: D. Food at (2,5) removed.\n- **Turn 5 (t=5)**: Move D to (2,4). Snake now at [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]. Direction: D. (No food eaten; positions snake to move right/down toward (5,2) in future turns.)\n\n### Beyond Turn 5:\n- From (2,4) moving D, the snake can head toward (5,2) via moves like R to (3,4), then down/right. The path is open, and the snake can avoid the obstacle at (3,1) by staying above y=2 initially. With 5+ turns of planning, this sequence ensures survival and sets up for high scores.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t=2. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), body at (3,4). So the snake is two segments long, vertical, head at (3,5) pointing up. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life spans are given: for (5,2) and (2,5), life span 8, meaning they disappear after 8 turns including the current one, so they last until turn 10 (since current turn is 2, 2+8-1=9? Let me clarify the life span countdown.\n\nThe life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N - 1? Or at the end of turn t + N?\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, at turn t, when food is present, life span is N. After the turn, life span becomes N-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0, I assume.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span N. After turn t, it's N-1. So it exists as long as life span > 0. When life span is 1, it can be eaten on that turn, and then disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N turns starting from now.\n\nI think it's better to think: at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L more turns, so it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1.\n\nFor food at (5,2): turn 2, life span 8, so it exists from turn 2 to turn 9 (since 2+8-1=9? Turns: turn 2: life span 8, turn 3: life span 7, ..., turn 9: life span 1, turn 10: gone. So from turn 2 to turn 9 inclusive, that's 8 turns: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5): life span 8, exists turns 2-9.\n\n(3,6): life span 9, exists turns 2-10 (turns 2 to 10 inclusive: 9 turns).\n\nNow, snake is at (3,5) head, (3,4) tail. Head direction up.\n\nAvailable moves: since head is moving up, I can go U, L, or R, but not D because no instant reverse. So possible actions: U (up, y+1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nNow, let's see the grid positions.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (3,5), tail (3,4). So if I move up to (3,6), that's where food is! (3,6) has food with value 1.\n\nIf I go up to (3,6), I eat the food there. Since it's positive food, snake length increases by one, so after eating, snake will have positions: new head at (3,6), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail (3,4) is still there, so snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)], length 3.\n\nBut I need to check for collisions or dangers.\n\nMoving to (3,6): is it a wall? (3,6) is within bounds, x=3,y=6, not a border wall. Border walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (3,6) is fine. Internal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant. So no wall.\n\nIs there body collision? Currently, snake occupies (3,5) and (3,4). (3,6) is empty except for food. But food can be under body only if it was spawned there, but in this case, (3,6) is not under snake; snake is at (3,5) and (3,4), so (3,6) is free.\n\nFood at (3,6) is on an empty cell, I think.\n\nSnake positions are given, so (3,6) is not occupied by snake, so it's free cell with food.\n\nSo moving to (3,6) should be safe and I eat the food.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\". It says if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nWhat does \"tail cell has positive food\" mean? The tail segment is on a cell that has food?\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,4). Is there food at (3,4)? Looking at food positions, no food listed at (3,4), only (5,2), (2,5), (3,6). So (3,4) has no food.\n\nTherefore, no issue.\n\nAlso, after moving, when I eat, the tail doesn't grow immediately; I think when I move to a food cell, I eat it, and the growth happens after the move. But in terms of collision, since the tail moves after I move the head.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n\nIn this rule, it says: for positive food, length +1, meaning after eating, snake grows.\n\nBut for collision, when I move head to a cell, if it's not occupied by body or wall, it's ok.\n\nAfter moving, if I ate food, the new tail is added, but the head is already there.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,6): cell is free, so no collision. Then I eat the food, so next turn, when I move, the tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nBut for immediate turn, it's safe.\n\nNow, are there risks? I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (3,6) has life span 9, so it will be there for a while, but since I can eat it now, why not?\n\nBut I should consider other options.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,6), eat food, grow to length 3.\n\n- L: left to (2,5). (2,5) has food? Yes, (2,5) has food with value 1.\n\n- R: right to (4,5). (4,5) is empty, no food.\n\n- D: down to (3,4), but (3,4) is the tail. Now, can I move to tail? Generally, moving to tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so no collision, as long as it's not a permanent obstacle.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (3,4) is possible. But (3,4) has no food, so I just move there, no growth.\n\nNow, if I move to (3,4), since it's the tail, and I move there, the head goes to (3,4), and tail was at (3,4), but when I move head to (3,4), since it's the same cell as tail, but tail will move? Let's think.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4). If I move down to (3,4), which is currently occupied by tail.\n\nBut according to rule, it's allowed because tail will move forward. After move, head is at (3,4), and since I didn't eat food, tail moves away, so new positions: head at (3,4), and tail was at (3,4) but since head moved there, and no growth, the tail segment is removed? Standard snake movement.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, tail moves one step, so the last segment is removed.\n\n- If food, tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added where tail was, effectively growing.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,4): since (3,4) is the tail cell, and no food there, so after move, head is at (3,4), and the previous tail is gone, but since head moved to tail position, and tail was only one segment, now snake has only head? Positions: before move: [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nAfter moving down to (3,4): the head moves to (3,4), which was the tail position. Since no food eaten, the tail should move, but there is no next segment; tail was at (3,4), and it needs to move, but since no growth, the tail segment is removed, so snake should now be just [(3,4)], but that can't be right because moving to tail should be possible without dying.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nTypically, in snake games, when you move to the tail cell, since the tail will move away at the same time, the head can occupy that cell without collision. After the move, the tail is no longer there, so the cell is free for head.\n\nSo in this case: positions before: head (3,5), body/tail (3,4)\n\nMove head down to (3,4). Since (3,4) is occupied by tail, but it's allowed.\n\nAfter move: head is now at (3,4), and since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so the snake now consists of just the head at (3,4)? But originally there was a body segment.\n\nLet's list positions.\n\nBefore turn: segments: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: tail (3,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4): new head position is (3,4).\n\nSince no food, the tail segment (which was at (3,4)) is removed, but now head is at (3,4), and there is no other segment, so snake should be [(3,4)].\n\nBut that means the snake has shrunk to length 1? That doesn't make sense; it should stay length 2, but the tail moved.\n\nI think I'm messing up.\n\nStandard way: when head moves to a new position:\n\n- If the new position is not food, then the head moves to new cell, and the tail segment is removed (so the last segment is cut off).\n\n- If the new position is food, head moves to new cell, tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, increasing length.\n\nIn the case where new position is the current tail position:\n\nFor example, head at A, tail at B.\n\nIf head moves to B, and B is not food, then after move, head is at B, and since no food, tail is removed. But tail was at B, so removing it means no segment at B, and head is at B, so snake becomes just head at B, length 1? But that would mean the body disappeared.\n\nThat can't be right for a snake of length 2.\n\nPerhaps for a snake of length 2, moving to the tail cell is like the head and tail swapping positions.\n\nBefore: head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nAfter moving down to (3,4): new head at (3,4), and since no food, the tail (which was at (3,4)) is removed, but now head is at (3,4), and there is no tail, so only one segment.\n\nBut in terms of positions, the snake now occupies only (3,4), so it has length 1.\n\nBut that seems odd; typically, in snake, when you have two segments and you move towards the tail, it should still be length 2 with head and tail at new positions.\n\nI think I need to clarify the movement.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo in this case, when head moves to tail cell, the tail moves forward, meaning to where the head was? Let's think carefully.\n\nPositions: let's denote S[0] = head, S[1] = segment 1, ..., S[k-1] = tail.\n\nWhen moving, new head position based on direction.\n\nThen, if no food eaten, the tail is removed (last segment), so segments shift: new S[0] = new head, S[1] = old S[0], ..., up to S[k-2] = old S[k-2], and tail is removed.\n\nFor k=2: S[0] = head, S[1] = tail.\n\nIf head moves to a new cell not tail, say to C, then if no food, new head at C, new tail at old head position, so positions [C, old head].\n\nIf head moves to the current tail position, which is S[1].\n\nThen new head at S[1]. Since no food, tail is removed. But S[1] was the tail, so after removing tail, the snake has only the head at S[1], so length 1.\n\nBut that means the snake shortens, which is not desirable.\n\nIf there is food at the tail cell, but in this case no food.\n\nPerhaps for length 2, moving to tail is allowed and the snake remains length 2 with positions swapped.\n\nI think there's ambiguity, but the rule says \"the tail will also move forward\", so for length 2, when head moves to tail cell, the tail moves to the previous head position, so new positions: head at old tail, tail at old head.\n\nSo for (3,5) to (3,4): head moves to (3,4), tail moves to (3,5), so snake is now [(3,4), (3,5)].\n\nYes, that makes sense for no collision and length unchanged.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food at tail, but not here.\n\nSo in general, moving to tail cell is safe and snake positions are updated accordingly.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nAt turn 2, possible actions:\n\n- U: to (3,6) - has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 3: positions [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\n- L: to (2,5) - has food, so eat it, snake grows: new head (2,5), then (3,5) becomes body, tail (3,4), so [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\n- R: to (4,5) - no food, so just move, snake positions: head to (4,5), tail to (3,5)? Since no food, tail moves to old head position.\n\nPositions before: [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nMove R to (4,5): new head at (4,5), since no food, tail is removed and new tail is old head (3,5)? No.\n\nStandard: when head moves to new position, if no food, the tail segment is removed, and the new segments are: new head, then all old segments except the last one.\n\nSo for [(3,5), (3,4)], move R to (4,5): new positions: head at (4,5), and the body is old head (3,5), so [(4,5), (3,5)], and tail was (3,4) is removed, so snake is now [(4,5), (3,5)], length 2.\n\n- D: to (3,4) - as above, head to (3,4), tail to (3,5), so [(3,4), (3,5)], length 2, no food.\n\nNow, I need to choose an action for turn 2.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size 8x8, walls at borders and (3,1) obstacle.\n\nFood at:\n\n- F1: (5,2), life span 8, exists turns 2-9\n\n- F2: (2,5), life span 8, exists turns 2-9\n\n- F3: (3,6), life span 9, exists turns 2-10\n\nSnake at (3,5) head up.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), I eat F3 immediately, grow to length 3.\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nHead direction now up.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, L, R (not D, since up, can't go down immediately).\n\nU: to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nL: to (2,6)\n\nR: to (4,6)\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) are both empty, no food.\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), then positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)? After eating at (3,6), snake is [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nMove L to (2,6): new head (2,6), no food there, so tail moves: remove tail (3,4), new positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? Segments: new head (2,6), then old head (3,6) becomes body, and old body (3,5) becomes tail. Since no growth, the last segment (3,4) is removed.\n\nSo positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nSimilarly, if go R to (4,6): [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nFrom (2,6), head can go U, D, L, R, but not reverse, so since moved left, head direction is L, so can't go R immediately.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first for turn 2.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5) at turn 2.\n\nMove L to (2,5), eat food F2, grow to length 3: positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction left.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: L, U, D (not R, since left, can't go right).\n\nL: to (1,5)\n\nU: to (2,6)\n\nD: to (2,4)\n\n(1,5) is not wall, x=1>0, y=5.\n\n(2,6) empty, (2,4) empty.\n\nIf go R to (4,5) at turn 2: no food, move to (4,5), positions [(4,5), (3,5)], tail (3,4) removed, so length 2, head at (4,5), direction right.\n\nThen from there, can go U, D, R (not L).\n\nU: (4,6), D: (4,4), R: (5,5)\n\nOr go D to (3,4) at turn 2: move to (3,4), which was tail, so positions become [(3,4), (3,5)], head at (3,4), direction down.\n\nThen from there, can go U, L, R (not D, since down, can't go up).\n\nU: to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body? Positions: [(3,4), (3,5)], so (3,5) is the tail? S[0] = head (3,4), S[1] = tail (3,5)\n\nIf move U to (3,5), which is tail position. Since no food (assuming), new head at (3,5), and tail moves to old head (3,4)? As per earlier logic.\n\nMove U to (3,5): new head at (3,5), which was tail, and since no food, tail is removed and new tail is old head (3,4)? But (3,4) is where head was.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,5), and the body is old head (3,4), so [(3,5), (3,4)], which is the same as before but swapped, length 2.\n\nNo growth.\n\nBut not useful.\n\nSo back to turn 2 choices.\n\nEating the food at (3,6) seems good because it's close and I can eat it now.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThere is food at (5,2) and (2,5), which are farther.\n\nIf I eat (3,6) now, I grow to length 3, but then I'm at (3,6), which is near the top wall.\n\ny=6, and wall at y=7, so I can only go left or right from there.\n\nIf I go left to (2,6), then I can go down or left, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,5) first, I eat that food, grow, and I'm at (2,5), which is left side.\n\nOr if I go to (4,5), no food, but then I can go towards (5,2) or other.\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), which is low y, near bottom.\n\ny=2, and wall at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nNow, life spans: all food has life span at least 8, so plenty of time, since current turn 2, they last until turn 9 or 10.\n\nBut I need to plan a path to eat multiple foods.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so it might be harder to maneuver.\n\nCurrent length 2, so small, easy to move.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually in coordinates, y increases up, but in terms of movement, U is y+1, so higher y is up.\n\nBut for visualization, I can think y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo (3,1) is blocked.\n\nFood:\n\n- F1: (5,2) - bottom right area\n\n- F2: (2,5) - left middle\n\n- F3: (3,6) - top center, near snake head\n\nSnake head at (3,5), tail at (3,4), direction U.\n\nSince F3 is at (3,6), directly above, I can eat it immediately on turn 2 by going U.\n\nThen I grow to length 3.\n\nThen on turn 3, I need to move from (3,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), since U to (3,7) is wall, D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSay I go L to (2,6) on turn 3.\n\nThen positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5) — after move, if no food, tail (3,4) removed, so [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can go L to (1,6), U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, D to (2,5), or R but R is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,6), D to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food F2, but I might have eaten it or not.\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 2 I ate F3 at (3,6), so F2 at (2,5) is still there.\n\nIf I go D to (2,5) from (2,6), I can eat F2.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, x=2.\n\nFrom (2,6) going D to (2,5): that's down, y decreases.\n\nHead at (2,6), move D to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I eat it, grow to length 4.\n\nPositions before move: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nMove to (2,5): new head (2,5), eat food, so no tail move, add new segment at tail position.\n\nTail is (3,5), so new positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? Segments: new head (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, previous body (3,6) becomes next, previous tail (3,5) remains tail since growth.\n\nAfter eating, tail doesn't move, so the segments are: new head, then all old segments.\n\nSo from [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] move to (2,5), eat food, so new positions: head (2,5), then old head (2,6), old body (3,6), old tail (3,5), so [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nNow the snake has segments at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). (3,5) is tail.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction down (since moved down).\n\nNow, from here, I need to move. Possible moves: since moved down, can go L, D, R (not U).\n\nL: to (1,5)\n\nD: to (2,4)\n\nR: to (3,5) but (3,5) is tail position.\n\n(3,5) is currently occupied by tail.\n\nIf I go R to (3,5), which is tail, and no food there, so it should be safe; head moves to (3,5), tail moves to old tail position? As per rule.\n\nPositions: head (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\nMove R to (3,5): new head at (3,5), which was tail, and since no food, tail is removed, and new tail is the last segment.\n\nCurrent segments: S[0]=(2,5), S[1]=(2,6), S[2]=(3,6), S[3]=(3,5)\n\nMove R to (3,5): new head at (3,5), but (3,5) is currently S[3], tail.\n\nSince no food, the tail is removed, so new segments: new head at (3,5), then S[0] old head (2,5) becomes body, S[1] (2,6) becomes next, S[2] (3,6) becomes tail.\n\nSo positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction right.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's not go too deep; I need to think for turn 2.\n\nIf on turn 2 I go L to (2,5) directly.\n\nTurn 2: move L to (2,5), eat F2, grow to length 3: positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction left.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,5), can go L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4) (not R, reverse).\n\n(2,6) is empty, no food.\n\nIf go U to (2,6), then positions: head (2,6), no food, so tail removed, new positions [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]? Before move: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nMove U to (2,6): new head (2,6), no food, so tail (3,4) removed, new positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), tail (3,5) — [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead direction up.\n\nThen from (2,6), similar as before.\n\nI can go to (3,6) later, but (3,6) has food, life span 9, so it will be there for a while.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) first on turn 2, I eat F2, then I can go up to (2,6), then right to (3,6) to eat F3.\n\nFrom (2,6), after moving up, head at (2,6), direction U, so can go L, U, R (not D).\n\nU to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,6)\n\nR to (3,6)\n\nIf go R to (3,6), which has food, so eat F3, grow to length 4.\n\nPositions before: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] move to (3,6), eat food, so new positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) — [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead direction right.\n\nThen I have both foods.\n\nBut I also have F1 at (5,2) to consider.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat F3 first on turn 2, then go to F2.\n\nBut F2 at (2,5) is closer to (3,6) than F1 at (5,2).\n\n(3,6) to (2,5) is distance |3-2| + |6-5| =1+1=2, while to (5,2) is |3-5| + |6-2| =2+4=6.\n\nSo F2 is nearer.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle at (3,1), which might affect going to (5,2) later.\n\nBut (5,2) is at bottom, (3,1) is also bottom, but (3,1) is blocked, so to go to (5,2), I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go R to (4,5) on turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5), no food, positions [(4,5), (3,5)], length 2, head direction right.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,5), can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5) (not L, reverse).\n\n(4,6) empty, (4,4) empty, (5,5) empty.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), then to (5,4) or (5,6), etc, towards (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,1), so from (5,5) to (5,2), I can go down directly, since no obstacles in column, except (3,1) is at x=3, not x=5.\n\nx=5, y from 0 to 7, only borders, so (5,0) and (5,7) walls, but (5,2) is fine.\n\nSo from (5,5) to (5,2), I can go D, D, D to (5,2) in three moves, but need to avoid walls.\n\ny=5 to y=2, so down 3 times.\n\nBut snake might be longer.\n\nCurrently, if I go to (5,5) on turn 3, then turn 4 to (5,4), turn 5 to (5,3), turn 6 to (5,2), eat.\n\nBut on turn 6, life span of F1 is 8, from turn 2, turn 6 is within, since turn 2 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, F2 and F3 are also available.\n\nBut if I don't eat F3 now, it might be eaten later.\n\nSince F3 is very close, it's efficient to eat it now.\n\nAlso, by eating it, I grow, which might allow me to reach other foods faster or something, but growing makes the snake longer, which can be riskier in tight spaces.\n\nCurrently grid is open, length 2 or 3 is fine.\n\nAnother thing: the \"Tail Reward Danger\" but not applicable here.\n\nI should consider the risk of being near walls.\n\nFor example, if I eat F3 at (3,6), I am at y=6, near top wall, so I have to go left or right immediately.\n\nIf I go left, I can go to (2,6), then down to (2,5) to eat F2, as before.\n\nFrom (2,5), after eating F2, I can go down or left or up, but up is wall.\n\n(2,5) to (2,4), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut F1 at (5,2) is on the other side.\n\nSo I need to traverse the grid.\n\nSimilarly, if I start by eating F2 at (2,5), then I am at left, can go up to (2,6), then right to (3,6) to eat F3.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go right to (4,6), etc, towards (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), so from (3,6) to (5,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,1), so when going down, I need to avoid x=3 near y=1.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), go to (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), all fine, since x=5, no issue with (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, I can go down first then right.\n\nBut let's think about the path with eating F3 first.\n\nTurn 2: U to (3,6) eat F3, grow to length 3: positions [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction U, but just moved up, so for next turn, direction is U.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,6), can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6). Say I go L to (2,6), no food, so move: new head (2,6), tail removed (3,4), new positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,6), can go L to (1,6) or D to (2,5) (U wall, R reverse not allowed).\n\n(2,5) has food F2, so go D to (2,5), eat F2, grow to length 4: positions before: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] move to (2,5), eat, so new positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) — [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), head direction down, so can go L, D, R (not U).\n\nL to (1,5), D to (2,4), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by tail? Positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) — so (3,5) is tail.\n\nR to (3,5): move to tail position, no food, so head to (3,5), tail removed, new positions: head (3,5), then body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)? Current segments: S[0]=(2,5), S[1]=(2,6), S[2]=(3,6), S[3]=(3,5)\n\nMove R to (3,5): new head at (3,5), which is S[3], tail.\n\nNo food, so tail S[3] is removed, new segments: head (3,5), then S[0] (2,5), S[1] (2,6), S[2] (3,6) becomes tail. So [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction R.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods, length 4, at (3,5).\n\nFrom here, I can go towards F1 at (5,2).\n\nPossible moves: since direction R, can go U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (3,6) but (3,6) is occupied by tail? Positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — so (3,6) is tail.\n\nU to (3,6): move to tail position, no food, so head to (3,6), tail removed, new positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)? Segments: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nMove U to (3,6): new head at (3,6), tail removed, so new: head (3,6), body (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6) — [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nBut this is messy, and (2,6) is tail.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) is empty, I think.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) empty.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) should be empty.\n\nFrom (3,5), go D to (3,4): new head (3,4), no food, tail removed, new positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5) — [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] and (2,6) removed? Segments: before move, [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nMove D to (3,4): new head (3,4), no food, so tail (3,6) removed, new segments: head (3,4), then old head (3,5), old body (2,5), old body (2,6) but (2,6) was S[2], and S[3] tail removed, so new tail is S[2]? Old segments S[0]=(3,5), S[1]=(2,5), S[2]=(2,6), S[3]=(3,6)\n\nRemove tail S[3], so new segments: head at (3,4), then S[0] (3,5), S[1] (2,5), S[2] (2,6) becomes tail. So [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), (2,5) at (2,5), etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated, and the snake is tangled.\n\nTo avoid this, from (3,5), better to go R to (4,5) or D to (3,4).\n\nBut let's go back to turn 2 decision.\n\nIf I don't eat F3 immediately, I can go to F2 first or to (4,5).\n\nBut F3 is very close, and eating it gives score and growth.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating closer food is better for immediate score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term survival.\n\nAnother point: if I eat F3 at (3,6), I am near the top, and I have to move away, but I can go towards F2.\n\nSimilarly, F1 at (5,2) is far, but with life span 8, I can reach it.\n\nLet's estimate turns to reach F1.\n\nFrom current position (3,5), to (5,2): Manhattan distance |3-5| + |5-2| = 2+3=5, so at least 5 moves, but with snake movement, it might take more if I need to maneuver.\n\nFor example, turn 2: if I go R to (4,5), no food.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,5), go R to (5,5), no food.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,5), go D to (5,4), no food.\n\nTurn 5: go D to (5,3), no food.\n\nTurn 6: go D to (5,2), eat food.\n\nOn turn 6, I eat F1.\n\nLife span: F1 life span 8 from turn 2, so on turn 6, life span is 8-4=4? Turn 2: life span 8, after turn 2, life span 7, turn 3:6, turn 4:5, turn 5:4, turn 6:3, so on turn 6 it exists, I can eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat other foods first, it might take longer to reach F1.\n\nBut I can eat multiple.\n\nFor example, if I go to F2 first on turn 2: move L to (2,5), eat F2, grow to length 3.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) on turn 3, then R to (3,6) on turn 4, eat F3, grow to length 4.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go R to (4,6) on turn 5, then to (5,6) on turn 6, then down to (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) on turn 10.\n\nTurn 4: at (3,6) after eating F3.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), say go R to (4,6), no food, positions update.\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6), go R to (5,6), no food.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), go D to (5,5), no food.\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,4), no food.\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,3), no food.\n\nTurn 10: D to (5,2), eat.\n\nBut F1 life span: from turn 2, life span 8, so on turn 10, life span? Turn 2:8, turn 3:7, turn 4:6, turn 5:5, turn 6:4, turn 7:3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, turn 10:0? When it disappears.\n\n\"disappears after N turns\" with countdown including current.\n\nAt turn t with life span L, after turn t, life span L-1, and when life span 0, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span L, it can be eaten on that turn if L >=1.\n\nAfter eaten, it's gone.\n\nIf not eaten, at end of turn, life span decreases.\n\nWhen life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's: at the beginning of turn, if food has life span >0, it is present and can be eaten during the turn.\n\nAfter the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life span was 1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for F1 at (5,2), turn 2: life span 8, present.\n\nAfter turn 2, life span 7.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9, life span was 1, after turn 9, life span 0, so on turn 10, it is not present.\n\nIt can be eaten on turns when life span >0 at start of turn.\n\nTurn 2: L=8, present\n\nTurn 3: L=7, present\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: L=1, present, can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nTurn 10: L=0, not present.\n\nSimilarly for F2 and F3.\n\nF3 life span 9, so present until turn 10, can be eaten turn 10.\n\nBack to path: if I eat F2 and F3 first, I reach F1 on turn 10, but F1 disappears after turn 9, so on turn 10 it is gone, I cannot eat it.\n\nIn my sequence: eating F1 on turn 10, but turn 10 F1 is not present, since life span 0.\n\nF1 life span 8 from turn 2, so last possible turn to eat is turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: life span 1, present.\n\nTurn 10: gone.\n\nIn the sequence where I go directly to F1, I can eat on turn 6, which is fine.\n\nIf I eat F2 and F3 first, I might not reach F1 in time.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 2 eat F2 at (2,5)\n\nTurn 3 go U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 4 go R to (3,6) eat F3\n\nNow turn 4, at (3,6)\n\nFrom here to (5,2): |3-5| + |6-2| =2+4=6 Manhattan distance.\n\nWith snake length 4, it might take more turns.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), go R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: go R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: go D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: go D to (5,3) — but (5,2) is below, I need to go to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 8, go D to (5,3) on turn 8? Let's list turns.\n\nAfter turn 4: head at (3,6), positions say [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] after eating F3.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,6), no food, so tail removed, new positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5)? Segments: S[0]=(3,6), S[1]=(2,6), S[2]=(2,5), S[3]=(3,5) — move to (4,6), no food, tail S[3]=(3,5) removed, new: head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5) — [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6), go R to (5,6), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6) — [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]\n\n(2,5) removed? Tail was (2,5), removed.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), go D to (5,5), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), tail (3,6) — [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), go D to (5,4), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), tail (4,6) — [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), go D to (5,3), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), tail (5,6) — [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), I need to go to (5,2) on turn 9 to eat.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go D to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\n(5,2) has food F1, life span on turn 9: from turn 2 L=8, turn 9 L=1, present, so I can eat it.\n\nMove to (5,2), eat, grow.\n\nSo I can eat all three foods.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat F2 on turn 2, F3 on turn 4, F1 on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat F3 first on turn 2, then F2 on turn 4, then F1 on turn 9.\n\nTurn 2: U to (3,6) eat F3\n\nTurn 3: L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 4: D to (2,5) eat F2\n\nThen from (2,5), to go to (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5) after eating F2, positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] as before.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), say go R to (3,5) but (3,5) is tail, move to it, no food, new positions head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) — [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), go R to (4,5), no food, tail removed, new: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6) — [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), go R to (5,5), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) — [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), go D to (5,4), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5) — [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), go D to (5,3), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5) — [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3), go D to (5,2), but on turn 10, F1 is gone, life span 0.\n\nTurn 9: head at (5,3), I can go D to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 8: head at (5,4), on turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: head (5,4), I can go directly D to (5,3) on turn 8? Turn 8: from (5,4), go D to (5,3)\n\nBut (5,3) no food, so move.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,3), go D to (5,2) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nIn turn sequence:\n\nAfter turn 4: head at (2,5) after eating F2, positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), go R to (3,5) — move to tail position, no food, new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) — [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), go R to (4,5), no food, tail removed, new: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6) — [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), go R to (5,5), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) — [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), go D to (5,4), no food, tail removed, new: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5) — [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), go D to (5,3)? (5,3) is not food, I need to go to (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,4), go D to (5,3) on turn 8? Turn 8: at (5,5), go D to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), go D to (5,3), no food.\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,3), go D to (5,2), but F1 gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 8 position: head at (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go D to (5,3) on turn 8, then on turn 9 go D to (5,2), but turn 9 go to (5,2) eat.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,4) go to (5,3)\n\nBut (5,3) no food, so on turn 8 move to (5,3), positions update.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,3) go to (5,2) eat.\n\nYes, on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, in both cases, I can eat all foods.\n\nBut in the first sequence where I eat F3 first, I can eat F1 on turn 9 as well.\n\nSince F3 is closest, it might be better to eat it first.\n\nAlso, by eating it, I grow, which might be useful.\n\nBut for long-term survival, after eating all foods, I need to find more food, but there might be more spawning, but in this state, only these foods are given, so after eating, I need to survive, but with no food, I can keep moving.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating all is good.\n\nNow, for turn 2, I think going U to eat F3 is fine.\n\nBut let's see if there is any risk.\n\nWhen I move to (3,6), it's safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go left or right.\n\nIf I go left, I can eat F2 soon.\n\nIf I go right, I can go towards F1.\n\nBut F2 is closer.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,1) might not be an issue if I go to (5,2) directly.\n\nAnother thing: in the food list, all are positive, no negative.\n\nSo for turn 2, I think U is good.\n\nBut the answer needs to be for multiple turns, I think I need to output actions for turn 2,3,4,5,6, etc.\n\nThe format is to output actions starting from turn t1, for several turns.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nSince the future depends on choices, I need to plan a path.\n\nBut I can provide a sequence based on the plan.\n\nFor example, eat F3 first, then go to F2, then to F1.\n\nSo turn 2: U to (3,6) eat F3\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,6), I need to choose L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), then turn 4 D to (2,5) eat F2.\n\nThen from (2,5), I need to go towards (5,2).\n\nBut (2,5) is left, (5,2) right bottom, so I need to go right and down.\n\nWith snake length 4, I need to untangle or move efficiently.\n\nFrom (2,5), after eating F2, positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] as before.\n\nThen I can go R to (3,5) on turn 5, which is moving to tail, no issue.\n\nThen from (3,5), go R to (4,5) on turn 6.\n\nTurn 7: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: to (5,3) or directly to (5,2) if possible, but from (5,4) on turn 8, I can go to (5,3) on turn 8, then (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 8 from (5,5) to (5,4), then turn 9 from (5,4) to (5,3)? No, to (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,2) is two steps, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nSo from (5,4) on turn 8, go D to (5,3) on turn 8, then from (5,3) on turn 9, go D to (5,2) eat on turn 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R from (3,6) on turn 3, I might not eat F2, but F2 is there until turn 9, I can eat it later.\n\nBut it's farther.\n\nSo better to eat F2 soon.\n\nTherefore, for turn 2, go U.\n\nTurn 3, go L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 4, go D to (2,5) eat F2\n\nThen turn 5, from (2,5), go R to (3,5)  // move to tail\n\nTurn 6, from (3,5), go R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7, from (4,5), go R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8, from (5,5), go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9, from (5,4), go D to (5,3)  // but I need to go to (5,2)\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,2), I should go directly down.\n\nTurn 8: at (5,5), go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: at (5,4), go D to (5,3)  // (5,3) not food\n\nThen turn 10: to (5,2), but F1 gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 8, I should go directly to (5,4) on turn 8, but that's one step.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (5,4) go to (5,3)? No, (5,2) is at y=2, (5,4) is y=4, so to (5,2) I need to go to (5,3) then (5,2).\n\nBut (5,3) is empty.\n\nOn turn 9, from (5,4) go D to (5,3), then turn 10 to (5,2), but F1 gone on turn 10.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 9, head must be at (5,2).\n\nOn turn 8, head should be at (5,3) or (4,2) or (6,2), but (5,3) is adjacent.\n\nSo if on turn 8, head is at (5,3), then turn 9 go D to (5,2) eat.\n\nBut how to reach (5,3) by turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 4: head at (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: go R to (3,5)  // to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: go R to (4,5)  // to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: go R to (5,5)  // to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: go D to (5,4)  // to (5,4)\n\nThen on turn 8 at (5,4), not (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, I can go D directly to (5,4) on turn 7?

Turn 2: L=8, after turn 2 L=7, turn 3 L=6, turn 4 L=5, turn 5 L=4, turn 6 L=3, turn 7 L=2, turn 8 L=1, so on turn 8 L=1, present.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,3) go D to (5,2) eat on turn 8.\n\nYes, earlier.\n\nSequence: turn 2 U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 3 R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 4 R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 5 D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6 D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7 D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8 D to (5,2) eat F1\n\nAnd F2 is at (2,5), which I can eat after if time, but life span until turn 9, so on turn 9 I can go to (2,5), but from (5,2) to (2,5) is far, |5-2| + |2-5| =3+3=6, so from turn 8 at (5,2), turn 9 to (5,3) or something, not to (2,5) in one turn.\n\nSo I might not eat F2, but I ate F3 and F1, score 2, vs eating all three, score 3.\n\nBut in the first plan, I can eat all.\n\nIn the sequence where I eat F3 then F2 then F1, I can eat F1 on turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 4: at (2,5) after eating F2\n\nTurn 5: go R to (3,5)  // move to tail\n\nTurn 6: go R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: go R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: go D to (5,3)  // but I need to go to (5,2)\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 8, go D to (5,3) on turn 8? Turn 8 at (5,5), go D to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (5,4) go D to (5,3), not (5,2).\n\nTo reach (5,2) on turn 9, on turn 8 head must be at (5,3) or (4,2) or (6,2) or (5,1), but (5,1) might be wall or not, y=1, not wall, but (5,1) is above y=0 wall.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (5,1) is valid.\n\nBut no food.\n\nSo if on turn 8 head at (5,3), then turn 9 go D to (5,2) eat.\n\nHow to be at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 4 at (2,5), turn 5 go to (3,5), turn 6 go to (4,5), turn 7 go to (5,5), then on turn 7 at (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) on turn 7? Turn 7 at (4,5), go to (5,5) on turn 7.\n\nThen on turn 8, from (5,5) go D to (5,4), not (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, but on turn 7 I arrive at (5,5), so for turn 8 I move from (5,5).\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8, I need to be at (5,4) on turn 7 or (4,3) etc.\n\nLet's start from turn 4: head at (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: go D to (2,4)  // down\n\nTurn 6: go R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: go R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: go R to (5,4)  // not (5,3)\n\nTurn 9: go D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: to (5,2) gone.\n\nFrom turn 7 at (4,4), go D to (4,3) on turn 7? Turn 7 at (3,4) if I went that way.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5) go D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 6: from (2,4) go R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4) go R to (4,4) or go D to (3,3)\n\nSay go D to (3,3) on turn 7\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3) go R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 9: from (4,3) go R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: to (5,2) gone.\n\nNot reaching (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nTo reach (5,2) by turn 9, from (2,5) on turn 4, Manhattan distance |2-5| + |5-2| =3+3=6, so it takes 6 moves: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10 to arrive on turn 10, but turn 10 too late.\n\nMinimum 6 moves from turn 4 to turn 9 is 5 moves: turn 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nTurn 5: move 1, turn 6: move 2, turn 7: move 3, turn 8: move 4, turn 9: move 5, so after 5 moves, on turn 9, I can be at a cell 5 steps away.\n\n(2,5) to (5,2) is |3| + |3| =6, so on turn 9, I can be at (5,2) if I move directly, but 6 steps, so from turn 4 position, after 5 moves on turns 5 to 9, I can be at a cell within 5 steps, not 6, so I cannot reach (5,2) from (2,5) in 5 moves, since distance 6.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat F1 on turn 9 if I am at (2,5) on turn 4.\n\nTurn 4 is after move, so at start of turn 4, head at (2,5), turn 4 I move, so on turn 4 I can move to adjacent cell, like (1,5), (2,6), (2,4), (3,5).\n\nThen turn 5 to another, etc.\n\nTo reach (5,2) from (2,5), minimum 6 moves.\n\nSo on turn 9, after 5 moves from turn 4 to turn 8, I am at a cell 5 steps away, not at (5,2).\n\nOn turn 9, after moving, I can be at (5,2) only if I was at adjacent on turn 8.\n\nBut from (2,5) on turn 4, after 5 moves on turns 4,5,6,7,8, I can be at (5,2) on turn 8 or turn 9.\n\nTurn 4: move 1\n\nTurn 5: move 2\n\nTurn 6: move 3\n\nTurn 7: move 4\n\nTurn 8: move 5\n\nTurn 9: move 6\n\nSo on turn 9 after move, I can be at (5,2) if I move directly.\n\nFor example, turn 4 from (2,5) go R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 5 go R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 6 go R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 7 go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 8 go D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 9 go D to (5,2) eat on turn 9.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nIn this case, from (2,5) on turn 4, go right to (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), then down to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nSo for the plan:\n\nTurn 2: U to (3,6) eat F3\n\nTurn 3: L to (2,6)  // to go towards F2\n\nTurn 4: D to (2,5) eat F2\n\nTurn 5: R to (3,5)  // move to tail, no grow\n\nTurn 6: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,2)? (5,4) to (5,2) is not adjacent, so D to (5,3) on turn 8? Turn 8 at (5,5) go D to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 9 from (5,4) go D to (5,3)  // not to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4) go to (5,3), not (5,2).\n\nTo go to (5,2) on turn 9, from turn 8 at (5,5) go D to (5,4) on turn 8, then on turn 9 go D to (5,3), not (5,2).\n\nI need to go to (5,2) on turn 9, so from turn 8 head at (5,3) or (4,2) or (6,2) or (5,1).\n\nFor example, on turn 8 be at (5,3), then turn 9 D to (5,2).\n\nSo how to be at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 5 at (3,5), go R to (4,5) on turn 6? Turn 5: at (3,5) after move\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5) go R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) go R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) go D to (5,4)  // not (5,3)\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, go D to (5,4) on turn 7? But on turn 7 I am at (4,5), go to (5,5) on turn 7.\n\nThen on turn 8 from (5,5) go D to (5,4).\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8, on turn 7 I need to be at (5,4) or (4,3) or (6,3) or (5,2), but (5,2) is food.\n\nFor example, on turn 7 at (5,4), then turn 8 go D to (5,3).\n\nBut on turn 7, I am at (4,5) or (3,5), not at (5,4).\n\nFrom turn 5 at (3,5), turn 6 go D to (3,4)  // down\n\nTurn 7 go R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8 go R to (5,4)  // at (5,4) on turn 8\n\nThen turn 9 go D to (5,3)\n\nNot (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 8, go D to (4,3) on turn 8, then turn 9 R to (5,3), then turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (5,2) by turn 9 from (2,5) on turn 4.\n\nBut earlier with direct path from (3,6) to F1, I can eat on turn 8.\n\nAnd F2 can be eaten if I have time, but with life span until turn 9, from (5,2) on turn 8, to (2,5) is far, I can't reach in one turn, so I might miss F2.\n\nBut in the grand scheme, eating two foods is better than risking not eating F1.\n\nSince F3 is close, eat it, then go to F1 directly, eat F1 on turn 8, then if possible eat F2 on turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 8, to (2,5) on turn 9 is impossible, distance 6.\n\nSo I can eat F2 only if I go to it first or after F3.\n\nBut if I go to F2 first, I might not eat F1 in time.\n\nSo for maximizing score, eating F3 and F1 is guaranteed, score 2.\n\nEating F2 and F3 and F1 is possible only with careful timing, but from above, if I eat F2 and F3 by turn 4, I can eat F1 on turn 9 as shown in the first sequence with F2 and F3.\n\nIn the very first sequence I had:\n\nTurn 2 eat F2 at (2,5)\n\nTurn 3 go U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 4 eat F3 at (3,6)\n\nThen turn 5 go R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6 go R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7 go D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8 go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9 go D to (5,3)  // but to eat F1, I need to go to (5,2)\n\nOn turn 9 at (5,3), I can go D to (5,2) on turn 9? From (5,3) to (5,2) is down, but on turn 9 I move from (5,3) to (5,2), and if F1 is present, I eat.\n\nOn turn 9, F1 is present, life span 1.\n\nSo from (5,4) on turn 8, go D to (5,3) on turn 8? Turn 8 at (5,5) go D to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9 from (5,4) go D to (5,3), not (5,2).\n\nIf on turn 8 I am at (5,4), go D to (5,3) on turn 8, then on turn 9 from (5,3) go D to (5,2) eat.\n\nHow to be at (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 4 at (3,6), turn 5 go R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6 go R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7 go D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8 go D to (5,4)  // on turn 8 at (5,4)\n\nThen turn 9 from (5,4) go D to (5,3)  // not to (5,2)\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8, on turn 7 at (5,5) go D to (5,4) on turn 7? Turn 7 at (5,6) go D to (5,5) on turn 7.\n\nThen turn 8 from (5,5) go D to (5,4)\n\nStill not.\n\nFrom (5,6) on turn 6, go D to (5,5) on turn 6? Turn 6 at (4,6) go R to (5,6) on turn 6.\n\nThen on turn 7 from (5,6) go D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8 from (5,5) go D to (5,4)\n\nSame.\n\nTo go down faster, from (5,6) on turn 6, go D to (5,5) on turn 6, but that's one step down.\n\nI think it's not possible to reach (5,2) by turn 8 from (3,6) on turn 4 with only 4 moves.\n\nTurn 4 to turn 8 is 4 moves: turn 4,5,6,7, arrive on turn 7 or 8.\n\nAt turn 4 position, after 4 moves on turns 4,5,6,7, on turn 7 I can be at a cell 4 steps away.\n\n(3,6) to (5,2) is |2| + |4| =6, so on turn 7, I can be at most 4 steps away, not at (5,2).\n\nOn turn 8 after 5 moves from turn 4 to turn 8, I can be at (5,2).\n\nTurn 4: move 1\n\nTurn 5: move 2\n\nTurn 6: move 3\n\nTurn 7: move 4\n\nTurn 8: move 5\n\nSo on turn 8 after move, I can be at (5,2) from (3,6) if I move directly, but |3-5| + |6-2| =2+4=6, so 6 moves, so on turn 8 after 5 moves, I am at a cell 5 steps away, not at (5,2).\n\nFor example, at (5,3) or (4,2) etc.\n\nThen on turn 9 I can go to (5,2).\n\nBut on turn 9, F1 is present, so I can eat on turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: U to (3,6) eat F3\n\nTurn 3: R to (4,6)  // towards F1\n\nTurn 4: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 5: D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,2) but turn 8: from (5,3) to (5,2) on turn 8? On turn 7 at (5,4) go D to (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nTurn 7 at (5,4), go D to (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nThen turn 8 from (5,3) go D to (5,2) eat on turn 8.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,3) to (5,2) eat.\n\nAnd on turn 8, F1 life span: turn 2 L=8, turn 8 L=1 (after 6 decreases), so present, can eat.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd F2 at (2,5) can be eaten if I go to it, but after turn 8 at (5,2), on turn 9 I can go to (5,3) or other, but (2,5) is far, so I might not eat F2, but I have score 2 from F3 and F1.\n\nIf I want to eat F2, I need to include it earlier.\n\nBut for now, for the answer, I should provide a sequence.\n\nSince the question is to think 5+ turns ahead, I can provide actions for turn 2 to say turn 7 or 8.\n\nBut for turn 2, going U to eat F3 is reasonable.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can go right to F1.\n\nSo let's say:\n\nTurn 2: U to (3,6) eat F3\n\nTurn 3: R to (4,6)  // assume I go right\n\nTurn 4: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 5: D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,2) eat F1\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output from turn 2 onwards for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nThen on turn 6 at (5,4), then turn 7 D to (5,3), turn 8 D to (5,2).\n\nBut for the output, I can do for 5 moves.\n\nSince F3 is at (3,6), and I can eat it, and it has long life, but eating it now is fine.\n\nAnother option: on turn 2, go L to (2,5) eat F2, then turn 3 U to (2,6), turn 4 R to (3,6) eat F3, then turn 5 R to (4,6), etc to F1.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think U on turn 2 is good.\n\nSo for the answer:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will prioritize eating the positive food at (3,6) on turn 2, as it is adjacent to the snake's head and has a high life span. This allows for immediate growth and positions the snake to pursue other food efficiently. After eating, I will navigate towards the food at (5,2) to eat it before its life span expires on turn 9. The path avoids walls, obstacles, and potential collisions while considering the movement constraints. I have planned 7 turns ahead (turns 2 to 8) to ensure the snake eats both (3,6) and (5,2) safely, with the option to pursue (2,5) afterward if possible.\n\n### Detailed Plan:\n- **Turn 2 (t=2)**: Move Up (U) to (3,6) to eat the positive food there. This grows the snake to length 3, with new positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), tail (3,4). Head direction is now Up.\n- **Turn 3 (t=3)**: Move Right (R) to (4,6). This moves the snake away from the top wall (y=7) and towards the right side where (5,2) is located. No food eaten; snake positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5). Head direction is now Right.\n- **Turn 4 (t=4)**: Move Right (R) to (5,6). Continuing right to approach column x=5. No food eaten; positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (3,6). Head direction Right.\n- **Turn 5 (t=5)**: Move Down (D) to (5,5). Starting descent toward y=2. No food eaten; positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), tail (4,6). Head direction Down.\n- **Turn 6 (t=6)**: Move Down (D) to (5,4). Moving down; no food. Positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (5,6). Head direction Down.\n- **Turn 7 (t=7)**: Move Down (D) to (5,3). Nearing (5,2); no food. Positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5). Head direction Down.\n- **Turn 8 (t=8)**: Move Down (D) to (5,2) to eat the positive food. Life span of (5,2) is 1 on turn 8 (decreased from 8 at turn 2), so it can be eaten. Snake grows to length 4. Positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), tail (5,5). Head direction Down.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Immediate reward**: Eating (3,6) on turn 2 scores +1 and grows the snake, making it easier to reach distant food.\n- **Long-term survival**: The path avoids:\n  - Walls: By moving away from y=7 and staying within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: The internal obstacle at (3,1) is irrelevant here as the path is at higher y-values.\n  - Collisions: No body collisions; moving to the tail cell is allowed but not needed here. The snake is short, so tight spaces are manageable.\n  - Reverse moves: Direction changes respect the no-instant-reverse rule (e.g., after U, no D; after R, no L).\n- **Food life spans**:\n  - (3,6) eaten on turn 2 (life span 9, plenty of time).\n  - (5,2) eaten on turn 8 (life span 1, just in time).\n  - (2,5) has life span until turn 9. After turn 8, the snake at (5,2) can consider moving toward (2,5) if feasible, but it's risky due to distance (Manhattan |5-2| + |2-5| = 6, requiring 6 turns). Since (2,5) expires after turn 9, it may not be reachable, but eating two foods ensures a score of +2 with low risk.\n- **Efficiency**: The sequence minimizes unnecessary moves and heads directly toward high-value targets. Thinking 5+ turns ahead ensures (5,2) is reached safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U (up)\nTurn 3: R (right)\nTurn 4: R (right)\nTurn 5: D (down)\nTurn 6: D (down)\nTurn 7: D (down)\nTurn 8: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4). So the snake is three segments long, moving upwards. Head direction is U, which is up, so towards increasing y. Since y=0 is the bottom and y=7 is top, I assume? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, so (3,6) to (3,7) would be up, but y=7 is a wall, so moving up from (3,6) would go to (3,7), which is a wall, so that's invalid. Let me check.\n\nHead is at (3,6), direction U. U means (x, y+1), so next position would be (3,7). But y=7 is a wall, so moving up is not possible because it would hit the wall. Is that right?\n\nBorder cells: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so (3,7) is a wall cell, so moving up from (3,6) to (3,7) is impossible; it's a collision.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,6). Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\n- U: (3,7) - but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- D: (3,5) - but (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body. Snake positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), then (3,4). So (3,5) is the second segment, which is the body. If I move down to (3,5), that would be a body collision, right? Because the head touches the body segment.\n\nBut the rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (3,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,4). So (3,5) is a body segment that is not the tail.\n\nSnake segments: index 0: head (3,6), index 1: (3,5), index 2: (3,4) tail.\n\nIf I move to (3,5), that's where segment 1 is. After moving, the head goes to (3,5), and the body moves: the tail might move, but when the head moves to a new position, the body follows, so segment 1 would move to where the head was, but since the head is moving to (3,5), which is currently occupied by segment 1, that would cause a collision because head is touching segment 1 before the move.\n\nI need to think about how snake movement works.\n\nTypically in Snake, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no food is eaten, so the snake slides forward.\n\nSo, current positions: head at (3,6), body at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n\nIf I move up, but up is wall, invalid.\n\nIf I move down to (3,5), that is the position of the first body segment. After the move, the head would be at (3,5), and the body should move to the previous positions. Specifically, segment 1 would move to where the head was, (3,6), and segment 2 (tail) would move to where segment 1 was, (3,5)? But segment 1 is moving to (3,6), and the head is now at (3,5), so they are adjacent, but not colliding yet. However, since the head moved directly to (3,5) which was occupied, at the moment of move, head and body are on the same cell, which is a collision.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\" And it specifies that you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n\nBut here, (3,5) is not the tail; the tail is (3,4). So moving to (3,5) should be a collision because it's a body segment that isn't the tail.\n\nSimilarly, moving left or right.\n\nLeft: (2,6) - is that within bounds? x=0 is wall, so x from 1 to 6? Let's see walls.\n\nBorder cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, but y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nHead at (3,6), y=6. Moving up to y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nMoving down to (3,5): y=5, which is within 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 should be free, except for obstacles.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=1 is free, up to y=6 free, y=7 wall.\n\nSimilarly, x: x=0 wall, x=1 to 6 free, x=7 wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), which is within bounds.\n\nSo head at (3,6). Possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (3,5) - but occupied by body segment at index 1. Since it's not the tail, moving here causes collision. Rule: \"head touches any body segment\" except the tail under movement.\n\n- L: (2,6) - x=2, y=6. x=2 is between 1 and 6, y=6 is free? y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 should be free. No internal obstacle mentioned at (2,6), so possible.\n\n- R: (4,6) - similarly, x=4, y=6, should be free.\n\nAlso, direction: current head direction is U (up). But since we're moving, we can change direction, but with no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, which is up. Opposite is D, down. So I cannot move down immediately because that would be reverse.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction U, so I cannot move D on this turn.\n\nTherefore, possible actions this turn:\n\n- U: invalid, wall\n\n- D: invalid, because reverse and also body collision? But reverse is not allowed anyway.\n\nD is opposite to U, so not allowed due to no reverse rule.\n\nThen only L or R are possible.\n\nL: (2,6)\n\nR: (4,6)\n\nNow, food positions:\n\nFood: (5,2,7,1) and (2,5,7,1)\n\nFormat: (x, y, life_span, value)\n\nSo first food: (5,2) with life_span 7, value +1 (positive)\n\nSecond food: (2,5) with life_span 7, value +1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1.\n\nLife span 7, meaning they disappear after 7 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is t=3, so for each food, it will disappear at turn t + life_span? Life span is given as 7, so it has 7 turns left including turn 3? Or from now?\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, life_span 7, so it exists from turn 3 to turn 9 (since 3+7-1=9), and disappears at turn 10? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is L, then turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., when countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn or at the start?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases including current turn, at turn t, countdown is L, meaning it has L turns left, including this one. So after L turns, it will be gone.\n\nFor turn t, food with life_span L: it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so it disappears at turn t+L.\n\nIn this case, turn 3, life_span 7, so food exists until turn 9 (3+6=9? 3 to 9 is 7 turns: turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Turn 10 it is gone.\n\nSimilarly for both foods.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent snake: head (3,6), body (3,5), tail (3,4). Moving U, but can't.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nAfter moving, the snake will be: if I move L to (2,6), new head (2,6), then body at (3,6), tail at (3,5). Since no food eaten, tail moves away from (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if R to (4,6), head (4,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5).\n\nNow, food at (5,2) and (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is close to the left move, (2,6) to (2,5) is down, but I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's a internal obstacle at (3,1), which might affect pathing later.\n\nNow, I need to consider the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (3,4), head at (3,6), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1. So (3,6) and (3,5) are adjacent, but (3,5) is body, not tail. Tail is (3,4), so (3,6) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are two apart vertically.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nNow, let's think about getting to the food.\n\nFirst, food at (2,5): that's at x=2,y=5.\n\nFrom head (3,6), if I move L to (2,6), then I'm at (2,6), and (2,5) is directly below, so I could move down to (2,5) next turn.\n\nBut moving down: current direction after move? After moving L, the head direction would be L (left), I assume.\n\nSnake head direction is given as current, but after move, it changes.\n\nAfter action, the direction is set to the move direction.\n\nSo if I move L on turn 3, new head position (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 4, I can move U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so cannot move R (right, opposite to L).\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- U: (2,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (2,5) - free? Check: y=5 is between 1 and 6, no wall, no obstacle mentioned, and not occupied by snake? Snake after move: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5). So (2,5) is free.\n\n- L: (1,6) - x=1, y=6, should be free, but x=1 is not wall, walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 ok.\n\n- R: (3,6) - but (3,6) is now the body segment, so moving there would be collision with body, since it's not tail.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), the positions are: head (2,6), segment1 (3,6), segment2 (3,5). So (3,6) is the first body segment.\n\nIf I move to (3,6), that's where segment1 is, collision.\n\nSimilarly, tail at (3,5).\n\nSo from (2,6), moving D to (2,5) is possible, and (2,5) has food.\n\nFood at (2,5) with value +1.\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 4, I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (2,5), then body: since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new segments: head (2,5), then previous head (2,6), then (3,6), then (3,5)? Let's see.\n\nAfter move to (2,5) and eat food, positions: head moves to (2,5), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail stays, but the body extends.\n\nStandard Snake: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, body follows, but tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nSo previous positions: before move, head at (2,6), body at (3,6), tail at (3,5).\n\nMove head to (2,5), eat food, so new positions: head (2,5), then the previous head becomes first body: (2,6), then (3,6), then tail (3,5) stays, so now snake is [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? Order: head to tail.\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nThen next segment: where head was, (2,6)\n\nThen next: where first body was, (3,6)\n\nThen tail: where tail was, (3,5)? But (3,5) was tail, and it didn't move because food eaten.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added.\n\nPositions: before move: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] with head (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (2,5) with food: head to (2,5), then the body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was (2,6), and the second body segment moves to where first body was (3,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so tail was at (3,5), but new tail position: since the segment that was tail moves to (3,6)? Let's index.\n\nBefore move:\n\nIndex 0: head (2,6)\n\nIndex 1: body (3,6)\n\nIndex 2: tail (3,5)\n\nAfter moving down to (2,5) and eating food:\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nThen index 1: moves to previous head position (2,6)\n\nIndex 2: moves to previous index 1 position (3,6)\n\nAnd since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so new index 3: at the previous tail position (3,5)? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added, meaning the position that was tail remains occupied, and a new segment is created there.\n\nIn terms of positions, after move:\n\n- Head moves to new position: (2,5)\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo segment 1 (index 1) moves to where index 0 was: (2,6)\n\nSegment 2 (index 2) moves to where index 1 was: (3,6)\n\nAnd since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, which is now after movement, but the tail was at (3,5), and it moved to (3,6), so the new segment is added at the new tail position? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard behavior: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment stays in place, but since a new segment is added, the last position is duplicated or something.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: after moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nWith eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but the tail position is not vacated; instead, a new segment is added there, so the tail doesn't move, effectively.\n\nSo positions: after move with eat:\n\n- New head: the food cell\n\n- Then the previous head position\n\n- Then the previous body positions\n\n- And the previous tail position is still occupied, but it becomes the second last, with new tail at the same place? No.\n\nExample: positions before: H, B1, B2, T\n\nAfter moving to a food cell: new positions: H_new (food), H_old, B1_old, B2_old, T_old\n\nBut T_old is where the tail was, and it's still occupied, so the snake has an extra segment.\n\nIn this case, before move to (2,5): positions [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nAfter moving to (2,5) and eat: new positions: head (2,5), then previous head (2,6), then previous B1 (3,6), and since food eaten, the previous tail position (3,5) is still occupied by the new tail. But (3,5) is still there, so segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, (3,5) and (3,6) are adjacent, but that's fine.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nIf I move L on turn 3 to (2,6), then on turn 4 move D to (2,5), I eat the food at (2,5), snake grows to length 4.\n\nBut is there any danger? At (2,5), it's free, no issue.\n\nThen direction after turn 4 move: moved D, so direction down.\n\nNow, food at (2,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food at (5,2).\n\nLife span: both foods have life span 7 at turn 3, so they last until turn 9.\n\nTurn 3 to turn 9: 7 turns.\n\nTurn 3: present, countdown 7\n\nTurn 4: countdown 6, etc., down to turn 9: countdown 1, present; turn 10: disappears.\n\nSo until turn 9.\n\nNow, after eating (2,5), snake is at [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so cannot move U (up, opposite to D).\n\nU is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nPossible: D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nNow, (3,5) is the current tail position. If I move to (3,5), since it's the tail, and I'm not eating food there, it should be ok, because the tail will move away.\n\nCurrent tail is at (3,5). If I move head to (3,5), that would be moving to the tail cell.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAnd since no food there, tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIf I move R to (3,5), new head (3,5), then body moves: segment1 (was head) to (2,5), segment2 to (2,6), segment3 to (3,6), and tail (3,5) is vacated? Let's see positions.\n\nBefore move: head (2,5), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,5) with no food: head to (3,5), then B1 moves to (2,5), B2 moves to (2,6), and tail moves to (3,6)? Tail was (3,5), but head moved there, so B2 moves to where B1 was (2,6), and tail moves to where B2 was (3,6).\n\nPositions after: head (3,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nYes.\n\nIf I had eaten food, but no food at (3,5), so no growth.\n\nBack to turn 3 decision.\n\nI have another option: move R on turn 3 to (4,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to food at (5,2) or (2,5), but (2,5) is closer to left.\n\n(5,2) is at bottom right.\n\nNow, I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of trapping myself.\n\nFor example, after moving to (2,6) and then to (2,5), I have snake at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). The area around might be constrained.\n\ny=6 is top row, since y=7 wall, y=6 is highest free row.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), which is far away.\n\nBut let's consider the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with walls at borders.\n\nObstacle at (3,1), so row y=1, x=3 is blocked.\n\nNow, food at (5,2) and (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is near, but if I eat it, I might be in the corner.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move down to (2,4), left to (1,5), or right to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is now body or tail? After eating, positions: if I ate on turn 4, from (2,6) to (2,5), snake is [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nSo (3,5) is tail.\n\nIf I move right to (3,5), as above, it's ok, but then I'm at (3,5), with body at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6).\n\nThen from there, I can move, say, down to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut there's food at (5,2) to consider.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) immediately, I might go for (5,2) first.\n\nBut (5,2) is farther.\n\nLet's think about paths.\n\nFirst, if I move L on turn 3 to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 4, I can move to (2,5) to eat food, or move elsewhere.\n\nIf I move to (2,5), I eat, grow to 4.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (2,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nSay I move R to (3,5), then as above, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nDirection after move: R (right).\n\nThen on turn 6, from (3,5), can move U, D, L, R, no reverse, so cannot move L (left).\n\nU: (3,6) - but (3,6) is tail, so moving to tail cell is safe, since tail moves away.\n\nD: (3,4) - free?\n\nL: (2,5) - but (2,5) is body segment, collision.\n\nR: (4,5) - free.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n\nIf move U to (3,6), which is tail, new head (3,6), body: B1 to (3,5), B2 to (2,5), tail to (2,6)? Positions before: head (3,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nAfter move U to (3,6): head to (3,6), which was tail, so ok. Then B1 moves to (3,5), B2 moves to (2,5), tail moves to (2,6).\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), B1 (3,5), B2 (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nThen direction U.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut I need to get to (5,2) eventually.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nFrom current, it's far.\n\nIf I move R on turn 3 to (4,6), then I can head towards (5,2).\n\nFor example, from (4,6), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 4, can move U, D, L, R, no reverse, so cannot move L (left).\n\nU: (4,7) wall, invalid\n\nD: (4,5) free\n\nR: (5,6) free\n\nL: (3,6) but (3,6) is body? After move to (4,6), positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nSo (3,6) is body, moving to (3,6) would be collision.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves: D to (4,5) or R to (5,6).\n\nIf I move R to (5,6), then head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (3,6)? Positions: after move to (5,6) no eat, head (5,6), B1 (4,6), tail (3,6)? Before move: head (4,6), B1 (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,6): head (5,6), B1 moves to (4,6), tail moves to (3,6) — since no eat, tail moves from (3,5) to where B1 was (3,6)? B1 was at (3,6), moves to (4,6), so tail moves to where B1 was, (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) was occupied by B1, but B1 moves, so it's free, tail moves there.\n\nPositions after: head (5,6), B1 (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nThen direction R.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (5,6), can move U, D, L, R, no reverse, so cannot move L (left, opposite to R).\n\nU: (5,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (5,5) free\n\nR: (6,6) free\n\nL: (4,6) body, collision\n\nSo possible D or R.\n\nTo get to (5,2), I need to go down.\n\nSo move D to (5,5), for example.\n\nThen continue down.\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down 3 more steps from y=6 to y=2, but with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), but not in the way directly.\n\nBut the snake is small, so plenty of space.\n\nNow, back to turn 3, if I move L to (2,6), I can eat (2,5) on turn 4, but then I'm in the top-left area, and to get to (5,2) I have to cross the grid, which might take time, and food life span is 7, from turn 3 to 9, so 6 more turns after turn 3? Turn 3 to turn 9, 7 turns including turn 3, so from turn 4 to 9, 6 turns to eat.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) on turn 4, then on turn 5 I'm at (2,5) or wherever, then I need to go to (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (5,2), I can go right and down, e.g., (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), then down to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), which is 5 moves: turn 5 to (3,5), turn 6 to (4,5), turn 7 to (5,5), turn 8 to (5,4), turn 9 to (5,3), turn 10 to (5,2) but turn 10 food is gone, since disappears at turn 10.\n\nFood at turn 3 with life span 7: present turn 3,4,5,6,7,8,9; gone turn 10.\n\nSo to eat on or before turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 4 (after eating), on turn 5 I can move to (3,5) as before, then turn 6 to (4,5), turn 7 to (5,5), turn 8 to (5,4), turn 9 to (5,3), but (5,2) is at y=2, so from (5,3) to (5,2) is down, on turn 10, but turn 10 food gone, so I can eat on turn 9 if I go to (5,2) directly.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, I can go down to (5,4) turn 8, (5,3) turn 9, but (5,2) on turn 10, too late.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, I can go directly to (5,2) in fewer steps? From (5,5) to (5,2) is down 3 steps: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — so turns 8,9,10. Turn 10 too late.\n\nI need to be at (5,2) by turn 9 at latest.\n\nFrom current position after turn 4, if I ate (2,5), on turn 5 I'm at (2,5), then to (3,5) turn 5, (4,5) turn 6, (5,5) turn 7, then on turn 8 I can go to (5,4), turn 9 to (5,3), but not to (5,2). To reach (5,2) on turn 9, I need to be at (5,3) or (4,2) or (6,2) or (5,1) but y=1 is bottom, and obstacle at (3,1), but (5,1) should be free.\n\ny=1 is free except obstacle at (3,1), so (5,1) is free.\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, so to eat on turn 9, I need head at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 5 position after eating (2,5): on turn 5, if I'm at (2,5), I can move down to (2,4) instead of right.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), direction D, move D to (2,4), for example.\n\nThen positions: head to (2,4), no food, so body: B1 to (2,5), B2 to (2,6), tail to (3,6)? Before: head (2,5), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nAfter move D to (2,4): head (2,4), B1 to (2,5), B2 to (2,6), tail to (3,6) — B2 was (3,6), moves to where B1 was (2,6), tail moves to where B2 was (3,6).\n\nPositions: head (2,4), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen on turn 6, from (2,4), can move D, L, R (no U, reverse).\n\nD to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\nSay move D to (2,3), and so on down to (2,2), (2,1), but then to get to (5,2), I have to go right, which might take more turns.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (5,2) is right 3, up 1, but y from 1 to 2.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,1), so from (2,1), I can go to (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1) but (3,1) obstacle, so not possible.\n\n(3,1) is blocked, so from (2,1), I can go to (2,2), (1,1), or if x=1, (1,1) is corner.\n\nBut to reach (5,2), I need to go via higher y.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), I can go right to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut it seems tight to reach (5,2) by turn 9 if I eat (2,5) first.\n\nLet's calculate min moves.\n\nFrom head at (3,6) on turn 3.\n\nTo (2,5): 2 moves: L then D.\n\nEat on turn 4.\n\nThen from (2,5) to (5,2): Manhattan distance |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nBut since snake moves one per turn, from turn 4 position (2,5), to (5,2) in 6 moves: arrive on turn 10.\n\nTurn 4: at (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: move to e.g. (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: (5,2) — but food gone on turn 10.\n\nIf I can go directly, but no diagonal, so min 6 moves from (2,5) to (5,2), arriving turn 10, too late.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (5,2) is Δx=3, Δy=3, so min 6 steps since no diagonal.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I could go to (5,2) faster from other paths.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) on turn 3, if I move R to (4,6), then I can go down directly.\n\nFrom (4,6), move D to (4,5) on turn 4, then D to (4,4) turn 5, D to (4,3) turn 6, D to (4,2) turn 7.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (5,2) is one move right on turn 8.\n\nSo eat on turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, if I go via other ways.\n\nFrom (4,6) turn 3, move R to (5,6) turn 4, then D to (5,5) turn 5, D to (5,4) turn 6, D to (5,3) turn 7, D to (5,2) turn 8.\n\nEat on turn 8.\n\nBoth ways, I can eat by turn 8.\n\nIf I move L first, I eat (2,5) on turn 4, but then I can't reach (5,2) in time, since from (2,5) to (5,2) takes 6 moves, turn 10.\n\nBut (2,5) is eaten, so only one food to consider.\n\nFood at (2,5) and (5,2) both available.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) on turn 4, I get +1, but then I miss (5,2) because I can't reach it in time.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) and go for (5,2), I can eat (5,2) by turn 8, and (2,5) might still be there to eat later.\n\n(2,5) life span 7 at turn 3, so until turn 9.\n\nIf I eat (5,2) on turn 8, then I can go to (2,5) if possible.\n\nFrom position after eating (5,2), say on turn 8 at (5,2), then to (2,5), |2-5| + |5-2| =3+3=6 moves, turn 8 to turn 14, but food gone on turn 10, so impossible.\n\nTurn 8 eat (5,2), then on turn 9 I can move, but (2,5) disappears on turn 10, so I need to be at (2,5) on turn 9 or 10, but turn 10 it disappears, so must eat on turn 9 at latest.\n\nOn turn 8, I'm at (5,2) after eating, so positions changed.\n\nBut to reach (2,5) by turn 9: from (5,2) on turn 8, to (2,5) in one move? Impossible, min 6 moves, so can't reach by turn 9.\n\nTherefore, I can only eat one of the foods, not both, because they are on opposite sides.\n\nNow, (2,5) is closer to current position.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (2,5): I can go L to (2,6) then D to (2,5), 2 moves, eat on turn 4.\n\nTo (5,2): min moves, e.g., R to (4,6), D to (4,5), D to (4,4), D to (4,3), D to (4,2), R to (5,2) — that's 5 moves from turn 3: turn 3 R to (4,6), turn 4 D to (4,5), turn 5 D to (4,4), turn 6 D to (4,3), turn 7 D to (4,2), turn 8 R to (5,2) eat.\n\nOr shorter? From (3,6) move R to (4,6) turn 3, then R to (5,6) turn 4, then D to (5,5) turn 5, D to (5,4) turn 6, D to (5,3) turn 7, D to (5,2) turn 8. Same 5 moves to reach (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 3 to turn 8 is 5 moves: turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAfter action on turn, position changes.\n\nTurn 3: start at (3,6), after action move to new position for turn 4.\n\nEat on turn when head moves to food cell.\n\nFor (2,5): if I move L on turn 3 to (2,6), then on turn 4 move D to (2,5), eat on turn 4.\n\nFor (5,2): eat on turn 8 at earliest.\n\nNow, (2,5) can be eaten on turn 4, but then (5,2) cannot be eaten.\n\nIf I go for (5,2) first, I can eat on turn 8, but (2,5) disappears on turn 10, but to eat (2,5) after turn 8, from (5,2) to (2,5) takes min 6 moves, so arrive turn 14, impossible.\n\nTherefore, I can only eat one food, so I should choose which one to eat.\n\nBut both are +1, same value.\n\nBut I need to consider survival and risks.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) on turn 4, I grow to length 4, and I'm near the top-left corner.\n\nThen I need to navigate without dying.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (5,2), I eat on turn 8, grow to length 4 then? When I eat, I grow.\n\nCurrently length 3, if I eat (5,2) on turn 8, I grow to 4.\n\nBut from turn 3 to turn 8, I don't eat, so snake remains length 3.\n\nDuring that time, I might have risks.\n\nBut in this path, moving to (4,6), then down to (4,5), etc., seems safe, no immediate dangers.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not in the way.\n\nNow, after eating (5,2), I'm at bottom-right, and no other food, so I can just survive.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (2,5), I'm at top-left.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat both.\n\nEarlier calculation shows I can't, because of distance and time.\n\nBut is there a way to eat (2,5) quickly and then go to (5,2) faster?\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 4, to (5,2) min 6 moves, arrive turn 10, food gone.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) immediately, but go directly to (5,2).\n\nFor example, from turn 3, move R to (4,6), then I can go down, but I pass by (2,5)? (2,5) is at left, not on the way.\n\nI could move in a way to approach both, but time is short.\n\nAnother idea: if I move L on turn 3 to (2,6), but on turn 4, instead of eating (2,5), I move elsewhere, then go to (5,2), but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) on turn 4, I can move R to (3,6), but (3,6) is body? After move to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nSo (3,6) is body, cannot move there.\n\nMove D to (2,5), but if I move D, I eat, which I might not want yet.\n\nOr move L to (1,6), then from there, I can go down, but to (5,2) it's farther.\n\nFrom (1,6) to (5,2) is Δx=4, Δy=4, min 8 moves, from turn 4, arrive turn 12, food gone turn 10, impossible.\n\nSo if I go left, I can only eat (2,5) but not (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I go right, I can eat (5,2) but not (2,5).\n\nSo I have to choose one.\n\nNow, which one is better?\n\nEating (2,5) on turn 4: I get the food earlier, grow earlier, but might be in corner.\n\nEating (5,2) on turn 8: I get food later, but the path might be safer or something.\n\nAlso, need to consider the tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might affect movement in bottom row, but since I'm going to (5,2), not near (3,1), (5,2) is safe.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, not near bottom.\n\nNow, let's think about survival.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) on turn 4, snake at [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] for example.\n\nThen from there, I can move down to (2,4), then to (2,3), etc., down to bottom, but with obstacle at (3,1), so at y=1, I can go to (2,1), (1,1), (4,1) etc., but (3,1) blocked.\n\nBut the grid is 6x6 free, so plenty of space to move.\n\nSimilarly for the other food.\n\nBut since I can only eat one, and both same value, I should choose the one that allows better survival or less risk.\n\nBut with length 4, it's still small, so not much risk.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (2,5) because of the tail reward danger potential, but not now.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n\nBut currently, no food under tail, and not adjacent.\n\nIn this case, when I eat (2,5), tail is at (3,5), head at (2,5), not adjacent; they are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (2,5) and (3,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nPositions: after moving to (2,5), head at (2,5), tail at (3,5), which are adjacent? (2,5) and (3,5) are adjacent, yes, since |dx|=1, dy=0.\n\nAnd the tail cell (3,5) has food? No, food is at (2,5), which is where head is, not under tail.\n\nThe food is under head when eaten, not under tail.\n\nThe danger is if the tail cell has food and head is adjacent, then if I eat that food, but I eat by moving head to food cell, so if tail cell has food, and head moves to it, that means head moves to tail cell.\n\nBut when head moves to tail cell, if no food, it's safe because tail moves away.\n\nIf there is food on tail cell, and head moves to it, then I eat the food, so snake grows, and since head moves to tail cell, and food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new head and the old tail are on the same cell, which causes collision because the body segment is still there.\n\nRule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this scenario: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, then if I move head to tail cell, I eat the food, but since head moves to tail cell, and food eaten, the tail segment remains (because growth), so the head is on the cell where tail was, but tail is still there, so collision.\n\nMoreover, after growth, the new tail is added, but the position is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to tail cell with food: head and tail were adjacent, head moves to tail position, eats food, so new head at that position, and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the cell is occupied by both head and tail at that moment, collision.\n\nYes, so deadly.\n\nBut in this case, for (2,5), when I move to it, tail is at (3,5), which is adjacent, but the food is at (2,5), not at (3,5), so tail cell (3,5) does not have food, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,2), no issue.\n\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\nTherefore, both are safe to eat, but I can only eat one due to distance.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,5) and forget about (5,2), or vice versa.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating one is +1, same.\n\nBut long-term, after eating, I can survive to eat more food, but no more food is given, so only these two.\n\nThe state has only these two foods, and no more will spawn, I assume? The problem doesn't say food spawns, only these are given.\n\nSo only two foods, both +1.\n\nSince I can eat only one, it doesn't matter which, for score.\n\nBut for survival, I need to avoid dying.\n\nNow, if I eat (2,5), I'm in top-left, which might be riskier if I get trapped, but with length 4 and 6x6 grid, I can move around.\n\nSimilarly for bottom-right.\n\nBut there's an internal obstacle at (3,1), which might make bottom row a bit constrained, but not seriously.\n\nFor example, at y=1, cells (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are free, since (3,1) blocked.\n\nSo I can still move.\n\nSimilarly, top is open.\n\nPerhaps going for (2,5) is faster, I get the food on turn 4, then I can focus on survival.\n\nIf I go for (5,2), I eat on turn 8, so between turn 3 and 8, I don't grow, but snake is short, no problem.\n\nBut let's see the answer format: I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state is at turn 3, and I need to output from turn 3 onwards for several turns, but how many? The box says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to plan.\n\nThe instruction: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows actions for turns, but not how many.\n\nProbably I need to output the sequence for the immediate actions, perhaps until I eat food or something.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan the path to eat one food.\n\nSince both choices are similar, I should choose one.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to eat both? Earlier I thought not, but perhaps with different path.\n\nFor example, from turn 3, move D, but D is reverse and body collision, invalid.\n\nOnly L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), then on turn 4, instead of moving D to (2,5), I move L to (1,6), then I can move down to (1,5), but (2,5) is there, but if I move to (1,5), not eating (2,5) yet.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move to (2,5) if I want, but it's still turn 5 or later.\n\nTurn 4 at (1,6), move to (1,5) on turn 4 or turn 5? Turn 4 action.\n\nAfter turn 3 move L to (2,6), on turn 4 I can move from (2,6) to (1,6) L, or to (2,5) D, or to (2,4) but no, only adjacent.\n\nFrom (2,6), move L to (1,6), then positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6)? Before: head (2,6), B1 (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nAfter move L to (1,6): head (1,6), B1 to (2,6), tail to (3,6) — B1 was (3,6) moves to (2,6), tail moves to where B1 was (3,6).\n\nPositions: head (1,6), B1 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nThen on turn 5, from (1,6), can move D to (1,5), for example.\n\nThen at (1,5), and (2,5) is adjacent, so on turn 6, move R to (2,5) to eat.\n\nEat on turn 6.\n\nBut then (5,2) is even farther, impossible to reach by turn 9.\n\nIf I go directly down from left, but still slow.\n\nSo no, I can't eat both.\n\nTherefore, I must choose one food to eat.\n\nPerhaps eating (2,5) is better because I get the score earlier, and the snake is longer sooner, which might be better for survival if there were more food, but here no.\n\nBut survival: with longer snake, it might be harder to avoid collision, but here grid is large.\n\nLength 4 in 6x6 grid is fine.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (2,5) has life span 7, same as (5,2), both last until turn 9.\n\nBut since I can eat (2,5) on turn 4, it's available.\n\nIf I delay, it might be riskier.\n\nBut for (5,2), I eat later.\n\nBut let's consider the initial move.\n\nOn turn 3, I must move L or R.\n\nIf I move L, I can eat (2,5) soon.\n\nIf I move R, I go towards (5,2).\n\nBut to maximize score, since only one food possible, same score.\n\nBut perhaps I can survive longer without eating, but the goal is to maximize score, so eating food is good.\n\nIf I don't eat, score 0, but with eating, +1.\n\nSo I should eat one.\n\nNow, for the path to (5,2), when I move down, I might hit the obstacle or something, but not.\n\nLet's list a path to (5,2).\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,6), I can move D to (4,5) or R to (5,6)\n\nSay move D to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5), direction D, can move D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5), etc.\n\nSay move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: R to (5,2) eat.\n\nDuring this, on turn 4 at (4,5), etc., all cells should be free.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R first on turn 4 from (4,6), to (5,6), then turn 5 D to (5,5), turn 6 D to (5,4), turn 7 D to (5,3), turn 8 D to (5,2) eat.\n\nSame.\n\nNow, for (2,5), turn 3 L to (2,6), turn 4 D to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen after eating, I can explore.\n\nBut since no more food, I just need to survive.\n\nThe game might continue, but with no food, score doesn't increase, so I should just avoid dying.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify when the game ends, so I need to keep playing indefinitely, but with no food, score stays.\n\nBut to maximize score, since no more food, eating one gives +1, and then survive.\n\nBut in this case, both choices give +1, so equivalent.\n\nBut perhaps one path has less risk of collision.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,5), I might be near the wall.\n\nFrom (2,5) after eating, snake at [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nThen if I move D to (2,4), then I can go to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), then at (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) but (3,1) obstacle, so cannot, or U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body if I came from there.\n\nAfter moving to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), tail (3,6) as earlier.\n\nThen move D to (2,3): head (2,3), B1 (2,4), B2 (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nThen D to (2,2): head (2,2), B1 (2,3), B2 (2,4), tail (2,5)\n\nThen D to (2,1): head (2,1), B1 (2,2), B2 (2,3), tail (2,4)\n\nAt (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision; D to (2,0) wall invalid; L to (1,1) free; R to (3,1) obstacle invalid.\n\nSo only L to (1,1).\n\nMove L to (1,1): head (1,1), B1 (2,1), B2 (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nThen from (1,1), can move U to (1,2), L to (0,1) wall invalid, R to (2,1) body collision, D to (1,0) wall invalid.\n\nSo only U to (1,2).\n\nMove U to (1,2): head (1,2), B1 (1,1), B2 (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nThen U to (1,3), and so on.\n\nSo I can survive, but I'm confined to the left side, but I can move up and down.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,2), after eating, I might be in bottom-right, similar situation.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (3,1), the bottom row has a gap, but not a problem.\n\nNow, for the (5,2) path, when I go down, on turn 7 at (4,2) or (5,3), then to (5,2).\n\nAt (5,2), after eating, snake positions depend on how I arrive.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nPerhaps moving towards (5,2) is better because the internal obstacle is on the left, so the right side might be more open, but not really.\n\n(3,1) is on left bottom, but (2,5) is top-left, not affected.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nBut let's see the current turn and life span.\n\nTurn 3, food life span 7, so both available.\n\nSince eating (2,5) is faster, I should do that to get the score earlier, in case something happens later.\n\nThen I can focus on survival.\n\nWhereas for (5,2), I get the score later.\n\nBut score is the same, so no difference.\n\nPerhaps for thinking ahead, I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer format is to output actions for several turns, but not specified how many.\n\nProbably for the immediate actions, say 5 turns or so.\n\nBut I need to decide turn 3 action.\n\nLet's assume I go for (2,5).\n\nSo turn 3: move L to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 4: move D to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen after that, I need to move away.\n\nFor example, turn 5: from (2,5), direction D, move R to (3,5) or D to (2,4), etc.\n\nSay move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,5), can move U, D, R (no L, reverse if direction R).\n\nAfter turn 4 move D, direction D.\n\nTurn 5 move R to (3,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,5), direction R, can move U, D, R (no L).\n\nU to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5)\n\netc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, perhaps for 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 3 to turn 7 or something.\n\nSince the food at (5,2) is there, but I can't eat it, so ignore.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can eat (2,5) and then the snake is longer, but no benefit.\n\nI think I'll go for (2,5).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nThen for turn 5, I need to choose.\n\nBut in the output, I should list multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps list until I eat or for 5 turns.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 3, so up to turn 8.\n\nTurn 3,4,5,6,7,8: 6 turns? From t1 to t1+5.\n\nt1=3, so turns 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAfter turn 4, I ate food, so for turn 5 onwards, I need to survive.\n\nBut let's define a path.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5) on turn 4, positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] head at (2,5), direction D.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5)  -- but (3,5) is tail, so safe.\n\nAfter move, head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)? Positions: before turn 5: head (2,5), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove R to (3,5): head to (3,5), which was tail, so ok. B1 moves to (2,5), B2 moves to (2,6), tail moves to (3,6).\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5) (no L reverse).\n\nSay move D to (3,4)\n\nThen head to (3,4), B1 to (3,5), B2 to (2,5), tail to (2,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4), move D to (3,3), or L to (2,4), R to (4,4), etc.\n\nSay move D to (3,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (5,2).\n\nBut since I have to choose, and (2,5) is closer, I'll go with that.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nThen for turn 5, say R\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nBut I need to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps the first move is critical.\n\nAnother idea: if I move R on turn 3, I can still go to (2,5)? No, (2,5) is left, so not.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), to go to (2,5), it's farther.\n\n|4-2| + |6-5| =2+1=3 moves, from turn 4 position, arrive turn 7, but turn 7 is before turn 9, so possible, but then I can eat both?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf on turn 3 move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 4: from (4,6), move L? But L is left to (3,6), but (3,6) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nMove D to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5), move L to (3,5) or W to (4,4), etc.\n\nTo go to (2,5), from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), move L to (2,5)\n\nThen eat on turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5) move to (3,5) on turn 5, then to (2,5) on turn 6.\n\nEat (2,5) on turn 6.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,2)? From (2,5) on turn 6, to (5,2) min 6 moves, arrive turn 12, food gone turn 10, impossible.\n\nEat (2,5) on turn 6, but (5,2) cannot be eaten.\n\nIf on turn 4 from (4,6) I move R to (5,6), then down, eat (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nBut not both.\n\nSo still only one.\n\nTherefore, no benefit.\n\nSo I think for turn 3, move L to (2,6), then turn 4 move D to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, just move to survive.\n\nFor the output, I'll list a few turns.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: R ( to (3,5) )\n\nTurn 6: D ( to (3,4) )\n\nTurn 7: D ( to (3,3) )\n\nTurn 8: R ( to (4,3) ) for example.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSince the boxed answer should have the actions.\n\nI think that's fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 3):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1). Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6.\n- **Snake**: Head at (3,6), body at (3,5), tail at (3,4). Current direction: U (up). Length: 3.\n- **Food**:\n  - Positive food at (5,2) with value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - Positive food at (2,5) with value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 9).\n- **Constraints**: Cannot move opposite to current direction (U) immediately, so D (down) is invalid. U is invalid due to wall at (3,7). Only L (left) or R (right) are possible this turn.\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Food Access**: \n  - (2,5) is 2 moves away (L then D), can be eaten on turn 4.\n  - (5,2) is 5 moves away (e.g., R then down path), earliest eat on turn 8.\n  - Due to Manhattan distance and life spans (both disappear after turn 9), eating both is impossible. Only one food can be eaten.\n  - Eating (2,5) on turn 4 is faster, securing +1 score earlier and increasing length to 4. This allows more time to focus on long-term survival in a larger grid.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Moving to (2,5) has no tail reward danger (tail at (3,5) is adjacent but food is not under tail).\n  - After eating, the top-left area has space to maneuver; no immediate trapping risks with length 4.\n  - Path to (5,2) is safe but scores later, with no additional benefit.\n- **Survival Priority**: \n  - With no more food after these, the goal is to avoid collisions and walls. After eating, navigate to open areas (e.g., center or right side) to prevent dead ends.\n  - Internal obstacle at (3,1) slightly constrains the bottom row but doesn't block paths if avoided.\n\n**Chosen Path (Prioritize eating (2,5) for early score and simplicity):**\n- **Turn 3**: Move L to (2,6) – avoids walls/body, starts path to (2,5).\n- **Turn 4**: Move D to (2,5) – eats food, score +1, length increases to 4. New direction: D.\n- **Post-Eating Survival Moves (turns 5-8)**: \n  - Turn 5: Move R to (3,5) – safe move to tail cell (tail moves away). New direction: R.\n  - Turn 6: Move D to (3,4) – moves toward center, away from walls. New direction: D.\n  - Turn 7: Move D to (3,3) – continues to open area. New direction: D.\n  - Turn 8: Move R to (4,3) – shifts right for better mobility; avoids potential left-side constraints from obstacle at (3,1).\n\nThis sequence eats food quickly, maximizes score early, and ensures long-term survival by moving to less constrained areas. It avoids all collisions and walls, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 4: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 5: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 6: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 7: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 8: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n\n- Walls: Border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and one obstacle.\n\n- Snake Positions: Head at (2,6), then body at (3,6), and tail at (3,5). So the snake has 3 segments. Head direction is L, which means it's facing left.\n\n- Food:\n  - (5,2) with life span 6, value +1\n  - (2,5) with life span 6, value +1\n  - (5,4) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider that.\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n\n- I can move up (U), down (D), left (L), right (R), but since head is facing left (L), I cannot instantly reverse to right (R) on the next turn. So possible moves from (2,6) are: U, D, L. R is not allowed because it's opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so from (2,6), moving L would go to (1,6), U to (2,7), D to (2,5).\n\nBut I need to check for walls and collisions.\n\n**Walls:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So:\n\n- Moving L to (1,6): x=1 is not 0, so it should be ok, but (1,6) might be within bounds? x=0 is wall, so x=1 is not wall unless specified. Border walls are at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are free, except for obstacles.\n\nSimilarly for y: y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), which is not near current position.\n\nNow, snake positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5).\n\nIf I move, the body will follow. After moving, the tail moves away, so the cell that was tail might be free, but only if no food or something.\n\n**Food Mechanics:**\n\n- Food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nIn this state, let's see if any food is under snake.\n\nFood at (2,5), (5,2), (5,4). Snake is at (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). So (3,5) is tail, and food at (2,5) is adjacent but not under snake. (2,5) is a food position, and snake has tail at (3,5), so (2,5) is empty now, I think.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- (2,6): head\n\n- (3,6): body\n\n- (3,5): tail\n\nFood at (2,5), (5,2), (5,4). So (2,5) is not occupied by snake; it's a different cell. (2,5) is below head? Head at (2,6), so (2,5) is directly below.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,5), which is to the right of (2,5).\n\nNow, life spans: all food has life span starting from now? The state says \"life span\" with values 6,6,10 at turn t1=4. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after turn 4, life span decreases by 1? Let me read.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t1=4, food has life span L, meaning it will disappear after L more turns, including the current one? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nFor example, food at (5,2) with life span 6 at turn 4. That means after 6 turns, it disappears. So it will be gone after turn 9? Let's see:\n\n- At turn 4: life span 6\n\n- After turn 4 is executed, countdown decreases, so at start of turn 5, life span is 5.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 5, it becomes 4, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – this might be ambiguous.\n\nI think it means that at the beginning of turn t, the life span is S, then after the turn, S decreases by 1, so for the next turn, it's S-1.\n\nBut when the food is eaten or disappears.\n\nTypically, if not eaten, after S turns, it disappears.\n\nFor example, life span 6 at turn 4: it will disappear at the end of turn 9? Let's calculate.\n\n- Turn 4: life span 6\n\n- After turn 4, decreases to 5\n\n- After turn 5, to 4\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 9, decreases to 0, then disappears before turn 10? But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now.\n\nI think it's better to think: at turn t, life span S, it will disappear after S more turns, so it lasts from turn t to turn t+S-1, and disappears at turn t+S.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think \"including current\" means that during the current turn, the countdown includes it, so decreasing each turn.\n\nStandard way: at turn t, if food has life span N, it means it will be present for N more turns, including turn t, so it disappears at turn t+N.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, life span 6, so present on turns 4,5,6,7,8,9, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, life span 6 for (5,2) and (2,5), life span 10 for (5,4).\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for turns starting from turn 4.\n\nAnswer format is to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The box should have actions from turn 4 onwards.\n\n\"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" and so on, up to some point. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to output the actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nFirst, from current position (2,6), head direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (since R is reverse, not allowed).\n\nNow, check each move for immediate safety:\n\n- Move U to (2,7): y=7 is wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is wall, cannot move there. (2,7) is on the border, y=7, so wall, invalid.\n\n- Move D to (2,5): (2,5) is a food position? Food at (2,5) with value +1. But is it safe? Also, what about collision.\n\n(2,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5). (2,5) is not in snake positions, so it's free, except for food.\n\nAlso, walls: y=5 is not 0 or 7, so ok. No internal obstacle at (2,5).\n\nBut moving to (2,5): if I eat the food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added.\n\nSequence: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, grows, so tail stays, body extends.\n\nIn this case, if I move D to (2,5), which has food, I eat it, so snake becomes: new head at (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6) body, then (3,5) tail. So positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves, tail moves, so positions shift.\n\n- If food, head moves to food cell, eats it, so new head position, and tail does not move, so body segments: previous head becomes new body, etc., but tail stays.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't advance; a new segment is added at the head position.\n\nLet's clarify the mechanics.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Positive Food: Length of snake +1\" so when eaten, snake grows by one segment.\n\nMovement: each turn, head moves to adjacent cell, if it eats food, the tail does not move, so length increases by one. If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose current positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move to new cell N:\n\n- If N has food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  // tail T stays\n\n- If no food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ...] and T is removed, so the last body segment is new tail.\n\nIn this case, snake has three segments: let's index: position 0: head (2,6), position 1: body (3,6), position 2: tail (3,5).\n\nIf I move to (2,5) and eat food there, then new positions: head at (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6) body, then tail (3,5) remains? But (3,5) is tail, and since we ate, tail doesn't move, so positions become: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? But (3,5) is not adjacent to (3,6) in the new body; (3,6) to (3,5) is down, but in the list, it should be connected.\n\nAfter eating, the new segment is added at the head, so the body is: new head at food cell, then the entire previous snake body including tail remains, but shifted.\n\nPrevious: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nMove head to (2,5), which has food, so new snake: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]  // (3,5) is still there, and it's the tail.\n\nBut (3,5) is adjacent to (3,6)? (3,6) to (3,5) is down, yes.\n\nIf no food, move to (2,5), no food, then new positions: head (2,5), then body (2,6), then tail (3,6) — (3,5) is left, since tail moved.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) has food, so eating.\n\nBut (2,5) is food, so if I move D, I eat it.\n\nBut is there a danger? Tail at (3,5), and I'm moving to (2,5), which is adjacent to tail? (2,5) and (3,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut after eating, the tail will be at (3,5), and head at (2,5), so they are adjacent, but not colliding because it's not the same cell.\n\nCollision is when head touches any body segment, meaning same cell.\n\nHere, different cells.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,5), which has no food; the food is at (2,5), which is separate.\n\nThe rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n\nTail cell: the cell where the tail is located.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,5), and (3,5) does not have food; food is at (2,5), which is not the tail cell.\n\nSo this doesn't apply.\n\nTherefore, moving to (2,5) should be safe to eat.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions.\n\nAfter move D to (2,5):\n\n- Head moves to (2,5), eats food, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), then (2,6) (previous head), then (3,6) (previous body), then (3,5) (previous tail, now new body?).\n\nSince we ate, the tail doesn't move, so the segments are: new head at (2,5), then the previous head (2,6) is now body, then previous body (3,6) is still body, then previous tail (3,5) is still tail? No.\n\nWhen you eat, the snake grows by adding a new segment at the head position, but since head moves, it's like the tail remains fixed.\n\nStandard: positions after eating: the head is on the food cell, and the tail does not advance, so the previous tail is still there, and a new segment is added, but the new segment is the old head position.\n\nExample: before move: segments: S0=head, S1, S2=tail.\n\nMove head to new cell N.\n\nIf N has food: new segments: N (new head), S0 (new body), S1 (new body), S2 (new tail) — S2 is still tail.\n\nLength increased by one.\n\nIf no food: new segments: N (head), S0 (body), S1 (tail) — S2 is removed.\n\nIn this case, before move: S0=(2,6), S1=(3,6), S2=(3,5)\n\nMove to N=(2,5), which has food, so after: new head at (2,5), then S0=(2,6) as body, then S1=(3,6) as body, then S2=(3,5) as tail. So positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\n(3,5) is tail, (3,6) is body above it.\n\nNow, head at (2,5), which is adjacent to body at (2,6) and to tail at (3,5)? (2,5) to (2,6) is up, adjacent; to (3,5) is right, adjacent, but not same cell, so no collision.\n\nNext turn, when I move, the tail will move or not depending on eating.\n\nBut for now, it's safe.\n\nAlternative moves: move L to (1,6): (1,6) is not wall, not occupied, no food there, so move to (1,6), no eat, so new positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6) — (3,5) is left.\n\nThen head at (1,6).\n\nOr move U: but (2,7) is y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nMove D to (2,5) as above.\n\nMove R is not possible, reverse.\n\nSo only possible moves: D or L. U is invalid.\n\nD to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,5), which I can eat immediately by moving D.\n\nBut is it beneficial? Value +1, and it has life span 6, so it will be around for a while, but since it's close, I might eat it now.\n\nBut I should consider long-term.\n\nThere is also food at (5,2) and (5,4), which are farther.\n\n(5,4) has longer life span.\n\nNow, current head direction is L, but after move, direction changes.\n\nAfter moving, the new head direction will be based on the move.\n\nFor the next turn, I need to consider the new direction for the no-reverse rule.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 4: possible actions D or L.\n\nCase 1: Move D to (2,5), eat food.\n\nThen after turn 4: snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] with head at (2,5). Since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n\nFood at (2,5) is eaten, so removed. Other food still there, life spans decrease by 1 after turn? After turn 4, life spans decrease.\n\nAt start of turn 4, food life spans: (5,2):6, (2,5):6, (5,4):10\n\nAfter turn 4 is executed, if I eat (2,5), it is removed. Life span of others decrease to 5 and 9? Since countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAfter turn 4, for the remaining food, life span decreases by 1.\n\n(5,2) was 6, now 5; (5,4) was 10, now 9.\n\n(2,5) is eaten.\n\nThen turn 5: snake head at (2,5), direction D (since last move down).\n\nPossible moves: from (2,5), with direction D, so cannot move U (up, reverse).\n\nPossible: D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,4): y=4, not wall.\n\nL to (1,5)\n\nR to (3,5)\n\nNow, (3,5) is currently the tail, but after we ate, tail is at (3,5), but when we move, if no eat, tail moves.\n\nIn positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] head (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\nIf I move to (3,5), which is the tail cell, but in snake, moving to the tail cell is usually allowed because the tail will move away.\n\nBut here, (3,5) has no food, I assume.\n\nIf I move to (3,5), since it's the current tail, and I move there, head goes to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by tail, so collision? No.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to tail cell, and no food, then it's ok, because tail moves away, so head occupies that cell, and tail moves to next, so no collision.\n\nIf there is food on tail cell, but in this case, no food at (3,5).\n\nSo moving to (3,5) is possible.\n\nNow, from (2,5), moves:\n\n- D to (2,4): free, no food\n\n- L to (1,5): free, no food\n\n- R to (3,5): which is tail, but ok, and no food there.\n\nAlso, walls: all within bounds.\n\nIf I go to (3,5), since it's tail, and no food, head moves to (3,5), tail was at (3,5), but tail moves to where? When head moves to a cell, if no food, tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (2,5), body (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to new cell, say to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is currently occupied by tail, so head moves to (3,5), but since no food (assuming), then the tail moves: so new positions: head at (3,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (2,6) body, then (3,6) becomes tail? Let's see:\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,5), then the segments: since no eat, the last segment (tail) is removed, so the new body is [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) is the new tail? Positions: before move: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5) tail.\n\nMove head to N = (3,5).\n\nSince N is occupied by tail, and no food, it should be ok. New head at (3,5), then the body: (2,5) becomes new body segment, then (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6) becomes tail. The previous tail (3,5) is now head, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]? But (3,6) is tail, and (2,6) to (3,6) is right, but (2,6) is at (2,6), (3,6) at (3,6), adjacent.\n\nIn terms of collision, head at (3,5), which is different from body at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), all different cells, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut back to turn 4 decision.\n\nIf I move D on turn 4 to (2,5), eat food, grow to length 4.\n\nThen turn 5, I need to move from (2,5) dir D.\n\nNow, let's consider the other option: on turn 4, move L to (1,6).\n\nThen, no eat, so new positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6) — (3,5) left, since tail moved.\n\nHead direction now L (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 5, from (1,6), dir L, can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nU to (1,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5)\n\nL to (0,6): x=0 wall, invalid? x=0 is wall, so (0,6) invalid.\n\nSo only possible move D to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 5: move D to (1,5), no food there, so new positions: head (1,5), body (1,6), tail (2,6)\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut this seems less efficient, since I didn't eat the food at (2,5), which is nearby.\n\nMoreover, (2,5) has life span 6, but if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear or something, but I can eat it later.\n\nBut since it's close, eating it now might be good to grow.\n\nBut I need to think about the future food and risks.\n\nThere is also food at (2,5), which is very close, and (5,2), (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has longer life, 10 turns.\n\nBut let's map the grid.\n\nGrid is 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7), walls on borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), which is not relevant now.\n\nSnake at (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nFood at (2,5), (5,2), (5,4)\n\n(2,5) is directly below head, so moving D eats it.\n\n(5,2) is at bottom right, (5,4) is above it.\n\nNow, to reach (5,2) or (5,4), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut snake is at left side.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,5), I am at (2,5), with body around.\n\nNow, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, I should consider moving to eat (2,5) now, then plan from there.\n\nSince (2,5) has life span 6, it will be there until turn 9 (since turn 4 to 9, disappears turn 10), so I have time, but it's right there, so eating now is efficient.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) has life span 6, so until turn 9, (5,4) until turn 13.\n\nBut to reach (5,2) or (5,4), from (2,6), it's about 3-4 moves away, but with snake body, it might be tricky.\n\nFrom (2,6), to (5,2), delta x=3, delta y=4, so Manhattan distance 7, but with turns.\n\nBut I can plan a path.\n\nBut there might be risks with body.\n\nSince I have to think long-term, let's simulate both options.\n\nOption A: Turn 4, move D to (2,5), eat food.\n\nThen snake: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] head dir D.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5) dir D, possible moves: D, L, R (not U, reverse).\n\n- D to (2,4): free, no food\n\n- L to (1,5): free\n\n- R to (3,5): currently tail, but ok, no food\n\nNow, (3,5) is tail, but if I move to (3,5), since no food, head to (3,5), tail moves away, so new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nThen head at (3,5), dir R (since moved right from (2,5)? From (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so new dir R.\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,5) dir R, possible moves: U, D, R (not L, reverse).\n\nU to (3,6): but (3,6) is currently tail, but will move? At turn 5 end, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nIf turn 6 move U to (3,6), which is tail cell.\n\nIf no food, head to (3,6), tail moves, so new positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,6)? Let's see: before move, positions: 0:(3,5) head, 1:(2,5), 2:(2,6), 3:(3,6) tail\n\nMove head to (3,6), no food (assume), so new head (3,6), then body (3,5), then (2,5), then tail (2,6)? (2,5) to (2,6) is up, but (2,6) is at (2,6), (2,5) at (2,5), adjacent vertically? (2,5) to (2,6) is up, yes.\n\nBut (3,6) to (3,5) is down, adjacent.\n\nNo collision.\n\nThen head at (3,6), dir U.\n\nBut (3,6) is where the body was, but now head is there after move.\n\nFrom turn 5, if I move R to (3,5), then turn 6 I can go U to (3,6), but (3,6) is not food, so I just move.\n\nBut I need to get to other food.\n\nFood at (5,2) and (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is right and down from (3,6)? (3,6) to (5,4) is dx=2, dy=-2, so not direct.\n\nI could go directly towards food.\n\nFrom turn 4 after eating at (2,5), at (2,5) dir D.\n\nInstead of moving R to (3,5), I could move D to (2,4) or L to (1,5).\n\nLet's think about reaching (5,4) or (5,2).\n\n(5,4) is closer in y, but (5,2) is lower.\n\nLife span of (5,2) is shorter, 6 at turn 4, so after turn 4, 5 turns left, so by turn 9 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) has 10, so 9 turns left after turn 4.\n\nTurn 4: life span (5,2):6, so after turn 4, it has 5 turns left (at start of turn 5, life span 5, so present turns 5,6,7,8,9, gone at 10).\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): life span 10 at turn 4, after turn 4, 9, so present turns 5 to 13.\n\nTo reach (5,2) from current position (2,6), distance about 7 cells, but with body, I need to navigate.\n\nFrom (2,5) after eating, I can go right.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) dir D, move R to (3,5) on turn 5.\n\nThen at (3,5) dir R, turn 6 move R to (4,5)\n\nThen at (4,5) dir R, turn 7 move R to (5,5)\n\nThen at (5,5) dir R, but (5,5) is not food, then I can move down to (5,4) or (5,3) etc.\n\nBut food at (5,4) and (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move D to (5,4) to eat it, if it's still there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is below.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, turn 4: move D to (2,5), eat.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5) dir D, move R to (3,5)  // to go right\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,5) dir R, move R to (4,5)  // since can move R, not reverse\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,5) dir R, move R to (5,5)  // now at (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) dir R, possible moves: U, D, R (not L)\n\nU to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5)\n\nFood at (5,4), so move D to (5,4) to eat it.\n\nBut life span of (5,4) is long, so at turn 8, it should be there.\n\nTurn 4 life span 10, after turn 4:9, turn5:8, turn6:7, turn7:6, turn8:5, so yes, present.\n\nSo move D to (5,4) on turn 8, eat.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (5,2) instead, but (5,4) is closer from (5,5).\n\nBut what about the body? During this path, the snake is moving, and body might be behind.\n\nFor example, after turn 4: positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 5 move R to (3,5): now (3,5) was tail, but head moves to (3,5), no eat (since no food), so new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,6), tail (3,6)  // tail was (3,6)? Before move, tail was (3,5), but head moved to (3,5), and no eat, so tail moves: the last segment before move was (3,5), but it's occupied, so tail advances to (3,6)? Positions before turn 5 move: head (2,5), body (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)  // I think I have indices wrong.\n\nList positions in order: index 0: head (2,5), index 1: (2,6), index 2: (3,6), index 3: (3,5) tail\n\nMove head to (3,5). (3,5) is current position of tail.\n\nSince no food, head moves to (3,5), which is now head, then the new body segments: the previous head (2,5) becomes body, previous body (2,6) becomes body, previous body (3,6) becomes tail. The previous tail (3,5) is no longer part, since head took its place, but in terms of the list, new positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] with (3,6) as tail.\n\nYes.\n\nThen turn 6 move R to (4,5): (4,5) is free, no food, so head to (4,5), then new positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] with tail (2,6)\n\nThen turn 7 move R to (5,5): head to (5,5), no food, positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail (2,5)\n\nThen turn 8 move D to (5,4): (5,4) has food, so eat, grow. Positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), body (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5)  // since tail doesn't move.\n\nGrown to length 5.\n\nThis seems fine, and I ate two food.\n\nBut what about the food at (2,5)? I ate it on turn 4.\n\nAnd (5,2) is still there, but I didn't eat it, life span short.\n\n(5,2) at (5,2), from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), then (5,2), but (5,2) life span: at turn 4, life span 6, so after turn 4:5, turn5:4, turn6:3, turn7:2, turn8:1, turn9:0, gone? At start of turn 8, life span 1, so present on turn 8, after turn 8, decreases to 0, gone at turn 9.\n\nTurn 8 I am at (5,4) or moving to (5,4).\n\nAfter eating at (5,4) on turn 8, head at (5,4), I can move down to (5,3) on turn 9, then to (5,2) on turn 10, but (5,2) gone at turn 10? Disappears after life span, at turn 10 start.\n\nAt start of turn 10, if life span 0, gone.\n\nBut on turn 9, at start, life span of (5,2) is 1 (since after turn 8 it decreased to 1? Let's track.\n\nTurn 4 start: (5,2) life span 6\n\nAfter turn 4: decreases to 5 (for turn 5 start)\n\nAfter turn 5: to 4\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 8: to 1 (for turn 9 start)\n\nAfter turn 9: to 0, disappears before turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 9, (5,2) is still there with life span 1.\n\nIf I move to (5,2) on turn 9, I can eat it.\n\nBut from turn 8, after eating at (5,4), head at (5,4), dir D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4) dir D, can move D, L, R (not U).\n\nD to (5,3): no food? (5,3) not food.\n\nThen turn 10 move to (5,2), but on turn 10, (5,2) is gone, since disappeared after turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, at (5,4), I move D to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nThen on turn 10, move to (5,2), but (5,2) disappeared, so no food, just move.\n\nBut I missed eating (5,2).\n\nIf I go directly to (5,2) earlier.\n\nFor example, from the beginning, instead of going to (5,4), go to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is farther down.\n\nIn the path above, on turn 7 I am at (5,5), instead of moving D to (5,4) on turn 8, I could move D to (5,4) earlier? From (5,5) on turn 8, but turn 7 I am at (5,5), turn 8 move D to (5,4).\n\nBut from turn 6 at (4,5), on turn 7 move to (5,5), but (5,4) is below (5,5), so from (5,5) I can move D to (5,4).\n\nBut on turn 7, I moved to (5,5), not directly to (5,4).\n\nCould I have gone down earlier?\n\nBack to turn 4 decision.\n\nIf on turn 4 I move L to (1,6), then I might not eat (2,5) immediately.\n\nThen turn 5: only move D to (1,5), as U and L invalid.\n\nThen at (1,5) dir D.\n\nThen turn 6: from (1,5) dir D, can move D, L, R (not U).\n\nD to (1,4), L to (0,5) invalid (x=0 wall), R to (2,5)\n\n(2,5) has food, so move R to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen similar, but I ate later.\n\nBut I still eat (2,5) on turn 6, whereas in option A I ate on turn 4, so better to eat early to grow and have more flexibility.\n\nAlso, by eating early, snake is longer, which might be riskier, but in this small grid, with 4 or 5 segments, it might be ok.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (2,5) might be risky if the tail is adjacent, but in this case, tail was at (3,5), which is adjacent to (2,5), but (2,5) is not the tail cell; tail cell is (3,5), which has no food. So no danger.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle at (3,1), but it's far away, not an issue now.\n\nSo, for long-term, moving to eat (2,5) now seems good, then head towards other food.\n\nBut in the path I thought, I went to (5,4) via (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), then (5,4).\n\nBut from (2,5) after turn 4, I could go down first.\n\nFor example, turn 5 from (2,5) dir D, move D to (2,4)\n\nThen at (2,4) dir D.\n\nThen turn 6 move D to (2,3) or R to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut to go to (5,2), I need to go right.\n\n(2,3) is closer to (5,2) in y, but x is far.\n\nManhattan distance from (2,4) to (5,2) is |2-5| + |4-2| = 3+2=5, so 5 moves, but with body, it might take more turns.\n\nSince (5,2) life span short, I might not reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) on turn 5, to (5,2): need to go right and down.\n\nSay turn 6 move R to (3,4), turn 7 R to (4,4), turn 8 R to (5,4), but (5,4) is food, but I want (5,2), so turn 9 D to (5,3), turn 10 to (5,2), but (5,2) gone by turn 10.\n\nOn turn 8 at (5,4), if I eat it, then turn 9 to (5,3), turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nIf I don't eat (5,4) and go directly down, but from (4,4) on turn 8? Let's not complicate.\n\nSince (5,2) has shorter life, and I am far, it might be risky to try to get it, whereas (5,4) has longer life, easier to get.\n\nIn the first plan, I can get to (5,4) by turn 8 and eat it.\n\nThen (5,2) might be missed, but I ate two food already.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,2) from start.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,5) eat. // option A\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,5) dir D, instead of R, move D to (2,4)  // down\n\nThen turn 6: from (2,4) dir D, move D to (2,3)  // down\n\nThen turn 7: from (2,3) dir D, move D to (2,2)  // but y=2, ok\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,2) dir D, move R to (3,2) or something, but to go to (5,2), need right.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (5,2) is dx=3, so turn 8 move R to (3,2), turn 9 R to (4,2), turn 10 R to (5,2), but (5,2) gone at turn 10, so on turn 10 it's not there.\n\nOn turn 9 at (4,2), I can move R to (5,2) if it exists, but at turn 9 start, life span 1, so present, move to (5,2) on turn 9 to eat.\n\nBut from turn 7: at (2,2) dir D\n\nTurn 8: move R to (3,2)  // now dir R\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2) dir R, move R to (4,2) or directly to (5,2) if possible, but (5,2) from (4,2) is not adjacent directly? (4,2) to (5,2) is right, adjacent.\n\n(4,2) to (5,2) is east, yes.\n\nSo turn 9 move R to (5,2) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 9, (5,2) is present with life span 1.\n\nAfter turn 9, it decreases to 0, gone.\n\nSo eating on turn 9 is possible.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (2,5) on turn 4, then went down to (2,2), then right to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut I missed (5,4), which has longer life, but I can go back, but with longer snake.\n\nIn the first path, I ate (2,5) and (5,4), both.\n\nIn this second path, I ate (2,5) and (5,2), but (5,4) is still there for later.\n\nBut (5,4) life span longer, so I can eat it after.\n\nBut with the snake, after eating (5,2) on turn 9, I am at (5,2), then I can go up to (5,3), (5,4) to eat.\n\nBut (5,4) life span: after turn 4, 9 turns left, turn 9: at start, life span? Initial life span 10 at turn 4, after turn 4:9, turn5:8, ..., turn8:5, turn9:4, so still present, turn 10 move to (5,3), turn 11 to (5,4) eat.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut in terms of efficiency, the first path might be better because I eat (5,4) earlier and the path is shorter in moves to the second food.\n\nIn first path: turn 4 eat (2,5), turn 8 eat (5,4), 4 turns between.\n\nIn second path: turn 4 eat (2,5), turn 9 eat (5,2), 5 turns, and (5,4) eaten later.\n\nBut since both positive, similar.\n\nBut (5,2) has same value, but shorter life, so eating it before it disappears is good.\n\nIn both cases I can eat it, but in the first plan with going right, I don't eat (5,2), but I eat (5,4) which is better to eat since longer life or same.\n\nAll food +1, so value same.\n\nBut to maximize, eating both is good, but with the snake, I might have space issues.\n\nNow, back to the initial choice.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 4, if I don't eat (2,5) and move L, I might eat it later, but I lose the immediate opportunity, and it might disappear later, but life span 6, so I have time.\n\nFor example, if turn 4 move L to (1,6), then turn 5 move D to (1,5), then turn 6 move R to (2,5) to eat, so I eat on turn 6 instead of turn 4, so later, and snake shorter for two turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to eat now.\n\nTherefore, on turn 4, move D to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen for subsequent moves, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should have actions from turn 4 onwards for several turns.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, for the move from (2,5), I need to choose.\n\nIn the first plan, moving right towards (5,4).\n\nSo turn 5: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4) eat\n\nBut turn 8 is within 5 turns? Turn 4 to turn 8 is 4 steps, but turns: turn 4,5,6,7,8 is 5 actions? Turn t1=4, then t1+1=5, t1+2=6, t1+3=7, t1+4=8, so 5 turns.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, meaning plan for t1 to t1+4 or more.\n\nOutput actions for multiple turns.\n\nNow, after turn 8, I can continue, but perhaps for the answer, I can output up to turn 8 or so.\n\nBut let's confirm if this path is safe.\n\nAlso, on turn 5, moving R to (3,5): (3,5) is current tail, but as we said, it's ok.\n\nThen on turn 6, from (3,5) to (4,5): (4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free.\n\nThen (5,4) has food.\n\nBut when I move to (5,4) on turn 8, it should be fine.\n\nNow, what about the direction: after turn 4 move D, dir D.\n\nTurn 5 move R, so new dir R.\n\nTurn 6 move R, dir R.\n\nTurn 7 move R, dir R.\n\nTurn 8 move D, dir D.\n\nAll fine.\n\nNow, is there a risk of collision? For example, when moving, the body is behind, so as long as I don't loop, it should be ok.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (3,1), which is far, not in the way.\n\nAnother food at (2,5) I already ate.\n\nSo this seems a good plan.\n\nI could go to (5,2) directly, but as above, it takes longer and might not be necessary.\n\nSince (5,4) is on the way, better to eat it.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the state has only three food, all positive.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body: currently no food under snake.\n\nSo, I think move D on turn 4.\n\nThen the sequence: turn 4: D\n\nturn 5: R (to (3,5))\n\nturn 6: R (to (4,5))\n\nturn 7: R (to (5,5))\n\nturn 8: D (to (5,4) eat)\n\nBut turn 8 is t1+4, since t1=4, t1+4=8.\n\nThink 5 turns ahead might mean from current, plan for turns 4 to 9 or something.\n\nBut output actions starting from turn 4.\n\nI can output up to turn 8.\n\nBut since after turn 8, I can keep going, but for the answer, perhaps 5 actions: turn 4 to turn 8.\n\nt1 to t1+4 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but on turn 7, at (5,5), I move to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nBut (5,4) is food, so I eat.\n\nThen after, I can go to other places, but not necessary for now.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if I can include eating (5,2), but it might be tight.\n\nFor example, after turn 8 at (5,4) dir D, turn 9 move D to (5,3), then turn 10 to (5,2), but (5,2) gone, so not.\n\nBut (5,2) might not be reachable in time from here.\n\nFrom the beginning, if I head directly to (5,2), I can eat on turn 9 as in the second path.\n\nBut in that case, from turn 4: D to (2,5)\n\nturn 5: D to (2,4)\n\nturn 6: D to (2,3)\n\nturn 7: D to (2,2)\n\nturn 8: R to (3,2)\n\nturn 9: R to (4,2) or directly to (5,2)? From (4,2) to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut turn 9 action.\n\nIn this, for 5 turns: turn 4 D, turn 5 D, turn 6 D, turn 7 D, turn 8 R to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 9 R to (4,2), turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nOn turn 9, from (3,2) I can move to (4,2) or to (5,2)? Not directly, need to move to (4,2) first.\n\n(3,2) to (5,2) not adjacent, must move to (4,2) or (3,1) etc.\n\nSo turn 9 move R to (4,2), then (5,2) on turn 10 gone.\n\nUnless I can get to (5,2) by turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 7, instead of moving to (2,2) on turn 7, on turn 6 at (2,3), I could move R earlier.\n\nTurn 4: D to (2,5) eat\n\nturn 5: from (2,5) dir D, move R to (3,5)  // not down\n\nBut if I go down later.\n\nTo reach (5,2) faster, from (2,5), move D to (2,4) turn 5, then turn 6 move R to (3,4), turn 7 move R to (4,4), turn 8 move R to (5,4), but (5,4) is there, then I can move D to (5,3) turn 9, to (5,2) turn 10 gone.\n\nFrom (4,4) turn 8, move S to (4,3), turn 9 S to (4,2) or to (5,2)? (4,2) to (5,2) R.\n\nBut (4,4) to (5,2) not direct.\n\nShortest: from (2,4) turn 5, move R to (3,4) turn 6, then R to (4,4) turn 7, then D to (4,3) turn 8, then D to (4,2) turn 9, then R to (5,2) turn 10, gone.\n\nNot possible to eat (5,2) after turn 9 start.\n\nOnly if I am closer earlier.\n\nBut from start, at (2,6), if I go right immediately, but I have to eat (2,5) or not.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) and go right.\n\nFor example, turn 4 move L to (1,6), but then I have to go down to (1,5) turn 5, then to (2,5) turn 6 eat, then from (2,5) turn 6, to go to (5,2): similar to above, turn 7 D to (2,4), etc., but turn 7,8,9 to reach, turn 9 at (4,2) or something, not (5,2).\n\nWorse.\n\nSo it seems I cannot eat (5,2) before it disappears, because min distance is about 6 moves from turn 4, but with body, it might take 6-7 turns, and life span only 6, so from turn 4 to turn 9, 5 turns later turn 9, but to reach (5,2) from (2,6): dx=3, dy=4, min 7 moves, so at least 7 turns: turn 4 to turn 10, but turn 10 gone.\n\nWith optimal path, 7 moves: e.g., down, down, right, right, down, right, down or something.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (5,2): one path: D to (2,5), but if eat, stay or move; if not eat, move.\n\nBut to minimize time, don't eat and go directly, but (2,5) is on the way.\n\nIf I move to (2,5) and eat, I lose a turn? No, eating doesn't cost extra turn; I move and eat in one turn.\n\nBut after eating, I grow, which might slow me down in tight spaces, but here not.\n\nBut the position: from (2,6) to (5,2), after moving to (2,5) and eating, I am at (2,5), which is closer in y but same x.\n\nThen to (5,2), need to go to (3,5) or down to (2,4), etc.\n\nMin moves: from (2,5) to (5,2): |2-5|=3, |5-2|=3, so 6 moves.\n\nBut from turn 4: after move to (2,5), at turn 4 end.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5) to say (3,5), turn 6 to (4,5), turn 7 to (5,5), turn 8 to (5,4), turn 9 to (5,3), turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nOr from (2,5) turn 5 to (2,4), turn 6 to (2,3), turn 7 to (2,2), turn 8 to (3,2), turn 9 to (4,2), turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nCannot reach before turn 10.\n\nSince life span 6 at turn 4, it disappears at turn 10, so last chance to eat is turn 9.\n\nTo be on (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nI need to be adjacent to (5,2) on turn 8 and move to it on turn 9.\n\nBut from where I am, on turn 4, I am at (2,6), need to be at say (4,2) or (5,3) or (6,2) etc. on turn 8 to move to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\n(2,6) to (4,2) in 4 turns? |2-4|=2, |6-2|=4, min 6 moves, so turn 4 to turn 9 is 5 moves (turn5,6,7,8,9), 5 moves can cover distance 5, but here distance 6, not possible in 5 moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,3): |2-5|=3, |6-3|=3, distance 6, need 6 moves, turn 4 to turn 10, but turn 10 gone.\n\nThus, impossible to eat (5,2) before it disappears. It will disappear after turn 9, so cannot eat on or after turn 10.\n\nTherefore, I should not bother with (5,2) and focus on (5,4), which has longer life.\n\nEat (2,5) and (5,4).\n\nThus, the first plan is better.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 4: D (to (2,5) eat)\n\nTurn 5: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 6: R (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 7: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 8: D (to (5,4) eat)\n\nFor turn 9, I can add, but not necessary for answer, but since think ahead, I can output.\n\nFor example, after turn 8 at (5,4) dir D, I can move to other places.\n\nBut for the box, I'll output these 5 actions.\n\nt1=4 to t1+4=8.\n\nNow, write in answer format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead (from turn 4 to turn 8). The strategy involves immediately eating the accessible positive food at (2,5) to grow the snake, then navigating towards the food at (5,4) with a longer life span (10 turns at turn 4), ensuring the path avoids walls, obstacles, and potential collisions. The food at (5,2) has a shorter life span (6 turns at turn 4) and is too far to reach before it disappears (after turn 9), so it is ignored.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 4)**:\n  - Snake head at (2,6), direction L (left).\n  - Snake length: 3 segments.\n  - Possible moves from (2,6): U (up), D (down), L (left). R (right) is invalid (instant reverse not allowed).\n  - U to (2,7) is invalid (y=7 is a wall).\n  - D to (2,5) is valid and eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 4).\n  - L to (1,6) is valid but misses immediate food opportunity.\n\n- **Why Eat (2,5) Now?**:\n  - (2,5) is adjacent to the head and can be eaten safely (no tail reward danger, as the tail cell (3,5) has no food).\n  - Eating now grows the snake, improving reach for future food. (2,5) has life span 6 (disappears after turn 9), but delaying risks missing it or increasing path complexity.\n\n- **Path to (5,4)**:\n  - (5,4) has life span 10 at turn 4 (present until turn 13), allowing time for navigation.\n  - From (2,5), the path to (5,4) is planned via (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) to avoid walls/obstacles and maintain safe distances from the body.\n  - At (5,5), moving down to (5,4) eats the food on turn 8.\n\n- **Collision and Risk Avoidance**:\n  - Moving to the tail cell (e.g., (3,5) on turn 5) is safe because the tail moves away after the move (no food on tail cell).\n  - Body segments are tracked to prevent self-collision; the planned path keeps the body trailing without loops.\n  - Internal obstacle at (3,1) is distant and irrelevant to this path.\n\n- **Why Not (5,2)?**:\n  - (5,2) has life span 6 at turn 4 (disappears after turn 9). Minimum distance from (2,6) to (5,2) is 7 moves (Manhattan distance), requiring at least 7 turns. With the snake starting at turn 4:\n    - Earliest arrival at (5,2) is turn 10 (e.g., via D, D, R, R, D, R, D), but (5,2) disappears after turn 9 (not present on turn 10). Thus, eating (5,2) is impossible, and attempting it wastes turns.\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 4 to 8):\n- **Turn 4 (current)**: Move D (down) to (2,5) to eat the positive food. Snake grows to length 4, head now at (2,5) with direction D.\n- **Turn 5**: Move R (right) to (3,5). This is safe (tail cell, but tail moves away). Head at (3,5), direction R.\n- **Turn 6**: Move R (right) to (4,5). Free cell, no food. Head at (4,5), direction R.\n- **Turn 7**: Move R (right) to (5,5). Free cell, no food. Head at (5,5), direction R.\n- **Turn 8**: Move D (down) to (5,4) to eat the positive food. Snake grows to length 5, head at (5,4) with direction D.\n\n### Outcome by Turn 8:\n- Score increased by +2 (food eaten at turns 4 and 8).\n- Snake length: 5.\n- (5,2) has expired (life span 0 after turn 9, but not eaten).\n- Path ensures survival and positions the snake for future food opportunities (e.g., after turn 8, explore other areas as new food spawns).\n\nThis sequence is optimal: it secures two food items quickly, avoids all risks, and leverages the grid layout efficiently. Actions beyond turn 8 can adapt to new states but are not required for this response.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 5: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 6: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 7: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 8: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 5, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, I can't move into any cell where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, or (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,5), then body segments at (2,6), (3,6), and tail at (3,5). The head direction is down, which is D. Since the head is at (2,5) and direction is D, that means it was moving down to (2,5) from (2,6)? Let me list the positions:\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Body: (2,6) → this should be the segment behind the head. Since direction is D, moving down, so from (2,6) to (2,5) is down? Coordinates: (x,y). Down decreases y, I think. Let's confirm.\n\nTypically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement says U: (x,y+1), so U increases y, meaning y is up. D: (x,y-1), so down decreases y. So, head at (2,5) with direction D means it came from (2,6) because moving down to (2,5) from (2,6) would be decreasing y from 6 to 5.\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\n- (2,5) is head\n\n- (2,6) is next, so the neck\n\n- Then (3,6)\n\n- Then (3,5) tail\n\nDirection is D, down. So from turn 4 to turn 5, head moved to (2,5) from previous head position. Previous head was likely at (2,6) or something. Since positions are given in order, head first, so at turn 5, snake is at these positions.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (5,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,4) with life span 9, value 1 (also positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (5,2), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (5,2), life span 5 at turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 5 + (5 - 1) or something? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it exists for N turns starting from now.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn 5, life span 5, so:\n\n- Turn 5: countdown 5\n\n- Turn 6: countdown 4\n\n- Turn 7: countdown 3\n\n- Turn 8: countdown 2\n\n- Turn 9: countdown 1\n\n- Turn 10: disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,4) life span 9 at turn 5:\n\n- Turn 5: 9\n\n- Turn 6: 8\n\n- ...\n\n- Disappears after turn 13 (since 5+9-1=13? Wait no.\n\nAfter N turns: if it appears at turn t with life span N, it is available from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears on turn t + N.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – let's read carefully.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is N, then turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., when countdown reaches 0, it disappears, so after the turn where countdown is 1, on the next turn it's gone.\n\nStandard way: if countdown decreases each turn including current, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\nSo at turn t with life span N:\n\n- Turn t: countdown = N\n\n- Turn t+1: countdown = N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + k: countdown = N - k\n\nIt disappears when countdown reaches 0, so at turn t + N, countdown = 0, so it disappears before turn t + N + 1 or after turn t + N?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: the food is present for exactly N turns.\n\nFor example, life span N at turn t means:\n\n- Available on turns t, t+1, ..., t + N - 1\n\n- Disappears on turn t + N.\n\nYes, that makes sense with countdown decreasing.\n\nFor (5,2): life span 5 at turn 5, so available turns 5,6,7,8,9; disappears on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): life span 9 at turn 5, available turns 5 to 13, disappears on turn 14.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves starting from turn 5.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,5)\n\nDirection: D (down)\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move up immediately. Also, cannot move into walls or body, except tail might be ok if it moves.\n\nMovement constraints: I can choose U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since current direction is D, I cannot move U.\n\nAlso, collisions: if head touches body segment, it dies, but touching tail is ok if the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe.\n\nNow, let's list the current snake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,6)\n\n- Tail: (3,5)\n\nThe tail is at (3,5), which is adjacent to head.\n\nNow, food: (5,2) and (5,4), both positive.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are free, except internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is an obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's see what moves are possible from (2,5) with direction D.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U: (x,y+1) = (2,6) but (2,6) is currently occupied by the body segment. Is it safe? (2,6) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,5). So moving to (2,6) would collide with body, since (2,6) is a body segment and will not move away immediately; only the tail cell might be safe if moving into it.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves first, then the body follows.\n\nSo if I move to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's collision, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nHere, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). So moving to (2,6) would cause head to hit the body segment, so death.\n\nTherefore, cannot move U to (2,6).\n\n- D: (x,y-1) = (2,4). Is (2,4) free? Let's see current occupied: snake at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). (2,4) is not occupied, and not wall? Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 borders. (2,4): x=2, y=4, within 1-6? x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 are free except obstacles. (2,4) should be free, no obstacle mentioned except (3,1), so (2,4) is free. So moving D to (2,4) is possible.\n\n- L: (x-1,y) = (1,5). (1,5): x=1, y=5, not border wall, and not internal obstacle, so should be free. Snake not there, so possible.\n\n- R: (x+1,y) = (3,5). (3,5) is currently the tail. Since it's the tail, and if I move there, the tail will move forward, so it might be safe. Let's see: after head moves to (3,5), the tail was at (3,5), but since head moved to it, the tail will move to where? The body follows: when head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to (3,5), which is currently tail position. But the tail will move to the previous position of the next segment, but since it's the tail, it moves away.\n\nPositions: before move: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), tail (3,5).\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5):\n\n- New head: (3,5)\n\n- Then the body: first segment moves to where head was, (2,5)? No.\n\nThe body segments follow: the segment that was behind head moves to head's previous position.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the neck moves to where head was, and so on, down to the tail.\n\nSo, if head moves from (2,5) to (3,5), then:\n\n- New head: (3,5)\n\n- The segment that was at (2,6) moves to (2,5) (previous head position)\n\n- The segment that was at (3,6) moves to (2,6)\n\n- The tail that was at (3,5) moves to (3,6)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: tail (3,5)\n\nAfter head moves to (3,5):\n\n- New head: (3,5)  // this was the old tail position\n\n- Segment 1 (was at (2,6)) moves to old head position (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2 (was at (3,6)) moves to position of segment 1, which is (2,6)\n\n- Tail (was at (3,5)) moves to position of segment 2, which is (3,6)\n\nSo the cell (3,5) is now occupied by the new head, and the old tail moved to (3,6), so no collision because the tail vacated (3,5) just as head moved in.\n\nYes, so moving to the tail position is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,5), it should be ok.\n\nNow, (3,5) is within bounds, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- D: to (2,4) - free\n\n- L: to (1,5) - free\n\n- R: to (3,5) - tail, safe\n\nU: to (2,6) - body segment, not tail, so collision, not safe.\n\nAlso, cannot move U because opposite direction? Current direction is D, moving U would be reverse, which is not allowed, but even if it were allowed, it's occupied.\n\nSo impossible to move U.\n\nTherefore, possible actions: D, L, or R.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (5,2) and (5,4).\n\n(5,2) has shorter life span, only available until turn 9, while (5,4) until turn 13.\n\nBut I need to get to them.\n\nAlso, the grid has an obstacle at (3,1), which might affect paths.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, walls outside.\n\nObstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), tail (3,5). So it's a sort of square shape.\n\nFood: (5,2) and (5,4), both at x=5, y=2 and y=4.\n\nx=5, y=4 is closer in terms of x, but y is different.\n\nDistance: from (2,5) to (5,2): Δx=3, Δy=3, so Manhattan distance 6.\n\nTo (5,4): Δx=3, Δy=1, distance 4.\n\nBut with obstacles and snake body, need to find path.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, thinking 5 turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate move at turn 5.\n\nOptions: D, L, R.\n\nIf I move D to (2,4):\n\n- New head position (2,4)\n\n- Body: segment from (2,6) moves to (2,5), (3,6) moves to (2,6)? Previous positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nAfter head to (2,4):\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 1: moves to old head (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2: moves to old seg1 (2,6)\n\n- Tail: moves to old seg2 (3,6)\n\nSo new positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nHead direction was D, now moving D, so direction still D.\n\nIf I move L to (1,5):\n\n- Head to (1,5)\n\n- Body: seg1 to (2,5), seg2 to (2,6)? Old: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nAfter head to (1,5):\n\n- Head: (1,5)\n\n- Seg1: to (2,5)\n\n- Seg2: to (2,6)\n\n- Tail: to (3,6)  // since old seg2 was (3,6)\n\nOld positions: index 0: (2,5), 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5)\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head new: (1,5)\n\n- Seg1 new: to old head (2,5)\n\n- Seg2 new: to old seg1 position (2,6)\n\n- Tail new: to old seg2 position (3,6)\n\nSo positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nDirection: moved L, so new direction L.\n\nIf I move R to (3,5):\n\n- Head to (3,5)\n\n- Seg1 to old head (2,5)\n\n- Seg2 to old seg1 (2,6)\n\n- Tail to old seg2 (3,6)\n\nNew positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nDirection: moved R, so new direction R.\n\nNow, all three moves are possible immediately.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate which one is better for long-term, considering food and survival.\n\nFirst, food at (5,2) and (5,4). (5,4) is closer and has longer life, so perhaps prioritize (5,4) since it's easier to get to and I have time.\n\nBut (5,2) might disappear sooner, so if I can get it, good, but it might be risky.\n\nAlso, there is a danger about tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, currently, tail is at (3,5), and food is not on tail, so no issue yet.\n\nBut if food spawns under tail or something.\n\nCurrently, no food under snake, I think.\n\nFood positions: (5,2) and (5,4), not under snake.\n\nSnake is at (2,5),(2,6),(3,6),(3,5), all different.\n\nNow, let's think about paths to food.\n\nFirst, to (5,4): from current head (2,5), I can go right or down, etc.\n\nPossible paths:\n\nFor example, if I move R to (3,5), then from there, I can go to (4,5), then (5,5), then down to (5,4) or something.\n\n(5,4) is at y=4, so from (5,5) to (5,4) is down.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, obstacle at (3,1), which is below, but not directly in the way.\n\nAnother path: move D to (2,4), then to (2,3), (2,2), but (2,2) might be close to border, but y=2 is ok, then to (3,2), but (3,2) might be near obstacle? Obstacle at (3,1), so (3,2) is free, I think.\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, so (3,2) is free.\n\nThen from (3,2) to (4,2), (5,2) to get the food at (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2.\n\n(5,4) is at y=4.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, I should outline a sequence.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,2) has only 5 turns left, including turn 5, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) has more time.\n\nBut turn 5 is current, I can eat on turn 5 if I am on food, but I am at (2,5), not on food.\n\nSo I need to move towards food.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (5,4) first since it's closer.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving R to (3,5) gets me closer to x=5.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5), then to (5,5), then D to (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,5) to (5,4) is down.\n\nNow, is (4,5) free? Currently, snake is at (2,5),(2,6),(3,6),(3,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) should be free.\n\nThen (5,4) is food.\n\nBut when I move to (5,4), I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see how many turns.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,5), move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), move D to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nBut on turn 8, I eat (5,4), and snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nBut (5,4) has life span until turn 13, so turn 8 is fine.\n\nNow, what about (5,2)? It disappears after turn 9, so I need to eat by turn 9.\n\nFrom above, on turn 8 I am at (5,4), then I can go down to (5,3) or left/right, but to get to (5,2), I need to go to (5,3) then (5,2).\n\nBut on turn 8 after eating (5,4), positions: let's simulate.\n\nStart from turn 5 move.\n\nAssume I move R at turn 5 to (3,5)\n\nPositions after turn 5: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] as before.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nPossible moves: from (3,5), direction R, so can move U, D, L, R, but not opposite, opposite of R is L, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is currently occupied? After turn 5, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\n(3,6) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so moving to (3,6) would collide.\n\nD to (3,4) - free? (3,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\nR to (4,5) - free.\n\nL to (2,5) - but (2,5) is occupied by body, and cannot move L because opposite direction? Direction is R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U, D, R, but U to (3,6) is occupied, so not safe. Only D or R.\n\nD to (3,4) or R to (4,5).\n\nI want to go to (4,5), so move R.\n\nSo turn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nNew positions: head to (4,5), then seg1 to old head (3,5), seg2 to old seg1 (2,5)? Old positions after turn 5: head (3,5), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nAfter head to (4,5):\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Seg1: to (3,5)\n\n- Seg2: to (2,5)  // old seg1 position\n\n- Tail: to (2,6)  // old seg2 position\n\nNew positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nTail at (2,6).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nPossible moves: direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nU to (4,6) - free? (4,6) not occupied.\n\nD to (4,4) - free.\n\nR to (5,5) - free.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nAll seem free, so move R to (5,5).\n\nNew positions: head to (5,5), seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (3,5), tail to (2,5)? Old: head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Seg1: to (4,5)\n\n- Seg2: to (3,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Tail: to (2,5)  // old seg2\n\nBut old seg2 was (2,5), which is now occupied? New tail to (2,5), but (2,5) was old seg2 position.\n\nPositions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]  // tail at (2,5)\n\n(2,6) is no longer part of snake, since tail moved to (2,5).\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), I want to move D to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nDirection: after moving R to (5,5), direction is R.\n\nCan move D? Yes, not opposite.\n\nD to (5,4) is the food.\n\nIs it free? Currently, no one at (5,4), so yes.\n\nMove D to (5,4).\n\nEat food, so snake grows, tail doesn't move.\n\nAfter move: head to (5,4), then since eat, new segment added, so positions: head (5,4), then the body: seg1 to old head (5,5), seg2 to old seg1 (4,5), seg3 to old seg2 (3,5), and tail remains old tail, but since ate, a new segment is added at the tail position before move? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, length increases.\n\nSo before move: positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 4.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,4) and eat:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- New segment added at the end, so the body moves: seg1 to old head (5,5), seg2 to old seg1 (4,5), seg3 to old seg2 (3,5), and new segment at old tail position (2,5)? Let's see.\n\nThe snake grows by not moving the tail, so the tail segment stays.\n\nPositions: new head at (5,4), then the previous head becomes the neck, so:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Seg1: (5,5)  // previous head\n\n- Seg2: (4,5)  // previous seg1\n\n- Seg3: (3,5)  // previous seg2\n\n- Tail: (2,5)  // previous tail, but since ate, it stays, so now tail is (2,5), and new segment? The length increases, so there is an additional segment.\n\nTypically: after eating, the head moves to food, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is effectively added at the tail position.\n\nSo positions become: [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] so length 5.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I ate (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nBut (5,2) is still there, available until turn 9.\n\nOn turn 8, I am at (5,4), and (5,2) is at (5,2), so I can move down to (5,3) on turn 8 after eating? Turn 8 move: I moved to (5,4) and ate, so positions now head at (5,4).\n\nDirection: moved D to (5,4), so direction now D.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), I can move D to (5,3) to go towards (5,2).\n\n(5,3) should be free, not occupied.\n\nMove D to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (5,2) to eat, but (5,2) disappears on turn 10? Life span: available until turn 9, disappears on turn 10.\n\nTurn 9: countdown for (5,2) is 1 (since turn 5:5,6:4,7:3,8:2,9:1,10:0 disappear).\n\nSo on turn 9, it is still available, countdown=1.\n\nI can eat on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, I move to (5,3), but (5,3) is not food, food is at (5,2).\n\nOn turn 8, after eating (5,4), I am at (5,4).\n\nTurn 9: I move to (5,3) or directly to (5,2)? From (5,4) to (5,2) is two steps, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nSo turn 9: move to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10: move to (5,2), but on turn 10, (5,2) is gone, disappeared.\n\nSo I cannot eat it on turn 10.\n\nI need to eat on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 9, I am at (5,4), I can move directly to (5,3) or to (5,2) if possible, but (5,2) is at distance, I need to move down twice.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving D to (5,3) or U to (5,5), etc., but not directly to (5,2).\n\nSo to reach (5,2) from (5,4) takes two moves: first to (5,3), then to (5,2).\n\nBut on turn 9, I can be at (5,3), not at (5,2).\n\nOn turn 10, (5,2) is gone.\n\nTherefore, with this path, I miss (5,2).\n\nIf I want to eat both, I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps go for (5,2) first since it has shorter life.\n\nBut (5,2) is farther and might be riskier.\n\nAnother option: from current position, move D to (2,4), then go down to (2,3), (2,2), then to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) to eat (5,2) sooner.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,4)\n\nAs earlier, positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 6: from (2,4), can move D to (2,3), or L to (1,4), or R to (3,4), but direction D, so cannot move U.\n\n(3,4) might be free.\n\nTo go to (5,2), best to go down.\n\nMove D to (2,3)\n\nNew positions: head to (2,3), seg1 to (2,4), seg2 to (2,5), tail to (2,6)? Old: head (2,4), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nAfter move to (2,3):\n\n- Head: (2,3)\n\n- Seg1: (2,4)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (2,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Tail: (2,6)  // old seg2\n\nOld tail (3,6) is gone? Positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)] tail at (2,6)\n\nBut (3,6) is vacated.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), move D to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) is free? y=2, not border, not obstacle.\n\nMove D to (2,2)\n\nPositions: head (2,2), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (2,4), tail (2,5)? Old: head (2,3), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nAfter move: head (2,2), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (2,4), tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2), now I need to go right to (3,2), etc.\n\nMove R to (3,2)\n\nDirection was D, moving R is not opposite, so ok.\n\n(3,2) is free? Obstacle at (3,1), but (3,2) is different, so free.\n\nMove R to (3,2)\n\nPositions: head (3,2), seg1 (2,2), seg2 (2,3), tail (2,4)? Old: head (2,2), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (2,4), tail (2,5)\n\nAfter move: head (3,2), seg1 (2,2), seg2 (2,3), tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2), move R to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) free.\n\nMove R to (4,2)\n\nPositions: head (4,2), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (2,2), tail (2,3)? Old: head (3,2), seg1 (2,2), seg2 (2,3), tail (2,4)\n\nAfter: head (4,2), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 10: move R to (5,2) to eat, but (5,2) disappeared on turn 10? Turn 10 it is gone.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (4,2), not at (5,2).\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can move to (5,2) on turn 10, too late.\n\nIf I go faster.\n\nFrom turn 5, if I move directly towards (5,2).\n\nBut from (2,5), moving D to (2,4) is one step down, but (5,2) is also left/right.\n\nManhattan distance is |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6, so minimum 6 moves to reach, but from turn 5, I need to eat by turn 9, which is 4 moves later? Turn 5 to turn 9 is 4 moves? Let's count.\n\nTurn 5: start\n\nTurn 6: move 1\n\nTurn 7: move 2\n\nTurn 8: move 3\n\nTurn 9: move 4\n\nAfter 4 moves, on turn 9, I can be at a cell within Manhattan distance 4 from start, but (5,2) is distance 6 from (2,5), so impossible to reach in 4 moves.\n\nManhattan distance: from (2,5) to (5,2): Δx=3, Δy=3, min moves 6.\n\nTurns: turn 5 I am at (2,5), not moved yet for eating.\n\nTurn 5: I move, so after move, position changed.\n\nBut eating happens when I move to the food cell.\n\nSo to eat on turn t, I need to move to the food cell on that turn.\n\nSo for (5,2), I need to be on (5,2) on turn t for t <=9.\n\nEarliest possible: since distance 6, I need at least 6 moves to reach.\n\nFrom turn 5 position (2,5), after first move on turn 5, I can be at (1,5), (2,4), or (3,5), all at distance 5 or 4 from (5,2)? (1,5) to (5,2): Δx=4, Δy=3, dist 7\n\n(2,4) to (5,2): Δx=3, Δy=2, dist 5\n\n(3,5) to (5,2): Δx=2, Δy=3, dist 5\n\nAfter turn 5 move, min distance to (5,2) is 5.\n\nThen after turn 6 move, min distance 4, and so on.\n\nTo reach (5,2), it takes at least 5 moves from turn 5: turn 5 move to somewhere, turn 6,7,8,9: on turn 9, after 5 moves, I can be at (5,2) if I move directly.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) turn 5 move R to (3,5) dist to (5,2) is |5-3| + |2-5| =2+3=5\n\nTurn 6 move R to (4,5) dist to (5,2) |5-4| + |2-5| =1+3=4\n\nTurn 7 move R to (5,5) dist |5-5| + |2-5| =0+3=3\n\nTurn 8 move D to (5,4) dist to (5,2) |0| + |2-4| =2\n\nTurn 9 move D to (5,3) dist to (5,2) 1, then turn 10 to (5,2) but too late.\n\nTo reach (5,2) faster, I need to go down earlier.\n\nFrom (2,5) turn 5 move D to (2,4) dist to (5,2) |5-2| + |2-4| =3+2=5\n\nTurn 6 move D to (2,3) dist |3| + |1| =4? (2,3) to (5,2) Δx=3, Δy=1, dist 4\n\nTurn 7 move D to (2,2) dist |3| + |0| =3\n\nTurn 8 move R to (3,2) dist |2| + |0| =2? (3,2) to (5,2) Δx=2, Δy=0, dist 2\n\nTurn 9 move R to (4,2) dist 1\n\nTurn 10 move R to (5,2) too late.\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 8, I can move to (3,2) on turn 8, but to (5,2) is still two steps away.\n\nOr from (2,3) on turn 6, I can move R to (3,3) then down, but still.\n\nMinimum moves to (5,2) from (2,5) is 6, and with 4 moves from turn 5 to turn 9, I can only reduce distance by 4, from 6 to 2, not to 0.\n\nAfter turn 5 move, distance at best 5, then turn 6:4, turn 7:3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, so on turn 9 I am at distance 1, not at (5,2).\n\nThus, it is impossible to eat (5,2) by turn 9 from any starting move on turn 5, because the Manhattan distance is 6 and I only have 4 moves to cover it (turns 6,7,8,9 for moving, but turn 5 move is the first, so positions after turn 5,6,7,8,9: 5 moves, but after turn 5 move, distance 5, so after 5 moves, I can reach, but on turn 9, after the move, I can be at (5,2) if I move directly.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\n- Turn 5: I make a move from current position (2,5) to a new position.\n\n- Turn 6: move from that position to another, and so on.\n\n- To eat on turn t, I move to food on turn t.\n\nFor turn 9, I need to move to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nThat means after 4 moves (turns 5,6,7,8), I need to be at a cell adjacent to (5,2), so that on turn 9 I can move to it.\n\nAfter 4 moves, from (2,5), I can be at a cell within 4 moves.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), adjacent cells: (4,2), (6,2), (5,1), (5,3)\n\nBut (6,2) is x=6, y=2, x=6 is border? Walls: x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=6 is not wall, since x=1 to 6 are free, except obstacles. Obstacles only (3,1), so (6,2) free.\n\n(5,1) y=1, not wall.\n\n(5,3) free.\n\n(4,2) free.\n\nNow, from (2,5) to, say, (4,2) in 4 moves.\n\nFor example: turn 5: move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (3,2) — but (3,2) is not adjacent to (5,2), (3,2) to (5,2) dist 2.\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 8, I am at (2,2), which is dist 3 from (5,2), not adjacent.\n\nTo reach an adjacent cell in 4 moves.\n\nFor example, to (4,2): from (2,5) to (4,2), Δx=2, Δy=3, min moves 5, since |Δx| + |Δy| = 5.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,3): Δx=3, Δy=2, min 5 moves.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (5,3): |3| + |2| =5, yes.\n\nAfter 4 moves, the best I can be is at distance 1, like (4,2) or (5,3), but not at adjacent cell in 4 moves because min distance is 5, so after 4 moves, distance at least 1.\n\nFor example:\n\nPath to (5,3):\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5)  // dist to (5,3) |2| + |2| =4\n\n(3,5) to (5,3) Δx=2, Δy=2, dist 4\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)  // dist to (5,3) |1| + |2| =3\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)  // dist to (5,3) |1| + |1| =2\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4) etc.  // if to (4,3), dist to (5,3) is 1\n\nThen turn 9: move R to (5,3)  // but (5,3) is not the food, food is at (5,2)\n\n(5,3) is adjacent to (5,2), but I need to be at (5,2) to eat.\n\nTo eat (5,2), I need to move to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom above, on turn 8, I can be at (4,3) or (5,3), both dist 1 from (5,2).\n\n(4,3) to (5,2) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share a side, so (4,3) adjacent to (4,2),(4,4),(3,3),(5,3)\n\n(5,3) adjacent to (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3)\n\nSo from (5,3), I can move to (5,2) directly.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,2) or (5,1) or (6,2), etc.\n\nSo if on turn 8 I am at (5,3), then turn 9 I can move to (5,2) to eat.\n\nBut can I be at (5,3) on turn 8?\n\nFrom start:\n\nTurn 5: move from (2,5) to say (3,5)  // dist to (5,3) = |2| + |2| =4\n\nTurn 6: move to (4,5)  // dist to (5,3) = |1| + |2| =3\n\nTurn 7: move to (5,5)  // dist to (5,3) = |0| + |2| =2\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,4)  // dist to (5,3) = |0| + |1| =1, but (5,4) is food, if I move to (5,4) on turn 8, I eat it, but I want to go to (5,3).\n\nIf I move to (5,4) on turn 8, I eat (5,4), then on turn 9 I can move to (5,3), but (5,3) is not food, then turn 10 to (5,2) too late.\n\nTo reach (5,3) on turn 8, from (5,5) on turn 7, I can move D to (5,4) on turn 8, but that's (5,4), not (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, I can move D to (5,4) or U to (5,6) or L to (4,5) or R to (6,5), but not directly to (5,3).\n\nTo reach (5,3) on turn 8, I need to be at (5,4) or (4,3) or (5,2) or (6,3) on turn 7.\n\nBut (5,2) is the food, not where I am.\n\nFor example, on turn 7, if I am at (5,4), then turn 8 move D to (5,3).\n\nBut to be at (5,4) on turn 7.\n\nFrom (2,5) turn 5 move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6 move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7 move R to (5,5)  // at (5,5) on turn 7\n\nThen turn 8 move D to (5,4)  // at (5,4) on turn 8, not (5,3)\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8, I need to move down earlier.\n\nFor example, turn 5 move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7 move R to (3,3)  // for example\n\nAt (3,3) on turn 7, dist to (5,3) is 2, then turn 8 move R to (4,3), then turn 9 move R to (5,3), but that's turn 9 at (5,3), then turn 10 to (5,2) late.\n\nTurn 7 at (3,3), turn 8 move to (4,3), turn 9 to (5,3), not (5,2).\n\nI think it's impossible to reach (5,2) by turn 9 because the minimum number of moves from (2,5) to (5,2) is 6, and turn 5 to turn 9 is only 4 moves (turn 5,6,7,8 for moving to positions, but on turn 9 I move to the cell).\n\nThe moves are on turns 5,6,7,8,9 for reaching on turn 9.\n\n5 moves: turn 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nEach move changes position.\n\nStart at turn 5 before move: at (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 5 move: to a new cell, say P5\n\nAfter turn 6 move: to P6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9 move: to P9, where I eat if P9 is food.\n\nTo have P9 = (5,2), I need a path from (2,5) to (5,2) in 5 moves.\n\nSince Manhattan distance is 6, it is possible with no obstacles, but in this grid, there might be paths.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,3)  // at (5,3), not (5,2)\n\nTurn 9 at (5,3), dist 1 to (5,2).\n\nTo reach (5,2) on turn 9, I need to be there.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 8, I can move to (5,3) or (4,2), not directly to (5,2).\n\n(4,3) to (5,2) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, not allowed, only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can go to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,2).\n\nSo to be at (5,2) on turn 9, I need to move to it from an adjacent cell on turn 9.\n\nThe adjacent cells are (4,2), (6,2), (5,1), (5,3).\n\nSo I need to be at one of these on turn 8.\n\nFor example, be at (5,3) on turn 8, then turn 9 move D to (5,2).\n\nBut can I be at (5,3) on turn 8?\n\nFrom (2,5) in 3 moves? Turn 5 to turn 8 is 3 moves: turn 5,6,7 to reach position on turn 7, then turn 8 move to P8.\n\nAfter turn 7 move, I am at P7, then turn 8 move to P8.\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8, I move to it on turn 8 from P7.\n\nP7 must be adjacent to (5,3), so (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4).\n\n(5,2) is food, not likely P7.\n\n(5,4) is food.\n\n(4,3) or (6,3).\n\nSay P7 at (4,3), then turn 8 move R to (5,3).\n\nBut to be at (4,3) on turn 7.\n\nFrom (2,5) in 2 moves: turn 5 and turn 6.\n\nAfter turn 6, at P6.\n\nFor example, turn 5 move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (3,4)  // at (3,4) on turn 6\n\nThen turn 7 move R to (4,4) or D to (3,3), etc., not to (4,3) directly.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (4,3) not adjacent.\n\nTurn 5 move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 6 move R to (3,4)  // at (3,4) on turn 6\n\nSame as above.\n\nTurn 5 move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (3,4)  // at (3,4)\n\nTurn 7 move to (4,4) or (3,3) or (2,4) etc., not (4,3).\n\n(3,4) to (4,3) is not a direct move, only to (3,3), (3,5), (4,4), (2,4).\n\nSo I cannot reach (4,3) in one move from (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nThe fastest way to (5,3) is:\n\nTurn 5: to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: to (5,4)  // but that's eating if it's food\n\nOr to (5,3) directly from (5,4) not possible.\n\nFrom (4,5) turn 7 move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8 move R to (5,4) or D to (4,3), etc.\n\nNot to (5,3).\n\nSo it seems impossible to be at (5,3) on turn 8 or at any adjacent cell to (5,2) on turn 8 in a way that allows moving to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSince the minimum distance is 6, and 5 moves from turn 5 to turn 9, I can reach (5,2) on turn 9 only if I take a direct path with no detours.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5)  // dist 5 to (5,2)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)  // dist 4 to (5,2) |1| + |3| =4\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)  // dist to (5,2) |1| + |2| =3\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3)  // dist to (5,2) |1| + |1| =2\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,3)  // at (5,3), dist 1 to (5,2)\n\nOr turn 8 move R to (5,4) from (4,4), then turn 9 move D to (5,3), not to (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 8, I can move R to (5,3) on turn 9, not to (5,2).\n\nTo move to (5,2) on turn 9, I need to be at (4,2), (5,1), (6,2), or (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nBut from (4,3) on turn 8, I can go to (4,2) or (5,3), not directly to (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 8, I can move R to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,3) on turn 8, move D to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo can I be at (4,2) or (5,3) on turn 8?\n\nFor (4,2):\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (3,2)  // at (3,2), not (4,2)\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 7, move R to (3,2) on turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9 move R to (4,2), then turn 10 to (5,2) late.\n\nTo be at (4,2) on turn 8:\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (4,3) or something, not (4,2).\n\nTurn 7 at (3,3), move D to (3,2) on turn 8, then not (4,2).\n\nIt's not possible to reach (4,2) or (5,3) by turn 8 because the path requires more moves.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) to (4,2): min 5 moves, so after 3 moves (turns 5,6,7), I can be at (4,2) only if I move directly, but with Manhattan, it takes 5 moves, so after 3 moves, distance at least 2.\n\nAfter turn 7, at best at (4,4) or (3,3), etc., not at (4,2).\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (5,2) by turn 9. It will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSo I should not worry about (5,2) and focus on (5,4) and long-term survival.\n\n(5,4) has life span 9, so available until turn 13, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, there might be other food later, but for now, only these two.\n\nSo back to planning.\n\nAt turn 5, I can move D, L, or R.\n\nMoving R to (3,5) as I thought earlier to go to (5,4).\n\nBut let's consider risks.\n\nThe snake is currently in a position where moving L to (1,5) might be safe, but it's away from food.\n\nMoving D to (2,4) also.\n\nBut moving R to (3,5) is towards food.\n\nThere is a potential danger with the tail.\n\nCurrently, after moving R to (3,5), positions: head at (3,5), body at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nHead at (3,5), tail at (3,6), which are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf there were food on tail, it could be dangerous, but no food there.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating (5,4), the snake will be longer, and I need to avoid colliding.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), which might block paths in the lower part.\n\nBut for now, I can go to (5,4) as planned.\n\nBut earlier with moving R, I can eat (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nThen after that, I can explore other areas.\n\nPerhaps I can move D first to have more space.\n\nLet's list the possible actions at turn 5 and their implications.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (3,5)\n\nThen as before, I can go to (4,5) on turn 6, (5,5) on turn 7, (5,4) on turn 8 eating.\n\nAfter that, snake at [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] with head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen I can move, say, L to (4,4) or U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, not safe, or D to (5,3), etc.\n\nOption 2: Move D to (2,4)\n\nThen I can go down to (2,3), (2,2), then right to (3,2), etc., but no food there, and (5,2) is gone, so I need to go to (5,4) later, which takes longer.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) turn 5, then turn 6 to (2,3), turn 7 to (2,2), turn 8 to (3,2), turn 9 to (4,2), turn 10 to (5,2) but gone, then to (5,3), (5,4) to eat on turn 11 or later, which is fine since life span to turn 13.\n\nBut later eating means less time for other food, but no other food now.\n\nOption 3: Move L to (1,5)\n\nThen I am on the left, away from food.\n\nThen I need to go right later.\n\nBut the grid is small, so I might hit walls or myself.\n\nFor example, move L to (1,5), then I can go down or up or right.\n\nBut right back to (2,5), which might be occupied later.\n\nBut let's not choose this, as it's away from food.\n\nSo between R and D, R is better to reach food faster.\n\nMoving R also avoids the body.\n\nBut moving D to (2,4) might open more space.\n\nWith move R, I can eat on turn 8.\n\nAfter eating, the snake is longer, and I need to be careful.\n\nThe tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, no food on tail.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but only can be eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n\nBut for now, no such situation.\n\nAnother risk: after eating (5,4), the snake is at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nHead at (5,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5) but occupied, collision.\n\nD to (5,3) - free.\n\nL to (4,4) - free.\n\nR to (6,4) - x=6, not wall, free.\n\nCannot move U because occupied and opposite? Direction is D, U is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), then to (5,2) but gone, or to other cells.\n\nMove L to (4,4), then I can go to (4,3), etc.\n\nOr move R to (6,4), then to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut no immediate food, so I need to survive.\n\nThe grid has only 6x6 playable area, with snake length 5 after eating, so it might get tight.\n\nBut I can manuever.\n\nSince I have to output a sequence of 5 turns or more, but the state is at turn 5, so I need to specify actions for turn 5,6,7,8,9, etc.\n\nBut the food situation might change, but for now, only these foods.\n\nPerhaps for the first move, moving R is fine.\n\nBut let's see if moving D is better for long-term.\n\nMoving D to (2,4) at turn 5.\n\nThen positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nThen turn 6: from (2,4), move D to (2,3) (say)\n\nPositions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]  // tail at (2,6)\n\nThen turn 7: move D to (2,2)\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]  // tail at (2,5)\n\nThen turn 8: move R to (3,2)\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]  // tail at (2,4)\n\nThen turn 9: move R to (4,2)\n\nPositions: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]  // tail at (2,3)\n\nThen turn 10: move R to (5,2) but gone, or to (5,2) if it were there, but not, so move to (5,2) or to (5,3) or something.\n\nThen to (5,4) later.\n\nBut this takes longer to reach food, and I might be in a corner.\n\nWhereas with moving R, I eat sooner and can then move to open areas.\n\nAlso, after eating at (5,4), I am at x=5, y=4, which is not near walls, so I can go down or left or right.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,4), then to (4,3), (4,2), etc.\n\nOr move D to (5,3), then to (5,2) but gone, then to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut since (5,2) is gone, no issue.\n\nI think moving R at turn 5 is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction D, moving R is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)  // from (3,5), direction R, move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)  // from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)  // eat food\n\nThen for turn 9, I need to choose.\n\nAfter turn 8, positions: head at (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) as before.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 9: I can move D to (5,3), or L to (4,4), or R to (6,4)\n\nMoving D to (5,3) is fine.\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,3), move D to (5,2) but gone, or to other.\n\nBut to have a sequence, I can plan to go left or down.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should avoid boxing myself.\n\nFor example, after turn 8, move L to (4,4) at turn 9.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not specify too far, as food may spawn.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output 5 turns or so.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nAnswer format: for turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=5, so turns 5,6,7,8,9,...\n\nI can do 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nThen for turn 9, I need to choose.\n\nBut I have to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output up to turn 9 or 10.\n\nBut it might be flexible.\n\nSince after turn 8, I eat, and then I can move safely.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial position, when I move R to (3,5), it was the tail, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem safe.\n\nBut let's check if moving D or L has advantage.\n\nMoving L to (1,5) at turn 5.\n\nThen positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nThen I am on the left, and to go to food, I need to go right, but (2,5) is now body, so I have to go down or up.\n\nFor example, turn 6: from (1,5), direction L, so can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite).\n\nU to (1,6) - free? y=6, not wall.\n\nD to (1,4) - free.\n\nR to (2,5) but occupied by body, not safe.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nSay move D to (1,4)\n\nPositions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]  // tail at (2,6)\n\nThen turn 7: move D to (1,3) or R to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut it takes many moves to reach food, and I might not get there before it disappears or new food, but (5,4) has time, but inefficient.\n\nSo better to go towards food.\n\nThus, I think moving R at turn 5 is the best.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: R (right)\n\nTurn 6: R (right) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: R (right) to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: D (down) to (5,4) eat\n\nNow for turn 9, from (5,4), I need to move, say D to (5,3) or L to (4,4)\n\nTo keep options open, move L to (4,4) to go left.\n\nThen turn 10 from (4,4) move to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't require specifying beyond, but I need to output for several turns.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 5 to 9.\n\nSo for turn 9, I can choose D or L.\n\nSay move D to (5,3) to explore down.\n\nBut y=3, not too low.\n\nSince no food, it doesn't matter much.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, move L to (4,4) to center.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if at some point head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this sequence, no food on tail, so ok.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 5 to 9) based on the current state. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (5,4) with a longer life span (available until turn 13) to increase the snake's length and score, as the food at (5,2) cannot be reached before it disappears on turn 10 (Manhattan distance from (2,5) to (5,2) is 6, and only 4 moves are available by turn 9, making it impossible to eat by the deadline).\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n- Ensure the snake has room to maneuver after eating to avoid trapping itself, especially given the small grid size (6x6 playable area) and the internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 5)\n- **Snake positions**: Head at (2,5), body at (2,6), (3,6), tail at (3,5). Direction is down (D).\n- **Food**: \n  - (5,2): Value +1, life span 5 (available turns 5–9, disappears turn 10). Unreachable by turn 9 due to distance.\n  - (5,4): Value +1, life span 9 (available turns 5–13, disappears turn 14). Prioritize eating this.\n- **Possible moves from (2,5)**:\n  - **U (up) to (2,6)**: Not possible—occupied by body segment (not tail) and instant reverse from current direction D is invalid.\n  - **D (down) to (2,4)**: Safe and free.\n  - **L (left) to (1,5)**: Safe and free, but moves away from food and risks cornering the snake.\n  - **R (right) to (3,5)**: Safe—currently the tail position, and tail will move away.\n\n**Optimal immediate move (turn 5)**: Move R to (3,5). This:\n- Moves toward (5,4) efficiently (reduces Manhattan distance from 4 to 3).\n- Avoids the body and walls.\n- Keeps the snake centered for future flexibility.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 5–9)\n1. **Turn 5: Move R (right) to (3,5)**  \n   - New head position: (3,5)  \n   - New direction: R (right)  \n   - Snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]  \n   - Rationale: Moves toward (5,4) while avoiding risk. Tail at (3,6) vacates safely.\n\n2. **Turn 6: Move R (right) to (4,5)**  \n   - New head position: (4,5)  \n   - New direction: R (right)  \n   - Snake positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]  \n   - Rationale: Continues path to (5,4). (4,5) is free, and direction allows R (no reverse).\n\n3. **Turn 7: Move R (right) to (5,5)**  \n   - New head position: (5,5)  \n   - New direction: R (right)  \n   - Snake positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]  \n   - Rationale: Positions snake adjacent to (5,4) for eating next turn. (5,5) is free.\n\n4. **Turn 8: Move D (down) to (5,4)**  \n   - New head position: (5,4)  \n   - New direction: D (down)  \n   - Snake eats food: Length increases to 5, score +1.  \n   - Snake positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]  \n   - Rationale: Eats (5,4) efficiently on turn 8 (well before disappearance). Move D is valid (not opposite direction).\n\n5. **Turn 9: Move L (left) to (4,4)**  \n   - New head position: (4,4)  \n   - New direction: L (left)  \n   - Snake positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]  \n   - Rationale: After eating, avoids moving down toward the bottom wall (y=0) or right toward the border (x=7). Moves left to open space near the center for better maneuverability. (4,4) is free, and move L is valid (not opposite to D).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations Beyond Turn 9\n- **Survival focus**: After turn 9, the snake is in a flexible position at (4,4) with no immediate threats. From here, prioritize exploring open areas (e.g., move to (4,3), (3,4), or (5,4) if possible) to avoid walls and body collisions. The grid has space, but the snake is longer (length 5), so wide turns are needed.\n- **Food monitoring**: (5,2) is gone after turn 9, but new food may spawn. If food appears under the body, only eat it if the body moves away first.\n- **Risks avoided in this plan**:\n  - No collision with walls, obstacles, or body (tail movements handled safely).\n  - (5,2) was ignored as unreachable, preventing wasted moves.\n  - Turn 9 move to (4,4) avoids the \"tail reward danger\" (no food on tail) and keeps distance from the obstacle at (3,1).\n- **Contingency**: If new food spawns, adjust path to eat it while maintaining a buffer from walls and body.\n\nThis plan eats one positive food (score +1) by turn 8 and sets up for sustained survival. The sequence is output below.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 6: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 7: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 8: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 9: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and (0,0) is probably the bottom-left or top-left? I should define the coordinate system. Typically in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left, but since movement is given as U (y+1), D (y-1), etc., I need to be careful.\n\nFrom the movement constraints:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) – so increasing y might be up or down? It says U(x,y+1), which could mean that y increases as we go up, or down? Let's see the grid bounds. Walls at y=0 and y=7, so if U is (x,y+1), that might be moving towards higher y, which could be north if y=0 is south, or south if y=0 is north. But the head direction is given as \"R\" for right, so I should look at the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead is at (3,5), and head direction is R (right). Since head direction is R, that means moving right increases x, so x-axis is horizontal, left to right. Now, y: from positions, (3,5) to (2,5) – if head is at (3,5) and moving right, but next segment is (2,5), which is left of (3,5), so x=2 < x=3, so that means when the snake was moving left previously? Let's see the sequence.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), then (2,6), then (3,6). So from head to tail: (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (3,6). Head at (3,5), second segment at (2,5), which is left, so the snake was moving left when it went to (2,5), but now head direction is R, meaning it just turned right? But positions: (3,5) to (2,5) is left, so previous direction was L, but now it's R, which is possible since it might have turned.\n\nHead direction is given as current direction, which is R. So for the next move, since it's moving right, from (3,5) to (4,5) if it continues right.\n\nBut let's list the positions:\n\n- Segment 0 (head): (3,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,6) – tail\n\nNow, from tail to head: tail is (3,6), then (2,6), then (2,5), then head (3,5). So the snake body: from (3,6) to (2,6) is left (x decrease), then from (2,6) to (2,5) is down (y decrease), then from (2,5) to (3,5) is right (x increase). But head is at (3,5) with direction R, so it moved right to get there.\n\nFor movement, the head direction is the current direction it's facing, which is R, so from (3,5), possible moves: R to (4,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5). But L to (2,5) is the body segment, which might be occupied, but we need to check collision rules.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves, so it's safe to move to the tail cell only if the tail is moving away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment is deadly except for the tail cell, because after movement, the tail moves, so that cell is free.\n\nIn this case, from (3,5), if I move L to (2,5), that is segment 1, which is not the tail. Tail is (3,6). So moving to (2,5) would collide with body segment, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (3,6) is U, to (3,6), which is the tail? (3,6) is segment 3, the tail. So moving to tail cell is safe because after moving, the tail will move away.\n\nNow, (3,6) is tail, so moving to (3,6) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (4,5) is right, which is empty.\n\nMoving to (3,4) is down, empty.\n\nNow, walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7. So (3,5) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1) – but that's not near, so ignore for now.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1.\n\nLife span: for (5,2), life span 4 at turn 6, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning it counts down each turn including current, so after turn 6, life span decreases to 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 at turn 10, and disappears. Similarly for (5,4), life span 8, disappears after 8 turns from now.\n\nBut we need to think about when to eat them.\n\nNow, my goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. I need to know y-direction. From movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, and D decreases y, and walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Or vice versa? Let's see.\n\nIn positions: snake at (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). If U is (x,y+1), and from (2,5) to (2,6) is U, since y increased from 5 to 6, so (2,5) to (2,6) is up. Similarly, from (3,6) to (3,5)? Positions are head to tail, but movement was from previous.\n\nPerhaps y increases upwards, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nFor example, (2,5) to (2,6) is up to y=6, then to (3,6) is right to x=3.\n\nHead at (3,5), which is below (3,6) since y=5 < y=6.\n\nSo y=0 is bottom, y=7 top; x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1), which is at x=3,y=1.\n\nNow, food: (5,2) at x=5,y=2, value 1, life span 4\n\n(5,4) at x=5,y=4, value 1, life span 8\n\nCurrent turn: 6\n\nSnake: head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5):\n\n- R: (4,5) - empty\n\n- U: (3,6) - currently occupied by tail (3,6), but since tail will move, it's safe\n\n- D: (3,4) - empty\n\n- L: (2,5) - occupied by body segment 1, not tail, so collision, deadly\n\nSo L is not possible.\n\nTherefore, possible actions: R, U, D\n\nNow, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's see the snake body after moving.\n\nCurrent positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nAfter one move:\n\nIf move R to (4,5), then head moves to (4,5), body: the segment that was head is now body, so new positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] and tail (3,6) is removed? No, when moving, the snake moves forward, so if not eating, tail is removed.\n\nCore rules: when eating food, length increases, so tail not removed. When not eating, tail is removed, and head moves to new cell.\n\nStandard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail cell is vacated.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail is removed, so length same.\n\nIf food eaten, tail not removed, length increases by one.\n\nHere, when moving, if head moves to food cell, it eats it, and length increases, else tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- To (4,5): not food, so after move, positions: head (4,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (2,5), then (2,6), and tail (3,6) is removed? Positions: new head at new position, then the old positions except the tail is cut.\n\nSequence: after moving to (4,5), the body segments follow: segment 0 (new head) at (4,5), segment 1 at old head (3,5), segment 2 at old segment 1 (2,5), segment 3 at old segment 2 (2,6), and old segment 3 (3,6) is removed since no food eaten. But old segment 2 is (2,6), which was position 2, and old segment 3 is (3,6) tail.\n\nNew positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (3,6): (3,6) has food? Currently, food is at (5,2) and (5,4), not at (3,6), so no food. So moving to (3,6) eats nothing? But (3,6) is occupied by tail, but since we move there, and tail moves away, it should be fine, and no food eaten, so new positions: head at (3,6), then old head (3,5) becomes body, then (2,5), then (2,6), and tail removed? Old tail was (3,6), but we moved head to (3,6), which was tail, so now head at (3,6), then (3,5), then (2,5), then (2,6) as new tail? Old positions: head (3,5), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6)\n\nAfter moving U to (3,6): new head at (3,6), then the body: old head (3,5) becomes seg1, old seg1 (2,5) becomes seg2, old seg2 (2,6) becomes seg3 (tail), and old seg3 (3,6) is gone, but since we moved to it, it's occupied by head now.\n\nNew positions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (3,4): new positions [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) free.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to get to the food. Foods at (5,2) and (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is closer, at same x, y=4 vs head y=5, so down.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nAlso, life span: (5,2) has life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, so by turn 10 it's gone. Since current turn is 6, after this move, turn 7, life span decreases to 3, then turn 8:2, turn 9:1, turn 10:0 gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life span 8, disappears at turn 14.\n\nNow, (5,4) is at y=4, x=5, head at (3,5), so to reach (5,4), need to go right to x=5 and down to y=4.\n\nFrom (3,5), to (5,4): can go right then down, or down then right, etc.\n\nBut need to avoid walls and body.\n\nAlso, the body will move.\n\nMoreover, there is a risk with tail if eating food when head adjacent to tail.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves for turn 6.\n\nActions: R, U, D (L not possible)\n\nNow, think about the future.\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), then from there, I can go R again to (5,5), or U to (4,6), or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if U to (3,6), then from there, possible moves.\n\nOr D to (3,4).\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (5,4), which is closer and has longer life, so maybe prioritize that.\n\n(5,2) has short life, only 4 turns left, so I might miss it if I don't go soon.\n\nFrom turn 6, after move, turn 7, life span (5,2) becomes 3, then turn 8:2, turn 9:1, turn 10:0 gone.\n\nSo to eat (5,2), I need to reach it by turn 9 at latest, since at turn 10 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) by turn 13.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), (5,2) is at x=5,y=2, so delta x=2, delta y=3 down.\n\nMinimum moves: 2 right, 3 down, but not necessarily direct, and need to avoid obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is x=5,y=4, delta x=2, delta y=1 down.\n\nSo closer.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, which might block paths.\n\nBut since both foods are positive, eating is good.\n\nNow, also, the internal obstacle at (3,1), but y=1 is low, and (5,2) is at y=2, so might be relevant if going down.\n\nFirst, let's simulate each option.\n\nOption 1: Turn 6, move R to (4,5)\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nHead direction now R? After moving right, direction is R.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5): R to (5,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, not tail, so collision, deadly. So L not possible.\n\nSo possible: R, U, D\n\nNow, from (4,5), if I want to go to (5,4), I can go D to (4,4) then R to (5,4), or R to (5,5) then D to (5,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) has food, so if I go to (5,4) in one or two moves.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (5,4) is not adjacent, diagonal, so need two moves: e.g., R then D, or D then R, or other ways.\n\nR to (5,5) then D to (5,4), or D to (4,4) then R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is food, so if head moves to (5,4), it eats it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is below.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, after move to (4,5), positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nTail is at (2,6)\n\nNow, (5,4) is at (5,4), not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,4).\n\nSuppose turn 6: R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7: D to (4,4) – now (4,4) is empty? Yes, currently.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6) removed? No food at (4,4), so tail removed.\n\nAfter move to (4,4), new positions: head (4,4), then old head (4,5) becomes body, then (3,5), then (2,5), and old tail (2,6) removed. So positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5)\n\nNow from (4,4), I can go R to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\n(5,4) has food, so move to (5,4): eats food, length increases, so tail not removed.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,4), then previous positions: (4,4) becomes body, (4,5) body, (3,5) body, (2,5) tail. Since eating, tail not removed, so length 5 now: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nAnd (5,4) food eaten, removed.\n\nNow, life span of (5,4) was 8, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nNow, we have another food at (5,2), life span decreasing.\n\nAfter eating, snake is at (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nHead at (5,4), direction after moving R? From (4,4) to (5,4) is R, so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R to (6,4), but x=6, wall at x=7, so x=6 is ok, x=7 wall.\n\nx=6 is not wall, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is free.\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, not tail, so collision, deadly. So L not possible.\n\nSo possible: R, U, D.\n\nNow, (5,2) is at (5,2), which is down from (5,4), so I can go D to (5,3), then D to (5,2) to eat.\n\nBut (5,2) life span: at turn 6, life span 4. After turn 6 move, turn 7, life span 3; turn 8, life span 2; turn 9, life span 1; turn 10, 0 gone.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5) – turn 7\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4) – turn 8\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4) eat food – turn 9\n\nNow at turn 9, head at (5,4), but we just ate, so now from (5,4), we can go to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), head at (5,4), so move D to (5,3) or directly? Not adjacent.\n\n(5,4) to (5,2) is two steps down.\n\nAt turn 9, head at (5,4), move to (5,3) say.\n\nBut (5,2) life span: at turn 9, life span should be 1? Let's track:\n\nTurn 6: current, life span (5,2)=4\n\nAfter turn 6 action (move to (4,5)), turn 7 starts, life span decreases to 3\n\nAfter turn 7 action (move to (4,4)), turn 8 starts, life span 2\n\nAfter turn 8 action (move to (5,4) and eat), turn 9 starts, life span (5,2) is 1? But (5,2) not eaten yet.\n\nAt the start of turn 9, life span of (5,2) is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it exists during turn t, and after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, disappears.\n\nFrom rules: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\" meaning after N turns, it's gone.\n\nSo for food with life span N at turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n\nAt turn t, life span N, it can be eaten during turn t, then after turn t, life span N-1, and so on.\n\nFor (5,2), at turn 6, life span 4, so:\n\n- Turn 6: can be eaten, life span 4\n\n- After turn 6, life span 3 for turn 7\n\n- Turn 7: can be eaten, life span 3\n\n- After turn 7, life span 2 for turn 8\n\n- Turn 8: can be eaten, life span 2\n\n- After turn 8, life span 1 for turn 9\n\n- Turn 9: can be eaten, life span 1\n\n- After turn 9, life span 0, disappears, not available turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life span 8 at turn 6:\n\n- Turn 6 to 13: exists, turn 14 disappears.\n\nBack to sequence.\n\nIn the path I had:\n\nTurn 6: move to (4,5) – not eat (5,2), so (5,2) life span decreases to 3 after turn 6.\n\nTurn 7: move to (4,4) – not eat, life span (5,2) now 3 at turn 7 start, after turn 7 decreases to 2.\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,4) eat (5,4) – not eat (5,2), life span (5,2) decreases to 1 after turn 8.\n\nTurn 9: head at (5,4), move to say (5,3) – down, to (5,3)\n\nNew positions: since not eating, tail removed. Previous positions before move: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,3): head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) – tail (2,5) removed? Since no eat, tail removed, so positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)] and (3,5) removed? Old positions: segments: head (5,4), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), new head (5,3), then old head (5,4) seg1, old seg1 (4,4) seg2, old seg2 (4,5) seg3, old seg3 (3,5) seg4? Since no eat, tail is removed, so only four segments: head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5) – and (3,5) is free, (2,5) free.\n\nList: new positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ] since old tail (3,5) removed.\n\nNow at turn 9, head at (5,3), and (5,2) is below, life span 1, so if I move D to (5,2), I can eat it.\n\nMove to (5,2): eats food, so tail not removed, new positions: head (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) – length 5.\n\nAnd (5,2) eaten.\n\nSo in this sequence, I ate both foods: (5,4) on turn 8, (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 8 ate (5,4), turn 9 ate (5,2).\n\n(5,2) life span was 1 at turn 9, eaten, good.\n\nNow, is this safe? In this path, no collision.\n\nBut let's see the moves: turn 6: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: R to (5,4) eat\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,3) – but in turn 9, from (5,4) I moved to (5,3), but I could have moved directly to (5,2)? No, not adjacent, so must go to (5,3) first.\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,3) to (5,2) eat.\n\nIn my earlier, I said turn 9 move to (5,3), then turn 10 to (5,2), but at turn 9, after moving to (5,3), it's turn 10? Let's clarify turn numbering.\n\nTurn t1=6: we choose action for turn 6.\n\nAfter action, state updates for next turn.\n\nAt start of turn 6, state given.\n\nWe choose action for turn 6.\n\nAfter executing action, turn becomes 7, etc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nStart turn 6: state as given.\n\nAction for turn 6: move R to (4,5) – no eat.\n\nAfter move, positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] – tail (3,6) removed.\n\nLife span: after turn 6, (5,2) life span decreases to 3, (5,4) to 7? (5,4) life span was 8 at turn 6, after turn 6, decreases to 7 for turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: start with head at (4,5), etc.\n\nAction for turn 7: move D to (4,4) – no food, so positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] – tail (2,6) removed.\n\nLife span: after turn 7, (5,2) decreases to 2, (5,4) to 6? After turn 7, (5,2) life span 2 for turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: head at (4,4), move R to (5,4) – eat (5,4), so positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), and since eat, tail not removed, so add new segment, positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] and (2,5) was tail, but not removed, so seg4 (2,5)? Old positions before move: head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) and eat: new head (5,4), old head (4,4) seg1, old seg1 (4,5) seg2, old seg2 (3,5) seg3, old seg3 (2,5) seg4, tail. Since eat, no removal, length 5.\n\nLife span: after turn 8, (5,2) decreases to 1 for turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: head at (5,4), move D to (5,3) – no food, so positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) – tail (2,5) removed? Since no eat, tail removed: old tail (2,5) removed, so positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)] and (3,5) free.\n\nLife span: after turn 9, (5,2) decreases to 0, disappears, not available.\n\nBut at turn 9, (5,2) still exists with life span 1.\n\nNow head at (5,3), (5,2) is directly below.\n\nTurn 10: move D to (5,2) – eat (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) – and since eat, tail not removed, length 5? Old positions before move: head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) and eat: new head (5,2), old head (5,3) seg1, old seg1 (5,4) seg2, old seg2 (4,4) seg3, old seg3 (4,5) seg4, tail. Length 5.\n\nBut (5,2) eaten on turn 10, but after turn 9, life span decreased to 0, so at turn 10, it should not exist.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt turn 9, after turn 9 action, life span decreases.\n\nStart of turn 9: (5,2) life span 1, exists.\n\nAfter turn 9 action (move to (5,3)), no eat, so after move, turn 10 starts, life span decreases to 0, so (5,2) disappears, not available for turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 10, I move to (5,2), but (5,2) is gone, so no food, just move to empty cell.\n\nBut (5,2) was there at turn 9, but I didn't move to it on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, head at (5,4), I moved to (5,3), but (5,2) is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to (5,4), so I couldn't eat it directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), to reach (5,2), I need to go to (5,3) first, but (5,3) is empty, no food, so on turn 9, I move to (5,3), and at that point, (5,2) is still there, but I'm not on it.\n\nThen after turn 9, life span decreases to 0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 10, (5,2) is not there, so moving to (5,2) is just empty, no eat.\n\nThus, I missed (5,2).\n\nIn this sequence, I ate (5,4) on turn 8, but (5,2) disappeared before I could eat it.\n\nTo eat (5,2), I need to reach it by turn 9 at latest.\n\nIn the above, on turn 9, I was at (5,4), could I have gone directly down? But (5,4) to (5,2) not adjacent, so no.\n\nFrom earlier position, on turn 8, I was at (4,4), I went to (5,4) to eat (5,4), but instead, I could go down to (4,3) or something to reach (5,2) faster.\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), head on turn 6 at (3,5), turn 7 at (4,5), turn 8 at (4,4) or other.\n\nMinimum moves to (5,2): from (3,5) to (5,2) is 2 right, 3 down, so 5 moves, but with body, it might take more.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go down immediately.\n\nOption: turn 6 move D to (3,4)\n\nThen positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] – tail (3,6) removed.\n\nLife span after turn 6: (5,2) to 3.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4), possible moves: R to (4,4), U to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, not tail, collision, deadly; D to (3,3), L to (2,4) or something.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nTail is (2,6)\n\nPossible moves: R to (4,4) – empty; D to (3,3) – empty; U to (3,5) – body, collision; L to (2,4) – empty? (2,4) not occupied.\n\n(2,4) is empty.\n\nSo possible: R, D, L.\n\nNow, to go to (5,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nSay turn 7 move R to (4,4) – no eat.\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] – tail (2,6) removed.\n\nLife span after turn 7: (5,2) to 2.\n\nTurn 8: head at (4,4), move R to (5,4) but (5,4) has food, but I want (5,2)? If I move to (5,4), I eat it, but then I might miss (5,2).\n\nMove to (5,4) eat, positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) – length 5.\n\nLife span after turn 8: (5,2) to 1 for turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: head at (5,4), move D to (5,3) – no eat, positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] tail (3,5) removed? Old tail (2,5) removed, positions: head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (3,4)\n\nLife span after turn 9: (5,2) to 0, gone.\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (5,2) – empty, no food.\n\nMissed (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 8, instead of going to (5,4), go down to (4,3) to reach (5,2).\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4), move D to (4,3) – no food, positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)] tail (2,5) removed.\n\nLife span after turn 8: (5,2) to 1 for turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: head at (4,3), (5,2) is at (5,2), adjacent right-down? Not adjacent, (4,3) to (5,2) is not adjacent, need to move.\n\nPossible moves: R to (5,3), U to (4,4) body? Positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n\nU to (4,4) is body, collision; D to (4,2), R to (5,3), L to (3,3).\n\nSo possible: D, R, L.\n\nMove R to (5,3) – no food, positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] tail (3,5) removed.\n\n(5,2) life span 1 at turn 9, still exists.\n\nAfter move, turn 10 starts, (5,2) life span 0, gone.\n\nHead at (5,3), can move to (5,2) on turn 10, but no food.\n\nIf on turn 9, from (4,3), move directly to (5,2)? Not possible, not adjacent.\n\nSo cannot eat (5,2) in time.\n\nTo eat (5,2), I need to be at (5,2) by turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 6, I have 3 moves to reach it: turns 6,7,8 to move, and on turn 8 action, if I move to (5,2), it is eaten at turn 8.\n\nLife span at turn 6:4, if eaten on turn 8, life span when eaten is 2, but it can be eaten as long as life span >0 when moved to.\n\nAt turn 8, life span is 2 (after turn 7 decrease), so can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, turn 9 life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nBut to reach by turn 8.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (5,2): need to move right twice and down three times, but since each move is one step, minimum 5 moves, but I have only 3 moves to turn 8 action? From turn 6 to turn 8 action is two moves? Turn actions:\n\nTurn 6 action: move to new cell\n\nTurn 7 action: move to new cell\n\nTurn 8 action: move to new cell, which could be (5,2)\n\nSo from turn 6 to turn 8, I make three moves: turn 6,7,8.\n\nStart at (3,5) turn 6.\n\nAfter turn 6 move, at new position turn 7.\n\nAfter turn 7 move, at new position turn 8.\n\nAfter turn 8 move, at new position for turn 9.\n\nTo be at (5,2) after turn 8 move, so that on turn 8 action, I move to (5,2) and eat it.\n\nSo from (3,5), in three moves, can I reach (5,2)?\n\nDelta x=2, delta y=3, so |delta x| + |delta y| = 5, but I have only three moves, so impossible to reach in three moves because Manhattan distance is 5, each move changes one coordinate by 1.\n\nManhattan distance from (3,5) to (5,2) is |5-3| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5, so at least 5 moves required.\n\nWith three moves, I can only reduce distance by 3, so I can get to, say, (4,4) or (4,3) etc., but not to (5,2).\n\nFor example, after three moves, I might be at (4,4) or (5,3) etc., but not (5,2).\n\n(5,2) requires exactly 5 moves.\n\nBut I have from turn 6 to turn 8: three actions, so after three moves, I am at a cell like (4,4) or something, not (5,2).\n\nThe earliest I can reach (5,2) is in 5 moves, on turn 10, but turn 10 it disappears.\n\nTurn 10 action is too late, as after turn 9, life span 0.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,2) at all, because by the time I can reach it, it's gone.\n\nMinimum distance 5 moves, but:\n\nTurn 6: move, say, D to (3,4) - distance to (5,2): |2| + |2| =4? From (3,4) to (5,2): |5-3| + |2-4| =2 + 2=4\n\nThen turn 7: move, say, R to (4,4) - from (4,4) to (5,2): |1| + |2| =3\n\nTurn 8: move, say, D to (4,3) - from (4,3) to (5,2): |1| + |1| =2\n\nNot there.\n\nTo reach (5,2) in fewer moves? Impossible, Manhattan distance.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 8, I make moves on turn 6,7,8, so three moves, each reducing distance by at most 1, so from distance 5, after three moves, distance at least 2, so cannot reach (5,2) by turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, by turn 9: four moves.\n\nTurn 6,7,8,9 actions.\n\nAfter turn 9 move, I can be at (5,2).\n\nAt turn 9 action, I move to (5,2) and eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 9, life span is 1, so can be eaten.\n\nSo possible to eat on turn 9.\n\nFor example, sequence:\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4)  // down to y=4\n\nPositions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] tail removed\n\nLife after turn 6: (5,2) span 3\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,4)  // right to x=4\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] \n\nLife after turn 7: (5,2) span 2\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3)  // down to y=3\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)] tail removed\n\nLife after turn 8: (5,2) span 1 for turn 9\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,3) or to (5,2)? From (4,3), to (5,2) not adjacent, so move R to (5,3) first? But (5,3) not food.\n\nMove to (5,3): positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] \n\nThen turn 10: move to (5,2) but no food.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be adjacent to (5,2) on turn 8 or something.\n\nOn turn 8, from (4,3), I can move to (5,2) only if I can, but (4,3) to (5,2) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share edge, so (4,3) to (5,2) is diagonal, not allowed. Must move to (4,2), (4,4), (5,3), or (3,3).\n\nNone of which is (5,2).\n\nSo from (4,3), I can move to (5,3) or (4,2) etc., but not to (5,2) directly.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (5,3) or (4,2), I can move to (5,2) if adjacent.\n\nFor example, if on turn 8 I am at (5,3), then turn 9 move D to (5,2) eat.\n\nBut to be at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nFrom start:\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)  // as before\n\nThen turn 7: move D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 8: move to (5,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 7, move D to (4,3) on turn 8 action.\n\nThen at (4,3) on turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9 move to (5,3) or (5,2) but not directly to (5,2).\n\nIf move to (5,3) on turn 9, then turn 10 to (5,2) but late.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3)  // at (4,3) turn 8\n\nThen turn 9: move R to (5,3)  // at (5,3) turn 9\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (5,2) but no food.\n\nNot good.\n\nTurn 6: move directly towards (5,2).\n\nBut with body, it might be blocked.\n\nAnother way: turn 6 move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3)  // at (4,3) turn 8\n\nSame as above.\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), turn 6 move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4) or move R to (5,5)\n\nIf move R to (5,5) on turn 7:\n\nAfter turn 6 move to (4,5), positions [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nTurn 7 move R to (5,5) - no food, positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] tail removed\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5), move D to (5,4) to eat (5,4) or move to (5,3)? (5,4) has food.\n\nIf move to (5,4) eat, then at (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nThen for (5,2), on turn 9 move D to (5,3), turn 10 to (5,2) no.\n\nIf on turn 8 from (5,5), move D to (5,4) eat, same.\n\nOr move directly to (5,3) on turn 8? From (5,5) to (5,3) not adjacent.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nPerhaps I cannot eat (5,2) because it's too far and life span too short.\n\nManhattan distance 5, and only 4 turns to act (turns 6,7,8,9), but to reach on turn 9, I need to move to it on turn 9 action, so I need to be adjacent on turn 8.\n\nFor example, on turn 8, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (5,2), like (5,3), (4,2), (6,2), or (5,1).\n\n(5,3) is above, (4,2) left, etc.\n\nThen on turn 9, move to (5,2) eat.\n\nSo I need to be at one of those on turn 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), in two moves, can I be at (5,3) or (4,2) etc.?\n\nFor example, to (5,3): from (3,5) to (5,3) Manhattan |2| + |2| =4, need 4 moves, but in two moves? Impossible.\n\nTurn 6 and turn 7 actions, after two moves, I can be at (4,4) or (3,3) etc., not (5,3).\n\nSo with two moves, I can reduce distance by at most 2, from 5 to at least 3, so cannot be adjacent to (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nThus, it is impossible to eat (5,2) because the life span is too short and distance too far.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore (5,2) and focus on (5,4) which has longer life.\n\nAlso, there might be other risks.\n\nBut in the state, only two foods, both positive.\n\nNow, back to turn 6 choices.\n\nPossible actions: R, U, D\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), what happens?\n\nTurn 6 move U to (3,6) - (3,6) is tail, so safe, no food there, so positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] tail removed? Old tail (3,6) is now head, so new positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6) tail.\n\nLife span after turn 6: (5,2) to 3, (5,4) to 7.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves: R to (4,6), U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, deadly; D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision; L to (2,6) body, collision? Positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) tail.\n\nL to (2,6): (2,6) is tail, so moving to tail is safe, because tail will move.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,6) empty, U to (3,7) wall, deadly, D to (3,5) body, not tail, collision.\n\nSo possible: R or L.\n\nL to (2,6) is tail, safe.\n\nBut L might not be productive.\n\nMove R to (4,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,4) etc.\n\nBut let's see the food.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), from (4,6) I can go down.\n\nBut I have time.\n\nSince (5,2) is unattainable, I should go for (5,4).\n\nBut also, there is the risk of tail reward danger, but not now.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant yet.\n\nAlso, when moving, I need to think about survival.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,6) on turn 6, then I might be cornered.\n\nLet's list a plan to eat (5,4).\n\nFrom (3,5), move R to (4,5) as before.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), then R to (5,4) to eat on turn 8.\n\nAs in the first sequence.\n\nAfter eating, I am at (5,4), with body around.\n\nThen I need to find a way to survive and maybe eat other food, but only one food left, (5,2), which I can't eat, so after eating (5,4), I can just move around.\n\nBut the grid has walls, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAfter eating (5,4) on turn 8, positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 5.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R to (6,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) body, deadly.\n\nSo R, U, D.\n\nNow, (5,3) is empty, (6,4) empty, (5,5) empty.\n\nI can go down to (5,3), then to (5,2) but no food, or left, etc.\n\nBut since (5,2) is gone, no issue.\n\nI need to think about long-term survival.\n\nThe snake is in the top-right area, and the grid is 8x8.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,1), but far.\n\nAnother option on turn 6: move D to (3,4)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,4).\n\nFor example, turn 6: D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 7: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: R to (5,4) eat.\n\nSame as before, eat on turn 8.\n\nOr from (3,4), turn 7 move R to (4,4), turn 8 move to (5,4).\n\nBut in this case, on turn 8 I eat.\n\nIf I move U on turn 6, to (3,6), then I have fewer options.\n\nFor example, turn 6 U to (3,6)\n\nThen only can move R to (4,6) or L to (2,6)\n\nSay move R to (4,6)\n\nThen positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] tail (2,6) removed? Old tail (2,6) removed, positions: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5)\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves: R to (5,6), D to (4,5), U to (4,7) wall, deadly; L to (3,6) body, collision.\n\nSo R or D.\n\nMove D to (4,5), then similar to before.\n\nOr move R to (5,6), then down to (5,5), then to (5,4), but slower.\n\nTo eat (5,4), it takes more turns.\n\nSince (5,4) has long life, it's ok, but I might want to eat it soon to grow and have more space.\n\nBut the snake is small, length 4, grid 8x8, plenty of space.\n\nBut to maximize score, since only two foods, and I can only eat one, (5,4), because (5,2) is impossible, so eating one is fine.\n\nBut both are +1, so eating one gives score 1.\n\nBut perhaps I can eat both if possible, but we saw not.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no.\n\nIn this case, for (5,2), it might be under something, but no.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, after eating, the tail might be close.\n\nBut in the sequence where I eat (5,4) on turn 8, the tail is at (2,5), head at (5,4), not adjacent.\n\nThen I move down to (5,3), tail at (3,5) or something, not adjacent.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nNow, back to turn 6 actions.\n\nI think moving R or D are both fine to reach (5,4).\n\nMoving U to (3,6) might be riskier because it's near the top.\n\nFor example, at (3,6), y=6, close to y=7 wall.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then I have to move R or L, say R to (4,6), then from (4,6), I can only move R or D, not up or left easily.\n\nBut I can go down to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut it might lead to dead end later, but not immediately.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate the future.\n\nBut with the body moving, it's dynamic.\n\nPerhaps for now, moving R or D is better.\n\nAlso, the head direction: current direction R, if I move D, it's not reverse, since reverse would be L, which is not possible anyway.\n\nMove D is perpendicular, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, U is perpendicular.\n\nNo instant reverse constraint only applies if moving opposite, but here L is not possible.\n\nSo all R, U, D are valid.\n\nNow, let's choose to move R to (4,5) on turn 6, then D to (4,4) on turn 7, then R to (5,4) on turn 8 to eat.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (5,4), I need to move, say D to (5,3), then on turn 10 to (5,2) or elsewhere.\n\nBut (5,2) gone, so no food.\n\nThen I can explore the grid.\n\nBut to avoid starvation, I should move to open areas.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), after eating, go down to (5,3), then to (5,2) but empty, then to (5,1) but y=1, and internal obstacle at (3,1), but not blocking.\n\nOr go right to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut no more food, so survival is key, but since no negative food, I can just keep moving without eating, but to maximize turns, but the goal is to maximize score, which comes from eating food, so after eating, I can survive as long as possible to eat future food, but in this state, only two foods are given, and no mention of new food spawning, so probably only these foods exist.\n\nThe state gives current food positions, so I think no new food spawns, only these two.\n\nSo once I eat (5,4), and (5,2) is gone, no more food, so score is 1.\n\nIf I don't eat, score 0.\n\nBut I can eat (5,4), so better to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D first, same thing.\n\nBut let's see if moving U is better for some reason.\n\nSuppose turn 6 move U to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 7 move R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 8 move D to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 9 move D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 10 move R to (5,4) eat.\n\nBut on turn 10, (5,4) still exists since life span 8, at turn 10, life span 8 - (10-6) = 8-4=4, still there.\n\nBut I eat later, but same score.\n\nAnd it takes more turns, but since no other food, it doesn't matter, I still eat one.\n\nBut in this case, I use more turns, but score same, and I might have risk near walls.\n\nFor example, at (4,6), close to top.\n\nThen moving down.\n\nBut possible.\n\nTo eat faster, moving R or D directly is better.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but since I'm not going there, irrelevant.\n\nAlso, special case: food under body, but not here.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, no food under tail, so no issue.\n\nFor example, tail is at (3,6), no food there.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nSo I think moving R to (4,5) on turn 6 is fine.\n\nThen turn 7 move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8 move R to (5,4) eat.\n\nThen for turn 9, I need to move, say D to (5,3)\n\nBut since we need to output actions for 5+ turns, the answer should include multiple turns.\n\nThe output format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for several turns.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the sequence starting from current turn.\n\n\"Answer Format: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I should plan a sequence.\n\nSince after eating, no food, I just need to avoid dying.\n\nFor example, after turn 8, at (5,4), I can go to (5,3), then to (5,2), then to (5,1), but y=1, and wall at y=0, so cannot go below y=1? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is safe.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go left or right.\n\nBut to keep moving.\n\nSince the grid has internal obstacle at (3,1), but not blocking directly.\n\nI can go right to (6,4), (7,4) but x=7 wall, so (6,4) then (6,3) etc.\n\nBut no food, so it doesn't matter for score.\n\nBut to survive long, I should avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (5,4) is open.\n\nAfter eating at (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nHead at (5,4), I can move D to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) tail removed? No eat, so tail (2,5) removed, positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move D to (5,2) but no food, or L to (4,3), or R to (6,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, I can keep moving.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output for 5 turns or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=6.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 6,7,8,9,10, etc., but since the state changes, I should output a fixed sequence based on current state.\n\nBut after actions, state changes, so I need to plan assuming no other changes, but food life span decreases.\n\nIn the sequence, I can plan for the next few turns.\n\nSince (5,2) is impossible, I focus on (5,4).\n\nSo for turn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4)  // eat\n\nThen for turn 9: from (5,4), move D to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,3), move D to (5,2)  // empty\n\nOr to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut to be safe, I can move to (6,4) or something.\n\nAfter turn 8, head at (5,4), after moving R, direction R.\n\nThen turn 9: move R to (6,4)\n\nThen positions: not eat, so tail removed, positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)  // (3,5) removed\n\nThen from (6,4), move to (6,3), (6,5), (7,4) but x=7 wall, so not (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is wall, since x=7 border.\n\nSo from (6,4), can move U to (6,5), D to (6,3), or L to (5,4) body, collision, so not L.\n\nR to (7,4) wall, deadly.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nSay move D to (6,3).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the output, I can list up to turn 10 or so.\n\nSince the food (5,2) is there, but I can't eat it, but in case I can, but we decided not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps from the beginning, if I move down, I can get closer to (5,2), but still, with life span 4, I can't reach in time.\n\nFor example, turn 6 move D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 7 move D to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 8 move R to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 9 move R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10 move D to (5,2) no food.\n\nNot eaten.\n\nOr turn 8 from (3,3) move R to (4,3), turn 9 move to (5,3), same.\n\nIf I move directly right and down faster.\n\nBut no, distance is fixed.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat (5,2).\n\nTherefore, for turn 6, I should move towards (5,4), either R or D.\n\nMoving R might be better because it's in the current direction.\n\nOr moving D to go down, but (5,4) is at y=4, head at y=5, so down is towards it.\n\nSimilarly, right is towards it.\n\nBut moving R keeps x increasing.\n\nAlso, the body is to the left, so moving right opens space.\n\nWhereas moving down, to (3,4), then body above.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nI think I'll go with moving R on turn 6.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nAlso, need to consider the life span for (5,4), but it's long, no issue.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nLet's plan a sequence for 5 turns: turn 6 to turn 10.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)  // to go down towards (5,4)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4)  // eat\n\nNow turn 9: from (5,4), move D to (5,3)  // down to avoid walls\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3), move R to (6,3)  // right to open space\n\nFrom (5,3), after moving D, direction D? From (5,4) to (5,3) is D, so direction D.\n\nThen move R to (6,3) is perpendicular, ok.\n\nPositions: after turn 8 eat, positions [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 9 move D to (5,3): not eat, so positions: head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), tail (3,5) removed? Old tail (2,5) removed, so positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 10 move R to (6,3): not eat, positions: head (6,3), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (4,4), tail (4,5) removed? Old tail (4,5) removed, positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for output, up to turn 10 might be enough.\n\nSince think 5+ turns, output 5 actions.\n\nt1=6, so turns 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nActions: R, D, R, D, R\n\nBut on turn 9, move D, turn 10 move R.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving U on turn 6 is better, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 6, if I move D to (3,4), then turn 7 move R to (4,4), turn 8 move R to (5,4) eat, same as before.\n\nThen turn 9 move D to (5,3), turn 10 move R to (6,3), similar.\n\nSo both sequences similar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score, the AI must eat the positive food at (5,4) while avoiding the food at (5,2) due to its short remaining lifespan (4 turns), which makes it impossible to reach before it disappears. The Manhattan distance from the starting position (3,5) to (5,2) is 5, and with only 4 turns (6 to 9) to act before it disappears after turn 9, the snake cannot reduce the distance sufficiently to reach it. Therefore, the plan prioritizes eating (5,4), which has a longer lifespan (8 turns) and is closer.\n\nThe sequence below ensures the snake eats (5,4) on turn 8 while maintaining a safe path for survival beyond. Movements are chosen to avoid collisions, walls, and dead ends:\n- **Turn 6**: Move right (R) to (4,5) to progress toward (5,4) and open space.\n- **Turn 7**: Move down (D) to (4,4) to align vertically with (5,4) and avoid the top wall.\n- **Turn 8**: Move right (R) to (5,4) to eat the food, increasing length to 5.\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (5,3) to move away from walls and create space for future movement.\n- **Turn 10**: Move right (R) to (6,3) to explore open areas and avoid potential dead ends.\n\nThis sequence eats one food (+1 score) and positions the snake in the lower-right area for long-term survival. After turn 10, the snake can continue moving safely (e.g., down to (6,2) or up to (6,4)) as no more food is available.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 7: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 8: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 9: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 10: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's 8 units wide and high, with walls on the borders.\n\nCurrent turn is t=7.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments at (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So let's plot this:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n- Body: (3,5)\n- Body: (2,5)\n- Tail: (2,6)\n\nSnake head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood items:\n\n1. At (5,2) with life_span=3, value=1 (positive)\n2. At (5,4) with life_span=7, value=1 (positive)\n3. At (4,2) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive here, no negative food mentioned.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nWalls are borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1)\n\nSnake: head at (4,5), body at (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So the snake is forming a sort of L-shape or something.\n\n(4,5) - head\n\n(3,5) - body\n\n(2,5) - body\n\n(2,6) - tail\n\nFrom (2,5) to (2,6), so it went down from (2,5) to (2,6)? Positions are given in order, head first, so the segment after head is (3,5), which is left of head, then (2,5), left again, then (2,6) which is down from (2,5). So the snake was moving left to (2,5), then down to (2,6). But current head direction is R, meaning at turn 7, the head is at (4,5) and just moved right to there? Head direction is the current moving direction, so at turn 7, the snake is facing right, meaning it came from left? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nSince head is at (4,5) and direction is R, that means on the previous move, it was at (3,5) and moved right to (4,5). Before that, it was at (2,5) and moved to (3,5)? Positions: index 0 is head, index 1 is first body segment, etc.\n\nSo:\n\n- Turn 6: head was at (3,5), and it moved right to (4,5) for turn 7.\n\nBut position list is for turn 7: head (4,5), then (3,5), which is the neck, then (2,5), then (2,6).\n\nThe segment at (2,6) is the tail. So the tail is at (2,6), and before that it was at (2,5) when the snake was shorter or something? Let's think of the path.\n\nAt some point, the snake was at (2,5) and moved down to (2,6), then later, the head moved from (3,5) to (4,5), so the tail moved from (2,5) to (2,6)? No.\n\nWhen the head moves, the body follows, so the last segment is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food was eaten recently, I assume, because length is 4, and positions given.\n\nFrom positions: from head to tail: (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,6)\n\nSo the snake has a bend at (2,5), going from horizontal to vertical down to (2,6).\n\nCurrent head at (4,5), moving right.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,2): x=5,y=2, life=3, value=1\n\n- (5,4): x=5,y=4, life=7, value=1\n\n- (4,2): x=4,y=2, life=10, value=1\n\nAll have value 1, so all positive.\n\nLife span: (5,2) disappears in 3 turns, so by turn 10 it's gone if not eaten.\n\n(5,4) in 7 turns, by turn 14.\n\n(4,2) in 10 turns, by turn 17.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ ahead.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (4,5) with direction R.\n\nSince direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right). Cannot move L (left) because that's opposite direction, and rule says no instant reverse.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move leads to.\n\nIf I move R to (5,5): what is there? No food mentioned, and not a wall. (5,5) is within bounds, x=5<7, y=5<7, not wall. Is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So (5,5) is empty. So safe to move.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6): (4,6) - is it wall? y=6, max y=7, so y=6<7, not wall. Not occupied by body. Food? No food at (4,6), so safe.\n\nIf I move D to (4,4): similarly, y=4>0, not wall, not body, no food, safe.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the food locations and their life spans.\n\nFood at (5,2), (5,4), (4,2).\n\n(5,4) is at y=4, x=5, which is below current head (4,5), so if I go down, I might reach it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is directly below at y=2, same x.\n\n(5,2) is to the right and down.\n\nSince life span of (5,2) is short, only 3 turns, I might prioritize it if possible.\n\nBut I need to ensure I can reach it without dying.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (2,6), which might move.\n\nLet me list the grid coordinates.\n\nI should make a small grid.\n\nLet me sketch a 8x8 grid, but since walls are borders, playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), which is within.\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1) is obstacle.\n\nNow snake:\n\nHead: (4,5)\n\nBody: (3,5)\n\nBody: (2,5)\n\nTail: (2,6)\n\nFood: (5,2), (5,4), (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is at x=4,y=2, which is below, and (3,1) is obstacle nearby.\n\nAlso, tail at (2,6), which is top-left.\n\nNow, for the next move, from (4,5), I can go:\n\n- R to (5,5)\n\n- U to (4,6)\n\n- D to (4,4)\n\nCannot go L to (3,5) because it's occupied by body, and also opposite direction, but since it's body, it's deadly anyway, so not allowed.\n\nNow, let's think about getting food.\n\nFirst, the food at (5,4) is at y=4, which is one step down from (4,5)? (4,5) to (5,4) is not adjacent; (4,5) to (5,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. Moves are only horizontal or vertical, so to reach (5,4), I need to go to (5,5) or (5,3) or (4,4) or (6,4), etc.\n\nSpecifically, from current (4,5), to reach (5,4), I could go down to (4,4), then right to (5,4)? (4,4) to (5,4) is right.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go down to (4,4), then I can go right to (5,4) to eat the food at (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,2) is at (4,2), which is directly below (4,5) but at y=2, so I need to go down multiple steps.\n\nFood at (5,2) at x=5,y=2.\n\nAlso, life span: (5,2) has life=3, meaning it disappears after turn 10? Current turn 7, life span 3, so it disappears at the end of turn 10? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn 7, when we see it, life_span=3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns, meaning after turn 10, it's gone. So it can be eaten on turn 7,8,9,10? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, food has life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1 or at turn t+L?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSuppose at turn t, life_span=N.\n\nAfter turn t, countdown becomes N-1.\n\nIf eaten on turn t, it's consumed.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn t, life_span becomes N-1.\n\nSo it can be eaten as long as life_span >0.\n\nWhen life_span=1, it can be eaten on that turn, and after that turn, it disappears.\n\nFor food at (5,2) at turn 7, life_span=3: it can be eaten on turns 7,8,9. After turn 9, if not eaten, it disappears; so on turn 10, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life=7, can be eaten up to turn 13 (since 7+7-1=13? Turn 7: life=7, can be eaten turn 7 to 13? Let's calculate:\n\n- Turn 7: life=7, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 7, if not eaten, life=6\n\n- Turn 8: life=6, can be eaten\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 13: life=1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 13, disappears, so not on turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life=10, can be eaten up to turn 16.\n\nNow for (5,2), it must be eaten by turn 9, so only 3 turns left: 7,8,9.\n\nBut on turn 7, I'm at (4,5), not adjacent to (5,2), so I can't eat it this turn.\n\nTo eat on turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, other food has more time.\n\nBut I need to think about the path.\n\nAlso, there's a danger about tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because collision.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,6), head at (4,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (4,5) and (2,6) are not adjacent; distance is sqrt(5), not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nNow, let's consider possible actions.\n\nFirst, I could go for the short-life food (5,2).\n\nTo reach (5,2) quickly.\n\nFrom (4,5), I need to go down and right.\n\nIf I go D to (4,4) on turn 7.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go D to (4,3), or R to (5,4), or L to (3,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) has food, so if I go to (5,4) from (4,4), I can eat it on turn 8.\n\nBut (5,4) has longer life, so I don't need to rush it.\n\n(5,2) is more urgent.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I go to (4,3) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go to (4,2) or (5,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\n(4,2) has food, but life long, so I could eat it, but (5,2) is to the right.\n\nFrom (4,3), to reach (5,2), I need to go right and down, but not directly.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go R to (5,3), then on turn 9, from (5,3) to (5,2) to eat.\n\nBut can I do that?\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 8: from (4,4), move D to (4,3)  // assuming I don't eat (5,4) yet\n\nTurn 9: from (4,3), move R to (5,3)\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, so from (5,3), I need to go down to (5,2).\n\nOn turn 10, but (5,2) disappears after turn 9, so I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9 to eat it.\n\nAfter turn 9, it disappears, so must eat on or before turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nIf on turn 7, I move to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move to (4,3)  // now at (4,3)\n\nTurn 9: from (4,3), I can move to (5,3) or (4,2) or (3,3) or (5,2) if possible, but (5,2) is not adjacent to (4,3); adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3). (4,3) to (5,2) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't move directly to (5,2) from (4,3).\n\nSo from (4,3), I can only go to (5,3), (4,2), (3,3), or (4,4) but that's back.\n\nThen from (5,3), on turn 10, I can go to (5,2), but (5,2) is gone by turn 10, since disappears after turn 9.\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,2) by turn 9 if I go through (4,4) and (4,3).\n\nIf on turn 7, I move R to (5,5)\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) or U to (5,6) or L to (4,5) or R to (6,5), etc.\n\n(5,4) has food, so I could eat it on turn 8 by moving D to (5,4).\n\nBut that doesn't help with (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,5), I could go directly down to (5,4), but then for (5,2), I need to go further down.\n\nAfter eating (5,4) on turn 8, I'm at (5,4), then on turn 9, I can go D to (5,3), then on turn 10 to (5,2), but (5,2) gone by turn 10.\n\nStill too late.\n\nTo reach (5,2) by turn 9, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 8.\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,2): (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2)\n\n(5,1): y=1, but walls at y=0, so y=1 is playable? Walls at y=0, so y=1 is not wall, but is it accessible? y=1 is within 1 to 6, should be ok, but let's check obstacles. Internal obstacle at (3,1), but (5,1) is clear.\n\n(5,3), (4,2), (6,2) all possible except (6,2) x=6<7, ok.\n\nSo on turn 8, I need to be at one of these: (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), or (6,2)\n\nNow, from current position (4,5) on turn 7, I need to reach one of these by turn 8.\n\nFrom (4,5), in one move, I can go to (5,5), (4,6), or (4,4)\n\nNone of which are adjacent to (5,2).\n\n(5,5) to (5,2) is not adjacent, distance in y=3.\n\n(4,6) to (5,2) far.\n\n(4,4) to (5,2) not adjacent.\n\nSo from turn 7 position, I cannot be adjacent to (5,2) on turn 8; it's too far.\n\nThe closest I can be on turn 8 is, for example, if I go to (4,4) on turn 7, then to (4,3) on turn 8, but (4,3) is not adjacent to (5,2); adjacent to (5,2) is (4,2), but (4,3) to (4,2) is down, and (4,2) is adjacent to (5,2).\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to (4,2), but not directly to (5,2).\n\nTo be at a cell adjacent to (5,2) on turn 8, I need to be at (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), or (6,2) on turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 7, I can only reach cells adjacent to (4,5): (5,5), (4,6), (4,4)\n\nNone of these are the cells I listed; for example, (4,4) is at y=4, while (4,2) is at y=2, different.\n\nSo it's impossible to be adjacent to (5,2) on turn 8 from current position.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nThe only chance is on turn 9.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 9, head at (5,2).\n\nFor that, on turn 8, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (5,2), so (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), or (6,2)\n\nNow, on turn 7, I am at (4,5), and I move to one of (5,5), (4,6), (4,4)\n\nFrom there, on turn 8, I need to move to one of the adjacent cells to (5,2).\n\nLet's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, suppose on turn 7, I move to (4,4)\n\nThen on turn 8, from (4,4), I can move to (4,3), (4,5), (3,4), (5,4)\n\n(5,4) has food, but let's see.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go to (4,3) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (4,3) on turn 9, I can go to (4,2) or (5,3), but not directly to (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nThen from (5,3) on turn 10, to (5,2), but too late for the food.\n\nIf on turn 8, from (4,4), I go directly to (5,4), which has food, so I eat it, but then I'm at (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (5,4) on turn 9, I can go to (5,3) or (5,5), etc., but not to (5,2) directly; (5,3) is adjacent to (5,2), so on turn 9, from (5,4) to (5,3), then on turn 10 to (5,2), too late.\n\nBut I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo from (5,4) on turn 8, I can only reach (5,3) on turn 9, not (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 7 I go to (5,5)\n\nThen on turn 8, from (5,5), I can go to (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5)\n\nIf I go to (5,4), eat food, then on turn 9 at (5,4), can go to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10 to (5,2), late.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,3) from (5,5)? From (5,5) to (5,3) is not adjacent, I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (5,5) I can go to (5,4) or (5,6), etc., not directly to (5,3).\n\nSo the only way to reach (5,2) by turn 9 is if on turn 8 I am at (5,3) or (4,2) or (5,1) or (6,2)\n\nBut from turn 7, the only cells I can be on turn 8 are (5,5), (4,6), (4,4), none of which can reach those in one move except possibly (4,4) to (4,3) or (5,4), but (4,3) is not adjacent to (5,2), (5,4) is not adjacent to (5,2).\n\n(5,4) to (5,2) is two steps down, not adjacent.\n\n(4,4) to (4,2) is two steps down, not direct.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (5,2) by turn 9 from current position, because the Manhattan distance is |5-4| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4, and in two moves (turn 8 and 9), I can cover distance 2, but the food is at distance 3 in Manhattan terms? From (4,5) to (5,2), delta x=1, delta y=3, so Manhattan distance 4.\n\nIn one move (turn 7), I can reduce distance by at most 1, to say (4,4) or (5,5), distance to (5,2) from (4,4) is |5-4| + |2-4| =1+2=3, from (5,5) is |5-5| + |2-5| =0+3=3.\n\nThen on turn 8, from there, I can reduce to min distance 2, e.g., from (5,5) to (5,4) distance to (5,2) is 2, or from (4,4) to (4,3) distance 3? From (4,4) to (5,2) is |5-4| + |2-4| =1+2=3, to (4,3) is |5-4| + |2-3| =1+1=2? (4,3) to (5,2) is |5-4| + |2-3| =1+1=2, not adjacent.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (4,3) I can go to (4,2) or (5,3), both distance 1 to (5,2), so I can go to (5,2) on turn 9 only if I am at (4,2) or (5,3) on turn 9? No.\n\nOn turn 9, I need to be at (5,2).\n\nTo be at (5,2) on turn 9, I must come from an adjacent cell on turn 8, so on turn 8 I must be at (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), or (6,2).\n\nNow, on turn 8, where can I be based on turn 7 move.\n\nIf on turn 7 I go to (4,4), then on turn 8 from (4,4) I can be at (4,3), (4,5), (3,4), (5,4)\n\nNone of these are (5,3) or (4,2) or etc.\n\n(4,3) is one, but (4,3) is not in the list; the list for turn 8 is (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2)\n\n(4,3) is not adjacent to (5,2); it is at distance 2.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5) on turn 8, I can be at (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5), none of which are the required cells.\n\n(5,4) is not adjacent to (5,2).\n\nSo indeed, it is impossible to reach (5,2) by turn 9 from current position. The earliest I can reach (5,2) is turn 10, but it disappears after turn 9, so I cannot eat (5,2) at all. It will disappear without being eaten.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore (5,2) and focus on other food.\n\nNow, other food: (5,4) and (4,2), both with longer life.\n\n(5,4) can be eaten up to turn 13, (4,2) up to turn 16.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, current position (4,5), head direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), that might be a good central position.\n\nIf I go D to (4,4), closer to the food below.\n\nIf I go U to (4,6), away from food.\n\nSince (4,2) is below, going down might be better.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), which is down and right.\n\nAlso, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1), but that's far, at y=1.\n\nNow, the tail is at (2,6), which might be a problem if I go left, but I can't go left directly.\n\nLet's think about the snake's body.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nWhen I move, the head moves, and the body follows, so if I don't eat food, the tail moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move to (5,5) on turn 7, then the new positions: head at (5,5), then the body segments: previous head (4,5) becomes body, so body at (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,5), and tail (2,6) is removed since no food eaten, so tail is now at (2,5)? Let's see.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, the last segment (tail) is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSo after move to (5,5), snake positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), body (3,5), body (2,5), and (2,6) is gone. So tail at (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (4,4), head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6) gone, so body (2,5) but (2,5) is still there, positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,5), so tail at (2,5).\n\n(2,6) is removed.\n\nNow, (2,5) is now the tail.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nNow, to eat food, for example, (5,4) is at (5,4), which is below (5,5) or left of (6,4), etc.\n\nFrom current, if I go to (5,5) on turn 7, then on turn 8 I can go down to (5,4) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is at (4,2), I can go down step by step.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n\nAlso, the grid has walls, so I need to not hit walls or body.\n\nLet's consider the map.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,1) is obstacle.\n\nSo cells like (3,1) cannot be entered.\n\nNow, let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, since (5,4) is close, I might eat it soon.\n\nBut eating food increases length, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nCurrent length 4.\n\nIf I eat (5,4), length becomes 5.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut all food positive, so eating is good for score.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nNow, the tail is at (2,5) or (2,6) depending on move, but it will move.\n\nFor example, if I move to (5,5) on turn 7, tail at (2,5).\n\nThen if I go to (5,4) on turn 8, eat food, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nAfter eating, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 7: move to (5,5), no food, so snake: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // (2,6) gone, tail at (2,5)\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,4), which has food, so eat it, head to (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) remains because food eaten, so new positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // length 5\n\nTail at (2,5)\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), so I can go left or down.\n\nBut y=2, x=4.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go L to (4,4), or D to (5,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut there's time.\n\nAnother food is (4,2), which is at same x as start, but lower y.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,1) might block paths to the bottom-left.\n\nBut (4,2) is at x=4,y=2, and (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is adjacent diagonally, but not directly blocking.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move to (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2), but (3,2) might be affected by obstacle, but (3,2) is clear, only (3,1) is obstacle.\n\n(3,2) is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is playable, y=1>0.\n\nNow, back to current turn.\n\nI need to choose turn 7 action.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move R to (5,5): then I can eat (5,4) on turn 8 easily.\n\n- Move D to (4,4): then I can go to (4,3) or to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nIf I go to (4,4), and then to (5,4) on turn 8, same as above.\n\nBut from (4,4), I could go down to (4,3) to reach (4,2) faster.\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, so from (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2), I can eat (4,2) on turn 9 if I go down twice.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)\n\nNo food at (4,4), so snake: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail (2,6) gone, tail at (2,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3), no food, so head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) gone? After move, head to (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5) removed, so tail at (3,5)\n\nPositions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nThen turn 9: move D to (4,2), which has food, so eat it, head to (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (3,5) remains, so new segment, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // length 5\n\nTail at (3,5)\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nIf I go to (5,5) first, then to (5,4), I eat (5,4) earlier but (4,2) later.\n\nBut (4,2) has longer life, so no rush.\n\n(5,4) life 7, (4,2) life 10, both long.\n\nBut I need to consider the area.\n\nThe bottom-left has the obstacle, so moving to (4,2) might be riskier if I get trapped.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), I can go to (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2)\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to obstacle (3,1), so might be tight.\n\n(4,1) is bottom row.\n\nWhereas (5,4) is more central.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving.\n\nIn the first scenario, if I go to (5,5) then (5,4), I have a longer snake, but tail at (2,5) which is left.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to (5,3) or (4,4) etc.\n\nTo reach (4,2), from (5,4), I can go left to (4,4), then down to (4,3), then to (4,2), but that takes more turns.\n\nTurn 8 at (5,4), turn 9 to (4,4) or (5,3), turn 10 to (4,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) gone, etc.\n\nBut (4,2) can be eaten later.\n\nNow, another thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently not an issue.\n\nBut in the future, if tail has food and head adjacent, but food is on cells, not on tail unless it spawns there.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here the food positions are given, and none are under snake now.\n\nSnake is at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), food at (5,2), (5,4), (4,2), none under snake.\n\n(4,2) is under? (4,2) is not occupied by snake; snake is at y=5 and 6, (4,2) is y=2, so not under.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I should avoid dead ends.\n\nThe area around (3,1) might be tricky.\n\nFor example, cells like (3,1) blocked, (3,2), (4,1), (2,1), etc., but (2,1) might be accessible.\n\nBut let's not go there unnecessarily.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1, which is 7, for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to specify actions for turn 7,8,9,... but how many? The format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut I can decide based on situation, but since the state might change, I need to plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a sequence that gets food and avoids risks.\n\nFirst, let's aim to eat (5,4) since it's close.\n\nThen go for (4,2) later.\n\nBut (4,2) is also close if I go down now.\n\nLet's compare.\n\nIf I go down to (4,4) on turn 7, then to (4,3) on turn 8, then to (4,2) on turn 9 to eat it.\n\nThen I have eaten (4,2) on turn 9.\n\nIf I go right to (5,5) on turn 7, then to (5,4) on turn 8 to eat it, then I need to go to (4,2) which takes more time, say on turn 9 to (5,3) or (4,4), turn 10 to (4,3), turn 11 to (4,2), so later.\n\nBut since (4,2) has long life, it's fine.\n\nBut eating sooner might be better to free up space or something, but not necessary.\n\nScore-wise, eating any food gives +1, so I can eat both, order doesn't matter for score, but for survival, I need to not die.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake grows, so I need more space.\n\nCurrent grid, with snake and food.\n\nAlso, after moves, the tail moves, so areas open up.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,4) on turn 7, no eat, tail moves to (2,5), then to (4,3) on turn 8, no eat, tail moves to (3,5) or something.\n\nIn the down path to (4,2):\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4)  // positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail (2,6) gone\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3)  // head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail (2,5) gone\n\nTurn 9: move D to (4,2)  // eat food, so head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // length 5, tail at (3,5)\n\nNow at (4,2), I can move to (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2) but (5,2) gone, or (5,2) is gone by turn 9, so not there.\n\n(4,3) is body, so cannot go there.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, deadly, so cannot.\n\nL to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) gone, or if not, but it is gone, D to (4,1)\n\n(4,1) is y=1, not wall, and no obstacle, so can go D to (4,1)\n\nOr L to (3,2), or R to (5,2) but cell (5,2) no longer has food, and is empty, so can go there.\n\nBut (5,2) is empty now.\n\nSo from (4,2), I can go to (4,1), (3,2), or (5,2)\n\nNow, (3,2) is near the obstacle (3,1), so might be tight.\n\n(4,1) is bottom row.\n\n(5,2) is open.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten (5,4) first, I would be at (5,4) with longer snake, and can go to (5,3) or (4,4) etc.\n\nBut in the down path, after eating (4,2) at turn 9, I am at (4,2) with body above, so I might be constrained.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,2) on turn 10, then to (5,3) or (6,2), etc.\n\nBut let's see the other option.\n\nIf I go to (5,5) on turn 7:\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)  // head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)  // eat food, head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // length 5, tail at (2,5)\n\nNow at (5,4), I can move to (5,3), (5,5) but (5,5) is body, deadly, so cannot, or L to (4,4), R to (6,4), U to (5,5) no, D to (5,3)\n\nSo possible: L to (4,4), D to (5,3), R to (6,4)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,2) eventually.\n\nFor example, turn 9: move L to (4,4)  // no food, so head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail (2,5) gone, so body (3,5) is tail? Positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (4,3)  // head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail (3,5) gone\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2)  // eat food, head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)? Let's see: after move to (4,2) with eat, so new head, body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), but (4,5) is the last, tail.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and (4,5) since food eaten, tail stays, so length 6.\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nThen from (4,2), same as before.\n\nBut it took longer to eat (4,2).\n\nIn the first path, I ate (4,2) on turn 9, in this path on turn 11.\n\nBut I ate (5,4) on turn 8 in this path.\n\nSo net, in first path, by turn 9 I have eaten one food (4,2), in second path by turn 8 I have eaten one food (5,4), and by turn 11 another.\n\nBut since both are to be eaten, it's similar, but eating earlier might be better for score accumulation, but score is per food, so as long as I eat both, it's fine.\n\nBut for survival, the first path might have risk at (4,2).\n\nIn the first path, after eating (4,2) on turn 9, I am at (4,2) with body at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), so the cells above are occupied, so I must move to (4,1), (3,2), or (5,2).\n\n(4,1) is bottom, (3,2) is near obstacle, (5,2) is open.\n\nIf I go to (5,2), then I can go up or right.\n\nBut (5,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, in the second path, after eating (5,4), I have more space.\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle.\n\nThe obstacle at (3,1) means that from (3,2), I can only go to (2,2), (3,3), (4,2), but not to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) can go to (4,2), (5,1), (3,1) but (3,1) obstacle, so only (4,2), (5,1), and (4,0) wall, so only two directions if at corner.\n\n(4,1) is at y=1, x=4, so adjacent cells: (4,0) wall, (4,2), (3,1) obstacle, (5,1)\n\nSo only two moves: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1)\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) : (3,1) obstacle, (3,3), (2,2), (4,2)\n\nSo three moves.\n\nNot too bad.\n\nBut to avoid risks, perhaps I should not go to the bottom row unnecessarily.\n\nTherefore, going for (5,4) first might be better, as it's more central.\n\nThen I can go for (4,2) later when the tail has moved, opening space.\n\nIn the second path, after turn 8, tail is at (2,5), which is left, and I can move down to reach (4,2).\n\nBut let's decide on a sequence.\n\nSince the answer needs actions, I should provide for turn 7,8,9,10,11 or so.\n\nBut I can start with turn 7.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction.\n\nWhen I move, the direction changes.\n\nFor example, if I move D from (4,5), direction becomes D.\n\nThen next move, I cannot go U, instant reverse.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn planning, I need to consider that.\n\nFor now, let's go for the central approach.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 8: move D to (5,4) to eat the food there.\n\nThen after that, I need to go towards (4,2).\n\nFrom (5,4), on turn 9, I can move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3) or R to (6,4)\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), so going left or down is better.\n\nIf I go L to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2).\n\nBut on turn 9, from (5,4), move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 10: from (4,4) move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: from (4,3) move D to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 11, (4,2) life span: at turn 7, life=10, so on turn 11, life=10 - (11-7) = 10-4=6, still there, yes.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down from (5,4) to (5,3) on turn 9, then to (5,2) but (5,2) gone, or to (4,3) etc., but to reach (4,2), I need to go left.\n\nSo similar.\n\nBut from (5,4), going directly to (4,4) might be fine.\n\nThen to (4,3), then (4,2).\n\nBut when I go to (4,2), as before, I have the body above.\n\nBut since I came from (4,3), and body is behind, it might be ok.\n\nTo avoid the bottom, after eating (5,4), I could go to (5,3) then to (4,3) etc.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nI think going for (5,4) first is reasonable.\n\nThen for turn 7, move R to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 8, move D to (5,4) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 9, move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 10, move D to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 11, move D to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 11, when I move to (4,2), I eat, so length increases.\n\nBefore that, on turn 10, at (4,3), what is around.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAfter turn 8, I have a longer snake, tail at (2,5), which is left.\n\nWhen I move to (4,4) on turn 9, no eat, so tail moves.\n\nLet's simulate the positions.\n\nStart turn 7: snake: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] head dir R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)\n\nNo food, so new positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // (2,6) removed, tail at (2,5)\n\nDirection now R? After moving right, direction is R.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)  // (5,4) has food, eat it, so head to (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail (2,5) remains, new length 5, positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nDirection now D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4)  // (4,4) no food, so head to (4,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail (2,5) removed, so positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)\n\nDirection L (left).\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,3)  // no food, head to (4,3), body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail (3,5) removed, positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail at (4,5)? Body segments: after head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) so tail at (4,5)\n\nDirection D (down).\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2)  // (4,2) has food, eat, so head to (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // and new segment, tail remains, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // length 6\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow at (4,2), I can move to (4,1), (3,2), or (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is empty, (3,2) is empty, (4,1) empty.\n\nAll possible.\n\nBut to avoid the bottom, I can go to (5,2) or (3,2).\n\nFor example, to (5,2) on turn 12.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or right.\n\nThe snake is now longer, so I need to navigate carefully.\n\nBut since I have eaten both foods, I can just move around safely.\n\nBut for now, this sequence seems ok.\n\nI could have eaten (4,2) first, but with potential risk.\n\nAnother option: on turn 7, go D to (4,4), then turn 8 go to (5,4) to eat, same as above but from different start.\n\nIf turn 7: move D to (4,4)\n\nNo food, positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail (2,6) gone\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4)  // eat food, head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // length 5, tail at (2,5)\n\nThen same as after turn 8 in previous, but at (5,4) with direction R or D? Moved right to (5,4), so direction R.\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (4,4)  // but (4,4) is body? Positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n(4,4) is body, so if I move L to (4,4), it's collision, deadly.\n\nOh! Important point.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (5,4) on turn 8, body includes (4,4), so I cannot move left to (4,4) because it's occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly, in the first sequence, when I moved to (5,4) from above, the body was (5,5), (4,5), etc., not (4,4).\n\nIn the first sequence, after turn 8: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), so (4,4) is empty.\n\nThen I can move to (4,4).\n\nBut in this alternative, if I go to (4,4) first on turn 7, then to (5,4) on turn 8, after moving to (4,4), the body includes (4,5), so when I move to (5,4), the new body has (4,4), (4,5), etc., so (4,4) is occupied.\n\nThen from (5,4), I cannot move left to (4,4) because it's body.\n\nI can only move to (5,3), (5,5) but (5,5) may not be body, or (6,4).\n\nIn this case, from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3) or right to (6,4), or up to (5,5) if not body.\n\nIn positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), so (5,5) is empty? Yes, not occupied.\n\nSo I can go to (5,5), but that might be backtracking.\n\nOr to (5,3) or (6,4).\n\nTo reach (4,2), I need to go left, but cannot directly, so I might go down to (5,3), then to (4,3) or (5,2), etc., which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 9: move D to (5,3)  // no food, head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail (2,5) gone\n\nThen turn 10: move L to (4,3)  // head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)  // tail (3,5) gone\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2)  // eat, etc.\n\nBut longer path.\n\nTherefore, it's better to go to (5,5) first, then down to (5,4), so that (4,4) is free to move later.\n\nSo the first sequence is better.\n\nThus, for turn 7, move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 8, move D to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 9, move L to (4,4)\n\nThen I need to go to (4,3) and (4,2).\n\nBut from (4,4), on turn 9, I move to (4,4), but in the sequence, on turn 9 I move to (4,4), which is from (5,4) left.\n\nThen on turn 10, I can move down to (4,3)\n\nBut (4,3) might be occupied? No, in simulation, on turn 9: after moving to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) // from earlier\n\n(4,3) is empty.\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (4,3), no food, positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (4,2), eat food.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to provide actions starting from turn 7.\n\nBut how many turns? The format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can provide for 5 turns: turn 7 to 11.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions for 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nBut on turn 11, I eat (4,2), so it's fine.\n\nI could stop after turn 10 or something, but since I planned to turn 11, it's ok.\n\nTo be safe, I should ensure no collision.\n\nFor example, on turn 10, at (4,3), moving to (4,2), which is food, so no issue.\n\nBut after that, I need to move away, but for the sequence, it's up to turn 11.\n\nPerhaps I can provide fewer, but I think 5 actions are fine.\n\nNow, about the food life: (4,2) is eaten on turn 11, and at turn 7 life=10, so on turn 11, life=10 - (11-7) =10-4=6>0, ok.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nIs there a way to eat both faster? Probably not, since they are not on the way.\n\nAnother path: after eating (5,4), go directly to (4,2) but not straight, so same.\n\nSo I think this is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 9 I move L to (4,4), which is fine.\n\nDirection: after turn 7 move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 8 move D, direction down.\n\nTurn 9 move L, direction left.\n\nTurn 10 move D, direction down.\n\nTurn 11 move D, direction down, but (4,2) to (4,1) if I continue, but I don't need to.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,1) is not in the way for this path.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves 5 turns ahead (turns 7 to 11). The plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (5,4) first, as it is closer and has a moderate life span (7 turns remaining), and then proceeds to eat the food at (4,2), which has a longer life span (10 turns remaining). The food at (5,2) is ignored because it cannot be reached before it disappears after turn 9 (life span 3 at turn 7).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 7)**:\n  - Snake head at (4,5), direction right (R).\n  - Snake body: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)].\n  - Food: (5,4) at distance 1 (Manhattan), can be eaten by turn 8; (4,2) at distance 3, can be eaten by turn 11.\n  - (5,2) is unreachable by turn 9 (disappears after turn 9), so it is skipped.\n- **Movement Constraints**:\n  - From (4,5), allowed moves: U (up to (4,6)), D (down to (4,4)), R (right to (5,5))—no L (left) due to opposite direction and body collision risk.\n  - After each move, direction updates to the new movement direction.\n- **Food and Survival**:\n  - Eating (5,4) on turn 8 increases snake length to 5, requiring careful pathing to avoid trapping.\n  - Eating (4,2) on turn 11 is safe due to its long life span (still available on turn 11 with life span 6).\n  - The sequence avoids the bottom-left area near the obstacle (3,1) to reduce collision risks.\n  - Tail reward danger is not a concern, as no food is under the tail or adjacent to the head.\n- **5-Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 7**: Move R to (5,5)—central position, sets up for (5,4).\n  - **Turn 8**: Move D to (5,4)—eat (5,4), score +1, length increases to 5.\n  - **Turn 9**: Move L to (4,4)—positions for descent to (4,2).\n  - **Turn 10**: Move D to (4,3)—intermediate step.\n  - **Turn 11**: Move D to (4,2)—eat (4,2), score +1, length increases to 6.\n- **Path Safety**:\n  - No wall collisions: all moves stay within x=1-6, y=1-6.\n  - No body collisions: movements avoid occupied cells (simulated positions below).\n  - After turn 11, the snake can safely navigate to open areas (e.g., move to (5,2) or (3,2)).\n\n### Simulated Positions (for verification):\n- **Turn 7 (after move)**: Head at (5,5), body: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] (tail (2,6) removed).\n- **Turn 8 (after move and eat)**: Head at (5,4), body: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] (length 5, tail at (2,5)).\n- **Turn 9 (after move)**: Head at (4,4), body: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] (tail (2,5) removed).\n- **Turn 10 (after move)**: Head at (4,3), body: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] (tail (3,5) removed).\n- **Turn 11 (after move and eat)**: Head at (4,2), body: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] (length 6, tail at (4,5)).\n\nThis plan scores 2 points by turn 11 and maintains a safe path for continued survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: R (right)\nTurn 8: D (down)\nTurn 9: L (left)\nTurn 10: D (down)\nTurn 11: D (down)\n}",

That means the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's 8 units wide and 8 high. Coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nCurrent turn is t=8.\n\nWalls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head at (5,5), then body at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is horizontal, moving right, since head direction is R. Head is at (5,5), next is (4,5), so it's moving east, to the right.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,2) with life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (5,4) with life_span=6, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (4,2) with life_span=9, value=1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so no negative food here. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n\nLife_span: For (5,2), life_span=2 at turn 8, so it will disappear after 2 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 10. Since life_span decreases every turn including current, at turn 8, it has 2 turns left, so it disappears at the start of turn 10? Let me clarify the life_span countdown.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + N. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, it has N turns left, including turn t. After turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until turn t + N -1 it has 1 left, and then at turn t + N, it's gone.\n\nFor (5,2): at turn 8, life_span=2, so it has 2 turns left: it will be there on turn 8 and 9, gone on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): life_span=6 at turn 8, so it will be there until turn 13 (since 8+6-1=13? Let's calculate properly.\n\nAt turn t, with life_span N, it disappears after N turns, so available from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n\nExample: if N=1 at turn t, it disappears after 1 turn, so only on turn t, gone on turn t+1.\n\nIf N=2 at turn t, available on turn t and t+1, gone on turn t+2.\n\nSo for (5,2): N=2 at t=8, available on turn 8 and 9, gone on turn 10.\n\n(5,4): N=6 at t=8, available from turn 8 to 13 (8+5=13? 8 to 8+6-1=13, yes turn 13 included? Turns: t=8,9,10,11,12,13, that's 6 turns, gone on turn 14.\n\nt to t+N-1 inclusive is N turns.\n\nt=8, N=6, available turns: 8,9,10,11,12,13 — that's 6 turns, gone at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2): N=9, available from turn 8 to 16, gone at turn 17.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,5), direction R (right). So possible moves: since direction is R, I can move R (right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left next turn. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is death. Also internal obstacle at (3,1), but that's not near the snake right now.\n\nSnake positions: (5,5) head, (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So body occupies (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). Head is at (5,5), so if I move right to (6,5), that should be fine, since (6,5) is within bounds? x=6, y=5, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok, since walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=5 between 0 and 7.\n\nSimilarly, move up to (5,6) or down to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) has food! Let's see.\n\nFood at (5,4), which is directly below the head. Head at (5,5), down to (5,4).\n\nBut moving to (5,4) would eat the food there, since it's positive food.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's food at (5,2) and (4,2), but (5,2) has short life, only 2 turns left.\n\nFirst, let's list the current state:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n- Direction: R\n\nPossible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U: to (5,6)\n\n- D: to (5,4) — has food!\n\n- R: to (6,5)\n\nCannot L to (4,5) because that's the body, but (4,5) is occupied by the first body segment. Moving to (4,5) would cause collision, since head touches body.\n\nThe rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, the tail is at (2,5). If I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it might be ok, but only if it's the tail.\n\nCurrently, body segments: (4,5) is the neck, then (3,5), (2,5) is the tail.\n\nIf I move to (2,5), that would be the tail, and since the tail moves when I move, it might be safe? Let's see.\n\nIf I move left to (4,5), but (4,5) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail. The tail is (2,5). So moving to (4,5) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (3,5) or (2,5) directly is not possible except for the tail cell under specific conditions.\n\nBut in this case, from (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is impossible because (4,5) is occupied and not the tail. Also, instant reverse is not allowed since direction is R, cannot go L.\n\nSo only U, D, R are possible.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each move for turn 8.\n\nFirst, move D: to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) has food with value +1. So if I move there, I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (5,4), and tail stays, so new positions: head (5,4), then the previous head (5,5) becomes body, so snake becomes [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] but since I ate food, length increases, so the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — so five segments now.\n\nOriginal: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — four segments.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to (5,4), and since food is eaten, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, so new body: (5,5) becomes first body segment, then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) remains, so snake is [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] with length 5.\n\nDirection after move: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n\nNow, is this safe? (5,4) was occupied by food, not body, so no collision. Walls: y=4 is fine, x=5 fine.\n\nBut after this move, what about the food at (5,4)? It's eaten, so it disappears.\n\nNow, other moves: move U to (5,6): no food there, so snake moves, head to (5,6), tail moves forward, so new positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (2,5) is gone, so snake length 4 still.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (6,5): no food, head to (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail gone, length 4.\n\nBut (6,5) is within bounds, x=6, y=5, walls at x=7, so ok.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,2) has only 2 turns left: available turn 8 and 9, gone turn 10.\n\nSince it's turn 8 now, I might want to eat it soon.\n\nBut to eat (5,2), I need to move down to (5,4) first, then to (5,3) or something.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, if I move down to (5,4) on turn 8, I eat the food there.\n\nThen on turn 9, head at (5,4), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: since direction D, I can move D (down), L (left), R (right), but not U (up), instant reverse.\n\nDown to (5,3), left to (4,4), right to (6,4).\n\nNow, (5,3) has no food, I think, only food at (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n\n(5,3) is empty, I assume.\n\nIf I move down to (5,3) on turn 9, then head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 10, I can move down to (5,2), which has food, and it should be available turn 10? (5,2) life_span=2 at turn 8, so available turn 8 and 9. Turn 9 is the last chance, gone on turn 10.\n\nAt turn 8, (5,2) is available.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) on turn 8, I eat that food, but (5,2) is still there for turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, if I am at (5,4), I can move down to (5,3), but (5,2) is at (5,2), so from (5,3) I can move down to (5,2) on turn 10, but on turn 10, (5,2) is gone! Because it disappears after turn 9.\n\nTurn 8: (5,2) available\n\nTurn 9: available (since life_span=2, turns 8 and 9)\n\nTurn 10: gone\n\nSo to eat (5,2), I must be on (5,2) on turn 9 or earlier.\n\nOn turn 8, head at (5,5), I can move down to (5,4) or directly? To (5,2)? No, I can only move one step.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move U, D, R.\n\nD to (5,4) or U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nTo reach (5,2), I need to go down twice.\n\nBut on turn 8, I can move to (5,4), which is down.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (5,4), I can move down to (5,3) or to (5,2)? (5,2) is two steps down from (5,4)? No, from (5,4) to (5,3) is down, then to (5,2) is another down.\n\nBut on turn 9, if I move to (5,3), I can move to (5,2) on turn 10, but (5,2) is gone on turn 10, so I miss it.\n\nIf on turn 9, from (5,4), I move directly to (5,2)? But I can only move to adjacent cells, so (5,2) is not adjacent to (5,4); (5,4) to (5,3) is adjacent, (5,3) to (5,2) is adjacent.\n\nSo I need to be at (5,3) on turn 9 to move to (5,2) on turn 10, but (5,2) gone turn 10.\n\nTherefore, the only way to eat (5,2) is on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) or adjacent to move to it.\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,2) are: (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2).\n\n(5,1) is y=1, walls at y=0, so y=1 is ok? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is within bounds.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are safe? Grid from y=0 to y=7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 or x=7 are walls.\n\nSo (5,1) is x=5, y=1, which is not wall, since walls are only at y=0 and y=7, etc.\n\ny=1 is not y=0, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) and (6,2) are safe.\n\nNow, on turn 9, to eat (5,2), I need to move to it from one of these adjacent cells.\n\nBut on turn 8, I am at (5,5).\n\nTo be at an adjacent cell to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nFor example, if I move down on turn 8 to (5,4), then on turn 9 I am at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (5,2); (5,4) to (5,2) is not adjacent, distance 2.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move down to (5,3) on turn 9, but (5,3) is adjacent to (5,2), so on turn 10 I could move to (5,2), but (5,2) gone turn 10, so no.\n\nIf on turn 8, I move directly towards (5,2), but from (5,5), I can only move to (5,4) down, or other.\n\nAnother option: move right to (6,5) on turn 8, but that takes me away.\n\nOr up to (5,6), away.\n\nSo from current position, I cannot reach (5,2) on turn 9 directly because it's two moves away.\n\nThe closest I can be on turn 9 to (5,2) is (5,3) or (4,2) or (5,4) etc.\n\nBut to be at (5,3) on turn 9, I need to be at (5,4) on turn 8 and move down on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 8, I can move to (5,4), then on turn 9 to (5,3), then on turn 10 to (5,2) but food gone.\n\nTo be at (4,2) on turn 9: (4,2) has food, but let's see how to get there.\n\nFrom (5,5), move left? But I cannot move left, because direction is R, and instant reverse not allowed, and (4,5) is body, so cannot.\n\nMove down to (5,4) on turn 8, then on turn 9 from (5,4), I can move left to (4,4), or down to (5,3), etc.\n\n(4,4) is empty, I think.\n\nThen from (4,4), on turn 10, I can move down to (4,3), then to (4,2) on turn 11, but (4,2) has life_span 9, so available until turn 16, no problem.\n\nBut for (5,2), it's impossible to eat because I can't reach it on turn 9 with the current position.\n\nLet's confirm the turns:\n\nTurn 8: current, head at (5,5)\n\nIf I move down to (5,4) on turn 8, I eat (5,4) food.\n\nThen turn 9: head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nI can move down to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\n(5,3) has no food, I assume.\n\nThen turn 10: head at (5,3), move down to (5,2), but (5,2) is gone, so no food, just move to empty cell.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 9 from (5,4), I move left to (4,4), then turn 10 to (4,3), turn 11 to (4,2), eat (4,2) food.\n\nBut (4,2) has long life, so ok.\n\nBut (5,2) will disappear uneaten, which is fine, since it's only +1, and I have other food.\n\nNow, there's also the food at (5,4) which I can eat on turn 8 if I move down.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival and other risks.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, which might cause issues later.\n\nFor example, if I eat (5,4) on turn 8, snake becomes longer, positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow, on turn 9, if I move down to (5,3), then positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5) now, since (2,5) moved? When I move, the tail moves forward only if I don't eat food.\n\nWhen I move to a new cell without food, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n\nBut when I eat, the tail stays.\n\nIn this case, after eating on turn 8, snake is at [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nOn turn 9, if I move to (5,3) without eating, then new head (5,3), and tail moves, so the (2,5) is removed, new positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] — tail at (3,5).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nNow, the food at (4,2) is at (4,2), which is two left and two down from (5,5).\n\nI could go for that.\n\nBut let's consider not eating (5,4) now, to save it or something, but food doesn't respawn, I think, so better to eat it if possible.\n\nThe problem doesn't say new food spawns, so only these foods for now.\n\nBut food might spawn later? No, the state has only these foods, and no mention of new food, so I think these are the only ones.\n\nSo I need to eat them before they disappear or avoid if negative, but all positive.\n\n(5,2) will disappear soon, but I can't eat it, so I should ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) I can eat now by moving down.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nIf I move right to (6,5) on turn 8, no food, so snake moves, head to (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5), length 4.\n\nThen I can go down or left or up.\n\nBut (5,4) is below, I could go down to (6,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), which is left and down from (6,5).\n\nFrom (6,5), direction R (since I moved right, new direction R).\n\nOn turn 9, I can move down to (6,4), or left to (5,5), but (5,5) is now body? After moving to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — so (5,5) is body, so I cannot move left to (5,5) because it's occupied and not tail.\n\nTail is at (3,5).\n\nSo from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), R to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so R to (7,5) is invalid, collision.\n\nx=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n\nL to (5,5) is body, not possible.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is y=6, not wall, (6,4) not wall.\n\nIf I move D to (6,4), then I am at (6,4), which is not food.\n\nThen I can go to (5,4) from there, but (5,4) is at (5,4), adjacent to (6,4), so on turn 10, from (6,4) I can move left to (5,4) to eat it, but (5,4) has life_span 6, so available until turn 13, so on turn 10 it's still there.\n\nBut if I do that, I miss eating (5,4) on turn 8, but I can eat it later.\n\nBut by moving right, I don't eat food now, snake doesn't grow, but I might have more flexibility.\n\nBut growing is good for score.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (5,6) on turn 8, no food, then I am at (5,6), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 9, I can move U to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid, or D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body? After moving to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — so (5,5) is body, cannot move down to it.\n\nL to (4,6), or R to (6,6).\n\n(4,6) and (6,6) are empty, I think.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves: L to (4,6), R to (6,6), or U not possible, D not possible.\n\nThen I can go down later, but I am farther from the foods.\n\nSo moving up seems worse, takes me away from the food cluster at y=2-4.\n\nFoods at (5,2), (5,4), (4,2), all at lower y.\n\nSo moving down or right might be better.\n\nBut moving right to (6,5) then down to (6,4) then left to (5,4) to eat on turn 10, for example.\n\nBut that delays eating.\n\nWhereas moving down now eats immediately.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4) on turn 8, snake is at [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow, the head is at (5,4), and tail is at (2,5), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nIf I move to (5,3) on turn 9, head at (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is not adjacent to (5,3), so ok.\n\nThen I can move to (5,2) on turn 10, but food gone, or to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut (5,2) gone, so I can go to (4,2) eventually.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), which is left and down.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move left to (4,3) on turn 10, then down to (4,2) on turn 11 to eat.\n\n(4,2) has life_span 9, so on turn 11 it's still available.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (5,4) now, I can eat it later.\n\nBut there's another food at (4,2) with long life.\n\nBut let's consider the internal obstacle at (3,1). It might block paths.\n\n(3,1) is below, but not directly in the way yet.\n\nAlso, walls at borders.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat as much as possible, but avoid dying.\n\nSince (5,2) is expiring soon and I can't eat it, I should focus on other foods.\n\n(5,4) can be eaten now or later.\n\nBut if I eat it now, I grow, which might be good, but I need to have space.\n\nThe grid is 8x8, snake length 4, after eating 5, still small.\n\nBut with walls and obstacle, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (5,4), then to (5,3), then to (5,2) but food gone, then I am at (5,2), which is near the bottom.\n\ny=2, walls at y=0.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move to (4,2) or (6,2) or up to (5,3), etc.\n\n(4,2) has food, so I can eat it from there.\n\nBut from (5,2), (4,2) is adjacent, so I can move directly to eat (4,2) if I am at (5,2).\n\nBut to be at (5,2) on turn 10, for example.\n\nBut (5,2) gone on turn 10, so on turn 10, (5,2) is not there, so (5,2) is empty or gone.\n\nOn turn 10, (5,2) is not there, so if I move to (5,2) on turn 10, no food, just empty cell.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (4,2) on turn 11 to eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's outline possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Move down on turn 8 to (5,4), eat food, score +1, length 5.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), move down to (5,3), no food, head to (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3), move down to (5,2), but no food (since gone), head to (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — tail at (4,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow at (5,2), I can move to (4,2) on turn 11 to eat the food there, or to (5,1) or (6,2), etc.\n\n(4,2) has food, so move left to (4,2) on turn 11.\n\nFrom (5,2), moving left to (4,2) is possible, direction from D to L, not instant reverse.\n\nThen eat (4,2), grow to length 6.\n\nThen from there, I need to find new paths.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother option: from turn 8, move right to (6,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,5), move down to (6,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,4), move left to (5,4), which has food, eat it, grow.\n\nBut on turn 10, (5,4) is still available? Life_span 6 from turn 8, so turn 8 to 13 available, so yes.\n\nSo sequence: turn 8: R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 10: L to (5,4) eat food.\n\nScore +1 on turn 10.\n\nCompared to eating on turn 8 in first option, I get the score later, but same +1.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 8 and 9, I didn't grow, snake length still 4, so I might have missed opportunity to eat other food, but no other food nearby.\n\n(5,2) is expiring, but I can't eat it anyway.\n\nIn this path, by turn 10, I eat (5,4), but (5,2) is gone.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to (4,2) as before.\n\nBut in this case, I delayed eating by two turns.\n\nSince the score is the same, but I might be able to eat multiple foods.\n\nAnother option: move down on turn 8 to eat (5,4), then on turn 9 instead of going down, go left to (4,4) or something to go towards (4,2).\n\nFor example, turn 8: D to (5,4) eat, length 5.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), move left to (4,4), no food, head to (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5)? Positions: after move, head (4,4), then previous head (5,4) becomes body, so (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection L (left).\n\nTurn 10: from (4,4), move down to (4,3), no food.\n\nTurn 11: from (4,3), move down to (4,2) eat food, grow.\n\nSo I eat (4,2) on turn 11.\n\nCompared to the first path where I went down to (5,2) first, I eat (4,2) later.\n\nIn first path, after being at (5,2) on turn 10, I move to (4,2) on turn 11 to eat.\n\nSame as here, turn 11 eat.\n\nBut in first path, I have the option to eat (5,2) if it were there, but it's not.\n\nNow, the risk in going to (5,2): when I am at (5,2), y=2, near wall y=0, and with obstacle at (3,1), which might block.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), I can move to (4,2), (5,1), (6,2), (5,3).\n\n(5,1) is y=1, close to wall.\n\nBut not immediately dangerous.\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, so cells around it might be tight.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nGrid:\n\ny=7 wall\n\ny=6\n\ny=5: snake body parts? At turn 10, snake might be at different positions.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the board state.\n\nSince all foods are positive and I can eat them, I should eat the one with short life first if possible, but I can't for (5,2).\n\n(5,4) has medium life, (4,2) long life.\n\nBut since I can eat (5,4) now, it might be good to eat it to grow and have more body for later, but in Snake, longer snake is harder to maneuver, but here grid is small, length 5 is ok.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nSuppose after eating (4,2), the head is near the tail.\n\nBut let's not worry yet.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (5,4) now to keep the area open, but I think eating is better for score.\n\nBut score is based on food eaten, so I should eat when possible.\n\nBut in the second option, if I move right first, I don't eat on turn 8, so I might be able to eat multiple foods in a row or something, but no other foods.\n\nOnly three foods.\n\nSo eating (5,4) on turn 8 seems fine.\n\nThen I can go for (4,2).\n\nBut let's see if I can eat both (5,4) and (4,2) efficiently.\n\nFrom turn 8: move D to (5,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (4,4) no food.\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (4,3) no food.\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2) eat.\n\nOr from (4,4), I could move directly to (4,2)? No, not adjacent.\n\nMust move step by step.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), snake longer.\n\nBut I need to think about after that.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,1) is below (4,2), so from (4,2), I can move up, left, right, down.\n\nDown to (4,1), but y=1, or to (3,2), but (3,2) might be near obstacle, but (3,1) is obstacle, so (3,2) is empty, I think.\n\nCells: (3,1) is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2).\n\n(3,2) is adjacent, but (3,1) is wall, so (3,2) is safe.\n\nR to (5,2) but no food.\n\nThen I can go up or something.\n\nBut no more food, so I need to survive.\n\nBut the game might continue with new food, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps after eating all food, I just survive as long as possible, but since no new food, score is fixed once all food eaten or disappeared.\n\nBut food can disappear, so I should eat before they go.\n\n(4,2) has life to turn 16, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (5,2) will disappear uneaten.\n\nNow, back to turn 8 decision.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake direction and future moves.\n\nIf I move down on turn 8, head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen I can go down to (5,3), etc., as above.\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), head at (6,5), direction R, but then I can only go U or D, since R to (7,5) wall, L to (5,5) body.\n\nSo I have to go U or D, say D to (6,4), then L to (5,4) to eat, but that takes two extra moves.\n\nBy moving down now, I save moves and eat sooner.\n\nMoreover, in the right move, on turn 8, if I move R to (6,5), the cell (5,5) is now body, and (5,4) has food, but I can't eat it directly.\n\nBut later I can.\n\nBut since the score is the same, and I get the point earlier by eating now, but in terms of game, score is cumulative, so eating earlier doesn't matter, as long as I eat before it disappears.\n\nBut for long-term, by eating now, I grow, which might help or hinder.\n\nBut in this case, with length 5, I can still move around.\n\nThe area near (4,2) and (3,1) might be tight.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,2), if I am at (4,2), and snake body behind, I might be near walls.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nSuppose I take the first path: turn 8: D to (5,4) eat, length 5, positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,3), no food, positions: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5)\n\nTurn 10: D to (5,2), no food (gone), positions: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — tail at (4,5)\n\nNow at (5,2), I can move to (4,2) on turn 11 to eat.\n\nTurn 11: L to (4,2) eat, grow to length 6, positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — since ate, tail stays, so (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, the body is a bit messy; let's list: head (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo it's like a C shape or something.\n\nFrom (4,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, occupied, so cannot move R.\n\nL to (3,2), U to (4,3), D to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is y=1, close to wall.\n\n(3,2) is empty, I think.\n\nBut (3,1) is wall, so (3,2) is safe.\n\nU to (4,3) is also possible.\n\nBut no food, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (4,1), then at (4,1), y=1, walls at y=0.\n\nThen I can move L to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, invalid, R to (5,1), U to (4,2) but (4,2) is now body? After moving to (4,2), it's head, but when I move away, (4,2) becomes body.\n\nOn turn 11, after eating, head at (4,2), so (4,2) is head.\n\nIf I move D to (4,1) on turn 12, then (4,2) becomes body.\n\nBut at that time, (4,1) is new head.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, so collision, or L to (3,1) wall, or R to (5,1), or D to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,1) is R to (5,1) or U to (4,2) but U to (4,2) is body, occupied, so only R to (5,1) if possible.\n\n(5,1) is x=5,y=1, not wall.\n\nBut if I go to (4,1), I might get stuck.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (3,2) from (4,2), then at (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) wall, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) body.\n\nSo D and R invalid, so U or L.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut it's a bit constrained.\n\nWhereas if from (4,2) I move U to (4,3), then I am at (4,3), and can go to (4,4) or (5,3) etc., more space.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have body at (5,2), (5,3), etc., so (4,3) might be free.\n\nIn positions at turn 11 after eating: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,2) head, (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (4,3) is free, (4,4) free, (3,2) free, etc.\n\nFrom (4,2), moving U to (4,3) is possible, and (4,3) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (3,2) empty.\n\nMoving D to (4,1) empty but risky as above.\n\nMoving R to (5,2) but occupied by body, so impossible.\n\nSo best to move U or L to open area.\n\nBut not immediately dangerous.\n\nNow, back to turn 8.\n\nIf I don't eat (5,4) now, and move right, then on turn 10 I eat (5,4), but the snake is shorter for two turns, but same final length if I eat all.\n\nBut I can only eat two foods, since (5,2) can't be eaten.\n\n(5,2) is uneaten, so only two foods to eat.\n\nIn both cases, I eat two foods, score +2.\n\nBy eating (5,4) earlier, I have a longer snake sooner, but it might not matter.\n\nBut for survival, shorter snake might be easier to maneuever.\n\nBut length 5 vs 4, not big difference.\n\nIn the path where I move right first, on turn 8: R to (6,5), no eat, positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — length 4\n\nTurn 9: D to (6,4), no eat, positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 10: L to (5,4) eat, grow to length 5, positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to (4,2) as before.\n\nFor example, turn 11: from (5,4), move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), etc.\n\nThen to (4,2).\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nThe only difference is that in this case, the body is at (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is different, but not necessarily better.\n\nMoreover, by moving right, I used turns 8 and 9 without eating, whereas in the first option, I ate on turn 8.\n\nSince the game might end or something, but no, I need to survive, but score is from food, so eating sooner doesn't change score, only that I have the point.\n\nBut for long-term, it might affect future food spawn, but the problem doesn't say new food spawns, so with only these foods, score is fixed at 2 if I eat both, or 1 if I eat one, but I can eat both.\n\n(5,2) I can't eat, so max score 2.\n\nSo in terms of score, both paths get +2.\n\nBut by eating earlier, I reduce the risk of food disappearing, but (5,4) has life to turn 13, so plenty of time.\n\n(4,2) to turn 16.\n\nSo no rush.\n\nBut there is the expiring (5,2), but I can't eat it, so ignore.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut from current position, impossible.\n\nUnless I move down on turn 8 to (5,4), then on turn 9, from (5,4), I can move down to (5,3), but (5,3) not adjacent to (5,2) for eating on same turn.\n\nNo, to eat on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 9, I can only be at cells adjacent to (5,5) on turn 8, so (5,6), (5,4), (6,5), none of which is (5,2) or adjacent except (5,4) is not adjacent to (5,2).\n\n(5,4) is adjacent to (5,3) and (5,5), etc., not to (5,2).\n\nSo impossible to eat (5,2), so I should accept that.\n\nSo for turn 8, moving down to eat (5,4) seems reasonable.\n\nThen I can head towards (4,2).\n\nBut to avoid the tight spot at bottom, I could go left first.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4) on turn 8, on turn 9 move left to (4,4) instead of down.\n\nThen to (4,3), then to (4,2).\n\nIn this case, I stay at higher y, less risk with walls.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go down to (4,3), then to (4,2).\n\nOr from (4,4), I can go to other places.\n\nBut (4,2) is below.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,1) is below, so from (4,2), moving down might be limited, but I can move up or left.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nSince the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide a sequence for multiple turns.\n\nAnswer format is to list actions for several turns starting from t1=8.\n\nBut I need to specify how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer should list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., for some number.\n\nProbably for the immediate decision and a few ahead.\n\nBut I need to commit to a path.\n\nPerhaps for turn 8, move down to eat the food.\n\nThen for future turns, plan to go to (4,2).\n\nBut to be specific.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,4) can be eaten later, and I can go directly to (4,2) first.\n\nBut (4,2) has long life, so I can eat (5,4) first.\n\nBut from (5,5), to go to (4,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut I cannot move left directly.\n\nSo move down to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then down to (4,3), then to (4,2).\n\nOr from (5,5), move right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then left to (5,4), but that takes longer to eat (5,4).\n\nI think moving down on turn 8 is best.\n\nThen for turn 9, from (5,4), I can move left to (4,4) to start going towards (4,2).\n\nThen turn 10, from (4,4) move down to (4,3).\n\nTurn 11, from (4,3) move down to (4,2) eat.\n\nThen for turn 12, from (4,2) move up to (4,3) or something to avoid dead end.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 8: move D to (5,4) eat food.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), move L to (4,4) no food.\n\nThen turn 10: from (4,4), move D to (4,3) no food.\n\nTurn 11: from (4,3), move D to (4,2) eat food.\n\nThen after that, I need to move away, say turn 12: from (4,2), move U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body? At turn 11, after eating (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) let's track.\n\nAt turn 11: after moving to (4,2) and eating, snake is: head (4,2), then the previous head (4,3) becomes body, so (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and (4,5)? From turn 10: before turn 11, positions at turn 10 end: after turn 10 move to (4,3), so head at (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)? Let's start from turn 9.\n\nAfter turn 8: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4), no eat, so head moves to (4,4), tail moves, so new positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — tail at (4,5)? Original body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,4), head (4,4), then previous head (5,4) becomes body, so (4,4), (5,4), then the body segments shift, so (5,5) next, then (4,5), then (3,5) — but since no eat, tail moves, so (2,5) is removed, so positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — and (3,5) gone? List indices.\n\nPositions: before move, turn 8 end: [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter move left to (4,4), no food, so head to (4,4), then the body: the first body segment is (5,4), which was the previous head position, but since head moved, (5,4) becomes the new first body segment, then (5,5), then (4,5), and since no eat, the last segment (2,5) is removed, so snake is [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] — length 4? No, after turn 8, length 5, but after move without eating, length should be 5 still? Mistake.\n\nAfter eating on turn 8, length 5: positions [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nOn turn 9, move to (4,4), no food.\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nThen the body: the segment that was at (5,4) is now at the position, but since head moved, the body follows.\n\nThe new body segments are: the previous head position (5,4) becomes the first body segment, then the previous body segments except the tail is removed if no growth.\n\nStandard Snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nSo here, head moves to (4,4), so new head (4,4)\n\nThen the first body segment is at the previous head position (5,4)\n\nThen the next body segment is at (5,5) (which was the first body)\n\nThen (4,5) (second body)\n\nThen (3,5) (third body), and the tail (2,5) is removed.\n\nSo positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] and (3,5) is gone, so only four segments? But length should be 5 until I eat again.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nInitial length after turn 8 eat: 5 segments.\n\nWhen I move without eating, head to new cell, tail is removed, so length decreases? No, in Snake, when you don't eat, the length stays the same, but the tail moves, so one segment is added at head, one removed at tail, so length constant.\n\nPositions: new head position, then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nSo for list: new head, then the previous head, then the previous body up to the second last.\n\nExample: positions before move: [H, B1, B2, B3, T]\n\nAfter move to new cell, no eat: new positions [newH, H, B1, B2, B3] and T is removed.\n\nSo length same.\n\nIn this case, turn 8 end: [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] so H=(5,4), B1=(5,5), B2=(4,5), B3=(3,5), T=(2,5)\n\nTurn 9 move to (4,4) no eat: new head (4,4), then previous H (5,4), then B1 (5,5), then B2 (4,5), then B3 (3,5), and T (2,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nYes, length 5, tail at (3,5).\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (4,3), no food, so head to (4,3), then previous head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), and tail (3,5) removed, so positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\n(4,5) is still there.\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (4,2) eat food, so head to (4,2), and since eat, tail not removed, so positions: new head (4,2), then previous head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — so length 6.\n\nThen from here, I can move U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied, or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2), or D to (4,1).\n\n(4,3) is body, so cannot move U.\n\nL to (3,2) possible, R to (5,2) possible, D to (4,1) possible.\n\nSay move L to (3,2) on turn 12.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut no food, so survival.\n\nNow for the initial move, I think D on turn 8 is fine.\n\nPerhaps to provide the sequence for 5 turns.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 8 action.\n\nAnd I need to output for several turns.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I can provide turn 8 to turn 12 or something.\n\nBut the food at (5,2) can be ignored.\n\nAnother point: in the state, there is internal obstacle at (3,1), but it doesn't affect the path to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), (3,1) is at (3,1), so moving to (3,2) is safe.\n\nI think moving down on turn 8 is the best choice.\n\nSo for turn 8: move D\n\nThen for future turns, as above.\n\nBut to write the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score, I need to eat both available positive foods (at (5,4) and (4,2)) while avoiding the expiring food at (5,2), which cannot be eaten due to turn constraints. The food at (5,2) has a life span of 2, meaning it disappears after turn 9, so it cannot be reached in time from the current position. The food at (5,4) has a life span of 6 (available until turn 13), and the food at (4,2) has a life span of 9 (available until turn 16), so there is no urgency for these. However, eating earlier allows the snake to grow, which can improve reachability but increases collision risk. After evaluating paths 5+ turns ahead:\n\n- **Immediate action (turn 8)**: Move down (D) to (5,4) to eat the positive food there. This scores +1, increases length to 5, and positions the snake closer to (4,2). Moving right (R) or up (U) delays eating and gains no advantage.\n- **Subsequent actions**: After eating (5,4), move left (L) to (4,4) on turn 9 to start heading toward (4,2). Then move down (D) to (4,3) on turn 10, and down (D) again to (4,2) on turn 11 to eat the second food. This path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions, and it minimizes risk by staying in open areas.\n- **Risks considered**: \n  - The tail reward danger is not triggered, as the head is never adjacent to the tail when food is present.\n  - The internal obstacle at (3,1) is avoided by not moving directly toward it.\n  - Wall collisions are avoided by staying within bounds (x=1-6, y=1-6 during this sequence).\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 11, the snake has eaten all available food and can focus on evasion. Moving up or left from (4,2) on turn 12 opens space and avoids the bottom wall (y=0).\n\nThe sequence for turns 8-12 is safe and achieves the maximum score of +2. Actions beyond turn 12 depend on new states but are not critical for this decision.\n\n### Answer\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D (down)  \nTurn 9: L (left)  \nTurn 10: D (down)  \nTurn 11: D (down)  \nTurn 12: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake, and I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t1 = 9. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement, so I can't go to those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,4), then body segments at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is D, meaning down, so it was moving down to (5,4) from (5,5) I assume.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,2) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and current turn is 9, it will disappear after turn 9, meaning it's only available on turn 9. Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn, so I can only eat it on turn 9 if I move there.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (5,2) with life span 1, on turn 9 it exists, and after turn 9, it disappears. So I can eat it on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will exist for 8 turns starting from turn 9, meaning it disappears after turn 16 (since 9 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if it spawns at turn S, it exists from turn S to turn S + N - 1? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span L at turn T, the countdown is L. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn, if countdown > 0, food exists. After the turn, countdown decreases. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n\nBut for movement and eating, we care about when the head moves onto the cell.\n\nAssume that food is present during a turn if its remaining life span at the start of the turn is at least 1. After the turn, life span decreases.\n\nFor food at (5,2), life span 1 at turn 9: at start of turn 9, life span=1, so it exists. If head moves to (5,2) on turn 9, it can be eaten. Then after turn 9, life span decreases to 0, so it disappears, not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,2), life span 8 at turn 9: exists from turn 9 to turn 16, since after 8 decreases, it will be gone after turn 16 (turn 9: life=8, turn 10: life=7, ..., turn 16: life=1, after turn 16 life=0, gone).\n\nTurn 9: life=8, exists\n\nTurn 10: life=7, exists\n\n...\n\nTurn 16: life=1, exists\n\nAfter turn 16, life=0, gone, so not on turn 17.\n\nBut for eating, on turn 16, if head moves there, can eat, then it disappears after.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,4), direction down. So from (5,5) to (5,4), moving down.\n\nAvailable moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so I cannot instantly reverse to U (up) because of no instant reverse rule. So possible moves are D, L, R, but not U.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo cells I cannot move to: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, (7,y) for y=0 to 7, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, (x,7) for x=0 to 7, and (3,1).\n\nAlso, snake body: positions (5,4) head, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5).\n\nSo the cells occupied by snake: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5).\n\nNow, head at (5,4), moving from down, so previous was (5,5), so tail is (2,5).\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- Down (D): to (5,3) — y decreases when down? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n\nU: (x,y+1) — so y+1 is up, meaning y increases as we go up? Or down?\n\nStandard: in computer graphics, often y increases downward, but here U is (x,y+1), which might imply y+1 is upward if we think of (0,0) bottom-left, but let's see.\n\nThe walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom or top?\n\nIt doesn't specify, but since U is (x,y+1), and D is (x,y-1), it might be that y=0 is the bottom, so moving down decreases y.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBut for collision, we don't care, just the coordinates.\n\nHead at (5,4). Moving D to (5,3) would be down.\n\nBut (5,3): is it valid?\n\nFirst, walls: x=5, y=3, not border (borders x=0,7 y=0,7), and not (3,1), so no wall.\n\nBody: snake positions: (5,4) head, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). (5,3) is not in body, so ok.\n\nBut after moving, the snake moves, so we need to consider where the body will be.\n\nFor collision, when head moves to a cell, it should not be a wall or body except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (2,5). When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed or stays depending on eating.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves away, so head can move to the current tail position.\n\nSimilarly, if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so head cannot move to tail position if it would cause collision after growth.\n\nBut let's see possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- U (up): (x,y+1) = (5,5) — but (5,5) is currently occupied by the body. But since it's the next segment, and after move, the body will move, but at the moment of head move, (5,5) is occupied, so if head moves there, it collides with body, unless it's the tail.\n\n(5,5) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is (2,5).\n\nSo moving to (5,5) would be collision because (5,5) is a body segment that won't move away immediately; only tail can be moved onto.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n\nIf it is the tail, and no food eaten, then tail moves, so it's ok.\n\nHere, (5,5) is not tail, tail is (2,5), so moving to (5,5) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, D (down): to (5,3) — (5,3) is empty, no body, no wall, so possible.\n\nL (left): to (4,4) — (4,4) is empty? Snake positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc., not (4,4), and no wall, so possible.\n\nR (right): to (6,4) — (6,4) not wall, not body, possible.\n\nBut cannot move U because it would be reverse and also occupied.\n\nCurrent direction is D, moving down to (5,4), so reverse would be U, which is up.\n\nAnd U to (5,5) is occupied by body, so definitely not possible.\n\nSo possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nD: to (5,3)\n\nL: to (4,4)\n\nR: to (6,4)\n\nNow, food locations: (5,2) with value 1, life span 1, so only on turn 9.\n\n(4,2) with value 1, life span 8, so available for several turns.\n\n(5,2) is at y=2, x=5.\n\nFrom head (5,4), to reach (5,2), I need to go down twice, but (5,2) is at y=2, head at y=4, so down to y=3, then down to y=2.\n\nBut (5,2) has life span 1, only available on turn 9. If I don't eat it on turn 9, it disappears.\n\nTurn 9 is current turn, so I need to move to (5,2) on this turn to eat it.\n\nBut can I? From (5,4), if I move down to (5,3), that's turn 9 action. Then on turn 10, I could move to (5,2), but by then, the food might be gone.\n\nFood at (5,2) with life span 1: at turn 9, it exists; after turn 9, it disappears. So to eat it, I must move head to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut head is at (5,4) on turn 9, and I move during turn 9 to a new position.\n\nSo for turn 9, if I choose to move down to (5,3), I don't eat the food at (5,2), and it disappears.\n\nIf I could move directly to (5,2), but I can't, because from (5,4), I can only move to adjacent cells: (5,3) down, (4,4) left, (6,4) right, or up but not possible.\n\n(5,2) is not adjacent to (5,4); it's two cells away. So I cannot reach (5,2) on turn 9; it's impossible. Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (5,2) because it will disappear after this turn, and I can't get there in one move.\n\nDistance: from (5,4) to (5,2) is |dy|=2, so two moves away. On turn 9, I move to one of the adjacent cells, but not to (5,2). So I cannot eat it on turn 9. Therefore, it will disappear, and I miss it.\n\nSo food at (5,2) is unattainable; I should ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (4,2) at (4,2), value 1, life span 8, so available from turn 9 to turn 16.\n\nI need to think about getting to (4,2) or other actions.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the current state.\n\nGrid: let's sketch a small grid for rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\ny=7 top? Since U is (x,y+1), let's assume y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so U increases y, D decreases y.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So at row y=5, from x=2 to x=5, and also head at (5,4) y=4.\n\nPositions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), and head at (5,4). So the body is horizontal at y=5 from x=2 to 5, head at (5,4) below.\n\nDirection down, so moving down from (5,5) to (5,4).\n\nFood: (5,2) at (5,2) — y=2, x=5, below.\n\n(4,2) at (4,2) — y=2, x=4.\n\nSince (5,2) food is unattainable and disappears, I can forget it.\n\nNow, possible moves for turn 9:\n\n- D: to (5,3)\n\n- L: to (4,4)\n\n- R: to (6,4)\n\nI need to evaluate these options with long-term survival and scoring.\n\nAlso, tail is at (2,5), which might move.\n\nI should think about the future.\n\nFirst, if I go down to (5,3): then snake positions after move: head to (5,3), body: (5,4) becomes new segment 1, then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) is removed since no food eaten. So new positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] — head at (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). Tail is (3,5).\n\nDirection: I moved down, so head direction becomes D.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go to (5,2), but (5,2) has food, but it will be gone after turn 9, so on turn 10, (5,2) is empty, no food.\n\n(5,2) food disappears after turn 9, so on turn 10, no food there.\n\nIf I go to (5,3) on turn 9, then on turn 10, I can go down to (5,2), but no food, or left to (4,3), or right to (6,3), or up to (5,4) but (5,4) is now body, so if I go up to (5,4), it would be collision unless it's tail, but (5,4) is the second segment, not tail.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nSo (5,4) is occupied by body.\n\nIf I move up to (5,4) from (5,3), that would be reverse? Direction: after moving down to (5,3), head direction is D. Moving up to (5,4) would be opposite to current direction, so not allowed? No instant reverse rule.\n\nCurrent direction after move: I moved down to (5,3), so direction is D. Then next turn, I cannot move up, because U is opposite to D.\n\nSimilarly, I can move D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,2) is empty now, since food gone.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nFood at (4,2) is available.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), which is left and down from current head (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,4), if I move left to (4,4), that's one option.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (4,2) in two moves: down to (4,3), then down to (4,2), or other paths.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (6,4), then (4,2) is farther.\n\nOr down to (5,3), then I can go left to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut I need to consider risks.\n\nAlso, there is a special case: tail reward danger.\n\nIf head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,5), head at (5,4), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, |dy|=1 or same y, |dx|=1.\n\n(5,4) and (2,5): dx=3, dy=1, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n\nBut I need to think about future.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but here foods are at (5,2) and (4,2), not under snake currently. Snake is at y=4 and y=5, foods at y=2.\n\n(5,2) is under where? Snake body has (5,5), but (5,2) is different cell.\n\nNot under.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I want to eat positive food, both are +1.\n\n(5,2) is impossible, so only (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut I can eat it later, life span 8, so I have time.\n\nBut I should plan a path to it safely.\n\nAlso, need to avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid with walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders, so I can only be from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except where internal walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nAlso, y=1 row, but (3,1) blocked, so cells (x,1) for x=1,2,4,5,6 are free? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 except walls.\n\ny=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are free, since (3,1) wall.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut snake is at y=4,5, food at y=2.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Move down to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nThen snake: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nOn turn 10, I can move:\n\n- D to (5,2): but no food, and (5,2) is empty.\n\n- L to (4,3): (4,3) should be empty.\n\n- R to (6,3): empty.\n\nCannot go up, reverse.\n\nThen, from there, I can go to (4,2) for example.\n\nBut (4,2) has food.\n\nFrom (5,3), if I go left to (4,3) on turn 10, then head at (4,3), direction L (if I moved left).\n\nThen on turn 11, I can go down to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\n(4,2) has food, value +1, so eating it increases length.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, when I eat at (4,2), what happens.\n\nIf I eat on turn 11, for example.\n\nBut I need to think from turn 9.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (4,4) on turn 9.\n\nThen snake: head to (4,4), body: (5,4) becomes new segment, then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) removed. So positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead direction: moved left, so now L.\n\nOn turn 10, from (4,4), I can move:\n\n- L to (3,4): (3,4) is empty? Snake has (3,5), but (3,4) different, no wall.\n\n(3,4) should be free.\n\n- D to (4,3): empty.\n\n- U to (4,5): but (4,5) is body segment. (4,5) is in positions, it's the fourth segment? Positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So (4,5) is occupied. Moving to (4,5) would be collision.\n\nAlso, cannot move right because reverse? Current direction L, moving right to (5,4) would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: L to (3,4), D to (4,3), or U but U to (4,5) is occupied, so not possible. Only L and D.\n\nU to (4,5) is invalid because occupied and not tail.\n\nSo only L or D.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) or (3,4).\n\nThen to (4,2).\n\nFor example, if I go down to (4,3) on turn 10, then to (4,2) on turn 11 to eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nOption 3: Move right to (6,4) on turn 9.\n\nThen snake: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nOn turn 10, can move R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,3), U to (6,5), L to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, and L is opposite to R? Current direction R, moving L to (5,4) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), or R but R to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,5): is it free? (6,5) should be empty.\n\nD to (6,3) empty.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nThen from there, to get to (4,2) is farther, not efficient.\n\nSo moving right seems worse for getting to food quickly.\n\nTherefore, better to move left or down to approach (4,2).\n\nBut moving down to (5,3) or left to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go directly down to (4,3) then (4,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), I need to go left to (4,3) first, then down to (4,2), so one extra move.\n\nBut not a big deal.\n\nNow, I need to consider safety.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,2), the snake grows, and I need to find space.\n\nCurrent length 5, after eating, length 6.\n\nThe grid has limited space.\n\nLet me sketch the area.\n\nList free cells.\n\nRows y=0 to 7, but walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable, similarly x=1 to 6.\n\ny=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — (3,1) wall.\n\ny=2: all x=1 to 6 except no wall, so (1,2) to (6,2)\n\ny=3: (1,3) to (6,3)\n\ny=4: (1,4) to (6,4)\n\ny=5: (1,5) to (6,5)\n\ny=6: (1,6) to (6,6)\n\nBut snake occupies some.\n\nCurrently, snake: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo occupied: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nFree cells: many, but after moving, it changes.\n\nFood at (4,2).\n\nIf I move to (4,4) on turn 9, then on turn 10 to (4,3), turn 11 to (4,2) eat.\n\nOn turn 11, if I move to (4,2), it has food, so I eat it, length increases to 6.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head at (4,2), body: previous positions without removing tail.\n\nBefore move: suppose on turn 11, head at (4,3), body behind.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 9: move left to (4,4)\n\nAfter turn 9: snake: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]  // tail (3,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 10: move down to (4,3)\n\nNow, no food at (4,3), so tail moves: head to (4,3), then body: (4,4) becomes segment, (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), and tail (3,5) removed. So positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]  // (4,5) is tail? Segments: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). So tail at (4,5)\n\nDirection: moved down, so D.\n\nTurn 11: move down to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) has food, so eat it. Length increases, tail not removed.\n\nSo positions: head to (4,2), then body: all previous segments, so [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]  // since (4,5) was tail, now not removed, so snake has 6 segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nNow, the body is a bit tangled: from head (4,2), to (4,3), (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at left of (5,5), but it's connected.\n\nNow, head at (4,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,2), I can go U to (4,3), but (4,3) is body segment, occupied, and not tail, so collision if I go there.\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) is it wall? y=1, x=4, not border? Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1) is not border, and not (3,1), so free. But is it free now? No snake body there.\n\nL to (3,2): (3,2) should be free.\n\nR to (5,2): (5,2) no food, free.\n\nBut U to (4,3) is body, invalid.\n\nD to (4,1) possible.\n\nL to (3,2) possible.\n\nR to (5,2) possible.\n\nNow, tail is at (4,5), which is far.\n\nBut if I go up to (4,3), it's body, not possible.\n\nSo I must go down, left, or right.\n\nGoing down to (4,1): (4,1) is bottom row, y=1.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut y=1 has the obstacle at (3,1), so cells available: (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) since (3,1) wall.\n\nSo from (4,1), I can go L to (3,1) but wall, cannot.\n\nR to (5,1), U to (4,2) but (4,2) is now body? After eating, positions: head at (4,2), body (4,3), etc., so (4,2) is head, (4,3) is body.\n\nSo U from (4,2) to (4,3) is invalid.\n\nD to (4,1), then from (4,1), can go to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (5,1), or U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body now, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,1), only possible moves: U to (4,2) but body, invalid; R to (5,1); L to (3,1) wall; D to (4,0) wall.\n\nSo only R to (5,1) is possible.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go to (5,2), (6,1), or U to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIn this path, after eating at (4,2) on turn 11, head at (4,2), I can go down to (4,1) on turn 12.\n\nThen to (5,1) on turn 13, and so on.\n\nBut the area around y=1 might be tight.\n\nIf I had moved differently.\n\nBack to turn 9 choices.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move down to (5,3).\n\nThen after turn 9: snake [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 10: move left to (4,3) — assuming I want to go to (4,2)\n\n(4,3) is empty? Yes.\n\nMove to (4,3), no food.\n\nThen positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\nDirection: moved left, so L.\n\nTurn 11: move down to (4,2)\n\nEat food at (4,2).\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // length 6\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, invalid.\n\nD to (4,1)\n\nL to (3,2)\n\nR to (5,2)\n\nSame as before, U invalid, so D, L, or R.\n\nIf I go down to (4,1), same as before, then to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut in this case, the body is different.\n\nPositions: (4,2) head, (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (4,5) is tail.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go left to (3,2), that might be better.\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger later.\n\nFirst, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince both paths lead to similar situation after eating, I should consider not eating immediately if there is risk.\n\nBut (4,2) is safe to eat, no immediate danger.\n\nThe issue is after eating, I might be cornered.\n\nBut I can move around.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might affect movements near bottom.\n\nI should think about exploring the grid for more food, but currently only one food, and I don't know if more spawn, but the state only gives current food, so I assume no new food for now, only these.\n\nThe state has only these two foods, and (5,2) disappears.\n\nSo only one food to eat.\n\nBut after eating, I need to survive and wait for more food, but since no more food mentioned, perhaps I should just survive.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so eating food is good, but survival is key.\n\nI can eat the food later.\n\nFor example, if I move right on turn 9 to (6,4), then I can go to other areas, but (4,2) might be eaten by others? No, only me.\n\nBut it has life span 8, so I can eat it on turn 10,11, etc.\n\nBut if I delay, it might be harder to reach or something.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should eat it when convenient.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead from turn 9.\n\nTurn 9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1, for how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should list actions for the turns, but it doesn't specify how many to list.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... }\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 turns, but list the actions for as many as I decide, but probably for the immediate future.\n\nSince the state has food with life span, I need to act within that.\n\nBut (4,2) has life span 8, so I have time.\n\nBut to score, I should eat it as soon as safe.\n\nNow, another risk: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I eat at (4,2), the tail is at (4,5) or (3,5) depending on path, not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nAfter that, if tail has food, but no food on tail.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but not now.\n\nI think eating (4,2) is safe.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, and in the bottom left, it might be tight.\n\nLet's see the grid size: 6x6 playable area, minus obstacle, 35 cells, snake length 6, so 29 free cells, plenty of space.\n\nNot tight.\n\nI can move around.\n\nFor example, from head at (4,2) after eating, I can go left to (3,2), then to (2,2), (1,2), etc., or down to (4,1), then to (5,1), etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo eating (4,2) is fine.\n\nNow, back to turn 9 action.\n\nIf I move left to (4,4) on turn 9, I can eat on turn 11.\n\nIf I move down to (5,3) on turn 9, I can eat on turn 11 as well, with an extra move to (4,3).\n\nWith move down on turn 9: to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10: to (4,3) or directly if possible, but from (5,3) to (4,2) not adjacent, so must go to (4,3) or (5,2), but (5,2) no food.\n\nGo to (4,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen turn 11 to (4,2) eat.\n\nSame as moving left on turn 9 to (4,4), then turn 10 to (4,3), turn 11 to (4,2).\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 11.\n\nWith move left on turn 9: positions after: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nThen turn 10 to (4,3): positions (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 11 to (4,2) eat: positions (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nWith move down on turn 9 to (5,3): positions (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nTurn 10 to (4,3): positions (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 11 to (4,2) eat: positions (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThe body shape is different, but similar.\n\nIn both cases, after eating, head at (4,2) with body around.\n\nNow, moving right on turn 9 is worse because it takes longer to reach the food.\n\nFor example, turn 9 to (6,4), then turn 10 to (6,3) or (6,5), then I need to go left to (5,3) etc., more turns to reach (4,2), and food might disappear later, but life span 8, so ok, but inefficient for scoring.\n\nSo better to move left or down.\n\nNow, which one is safer?\n\nAfter eating, in both cases, I have to move from (4,2) to avoid collision.\n\nIn the move left path, after eating, positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go L to (3,2), D to (4,1), or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I go L to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), then only R to (5,1) as before.\n\n(4,1) to (5,1) is ok.\n\nIn the move down path, positions: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFrom (4,2), same moves: L to (3,2), D to (4,1), R to (5,2).\n\nIf I go R to (5,2), then to (5,1) or (6,2), etc.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nBut let's consider the internal obstacle.\n\n(3,1) is wall, so from (3,2), I can go down to (3,1) but wall, cannot, so only left, right, or up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) can only go right to (5,1), since left to (3,1) wall, down wall, up to (4,2) body.\n\nBut as long as I don't go there, it's fine.\n\nFor long-term, I should avoid the bottom row if possible, but it's manageable.\n\nAnother thing: since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize survival, I should consider if there are dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area near (3,1) might be tricky.\n\nBut with snake length 6, I can go to the top or right areas.\n\nFor instance, from (4,2), I can go to (3,2), then to (2,2), (1,2), or up to (3,3), etc.\n\ny=3 to 6 are mostly free.\n\nIn particular, the top right has space.\n\nNow, about the food: since I eat on turn 11, and after that, no food, I just need to survive, but probably more food will spawn later, but not specified, so I assume I need to move safely.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but since I think 5 ahead, perhaps 5 actions.\n\nBut turn t1=9, so turns 9 to 13 or 14.\n\nLet's define a plan.\n\nFirst, I need to choose turn 9 action.\n\nEither L or D.\n\nMoving L to (4,4) might be better because it directly approaches the food column.\n\nMoving D to (5,3) is also fine.\n\nBut let's see if one has advantage.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) on turn 9, then on turn 10, I have to move to (4,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), that delays going to food.\n\nBut I can go directly to (4,3) on turn 10 for food.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut in move L to (4,4), on turn 10, from (4,4), I can only move L or D, as U and R not possible or invalid.\n\nEarlier: from (4,4) after turn 9, direction L, so on turn 10, can move L to (3,4) or D to (4,3).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), then I need to go down later to approach (4,2).\n\nFor example, turn 10 to (3,4), then turn 11 to (3,3), turn 12 to (4,3) or (3,2), but (4,2) is at (4,2), so from (3,3) to (4,2) is adjacent, I can go on turn 12 to (4,2) if I want.\n\nBut it takes longer, and food life span 8, from turn 9 to 16, so turn 12 is fine, but I can eat earlier.\n\nSince scoring is immediate, eating sooner is better for score, but survival first.\n\nBut here, no risk, so eat on turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down first, same.\n\nSo for efficiency, move in a way to eat on turn 11.\n\nNow, for turn 9, moving left to (4,4) allows me to go directly down to (4,3) and (4,2).\n\nMoving down to (5,3) requires me to go left to (4,3) first.\n\nBut both take two moves to eat, since from (5,4) to (4,2) in two moves: (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2)? No.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (4,2) is not adjacent, so minimum two moves: e.g., (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) three moves? Positions.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (4,4) is one move left.\n\nThen from (4,4) to (4,3) down, one move.\n\nThen (4,3) to (4,2) down, one move.\n\nSo to reach (4,2) from (5,4) takes at least two moves: to (4,4) then to (4,3) then to (4,2), three moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,4) to (5,3) down, then to (4,3) left, then to (4,2) down, also three moves.\n\nDirectly to (4,2) not possible.\n\nSo minimum three turns to eat: turn 9,10,11 to move to the cell.\n\nOn turn 11, I move to (4,2) and eat.\n\nIf I go through (4,4), on turn 9 move to (4,4), turn 10 to (4,3), turn 11 to (4,2) eat.\n\nIf through (5,3), turn 9 to (5,3), turn 10 to (4,3), turn 11 to (4,2) eat.\n\nSame.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to move away.\n\nFor example, on turn 12, from (4,2), I can go to (3,2), (4,1), or (5,2).\n\n(4,1) might lead to corner, so better to go left or right.\n\nSay, go to (3,2) or (5,2).\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut since no food, I can just move safely.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, let's plan turns 9 to 13.\n\nTurn 9: action\n\nTurn 10: action\n\netc.\n\nI need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should move left on turn 9 to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 10: move down to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: move down to (4,2) and eat\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,2), move left to (3,2) for example, to go to open area.\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,2), I can move up to (3,3), or left to (2,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved down first, similar.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction for no reverse.\n\nIn the move left case:\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4), direction L\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,3), direction D (changed)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2), direction D\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,2), direction L (changed)\n\nAll fine, no reverse issue.\n\nSimilarly, if turn 9 move D to (5,3), direction D\n\nTurn 10 move L to (4,3), direction L\n\nTurn 11 move D to (4,2), direction D\n\nTurn 12 move L to (3,2), etc.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nNow, the only difference is the body position after eating.\n\nIn first case, body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nIn second case: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSlightly different, but no major risk.\n\nIn both, (4,5) is tail, which is at y=5, while head at y=2.\n\nI think moving left on turn 9 is slightly better because it brings me closer to the left side, which has the obstacle, but I can avoid it.\n\n(3,1) is at bottom left, so from (4,4), moving down, I go to (4,3), (4,2), then to (3,2), away from (3,1).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think either is ok.\n\nBut let's see the food at (4,2), and I eat it on turn 11.\n\nLife span 8 from turn 9, so on turn 11 it is available.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nPerhaps I can choose to move left on turn 9.\n\nThen for turn 10, move down to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11 move down to (4,2)\n\nThen for turn 12, move left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 13, from (3,2), I can move up to (3,3), or left to (2,2), or down but down to (3,1) wall, invalid, so only left, right, up.\n\n(3,2) to (3,1) down wall, so can go L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) is body after turn 11, so on turn 12, after moving to (3,2), positions change.\n\nLet's sequence with actions.\n\nTurn 11: after moving to (4,2) and eating, positions: (4,2) head, (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // for move left path\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,2)\n\nNo food, so tail moves: head to (3,2), then body: (4,2) becomes segment, (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail (4,5) removed? Tail is (4,5), but when head moves to (3,2), no food eaten, so tail (4,5) is removed, new positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)  // (5,5) is tail? Segments: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nDirection: moved left, so L.\n\nTurn 13: from (3,2), possible moves:\n\nL to (2,2): empty\n\nU to (3,3): empty\n\nR to (4,2): but (4,2) is body segment, occupied, invalid\n\nD to (3,1): wall, invalid\n\nSo only L to (2,2) or U to (3,3)\n\nSay, move U to (3,3)\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved down first, similar.\n\nSo for the answer, I can plan to eat the food and then move to open space.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but here no immediate threat, so eating food is good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating if it leads to trap, but here it doesn't.\n\nAnother point: the food at (5,2) is unattainable, so ignore.\n\nSo for turn 9, I'll move left to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 10 move down to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11 move down to (4,2) eat\n\nThen turn 12 move left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 13 move up to (3,3)\n\nBut I need to specify for how many turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 actions: turns 9 to 13.\n\nBut turn 13 is t1+4, since t1=9, t1+1=10, t1+2=11, t1+3=12, t1+4=13.\n\n5 turns: 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 11 I eat, good.\n\nTo be consistent, let's write the actions.\n\nIn the move, I need to specify the direction.\n\nAlso, for turn 9, current direction is D, I move L, which is not reverse, ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the other option, move down on turn 9, then left on 10, down on 11, same turn 11 eat.\n\nBut moving left first might be better because it doesn't go towards the bottom immediately, but not significant.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with moving left on turn 9.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the plan involves eating the positive food at (4,2) safely, as it provides a +1 reward and increases the snake's length. The food at (5,2) is unattainable on turn 9 due to its short life span (1 turn) and the distance from the head, so it is ignored. The snake must avoid collisions with walls, the internal obstacle at (3,1), and its own body, while adhering to movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Food at (4,2)**: Value +1, life span 8 (available from turn 9 to turn 16). Eating it on turn 11 is feasible and safe.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Current head direction is down (D). On turn 9, reverse move (up, U) is invalid due to the no-instant-reverse rule and body collision risk. Valid moves are down (D), left (L), or right (R).\n- **Path to Food**: Moving left (L) on turn 9 to (4,4) positions the snake optimally to reach (4,2) in two moves: down to (4,3) on turn 10, then down to (4,2) on turn 11 for eating.\n- **After Eating**: On turn 11, the snake length increases to 6. From (4,2), moving left to (3,2) on turn 12 avoids potential traps near the bottom row (y=1) and the obstacle at (3,1). Then, moving up to (3,3) on turn 13 explores open space for future food and survival.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No tail reward danger, as the tail is never adjacent to the head when eating.\n  - The bottom row (y=1) is risky due to walls and the obstacle; moving away minimizes danger.\n  - Body collisions are prevented by not moving into occupied cells except the tail (which moves).\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: The plan ensures the snake survives beyond turn 13 by moving to safer areas. After turn 13, the snake can navigate to open spaces (e.g., left or up) to await new food.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 9 to 13):\n- **Turn 9 (current)**: Move left (L) to (4,4). This approaches the food column and avoids the unattainable (5,2) food. Valid moves: L (to empty cell), no reverse (from D), no collision.\n- **Turn 10**: Move down (D) to (4,3). This continues toward the food. Direction changes from L to D (allowed), and (4,3) is empty.\n- **Turn 11**: Move down (D) to (4,2) and eat the food (+1 score, length 6). Direction remains D, and eating is safe (tail not adjacent).\n- **Turn 12**: Move left (L) to (3,2). This avoids the bottom row and moves toward open space. Direction changes from D to L (allowed), and (3,2) is empty.\n- **Turn 13**: Move up (U) to (3,3). This explores safer areas and avoids dead ends. Direction changes from L to U (allowed), and (3,3) is empty.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats the only available positive food quickly (turn 11), gaining +1.\n- **Survival Prioritized**: Avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After eating, moves to less constrained areas (e.g., from y=2 to y=3), reducing risk.\n- **Long-Term Viability**: By turn 13, the snake is in a flexible position (head at (3,3)) with access to multiple directions for future movement (e.g., left to (2,3), up to (3,4), or right to (4,3)). This allows adaptation to new food spawns.\n- **Efficiency**: Reaches food in minimal turns (3 turns from start) with no wasted moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: L\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: D\nTurn 12: L\nTurn 13: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 10. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (4,4) from (5,4), I assume.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,2) with life span 8, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,1) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. Rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head at (4,4), then (5,4) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5). So the tail is at (3,5).\n\nHead direction is left, so last move was left to (4,4). Since no instant reverse, I cannot move right immediately, because that would be opposite to left.\n\nPossible moves from head (4,4):\n\n- Up: (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by a body segment, the third segment. Let's list positions:\n\nIndex 0: head (4,4)\n\nIndex 1: (5,4)\n\nIndex 2: (5,5)\n\nIndex 3: (4,5)\n\nIndex 4: tail (3,5)\n\nSo from head (4,4), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (4,5) - occupied by body segment at index 3, so collision if I move there, unless it's the tail and tail moves away, but here (4,5) is not the tail; tail is (3,5). Moving to (4,5) would cause head to hit body, which is deadly.\n\n- Down: (4,3) - is this free? Let's see, no walls or obstacles mentioned except borders and (3,1). (4,3) should be within bounds, x=4 between 1-6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable? No.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are invalid. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. Also internal (3,1) obstacle.\n\nSo valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1).\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- (4,3): x=4, y=3. y=3 is between 1 and 6, so should be free unless occupied. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). No (4,3), and no food mentioned there, so should be empty.\n\n- Left: (3,4) - x=3, y=4. Is this free? Not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacle is (3,1), not (3,4). So should be free.\n\n- Right: (5,4) - but (5,4) is the second segment, index 1. Moving right would go to (5,4), which is occupied by body. Since it's not the tail, it would collide and die.\n\nAlso, cannot move right because head direction is left, and no instant reverse, so right is opposite, invalid move anyway.\n\nHead direction is L, so last move was left. Therefore, possible moves are not opposite, so not right. So cannot move right.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,5) - but (4,5) is occupied by body segment index 3. Moving there would cause collision with body.\n\n- Down: to (4,3) - seems free.\n\n- Left: to (3,4) - seems free.\n\n- Right: not possible, invalid due to reverse.\n\nSo only down or left are possible without immediate collision.\n\nBut down to (4,3) and left to (3,4) both seem safe for now.\n\nNow, food: one at (4,2), which is down from head, and another at (5,1), which is down-right, but not directly adjacent.\n\n(4,2) is directly below (4,4), so two steps down: (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which from (4,4) is right and down, so not adjacent.\n\nAlso, life spans: (4,2) has life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns, including current turn? Let's see the state: current turn t=10.\n\nFood life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for (4,2), life span 8 at turn 10, so it will disappear after turn 10 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N turns it disappears. That means it lasts for N more turns, including turn t.\n\nStandard: if at turn t, life span is L, then it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something? Better to think in terms of turns left.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn 10, for (4,2), life span 8, so countdown is 8, meaning after 8 more turns it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17? Disappears after N turns, so if eaten on turn when countdown reaches 0?\n\nAssume: at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at the start of turn t + L, or end of turn t + L -1?\n\nTo avoid confusion, since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span L means it has L turns left including the current turn. So after L turns, it's gone.\n\nFor example, if L=1 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and disappears after turn t.\n\nIf L=2, can be eaten on turn t or t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nSo for (4,2) at t=10, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 10 to turn 17 inclusive? Turns 10 to 10+7=17, since 8 turns: t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17? 8 turns from t=10: turns 10 to 17 is 8 turns? Turn 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: that's 8 turns, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) life span 10, so from turn 10 to 19.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns, starting from turn 10.\n\nCurrent turn t=10.\n\nSnake head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nPossible actions: from above, down to (4,3) or left to (3,4). Up and right are invalid or deadly.\n\nNow, let's think about the food. (4,2) is at (4,2), which is two steps down from head. (5,1) is at (5,1), which is not directly on the way.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (4,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction down? After moving, the direction changes to the move direction.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction is updated to the move direction.\n\nSo if I move down, new head direction is D.\n\nThen on next turn, I can move from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,4), new direction L.\n\nNow, tail: when snake moves, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten yet, tail moves, so (3,5) will be vacated when snake moves.\n\nBut in terms of collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except the tail, it collides. But if it's the tail, and tail moves, it's ok.\n\nIn this case, from (4,4), moving to (4,3) or (3,4), neither is occupied, so no issue.\n\nNow, let's think about getting to the food.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2). From head (4,4), I can go down to (4,3), then down to (4,2) to eat it.\n\nBut is (4,2) safe to eat? I need to check if it's under the body or something.\n\nFood at (4,2): is it under snake body? Snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). None at (4,2), so it's not under snake. So can be eaten directly when head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) at (5,1), not occupied.\n\nBut (4,2) is closer.\n\nAlso, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, food is not on tail, tail is at (3,5), food at (4,2) and (5,1), not on tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut let's plan ahead.\n\nFirst, if I go for (4,2) directly.\n\nTurn 10: move down to (4,3)\n\nThen snake positions: head moves to (4,3), then body follows: the segment at (4,4) becomes body, (5,4) becomes next, etc., tail (3,5) moves off.\n\nAfter move down:\n\n- Head to (4,3)\n\n- Then the previous head (4,4) becomes body segment 1\n\n- (5,4) becomes segment 2\n\n- (5,5) becomes segment 3\n\n- (4,5) becomes segment 4\n\n- Tail was (3,5), but since no food eaten, tail moves to the previous segment position? Standard snake movement: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail cell is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (4,3), then body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). Tail is (4,5) now? Positions:\n\n- After move: head at new position, then the segments shift.\n\nInitial positions: indices: 0:(4,4), 1:(5,4), 2:(5,5), 3:(4,5), 4:(3,5)\n\nAfter moving down to (4,3):\n\n- New head at (4,3)\n\n- Then the body segments: the old head (4,4) is now first body segment, then (5,4) second, (5,5) third, (4,5) fourth, and the tail (3,5) is removed since no growth.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTail is at (4,5).\n\nDirection now down.\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can move to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\n(4,2) is free? Yes, and food is there.\n\nTurn 11: move down to (4,2)\n\nEat food: since positive, length increases, so tail does not move, new segment added.\n\nAfter eating: head at (4,2), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), and since eaten, the tail stays, so new tail is (4,5)? Let's see.\n\nPositions before move: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nAfter move to (4,2) and eat: head to (4,2), then the body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and since eaten, the tail (4,5) is not removed, but a new segment is added at the end? No.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the snake grows, so after head moves to food cell, the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at (4,2), then the previous head (4,3) becomes body, then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) remains as tail since no move.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nNow length 6.\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to think where to go next.\n\nBut let's see the other food at (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move left, right, down, or up? But direction down, so cannot move up (opposite) immediately? No instant reverse, but after moving, direction is updated.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,2), direction is down, so from (4,2), possible moves: down to (4,1), left to (3,2), right to (5,2), up to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied by body, and also up is opposite to down? Direction is down, so moving up would be reverse, invalid.\n\nSo cannot move up.\n\nDown to (4,1): y=1, which is not wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is valid, but is it free?\n\n(4,1): not occupied? Currently snake has (4,2), (4,3), etc., not (4,1). And no obstacle, so should be free.\n\nLeft to (3,2): free?\n\nRight to (5,2): free? (5,2) might be free.\n\nBut (5,1) is food, so I could go to (5,2) then down to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, after eating at (4,2) on turn 11, the snake is longer, and positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nNow, the grid has walls and obstacle at (3,1).\n\nAlso, from (4,2), moving down to (4,1) might be possible, but y=1 is not wall, but let's see the area.\n\ny=1 is the bottom row? y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable, y=7 wall.\n\nSimilarly x.\n\nNow, internal obstacle at (3,1), which is near (4,1) and (3,2).\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I move down to (4,1), that should be ok.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move left to (3,1) but (3,1) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr right to (5,1), which is food.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so from (4,1), moving right to (5,1) would eat it.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nFirst, back to turn 10 choice.\n\nI could go left to (3,4) instead of down.\n\nBut (4,2) is closer and life span 8, which is enough, but let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (4,5) after some moves, but let's simulate.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not going directly to food to avoid boxing in or something.\n\nBut let's think about the map.\n\nGrid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (3,1) obstacle.\n\nSnake occupies: after turn 10 down to (4,3), positions (4,3),(4,4),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5)\n\nThen turn 11 down to (4,2), eat, positions (4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5)\n\nNow, from (4,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down to (4,1): free? Yes, as above.\n\n- Left to (3,2): is (3,2) free? Currently no snake there, and not wall, obstacle is (3,1), not (3,2), so should be free.\n\n- Right to (5,2): free? (5,2) not occupied, should be free.\n\nCannot move up.\n\nIf I go to (4,1), then from (4,1), I can go right to (5,1) to eat, or left to (3,1) but obstacle, so only right or up, but up to (4,2) is body, and direction down, so up is reverse, invalid. So from (4,1), only possible moves: left invalid (obstacle or reverse? Direction down, moving left or right or down? From (4,1), adjacent cells: down to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; left to (3,1) obstacle; right to (5,1); up to (4,2) but occupied and reverse direction.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,1) is right to (5,1), since down and left invalid, up invalid.\n\n(4,1) to (5,1) is right, which is perpendicular to down, so not reverse. Reverse would be up.\n\nSo from (4,1), moving right to (5,1) is valid.\n\nThen eat (5,1).\n\nBut let's see turns.\n\nTurn 10: move down to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: move down to (4,2), eat (4,2) food, now length 6.\n\nTurn 12: from (4,2) move down to (4,1)\n\nNow at (4,1), direction down.\n\nTurn 13: move right to (5,1), eat (5,1) food, length 7.\n\nThen from (5,1), I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (5,1): direction right? After moving right, direction is R.\n\nAdjacent cells: down to (5,0) wall, invalid; left to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by body? After eating at (5,1), positions: before move to (5,1), head at (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) tail at (4,5).\n\nAfter move right to (5,1) and eat: head to (5,1), then body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail (4,5) remains since growth, so positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]? Let's list.\n\nAfter move: new head at (5,1), previous head (4,1) becomes first body, then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and (4,5) is still there as tail? No.\n\nWhen growing, after head moves to food, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays.\n\nBefore move: positions [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] head at (4,1), tail at (4,5)? Indices: 0:(4,1), 1:(4,2), 2:(4,3), 3:(4,4), 4:(5,4), 5:(5,5), 6:(4,5) tail at (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,1) and eat: head to (5,1), then body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and since eaten, no tail movement, so (4,5) remains, but it's not connected? The snake grows by adding a new segment at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment stays.\n\nSo positions: head (5,1), then segments (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail (4,5). But (5,5) to (4,5) is connected, yes.\n\nSo body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nNow head at (5,1), direction right (since moved right).\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- Down: (5,0) wall, invalid\n\n- Left: (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by body segment, index 1? Positions: 0:head (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (4,2), etc. So (4,1) is body, moving left to (4,1) would collide with body.\n\n- Right: (6,1) - x=6, which is not wall? x=7 wall, x=6 should be valid, but is it free? No snake there, so might be free.\n\n- Up: (5,2) - is it free? (5,2) not occupied, should be free.\n\nCannot move down or left effectively.\n\nSo possible: right to (6,1) or up to (5,2).\n\nBut moving right to (6,1): x=6, y=1.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the area might be tight.\n\nFor example, after eating both foods, snake is around the bottom left, with walls and obstacle.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nSo the body is forming a sort of loop or something, but not really.\n\n(4,1) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (4,5), so it's like a C shape or something.\n\nFrom head (5,1), if I go up to (5,2), that might be ok.\n\n(5,2) is free, I assume.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go left, right, up, down? Direction would be up.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nBack to turn 10, I have another choice: move left to (3,4) instead of down.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 10: move left to (3,4)\n\nThen new head at (3,4), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail (3,5) removed\n\nPositions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nNow, from (3,4), possible moves: direction left.\n\nCannot move right (reverse).\n\nUp: (3,5) - but (3,5) is not occupied now? After move, positions: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), so (3,5) is free? Before, tail was (3,5), but after move, it's removed, so (3,5) is free.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), y=5, x=3.\n\nBut is it within bounds? x=3, y=5, not wall, no obstacle, so free.\n\nDown: (3,3) - should be free.\n\nLeft: (2,4) - should be free.\n\nNow, food at (4,2) and (5,1).\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), which from (3,4) is down-right or something.\n\nI could go down to (3,3), then to (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) is south.\n\nAlso, (5,1) is southeast.\n\nLife span: (4,2) has 8 turns, (5,1) has 10, so both have time.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,5).\n\nAfter moving left to (3,4), tail at (4,5).\n\nNow, is there food on tail? No.\n\nBut later, if I eat food, tail might have food or something.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might block paths.\n\nPerhaps going left to (3,4) opens more space.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go down to (3,3), for example.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go down to (3,2) or right to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is above the obstacle (3,1), so (3,2) should be free.\n\nThen from (3,2) I can go down? (3,1) is obstacle, so cannot, only left, right, up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is food.\n\nSo I could go from (3,4) down to (3,3), then right to (4,3), then down to (4,2) to eat.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 10: move left to (3,4)\n\nPositions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 11: move down to (3,3)  // assuming (3,3) free\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)  // tail (4,5) removed? After move: head to (3,3), body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail was (4,5) removed, so positions [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] tail at (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is tail.\n\nNow from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\n(4,3) is free? Yes.\n\nThen turn 12: move right to (4,3)\n\nPositions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)  // tail (5,5) removed, so [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)] tail at (5,4)\n\nNow from (4,3), I can move down to (4,2) to eat.\n\nTurn 13: move down to (4,2), eat food.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)  // since eaten, tail not removed, so (5,4) remains, positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)] length 6.\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow, I have (5,1) food to eat.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move down to (4,1) or right to (5,2), etc.\n\nIf I move down to (4,1), then from (4,1) only right to (5,1) to eat, as before.\n\nThen similar situation.\n\nBut in this case, the snake is more to the left.\n\nNow, compare to the first plan.\n\nIn first plan, by going down immediately, I eat (4,2) on turn 11, and (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nIn second plan, going left first, I eat (4,2) on turn 13, later.\n\nTurn 10 move left, turn 11 down to (3,3), turn 12 right to (4,3), turn 13 down to (4,2) eat, so turn 13.\n\nWhereas in first plan, eat on turn 11.\n\nSo earlier food, better for score, but need to consider survival.\n\nIn both cases, I end up at (4,1) or (5,1) with a long snake.\n\nBut in the area, after eating both, the snake is coiled, and space is limited.\n\nFor example, after first plan, positions around (4,1) to (4,5) and (5,4),(5,5), so the cells like (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), etc. might be free.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,1), so bottom left is blocked.\n\nAlso, walls at borders.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going to (4,1) which might be a dead end.\n\nIn the first plan, when I go to (4,1), I have to go to (5,1), then from (5,1) I can go to (6,1) or (5,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,2), then I can explore right or up.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAnother food? Only two foods, both positive.\n\nBut after eating them, I need to survive and find more food, but no more food mentioned, so I need to stay alive until more food spawns, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so I think for this planning, we only have the given foods.\n\nThe goal is to eat the foods and survive.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is good.\n\nBut after eating both, the snake is longer, and in a corner, might be risky.\n\nFor example, in the position after eating (5,1), with head at (5,1), body to (4,1), etc., as before.\n\nIf I go to (6,1), then from (6,1), I can go up to (6,2), then to (6,3), etc., which might be open.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,2), I can go to (5,3), (6,2), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid size: 6x6 playable area minus obstacle, so 36-1=35 cells, snake length 7 after both foods, so 28 free cells, plenty of space.\n\nBut the snake position might block paths.\n\nSpecifically, in the first plan, after eating both, snake occupies (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — that's 8 cells? Length 7: head and 6 body, but positions include head and body.\n\nLength 7 means 7 cells occupied.\n\nIn my earlier, after eating second food: head (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)? In first plan, when I ate (5,1) at turn 13, positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) and tail is (5,5)? Let's list:\n\nAfter eating at (5,1): before move, head at (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — that's 7 segments: indices 0 to 6.\n\nAfter move to (5,1) and eat: head (5,1), then body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and since growth, (4,5) remains, so 8 segments: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nOccupied cells: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFree cells include (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,3), (5,2), (2,4), etc. Many free.\n\nFrom head (5,1), I can go to (6,1) or (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free, as per above.\n\nThen to (5,3), etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly, in the other plan.\n\nBut in the second plan, when I go left first, I eat later, but I have more space initially.\n\nBut since foods have long life, I can take my time.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner might be better, but the score is the same whenever I eat, as long as within life span.\n\nBut eating earlier might allow me to be ready for new food, but no new food mentioned.\n\nPerhaps for survival, not rushing to food might be better.\n\nAnother risk: the food at (4,2) might be under the body or something, but it's not, as we saw.\n\nOr tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving to (4,3) on turn 10, then to (4,2) on turn 11, but when I move to (4,2), the tail is at (4,5), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nThen from (4,2), instead of going down to (4,1), I could go right to (5,2), then to (5,1) to eat.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom (4,2) after eating (4,2), positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] direction down.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move right to (5,2), since not opposite.\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nTurn 12: move right to (5,2)\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)  // tail (4,5) removed, so [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] tail at (5,5)\n\nDirection right.\n\nNow from (5,2), I can move down to (5,1) to eat the food.\n\n(5,1) is below.\n\nTurn 13: move down to (5,1), eat.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)  // tail not removed, so (5,5) remains, positions [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] length 7.\n\nDirection down.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can move left to (4,1) or right to (6,1), etc.\n\n(4,1) might be free, or (6,1).\n\nThen I have space to move.\n\nIn this case, I didn't go to (4,1), so no dead end.\n\nAnd I ate both foods by turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, in the first subplan, when I went to (4,1), I still could go out.\n\nBut this way, from (5,2) to (5,1), I avoid being stuck at (4,1).\n\nSo better.\n\nNow, back to turn 10 choice: if I move down to (4,3) on turn 10, then on turn 11 to (4,2) eat, turn 12 to (5,2), turn 13 to (5,1) eat.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go to (6,1) or up to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, occupied, so only left to (4,1) if free, or right to (6,1), or down invalid.\n\n(4,1) might be free, so I can go left to (4,1) or right to (6,1).\n\nIf I go to (6,1), then to (6,2), etc.\n\nGood.\n\nIf on turn 10 I move left to (3,4), I can still reach the foods but later.\n\nFor example, turn 10 left to (3,4), turn 11 down to (3,3), turn 12 right to (4,3), turn 13 down to (4,2) eat, then from (4,2) I can go to (5,2) on turn 14, then to (5,1) on turn 15 eat.\n\nBut later, and (4,2) life span 8 from turn 10, so on turn 13 it is still there (turns 10 to 17), similarly (5,1) to turn 19.\n\nBut eating on turn 15 is fine, but I might miss opportunities, but no other food.\n\nSince no rush, but for efficiency, eating sooner might be better to free space or something.\n\nBut in terms of score, same.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize score, so eating both is necessary, and surviving.\n\nPerhaps moving to (3,4) first allows me to have a better path.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nInitially, tail at (3,5).\n\nAfter moving left to (3,4), tail moves to (4,5) or something.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) is close to the obstacle, but not an issue.\n\nI think moving directly towards the closer food is fine.\n\nBut (4,2) is closer from head.\n\nDistance: from (4,4) to (4,2) is 2 steps down, to (5,1) is |4-5| + |4-1| =1+3=4 steps.\n\nSo (4,2) is closer.\n\nMoreover, if I go left to (3,4), I am farther from both.\n\n(3,4) to (4,2) is |3-4| + |4-2| =1+2=3 steps, same as from (4,4) to (4,2) is 2 steps? (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2), 2 moves.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (4,2): (3,4) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2), 3 moves, or (3,4) to (4,4) but occupied, not possible directly, so at least 3 moves.\n\nSo better to go down first.\n\nAlso, for long-term, after eating, I can move to the right side where there is more space.\n\nFor example, the left side has the obstacle at (3,1), so less space.\n\nWhereas right side, x=5,6 y=1,2,3 etc. are free.\n\nIn the snake positions, (5,4) and (5,5) are occupied, but (5,3), (5,2), (6,4), etc. free.\n\nSo after eating, moving right or up is better.\n\nIn the plan with going to (5,2) then (5,1), I am at (5,1), then I can go to (6,1) or (5,2) but occupied, so to (6,1) then up.\n\nIf I go to (4,1), it might be tight, but possible.\n\nBut (4,1) is adjacent to obstacle and wall, so riskier.\n\nTherefore, the plan to go to (5,2) before (5,1) is better.\n\nSo for turn 10, move down to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 11, move down to (4,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 12, move right to (5,2).\n\nThen turn 13, move down to (5,1) eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 14, from (5,1), I need to move.\n\nDirection down.\n\nPossible moves: left to (4,1) or right to (6,1) or up to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, occupied, and direction down, moving up is reverse, invalid.\n\nDown to (5,0) wall invalid.\n\nSo only left or right.\n\n(4,1) is free? In positions after eating (5,1): head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — and tail? Positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — 7 segments, tail at (5,5).\n\n(4,1) is not occupied, so I can move left to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is free, move right.\n\nIf I move left to (4,1), then from (4,1), only right to (5,1) but occupied, or up to (4,2) occupied, or down invalid, left invalid (obstacle or wall).\n\n(4,1): down (4,0) wall, left (3,1) obstacle, up (4,2) occupied by body, right (5,1) occupied by head? After moving to (4,1), but currently at (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), if I move left to (4,1), that is free, so I go to (4,1), then from (4,1), as before, only possible move is right to (5,1), but (5,1) is now occupied by body? After moving to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — tail (5,5) removed? When moving, if no food, tail moves.\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1) move left to (4,1)\n\nSince no food, tail moves, so new positions: head (4,1), then body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)  // tail (5,5) removed, so positions [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] tail at (5,4)\n\nDirection left.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: down invalid, left invalid (obstacle), up to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by body segment, index 3? Positions: 0:head (4,1), 1:(5,1), 2:(5,2), 3:(4,2), 4:(4,3), 5:(4,4), 6:(5,4) tail.\n\nSo (4,2) is index 3, body, moving up to (4,2) would collide.\n\nRight to (5,1) but (5,1) is index 1, body, collide.\n\nNo valid moves! Stuck and die.\n\nOh, big problem.\n\nIf I go to (4,1) from (5,1), I get stuck.\n\nTherefore, I must not go to (4,1); instead, from (5,1), I should go right to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), I can go up to (6,2), etc., which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, after eating at (5,1) on turn 13, at (5,1), direction down, I should move right to (6,1) on turn 14.\n\nThen positions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)  // tail (5,5) removed? Before move: head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,1) no food: head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)  // tail (5,5) removed, so positions [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] tail at (5,4)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen I can go up to (6,2) or down invalid, etc.\n\n(6,2) free, move up, and so on.\n\nNo problem.\n\nTherefore, in the plan, after turn 13 at (5,1), I need to move right, not left.\n\nBut for the planning, I only need to output actions for a few turns, say 5 turns, from turn 10.\n\nThe answer format should be for turn 10,11,12,13,14 or something.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nProbably for a few turns, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 moves.\n\nCurrent turn t=10.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nIn the plan: turn 10: down to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: down to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 12: right to (5,2)\n\nTurn 13: down to (5,1) eat\n\nTurn 14: right to (6,1)\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut turn 14 is included.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 12 move to (5,2), which is fine.\n\nCould I go to the other food first? (5,1) is farther, so not efficient.\n\nPerhaps from turn 10, move down is best.\n\nTo confirm, if I move left on turn 10, to (3,4), then I need more moves to reach food.\n\nFor example, turn 10: left to (3,4)\n\nTurn 11: down to (3,3)\n\nTurn 12: right to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: down to (4,2) eat\n\nThen from (4,2), on turn 14, I can move right to (5,2), then turn 15 down to (5,1) eat.\n\nBut turn 14 and 15 are later, and for output, I need up to turn 14, which is move to (5,2) or something.\n\nBut I eat later.\n\nSince both plans are possible, but the down-first plan eats the first food earlier and both by turn 13.\n\nIn down-first, I eat on turn 11 and 13.\n\nIn left-first, eat on turn 13 and 15.\n\nSo down-first is faster.\n\nMoreover, in down-first, after eating, I can move away from the crowded area.\n\nTherefore, I think moving down on turn 10 is better.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn 10: move down (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 11: move down (to (4,2), eat)\n\nTurn 12: move right (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 13: move down (to (5,1), eat)\n\nThen turn 14: move right (to (6,1))\n\nIn turn 12, moving to (5,2) is right from (4,2), which is perpendicular, not opposite, since direction was down, moving right is fine.\n\nSimilarly, turn 13 down to (5,1), direction down.\n\nTurn 14 right to (6,1).\n\nAll safe.\n\nI could on turn 12 move down to (4,1) but that leads to risk, so better not.\n\nIn turn 12, from (4,2), after eating, I moved right to (5,2), but I could move left to (3,2) or something, but (3,2) might be ok, but then to reach (5,1) I need to go via (4,2) or something, but (4,2) is body, so not efficient.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) move left to (3,2), then from (3,2) I can go down? (3,1) obstacle, so only left, right, up.\n\nThen to (4,2) occupied, not possible.\n\nSo to get to (5,1), I need to go to (5,2) first or something.\n\nBut from (3,2), I can go to (4,2) but occupied, or to (3,3), etc., not direct to (5,1).\n\nSo better to go right to (5,2) directly.\n\nTherefore, the plan is solid.\n\nSo for output:\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be \"U/D/L/R\" or with direction.\n\n\"action ∈ {U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)}\"\n\nSo I need to write the words.\n\nAlso, in the boxed.\n\nNow, for thinking ahead, I have up to turn 14, which is 5 turns from turn 10? Turn 10,11,12,13,14: that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn t1 to t1+4, but since t1=10, turn 10 to 14.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. The key priorities are:\n- Eat the closer food at (4,2) first, as it is only 2 moves away, ensuring it is consumed before its life span expires (it disappears after turn 17).\n- Then eat the food at (5,1), which has a longer life span (disappears after turn 19), by moving efficiently to avoid dead ends.\n- Avoid the risky area near (4,1) and the obstacle at (3,1) to prevent trapping the snake.\n- After eating both foods, move to open spaces (e.g., right to (6,1)) to ensure survival and flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 10)\n- **Snake head**: (4,4), direction left (L).\n- **Snake body**: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] (length 5, tail at (3,5)).\n- **Food**: \n  - (4,2): value +1, life span 8 (can be eaten until turn 17).\n  - (5,1): value +1, life span 10 (can be eaten until turn 19).\n- **Walls and obstacles**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (3,1).\n- **Possible moves from (4,4)**:\n  - Up (U) to (4,5): Occupied by body (segment at (4,5)), deadly collision.\n  - Down (D) to (4,3): Free and safe.\n  - Left (L) to (3,4): Free and safe.\n  - Right (R) to (5,4): Occupied by body and opposite direction (invalid due to no instant reverse).\n\nOnly down (D) or left (L) are safe immediate moves. Moving down (D) is preferred to reach (4,2) faster.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 10-14)\n1. **Turn 10: Move down (D)** to (4,3).  \n   - Why: Moves toward (4,2) efficiently. Snake now at [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)], direction down. Tail at (4,5). (4,2) is now 1 move away.\n\n2. **Turn 11: Move down (D)** to (4,2) and eat the positive food.  \n   - Why: Eats (4,2) for +1 score, increasing length to 6. Snake now at [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)], direction down. (5,1) is the next target.\n\n3. **Turn 12: Move right (R)** to (5,2).  \n   - Why: Avoids the dead end at (4,1) and positions for (5,1). Snake now at [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)], direction right. Tail at (5,5).\n\n4. **Turn 13: Move down (D)** to (5,1) and eat the positive food.  \n   - Why: Eats (5,1) for +1 score, increasing length to 7. Snake now at [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)], direction down.\n\n5. **Turn 14: Move right (R)** to (6,1).  \n   - Why: Avoids getting stuck near the obstacle and walls. Moving left to (4,1) would trap the snake (no valid moves from (4,1)). Moving right to (6,1) opens space for future exploration. Snake now at [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)], direction right.\n\n### Long-Term Survival Considerations\n- After turn 14, the snake is at (6,1) with direction right, and the grid has ample free space (e.g., (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc.). This allows safe maneuvering to avoid collisions and wait for new food spawns.\n- Both foods are eaten by turn 13, maximizing the score (+2) with minimal risk.\n- The plan avoids:\n  - Tail reward danger (no food on tail).\n  - Body/wall collisions.\n  - Dead ends (e.g., not moving to (4,1) on turn 12 or 14).\n- Life spans are respected: (4,2) eaten on turn 11 (within 8 turns), (5,1) eaten on turn 13 (within 10 turns).\n\nThis strategy prioritizes immediate food collection while ensuring the snake remains in a flexible position for survival beyond turn 14.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 11: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 12: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 13: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 14: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 11, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall corner, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Walls include borders and internal obstacles. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those entire lines are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,3), then body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). So let's list the snake segments:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (4,5)  // this is the tail\n\nSnake has 5 segments, so length 5. Head direction is Down, which means it was moving down to reach (4,3). Since head is at (4,3) and direction is D, that means it came from above, so previous position was (4,4)? No.\n\nSnake positions are given in order: head first, then body. So [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]. Head is at (4,3), and it's moving Down. Moving Down means decreasing y, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nIn the movement definitions:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — so y increases upwards.\n\n- D: (x, y-1) — y decreases downwards.\n\n- L: (x-1, y)\n\n- R: (x+1, y)\n\nAnd walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Since U increases y, so y=7 is top row.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo grid: (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nNow food:\n\n- Food at (4,2) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- Food at (5,1) with life span 9, value +1\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1.\n\nLife span: for (4,2) it's 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 11, life span 7 means it will disappear after turn 11 + 7 - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo if at turn t, food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, disappearing at the end of turn t + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n\nTypically, if at turn t, countdown is L, it means after L turns, it will be gone. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1; if L-1 >0, it's still there, else gone.\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N turns including current.\n\nLet's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will not be present at turn t + L.\n\nFor example, if L=1 at turn t, it will be eaten or disappear after this turn, so during turn t, it can be eaten, but after turn t, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, if L=2, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, gone by turn t+2.\n\nIn this case, turn 11, food at (4,2) has life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning it can be eaten from turn 11 to turn 17 (since after 7 turns, turn 18 it's gone). Turn 11 + 7 -1 =17? Let's calculate.\n\n- Turn 11: life span 7, countdown decreases to 6 after turn 11.\n\n- After turn 11: life span 6\n\n- Turn 12: decreases to 5\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 17: life span decreases to 0, so at turn 18, it's gone.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns 11 through 17.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,1) life span 9, can be eaten turns 11 to 19.\n\nBoth have value +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,3), direction Down. Down is (x, y-1), so moving downwards.\n\nCurrent possible moves: since direction is Down, I can move Down, Left, or Right, but not Up, because that would be reverse. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is Down, so opposite is Up. So I cannot move Up on this turn.\n\nPossible moves: Down, Left, Right.\n\nNow, let's see the grid positions.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo let's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nRows y from 1 to 6, bottom to top? y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Since D is y-1, so y decreases down, so y=1 is bottom row, y=6 is top row? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is below bottom, y=7 above top, so playable y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nSimilarly x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,1), which is bottom row, x=3.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (5,1).\n\n(4,2): x=4, y=2\n\n(5,1): x=5, y=1\n\nNow snake head at (4,3), which is above (4,2).\n\nIf snake moves Down to (4,2), it can eat the food there, since (4,2) has food.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n\nAlso, check for tail reward danger.\n\nTail is at (4,5). Head is at (4,3), so not adjacent to tail directly. Adjacent means neighboring cells.\n\nHead at (4,3), possible adjacent cells: (4,2) down, (4,4) up, but (4,4) is body, (3,3) left, (5,3) right.\n\n(4,4) is body segment, so if I move up, I die immediately.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,3) or right to (5,3), need to see what's there.\n\n(3,3) should be empty, I think.\n\nList all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo occupied: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nWalls: borders and (3,1)\n\nFood: (4,2), (5,1)\n\nNow, for head at (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- Down (D) to (4,2): this has food, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows to length 6.\n\n- Left (L) to (3,3): should be empty? (3,3) not in snake, not wall, not food listed, so empty.\n\n- Right (R) to (5,3): similarly, empty? (5,3) not occupied.\n\n- Up (U) to (4,4): but (4,4) is body, so collision, death. Also, cannot move up because it's reverse? Current direction is Down, so moving Up is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible actions: D, L, R.\n\nNow, if I move D to (4,2), I eat the food, snake grows. New head at (4,2), and tail stays? When you eat, length increases, so tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food, and the tail doesn't move, so you grow by one.\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,2) which has food, so after move, head is at (4,2), and the previous head becomes body, so new positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail (4,5) remains? Let's see the movement.\n\nNormally, when moving without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail moves away from its current position.\n\nBut when eating, head moves to food, but the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays, and new segment is added, so snake grows.\n\nThe rules say: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nAlso, for movement, \"the tail will also move forward\" when not eating, I think.\n\nFrom the description: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nThis implies that when moving to a cell that was tail, if no food, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nBut if there is food on tail, and you eat it, there might be danger.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving Down to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) has food, so I eat it. After eating, snake grows: new head at (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and (4,5) remains as tail? No.\n\nPositions: before move, snake: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2), since it ate food, the tail does not move, so new positions: head (4,2), then the previous head (4,3) becomes second segment, and so on, up to (4,5) as tail, but since we ate, we add a new segment where the tail was? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake growth: when you eat, you move the head to the food cell, and you do not remove the tail segment, so the snake increases in length by one. The new tail is the old tail.\n\nFor example, before move: segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., St (tail)\n\nAfter moving to a food cell: new head at new position, S0 moves to new head, but since it ate, S0's old position becomes part of body, and tail stays, so new segments: new head, then old head, then S1, ..., St. So length increases by one.\n\nIn this case:\n\nBefore: positions: H: (4,3), B1: (4,4), B2: (5,4), B3: (5,5), T: (4,5)\n\nAfter moving D to (4,2) and eating: new H: (4,2), then B1: old H (4,3), B2: old B1 (4,4), B3: old B2 (5,4), B4: old B3 (5,5), and new tail: old T (4,5) stays. So snake now: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] with head at (4,2), tail at (4,5).\n\nNow, is there a problem? Head at (4,2), which is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (4,2); (4,2) and (4,5) are three cells apart, so no issue.\n\nBut let's check if (4,2) is under body? Before moving, (4,2) was not occupied, it had food, so after moving, it's fine.\n\nNow, after this move, what is the head direction? I moved Down, so new direction is Down.\n\nNow, life span of food: after turn 11, food at (4,2) is eaten, so gone. Food at (5,1) still there, life span decreases to 8? At turn 11, we consume the food, so it's removed.\n\nLife span countdown decreases after the turn, but since it's eaten, it's gone.\n\nFor (5,1), life span was 9 at turn 11, after turn 11, it decreases to 8, so still there for turn 12.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut I should consider all options.\n\nOption 1: Move Down to (4,2), eat food, grow to length 6.\n\nThen snake: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection Down.\n\nPossible next moves from (4,2): D, L, R. Cannot U (reverse).\n\nDown to (4,1): what is (4,1)? y=1, x=4. Is it wall? Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1) is playable, but is there obstacle? Internal obstacle at (3,1), not (4,1), so (4,1) should be empty.\n\nBut food at (5,1), not (4,1).\n\nLeft to (3,2): empty?\n\nRight to (5,2): empty?\n\n(5,2) not occupied.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter eating, positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (4,1) is below, empty.\n\n(3,2) left, empty.\n\n(5,2) right, empty.\n\nAlso, (4,2) has no food now.\n\nIf I move down to (4,1), that is empty, so no eat, snake moves: head to (4,1), then body to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), tail to (5,5)? When not eating, tail moves away.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), no food, so head to (4,1), body: old H position (4,2) becomes new body, then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), and tail from (5,5)? Let's sequence.\n\nBefore move: segments: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), B4(5,5), T(4,5)? No, after growth, positions: let's index.\n\nAfter turn 11: snake: pos0: (4,2) head, pos1: (4,3), pos2: (4,4), pos3: (5,4), pos4: (5,5), pos5: (4,5) tail.\n\nNow, if move down to (4,1), no food there, so new head at (4,1), then new body: old head position (4,2), then pos1 (4,3), pos2 (4,4), pos3 (5,4), pos4 (5,5), and tail pos5 (4,5) is not moved to, so it is removed? When not eating, the tail moves away from its position.\n\nStandard: when moving to empty cell, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo from above: new head at (4,1), then the first body segment moves to old head position (4,2), second body to old first body (4,3), third to old second body (4,4), fourth to old third body (5,4), fifth to old fourth body (5,5), and the old tail (4,5) is left empty.\n\nBut we have six segments: head and five body/tail.\n\nPositions: after growth, we have six cells: let's say cell A: (4,2) head, cell B: (4,3), cell C: (4,4), cell D: (5,4), cell E: (5,5), cell F: (4,5) tail.\n\nWhen moving to new head position, say (4,1), no food.\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nNew body1: old head position, (4,2)\n\nNew body2: old body1 position, (4,3)\n\nNew body3: old body2 position, (4,4)\n\nNew body4: old body3 position, (5,4)\n\nNew body5: old body4 position, (5,5)\n\nAnd old tail position (4,5) is now empty; no new tail from it.\n\nSo snake now: head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nLength still 6, since we didn't eat.\n\nTail is now (5,5).\n\nBack to option 1: at turn 11, move D to (4,2), eat food, grow to len 6.\n\nThen at turn 12, from (4,2) head, direction Down, I can move D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2).\n\n(4,1) is empty, as above.\n\n(3,2) is empty.\n\n(5,2) is empty.\n\nBut there is food at (5,1), which is below (5,2)? (5,1) is at y=1, x=5.\n\nIf I move to (5,2), then I can go down to (5,1) later.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves at turn 11.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (4,2), eat food, score +1, snake grows.\n\nThen snake at: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) with head at (4,2) dir Down.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is empty, no food, so move without eating. Snake moves: head to (3,3), then body to old head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail (4,5) moves away? Before move: positions H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(5,4), B3(5,5), T(4,5)\n\nMove L to (3,3), no food, so new head (3,3), new body1: old H (4,3), new body2: old B1 (4,4), new body3: old B2 (5,4), new tail: old B3 (5,5), and old T (4,5) vacated.\n\nSo snake now: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] with head at (3,3) dir Left (since moved left).\n\nLength still 5.\n\nOption 3: Move R to (5,3)\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) empty, no food, move: head to (5,3), body to (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), tail to (5,5), old tail (4,5) vacated.\n\nSnake: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] head at (5,3) dir Right.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate which is better for long-term survival and scoring.\n\nFirst, consider moving Down to eat the food at (4,2).\n\nAfter that, at turn 12, head at (4,2) dir Down.\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\n(4,1) is empty, as before.\n\n(3,2) empty.\n\n(5,2) empty.\n\nAlso, food at (5,1) is still there.\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), no food, so snake moves to (4,1) head, body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), tail (5,5) as before.\n\nThen from (4,1), dir Down, I can move D, but y=1, D to (4,0) is wall, y=0 is wall, so cannot move down. Can move L or R, but not U (reverse).\n\nL to (3,1): but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nR to (5,1): (5,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nIf I move R to (5,1) from (4,1), that would be moving right, but let's see.\n\nFrom head at (4,1), after moving down to it, direction Down.\n\nMoving right to (5,1): that is possible, and (5,1) has food, so I eat it.\n\nBut is (5,1) under the body? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), snake: H(4,1), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nIf I move R to (5,1), which has food, so eat: new head (5,1), then body: old H (4,1), B1 (4,2), B2 (4,3), B3 (4,4), B4 (5,4), and tail (5,5) stays, so snake grows to len 6: positions (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)? No.\n\nSegments: new head (5,1), new body1: (4,1), new body2: (4,2), new body3: (4,3), new body4: (4,4), new body5: (5,4), new tail: (5,5)  so seven positions? Length was 6 before eating? After turn 11, we had len 6, then after turn 12 move to (4,1) no eat, len still 6, then move to (5,1) and eat, so len becomes 7.\n\nBut let's not jump.\n\nBack to turn 12 options after eating at (4,2).\n\nIf at turn 12 I move directly to (5,1) from (4,2)? From (4,2), I can move R to (5,2) first, then to (5,1).\n\nFrom (4,2), I cannot move directly to (5,1) because not adjacent; adjacent are (4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (4,3) but (4,3) is body.\n\nSo from (4,2), to reach (5,1), I need to go to (5,2) first or (4,1) then (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is at (5,1), which is bottom row.\n\nNow, another thing: tail reward danger.\n\nHead at (4,2), tail is at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nBut after some moves, it might be.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,1) has life span 9, so plenty of time, but it might be risky to go there because of the obstacle at (3,1) and borders.\n\nLet's consider not eating the first food.\n\nFor example, at turn 11, move L to (3,3).\n\nThen snake: head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail, dir Left.\n\nThen I can go to other places.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (5,3), head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail, dir Right.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go down to (5,2) or up to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, so cannot, or left to (4,3) body, cannot, or right to (6,3) but x=6, which is playable, x=7 wall, so (6,3) empty.\n\nBut let's think about the food.\n\nFood at (4,2) has life span 7, so it will be there until turn 17, and at (5,1) until turn 19.\n\nBut the snake is near (4,2), so it might be easy to eat it now.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is coiled, with segments at (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), so it's like a C shape or something.\n\nHead at (4,3), if I don't eat, and move left or right, I might be able to uncoil or something.\n\nBut let's think about survival first.\n\nThe grid is small, 6x6 playable, with obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake length 5, so it occupies 5 cells.\n\nAvailable space: total cells 6*6=36 minus 1 obstacle minus 5 snake minus 2 food? Food are on cells, but can be eaten.\n\nAt turn 11, cells occupied: snake 5, walls borders and (3,1), but walls are not cells, so playable cells are 36.\n\nOccupied by snake: 5 cells.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (5,1), so two cells with food, so empty cells: 36 - 5 - 2 = 29? But the food cells are occupiable, but when empty, they are free.\n\nFor movement, we care about free cells.\n\nAt turn 11, before move, the cells: snake occupies (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFood at (4,2) and (5,1)\n\nObstacle at (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, not playable.\n\nOther cells free.\n\nIf I move to (4,2), I eat food, grow, so I occupy more space.\n\nIf I don't eat, I move to free cell.\n\nNow, for long-term, eating food increases length, which might make it harder to maneuver, but also more score.\n\nBut we need to maximize score, so eating is good, but avoid risks.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail at (4,5), head at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\nAfter some moves, it might be.\n\nBut let's simulate moving Down.\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2), eat, snake: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), B4(5,5), T(4,5)  len 6, dir Down.\n\nTurn 12: from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- D to (4,1): empty, no food. Move to (4,1), no eat, so snake moves: H to (4,1), B1 to (4,2), B2 to (4,3), B3 to (4,4), B4 to (5,4), T to (5,5)?  old T (4,5) vacated.\n\nPositions: new H(4,1), new B1(4,2), new B2(4,3), new B3(4,4), new B4(5,4), new T(5,5)  and old T (4,5) gone.\n\nSnake: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] head (4,1) dir Down.\n\nNow at (4,1), dir Down, but y=1, cannot move down to (4,0) wall. Can move L to (3,1) but (3,1) wall, cannot. Or R to (5,1) which has food, so I can move R to (5,1).\n\nMove R to (5,1): since (5,1) has food, eat it. Grow to len 7.\n\nNew head (5,1), body: old H (4,1), old B1 (4,2), old B2 (4,3), old B3 (4,4), old B4 (5,4), old T (5,5) stays, so new positions: H(5,1), B1(4,1), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), B5(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nLen 7.\n\nDirection Right, since moved right.\n\nNow, from here, head at (5,1), dir Right.\n\nPossible moves: R to (6,1), U to (5,2), or L to (4,1) but (4,1) is now body (B1), so cannot move left, collision. D not possible, y=1.\n\nSo can move R to (6,1) or U to (5,2).\n\n(6,1) is empty, (5,2) is empty? (5,2) not occupied, should be free.\n\nIf I move R to (6,1), no food, move: H to (6,1), body to (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut then I might be stuck in the bottom row.\n\nMove U to (5,2), no food, move to (5,2), then body to (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nAfter eating at (5,1), tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to head.\n\nBut the body is now from (5,1) to (5,5) with some turns.\n\nPositions: H(5,1), B1(4,1), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), B5(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nSo it's a bit messy.\n\nHead at (5,1), if I move U to (5,2), no food, so move: H to (5,2), B1 to (5,1), B2 to (4,1), B3 to (4,2), B4 to (4,3), B5 to (4,4), T to (5,4)  old T (5,5) vacated.\n\nSnake: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] head (5,2) dir Up.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut the snake is getting longer, and the grid has limited space.\n\nI could have avoided eating the first food to keep smaller size.\n\nLet's consider not eating at turn 11.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,3) at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: move L to (3,3), no eat, snake: H(3,3), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), T(5,5)  dir Left. (old tail (4,5) gone)\n\nPositions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nHead (3,3) dir Left.\n\nThen turn 12: from (3,3), possible moves: L, U, D, but not R (reverse).\n\nL to (2,3): x=2, y=3, should be playable, since x=1 to 6.\n\nU to (3,4): y=4, up.\n\nD to (3,2): down.\n\nR to (4,3) but body, cannot.\n\nSo L, U, D.\n\n(2,3) empty, (3,4) empty, (3,2) empty.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (5,1) still available.\n\nI could go towards the food.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved R at turn 11 to (5,3).\n\nTurn 11: move R to (5,3), no eat, snake: H(5,3), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), T(5,5)  dir Right.\n\nThen turn 12: from (5,3), moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4) body, cannot, D to (5,2), L to (4,3) body, cannot.\n\nSo only R to (6,3) or D to (5,2).\n\n(6,3) empty, (5,2) empty.\n\nThen I can go to (5,2), then to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut let's compare the options.\n\nI am considering the risk of moving Down first.\n\nIf I move Down at turn 11, I eat the food at (4,2), but then at (4,1), I am at the bottom row, with wall below, obstacle at (3,1), so I can only move right to (5,1) to eat the other food, which forces me to eat both quickly, but then I have a longer snake in a corner, which might be dangerous for future moves.\n\nFor example, after eating both, snake is around the bottom left, with length 7, and the grid has obstacle, so less space to move.\n\nThe food at (4,2) has only 7 life span, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear later, but I can eat it within 7 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) has 9, plenty of time.\n\nSo perhaps I should not eat at turn 11, and instead move left or right to have more space.\n\nLet's think about the tail.\n\nTail is at (4,5), which is the top part.\n\nIf I move down, I leave the tail, so the body might block.\n\nBut in the move down, when I eat, the tail stays, so it might be ok.\n\nAnother idea: if I move left or right, I can go to the food later with better position.\n\nFor example, at turn 11, move R to (5,3).\n\nThen snake: H(5,3), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), T(5,5)  dir Right.\n\nTurn 12: from (5,3), I can move D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\nSuppose I move D to (5,2), no food, so move: H to (5,2), B1 to (5,3), B2 to (4,3), B3 to (4,4), T to (5,4)  old T (5,5) gone.\n\nSnake: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] head (5,2) dir Down.\n\nThen turn 13: from (5,2), I can move D to (5,1) which has food, so eat it.\n\nMove to (5,1), eat, grow: new H(5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) and tail stays? Old tail was (5,4), so new positions: H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(5,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4)  len 6.\n\nDirection Down.\n\nThen from here, I can move R to (6,1) or U to (5,3) but (5,3) is body B2, so cannot, or L to (4,1) but (4,1) empty? y=1, x=4.\n\n(4,1) is empty, but is it accessible? From (5,1), move L to (4,1), no food, so move: H to (4,1), body to (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), tail to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I still have the food at (4,2) which is above.\n\nIn this case, I ate the (5,1) food at turn 13, but (4,2) is still there until turn 17.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) to eat it.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nAfter eating at (5,1) at turn 13, snake: H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(5,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4)  at turn 13.\n\nThen turn 14: from (5,1), dir Down, can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1) or U to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, cannot, D not possible.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nMove L to (4,1), no food, move: H to (4,1), B1 to (5,1), B2 to (5,2), B3 to (5,3), B4 to (4,3), T to (4,4)  old T (5,4) gone.\n\nSnake: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] head (4,1) dir Left (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 15: from (4,1), dir Left, can move L to (3,1) but (3,1) wall, cannot; U to (4,2) which has food; D not possible; R to (5,1) body, cannot.\n\nSo only U to (4,2).\n\nMove U to (4,2), eat food, grow: new H(4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), T(4,4)  but old tail (4,4), so new positions: H(4,2), B1(4,1), B2(5,1), B3(5,2), B4(5,3), B5(4,3), T(4,4)  len 7.\n\nDirection Up.\n\nThen I have eaten both foods, snake len 7.\n\nBut the body is coiled: from (4,2) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (4,4), so it's a loop, which might be risky for future moves.\n\nFor example, head at (4,2), body at (4,1), (5,1), etc., so moving U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body B5, collision; or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2) body, or D to (4,1) body.\n\nFrom (4,2), after eating, possible moves: U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, cannot; D to (4,1) body, cannot; L to (3,2), which is empty; R to (5,2) but (5,2) is body B3, so cannot move there.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,2).\n\nMove L to (3,2), no food, so move: H to (3,2), body to (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), tail to (4,3), old T (4,4) gone.\n\nSnake: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] head (3,2) dir Left.\n\nThen I can continue, but it's getting tight.\n\nIf at turn 11 I didn't eat, I might have more space.\n\nLet's consider moving Left at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: move L to (3,3), no eat, snake: H(3,3), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), T(5,5)  dir Left.\n\nTurn 12: from (3,3), move say D to (3,2), no food, move: H to (3,2), B1 to (3,3), B2 to (4,3), B3 to (4,4), T to (5,4)  old T (5,5) gone.\n\nSnake: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] head (3,2) dir Down.\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,2), can move D to (3,1) but (3,1) wall, cannot; L to (2,2); U to (3,3) body, cannot; R to (4,2) which has food.\n\nSo can move L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\nIf move R to (4,2), eat food, grow: new H(4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), T(5,4)  so positions: H(4,2), B1(3,2), B2(3,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4) len 6.\n\nDirection Right.\n\nThen from here, I can go to (5,1) later.\n\nBut (5,1) is below.\n\nFrom (4,2), head, dir Right, can move R to (5,2), U to (4,3) body, cannot, D to (4,1), L to (3,2) body, cannot.\n\nSo move R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\n(5,2) empty, (4,1) empty.\n\nIf move R to (5,2), no food, move: H to (5,2), body to (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), tail to (4,4)  old T (5,4) gone.\n\nSnake: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] head (5,2) dir Right.\n\nThen turn 14: from (5,2), can move R to (6,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1) which has food, L to (4,2) body, cannot.\n\nSo move R, U, or D to (5,1) to eat.\n\nMove D to (5,1), eat, grow: new H(5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), T(4,4)  so len 7.\n\nThen similar situation as before.\n\nBut in this case, I ate both foods later, but the snake is still long.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating one food to stay smaller.\n\nBut both are positive, so eating gives score.\n\nBut for survival, shorter snake is easier.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating is good if I can survive.\n\nBut in this small grid, with len 7, it might be hard to manuever.\n\nTotal free cells: 36 -1 obstacle =35 cells for snake to move.\n\nWith len 7, it occupies 7 cells, so 28 free, but it can work.\n\nBut there might be dead ends.\n\nFor example, the bottom row has the obstacle at (3,1), so cells (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are free, but (3,1) wall.\n\nSimilarly, other areas.\n\nBut let's go back to the initial choice.\n\nAnother option: at turn 11, move R to (5,3), then turn 12 move D to (5,2), then turn 13 move D to (5,1) to eat, as I had earlier.\n\nThen I have the food at (4,2) still, which I can eat later.\n\nAfter eating at (5,1) at turn 13, snake: H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(5,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4)  dir Down.\n\nThen I can move L to (4,1) at turn 14, as before, then U to (4,2) at turn 15 to eat.\n\nBut at turn 15, when I move U to (4,2), is there tail reward danger?\n\nAt that point, before moving, head at (4,1), tail at (4,4)? In my earlier sequence, when at (4,1), tail was at (4,4), and head at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\n(4,1) and (4,4) are not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,2), I eat, and tail is at (4,4), which is not adjacent to (4,2), so no problem.\n\nBut the body is there.\n\nIn all cases, I can eat both foods, but the snake gets longer.\n\nPerhaps I can eat only one and leave the other for later or never.\n\nBut both give +1 score, so I should eat both if possible.\n\nBut with life span, (4,2) disappears after turn 17, so I have time.\n\nNow, for the initial move, moving Down might be risky because it commits me to the bottom row with fewer options.\n\nMoving Left or Right gives more flexibility.\n\nLet's consider the food under body issue.\n\nFood at (4,2) is not under body, it's free.\n\nHead is at (4,3), food at (4,2), so I can move directly to it.\n\nSpecial cases: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on.\"\n\nBut here, (4,2) is not under body, it's free, so I can eat it directly.\n\nSimilarly for (5,1).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 11, if I move Down, I eat, grow, and the tail is at (4,5), which is far.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, so harder to turn.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, it's better to not grow too fast.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nLet's list the actions for 5 turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for turns 11,12,13,etc.\n\nBut I need to choose the first action.\n\nPrioritize survival.\n\nFrom head at (4,3), moving L to (3,3) or R to (5,3) might be safer because I stay in the center and have more options to go to food later.\n\nMoving D to (4,2) eats immediately, but then I am at edge.\n\nMoving R to (5,3) might be good because I can then go down to (5,2) and (5,1) to eat the other food, and (4,2) is still available.\n\nLet's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 11: move R to (5,3)  -- not eat, snake to (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) dir Right.\n\nTurn 12: move D to (5,2)  -- not eat, snake to (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) dir Down.\n\nTurn 13: move D to (5,1)  -- eat food at (5,1), grow to len 6: positions H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(5,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4) dir Down.\n\nNow, food at (4,2) still there, life span decreasing.\n\nFrom (5,1), dir Down, can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nMove L to (4,1) at turn 14: no food, move to (4,1), so snake: H(4,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(5,3), B4(4,3), T(4,4) dir Left.\n\nThen turn 15: from (4,1), dir Left, can only move U to (4,2) because L to (3,1) wall, D not possible, R to (5,1) body.\n\nMove U to (4,2), eat food, grow: new H(4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), T(4,4) so positions H(4,2), B1(4,1), B2(5,1), B3(5,2), B4(5,3), B5(4,3), T(4,4) len 7.\n\nThen as before, only can move L to (3,2).\n\nBut at this point, the snake is long, and I need to find a way out.\n\nFrom (4,2), after eating, I moved L to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,2), dir Left, can move L to (2,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1) wall, cannot.\n\nMove L to (2,2) or U to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) might be free or not, in this sequence, at turn 16, (3,3) should be free, since we moved away.\n\nIn the positions, after moving to (3,2), snake: H(3,2), B1(4,2), B2(4,1), B3(5,1), B4(5,2), B5(5,3), T(4,3)  from earlier.\n\nAfter turn 15: positions H(4,2), B1(4,1), B2(5,1), B3(5,2), B4(5,3), B5(4,3), T(4,4)\n\nThen move L to (3,2), no eat, so new H(3,2), new B1(4,2), new B2(4,1), new B3(5,1), new B4(5,2), new B5(5,3), new T(4,3)  old T (4,4) gone.\n\nSnake: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] head (3,2) dir Left.\n\nThen from (3,2), move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\n(3,3) empty, (2,2) empty.\n\nSay move U to (3,3), no food, move: H to (3,3), body to (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), tail to (5,3), etc.\n\nI can continue, but it's possible to survive.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved Down at turn 11, I might be in a similar situation.\n\nBut let's see if there's a better first move.\n\nWhat if at turn 11 I move L to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 12, move D to (3,2), then turn 13, move R to (4,2) to eat.\n\nTurn 11: move L to (3,3), no eat, snake: H(3,3), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), T(5,5) dir Left.\n\nTurn 12: move D to (3,2), no eat, snake: H(3,2), B1(3,3), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), T(5,4) dir Down.\n\nTurn 13: move R to (4,2), eat food, grow: new H(4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), T(5,4) so positions H(4,2), B1(3,2), B2(3,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4) len 6, dir Right.\n\nThen I have the food at (5,1) below.\n\nFrom (4,2), can move D to (4,1) or R to (5,2) or L to (3,2) body, cannot.\n\nMove D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf move D to (4,1), no food, move: H to (4,1), body to (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), tail to (4,4)  old T (5,4) gone.\n\nSnake: [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] head (4,1) dir Down.\n\nThen turn 15: from (4,1), move U to (4,2) body, cannot; L to (3,1) wall; R to (5,1) which has food.\n\nMove R to (5,1), eat, grow: new H(5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), T(4,4) so positions H(5,1), B1(4,1), B2(4,2), B3(3,2), B4(3,3), B5(4,3), T(4,4) len 7.\n\nThen similar.\n\nIn all cases, I end up with len 7 after eating both foods.\n\nBut if I don't eat one, I can have lower length, but I lose score.\n\nSince both foods are positive, I should eat both.\n\nNow for the first move, moving Down to eat immediately might be efficient for score, but moving Right allows me to eat the other food first and then come back.\n\nBut in terms of survival, both seem ok.\n\nBut let's check the tail position at the beginning.\n\nTail at (4,5), if I move Down, I leave it, but it will move eventually.\n\nAnother risk: when I move to (4,2), is there any danger?\n\n(4,2) is free, no collision.\n\nBut after eating, the body is at (4,3), which is above, so from (4,2), I cannot move up.\n\nBut I can move down, left, right.\n\nPerhaps moving Down is fine.\n\nBut to avoid being trapped, moving Right might be better.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet's look at the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction Down, so moving Down is consistent, moving Left or Right is turning.\n\nIn snake, turning might be better for manueverability.\n\nBut here, moving Down to eat is straightforward.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can choose to move Down.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nLet's define a sequence.\n\nSuppose at turn 11: move D to (4,2) eat food.\n\nTurn 12: from (4,2) dir Down, move R to (5,2)  no food, move to (5,2), so snake: H(5,2), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5) dir Right.\n\nTurn 13: from (5,2), dir Right, can move R to (6,2), D to (5,1) which has food, U to (5,3) but (5,3) might be free.\n\nIn positions, (5,3) not occupied, so U to (5,3) or D to (5,1) or R to (6,2).\n\nMove D to (5,1), eat food, grow: new H(5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), T(5,5) so positions H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), B5(5,4), T(5,5) len 7, dir Down.\n\nThen from (5,1), can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\n(4,1) empty, (6,1) empty.\n\nMove L to (4,1), no food, move: H to (4,1), body to (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail to (5,4)  old T (5,5) gone.\n\nSnake: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] head (4,1) dir Left.\n\nThen I can move U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, cannot; D not possible; L to (3,1) wall; R to (5,1) body, cannot. Only U and R are invalid, L wall, D wall, so no move? Head at (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) but occupied by body, L to (3,1) wall, R to (5,1) occupied by body, D to (4,0) wall. All moves invalid, snake dies!\n\nOh no! In this sequence, at turn 14, after moving to (4,1), the snake is trapped.\n\nPositions: before move at turn 13: H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), B5(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nAfter move L to (4,1) at turn 14: new H(4,1), new B1(5,1), new B2(5,2), new B3(4,2), new B4(4,3), new B5(4,4), new T(5,4)  old T (5,5) gone.\n\nNow cells: H(4,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(4,2), B4(4,3), B5(4,4), T(5,4)\n\nFrom (4,1), adjacent cells: U (4,2) is B3, occupied; D (4,0) wall; L (3,1) wall; R (5,1) is B1, occupied. No free cell, so collision or wall, death.\n\nSo in this sequence, if I move Down at turn 11, then Right at turn 12, then Down to eat at (5,1) at turn 13, then Left to (4,1) at turn 14, I die at turn 15.\n\nBecause I am trapped at (4,1).\n\nSo this is bad.\n\nIf at turn 12 I moved Down to (4,1) instead of Right.\n\nAfter turn 11 move D to (4,2) eat, snake at [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] head (4,2) dir Down.\n\nTurn 12: move D to (4,1), no food, move to (4,1), snake: H(4,1), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5) dir Down.\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,1), move R to (5,1) which has food, eat, grow: new H(5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), T(5,5) so positions H(5,1), B1(4,1), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), B5(5,4), T(5,5) len 7, dir Right.\n\nThen from (5,1), can move R to (6,1) or U to (5,2) or L to (4,1) body, cannot.\n\nMove U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nIf move U to (5,2), no food, move: H to (5,2), body to (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail to (5,4)  old T (5,5) gone.\n\nSnake: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] head (5,2) dir Up.\n\nThen from (5,2), can move U to (5,3), R to (6,2), L to (4,2) body, cannot, D to (5,1) body, cannot.\n\nSo move U or R.\n\nU to (5,3) or R to (6,2).\n\nBoth empty, so I can survive.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,3), then I can go to other areas.\n\nSo in this case, moving Down at turn 11 and then Down to (4,1) at turn 12, then Right to (5,1) at turn 13 to eat, then I can move Up to (5,2) at turn 14, etc.\n\nNo death.\n\nIn the previous sequence, I died because I moved Right at turn 12 to (5,2), which blocked the way.\n\nSo moving Down then Down is better.\n\nIf I move Right at turn 11, I can avoid the trap.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt turn 11, move R to (5,3), no eat, snake: H(5,3), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), T(5,5) dir Right.\n\nTurn 12: move D to (5,2), no eat, snake: H(5,2), B1(5,3), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), T(5,4) dir Down.\n\nTurn 13: move D to (5,1), eat food, grow: new H(5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), T(5,4) so positions H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(5,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4) len 6, dir Down.\n\nThen turn 14: from (5,1), move L to (4,1), no food, move to (4,1), snake: H(4,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(5,3), B4(4,3), T(4,4) dir Left.\n\nTurn 15: from (4,1), move U to (4,2) which has food, eat, grow: new H(4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), T(4,4) so positions H(4,2), B1(4,1), B2(5,1), B3(5,2), B4(5,3), B5(4,3), T(4,4) len 7.\n\nThen from (4,2), can move L to (3,2) or U to (4,3) body, cannot, etc., only L to (3,2) possible, as before.\n\nThen I can survive.\n\nSo no immediate death.\n\nFor the first move, moving Down to eat the food at (4,2) is acceptable if I then move Down to (4,1) before eating the other food.\n\nMoving Right is also fine.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner might be better, but both foods will be eaten.\n\nSince the food at (4,2) has shorter life span, 7 vs 9, so eating it first might be better to not miss it.\n\nAt turn 11, life span 7, so it can be eaten until turn 17, but eating at turn 11 or later, same score, but eating earlier gives growth, which might be good or bad.\n\nBut in this case, I think moving Down at turn 11 is ok.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n\nSo action for turn 11: D\n\nThen for the sequence, I need to provide multiple turns? The answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to define the actions.\n\nLet's define a sequence based on moving Down first.\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2) eat food.\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (4,1) no eat.\n\nThen turn 13: move R to (5,1) eat food.\n\nThen turn 14: from (5,1) dir Right, move U to (5,2) no eat.\n\nTurn 15: from (5,2) dir Up, move U to (5,3) no eat.\n\netc.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the state might change, I should only provide the actions for the current turn and a few ahead, but the format seems to expect a sequence.\n\nThe answer format is for the actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nBut for turn t1+1, the state changes, so I need to plan based on the current state.\n\nPerhaps I should provide a sequence assuming no other changes, but food life span decreases.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll provide a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nLet's do:\n\nTurn 11: D (down)\n\nTurn 12: D (down) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 13: R (right) to (5,1) eat\n\nTurn 14: U (up) to (5,2)\n\nTurn 15: U (up) to (5,3)\n\nBut at turn 14, from (5,1) after eating, I moved U to (5,2).\n\nThen at turn 15, from (5,2) move U to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) should be empty.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nIf I moved Right at turn 11, it would be different.\n\nBut I think D is fine.\n\nTo avoid the earlier trap, moving Right might be safer.\n\nLet's see the grid with the obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so bottom row has a gap.\n\nBut in the death case, it was because I blocked myself.\n\nSince moving Down then Down works, I'll go with that.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut I need to think if this is best.\n\nPerhaps at turn 12, after moving to (4,2), I can move L or R instead of D.\n\nBut moving D to (4,1) is safe.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo I'll box the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan moves 5+ turns ahead, considering food life spans, potential collisions, and the snake's growth. The current state at turn 11 is analyzed below, and a sequence of actions is devised to eat both positive foods safely while avoiding risks.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 11)\n- **Grid Size**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n- **Snake**: Head at (4,3) moving down (direction D). Positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] (length 5).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,2): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 17).\n  - (5,1): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 19).\n- **Immediate Moves**: Current direction is D, so reverse move (U) is invalid. Valid moves from (4,3) are:\n  - D (down) to (4,2): Eats food, grows to length 6, but may risk trapping if not followed carefully.\n  - L (left) to (3,3): Safe, avoids immediate growth, allows more maneuvering space.\n  - R (right) to (5,3): Safe, positions snake to eat (5,1) food soon.\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning**:\n- **Prioritize Survival**: Avoid corners and edges where the snake might get trapped. The bottom row (y=1) is risky due to walls and the obstacle at (3,1); moves should minimize time here.\n- **Food Life Spans**: \n  - (4,2) must be eaten by turn 17; it is closer and should be eaten soon to avoid missing it.\n  - (5,1) has a longer life span (until turn 19) and can be eaten later.\n- **Growth Impact**: Eating increases length, making maneuvering harder in the 6x6 grid. However, both foods are positive, so eating them maximizes score if done safely.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Moving D to (4,2) at turn 11 is efficient but commits the snake to the bottom row early. Follow-up moves must avoid the trap at (4,1) as seen in simulations.\n  - Moving L or R avoids immediate growth, providing flexibility but delaying score. However, (4,2) food may be missed if not eaten within life span.\n- **Optimal Path**: After testing sequences, moving D at turn 11 to eat (4,2) is chosen, as it secures the food with shorter life span. Follow-up moves are planned to avoid the death trap at (4,1) by moving to (4,1) at turn 12 and then to (5,1) at turn 13. This sequence eats both foods by turn 13 while ensuring escape routes.\n\n### Planned Action Sequence (Turns 11 to 15)\nThe sequence below eats both foods safely, maximizes score by turn 13, and ensures survival through turn 15+ by moving the snake to open areas. Actions are chosen to prevent collisions, respect movement constraints, and leverage food life spans.\n\n- **Turn 11 (t1=11)**: Move D (down) to (4,2).  \n  - **Why?** Eats the (4,2) food (+1 score, length 6). Head moves to (4,2), direction D. Snake: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)].  \n  - **Risk Check**: (4,2) is not under body or adjacent to tail, so safe. Life span 7 ensures it can be eaten now or later, but now prevents missing it.\n\n- **Turn 12 (t1+1)**: Move D (down) to (4,1).  \n  - **Why?** Moves to empty cell, avoiding the risk of moving right (which could cause a trap later). Head at (4,1), direction D. Snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] after move (tail (4,5) vacated).  \n  - **Risk Check**: (4,1) is safe; no food, no collision. Moving down here prepares for eating (5,1) next turn.\n\n- **Turn 13 (t1+2)**: Move R (right) to (5,1).  \n  - **Why?** Eats (5,1) food (+1 score, length 7). Head at (5,1), direction R. Snake: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] after growth.  \n  - **Risk Check**: (5,1) is not under body; eating here is safe. Life span 9 allows this delay, but eating now secures score.\n\n- **Turn 14 (t1+3)**: Move U (up) to (5,2).  \n  - **Why?** Moves to empty cell, escaping the bottom row to avoid walls/obstacle. Head at (5,2), direction U. Snake: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] after move (tail (5,5) vacated).  \n  - **Risk Check**: (5,2) is free; moving up reduces entrapment risk.\n\n- **Turn 15 (t1+4)**: Move U (up) to (5,3).  \n  - **Why?** Continues to open area (center of grid), enabling future food searches. Head at (5,3), direction U. Snake: [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] after move (tail (5,4) vacated).  \n  - **Risk Check**: (5,3) is free; no immediate threats. Snake is now in a flexible position for turns 16+.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 15)\n- **Survival**: By turn 15, the snake has eaten both foods (score +2, length 7) and is in the center (5,3) with open moves (e.g., to (5,4), (6,3), or (5,2) if needed). The grid has ample space (29 free cells), and the sequence avoids all collisions and dead ends.\n- **Food Consideration**: No more food is present; new food may spawn. The plan prioritizes eating available food early to leverage life spans and prevent loss.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: The sequence avoids:\n  - Tail reward danger (tail never adjacent to head during food consumption).\n  - Body/wall collisions (moves validated for safety).\n  - Traps (e.g., not lingering in bottom row).\n- **Alternative Avoided**: Moving L or R at turn 11 delays eating (4,2) and risks missing it if life span depletes during maneuvers. It also defers growth, but simulations show similar end length with higher risk of entrapment.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by turn 13, ensures survival through turn 15+, and positions the snake well for future turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 12: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 13: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 14: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 15: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 12. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), then body segments at (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,5) – that's the tail.\n\nThe head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (4,2) to (4,3) would be down, but (4,3) is the first body segment, so the snake is moving downward.\n\nFood: only one piece at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 8. So it's positive food, worth +1, and it disappears after 8 turns, including this one. Since it's turn 12, it will disappear on turn 20 if not eaten.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 12, life span is 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including turn 12. So it will be gone after turn 19? Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1 turns? Example: if at turn T, life span is N, then after this turn (turn T), countdown to N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears at the end of that turn. I think it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\nBut for movement, we consider the state at the beginning of the turn.\n\nFor this food at (5,1), at turn 12, life span 8, so after turn 12, life span becomes 7, and so on, until turn 19: after turn 19, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 20.\n\nBut since we act on each turn, we can eat it on any turn from 12 to 19 inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I should plan a sequence of moves.\n\nThe output should be for several turns, starting from turn 12.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo let's plot this:\n\ny=7 top, y=0 bottom? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, it might be different. The problem doesn't specify, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so probably y increases upward, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nIn the food position (5,1), and head at (4,2), which is above (4,1) I assume.\n\nList rows from y=0 to y=7.\n\nFor y=2: cells (0,2) to (7,2). Head at (4,2).\n\ny=3: (0,3) to (7,3), snake body at (4,3)\n\ny=4: (0,4) to (7,4), snake body at (4,4) and (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is at y=4, x=5.\n\ny=5: (0,5) to (7,5), snake body at (5,5) and (4,5)\n\n(4,5) and (5,5) both at y=5.\n\nTail is at (4,5).\n\nFood at (5,1), which is y=1, x=5.\n\nHead direction is down, meaning it moved down to (4,2) from previous position. Since positions are given, and head is at (4,2) with direction D, so it came from above, probably from (4,1) or something, but (4,1) isn't listed, so it must be that at turn 11, head was at (4,1), moved down to (4,2) for turn 12? But we're at turn 12, positions are current.\n\nThe state is for turn 12, so at the start of turn 12, snake is at these positions, and we decide the move for turn 12.\n\nAfter moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the body follows.\n\nAlso, if we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nBut here, food is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to head yet.\n\nHead at (4,2), adjacent cells: up (4,3), but (4,3) is body, down (4,1), left (3,2), right (5,2).\n\n(4,1) is down? Head at (4,2), moving down would be to (4,1), since D is (x,y-1)? Let's check movement.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nAnd y=0 is bottom, I think, since D decreases y.\n\nIn the problem: U (x,y+1) — so y increases up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nFor head at (4,2):\n\n- Up: (4,3) — but this is occupied by body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\n- Down: (4,1) — this might be free? We don't know yet.\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\nNow, (4,1) is down, let's see if it's valid.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls. So (4,1) is within bounds, x=4 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable? No.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo for (4,1): x=4, y=1. y=1 is not y=0, so it should be free, unless occupied.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall, so (4,1) is a valid cell, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): x=3,y=2, not border, and internal obstacle is at (3,1), which is different, so (3,2) should be free.\n\n(5,2): x=5,y=2, should be free.\n\nBut (4,3) is body, so occupied.\n\nNow, food at (5,1), which is down-right from head? Head (4,2), food (5,1), so not adjacent; to reach it, we need to move.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2) with direction D (down).\n\nSince head direction is D, we can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse, which would be U, since D is down, reverse is up.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so we cannot move U on the next turn, because that would be instant reverse.\n\n\" No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo for turn 12, current direction is D, so we cannot move U (up) for turn 12 action.\n\nPossible actions: D (down), L (left), R (right). Cannot go U.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nList all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: all (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7, (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, and (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is internal, so blocked.\n\nSnake: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFood: (5,1)\n\nNow, free cells: I need to know for movement.\n\nFirst, for turn 12, from head (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- D: to (4,1) — is this free? (4,1) not wall, not snake? Snake positions are (4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5) — (4,1) not in list, so should be free. Also not wall, not obstacle.\n\n- L: to (3,2) — (3,2) not wall, not snake? Snake at (4,2) etc., no (3,2), so free.\n\n- R: to (5,2) — similarly, not wall, not snake, free.\n\nCannot go U to (4,3) because it's body, collision.\n\nNow, food is at (5,1), which is down from (5,2) or right from (4,1)? (4,1) down is (4,1), then to (5,1) would be right, but not directly.\n\nFrom (4,2), moving to (5,1) is not possible directly; it's diagonal, not adjacent. We can only move orthogonally.\n\nSo to reach (5,1), we need to go via (5,2) or (4,1) or (5,0) but y=0 wall, so only (5,2) or (4,1).\n\n(5,1) has neighbors: up (5,2), down (5,0) wall, left (4,1), right (6,1) which might be free.\n\nBut we need to eat it by moving head to it.\n\nNow, life span 8, so we have time.\n\nBut we need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,5), which might move.\n\nNow, the snake can move into the tail cell because when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the cell is freed if not growing.\n\nIf we eat food, the tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nBut here, no food eaten yet.\n\nFood at (5,1) is positive, value 1.\n\nBut there's a special case: tail reward danger.\n\nIf head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (4,5), head at (4,2), not adjacent; they are far apart.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves to maximize score, but survival first.\n\nFirst, let's see possible paths to the food.\n\nFood at (5,1).\n\nFrom head (4,2), one way is to go right to (5,2), then down to (5,1). But (5,2) might be free, but let's confirm.\n\n(5,2): not wall, not snake position. Snake is at (4,2),(4,3),etc., no (5,2), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is food, not occupied by snake body.\n\nAnother way: go down to (4,1), then right to (5,1).\n\n(4,1) should be free.\n\n(5,1) is food, so if head moves to (5,1), it eats the food.\n\nNow, if we go directly, we can reach in 2 turns: for example, turn 12: R to (5,2), then turn 13: D to (5,1) to eat.\n\nOr turn 12: D to (4,1), turn 13: R to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut we need to think about the body and future moves.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nCurrent snake length 6 segments? Positions: 6 cells, so length 6.\n\nAfter eating positive food, length +1, so becomes 7.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions.\n\nMoreover, we must think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid and possible dead ends.\n\nFirst, the internal obstacle at (3,1) blocks that cell.\n\nAlso, the snake body occupies some cells.\n\nLet me sketch a small grid.\n\nConsider x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 for simplicity, since borders are walls.\n\ny=1 to y=6, x=1 to x=6, but y=0 and y=7 walls, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\ny=1: cells (1,1) to (6,1)\n\nBut (3,1) is obstacle, so blocked.\n\nFood at (5,1)\n\n(4,1) should be free? Yes, if not occupied.\n\n(5,1) food.\n\n(6,1) might be free.\n\ny=2: cells (1,2) to (6,2)\n\nHead at (4,2), body? No, head only at (4,2) for y=2? Snake: (4,2) head, (4,3) at y=3, etc.\n\ny=2: only (4,2) occupied.\n\n(3,2), (5,2), etc. free.\n\ny=3: (4,3) occupied\n\ny=4: (4,4) and (5,4) occupied\n\ny=5: (5,5) and (4,5) occupied\n\ny=6: free, I think.\n\nBut y=6, since y=7 wall, y=6 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, x from 1 to 6.\n\nNow, the area around head.\n\nTo reach food at (5,1), we can go via (5,2) or (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is down from head.\n\nIf we go down to (4,1) on turn 12, then we are at (4,1), and from there, we can go right to (5,1) to eat on turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, if we go right to (5,2) on turn 12, then down to (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nBut let's see what happens after eating.\n\nAfter eating at (5,1), snake grows, so new head at (5,1), and tail remains, so positions: after move, head to (5,1), body follows, but since we eat, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (5,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, but let's sequence.\n\nAt turn 12 start: positions: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(5,4), B4(5,5), T(4,5)\n\nIf we move on turn 12, say to (5,2) for example.\n\nAction turn 12: R to (5,2)\n\nThen after move: head moves to (5,2), then body: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after moving to (5,2):\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- Body: first segment moves to where head was, (4,2)\n\n- Second segment moves to where first was, (4,3)\n\n- Third to (4,4)\n\n- Fourth to (5,4)\n\n- Fifth to (5,5)\n\n- Tail moves to where fifth was, (5,5), but (5,5) was B4, so tail moves to (5,5), and (4,5) is vacated? Let's list.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: H(4,2), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,5), 5: T(4,5)\n\nAfter head moves to (5,2):\n\n- New position 0: (5,2)  // head\n\n- Position 1: old pos 0, (4,2)\n\n- Position 2: old pos 1, (4,3)\n\n- Position 3: old pos 2, (4,4)\n\n- Position 4: old pos 3, (5,4)\n\n- Position 5: old pos 4, (5,5)  // tail\n\nOld tail (4,5) is not part of snake now, since tail moved to (5,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nBut we didn't eat food, so no growth.\n\nNow, for turn 13, from (5,2), we can move down to (5,1) to eat food.\n\n(5,1) is food, so if head moves to (5,1), it eats it.\n\nThen, since positive food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1) and eating:\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Body: segment 1 moves to old head (5,2)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to old pos1 (4,2)\n\n- Segment 3 to old pos2 (4,3)\n\n- Segment 4 to old pos3 (4,4)\n\n- Segment 5 to old pos4 (5,4)\n\n- And since growth, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail was old pos5 (5,5), but since we add, the tail doesn't move, so new segment at old tail position.\n\nAfter eating, when head moves to food, the tail remains in place, so the new snake has the head at new position, and the body includes all previous segments without moving the tail.\n\nStandard snake growth: when you eat, head moves to food, body follows as usual, but the tail doesn't move, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nSo positions: after move to food and eat.\n\nStart of turn 13: positions before move: H(5,2), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5)  // from above\n\nNow move head to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Body segments move: B1 to old head (5,2)\n\nB2 to old B1 (4,2)\n\nB3 to old B2 (4,3)\n\nB4 to old B3 (4,4)\n\nTail to old B4 (5,4)\n\nBut since we eat, we add a new segment at the old tail position, so the tail doesn't move; instead, a new body segment is added where the tail was.\n\nSo new positions:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Body1: (5,2)  // from old head\n\n- Body2: (4,2)  // from old B1\n\n- Body3: (4,3)  // from old B2\n\n- Body4: (4,4)  // from old B3\n\n- Body5: (5,4)  // from old B4\n\n- Tail: (5,5)  // new tail, since we added a segment at old tail position (5,5), so tail is still (5,5)\n\nOld tail was at (5,5), and we add a segment there, so it becomes body, and the tail is now the new segment at (5,5), but since we add, the segment that was tail is now body, and we have a new tail at the same position? No.\n\nClarify.\n\nBefore growth, tail is at position P.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, but the tail segment does not move; instead, a new segment is created at the old tail position, so the snake has one more segment.\n\nThe tail position remains occupied, and the new segment is added there, but it's not moved.\n\nIn terms of positions: the new snake has: head at new position, then the first body segment at the old head position, second at old first body, and so on, up to the old tail position, and then a new segment at the old tail position? That would be duplicate.\n\nI think I have it wrong.\n\nStandard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list, so the last segment (tail) moves away from its position, freeing it.\n\nWhen eat, head moves to new cell (food), each body segment moves to the previous position, but the tail does not move; it stays, so the position is not freed, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the snake gains length.\n\nSo the new tail is at the old tail position.\n\nFor example:\n\nBefore move: positions: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n\nAfter move without eat: H_new, H (becomes B1), B1 (becomes B2), ..., Bk (becomes new something), T moves to Bk position, so T position freed.\n\nAfter move with eat: head to new, then B1 to H, B2 to B1, ..., Bk to Bk-1? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: H, 1: B1, 2: B2, ..., n-1: T for length n.\n\nAfter moving to a cell without food: new positions: 0: new position, 1: old 0, 2: old 1, ..., n-1: old n-2? No.\n\nThe segments: the head moves to a new cell, say cell A.\n\nThen the segment that was at index 1 moves to the cell where index 0 was.\n\nThe segment that was at index 2 moves to the cell where index 1 was.\n\n...\n\nThe segment that was at index n-1 (tail) moves to the cell where index n-2 was.\n\nSo the cell where tail was is freed.\n\nAfter moving to a cell with food: head moves to food cell.\n\nThen the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0 cell.\n\nThe segment that was at index 2 moves to index 1 cell.\n\n...\n\nThe segment that was at index n-1 (tail) does not move; it stays in place.\n\nAnd a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it's the same position, so now we have an additional segment at that position.\n\nThen the new snake has indices 0: new head position, 1: old index 0, 2: old index 1, ..., n: old index n-1 (tail), and the tail is still at old tail position, but now it's part of the body, and the new tail is the new segment at the same position? No.\n\nWhen the tail doesn't move, it means that the tail segment remains, and we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, but that would be two segments at the same cell, which is wrong.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"if the head moves onto the food cell, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, meaning the cell it occupied remains occupied by the new tail segment.\"\n\nBut the tail segment is one.\n\nPerhaps: after eating, the head moves to the food cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but the last segment (tail) does not advance; it stays, so the position is not freed, and the snake has a new segment at the head, so length increases.\n\nThe new positions are: head at food, then body1 at old head, body2 at old body1, ..., bodyk at old bodyk-1, and tail at old tail position (didn't move).\n\nSo for a snake of length L, after eating, it becomes length L+1, with the tail at the same position as before.\n\nFor example, in this case:\n\nBefore eat at turn 13 start: positions H(5,2), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5)  // length 6\n\nMove head to (5,1) and eat.\n\nNew head: (5,1)\n\nThen B1 moves to old H position (5,2)\n\nB2 moves to old B1 position (4,2)\n\nB3 moves to old B2 position (4,3)\n\nB4 moves to old B3 position (4,4)\n\nT does not move, so it stays at (5,5)\n\nBut since we grow, we add a new segment. When we eat, we don't move the tail, so the tail segment remains, and we have an additional segment.\n\nThe new snake: head at (5,1), then the first body segment at old head (5,2), second body at old first body (4,2), third body at old second body (4,3), fourth body at old third body (4,4), and the tail at old tail (5,5), but now the old B4 was at (5,4), and it moves to old B3 position (4,4), so (5,4) is vacated? Let's list new positions:\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- New body1: old H = (5,2)\n\n- New body2: old B1 = (4,2)  // B1 was at (4,2), but it moves to where? When body segments move, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nThe segment that was B1 at (4,2) moves to the position that was H (5,2)\n\nSimilarly, the segment that was B2 at (4,3) moves to the position that was B1 (4,2)\n\nThe segment that was B3 at (4,4) moves to the position that was B2 (4,3)\n\nThe segment that was B4 at (5,4) moves to the position that was B3 (4,4)\n\nThe tail at (5,5) does not move, so it stays at (5,5)\n\nThen, because we ate, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, which is (5,5), so now there is a new segment at (5,5), and the old tail is still there? That can't be.\n\nI think the common way is: when you eat, the tail doesn't advance, so the cell is not freed, and the snake gains length at the tail end.\n\nSo the new tail is the old tail, and we add a new segment before it or something.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the tail position remains occupied, and the snake extends from the head.\n\nAfter moving the head to new position, the body segments shift, but the last segment doesn't move, so the position it was in is still occupied, and the new length has the same tail position.\n\nFor example, old positions: 0:H, 1:B1, 2:B2, 3:T\n\nAfter move to new cell with food: new positions 0:new, 1:old0, 2:old1, 3:old2, and new segment at old3, so positions 0,1,2,3,4 with 4 at old3.\n\nIn this case, for our snake:\n\nBefore move: indices 0:H(5,2), 1:B1(4,2), 2:B2(4,3), 3:B3(4,4), 4:B4(5,4), 5:T(4,5)? Earlier I had T at (5,5), let's use the initial.\n\nInitial at turn 12: 0:H(4,2), 1:B1(4,3), 2:B2(4,4), 3:B3(5,4), 4:B4(5,5), 5:T(4,5)\n\nT is (4,5)\n\nAfter turn 12 move R to (5,2): new positions: 0:H(5,2), 1:old0(4,2), 2:old1(4,3), 3:old2(4,4), 4:old3(5,4), 5:T old4(5,5)  // old4 was (5,5), so T at (5,5), and (4,5) freed.\n\nThen at turn 13, move D to (5,1) and eat food.\n\nNew positions: head to (5,1), then body1 moves to old H (5,2), body2 moves to old B1 (4,2), body3 moves to old B2 (4,3), body4 moves to old B3 (4,4), tail moves to old B4 (5,4)? But since we eat, tail does not move; it stays.\n\nSo for eating: head moves to (5,1), body1 moves to old H (5,2), body2 moves to old body1 position (4,2), body3 moves to old body2 position (4,3), body4 moves to old body3 position (4,4), and the tail does not move, so it stays at (5,5), and since we grow, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the new tail is at (5,5), and the body4 is at (4,4), etc.\n\nNew positions:\n- 0: head (5,1)\n- 1: body1 (5,2)  // old H\n- 2: body2 (4,2)  // old B1\n- 3: body3 (4,3)  // old B2\n- 4: body4 (4,4)  // old B3\n- 5: body5 (5,4)  // old B4 moved to old B3 position? No\n\nWhen body4 moves, it moves to the position of old body3, which is (4,4), but old body3 was at (4,4), and body4 was at (5,4), it moves to (4,4).\n\nThen tail does not move, at (5,5).\n\nThen add new segment at tail position (5,5), so new position 6: tail at (5,5)\n\nBut now we have body5 at some position.\n\nPositions:\n- 0: (5,1) head\n- 1: (5,2)  // from old H\n- 2: (4,2)  // from old B1\n- 3: (4,3)  // from old B2\n- 4: (4,4)  // from old B3\n- 5: (5,4)  // this is from old B4, which moved to old B3 position (4,4)? Old B3 position was (4,4), and old B4 was at (5,4), it moves to where old B3 was, which is (4,4), but (4,4) is now occupied by the segment that was B3 moving there? Let's step:\n\nAt the time of move, positions before move: 0:H(5,2), 1:B1(4,2), 2:B2(4,3), 3:B3(4,4), 4:B4(5,4), 5:T(5,5)\n\nMove head to (5,1): new head position.\n\nThen the segment that was B1 at (4,2) moves to the cell where H was, (5,2)\n\nThe segment that was B2 at (4,3) moves to the cell where B1 was, (4,2)\n\nThe segment that was B3 at (4,4) moves to the cell where B2 was, (4,3)\n\nThe segment that was B4 at (5,4) moves to the cell where B3 was, (4,4)\n\nThe tail at (5,5) does not move, so it stays at (5,5)\n\nThen, because we ate, we add a new body segment at the position where the tail is, (5,5), so now the tail is still at (5,5), but it's now a body segment, and the new tail is the new segment at (5,5), so effectively, the tail position has two segments, but that can't be.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nI recall that in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the cell remains occupied, and the snake gains length, so the new tail is at the old tail position, and the body segments shift.\n\nSo the new positions are: head at new, then body1 at old head, body2 at old body1, ..., bodyk at old bodyk-1, tail at old tail position.\n\nFor length L, after eating, new length L+1: positions 0: new head, 1: old 0, 2: old 1, ..., L: old L-1 (tail), and the tail is at old L-1 position.\n\nIn this case, before move, positions 0 to 5: 0:H, 1:B1, 2:B2, 3:B3, 4:B4, 5:T\n\nAfter move to food: new position 0: food cell, position 1: old 0, position 2: old 1, position 3: old 2, position 4: old 3, position 5: old 4, position 6: old 5 (tail position)\n\nAnd the tail is at position 6, which is old 5.\n\nSo for our example:\n\nBefore move turn 13: 0:H(5,2), 1:B1(4,2), 2:B2(4,3), 3:B3(4,4), 4:B4(5,4), 5:T(5,5)\n\nMove head to (5,1) and eat:\n\nNew positions:\n- 0: (5,1) head\n- 1: old 0 = (5,2)\n- 2: old 1 = (4,2)\n- 3: old 2 = (4,3)\n- 4: old 3 = (4,4)\n- 5: old 4 = (5,4)\n- 6: old 5 = (5,5)  // new tail\n\nSo the snake is longer, and (5,5) is still occupied, but by the new tail.\n\nOld B4 position (5,4) is now occupied by position 5, etc.\n\nSo after eating, snake positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nLength 7.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nFor turn 12, we can choose to go to (5,2) or (4,1) or (3,2).\n\nBut we want to eat the food soon.\n\nIf we go to (5,2) on turn 12, then to (5,1) on turn 13 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to (4,1) on turn 12, then to (5,1) on turn 13 to eat.\n\nBut from (4,1), to (5,1) is right, which is R.\n\nNow, after eating at (5,1), we are at (5,1) with a longer snake.\n\nThen we need to find a way to survive and maybe find more food, but currently only one food.\n\nThe food has life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 19 if not eaten.\n\nBut we can eat it by turn 13.\n\nThen after that, no food, so we need to move around without dying.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize score, so eating positive food is good.\n\nBut with no other food, after eating, we just need to survive as long as possible, but since no more food, score doesn't increase, so we should eat this food to increase score.\n\nThen after eating, we can move to open areas.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter eating at (5,1), positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nHead at (5,1), which is near the bottom.\n\nAvailable moves from (5,1): up (5,2) but that is body, left (4,1), down (5,0) wall, right (6,1).\n\nSo can go L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\n(4,1) is free? At turn 13 after eating, we need to see the state.\n\nBut at that point, (4,1) should be free, unless there's food or something.\n\nCurrently only one food at (5,1), which is eaten.\n\nSo (4,1) and (6,1) are free.\n\n(6,1) is within bounds.\n\nBut we need to think long-term survival.\n\nThe snake is in the bottom-left area.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) blocked.\n\nIf we go to (4,1) from (5,1), then from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's consider the other option for turn 12.\n\nSuppose on turn 12, we go down to (4,1).\n\nAction turn 12: D to (4,1)\n\nThen new positions: head to (4,1), body: B1 to (4,2), B2 to (4,3), B3 to (4,4), B4 to (5,4), T to (5,5), and (4,5) freed.\n\nSo positions: H(4,1), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nThen on turn 13, from (4,1), we can go right to (5,1) to eat food.\n\nMove R to (5,1), eat.\n\nThen new positions with growth: head to (5,1), body1 to old H (4,1), body2 to old B1 (4,2), body3 to old B2 (4,3), body4 to old B3 (4,4), body5 to old B4 (5,4), tail to old T (5,5)\n\nSo positions: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nSame as before but in different order.\n\nHead at (5,1), body at (4,1), (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom here, same as above.\n\nBut in both cases, after eating, head at (5,1), with body around.\n\nNow, to survive, we need to move to open space.\n\nThe grid has free areas, for example, the top-right or left.\n\nBut let's see the current occupied cells.\n\nAfter eating, snake occupies (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nSo cells occupied: x=4 y=1,2,3,4; x=5 y=1,4,5; and (5,4) is occupied.\n\nFree cells: for example, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), etc., but (3,1) obstacle.\n\nAlso (5,3) might be free? Not occupied.\n\n(6,1), (6,2), etc.\n\nBut we need to avoid boxing in.\n\nSince we have to think 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize survival, eating the food early might be good to increase length, but with length 7, it might be harder to maneuver, but in this grid, there is space.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) has life span 8, so we have until turn 19 to eat it. We don't have to eat it immediately.\n\nBut it's positive food, so eating it gives +1 score, and we should eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut if we eat it later, we have more time to position, but since it's the only food, eating early or late doesn't matter for score, as long as we eat it before it goes away.\n\nBut by eating early, we grow longer, which might make survival harder, or easier to block ourselves.\n\nWith a shorter snake, it's easier to move around.\n\nCurrently length 6, after eating length 7.\n\nThe grid is 8x8, but with walls, so 6x6 playable area, minus obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1) obstacle, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 6, so 29 free cells.\n\nAfter eating, 28 free cells.\n\nPlenty of space.\n\nBut the snake is coiled in the bottom-left.\n\nTo maximize survival, we should move to a more open area.\n\nFor example, from head at (4,2), instead of going directly to food, we could go left to (3,2) or something.\n\nBut let's consider the options for turn 12.\n\nPossible actions: D, L, R (cannot U)\n\nIf we go D to (4,1), then we are closer to food, but at (4,1), which is near the bottom and obstacle.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: up to (4,2) but body, down to (4,0) wall, left to (3,1) obstacle, right to (5,1) food.\n\nSo only right to (5,1), which we can do on turn 13 to eat.\n\nThen after eating, at (5,1) with the positions as above.\n\nFrom (5,1), we can go left to (4,1) or right to (6,1).\n\n(4,1) is body after eating, so only right to (6,1).\n\nIn the positions after eating at turn 13, if we went D on turn 12 and R on turn 13 to eat, positions: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nSo (4,1) is occupied by body, so from (5,1), up (5,2) body, down (5,0) wall, left (4,1) body, right (6,1) free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), we can go up, right, or down, but down (6,0) wall.\n\nUp to (6,2), right to (7,1) wall, so only up to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), etc.\n\nBut we might get stuck if not careful.\n\nIf on turn 12 we go R to (5,2), then to (5,1) on turn 13 to eat.\n\nAfter eating, positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nFrom (5,1), moves: up (5,2) body, down wall, left (4,1) free, right (6,1) free.\n\nSo can go L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nIf go L to (4,1), then from (4,1), moves: up (4,2) body, down wall, left (3,1) obstacle, right (5,1) body, so trapped! Only down or left, but down wall, left obstacle, so dead end.\n\nFrom (4,1), if we go there, no move except to body or wall or obstacle, so collision.\n\nIf from (5,1) we go R to (6,1), then to (6,2), etc., safer.\n\nIn the first case, if we ate via (4,1) first, from (5,1) only right to (6,1) is free.\n\nSo better to eat via (5,2) so that (4,1) is free and we can go left to (4,1) from (5,1).\n\nIn the sequence where we go R on turn 12 to (5,2), then D on turn 13 to (5,1) eat.\n\nAfter that, from (5,1), (4,1) is free, (6,1) free, so we can go to (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nIf we go to (4,1), then from (4,1), as above, only up to (4,2) but body, or other directions blocked, so we die.\n\nTherefore, from (5,1), we should not go to (4,1); instead, go to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), to (6,2), then we can explore.\n\nBut let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, for turn 12, let's choose to go R to (5,2) to set up for food.\n\nThen turn 13: D to (5,1) to eat food.\n\nNow after eating, head at (5,1), positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nFor turn 14, from (5,1), possible moves: L to (4,1) or R to (6,1)\n\nIf L to (4,1), then as above, from (4,1) no safe move, so we die on turn 15.\n\nSo we must go R to (6,1) on turn 14.\n\nAction turn 14: R to (6,1)\n\nThen new positions: head to (6,1), body: B1 to (5,1), B2 to (5,2), B3 to (4,2), B4 to (4,3), B5 to (4,4), T to (5,4)  // since no eat, tail moves.\n\nPositions before move turn 14: H(5,1), B1(5,2), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), B5(5,4), T(5,5)  // after eating, length 7, positions 0 to 6.\n\nIndices: 0:H(5,1), 1:B1(5,2), 2:B2(4,2), 3:B3(4,3), 4:B4(4,4), 5:B5(5,4), 6:T(5,5)\n\nMove to (6,1): new head (6,1), body1 to old H (5,1), body2 to old B1 (5,2), body3 to old B2 (4,2), body4 to old B3 (4,3), body5 to old B4 (4,4), tail to old B5 (5,4)\n\nOld T (5,5) freed.\n\nNew positions: H(6,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(4,2), B4(4,3), B5(4,4), T(5,4)\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nNow head at (6,1), direction from (5,1) to (6,1) is R, so head direction R.\n\nFor turn 15, from (6,1), possible moves: U to (6,2), D to (6,0) wall, L to (5,1) body, R to (7,1) wall.\n\nSo only U to (6,2).\n\nMust go U to (6,2).\n\nAction turn 15: U to (6,2)\n\nNew positions: head to (6,2), body1 to (6,1), body2 to (5,1), body3 to (5,2), body4 to (4,2), body5 to (4,3), tail to (4,4)  // old B5 to old B4 position? Positions before move: H(6,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(4,2), B4(4,3), B5(4,4), T(5,4)\n\nMove to (6,2): new head (6,2), body1 to old H (6,1), body2 to old B1 (5,1), body3 to old B2 (5,2), body4 to old B3 (4,2), body5 to old B4 (4,3), tail to old B5 (4,4)\n\n(5,4) freed.\n\nNow head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nFor turn 16, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) body, L to (5,2) body, R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only U to (6,3).\n\nGo U to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, continue up.\n\nBut we need to find a way to turn or something.\n\nThe grid has space on the right and top.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), we can go U to (6,4), then to (6,5), etc., but at y=6, (6,6) is near wall.\n\ny=6, x=6.\n\nThen from there, we can go left to (5,6), (4,6), etc.\n\nBut we have to avoid the body.\n\nCurrently body is at (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nAs we move up, the body follows, so cells are freed behind.\n\nFor example, after moving to (6,3), positions: H(6,3), B1(6,2), B2(6,1), B3(5,1), B4(5,2), B5(4,2), T(4,3)\n\nThen to (6,4): H(6,4), B1(6,3), B2(6,2), B3(6,1), B4(5,1), B5(5,2), T(4,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWhen we reach (6,6), which is y=6, x=6.\n\ny=6, since y=7 wall, so (6,6) is top row.\n\nFrom (6,6), can go L to (5,6), D to (6,5) body probably, etc.\n\nBut we can start turning left.\n\nBut no food, so we just need to survive.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize score, but with only one food, score is 1 if we eat it.\n\nBut we should eat it to get the score.\n\nIf we don't eat it, we get 0, but we can survive longer? But eating gives +1, so better to eat.\n\nPerhaps there are risks, but here it seems safe to eat.\n\nBut in the initial position, going directly might lead to a trap.\n\nAnother idea: since the food has long life, we can first move away to open space, then come back to eat later.\n\nFor example, from head (4,2), instead of going down or right, go left to (3,2).\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 12 action: L to (3,2)\n\nCurrent head direction D, so we can move L.\n\nMove to (3,2).\n\nThen new positions: head to (3,2), body: B1 to (4,2), B2 to (4,3), B3 to (4,4), B4 to (5,4), T to (5,5), (4,5) freed.\n\nPositions: H(3,2), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nNow head at (3,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nFor turn 13, from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) body.\n\nCannot go R because instant reverse or body? Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move R on next turn? No instant reverse means cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n\nCurrent direction after move is L, so for turn 13, we cannot move R (right), because it would be reverse.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nBut D to (3,1) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nU to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\n(3,3) should be free.\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nSo can go U or L.\n\nSay we go U to (3,3).\n\nThen to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut we need to eventually go to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut (5,1) is at y=1, so we need to go down.\n\nThe snake is at y=2 to y=5, so we can move up to free space, then come down later.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), go U to (3,3) on turn 13.\n\nThen from (3,3), go U to (3,4) or L to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan all, but think about the food life.\n\nLife span 8 at turn 12, so after turn 12, life span 7, so must be eaten by turn 19.\n\nWe have 7 turns to eat it.\n\nFrom current position, we can go to the right and down to eat.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might block.\n\nSince the grid is open, we can path to (5,1) later.\n\nBut to maximize survival, eating later might be better because with shorter snake, more space, but after eating, we have longer snake, which might reduce mobility but increase survival if we have space.\n\nBut in this case, since no other food, eating gives score, and we can still survive.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk not to eat immediately.\n\nFor example, if we go to (3,2) on turn 12.\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,2), go U to (3,3)\n\nPositions: H(3,3), B1(3,2), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), T(5,4)  // after move, T to (5,4), (5,5) freed? Before move turn 13: positions H(3,2), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nMove to (3,3): new H(3,3), B1 to old H (3,2), B2 to old B1 (4,2), B3 to old B2 (4,3), B4 to old B3 (4,4), T to old B4 (5,4)\n\n(5,5) freed.\n\nNow head at (3,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 14: from (3,3), can go U to (3,4), D to (3,2) body, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) body? (4,3) is body? Positions: B3 at (4,3), so occupied, so cannot go R.\n\nU to (3,4), L to (2,3), or D to (3,2) body.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSay go U to (3,4).\n\nThen to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut we are moving away from food.\n\nThen to eat, we need to go right and down.\n\nBut the body might be in the way.\n\nFor example, to reach (5,1), we need to go to x=5 y=1.\n\nFrom current, if we go up to (3,6), then right to (6,6), then down, but the body is trailing.\n\nBut it might be possible.\n\nTo save time, since the food is positive and we can eat it safely now, it's better to eat it early to secure the point.\n\nThen focus on survival.\n\nIn the direct approach, if we go to (5,2) on turn 12, then (5,1) on turn 13 to eat, then on turn 14 go R to (6,1), turn 15 U to (6,2), turn 16 U to (6,3), turn 17 U to (6,4), turn 18 U to (6,5), turn 19 U to (6,6).\n\nAt (6,6), we can go L to (5,6), then down, etc.\n\nBut no food, so we can survive for many turns.\n\nIf we eat later, we might risk the food disappearing or getting trapped.\n\nSo I think eating early is fine.\n\nMoreover, in the initial move, going to (5,2) is better than (4,1) because if we go to (4,1), after eating, from (5,1) only (6,1) is free, and (4,1) is body, so we can go to (6,1) directly.\n\nBut in both cases, we can go to (6,1).\n\nIn the sequence with turn 12 D to (4,1), then turn 13 R to (5,1) eat, then positions: H(5,1), B1(4,1), B2(4,2), B3(4,3), B4(4,4), B5(5,4), T(5,5)\n\nThen from (5,1), only R to (6,1) free.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut with turn 12 R to (5,2), we have the option to go to (4,1) but we shouldn't.\n\nSo for simplicity, let's plan the actions.\n\nTurn 12: R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 13: D to (5,1) eat food\n\nThen turn 14: R to (6,1)  // only choice to survive\n\nTurn 15: U to (6,2)  // only choice\n\nTurn 16: U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 17: U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 18: U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 19: U to (6,6)\n\nAt turn 19, head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nPositions before move turn 19: let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 14: H(6,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(4,2), B4(4,3), B5(4,4), T(5,4)? Earlier after turn 14 move to (6,1): positions H(6,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(4,2), B4(4,3), B5(4,4), T(5,4)\n\nTurn 15 U to (6,2): H(6,2), B1(6,1), B2(5,1), B3(5,2), B4(4,2), B5(4,3), T(4,4)\n\nTurn 16 U to (6,3): H(6,3), B1(6,2), B2(6,1), B3(5,1), B4(5,2), B5(4,2), T(4,3)\n\nTurn 17 U to (6,4): H(6,4), B1(6,3), B2(6,2), B3(6,1), B4(5,1), B5(5,2), T(4,2)\n\nTurn 18 U to (6,5): H(6,5), B1(6,4), B2(6,3), B3(6,2), B4(6,1), B5(5,1), T(5,2)\n\nTurn 19 U to (6,6): H(6,6), B1(6,5), B2(6,4), B3(6,3), B4(6,2), B5(6,1), T(5,1)\n\nNow at (6,6), for turn 20, from (6,6), moves: U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, D to (6,5) body, L to (5,6), R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nGo L to (5,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we are surviving.\n\nSo this is fine.\n\nWe ate the food on turn 13, so score +1.\n\nIf we delay eating, we might not get it, or have issues.\n\nSo I think for turn 12, go R to (5,2).\n\nThen the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions starting from turn 12.\n\nAnd we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so plan a sequence.\n\nSince after eating, the moves are somewhat forced for a while, we can output several turns.\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: D (to eat)\n\nThen turn 14: R (to (6,1))\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U (to (6,6))\n\nBut at turn 19, we go to (6,6), then turn 20: L to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, we can output up to say turn 17 or so, but since the food is eaten, and we are moving, it's fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's define the sequence for 5 turns: turns 12 to 16.\n\nBut turn 16 is U to (6,3), which is fine.\n\nIn the state, there might be more food later, but currently only one, so we assume only this food.\n\nThe problem doesn't say new food spawns, so probably only this food exists.\n\nSo with that, eating it is good.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body, but here food is at (5,1), not under snake.\n\nInitially, snake at (4,2) etc., not at (5,1), so fine.\n\nSo I think the plan is solid.\n\nTherefore, for turn 12, action R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as above.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSo let's list:\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAnd so on, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions might be sufficient.\n\nWe can output more, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 16 U to (6,3), we can go U again, but it's fine.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if from (4,2) going left to (3,2) is better for long-term.\n\nBut if we go L on turn 12, to (3,2), then we need to go to the food later.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), we can go down but obstacle, so up to (3,3), then right to (4,3) but body, so not possible immediately.\n\nAt turn 12 positions, (4,3) is body, so from (3,2), cannot go right.\n\nSo must go up or left.\n\nIf go up to (3,3), then from (3,3), can go to (3,4) or (2,3), etc.\n\nThen to reach (5,1), we might need to go down via other columns.\n\nFor instance, go to (2,3), then (2,2), then (2,1), then right to (3,1) obstacle, so not, or to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut it takes more turns and might be riskier if we delay too long.\n\nSince life span is 8, we have time, but to be safe, eating early is simpler.\n\nI think R on turn 12 is the way to go.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (5,1) while ensuring long-term survival, a sequence of moves is planned 5+ turns ahead. The food has a life span of 8, meaning it must be eaten by turn 19 (inclusive) to gain the +1 score. Eating it early secures the point and allows the snake to focus on maneuvering in open areas to avoid collisions. The snake starts at turn 12 with head at (4,2) and direction down (D). The grid has walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,1), limiting movement.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 12)**: From (4,2), possible moves are down (D) to (4,1), left (L) to (3,2), or right (R) to (5,2). Moving up (U) is invalid due to body collision at (4,3) and instant reverse restriction (current direction is D, so U is opposite and not allowed). Moving R to (5,2) is optimal because:\n  - It positions the snake to eat the food on turn 13 via down (D) to (5,1).\n  - Moving D to (4,1) or L to (3,2) delays eating and risks trapping the snake in the bottom-left area near the obstacle or walls.\n- **Eating the Food (Turn 13)**: Moving D to (5,1) eats the food, increasing the score by +1 and snake length to 7. This is safe as the head is not adjacent to the tail, avoiding tail reward danger.\n- **Post-Eating Survival (Turns 14+)**: After eating, the snake must navigate to open areas (right and up) to avoid dead ends. Moving right (R) to (6,1) on turn 14 is the only safe choice from (5,1), as other directions are blocked. Subsequent moves up (U) to (6,2), (6,3), etc., follow the only available path, leveraging the grid's right side for space. This path ensures survival for many turns by moving toward less cluttered areas.\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus**: The sequence prioritizes eating the food early (turn 13) to secure the point, then focuses on survival by moving to open cells. With no other food present, the snake can safely navigate the grid after eating. Planning 5+ turns ahead confirms this path avoids collisions and walls.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 12 to 16):\n- **Turn 12 (t1=12)**: Move R (right) to (5,2). This sets up for food access and avoids the risky (4,1) or (3,2) moves. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 13 (t1+1=13)**: Move D (down) to (5,1) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 7). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 14 (t1+2=14)**: Move R (right) to (6,1). From (5,1), only R is safe (L leads to a dead end, U and D blocked). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 15 (t1+3=15)**: Move U (up) to (6,2). From (6,1), only U is possible (D wall, L body, R wall). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 16 (t1+4=16)**: Move U (up) to (6,3). From (6,2), only U is possible (D body, L body, R wall). This continues the safe upward path. Direction remains U.\n\n### Beyond Turn 16:\nThe snake can continue moving up to (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6) on subsequent turns, then left to (5,6), etc., to explore open areas. This ensures long-term survival as the body follows, freeing space behind. The food is eaten by turn 13, maximizing score with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 13: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 14: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 15: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 16: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 13, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,2), then body segments at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). So the tail is at (5,5). Snake head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (5,2).\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (5,1) with value 1 and life span 7. Since it's turn 13, this food will disappear after 7 turns, so by turn 20 (13 + 7 = 20).\n\n- At (4,3) with value 1 and life span 10. Disappears after 10 turns, so turn 23 (13 + 10 = 23).\n\nBoth foods have value 1, so positive food. But I need to be careful because the food at (4,3) is currently under a body segment. Let me check the snake positions: (4,3) is the third segment, so it's occupied by the snake body right now.\n\nAccording to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for (4,3), since it's under the body, I need to move the body off that cell first before I can eat it.\n\nThe head is at (5,2), moving right. Possible moves: U (up, to (5,3)), D (down, to (5,1)), L (left, to (4,2)), R (right, to (6,2)).\n\nBut I have to consider movement constraints. Current direction is R (right), so I cannot instantly reverse to L (left) because that would be opposite direction. So L is not allowed this turn.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and collisions.\n\nWalls: border cells are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1), so I can't move there.\n\nNow, let's see possible moves from (5,2):\n\n- U: (5,3) – is this safe? y=3 is within 1 to 6, x=5 is within 1 to 6, so no border wall. (3,1) is obstacle, but (5,3) is not (3,1), so ok. Now, is there a body segment? Snake positions: (5,2) head, (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). So (5,3) is not occupied by any body segment currently. After moving, the tail will move, so I need to think about the new positions after move.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. The tail is removed, but if I eat food, the tail doesn't remove, so snake grows.\n\nBut for collision, I only care about the positions after the move, except that the tail moves, so it's safe to move to where the tail was, as long as it's not part of the body anymore.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,3), let's see what happens.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nAfter move U to (5,3):\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- Then body: (5,2) [previous head], (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) – and tail (5,5) is gone? No: when snake moves, the tail moves to the second last position, but since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nStandard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo after moving U:\n\n- Head to (5,3)\n\n- Segment 1 (was head) to (5,2)\n\n- Segment 2 (was (4,2)) to (4,2) – no, let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (5,4), 5: tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move, new head at (5,3), then body: position 0 moves to (5,3), so segment 1 is now at old position 0: (5,2), segment 2 at old position 1: (4,2), segment 3 at old position 2: (4,3), segment 4 at old position 3: (4,4), segment 5 at old position 4: (5,4), and old position 5 (tail) is removed. So new positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). Tail is now (5,4).\n\nThe cells occupied are (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). (4,3) is still occupied, but it's a body segment, not head.\n\nFor collision, head must not collide with any body segment except the tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move where tail was.\n\nIn this case, (5,3) is empty now? Before move, (5,3) was empty, I think. Let's list all occupied cells before move: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). So (5,3) is free.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), new positions: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). So (4,3) is still occupied, but by a body segment, not head. Head is at (5,3), which was free.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBack to possible moves from (5,2) at turn 13:\n\n- U: to (5,3) – y=3, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by body (since only (4,3) is occupied, but different cell). (4,3) is occupied, but (5,3) is not, so safe to move to (5,3).\n\n- D: to (5,1) – y=1, not border (border y=0, so y=1 is ok), not obstacle (obstacle at (3,1), not (5,1)), not occupied by body (bodies at y=2,3,4,5, not y=1), and there is food at (5,1) with value 1. But if I move down, I eat the food, since head moves to (5,1) which has food.\n\nFood at (5,1), and I move to it, so I eat it.\n\nBut I need to check for tail reward danger. Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,5). Head at (5,2). Are they adjacent? (5,2) and (5,5) – same x, y differs by 3, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. So (5,2) adjacent to (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2). Tail (5,5) is not adjacent to head (5,2), since |dy|=3.\n\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\nIf I move D to (5,1), I eat the food, snake grows, so new length: after move, head to (5,1), body: old head (5,2) becomes segment 1, then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) – but since food eaten, tail not removed, so snake has 7 segments: positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). So the body includes (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,1) has food, which I eat, so it's fine.\n\n- L: left to (4,2) – but current direction is R, moving to L is opposite, so not allowed. Cannot instantly reverse.\n\n- R: right to (6,2) – x=6, not border (x=7 is border, so x=6 is ok), y=2, not wall. Is it occupied? Bodies at x=4,5, y=2,3,4,5. (6,2) not occupied, so safe.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nAlso, x=7 is border, so (6,2) is fine.\n\nNow, food at (5,1) and (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has food, but it's under the body segment. Currently, (4,3) is occupied by the third segment, so I cannot eat it directly. I need to move the body away first.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the segment at (4,3) moves, then the cell is free, and later I can move head to it.\n\nBut for now, at turn 13, I have to choose a move.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nSo positions: let's sketch y from 7 to 0 top to bottom? Usually y increases up, but in coordinates, often y=0 bottom, but for visualization, I'll assume y=0 bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right. But in the state, it doesn't specify, but for movement, it's fine.\n\nSo at y=2: x=4 and x=5 occupied\n\ny=3: x=4 occupied\n\ny=4: x=4 and x=5 occupied? (4,4) and (5,4) but (5,4) is at y=4 x=5\n\nList:\n\n- y=5: (5,5) tail\n\n- y=4: (4,4) and (5,4) — (4,4) is body, (5,4) is body\n\n- y=3: (4,3) body\n\n- y=2: (5,2) head, (4,2) body\n\nSo the snake is like: from head (5,2) right, then left to (4,2), down to (4,3), down to (4,4), then right to (5,4), up to (5,5)? (5,4) to (5,5) is up, but y increasing? Let's see coordinates.\n\nAssume (x,y) with x horizontal, y vertical. y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSo head at (5,2), which is x=5, y=2.\n\nThen next segment (4,2) x=4,y=2, so left.\n\nThen (4,3) x=4,y=3, so up.\n\nThen (4,4) x=4,y=4, up.\n\nThen (5,4) x=5,y=4, right.\n\nThen (5,5) x=5,y=5, up. Tail.\n\nSo snake shape: from (5,2) to (4,2) left, then to (4,3) up, to (4,4) up, to (5,4) right, to (5,5) up.\n\nNow food: (5,1) at x=5,y=1, which is below head, since head at y=2, so (5,1) is down.\n\nAnd (4,3) at x=4,y=3, which is currently occupied by body segment.\n\nLife span: (5,1) life span 7, so disappears turn 20.\n\n(4,3) life span 10, disappears turn 23.\n\nNow, I need to choose action for turn 13.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (since L not allowed, reverse).\n\nU: to (5,3)\n\nD: to (5,1) and eat food\n\nR: to (6,2)\n\nIf I go D to (5,1), I eat the food immediately, grow to length 7, and get +1 score. But I need to think long-term.\n\nAfter eating, snake is at (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nNow, from there, I can move U, L, R (since head dir was D? After moving D, the new head direction is D, so I cannot move U next turn if I want, but not necessarily.\n\nAfter move, the head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nSo if I move D, new head direction is D.\n\nThen possible moves: from (5,1), move D: but y=1, D to (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid, cannot move to wall.\n\nMove L to (4,1) – is it free? (4,1) not occupied, but obstacle? Obstacle at (3,1), not (4,1). Walls: border y=0, but (4,1) is y=1, not border. Internal obstacle only (3,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\nMove R to (6,1) – free.\n\nMove U to (5,2) – but (5,2) is now a body segment, so if I move U, I collide with body at (5,2). After eating, positions include (5,2), so moving to (5,2) would be collision.\n\nAfter move D to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied by body, so moving U to (5,2) is death.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (4,1) or R to (6,1) or D to (5,0) which is wall, death.\n\nSo only possible moves from (5,1) are L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nNow, if I go to (4,1), or (6,1).\n\nBut I have the food at (4,3) to consider.\n\n(4,3) has food, but it's under body now. After moving, the body segment that was at (4,3) is now at (4,3) in the new positions? After move to (5,1), positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). So (4,3) is still occupied by a body segment, and food is there, but not accessible yet.\n\nTo eat (4,3), I need to move the snake so that the body moves off (4,3), then head can move to it.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (4,3) will move when the snake moves, depending on the path.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the body shifts.\n\nBut let's think about the other moves.\n\nIf I go U to (5,3) at turn 13.\n\nAfter move U to (5,3): new positions head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). Tail (5,5) removed, so length 6 still.\n\n(5,5) is removed, so positions: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\n(4,3) is occupied by body, but food is there, not eaten.\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), but (5,4) is body segment, occupied, so if move U, collide and die.\n\nD to (5,2), but (5,2) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nL to (4,3), but (4,3) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nR to (6,3) – (6,3) is free? x=6,y=3, not wall, not occupied (bodies at x=4,5 y=2,3,4), so (6,3) free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (6,3).\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut if I go U, then I'm forced to go R to (6,3), and the snake is now at (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) after move? After move to (6,3): head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (5,4) was tail, removed? Positions after U move: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nThen move R to (6,3): new head (6,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (5,4) removed.\n\nSo positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,3) still occupied.\n\nNow, food at (4,3) is still under body.\n\nIf I go R directly from start to (6,2) at turn 13.\n\nMove R to (6,2): head to (6,2), then body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). (5,5) removed.\n\nPositions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nHead direction now R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,3) – free? (6,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\nD to (6,1) – free.\n\nL to (5,2) – but (5,2) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nCannot reverse to L since current dir R.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf U to (6,3), or D to (6,1).\n\nNow, back to long-term.\n\nI need to eat the foods, but (5,1) is easy to eat, but if I eat it, I grow, and I might be trapped or something.\n\nAlso, (4,3) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nLet's think how to free (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to where the previous segment was, depending on the movement.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, the body follows.\n\nThe segment at (4,3) will move to the position of the next segment towards head, which is (4,2) or something.\n\nLet's see the order: segments: head (5,2), then seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), etc.\n\nWhen head moves, seg1 moves to old head position, seg2 moves to old seg1 position, and so on.\n\nSo for seg2 at (4,3), it will move to where seg1 was, which is (4,2) if head moves.\n\nIn general, to free a cell under body, I need to move the snake so that the segment on it moves away, and the cell is empty for a turn, then head can move to it.\n\nBut it might take multiple turns.\n\nAlso, for (4,3), the food has life span 10, so it will be there until turn 23, 10 turns from now, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) has life span 7, disappears turn 20.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (5,1) soon, it might disappear, but I have 7 turns.\n\nBut eating it gives +1, and grows snake, which might make it harder to maneuver, but also longer snake might be riskier.\n\nCurrently snake length 6.\n\nGrid is 8x8 with walls, so 64 cells, but some walls, but borders are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, minus obstacle at (3,1).\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, but (3,1) obstacle, so 36 -1 = 35 cells? 6x6=36, minus one obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 6, so many cells free.\n\nAfter eating one food, length 7, still ok.\n\nBut I need to plan to eat both if possible.\n\nFirst, let's consider not eating (5,1) immediately, and go for other moves.\n\nIf I go U or R, I don't eat (5,1), and it might disappear later.\n\nBut I can come back to eat it.\n\nFor example, if I go R to (6,2), then I can go D to (6,1), then I can go L to (5,1) to eat it, but let's see.\n\nFrom (6,2), if I go D to (6,1), then head at (6,1), dir D.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (5,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut (5,1) has food, so I eat it and grow.\n\nBut when? Turn sequence.\n\nTurn 13: move to (6,2)\n\nPositions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nHead dir R.\n\nTurn 14: move D to (6,1)\n\nNew head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — (5,4) removed.\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen turn 15: move L to (5,1) — (5,1) has food, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — and since food eaten, no remove, so add (4,4)? Standard: after eating, the tail doesn't remove, so positions: head (5,1), then previous positions except tail not removed.\n\nBefore move to (5,1), positions were head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nAfter move L to (5,1): head to (5,1), which has food, so snake grows: new head (5,1), then body: old head (6,1) becomes segment 1, then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — and tail not removed, so positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nLength 7.\n\n(4,4) is the last, but in the list, (4,4) is part of body.\n\nNow, food at (4,3) is still under body? (4,3) is occupied by body segment.\n\nIn positions, (4,3) is the sixth segment, so occupied.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the body off.\n\nBut at turn 15, head at (5,1), dir L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2) — but (5,2) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nD to (5,0) — y=0 wall, die.\n\nL to (4,1) — (4,1) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nR to (6,1) — but (6,1) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (4,1).\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or something, but (4,2) is body, so need to be careful.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), positions: head to (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) — (4,4) removed since no food.\n\nAfter move to (4,1): head (4,1), then old head (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) — and (4,4) removed.\n\nSo positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(4,3) still occupied, and food there.\n\nHead at (4,1), dir L.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (4,2) — but (4,2) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nD to (4,0) — y=0 wall, die.\n\nL to (3,1) — but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, die.\n\nR to (5,1) — (5,1) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nAll moves deadly? U to (4,2) body, D to wall, L to obstacle, R to body.\n\nI'm trapped! Snake dies.\n\nIf at turn 13 I go R to (6,2), then D to (6,1), then L to (5,1) to eat, but then at (5,1) I can only go L to (4,1), but from (4,1) I have no safe move, all directions blocked or body.\n\nThus, eating (5,1) in this way leads to death on turn 16 or something.\n\nTurn 13: move R to (6,2)\n\nTurn 14: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 15: move L to (5,1) eat food\n\nThen turn 16: must move, but from (5,1), only L to (4,1) is possible? And from (4,1), no move, but at turn 16, from (5,1), after eating, positions include (6,1), (6,2), etc., so moving L to (4,1) is possible, but then at (4,1), next turn, all moves are invalid, so I die when I try to move on turn 17.\n\nTurn 16: from (5,1), move L to (4,1), which is free at that time, so I move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nThen turn 17: from (4,1), I need to move, but U to (4,2) body, D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) obstacle, R to (5,1) body, all bad, so I die.\n\nTherefore, if I eat (5,1) via this path, I die soon after.\n\nNot good for long-term survival.\n\nIf at turn 14, from (6,2), I go U to (6,3) instead of D.\n\nTurn 13: move R to (6,2)\n\nTurn 14: move U to (6,3)\n\nPositions: after turn 13: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nAfter turn 14 U to (6,3): head (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — (5,4) removed.\n\nHead dir U.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) free? Not occupied.\n\nD to (6,2): but (6,2) is body segment, occupied, die if move there.\n\nU to (6,4): free? (6,4) not occupied.\n\nSo possible U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n\nBut not directly helping to eat (5,1) or (4,3).\n\n(5,1) is still there, but I need to go down.\n\nFrom (6,3), if I go L to (5,3), then from (5,3) I can go D to (5,2) but (5,2) might be body, etc.\n\nComplicated.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (5,1) first, or at all, because it might be risky.\n\nAnother option: at turn 13, go D directly to (5,1) and eat.\n\nThen head at (5,1), dir D.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — since eaten, tail not removed.\n\nNow, possible moves: L to (4,1) or R to (6,1), as I thought earlier.\n\nCannot go U to (5,2) body, or D to (5,0) wall.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nSuppose I go R to (6,1).\n\nThen head to (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — (5,5) removed? After eating at (5,1), positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nMove R to (6,1): new head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — (5,5) removed since no food this move.\n\nSo positions: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen from (6,1), possible moves: U to (6,2) — (6,2) free? Not occupied.\n\nD to (6,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) — (5,1) is body, occupied, die.\n\nR to (7,1) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,2).\n\nMove U to (6,2): head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — (5,4) removed.\n\nPositions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nHead dir U.\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3) free? Yes.\n\nD to (6,1) body, occupied, die.\n\nL to (5,2) body, occupied, die.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,3).\n\nAnd so on. I can keep going up, but I'm moving away from the other food, and (4,3) is still under body.\n\nIf at (5,1) after eating, I go L to (4,1) instead.\n\nTurn 13: D to (5,1) eat\n\nTurn 14: L to (4,1)\n\nPositions after turn 13 eat: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nMove L to (4,1): new head (4,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — (5,5) removed.\n\nPositions: (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nHead dir L.\n\nNow from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) — but (4,2) is body segment, occupied, die if move there.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) — (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nR to (5,1) — (5,1) is body, occupied, die.\n\nAll moves invalid! So I die immediately on turn 15.\n\nWorse.\n\nTherefore, eating (5,1) directly and then moving left leads to instant death.\n\nMoving right might be better, but I'm stuck going up and away.\n\nBut I have the food at (4,3) to consider, which has longer life span.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (5,1) and focus on freeing (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is currently occupied by a body segment. The segment at (4,3) will move when the snake moves, to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, if I move the head in a way that the body shifts.\n\nThe cell (4,3) can be freed if the segment that is on it moves away.\n\nCurrently, at position index: let's say segment 2 is at (4,3) (with head as 0, then 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,5))\n\nWhen head moves, seg2 will move to where seg1 was, which is (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied by seg1, but when seg1 moves, it leaves (4,2), so after move, seg2 will be at (4,2) if seg1 was at (4,2) and moved to old head position.\n\nFor example, if head moves to a new position, seg1 moves to old head (5,2), so (4,2) is vacated, then seg2 moves to (4,2), so (4,3) is vacated.\n\nThen the cell (4,3) is free for that turn.\n\nThen on the next turn, if I can move head to (4,3), I can eat the food.\n\nBut the head needs to be able to move to (4,3) at that time.\n\nSo let's see from current state.\n\nAt turn 13, head at (5,2), dir R.\n\nIf I move, say, U to (5,3).\n\nThen after move: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — (5,5) removed.\n\nNow, seg1 was at (4,2), moved to (5,2) (old head).\n\nSeg2 was at (4,3), moved to old seg1 position (4,2).\n\nSeg3 was at (4,4), moved to old seg2 position (4,3).\n\nSo new positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\n(4,3) is now occupied by the body segment that moved from (4,4)? Seg3 moved to (4,3), so (4,3) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n\nThe cell (4,3) is still occupied after the move.\n\nNot free.\n\nIf I move D to (5,1), but we saw it's risky.\n\nMove R to (6,2).\n\nAfter move: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — (5,5) removed.\n\nSeg1 moved to (5,2), seg2 moved to (4,2), seg3 moved to (4,3), so (4,3) still occupied.\n\nSame thing.\n\nTo free (4,3), I need the segment on it to move and not be replaced immediately.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body follows, so the cell is only free if the tail moves off and not replaced, but for a middle segment, it's tricky.\n\n(4,3) is not the tail; tail is at (5,5).\n\nWhen the tail moves, the last cell is freed, but for (4,3), it's not tail.\n\nThe only way to free a body-occupied food cell is to have the segment on it be the tail at some point, or to move in a way that the segment leaves and no one takes its place immediately.\n\nBut in snake, when a body segment moves, it leaves its cell, and the next segment moves to that cell, so it's occupied continuously unless it's the tail.\n\nThe tail cell is freed when the tail moves.\n\nFor a middle cell, it's always occupied unless the snake shortens, but we don't have negative food here.\n\nSo for (4,3), since it's not the tail, it will remain occupied as long as the snake is there, because some body segment will be on it.\n\nOnly when the tail is on that cell and moves, it becomes free.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (5,5), not on (4,3).\n\nTo make (4,3) the tail, I need to move the snake so that the segment on (4,3) becomes the tail, which means I need to have the snake straighten or something so that (4,3) is the last segment.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the tail moves away, and the segment at (4,3) is not followed, but in snake, the body is connected, so the segment at (4,3) will always be followed by the next until tail.\n\nThe only way to free a cell is to have the tail on it and move the tail away.\n\nFor (4,3) to be freed, it must be the tail position at some point.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,5).\n\nI need to move the snake so that (4,3) becomes the tail.\n\nThat means the segment currently at (4,3) must be the last one, so I need to have the snake consume the segments after it, but I can't, unless I hit something, but I don't want to die.\n\nPerhaps by moving, the tail moves, and if I can arrange that the body segment at (4,3) is left behind, but in snake, it's a chain, so when the head moves, the tail moves, all segments shift.\n\nThe only cell freed is the previous tail cell.\n\nFor example, when I move, the old tail cell is freed.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (5,5), so if I move, (5,5) is freed, but (4,3) is not freed because it's occupied by a different segment now.\n\nSpecifically, after any move, the cell that was the tail is now free, but other cells may change occupancy but not freed unless tail was on them.\n\nFor the food at (4,3), since it's under a body segment, it can only be eaten if that cell becomes free and head moves to it.\n\nTo make it free, that cell must be the tail position at some point, so that when the tail moves, it becomes free.\n\nCurrently, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is at (5,5).\n\nI need to move the snake so that the segment on (4,3) becomes the tail.\n\nThat means I need to have the snake straighten or change shape so that (4,3) is the last segment.\n\nFor example, if I move the head such that the body unwinds or something.\n\nLet's see the current shape: head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nIf I move the head up to (5,3), then positions: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nTail at (5,4)\n\n(4,3) still body.\n\nThen if I move right to (6,3), positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\n(4,3) still body.\n\nThen if I move up to (6,4), positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3)\n\nAh, now tail is at (4,3)!\n\nAt this point, the food at (4,3) is under the tail.\n\nNow, on the next turn, if I move the head, the tail will move, freeing (4,3), and if I can move the head to (4,3), I can eat the food.\n\nBut when I move the head, the tail moves simultaneously, so the cell is freed after the move, but for eating, I need to move head to it when it's free.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nSuppose at some turn, tail is on the food cell.\n\nThen, when I move the head to a new position, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, so the old tail cell is freed.\n\nAt the same time, the head moves to a new cell.\n\nIf the head moves to the old tail cell (which has food), it can eat it.\n\nBut the head and tail are different cells, so head moving to old tail cell might not be possible if not adjacent.\n\nIn this case, when tail is on (4,3), and I move head, the head moves away, tail moves to new position, freeing (4,3), but head is not on (4,3), so I can't eat it that turn.\n\nThen on the next turn, (4,3) is free, and I can move head to it if adjacent.\n\nBack to the sequence.\n\nFrom earlier, after moving to have tail at (4,3).\n\nFrom current turn 13.\n\nIf I move U to (5,3): positions (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)  -- tail at (5,4)\n\nHead at (5,3), dir U.\n\nThen move R to (6,3): positions (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)  -- tail at (4,4)\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen move U to (6,4): positions (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)  -- tail at (4,3)\n\nNow, at this point, tail is at (4,3), which has food.\n\nHead at (6,4), dir U.\n\nNow, on this turn, say turn 15, I need to move the head.\n\nIf I move head to, say, (6,5) or (5,4) or (7,4) but x=7 wall, or (6,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is not adjacent to head (6,4), so I cannot move directly to (4,3).\n\nWhen I move, tail moves from (4,3) to new position, freeing (4,3), but head moves to different cell.\n\nSo after move, (4,3) is free.\n\nThen on next turn, I can move head to (4,3) if possible.\n\nBut head at (6,4), (4,3) is not adjacent; they are at distance, so I need to get closer.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) invalid.\n\n(5,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrent positions before move: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nSo (5,4) is free.\n\nL to (5,4) is possible.\n\nD to (6,3) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (6,5) free.\n\nR invalid.\n\nSo I can move L to (5,4) or U to (6,5).\n\nSay I move L to (5,4): head to (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) -- tail was at (4,3), moves to old position of second last, which was (4,2), so new tail at (4,2), and (4,3) freed.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nAnd (4,3) is free, with food.\n\nHead at (5,4), dir L (since moved left from (6,4)? Head was at (6,4), moved L to (5,4), so dir L.\n\nNow, (4,3) is adjacent to head? (5,4) and (4,3) are not adjacent; (5,4) to (4,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells share edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (5,4), adjacent cells: U (5,5), D (5,3), L (4,4), R (6,4) but (6,4) body.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is down-left, not directly adjacent.\n\nSo I cannot move directly to (4,3) from (5,4).\n\nI need to move to a cell adjacent to (4,3).\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can move D to (5,3), but (5,3) is body segment, occupied, die.\n\nMove U to (5,5) free.\n\nMove L to (4,4) free? (4,4) not occupied, in positions above, (4,4) is not in the list, so free.\n\nPositions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) so (4,4) free.\n\nMove L to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nLet's sequence turns.\n\nAssume we are at the point where tail is at (4,3).\n\nTurn 13: move U to (5,3) from initial.\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 15: move U to (6,4)  -- now tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 16: move L to (5,4)  -- head to (5,4), tail moves to (4,2), (4,3) freed.\n\nPositions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nFood at (4,3) free.\n\nHead at (5,4), dir L.\n\nTurn 17: I can move L to (4,4)  -- (4,4) free, so move to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) -- (4,2) removed.\n\nPositions: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nHead dir L.\n\nNow from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\n(4,3) has food, and is free.\n\nMove D to (4,3): head to (4,3), eat food, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) -- and since food eaten, no remove, so add (5,2)? Positions: head (4,3), body old head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) -- tail not removed, so all segments, length 7.\n\nBut (5,2) is included.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), dir D.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut in this process, I didn't eat the (5,1) food, which has shorter life span.\n\n(5,1) life span 7, from turn 13, disappears turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence above, by turn 17, it's turn 17, which is after turn 20? Turn 13 +4 =17, turn 17, but turn 20 is when it disappears, so at turn 17, (5,1) is still there if not eaten, life span decreases each turn.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 13, so at turn 14, life span 6, ..., at turn 20, life span 0, disappears.\n\nAt turn 17, life span 7 - (17-13) = 7-4=3, still there.\n\nBut in the sequence, I was not near (5,1), so I might not eat it.\n\nBut I can try to eat it before or after.\n\nSince (5,1) is easier, but earlier attempts led to death, so perhaps avoid it.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 13, go D to (5,1) but then immediately go right or left to avoid trap.\n\nBut when I go D to (5,1), I can only go L or R.\n\nIf I go R to (6,1), then I can go U to (6,2), etc., as before, and I'm away from the death trap.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can move to other areas.\n\nBut the (4,3) food is still there.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,1) and then later free (4,3).\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nTurn 13: if I go D to (5,1) eat, then turn 14 go R to (6,1), then turn 15 go U to (6,2), then turn 16 go U to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut at some point, I need to free (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is under body, and with longer snake, it might be harder.\n\nSince (5,1) has shorter life, I should eat it if possible without dying.\n\nBut from the initial position, if I go D to (5,1), then go R to (6,1), then U to (6,2), then from (6,2) I can go U to (6,3) or L to (5,2) but (5,2) body, so U to (6,3).\n\nPositions after turn 13 D to (5,1): (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nTurn 14 R to (6,1): head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) -- (5,5) removed.\n\nTurn 15 U to (6,2): head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) -- (5,4) removed.\n\nTurn 16 U to (6,3): head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) -- (4,4) removed.\n\nNow tail at (4,3), which has food.\n\nHead at (6,3), dir U.\n\nTurn 17: move head, say L to (5,3) or U to (6,4), etc.\n\nIf I move, tail moves from (4,3), freeing it.\n\nThen on turn 18, I can move head to (4,3) if possible.\n\nHead at (6,3), (4,3) is not adjacent, so I need to get closer.\n\nFrom (6,3), move L to (5,3): (5,3) free? Positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) so (5,3) free.\n\nMove L to (5,3): head to (5,3), body (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2) -- tail was (4,3) moves to old second last (4,2), so new positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2) and (4,3) freed.\n\nHead at (5,3), dir L.\n\nTurn 18: from (5,3), I can move D to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, occupied, die.\n\nU to (5,4) free.\n\nL to (4,3) -- (4,3) is free, has food, so move to (4,3) and eat.\n\nMove L to (4,3): head to (4,3), eat food, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2) -- and since food eaten, no remove, so add (4,2)? Positions: head (4,3), body old head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2) -- and the last segment (4,2) not removed, so positions: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) is included, and head at (4,3), so the body includes (5,3), etc., and (4,2) is tail.\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen I can continue, e.g., move D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, or U to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I have eaten both foods, and survived.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate (5,1) at turn 13 and (4,3) at turn 18.\n\nAnd no death.\n\nThe key was to go right after eating (5,1) to avoid the trap.\n\nThen later free the tail at (4,3) and eat it.\n\nNow, for the initial move at turn 13, I should go D to (5,1) to eat the food.\n\nThen the sequence can follow.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output actions, I should output a sequence.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a plan for several turns.\n\nBut I don't know how many, but at least for turn 13 and a few ahead.\n\nSince the state changes, I can provide the immediate action and perhaps the next few.\n\nBut for safety, I can provide the sequence I have.\n\nFirst, at turn 13, move D to eat (5,1).\n\nThen turn 14, move R to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 15, move U to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 16, move U to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 17, move L to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 18, move L to (4,3) to eat the other food.\n\nBut at turn 18, eating (4,3).\n\nNow, are there any risks?\n\nFor example, at turn 17, after moving to (5,3), positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nHead at (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) body, L to (4,3) free, R to (6,3) body.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nI moved L to (4,3) to eat.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), I might miss the food or something, but I can go to (4,3) later, but it might be riskier.\n\nBut moving L directly to eat is fine.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: when I move to (4,3), head is at (5,3), tail at (4,2), which is adjacent: (5,3) and (4,2) are not adjacent; (5,3) to (4,2) is diagonal. Adjacent cells: (4,3) is left, (5,4) up, (5,2) down, (6,3) right.\n\nTail at (4,2), which is down-left, not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nThen after eating, head at (4,3), tail at (4,2)? Positions after eating: head (4,3), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nSo head at (4,3), tail at (4,2), which are adjacent vertically? (4,3) and (4,2) same x, y differ by 1, so yes, adjacent.\n\nBut tail reward danger only if I eat food on the tail cell when head adjacent to tail.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (4,3), the food is on (4,3), and tail is at (4,2), which is adjacent, and I eat the food, which is positive, so according to rule, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, when I move head to (4,3), which has food, and tail is at (4,2), which is adjacent, so eating it should cause death.\n\nOh no! I forgot that.\n\nSo in turn 18, from (5,3), moving L to (4,3), but tail is at (4,2), which is adjacent to (4,3)? (4,3) and (4,2) share an edge, so yes, adjacent.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (4,3) when tail is adjacent will kill the snake.\n\nSo I cannot eat it that way.\n\nProblem.\n\nTo avoid tail reward danger, I need to eat the food when the tail is not adjacent.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move to (4,3), tail is at (4,2), adjacent, so danger.\n\nI need to arrange that when I eat (4,3), the tail is not adjacent.\n\nFor example, from the position where tail is at (4,3), and head is at (6,4) or something, not adjacent.\n\nThen when I move, tail moves, freeing (4,3), and head moves elsewhere.\n\nThen later, when head is not adjacent to tail, I can move to (4,3).\n\nBut in the grid, I need to be able to reach it.\n\nFor instance, in the first sequence where I didn't eat (5,1).\n\nAt turn 15: after moves, head at (6,4), tail at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\nTurn 16: move to (5,4), freeing (4,3).\n\nHead at (5,4), tail at (4,2), not adjacent to (4,3)?

Instead, the focus is on safely eating the food at (4,3) by first maneuvering the snake to free the cell and then moving the head onto it, avoiding tail reward danger. The food at (5,1) has a shorter life span (disappears at turn 20) but is too risky to eat without causing death; thus, it is avoided for survival. The sequence below ensures the snake survives and eats the positive food at (4,3) around turn 18, with a plan extending 5+ turns ahead.\n\n### Key Points from Analysis:\n- **Immediate Risk at (5,1)**: Moving down (D) to eat (5,1) on turn 13 often leads to death by turn 15-17 due to limited escape routes (e.g., after eating, moving left traps the snake at (4,1) with no safe moves). Moving right (R) first and then attempting to eat (5,1) also causes death.\n- **Freeing (4,3)**: The food at (4,3) is under a body segment and can only be eaten once the cell is freed. This requires moving the snake so that (4,3) becomes the tail position, then moving the tail away to free the cell, and finally moving the head to (4,3) when it is not adjacent to the tail to avoid tail reward danger.\n- **Movement Constraints**: The current head direction is right (R), so moving left (L) is not allowed on turn 13 (no instant reverse). Wall and obstacle constraints are respected (border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (3,1)).\n- **Long-Term Sequence**: \n  - Turn 13: Move up (U) to (5,3) to avoid the (5,1) risk and start repositioning.\n  - Turn 14: Only safe move is right (R) to (6,3), avoiding body collisions.\n  - Turn 15: Move up (U) to (6,4) to continue toward freeing (4,3).\n  - Turn 16: Move left (L) to (5,4) to position for freeing (4,3).\n  - Turn 17: Move left (L) to (4,4) to set up eating (4,3).\n  - Turn 18: Move down (D) to (4,3) to eat the food safely, as the tail is not adjacent (no tail reward danger).\n\nThis sequence ensures (4,3) is freed and eaten by turn 18, with the snake surviving. The food at (5,1) expires unused at turn 20 but is sacrificed for survival. After turn 18, the snake can continue exploring the grid.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 13 to 18):\n- **Turn 13**: U (up) – Move to (5,3), avoiding down to prevent death risk. Head direction now U.\n- **Turn 14**: R (right) – Move to (6,3); only safe move (U/D/L would cause collision). Head direction now R.\n- **Turn 15**: U (up) – Move to (6,4); only safe move (D/L/R would cause collision or wall). Head direction now U.\n- **Turn 16**: L (left) – Move to (5,4); safe and positions for freeing (4,3). Head direction now L.\n- **Turn 17**: L (left) – Move to (4,4); safe and adjacent to (4,3) for eating next turn. Head direction now L.\n- **Turn 18**: D (down) – Move to (4,3) to eat food; tail is at (5,2), not adjacent (no tail reward danger). Head direction now D.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: R \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: L \\\\\nTurn 17: L \\\\\nTurn 18: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 14, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and (0,0) is probably the bottom-left or top-left? I should assume coordinates where (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? In grid problems, (0,0) is often top-left, but in this context, since the snake is moving up and down, I should clarify.\n\nThe snake positions are given: head at (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). And head direction is U, which is up. Up means increasing y if (0,0) is bottom-left? But typically in programming, (0,0) is top-left with y increasing down, but here the movement says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so U increases y, which suggests that (0,0) might be bottom-left, with y increasing upwards. Let me confirm.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1), so if y increases, it's going up, so (0,0) is likely bottom-left, meaning lower y is bottom, higher y is top. For example, from (5,3) moving U to (5,4) would be up, increasing y. But in the snake positions, head is at (5,3), and after that is (5,2), which is down, so the tail is at (5,4), which is above? Let's list the positions:\n\n- Head: (5,3) direction U\n\n- Next: (5,2) — that's directly below, since y=2 < y=3, so if y increases up, (5,2) is south of (5,3).\n\ny=2 and y=3, with U being (x,y+1), so from (5,3) moving U would go to (5,4). But the next segment is (5,2), which is at lower y, so that means the snake was moving down before, but now head direction is U, so it changed.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, meaning it just moved up or is about to move up? The direction is given as current head direction, which I think is the direction it moved to get to the current head position, or the direction it's facing for the next move? I need to clarify.\n\nThe input says: \"Snake Head Direction: U\" and it's for the current state. In Snake games, the head direction is the direction it's facing, and you choose the next move based on that.\n\nAlso, for movement, it says \"in each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in directions: U, D, L, R\", and \"no instant reverse\", meaning if current direction is U, you can't choose D next, etc.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so from position (5,3), if it moves U, it goes to (5,4), but let's see the snake body: positions are [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)]\n\nSo let's plot this on a grid. Assume (0,0) bottom-left, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nHead at (5,3), which is x=5, y=3.\n\nNext segment: (5,2) — that's directly below, y=2.\n\nThen (4,2) — left to x=4, y=2.\n\nThen (4,3) — up to y=3.\n\nThen (4,4) — up to y=4.\n\nThen (5,4) — right to x=5, y=4.\n\nNow, the tail is at (5,4), which is above the head? Head at (5,3), tail at (5,4), so y=4 > y=3, so if y increases up, tail is north of head.\n\nBut the segments: from head (5,3) to (5,2) down, to (4,2) left, to (4,3) up, to (4,4) up, to (5,4) right. So the snake body forms a sort of shape.\n\nNow, head direction is U, meaning it is currently facing up, so last move was probably up to (5,3), but let's see: positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), so the previous position was (5,2), and it moved to (5,3), which is up, since y from 2 to 3 increased, so direction to current head is U, so current head direction is U.\n\nFor the next move, I can choose U, L, or R, but not D, because D is reverse of U.\n\nNo instant reverse: if current direction is U, cannot move D next. So possible moves from (5,3) with dir U: U (to (5,4)), L (to (4,3)), R (to (6,3)).\n\nBut (6,3) might be out of bounds? Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7. So x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nx=7 is wall, so R to (6,3): x=6, which is less than 7, so (6,3) is within bounds since x=0 to 7 inclusive? Border cells x=0/x=7, meaning x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6? No.\n\n\"Cells occupied by walls: Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\"\n\nIt says \"x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", which probably means cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0), (0,1), ..., (0,7), (7,0), ..., (7,7), (1,0), (2,0), ..., (6,0), and similarly for y=7.\n\nSo the grid has walls on all borders, so valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free? Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free.\n\nBut in the snake positions, we have (5,3), (5,2), etc. y=2 and y=3, which should be within bounds if y=1 to 6 are free, assuming y=0 is wall.\n\ny=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row? Since y=7 is wall.\n\nDefine: if (0,0) is bottom-left, with y increasing up, then:\n\n- y=0: bottom wall\n\n- y=7: top wall\n\n- So free y from 1 to 6\n\nSimilarly x: x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, free x from 1 to 6.\n\nNow snake positions: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\n(5,2) has y=2, which is above y=1? y=1 is bottom, y=6 top, so y=2 is one above bottom.\n\n(5,3) y=3, etc.\n\n(4,4) y=4, (5,4) y=4.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle: [(3,1)], so cell (3,1) is a wall.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,1,6,1) — this is (x,y, life_span, value), so (5,1), life_span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,3,9,1) — (4,3), life_span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied by the snake body! Snake positions include (4,3), which is the fourth segment.\n\nFood positions: (5,1) and (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is currently occupied by the snake body.\n\nAccording to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, for (4,3), life_span is 9, value 1.\n\n(5,1) life_span 6, value 1.\n\nCurrent turn t=14.\n\nLife_span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 14, for (5,1), life_span=6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns? Life_span is how many turns it remains, and decreases each turn.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at the state given, for food (5,1), life_span=6, meaning it will disappear after turn 14 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo when the state is given at turn t, the life_span is the remaining number of turns it will be present, including the current turn. So after current turn, it decreases by 1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span L, it will be present at turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nSince countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, it has L turns left including this one, so after turn t, it has L-1 left, etc., until 0.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3), life_span=9 at turn 14.\n\nNow, (4,3) is occupied by snake body, so it cannot be eaten now. To eat it, the snake must move such that the body segment at (4,3) moves away, and then the head moves to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is the fourth segment in the snake: positions index 0: head (5,3), 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (5,4)\n\nSo (4,3) is the segment at index 3.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So the tail end is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, head moves to new position, body follows, tail is cut off.\n\nIf food eaten at new head position, tail is not cut off, so snake grows by one cell.\n\nNow, for food under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away from that cell, meaning that when the snake moves, if that body segment is no longer there, and then head moves to that cell.\n\nSpecifically, for cell (4,3), it has food, but snake is on it. To eat it, the snake must move in such a way that in some future turn, the segment at (4,3) moves to another position, freeing the cell, and then the head moves to (4,3) before the food disappears.\n\nCurrently at turn 14, head at (5,3) dir U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R (not D, since reverse).\n\nU: to (5,4)\n\nL: to (4,3)\n\nR: to (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,4) is currently occupied by the tail, (5,4) is the last segment.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), since (5,4) is the tail, and it's not food? (5,4) doesn't have food listed, so if I move to (5,4), I would collide with my own body? But rule says: body collision is deadly, but you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if I move to a cell that is the current tail position, and no food there, then after move, head moves to that cell, tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if there is food, it might be eaten.\n\nIn this case, (5,4) is tail position, and no food there, so moving to (5,4) is safe; head goes to (5,4), tail moves from (5,4) to where? After move, the new positions: head to (5,4), then the body: previous head (5,3) becomes segment 1, (5,2) segment 2, (4,2) segment 3, (4,3) segment 4, (4,4) segment 5, and tail (5,4) was segment 5, but since head moved to (5,4), and no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new tail is the previous segment 5, which was (4,4)? Let's index.\n\nCurrent positions: idx 0: (5,3) head, idx 1: (5,2), idx 2: (4,2), idx 3: (4,3), idx 4: (4,4), idx 5: (5,4) tail.\n\nAfter move U to (5,4):\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- Then body: idx 1: old head (5,3)\n\n- idx 2: old idx1 (5,2)\n\n- idx 3: old idx2 (4,2)\n\n- idx 4: old idx3 (4,3)\n\n- idx 5: old idx4 (4,4)\n\n- And old tail (5,4) is removed, so no idx6.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is the new tail.\n\nAnd (5,4) was tail, but head moved there, and since no food, tail is cut, so no collision.\n\nNow, if I move L to (4,3): (4,3) is currently occupied by body segment idx3.\n\nIf I move to (4,3), which is a body segment, not tail, so it would be collision and die, because head touches a body segment that is not the tail.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment except when moving to the tail position.\n\nHere, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is (5,4), so moving to (4,3) would cause collision with body segment, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (6,3): (6,3) is within bounds? x=6, y=3, walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=6 is free, y=3 free, and no body there, so safe.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (5,4): safe, as above\n\n- L to (4,3): unsafe, collision with body\n\n- R to (6,3): safe, empty cell\n\nNow, also, food: (5,1) at (5,1), which is below, y=1.\n\n(4,3) has food, but occupied.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all free cells and food.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is wall.\n\nSnake occupies: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nSo free cells: all except these and walls.\n\nFood: (5,1) at (5,1) with life 6, value +1\n\n(4,3) at (4,3) with life 9, value +1, but occupied.\n\nLife_span: for (5,1), at turn 14, life_span 6, so it will disappear at turn 14 + 6 = 20? Since countdown includes current turn.\n\nAt turn t, life_span L, it is present at turn t, and will disappear after L turns, meaning at turn t+L it is gone.\n\nCountdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, countdown L, after turn t, countdown L-1, ..., after turn t+L-1, countdown 1, then at turn t+L, it disappears.\n\nSo for (5,1), at turn 14, life_span 6, so it will be present until turn 19 (since after turn 19, it disappears). Turns: turn 14: present, countdown 6; after turn 14, countdown 5; turn 15: present, countdown 5; ... after turn 19, countdown 0, disappears at turn 20? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it is present during turn t. After the turn, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nStandard way: at the beginning of state for turn t, food is present with life_span L. During turn t, it can be eaten. If not eaten, at the end of turn, life_span decreases by 1. If life_span becomes 0, it disappears and is not present for turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly for multiple turns.\n\nFor (5,1) at turn 14: life_span 6, so present at turn 14, and if not eaten, life_span decreases to 5 for turn 15, and so on, until turn 19: life_span 1, present, if not eaten, after turn 19, life_span 0, disappears, not present at turn 20.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3): life_span 9 at turn 14, so present until turn 22 if not eaten.\n\nTurn 14: life_span 9, present.\n\nTurn 15: life_span 8, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn 22: life_span 1, present.\n\nTurn 23: not present.\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied, so it can only be eaten if snake moves away and head moves there later.\n\nNow, back to current move.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 14.\n\nPossible actions: U, R (L is unsafe)\n\nIf I go U to (5,4), then new head position (5,4), which was tail, so snake shortens? No, positions: new head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nLength same, no food eaten.\n\nThen head at (5,4) dir U (since I moved U).\n\nNow from there, I can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (5,5), but y=5, which is within 1-6, free.\n\nL to (4,4), which is current tail, so safe if I move there.\n\nR to (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut I need to think about food.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which is below, and life_span 6, so I have until turn 19 to eat it.\n\n(4,3) at (4,3) with life_span 9, so more time.\n\nBut (4,3) is currently occupied, so I need to free it first.\n\nTo free (4,3), the segment there must move away.\n\nCurrently, (4,3) is segment idx3 in the snake.\n\nAs the snake moves, this segment will move based on the path.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a certain way, the body at (4,3) might move to another cell.\n\nThen (4,3) becomes free, and if head moves there before food disappears, I can eat it.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo if I eat food at the tail position, and after eating, the tail is there, but since I grow, a new tail is added, but when I move next, it might collide.\n\nLet's read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the tail cell to eat food, and at that time, the tail is adjacent to the head? The condition is when head is adjacent to the tail, and tail cell has food, eating it causes death because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and new segment is added, so the head is now on the food cell, which was tail, and the tail is still there, so head and tail are on same cell? No.\n\nWhen you eat food at the tail cell: suppose tail is at T, and head moves to T to eat food.\n\nAfter move, head is at T, and since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the previous tail remains, and a new segment is added? No.\n\nStandard Snake: when head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position or something? I need to recall.\n\nTypically in Snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n\nWhen food eaten, head moves to new cell (with food), the tail is not removed, so snake length increases by one; the tail stays, and new positions: head at new, then body follows, with tail fixed.\n\nFor example, if head moves to a food cell, the new snake has head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes new segment 1, and so on, down to the tail, which remains in place, so the snake is one segment longer.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose before move, positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n\nIf move to free cell: new positions: new H, old H, B1, ..., B_{k-1}  (tail removed)\n\nIf move to food: new positions: new H, old H, B1, B2, ..., T  (tail kept, so new segment at old T)\n\nIn the case where head moves to the current tail position to eat food.\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T, and T has food.\n\nHead moves to T.\n\nAfter move: head is at T, then the previous head H becomes segment 1, and so on, the previous tail T is now part of body? Let's see the sequence.\n\nPositions before: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] where T is tail.\n\nWhen head moves to T, which has food.\n\nNew positions: head at T, then previous head H, then B1, B2, ..., Bk, T? But T is the same cell? No, the tail position is now occupied by head, and since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the previous positions are all shifted.\n\nThe new head is at T (the cell).\n\nThen the first body segment is the previous head position H.\n\nThen the next is previous B1, and so on, up to previous Bk.\n\nThen the tail is previous T, but previous T is the cell where head now is, so it's the same cell? Confusion.\n\nPhysically: the cell T had the tail segment. When head moves to T, it occupies that cell. Since food is eaten, the snake grows, so the tail segment is not removed; instead, it stays, but since head is now on T, the tail must be somewhere.\n\nIn the sequence, the position T is now the head, so the previous tail segment is gone, but because of growth, we add a new segment at the end.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the tail does not advance; it stays in place, so the new tail is the old tail.\n\nPositions: before move, snake at S0=H, S1, S2, ..., Sk=T\n\nAfter moving to a food cell: new head at new position P (which is the food cell), then S0 (old head) becomes S1, S1 becomes S2, ..., Sk (old tail) becomes S_{k+1}, and since food eaten, no removal, so new positions: P, S0, S1, S2, ..., Sk\n\nLength increased by one, tail is now at Sk, which was old tail.\n\nIn the case where P = T, the current tail position.\n\nSo before move: head at H, tail at T.\n\nHead moves to T to eat food.\n\nAfter move: new head at T, then old head H becomes segment 1, then the rest, and old tail T becomes the new segment after the old tail? Positions: new head: T\n\nThen: old head H (now segment 1)\n\nThen: old segment 1 (now segment 2)\n\n...\n\nThen: old segment k-1 (now segment k)\n\nThen: old tail T (now segment k+1, the new tail)\n\nBut the new head is at T, and the new tail is also at T? Same cell? That can't be.\n\nMistake.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, it occupies that cell.\n\nIf that cell was the tail, and food is there, after moving, the head is at T, and since food eaten, the tail remains, but the tail was at T, now head is at T, so the cell T has both? No, the segments are sequential.\n\nAfter move, the new position of head is T.\n\nThe first body segment is at old head position H.\n\nThe second body segment is at old position of first body, and so on.\n\nThe last body segment is at old position of the second last body segment.\n\nThen the tail is at the old position of the last body segment? I think I have off-by-one.\n\nAssume indices: positions at time t: let's say S_t[0] = head, S_t[1], S_t[2], ..., S_t[k] = tail.\n\nAfter move to new position P:\n\nIf no food, new positions: S_{t+1}[0] = P, S_{t+1}[1] = S_t[0], S_{t+1}[2] = S_t[1], ..., S_{t+1}[k] = S_t[k-1], and S_t[k] is removed.\n\nIf food eaten at P, new positions: S_{t+1}[0] = P, S_{t+1}[1] = S_t[0], S_{t+1}[2] = S_t[1], ..., S_{t+1}[k+1] = S_t[k], so the tail is S_t[k] at the same position, and length increased.\n\nNow, if P = S_t[k], that is, moving to the tail position to eat food.\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T.\n\nS_t[k] = T.\n\nMove to P = T.\n\nAfter move with food: new head at T, new segment 1 at old head H, new segment 2 at old segment 1, ..., new segment k at old segment k-1, new tail at old tail T.\n\nBut new head is at T, and new tail is also at T? The new tail is at the position of old tail T, but new head is also at T, so collision at T.\n\nYes, that's the point.\n\nIn this case, after the move, the head and the new tail are both at cell T at the same time, which is a collision, so the snake dies.\n\nTherefore, if the head moves to the current tail position to eat food, it causes immediate death because head and tail occupy the same cell after growth.\n\nThe rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide\" — yes.\n\nAlso, the condition is \"if the head is adjacent to the tail\" when eating at tail cell.\n\nIn this case, when head moves to tail cell, it is adjacent only if it was adjacent before, but in the move, if head moves to tail, it must have been adjacent before the move, since it moves one step.\n\nIf head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, moving to it to eat causes death.\n\nIf head is not adjacent to tail, but moves to tail cell, it might not be possible since it can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut in the rule, it specifies \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nSo only when head is currently adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it is deadly.\n\nOtherwise, if tail has food but head is not adjacent, I can move to it later if it becomes adjacent.\n\nIn this state, tail is at (5,4), head at (5,3), so they are adjacent vertically, since (5,3) and (5,4) differ by y=1, so adjacent.\n\nAnd (5,4) does not have food, so no issue.\n\nNow, back to (4,3) which has food, but it is a body segment, not tail.\n\nTo eat it, I need to free the cell first.\n\nLet's think about strategies.\n\nFirst, possible moves at turn 14:\n\n- Move U to (5,4): safe, new head at (5,4), dir U, positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)  (tail at (4,4))\n\n- Move R to (6,3): safe, new head at (6,3), dir R (since I moved right), positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,4)  (tail at (5,4), but (5,4) was tail, now it's body, tail is still (5,4)? After move to (6,3) no food, so new positions: head (6,3), then old head (5,3), then old idx1 (5,2), old idx2 (4,2), old idx3 (4,3), old idx4 (4,4), and tail old idx5 (5,4) removed? Indices: current: 0:(5,3), 1:(5,2), 2:(4,2), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,4), 5:(5,4)\n\nAfter move R to (6,3) no food: new head (6,3), new1: old0 (5,3), new2: old1 (5,2), new3: old2 (4,2), new4: old3 (4,3), new5: old4 (4,4), and old5 (5,4) removed, so new tail at (4,4)\n\nPositions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\nNow, the food at (4,3) is still occupied by new segment new4 (4,3), which is body.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U, food at (4,3) is still occupied.\n\nNow, I need to plan to eat the foods.\n\nFirst, (5,1) is at (5,1), which is south, and life_span 6, so I need to eat it soon.\n\n(4,3) has more time.\n\nAlso, the snake is of length 6, so after eating, it grows.\n\nNow, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, option: move towards (5,1).\n\nTo reach (5,1) from (5,3), I need to go down, but current head direction is U, and I cannot move D directly because no instant reverse.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move L or R or U.\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), then from there, I can move down or other.\n\nBut (5,1) is at y=1, which is the bottom row.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nPath to (5,1): from (5,3), to go down, I need to change direction.\n\nSince I cannot move D now, I have to go left or right first.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, unsafe.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), then head at (5,4), dir U.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), or R to (6,4).\n\n(5,1) is still below.\n\nMoving U takes me away from (5,1).\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), then at (6,3), I can move U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or L to (5,3), but (5,3) is now body, so moving L to (5,3) would be collision, since it's not tail.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3), positions are (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), etc., so (5,3) is the first body segment, so moving back to (5,3) is unsafe.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid, so only U or D.\n\nR to (7,3) invalid, so U or D.\n\nSimilarly, if at (5,4), moves U, L, R.\n\nBut to reach (5,1), I need to go down.\n\nFrom current, if I move R to (6,3), then I can move D to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), I can move D to (6,1), but (6,1) is above y=1, free, then to (5,1)? (5,1) is not directly adjacent to (6,1), need to move left.\n\nFrom (6,2), after moving D to (6,2), head at (6,2) dir D.\n\nThen I can move D to (6,1), L to (5,2), or R to (7,2) invalid, so D or L.\n\nIf move D to (6,1), then at (6,1), I can move L to (5,1) or U to (6,2), but (6,2) is body, or R invalid.\n\nSo if I move L to (5,1), I can eat the food at (5,1).\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,3)\n\nAfter turn 14: head at (6,3), positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail at (4,4)\n\nHead dir R.\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,2)\n\nNew head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail at (4,3)? After move no food: new head (6,2), new1: old head (6,3), new2: old1 (5,3), new3: old2 (5,2), new4: old3 (4,2), new5: old4 (4,3), and old5 (4,4) removed, so tail at (4,3)\n\nBut (4,3) has food, but it's occupied, not eaten.\n\nPositions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3)\n\nHead at (6,2) dir D.\n\nTurn 16: move D to (6,1)\n\nNew head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)? After move no food: new head (6,1), new1: (6,2), new2: (6,3), new3: (5,3), new4: (5,2), new5: (4,2), and old tail (4,3) removed, so tail at (4,2)\n\n(4,3) is now free? After turn 16, (4,3) is not occupied anymore, since tail was removed from there.\n\nIn turn 16 move, when I move to (6,1), no food there, so tail is removed, which was at (4,3), so cell (4,3) is freed.\n\nBut the food at (4,3) is still there, life_span 9 at turn 14, so at turn 16, life_span 7? Let's track.\n\nTurn 14: food (4,3) life 9\n\nAfter turn 14, if not eaten, life decreases to 8 for turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: present, life 8, after turn 15, life 7 for turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: present, life 7.\n\nAfter turn 16 move to (6,1), no food eaten, so at end of turn 16, food (4,3) life decreases to 6 for turn 17.\n\nAnd cell (4,3) is free now.\n\nBack to sequence.\n\nTurn 16: head at (6,1) dir D.\n\nNow (5,1) is at west, adjacent.\n\nI can move L to (5,1) to eat the food.\n\nTurn 17: move L to (5,1)\n\nNow (5,1) has food, value +1, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,1), then previous head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) and since food eaten, no removal, tail at (4,2)\n\nSnake grows to length 7.\n\nHead at (5,1) dir L (since moved left).\n\nNow, the food at (4,3) is free and present.\n\nI can plan to go to (4,3) later.\n\nLife_span at turn 17: food (4,3) life was 9 at turn 14, after decreases: turn 14 to 15: life 8, 15 to 16: life 7, 16 to 17: life 6? At start of turn 17, food (4,3) life 6 (since after turn 16 decrease).\n\nIt will be present until turn 22.\n\nNow, from (5,1), I can move to (4,3) via some path.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,1), so I need to go around.\n\nFirst, this is one option: by moving R at turn 14, I can reach (5,1) by turn 17 and eat it.\n\nWhat about the other move option?\n\nIf I move U at turn 14 to (5,4)\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail\n\nDir U.\n\nThen I need to go down to (5,1), but it's farther.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can move D, but current dir U, cannot move D, reverse.\n\nSo can move U, L, R.\n\nIf move L to (4,4), which is tail, so safe.\n\nNew head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,3) has food, but not eaten yet.\n\nThen from (4,4) dir L, I can move L to (3,4), D to (4,3), or U to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,3) is tail, and has food.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), which is tail and has food, and head at (4,4) is adjacent to tail (4,3), since (4,4) and (4,3) differ y by 1.\n\nSo if I move to (4,3) to eat, it would be deadly because of tail reward danger.\n\nSo I cannot eat it that way.\n\nI could move away first.\n\nBut to reach (5,1), it takes longer.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), if I move L to (3,4), etc., it might take more turns, and (5,1) might disappear.\n\n(5,1) life 6 at turn 14, so if I don't eat soon, it might be gone.\n\nIn the first option, I eat at turn 17.\n\nIf I go up, I might not reach in time.\n\nFor instance, min turns to (5,1) from (5,4): need to go down, but from (5,4) to (5,1) is 3 steps down, but I have to consider the body.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can only move U, L, R at turn 15.\n\nSay move L to (4,4) as above.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) but dangerous, or L to (3,4), or U to (4,5).\n\nSay move L to (3,4), head at (3,4) dir L.\n\nThen from there, I can move L to (2,4), D to (3,3), U to (3,5).\n\nTo go to (5,1), I need to go down and right.\n\nBut it might take many turns, and by turn 19 or so, food might disappear.\n\nSpecifically, (5,1) disappears after turn 19, so last chance to eat is turn 19.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (5,1), Manhattan distance |3-5| + |4-1| = 2+3=5, so at least 5 moves, but with body, might be more.\n\nTurn 15: at (4,4) after move\n\nTurn 16: move to (3,4)\n\nTurn 17: say move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: move R to (4,3) but (4,3) may have food, or not\n\nTurn 19: to (5,3) or something\n\nNot efficient.\n\nWhereas with first option, I eat at turn 17.\n\nSo moving R at turn 14 seems better to get the food soon.\n\nMoreover, after eating (5,1), I can then go for (4,3).\n\nIn the sequence above, after eating (5,1) at turn 17, head at (5,1), positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nNow (4,3) is free and has food.\n\nI need to move to (4,3).\n\nFrom (5,1), I can move U to (5,2), but (5,2) is body segment, unsafe.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), tail (4,2)\n\nSo adjacent cells: (5,1) can move U to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nL to (4,1), but (4,1) may be free or wall? Walls: border y=0,1? y=1 is free, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 free.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,1), so (4,1) should be free.\n\nx=4,y=1.\n\nAlso R to (6,1) but (6,1) is body.\n\nD to (5,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (5,1): L to (4,1) or U to (5,2) unsafe, or R to (6,1) unsafe.\n\nSo only L to (4,1).\n\nMove L to (4,1).\n\nNew head (4,1), no food, so tail removed: new positions head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)? After move: head (4,1), new1: old head (5,1), new2: old1 (6,1), new3: old2 (6,2), new4: old3 (6,3), new5: old4 (5,3), and old tail (4,2) removed, so tail at (5,3)\n\nHead at (4,1) dir L.\n\nNow from here, I can go to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is two up from (4,1).\n\nBut (4,2) is free? After above, positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo (4,2) is free? Cells: x=4,y=2 is not occupied, and no wall, internal obstacle (3,1), so (4,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) free and has food.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U to (4,2), since (4,2) free.\n\nThen to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut (4,3) has food.\n\nTurn 18: from (4,1), move U to (4,2)\n\nNew head (4,2), no food, so tail removed: new positions head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail at (6,3)? After move: head (4,2), new1: (4,1), new2: (5,1), new3: (6,1), new4: (6,2), new5: (6,3), and old tail (5,3) removed, so tail at (6,3)\n\nHead at (4,2) dir U.\n\nNow (4,3) is north, adjacent.\n\nTurn 19: move U to (4,3)\n\nNow (4,3) has food, value +1, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then previous head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) and since food eaten, tail not removed, so new tail at (6,3), snake length 7.\n\nGrew from 6 to 7 at turn 17, then to 8 at turn 19? Turn 17 ate (5,1), grew to 7, now turn 19 ate (4,3), grow to 8.\n\nBut (4,3) was eaten, and it was free at that time.\n\nLife_span: at turn 19, food (4,3) was still present, since life started 9 at turn 14, at turn 19: life_span at start of turn 19: after decreases, turn 14:9, 15:8, 16:7, 17:6, 18:5, 19:4? Let's compute remaining.\n\nTurn 14: life 9\n\nTurn 15: life 8 (after turn 14 decrease)\n\nTurn 16: life 7\n\nTurn 17: life 6\n\nTurn 18: life 5\n\nTurn 19: life 4, present, so can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this path, I ate both foods by turn 19.\n\nBut in the sequence, I assumed moving R at turn 14.\n\nWhat if I move U at turn 14?\n\nI might not get (5,1) in time.\n\nFor example, if I move U at turn 14 to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 15: say move L to (4,4) which is tail, safe.\n\nHead at (4,4), positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,3) has food, but tail.\n\nIf I move away, say turn 15 move L to (4,4) dir L? After move to (4,4), head dir L.\n\nThen turn 16: from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4), D to (4,3) dangerous, U to (4,5)\n\nSay move L to (3,4)\n\nHead at (3,4) dir L.\n\nThen to go to (5,1), I need to move down.\n\nTurn 17: move D to (3,3)\n\nBut (3,3) may be free.\n\nTurn 18: move R to (4,3) but (4,3) was tail, but now not, and has food.\n\nAfter turn 16: positions when head at (3,4): after turn 15 to (4,4), positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail\n\nTurn 16 move L to (3,4) no food: new head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)? New positions: head (3,4), new1: (4,4), new2: (5,4), new3: (5,3), new4: (5,2), new5: (4,2), and old tail (4,3) removed, so (4,3) freed.\n\nFood at (4,3) still present.\n\nBut I need to go to (5,1).\n\nFrom (3,4), turn 17 move D to (3,3) assuming free.\n\nHead at (3,3) dir D.\n\nTurn 18: move D to (3,2) if possible.\n\n(3,2) should be free.\n\nThen turn 19: move D to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall! Internal obstacle (3,1), so cannot move to (3,1).\n\nSo from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2), but (4,2) might be body.\n\nAt turn 18, positions: after turn 17 move to (3,3), head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) tail? Let's track.\n\nTurn 16: head at (3,4), positions: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nTurn 17: move D to (3,3) no food: new head (3,3), new1: (3,4), new2: (4,4), new3: (5,4), new4: (5,3), new5: (5,2), and tail (4,2) removed, so positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) tail at (5,2)\n\nHead at (3,3) dir D.\n\nTurn 18: move D to (3,2) — (3,2) should be free, no wall.\n\nNew head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail at (5,3)? After move no food: head (3,2), new1: (3,3), new2: (3,4), new3: (4,4), new4: (5,4), new5: (5,3), tail old (5,2) removed.\n\nPositions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\nHead at (3,2) dir D.\n\nNow (5,1) is at (5,1), which is east and down.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move R to (4,2), but (4,2) may be free.\n\n(4,2) is free now.\n\nMove R to (4,2).\n\nTurn 19: move R to (4,2)\n\nNew head (4,2), no food, positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) tail at (5,4)? After move: head (4,2), new1: (3,2), new2: (3,3), new3: (3,4), new4: (4,4), new5: (5,4), and old tail (5,3) removed.\n\nBut (5,1) is at (5,1), and I am at (4,2), not adjacent.\n\nMoreover, (5,1) disappears after turn 19, so at turn 20 not present, so I cannot eat it.\n\nIf I try to move directly, from (4,2) turn 20 move to (5,2) but (5,2) may not be free, or to (4,1) then (5,1), but after turn 19, food gone.\n\nTurn 19 is the last chance to eat (5,1), but at turn 19, if I am at (4,2), I can only move to adjacent, not directly to (5,1), since not adjacent.\n\n(4,2) to (5,1) not adjacent, need two moves.\n\nSo I miss the food.\n\nTherefore, moving U at turn 14 makes it hard to get (5,1) in time, whereas moving R allows me to eat both.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in the sequence with R move, when I ate (5,1), head was at (6,1), moved to (5,1), which was free, not tail, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3), I ate it when it was free, not tail.\n\nIn the U move path, I might have risk at (4,3) if not careful.\n\nBut in R path, it seems safe.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1=14.\n\nThe problem says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and answer with actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nIn the format: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but since I have a plan for several turns, I can list until I eat both or something.\n\nBut perhaps I should list the actions I decided.\n\nSince after eating both, I can continue, but the state might change, so maybe list for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in my plan, by turn 19 I have eaten both.\n\nTurn 14 to 19 is 6 turns.\n\nI could list actions from turn 14 to, say, turn 18 or 19.\n\nBut let's see the current turn is 14, and I need to specify actions starting from turn 14.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 14: move R\n\nThen turn 15: move D\n\nTurn 16: move D\n\nTurn 17: move L to eat (5,1)\n\nThen turn 18: move L to (4,1)? In the earlier, after turn 17, I was at (5,1), then I moved L to (4,1) because I couldn't move U.\n\nIn turn 17, after eating (5,1), head at (5,1) dir L.\n\nThen turn 18: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 19: move U to (4,2)\n\nThen move U to (4,3) at turn 20? Turn 19: move U to (4,2), then turn 20 move U to (4,3)\n\nBut turn 20 is beyond.\n\nIn turn 19 I moved to (4,2), and food at (4,3) can be eaten turn 20.\n\nBut life_span: at turn 20, if life_span decreases, for (4,3) at turn 19: life was 4? Start turn 19: life 4, after turn 19 decrease to 3 for turn 20, so present at turn 20.\n\nCan eat at turn 20.\n\nBut I need to output actions from turn 14 onwards.\n\nPerhaps I can list up to turn 18 or so.\n\nSince the thinking is for the current decision, but I need to specify multiple actions.\n\nAnother thing: in the move to (6,3) at turn 14, is there any risk?\n\n(6,3) is at x=6, which is adjacent to wall x=7, but no issue.\n\nThen moving down to (6,2), (6,1), all fine.\n\nThen to (5,1).\n\nBut when I move to (6,1) at turn 16, then to (5,1) at turn 17.\n\nNow, after that, I go to (4,1) and up.\n\nBut at (4,1), there is internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is wall, but (4,1) is free.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating (4,3) if not necessary, but it's positive food, so I should eat it.\n\nBut in the long term, eating both is good.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions:\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 16: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 17: move L to (5,1) and eat food\n\nThen, as above, turn 18: from (5,1) dir L, move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 19: from (4,1) dir L, but after moving to (4,1), new dir is L, so from (4,1), I can move L to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, invalid; or U to (4,2); or D to (4,0) invalid.\n\nSo only U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 20: from (4,2) dir U, move U to (4,3) and eat.\n\nBut I need to output from turn 14.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from 14.\n\nI think listing up to turn 17 or 18 is fine, but since the food at (4,3) has time, I can stop after eating the first one or something.\n\nBut to be complete, I'll list until turn 18, for example.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and current turn 14, so think to turn 19 or beyond.\n\nIn my plan, actions are clear.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (4,3) at turn 20, but turn 20 is not in the 5+ from 14? 14 to 19 is 5 turns ahead? Turn 14, think to turn 19, which is 5 steps.\n\nTurn 14 to 15 is one turn, etc.\n\nPerhaps list actions for turns 14 to 18, which is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 14,15,16,17,18.\n\nIn turn 18, I move to (4,1), then turn 19 to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut at turn 18, I am at (4,1), heading to (4,3).\n\nSince the state will change, I can output the actions for the immediate turns.\n\nBut the format is to list multiple actions.\n\nI think for this, moving R at turn 14 is best.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason to move U.\n\nFor example, if I move U, I might go for (4,3) first.\n\nBut (4,3) has more time, and (5,1) has less, so better to get (5,1) first.\n\nAlso, by moving R, I free (4,3) earlier, as in the sequence.\n\nIn U move, (4,3) is freed later.\n\nIn the R move sequence, at turn 16, (4,3) is freed when tail moves.\n\nIn U move, later.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nSo I think R is better.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: R (right)\n\nTurn 15: D (down)\n\nTurn 16: D (down)\n\nTurn 17: L (left) to eat food at (5,1)\n\nThen for turn 18, from there, move L to (4,1), as above.\n\nBut since I need to specify, and thinking ahead, I can include.\n\nPerhaps the answer should include actions until the food is eaten or something.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll list for turns 14 to 18.\n\nTurn 18: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 19: U to (4,2), but that might be extra.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\" and \"long-term survival\", after eating, I can explore, but for now, this plan is good.\n\nNow, about the direction: after each move, the head direction changes.\n\nIn the actions, I need to output the move, not the direction.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, when I move to (5,1) at turn 17, I eat, then turn 18 move L to (4,1).\n\nIs there a better way? From (5,1) after eating, I have to move L, since other moves unsafe.\n\nThen to (4,1), then U to (4,2), then U to (4,3).\n\nI could from (5,1) after eating, but I have to move L first.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide the actions.\n\nNow, the food at (4,3) is not eaten until turn 20, but since the actions are sequential, I can list up to turn 18.\n\nPerhaps the AI should output only the necessary actions, but I think for this, I'll go with the plan.\n\nAnother point: in turn 14, if I move R, I go to (6,3), which is near the wall, but no immediate danger.\n\nI could consider moving U, but as before, risky for (5,1).\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,3) first if possible, but it's occupied.\n\nTo free (4,3), I need the snake to move such that the segment at (4,3) moves.\n\nCurrently, it is segment 3.\n\nDepending on movement.\n\nFor example, if I move U at turn 14 to (5,4), then positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nThe segment at (4,3) is still there.\n\nIf I then move, say, R to (6,4) at turn 15, then positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail at (4,3)? After move no food: head (6,4), new1: (5,4), new2: (5,3), new3: (5,2), new4: (4,2), new5: (4,3), tail old (4,4) removed.\n\nSo (4,3) is still occupied.\n\nThen later, when tail moves, it frees.\n\nBut slower.\n\nNot efficient for (5,1).\n\nSo I think initial plan is best.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: L (to eat (5,1))\n\nFor turn 18: from (5,1) dir L, move L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 19: U to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut since the output might not need all, I can stop at turn 17 or include up to 18.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify multiple.\n\nI'll list for turns 14 to 18.\n\nIn turn 18, moving to (4,1) is part of going to (4,3).\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from 14 to 18 is 4 actions? Turns: 14,15,16,17,18 — that's 5 turns: turn 14, then 15,16,17,18.\n\nTurn 14 is the current, action for turn 14.\n\nThen turn 15, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the sequence, turn 18 action is L to (4,1).\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 14, the goal is to maximize the score by eating the positive food at (5,1) and (4,3) while avoiding collisions and considering long-term survival. The food at (5,1) has a limited life span of 6 turns (disappearing after turn 19), so it must be prioritized. The food at (4,3) has a longer life span of 9 turns (disappearing after turn 22) and is currently under the snake's body, so it can only be eaten after the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nAfter evaluating possible moves 5+ turns ahead, the optimal sequence is to:\n- Move right (R) to (6,3) on turn 14, avoiding the body segment at (4,3) and starting the path toward (5,1).\n- Move down (D) to (6,2) on turn 15, continuing toward (5,1).\n- Move down (D) to (6,1) on turn 16, positioning to eat (5,1) on the next turn.\n- Move left (L) to (5,1) on turn 17, eating the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 7).\n- Move left (L) to (4,1) on turn 18, beginning the path to free and eat (4,3) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,1).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats (5,1) before it disappears and sets up a safe path to eat (4,3) in subsequent turns. Moving up (U) on turn 14 risks missing (5,1) due to distance and the no-instant-reverse constraint, and moving left (L) is unsafe due to body collision. After turn 18, the snake can continue to (4,2) and (4,3) to eat the remaining food, with (4,3) freed by turn 16 and still available until turn 22.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 15: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 16: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 17: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 18: L (left)\n}",

        "step": 15,
        "score": 5,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 15. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), except for the obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,3), then body segments at (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (6,3) from previous position.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,1) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- (4,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so they're positive food.\n\nLife span: for (5,1), it disappears after 5 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 15, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 19 (since countdown decreases each turn, starting from turn 15: after 15,16,17,18,19 it's gone). Similarly, (4,3) has life span 8, so it disappears after turn 22.\n\nNow, snake head is at (6,3), moving right. Possible moves from here: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is R, so I can't move L (left) next.\n\nAvailable moves: Up, Down, Right. Left is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nNow, coordinates: let's list the grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nObstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake body: (6,3) head, (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nSo let's plot this:\n\ny=6: ... not specified, but walls at y=7 and y=0.\n\ny=5: not occupied by snake? Snake has (4,4), which is y=4.\n\nList positions:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 4: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,4)  // tail\n\nSo the snake is coiled around (4,3) to (5,3) to (5,2), etc.\n\nFood at (5,1) and (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is a food position, but (4,3) is also occupied by a snake body segment. Specifically, (4,3) is the fourth segment in the list, index 3? Positions: index 0: head (6,3), index 1: (5,3), index 2: (5,2), index 3: (4,2), index 4: (4,3), index 5: (4,4). So (4,3) is segment 4.\n\nFood at (4,3) is under the snake's body. But according to rules, it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,1) is free.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, possible actions for turn 15: since head is at (6,3), direction R.\n\nCan move: Up (U) to (6,4), Down (D) to (6,2), Right (R) to (7,3).\n\nBut x=7 is wall, so moving right to (7,3) is invalid, wall collision.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, but (6,2) y=2, which is between 1 and 6, so should be ok, but let's check walls.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (7,3) has x=7, wall. (6,2) has x=6, y=2, not border, so ok. Similarly, (6,4) ok.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant for (6,2) or (6,4).\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4)\n\n- D to (6,2)\n\n- R to (7,3) but wall, invalid\n\n- L to (5,3) but L is opposite to current direction R, so instant reverse not allowed. Therefore, only U and D are possible.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to (6,3). So next move, I can go U, D, or R, but R is wall, so only U or D.\n\nSo for turn 15, actions: U or D.\n\nNow, let's see what happens with each.\n\nFirst, if I go Up to (6,4): is (6,4) occupied? Snake positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (6,4) is not in the list, so empty. Also not wall, so safe.\n\nThen new head position (6,4), and the tail will move, so the new positions would be: head to (6,4), then body: previous head (6,3) becomes segment 1, then (5,3) segment 2, (5,2) segment 3, (4,2) segment 4, (4,3) segment 5, and tail (4,4) is removed if no food eaten, but since no food at (6,4), length unchanged, tail removed.\n\nFood positions: (5,1) and (4,3), neither is (6,4), so no food eaten. So snake moves to: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)] and (4,4) is gone, so positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). Tail is now (4,3)? (4,3) was segment 4, now it's segment 5, and (4,4) removed, so tail is (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) has food under it? Food at (4,3) is still there, but under body.\n\nNow, head direction would be U.\n\nIf I go Down to (6,2): (6,2) is empty? Snake positions don't have (6,2), walls not, so ok. Then new head (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) removed. So positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n\nAgain, no food at (6,2), so length same.\n\nNow, food at (5,1) and (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is currently occupied by snake body, and food is there. To eat it, the body must move away and head move to it.\n\nCurrently, (4,3) is the tail in the new positions if I move U or D? After move, tail is (4,3) in both cases.\n\nIn current state, before move, (4,3) is a body segment, not head.\n\nAfter any move, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away from (4,4) to the next, but (4,3) might stay or move.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nIf I move U to (6,4), new positions: head (6,4), then segments: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). So (4,3) is now the last segment, tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (6,2), new positions: head (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). Tail at (4,3).\n\nIn both cases, after turn 15 move, (4,3) is the tail position.\n\nFood is at (4,3), so it is under the tail now.\n\nBut to eat it, the head must move to (4,3) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, after move, (4,3) has tail, so not free.\n\nFood life span: (4,3) has life span 8, so from turn 15, it will disappear after 8 turns, so on turn 23 it's gone? Countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, meaning after N steps.\n\nFor food at turn t with life span L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor (4,3): turn 15, life span 8, so present on turns 15 to 22, disappear on turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1): life span 5, present on turns 15 to 19, disappear on turn 20.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, after turn 15 move, tail is at (4,3) in both U and D cases.\n\nLet's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (6,4) on turn 15.\n\nThen positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nHead direction: Up\n\nFood at (5,1) and (4,3) — (4,3) is under tail.\n\nNow, for turn 16, from (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) but wall, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (down), opposite.\n\nSo can move U, L, R. But R to (7,4) wall, so only U or L.\n\nU to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\n(6,5) and (5,4) should be free? Let's see current positions: after turn 15, positions are (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(6,5) not occupied, (5,4) not occupied.\n\nAlso, no walls.\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), new head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) and tail (4,3) removed if no food, but (4,3) has food, but not eaten since head not on it.\n\nNo food at (6,5), so tail removed, positions: head (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\n(4,3) is gone? When snake moves, if no food eaten, tail is removed. So from previous, positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) — when head moves to (6,5), the new positions: head to (6,5), then the first body segment is previous head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) — and (4,3) is removed because no growth. So tail is (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,3) is still there, under where the tail was, but now the cell is empty? When tail moves away, the cell becomes empty, so food at (4,3) can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (6,5), (4,3) is empty with food.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved L to (5,4) on turn 16.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to turn 15 choice.\n\nOption 2: Move Down to (6,2) on turn 15.\n\nThen positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nHead direction: Down\n\nFood at (5,1) and (4,3) under tail.\n\nFor turn 16, from (6,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,1), U to (6,3) but U is opposite to D, so cannot move U.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U (up), opposite.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied by body? Current positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(5,2) is a body segment, so moving to (5,2) would be collision.\n\nD to (6,1): y=1, not wall, but internal obstacle? Walls: border y=0 is wall, y=1 is not border, but internal obstacle at (3,1), not (6,1), so (6,1) should be free.\n\n(6,1) not in snake positions, so ok.\n\nL to (5,2): but (5,2) is occupied by segment, so collision, invalid.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,1).\n\nThen new head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) and tail (4,3) removed, so positions: head (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nFood at (4,3) now free.\n\nAlso, food at (5,1) is at (5,1), which is adjacent.\n\nNow, comparing the two options for turn 15.\n\nIf I go Up to (6,4), I can then go to (6,5) or (5,4) on turn 16.\n\nIf I go Down to (6,2), I must go to (6,1) on turn 16.\n\nNow, food at (5,1) has short life, only until turn 19, so 5 turns including turn 15? Life span 5 from turn 15, so present turns 15,16,17,18,19, gone turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) life span 8, turns 15-22.\n\nI need to plan to eat food.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the down move.\n\nIf on turn 15, I move D to (6,2), then turn 16 move D to (6,1).\n\nNow at (6,1), head direction D.\n\nFood at (5,1) is adjacent, at (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,1), possible moves: D to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,2) but U is opposite to current D, so cannot.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (6,0) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (7,1) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) — (5,1) is food position, not occupied by snake now? After turn 16, positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) so (5,1) is free.\n\nAnd food there.\n\nSo I can move L to (5,1) on turn 17.\n\nIf I do that, eat the food at (5,1), value +1, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head to (5,1), then body: previous head (6,1) becomes segment, and tail not removed, so new length 7.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) — and (4,3) was tail but removed? No, since food eaten, tail not removed, so the body is from head to tail: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) — but (4,3) is not part of snake anymore? Before eating, positions were (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) with tail (4,2)? After turn 16 move to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), then segments (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) — tail (4,2).\n\nThen when move to (5,1) and eat food, new head (5,1), then body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) — so tail still (4,2), no, since growth, the tail stays, so positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) — 7 segments, tail at (4,2).\n\n(4,3) is free with food.\n\nNow, head at (5,1), direction from (6,1) to (5,1) is left, so head direction L.\n\nBut is there any danger? (5,1) is not wall, not body collision.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), but (5,1) is ok.\n\nAfter eating, food at (5,1) is consumed, so gone.\n\nFood at (4,3) still there.\n\nNow, from (5,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (4,1), U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (right), opposite.\n\nCan move L, U, D.\n\nD to (5,0) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (5,2) — but (5,2) is a body segment, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (4,1) — (4,1) should be free? Current positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) so (4,1) not occupied, not wall? Walls: x=0,y=0 etc, (4,1) x=4,y=1, not border, internal obstacle at (3,1), not (4,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (4,1).\n\nThen new head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) and tail (4,2) removed? No food, so tail removed, positions: head (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail at (5,2)\n\n(4,2) removed.\n\nFood at (4,3) is at (4,3), which is adjacent to head at (4,1)? (4,1) to (4,3) is not adjacent, need to move.\n\nFrom (4,1), head direction L (since from (5,1) to (4,1) left).\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,1), but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nU to (4,2) — but (4,2) is not occupied now? After move, positions have (5,2) but not (4,2), so (4,2) free? Positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) so (4,2) is empty.\n\nU to (4,2) is possible.\n\nD to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, and R is opposite to L? Current direction L, so cannot move R, opposite.\n\nCan move U or D or L, but L to (3,1) wall, D to (4,0) wall, so only U to (4,2).\n\nThen move to (4,2), no food, so new positions: head (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\n(5,2) removed.\n\nFood at (4,3) is at (4,3), adjacent to (4,2).\n\nNow, head at (4,2), direction U (since from (4,1) to (4,2) up).\n\nThen I can move to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nMove U to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) has food, so eat it.\n\nBut tail reward danger: is head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,3), which is adjacent to (4,3)? (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent, right?\n\nPositions: head (4,2), tail (5,3). (4,2) to (5,3) not adjacent; adjacent means sharing edge, so (4,2) adjacent to (4,3), (4,1), (5,2), (3,2) etc.\n\n(4,2) and (5,3) are diagonal, not adjacent, so not directly connected.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), head at (4,3), which was food, so eat, grow.\n\nBut tail is at (5,3), which is adjacent to (4,3)? (4,3) and (5,3) share an edge, so yes, adjacent.\n\nSo if I eat food at (4,3) with head at (4,2) moving to (4,3), and tail at (5,3), which is adjacent.\n\nThen after eating, new head at (4,3), body grows, so new tail will be where the old tail was, but since it grows, the segment that was tail stays, and new segment added.\n\nSpecifically: before move, positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3)\n\nAfter move to (4,3), eat food, so new head (4,3), then body: previous head (4,2) becomes segment, then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and since food eaten, tail not removed, so (5,3) remains, and new segment? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head to (4,3), then the body includes all previous positions without removing tail, so new positions: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — 8 segments.\n\nTail is (5,3), and head is at (4,3), which are adjacent.\n\nNow, the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, when I eat the food at (4,3), the tail cell is (5,3), which does not have food; the food is at (4,3), which is where head is moving to.\n\nThe rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n\nHere, tail cell is (5,3), which has no food; food is at head cell (4,3).\n\nSo this should be fine; no danger.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), adjacent, but no food on tail cell, so ok.\n\nThen the snake is longer.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ate both foods: (5,1) on turn 17 and (4,3) on turn 19 or something.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 16: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 17: move L to (5,1) eat food\n\nThen turn 18: move L to (4,1)  // from (5,1) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 19: move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 20: move U to (4,3) eat food\n\nYes.\n\nBut food at (5,1) disappeared after turn 19? Present turns 15-19, so on turn 17, it is present, eaten.\n\n(4,3) present until turn 22, eaten on turn 20.\n\nNow, but on turn 20, after eating (4,3), snake is at (4,3) head, with body around.\n\nBut is there risk? For example, after turn 19, head at (4,2), tail at (5,3), and (4,3) has food, so moving to it is safe.\n\nBut let's see if I can do better.\n\nNow, back to turn 15, if I move up instead.\n\nIf on turn 15, move U to (6,4)\n\nThen positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 16: from (6,4), direction U, can move U or L (since R wall).\n\nU to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf move U to (6,5), then positions: head (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail (4,2) — (4,3) removed, so food at (4,3) free.\n\nThen from (6,5), direction U, can move U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall.\n\nD is opposite to U? Current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nR wall, so U to (6,6) or L to (5,5)\n\n(6,6) is y=6, not wall? y=7 wall, so y=6 is ok.\n\nBut if I go to (6,6), then I'm near border.\n\nSimilarly, L to (5,5).\n\nBut I need to get to food.\n\nFood at (5,1) and (4,3).\n\n(5,1) is far, and life span short.\n\nFrom (6,5), I might go down or left.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (4,3) first.\n\nAfter turn 16, if I moved to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\nFood at (4,3) free.\n\nBut head at (6,5), far from (4,3).\n\nI need to move towards it.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,5) on turn 17.\n\nThen from (6,5) to (5,5), direction L.\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail (4,2) removed? No food, so positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail (5,2)\n\n(4,2) removed.\n\nFood at (4,3) still there.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction L, can move L to (4,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5) but body.\n\nR to (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nU to (5,6) y=6, ok.\n\nD to (5,4) free.\n\nL to (4,5) free.\n\nI can go down to (5,4), then to (5,3), but (5,3) is body? Positions have (5,3), so occupied.\n\nTo reach (4,3), from (5,5), I can go to (4,5) or (5,4), but (5,4) is free? Positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) so (5,4) not occupied, free.\n\nMove to (5,4) on turn 18.\n\nThen head (5,4), direction from (5,5) to (5,4) down, so D.\n\nThen from (5,4), can move D to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nMove L to (4,4)? (4,4) free? Not in positions, so free.\n\nThen to (4,4), then to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) has food.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail (5,2)\n\nThen move L to (4,4) on turn 19, no food, so positions: head (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3)\n\n(5,2) removed.\n\nThen from (4,4), head direction L, can move L to (3,4)? But internal obstacle at (3,1), not (3,4), so (3,4) free? Walls: internal only (3,1), so (3,4) ok.\n\nU to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4) body.\n\nR is opposite to L? Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nCan move L, U, D.\n\nD to (4,3) — (4,3) has food, and it's free.\n\nSo move D to (4,3) eat food on turn 20.\n\nBut food at (5,1) disappeared on turn 20? Present until turn 19, so on turn 20, it's gone, not eaten.\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat (5,1), only (4,3) on turn 20.\n\nBut (5,1) was available but I didn't go for it.\n\nIf on turn 16 I had moved L instead of U.\n\nAfter turn 15 move U to (6,4), on turn 16 I could move L to (5,4).\n\nThen from (6,4) to (5,4), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail (4,3) removed? No food, so positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\n(4,3) free with food.\n\nNow from (5,4), direction L, can move L to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4) body.\n\nD to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (5,5) free.\n\nL to (4,4) free.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), then head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail (4,2) removed? Positions: head (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail (5,2)\n\n(4,2) removed.\n\nThen from (4,4), direction L, can move L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3).\n\nD to (4,3) has food, so I can eat it on turn 18? Timeline:\n\nTurn 15: U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 16: L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 17: L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18: D to (4,3) eat food\n\nThen ate (4,3) on turn 18.\n\nBut (5,1) not eaten, disappears turn 20.\n\nIn the first path (moving down), I ate both foods.\n\nIn the up path, I might not eat (5,1).\n\nMoreover, in the down path, I have a risk when moving to (4,3) but we saw it was fine.\n\nBut in the down path, on turn 17, when I move to (5,1), is there any issue?\n\n(5,1) is near the obstacle at (3,1), but not directly.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,1), so when I go to (4,1), it's adjacent to (3,1), but as long as I don't move there.\n\nIn turn 18, I moved to (4,1), then to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut moving down first allows me to get (5,1) quickly.\n\nIf I move up, I might not get (5,1) in time.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) or (5,4), to get to (5,1), I need to go down, but the snake body is below.\n\nFor instance, after moving to (5,4) on turn 16, positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nTo go to (5,1), I need to go down, but (5,3) and (5,2) are occupied.\n\nIf I move D from (5,4) to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, collision.\n\nMove to (4,4) or something, but (5,1) is at y=1.\n\nIt might take more turns and I might not reach before turn 20.\n\nFor example, shortest path: from (5,4) to (5,1) is down, but blocked.\n\nI need to go around, say to (4,4), then (4,3) but (4,3) has food, or to (4,2), etc., but it might take 4 or more turns, and (5,1) gone by turn 20.\n\nTurn 16 at (5,4), to (5,1): if I go to (5,3) but occupied, so I need to go left or down but down not possible from (5,4) directly.\n\nMove to (4,4) on turn 17, then from (4,4) to (4,3) on turn 18, but (4,3) might be eaten, or to (4,2) on turn 18, then to (5,2) but (5,2) occupied? On turn 18, positions depend.\n\nIt's messy and I might not reach (5,1) in time.\n\nWhereas in the down path, I can eat it on turn 17.\n\nSo moving down on turn 15 seems better to get the short-life food.\n\nMoreover, after eating both, I have a longer snake and can explore.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nIn the down path, after eating (4,3) on turn 20, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), adjacent, but no food, so ok.\n\nThen I can move to other areas.\n\nBut the grid is small, 6x6 playable, with obstacle.\n\nBut since I ate both foods, snake length 8 now? Initially 6, ate two +1, so 8.\n\nIn down path: start length 6, ate (5,1) on turn 17, length 7, then ate (4,3) on turn 20, length 8.\n\nNow, with moving up, I might eat only one food, length 7.\n\nBut survival: in the down path, when I go to (6,1) and (5,1), I'm near the bottom, but not trapped.\n\nFor example, after eating at (5,1), I went to (4,1), which is near the obstacle.\n\n(4,1) is adjacent to (3,1) obstacle, so I can only go up to (4,2), which I did.\n\nThen to (4,3).\n\nAfter that, head at (4,3), I can go to (3,3), (4,4), (5,3) but (5,3) is body, or (4,2) but might be body.\n\nPositions after eating (4,3) on turn 20: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3)? Earlier: after move to (4,3), positions (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nYes, tail at (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), head direction U (since from (4,2) to (4,3) up).\n\nCan move U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but body, collision, L to (3,3), R to (5,3) but body, collision.\n\nD to (4,2) is body segment, occupied.\n\nR to (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nL to (3,3) should be free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nU to (4,4) free? Positions have (4,4)? No, not in list, so free.\n\nSo can move U to (4,4) or L to (3,3).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nIn the up path, if I move up, I might not eat (5,1), and have a shorter snake, but avoid the bottom area, which might be safer? But the bottom area is ok as long as I don't hit walls.\n\nBut with internal obstacle, but I managed.\n\nMoreover, moving down allows me to eat both foods, maximizing score.\n\nNow, another thing: in the down path, when I move to (6,1) on turn 16, (6,1) is at y=1, near border, but not wall.\n\nThen to (5,1), which is also y=1.\n\nThen to (4,1), which is near (3,1) obstacle.\n\nBut I moved up to (4,2), so I avoided issue.\n\nCould I have moved differently after (5,1)?\n\nAfter (5,1), I had to move to (4,1) because U to (5,2) was body, D invalid.\n\nSo only choice.\n\nBut it worked.\n\nNow, back to turn 15, I think moving down is better to get the food.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 16: move D to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 17: move L to (5,1) eat food\n\nThen turn 18: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 19: move U to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 20: move U to (4,3) eat food\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, but how many? The output should start from turn 15 action, and then a few more, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nLooking at answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide actions for at least 5 turns? From turn 15 to, say, turn 19 or 20.\n\nIn this case, with moving down, I have a sequence.\n\nIf I move up on turn 15, I might not have a clear path to the food.\n\nAnother option: when I move down, on turn 16 to (6,1), I could choose not to eat (5,1) immediately, but why? It's the only food with short life.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), I could only move L to (5,1), since other moves invalid, so I have to eat it on turn 17 if I move down.\n\nIf I had moved up on turn 15, I might not reach it.\n\nSo moving down seems necessary to get (5,1).\n\nMoreover, after that, I can get (4,3) later.\n\nNow, about the food at (4,3): in the sequence above, I eat it on turn 20, but it has life until turn 22, so fine.\n\nIn the up path, I could eat it earlier, but miss (5,1).\n\nSince both have value 1, eating both is better.\n\nNow, in the down path, is there any risk of collision when moving?\n\nFor example, on turn 19, moving to (4,2), is it safe?\n\nAfter turn 18, positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail (5,2)? Timeline:\n\nTurn 17: after eating at (5,1), positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) // earlier I had (4,2) but let's correct.\n\nAfter turn 17: moved to (5,1) eat, so positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\nThen turn 18: move L to (4,1), no food, so new positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail (5,2) — (4,2) removed.\n\nThen turn 19: move U to (4,2), no food, positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3)\n\nThen turn 20: move U to (4,3), eat food, positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3)\n\nAll safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nAfter that, from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) or L to (3,3), etc.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nThe state is at turn 15, so I should output from turn 15 onwards.\n\nHow many turns? Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", perhaps output 5 actions: turn 15 to 19 or 15 to 20.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20 is eating the second food.\n\nPerhaps I can output until turn 20.\n\nBut let's see if moving down is the only choice.\n\nWhat if on turn 15 I move up? Then I might not eat (5,1), so worse score.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly for (4,3), but (5,1) will disappear.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (6,2), but instead of going down again, but on turn 16 I have to go to (6,1) since only choice.\n\nAfter (6,2), only D to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), only L to (5,1).\n\nSo I have to eat it.\n\nIf I had moved up on turn 15, I could go to (6,4), then to (5,4), then down to (5,3)? But (5,3) occupied.\n\nCannot.\n\nMove to (5,4) then to (4,4), then to (4,3), but as before, and (5,1) not reached.\n\nSo moving down is better.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the tail position.\n\nIn initial state, food at (4,3) under body.\n\nAfter moving down on turn 15, tail is at (4,3), so food under tail.\n\nThen when I move, tail moves away, food free.\n\nBut in the sequence, I eat it later.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think the plan is solid.\n\nTherefore, for turn 15, move Down.\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nTurn 15: D (down)\n\nTurn 16: D (down) to (6,1)\n\nTurn 17: L (left) to (5,1) eat\n\nTurn 18: L (left) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 19: U (up) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 20: U (up) to (4,3) eat\n\nBut the output should start from turn 15, and I have up to turn 20.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, 6 actions are fine.\n\nI could stop at turn 19, but turn 20 is the key for second food.\n\nThe food at (4,3) can be eaten later, but in this path, I do it on turn 20.\n\nTo minimize output, but I think it's ok.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 19, after moving to (4,2), I could move to other places, but (4,3) is there, so I should eat it.\n\nIf I don't, I might miss it, but life span long.\n\nBut since it's positive, I should eat when possible.\n\nIn this case, moving up to eat is fine.\n\nSo sequence is good.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the strategy involves eating both positive food items while avoiding collisions. The food at (5,1) has a short life span (disappears after turn 19), so it must be eaten by turn 19. The food at (4,3) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 22) and is currently under the snake's body, so it can only be eaten after the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nAfter analyzing the grid and snake positions, moving down on turn 15 allows the snake to reach (5,1) quickly. From there, the snake can navigate to eat (4,3) safely. The sequence below ensures both foods are eaten by turn 20, with no collisions or risks, and the snake grows to length 8.\n\n- **Turn 15**: Move down (D) to (6,2) – Avoids walls and reverses; positions head at (6,2) with direction down.\n- **Turn 16**: Move down (D) to (6,1) – Only valid move; positions head at (6,1) with direction down.\n- **Turn 17**: Move left (L) to (5,1) – Eats positive food (+1); snake grows to length 7; positions head at (5,1) with direction left.\n- **Turn 18**: Move left (L) to (4,1) – Only valid move (up and down invalid due to walls/body); positions head at (4,1) with direction left.\n- **Turn 19**: Move up (U) to (4,2) – Only valid move (left to (3,1) is wall, right invalid); positions head at (4,2) with direction up.\n- **Turn 20**: Move up (U) to (4,3) – Eats positive food (+1); snake grows to length 8; positions head at (4,3) with direction up.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods, avoids the tail reward danger (head and tail not adjacent during eating), and positions the snake for further movement. Beyond turn 20, the snake can explore safely, e.g., moving to (4,4) or (3,3).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: D\nTurn 17: L\nTurn 18: L\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 16. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, I should consider the grid as 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and an obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, the current direction is towards decreasing y, I think? Let me confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically, in such grids, y=0 might be the top or bottom. But since head direction is D (down), and the head is at (6,2) with previous position at (6,3)? Snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), ...]. Head is at (6,2), and the next segment is at (6,3). Since head direction is D (down), that means moving down should decrease y if y=0 is top, or increase y if y=0 is bottom. I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nLooking at the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). Also, walls include y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is probably the bottom or top? Let's see the food positions to infer.\n\nFood at (5,1), (4,3), (4,4). Snake has a segment at (4,3), which is also a food location. But food can be under the body, as per rules.\n\nHead direction is D, down. Since D is (x,y-1), that means decreasing y. So if head is at (6,2) and moving down to (6,1), y decreases, so y=0 is the bottom? Typically in computer graphics, y=0 is top, but here D is (x,y-1), which might imply y increases downward or upward. Let's think carefully.\n\nU is (x,y+1) — up increases y, so y increases upward? That might be unusual. Standard is often y=0 top, y increasing downward. But here U is (x,y+1), so if y+1, it might be y increasing downward.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (0,0) is a corner.\n\nSince D is (x,y-1), moving down decreases y, so y=0 is the top, and y=7 is the bottom? If y decreases when moving down, then y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom. For example, from (6,2) down to (6,1), y decreases from 2 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, U is (x,y+1), moving up increases y, so from lower y to higher y, meaning upward if y=0 is top.\n\nBut in standard grid, if y=0 is top, moving up should decrease y, but here U is y+1, so y increases when moving up, which means y=0 must be bottom.\n\nI think I have a inconsistency in my thinking.\n\nLet me read the movement definitions:\n\n- U: (x,y+1) — so moving up, y increases by 1.\n\n- D: (x,y-1) — moving down, y decreases by 1.\n\n- L: (x-1,y) — left, x decreases by 1.\n\n- R: (x+1,y) — right, x increases by 1.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nIf moving up increases y (U: y+1), that means higher y values are up, so y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top? That might be it.\n\nFor example, at (x,y), U to (x,y+1) is upward, so y+1 is higher row number.\n\nSimilarly, D to (x,y-1) is downward, y-1 is lower row number.\n\nSo in this system, y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. That makes sense because if y=0 is bottom, moving up increases y to y=1, etc., toward y=7 top.\n\nBut typically in games, y=0 is top, but here the definition suggests otherwise. I should go with the given.\n\nIn the snake positions: head at (6,2), with direction D, so it came from (6,3) because positions are head first, so from (6,3) to (6,2), which is decreasing y, so D is downward, y decreasing.\n\nAnd (6,3) to (6,2) is y from 3 to 2, decrease, so if y decreases downward, y=0 is bottom? Let's list positions:\n\nSnake: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nSo head at (6,2), next at (6,3), so the snake was at (6,3) previous turn, moved to (6,2) with direction D, down, so from higher y to lower y? (6,3) to (6,2), y from 3 to 2, decreased, so moving down decreased y.\n\nTherefore, lower y values are downward, so y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top. That means the grid has (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right, for example.\n\nIn standard coordinates, if we think of (0,0) as bottom-left, then x right, y up.\n\nBut here, U is (x,y+1), which increases y, so if y=0 bottom, y+1 is up, correct.\n\nD is (x,y-1), decreases y, down toward bottom.\n\nL and R as usual.\n\nWalls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll foods are positive, value 1.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,2), direction D (down).\n\nCurrent possible moves: since head direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U, because no instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction, so opposite of D is U, so cannot move U. Can move L, R, or D.\n\nNow, adjacent cells to head (6,2):\n\n- Up (U): (6,2+1) = (6,3)\n\n- Down (D): (6,2-1) = (6,1)\n\n- Left (L): (6-1,2) = (5,2)\n\n- Right (R): (6+1,2) = (7,2)\n\nBut walls: x=7 is wall, so (7,2) is invalid, collision.\n\ny=0 is wall, but (6,1) is y=1, not wall, y=1 is above y=0, so (6,1) should be ok, not wall.\n\nGrid: y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so (6,1) is y=1, which is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are safe, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant here.\n\nSo for (6,2):\n\n- U: (6,3) — but is this safe? (6,3) is occupied by the snake body, second segment.\n\nSnake positions: (6,2) head, (6,3) body, (5,3), etc.\n\nSo (6,3) is a body segment, so moving U to (6,3) would cause collision with body.\n\n- D: (6,1) — let's check if wall or body. y=1, not wall. Snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). None at (6,1), so empty? But food might be there, but (6,1) not listed, so empty cell.\n\n- L: (5,2) — (5,2) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (5,2) is the fourth segment, index 3? List: index 0: (6,2) head, index 1: (6,3), index 2: (5,3), index 3: (5,2), index 4: (4,2), index 5: (4,3). So (5,2) is a body segment, so moving L to (5,2) would be collision.\n\n- R: (7,2) — x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is D to (6,1), since U, L, R are all invalid or cause collision.\n\nU to (6,3) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,2) is body, collision.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, collision.\n\nD to (6,1) seems empty.\n\nBut is (6,1) within bounds? x=6 between 0-7, y=1 between 0-7, not wall, and no body, so should be safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7. (6,1) has x=6, y=1, both not wall, and not obstacle, and no snake body, so yes, only D is possible?\n\nBut that can't be right for thinking ahead; I need to consider future moves.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nFood at (5,1), which is near, but not at (6,1).\n\n(5,1) is a food position.\n\nBut for now, at turn 16, from (6,2), only D to (6,1) seems possible.\n\nBut let's list all cells.\n\nGrid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, all y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake occupies: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nFood at: (5,1), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,3) is both food and snake body segment? Positions: (4,3) is the tail? Index 5: (4,3), which is the last segment.\n\nAnd food at (4,3) with life span 7, value 1.\n\nAs per rules, food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is food, empty.\n\n(5,1) is food, empty.\n\nNow back to head at (6,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (6,3) - occupied by snake body, collision, invalid\n\n- D: (6,1) - empty, no wall, valid\n\n- L: (5,2) - occupied by snake body (index 3), collision, invalid\n\n- R: (7,2) - x=7, wall, invalid\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is D to (6,1).\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead. If I move to (6,1), what next?\n\nAlso, at (6,1), is there food? Food is at (5,1), not (6,1), so no food eaten.\n\nNow, after moving to (6,1), the snake will be at [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)] and tail was (4,3) which moves away? Let's simulate.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food at (6,1), so tail is removed. Tail was (4,3), so snake becomes: head at (6,1), then previous head (6,2) now body, then (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). Tail (4,3) is removed.\n\nPositions: new head at (6,1), then the body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,2) moves to where head was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving, new head at new position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo positions list: before move: [H: (6,2), B1: (6,3), B2: (5,3), B3: (5,2), B4: (4,2), T: (4,3)]\n\nAfter move D to (6,1): new head at (6,1), then B1 moves to where H was, (6,2), B2 moves to where B1 was, (6,3)? Let's index.\n\nLet S_t = positions at turn t: [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5] where P0 head, P5 tail.\n\nAfter move to new position Q, new positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4] and tail P5 is removed if no food eaten.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten, so new snake: head at (6,1), then P0 (6,2), P1 (6,3), P2 (5,3), P3 (5,2), P4 (4,2). And P5 (4,3) is removed.\n\nSo positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nTail is now (4,2).\n\nHead at (6,1), direction was D, so now head direction is D.\n\nNow turn 17, head at (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (opposite of D).\n\nSo can move D, L, R.\n\nNow adjacent cells:\n\n- D: (6,1-1) = (6,0) — but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- L: (6-1,1) = (5,1)\n\n- R: (6+1,1) = (7,1) — x=7 wall, invalid\n\n- U: (6,1+1) = (6,2) — but (6,2) is now occupied by body? New positions: (6,1) head, (6,2) body, so moving U to (6,2) would be collision.\n\nAlso, U is opposite direction? Current direction is D, opposite is U, so cannot move U anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (6,0) wall, invalid; R to (7,1) wall, invalid; L to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is a food position, and it's empty? Snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). No (5,1), so yes, (5,1) is empty and has food.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nBut is it safe? Moving to (5,1), which has food, so snake will eat it.\n\nFood at (5,1) has value 1, positive, so snake grows.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), since food eaten, tail not removed, new head at (5,1), then body: previous head (6,1) and so on.\n\nPositions: before move: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ]\n\nMove L to (5,1): new head at (5,1), then add the previous positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ] and tail (4,2) remains, but since food eaten, length increases, so tail not removed, positions now 7 segments.\n\nSnake grows when food eaten, so new length is old length +1.\n\nOld length 6, eat food, new length 7.\n\nPositions: new head at (5,1), then the previous positions from index 0 to 5: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). So [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ]\n\nTail is (4,2).\n\nHead now at (5,1), direction from (6,1) to (5,1) is left, so head direction L.\n\nNow, this is turn 17.\n\nBut I need to think from turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, if I move D to (6,1), then at turn 17, I must move L to (5,1) to eat food, which is good, +1 score.\n\nBut then what?\n\nAfter eating at (5,1), head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nNow possible moves: from (5,1), cannot move R (opposite of L), so can move U, D, L.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- U: (5,1+1) = (5,2)\n\n- D: (5,1-1) = (5,0) — y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (5-1,1) = (4,1)\n\n- R: (6,1) — but R is opposite, cannot move.\n\n(6,1) is body, anyway.\n\nNow (5,2) : in positions, (5,2) is the sixth segment? Positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ]\n\nIndex 0: (5,1) head, index 1: (6,1), index 2: (6,2), index 3: (6,3), index 4: (5,3), index 5: (5,2), index 6: (4,2) tail.\n\nSo (5,2) is index 5, body segment.\n\nMoving U to (5,2) would be collision.\n\nL to (4,1): what is (4,1)? Not wall, not in snake positions? Positions have (4,2) but not (4,1), so empty? Internal obstacle at (3,1), but (4,1) not obstacle.\n\nFood? No food at (4,1), only at (4,3), (4,4), (5,1) eaten.\n\n(5,1) food eaten, so gone.\n\nOther food at (4,3) and (4,4).\n\n(4,1) empty.\n\nSo from (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,2) body, collision invalid\n\n- D: (5,0) wall invalid\n\n- L: (4,1) empty, valid\n\n- R: cannot, opposite direction.\n\nSo only L to (4,1) is possible.\n\nThen move to (4,1), no food, so tail removed? After moving, new head at (4,1), then body: previous head (5,1), and segments, tail (4,2) removed? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ]\n\nMove to (4,1), no food eaten (assuming), so new positions: head at (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2). Tail (4,2) removed.\n\nNow snake: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nHead at (4,1), direction L (since from (5,1) to (4,1) left).\n\nNow turn 18 or something, but let's continue.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: cannot move R (opposite), so U, D, L.\n\n- U: (4,1+1) = (4,2)\n\n- D: (4,1-1) = (4,0) wall invalid\n\n- L: (4-1,1) = (3,1)\n\n- R: cannot\n\n(4,2): in positions, (4,2) was tail but removed, now in new positions? Current positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is at index 6, (4,2) not present, so (4,2) empty? But earlier tail was (4,2), removed, so empty.\n\n(4,2) not occupied, but is there food? Food at (4,3) and (4,4), not (4,2).\n\nBut (4,3) has food, under body? In positions, (5,3) is index 4, (6,3) index 3, etc., no (4,3) in current positions? Positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) — so (4,3) not here, it was earlier but removed? In initial, (4,3) was tail, but after moves, it was removed when no food eaten.\n\nAt turn 16, tail was (4,3), after move to (6,1) no eat, tail removed, so (4,3) free? But food is at (4,3), so the food is there, but snake not on it now.\n\nIn the state, food at (4,3) with life span 7, value 1.\n\nAt turn 17, after move to (5,1), positions include (5,2), (4,2), but not (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is food location.\n\nBack to (4,1) head.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (4,2): (4,2) is empty, no snake, no wall, so valid.\n\nD to (4,0) wall invalid.\n\nL to (3,1): (3,1) is internal obstacle, so invalid, collision.\n\nR cannot.\n\nSo only U to (4,2) possible.\n\nMove to (4,2), no food? (4,2) not food position, food at (4,3), (4,4), (5,1) eaten.\n\nSo no eat, tail removed.\n\nBefore move: positions [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nAfter move U to (4,2): new head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). Tail (5,2) removed.\n\nSnake: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nHead at (4,2), direction from (4,1) to (4,2) is up, so U.\n\nNow from (4,2), possible moves: cannot move D (opposite of U), so can move U, L, R.\n\n- U: (4,2+1) = (4,3)\n\n- D: cannot\n\n- L: (4-1,2) = (3,2)\n\n- R: (4+1,2) = (5,2)\n\nNow (4,3) has food, and is it occupied? Current positions: (4,2) head, (4,1), (5,1), etc., no (4,3), so empty? But food at (4,3), so moving to (4,3) would eat food.\n\n(3,2): not wall, no obstacle, not in snake positions? Positions have (3,2)? No, (3,1) obstacle, but (3,2) should be free.\n\n(5,2): in positions, (5,3) is tail? Positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — so (5,2) not present, (5,3) is last, so (5,2) empty? But earlier it was removed.\n\n(5,2) empty.\n\nBut (4,3) has food.\n\nSo from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) to eat food, or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\nAll possible except D.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (4,3), eat food, grow.\n\nThen snake: new head at (4,3), then body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), etc., and tail not removed, so length 8.\n\nBut (4,3) was food, eaten.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nNow, the problem is that there might be a tail reward danger if I eat food adjacent to tail.\n\nBut tail is at (5,3), and head at (4,3), after eating.\n\nPositions after eating: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — (5,3) is tail.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (4,3), I eat the food, but the food was on (4,3), not on the tail cell.\n\nThe tail cell is (5,3), which may or may not have food, but in this case, (5,3) is part of snake, and food was at (4,3), not at tail.\n\nTail reward danger is when the head moves onto a cell that has food and that cell is the current tail position, but since tail moves, it's only dangerous if head is adjacent to tail before moving and tail has food, but when you eat it, the tail grows back.\n\nFrom rules: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, before moving to (4,3), head is at (4,2), tail is at (5,3).\n\n(4,2) and (5,3) are not adjacent; (4,2) to (5,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in x or y but not both.\n\n(4,2) and (5,3): dx=1, dy=1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nAdjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (4,2) adjacent: (4,3), (4,1), (3,2), (5,2).\n\nTail at (5,3), which is not adjacent to (4,2); it's diagonal.\n\nSo no adjacency, so no tail reward danger.\n\nMoving to (4,3) is safe, eat food.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, if I move D to (6,1), then at turn 17, I move L to (5,1) eat food, then at turn 18, I move L to (4,1), then at turn 19, move U to (4,2), then at turn 20, move U to (4,3) eat food.\n\nSo I can eat two foods: (5,1) and (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) food has life span 7, which at turn 16, life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, including current, so from turn 16, it has 7 turns: t16,17,18,19,20,21,22, gone at t23.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) life span 4: t16,17,18,19, gone t20.\n\nAt turn 16, life span 4, so it disappears after 4 turns, meaning it exists for turns 16,17,18,19, and disappears before turn 20 or at turn 20? \"Disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span L, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor (5,1) at t16, life span 4, so exists turns 16,17,18,19, disappears at turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) life span 7, exists turns 16 to 22, disappears at 23.\n\n(4,4) life span 10, longer.\n\nIn the path above, at turn 17, I eat (5,1), good.\n\nAt turn 20, I eat (4,3), which is before it disappears.\n\nThen I can go for (4,4).\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nAt turn 16, from (6,2), I only have one choice: D to (6,1), because other moves are invalid.\n\nIs that true?\n\nEarlier I thought U, L, R all invalid, only D possible.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction D.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U to (6,3): occupied by body, collision\n\n- D to (6,1): empty\n\n- L to (5,2): occupied by body (index 3, (5,2))\n\n- R to (7,2): wall\n\nYes, only D possible at turn 16.\n\nSo I must move D to (6,1).\n\nThen at turn 17, from (6,1), as above, only L to (5,1) possible, eat food.\n\nThen turn 18, from (5,1), only L to (4,1) possible.\n\nThen turn 19, from (4,1), only U to (4,2) possible.\n\nThen turn 20, from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) to eat food, or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\nNow, moving U to (4,3) eats food, good.\n\nBut after that, head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nThen I can move to (4,4) to eat another food, or other directions.\n\n(4,4) is above.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nFirst, at turn 20, after moving to (4,3) if I choose.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead from turn 16.\n\nSince I must move D at turn 16, then the sequence is fixed for a few moves.\n\nAt turn 20, from (4,2), I have choices.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 16: move D to (6,1)\n\nThen snake positions: as before, [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)] tail (4,3) removed? Earlier calculation.\n\nAt turn 16 start: positions [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nMove D to (6,1), no eat, so new positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)  // tail (4,3) removed\n\nTurn 17: head at (6,1), direction D, move L to (5,1) eat food (5,1), so grow, new positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)  // since eat, tail not removed, so positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)] length 7\n\nTurn 18: head at (5,1), direction L (since from (6,1) to (5,1) left), move L to (4,1) no food, so new positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)  // tail (4,2) removed\n\nPositions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nTurn 19: head at (4,1), direction L, move U to (4,2) no food? (4,2) not food, so new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail (5,2) removed\n\nSnake: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 20: from (4,2), I can move:\n\n- U to (4,3): has food, eat\n\n- L to (3,2): empty\n\n- R to (5,2): empty\n\n- D: cannot, opposite\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), eat food, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // eat, so tail not removed, now length 8\n\nTail is (5,3)\n\nHead at (4,3), tail at (5,3), adjacent horizontally.\n\nNow, if I eat food at (4,3), it's fine, no tail reward danger because when I moved, head was at (4,2), tail at (5,3), not adjacent.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), adjacent, but that's ok, as long as I don't eat the tail cell.\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can move to (4,4) to eat another food.\n\n(4,4) is food.\n\nMove U to (4,4).\n\nThen eat, grow.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 20, move U to (4,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 21: head at (4,3), direction U, move U to (4,4) eat food (4,4).\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // eat, grow, length 9\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nNow, from here, I need to find a way out, but the snake is coiled, and I have to avoid collisions.\n\nAvailable moves from (4,4): cannot D, so U, L, R.\n\n- U: (4,5)\n\n- L: (3,4)\n\n- R: (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,5): not wall, empty? Snake positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — no (4,5), so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4): empty, no wall.\n\n(5,4): empty.\n\nBut (5,3) is body, but (5,4) is different.\n\n(5,3) is position, (5,4) is above.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles: (3,1) obstacle, but (3,4) ok.\n\nSo all possible.\n\nBut if I move U to (4,5), then continue, but I might get stuck later.\n\nSince the snake is long, and space is limited.\n\nAnother option at turn 20 from (4,2): instead of moving U to (4,3), I could move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), for example.\n\nAt turn 20, from (4,2), move R to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is empty, no food, so move, no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail (5,3) removed? Before move positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nMove to (5,2): new head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Tail (5,3) removed.\n\nSnake: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nHead at (5,2), direction from (4,2) to (5,2) is right, so R.\n\nThen from (5,2), cannot move L (opposite), so can move U, D, R.\n\n- U: (5,3) — but (5,3) is now removed, but in positions, after move, (6,3) is there, but (5,3) not present, so empty? But (5,3) was tail, removed, so (5,3) free? But food was at (4,3), not (5,3).\n\n(5,3) no food.\n\nMoving U to (5,3): empty, valid.\n\n- D: (5,1) — but (5,1) is body, index 3? Positions: (5,2) head, (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — so (5,1) is index 3, body, so moving D to (5,1) collision.\n\n- R: (6,2) — (6,2) is index 5, body, collision.\n\n- L: cannot.\n\nSo only U to (5,3) possible.\n\nMove to (5,3), no food? (5,3) not food position, food at (4,3), (4,4).\n\nSo no eat, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail (6,3) removed.\n\nHead direction U (since y increased from 2 to 3).\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or other, but (5,4) has no food, or to (4,3) to eat, etc.\n\nBut I missed eating (4,3) food.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved L to (3,2) at turn 20.\n\nBut eating the food is better for score.\n\nIn the first path, by turn 21, I can eat two foods: (5,1) and (4,3), and then (4,4).\n\n(4,4) at turn 21.\n\nLife span: (4,4) life span 10, at turn 16, so exists until turn 25.\n\nNow, back to turn 16, since I must move D, the sequence to eat foods seems good.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nAfter eating (4,4), snake is around (4,4) with long body.\n\nPositions after eating (4,4) at turn 21: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is empty, (3,4) empty, (4,5) empty.\n\nSay move U to (4,5).\n\nThen no food, so tail removed, etc.\n\nBut the space might be tight with the body.\n\nSince the grid has internal obstacle at (3,1), but not affecting directly.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,3) was under the body initially, but we moved away and ate it.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 16.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1=16.\n\nBut I need to specify actions for several turns, but since the AI decides each turn, I should output a sequence, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for the immediate and perhaps a few more.\n\nThe format says: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd \"prioritize long-term survival\".\n\nIn this case, at turn 16, only one action: D.\n\nThen at turn 17, only L to eat food.\n\nBut for thinking ahead, I should consider if there is a way to avoid potential dead ends.\n\nIn the current path, after eating foods, the snake might be in a position where it can explore more.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), moving to (4,5), then to (4,6), etc., but y=7 top wall.\n\ny=7 top, so (4,6) to (4,7) but y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo need to turn left or right.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nSince all foods are positive, eating them is good.\n\nAnother food is at (4,4), which I can eat.\n\nIn the sequence, I eat (5,1) at turn 17, (4,3) at turn 20, (4,4) at turn 21.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other areas.\n\nBut the snake body is taking space, and with walls, I need to avoid boxing myself.\n\nFor example, after positions with head at (4,4), body down to (5,3), etc., the area to the left and right might be free.\n\nI can move R to (5,4), for instance.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating available foods is key.\n\nNow, at turn 16, action must be D.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n\nBut for the output, I need to list actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence I have.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, from turn 16 to 21.\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: L (to eat (5,1))\n\nTurn 18: L (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 19: U (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 20: U (to (4,3) eat)\n\nThen turn 21: U (to (4,4) eat)\n\nBut at turn 20, from (4,2), moving U to (4,3) is eating, good.\n\nThen at turn 21, from (4,3), moving U to (4,4) to eat.\n\nNow, is this the only way? At turn 20, I could go elsewhere, but eating is better.\n\nMoreover, (4,3) food disappears at turn 23, so eating at turn 20 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) can be eaten later if not now.\n\nBut in this path, I eat it at turn 21.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, after that, I need to find a path without colliding.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), instead of U to (4,5), I could move R to (5,4) to go to the right side.\n\n(5,4) is free, then to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (6,4) might be free, depending.\n\nSince the grid is 8x8 with borders, and obstacle at (3,1), not blocking.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nBut let's confirm if at turn 16, there is any other possibility.\n\nPerhaps I missed a move.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,3) is under the tail initially, but as we move, we can eat it.\n\nIn the sequence, it works.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output:\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: L\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U  (to eat (4,3))\n\nThen for turn 21, from (4,3), move U to (4,4) to eat, but I need to specify up to where.\n\nThe thinking ahead is for decision, but output the actions.\n\nSince at each turn I can decide based on state, but for this response, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nThe instruction is to think ahead but output actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list a few turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: to turn 20 or 21.\n\nSince turn 16 to 20 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 16,17,18,19,20: that's 5 turns.\n\nt1=16, t1 to t1+4.\n\nTurn 16,17,18,19,20.\n\nActions: D, L, L, U, U\n\nAt turn 20, moving U to (4,3) eats food.\n\nThen beyond, but I can stop there, as the state will change.\n\nTo show long-term, I can include up to eating the second food.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (4,3) at turn 20, I eat the food, but the tail is at (5,3), which is adjacent, but since I'm not eating the tail cell, it should be fine.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), adjacent, but I can move away, e.g., to (4,4) or (3,3) or (5,3) but (5,3) is tail, cannot move there.\n\n(5,3) is body, moving to it would collide.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3) but (5,3) body, invalid, D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, invalid.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), etc., so (4,2) is adjacent body, cannot move D.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is body, cannot move R.\n\nSo from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), or L to (3,3), or if (4,4) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) might be free.\n\nIn turn 20 action U to (4,3), then at turn 21, I can move U to (4,4) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence, it's consistent.\n\nFor the output, I think:\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: L\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen if I want, I can add Turn 21: U to (4,4), but not necessary.\n\nSince the food at (4,4) has long life, I could delay, but eating now is fine.\n\nBut in the path, it's available.\n\nTo avoid potential risk, but I think it's ok.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 19, when I move to (4,2), the food at (4,3) is still there, and I move directly to it.\n\nIf I had moved differently, but I have no choice earlier.\n\nSo I think the sequence is forced until turn 19, and at turn 20, moving U to eat is best.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} }\n\nBut to be precise, in the action, it's the direction.\n\nAnd in the format, it says \"action on turn\", so for each turn.\n\nYes.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 16 and Beyond\n\n**Current State (Turn 16):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid (x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7) with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1). y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top; U increases y, D decreases y.\n- **Snake**: Head at (6,2), direction D (down).

This leads to a sequence where:\n  - Turn 17: Must move L to (5,1) to eat positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 7).\n  - Turn 18: Must move L to (4,1) (no food, tail removed).\n  - Turn 19: Must move U to (4,2) (no food, tail removed).\n  - Turn 20: From (4,2), multiple options exist, but moving U to (4,3) eats the positive food under the former tail position (+1 score, snake grows to length 8). This is safe because:\n    - Head at (4,2) and tail at (5,3) are not adjacent (diagonal), so no tail reward danger.\n    - (4,3) food disappears after turn 22; eating at turn 20 is timely.\n- **Long-term considerations (beyond turn 20)**:\n  - After eating (4,3) at turn 20, head moves to (4,4) at turn 21 to eat another positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 9). This leverages the food's long life span (disappears after turn 25).\n  - Survival focus: After turn 21, the snake must navigate carefully to avoid boxing itself due to increased length. Options include moving right (e.g., to (5,4)) to access open spaces, avoiding the internal obstacle at (3,1) and walls.\n  - Risk avoidance: No negative food present, so all foods are beneficial. The path to (4,3) and (4,4) is low-risk as collisions are avoided, and food under body is safely eaten after moving away.\n- **Score maximization**: This plan eats 3 foods by turn 21 (score +3), utilizing all available positive foods before they expire. Delaying (4,4) is possible but suboptimal due to decay; eating early secures points.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 16-21):**\n- Turn 16: Move D (down) to (6,1) – only safe option.\n- Turn 17: Move L (left) to (5,1) – eats food, score +1.\n- Turn 18: Move L (left) to (4,1) – necessary path.\n- Turn 19: Move U (up) to (4,2) – prepares to eat (4,3).\n- Turn 20: Move U (up) to (4,3) – eats food, score +1.\n- Turn 21: Move U (up) to (4,4) – eats food, score +1 (optimal; alternative moves like L or R avoid food but reduce score).\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating all reachable foods quickly while ensuring survival through forced moves and careful planning. Beyond turn 21, the snake should prioritize open areas to avoid dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 17, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a corner wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x can be from 1 to 6. Similarly for y, from 1 to 6. But let's confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1). So playable cells are where x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). So let's list them:\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,2)  // tail\n\nSnake has 6 segments. Head direction is Down, which is decreasing y? Let's clarify directions:\n\nU: (x, y+1) - up, increasing y\n\nD: (x, y-1) - down, decreasing y\n\nL: (x-1, y) - left, decreasing x\n\nR: (x+1, y) - right, increasing x\n\nHead direction is D, so moving down, which is decreasing y. Head is at (6,1), moving down would go to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. But the snake is at (6,1) with direction D, so it must have come from above? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nHead at (6,1), then (6,2), which is directly above since y increases up? In grid coordinates, usually (0,0) is top-left, y increasing down, but here the directions are defined: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increasing up or down?\n\nThe direction says U: (x,y+1). In standard grid, if (0,0) is top-left, U (up) would decrease y, but here it says U: (x,y+1), so y+1 means up? I think I need to interpret the coordinate system.\n\nPerhaps in this system, y increases as we go up, like in math coordinates. Let's see the positions.\n\nHead at (6,1), segment at (6,2). Since head is first, and it's moving down, direction D: (x,y-1).\n\nFrom (6,2) to (6,1) is decreasing y, so if y decreases down, that means (6,2) is above (6,1), so y=2 is higher than y=1? Let's think.\n\nAssume the grid: (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The wall description says y=0 and y=7 are borders. But it doesn't specify orientation.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the positions: snake has (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). If head is at (6,1) and next is (6,2), that means from (6,2) to (6,1) is moving down if y decreases as we go down. But the direction is given as D, which is down.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of movement.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,1)\n\nDirection: D, which means last move was to (6,1) from the previous position. Since positions are head first, the previous head was at (6,2), and it moved down to (6,1), so from (6,2) to (6,1) with y decreasing, so y=2 is above y=1, meaning y increases as we go up? I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's read the direction definition: U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, so U: y increases, D: y decreases. So if U is up, y increases up, like math coordinates where (0,0) is bottom-left. In that case, moving U increases y, so from lower y to higher y.\n\nSimilarly, D decreases y, from higher y to lower y.\n\nIn the snake positions: from (6,2) to (6,1), y decreased, so it moved down. Head at (6,1), which has lower y than (6,2), so (6,2) is above (6,1) if y increases up.\n\nBut let's list all positions:\n\n- (6,1) head\n\n- (6,2) body\n\n- (6,3) body\n\n- (5,3) body\n\n- (5,2) body\n\n- (4,2) tail\n\nFrom (6,3) to (5,3), x decreased, so left.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,2), y decreased, so down.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (4,2), x decreased, left.\n\nSo the snake is moving: head at (6,1) with direction D, meaning it just moved down to (6,1).\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,1): since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (opposite) on next turn.\n\nPossible moves from (6,1):\n\n- U: (x,y+1) = (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by the snake body, so if I move there, I collide with body.\n\n- D: (x,y-1) = (6,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- L: (x-1,y) = (5,1)\n\n- R: (x+1,y) = (7,1) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nx=7 is wall, so R to (7,1) is invalid.\n\nSo from (6,1), possible moves are only L to (5,1), since U and D and R are all invalid or occupied.\n\nU to (6,2) is occupied by snake body segment, so collision.\n\nD to (6,0) is wall.\n\nR to (7,1) is wall.\n\nOnly L to (5,1) is possible? But (5,1) might have food or not.\n\nFirst, let's list the food:\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,1) with value 1, life_span 3? Food is given as (x,y, life_span, value) I think.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (5, 1, 3, 1) - (4, 3, 6, 1) - (4, 4, 9, 1)\"\n\nSo:\n\n- Food at (5,1): value=1, life_span=3\n\n- Food at (4,3): value=1, life_span=6\n\n- Food at (4,4): value=1, life_span=9\n\nAll positive food since value=1, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 17, so for (5,1), life_span=3, meaning it will disappear after turn 17+3-1? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it exists for turns t to t+L-1? Countdown decreases every turn.\n\nAt turn 17, life_span is given, so for (5,1), life_span=3 at turn 17, meaning after 3 more turns, it disappears? Countdown decreases including current turn, so at turn 17, countdown=3, after turn 17 it becomes 2, after turn 18 it becomes 1, after turn 19 it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten on turns 17,18,19? Countdown: at turn t, if life_span L, it has countdown L, decreases each turn, so when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 17, countdown starts at L for that turn.\n\nFor (5,1): life_span=3 at turn 17, so countdown=3 on turn 17. After turn 17, countdown=2 for turn 18, countdown=1 for turn 19, countdown=0 for turn 20, but disappears after countdown 0, so last chance to eat is turn 19? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it will be present for that turn, and countdown decreases by 1 after the turn? The description is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAssume that \"life_span\" is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn.\n\nFor example, if life_span=1, it exists only for the current turn and disappears immediately after.\n\nIf life_span=2, it exists for current turn and next turn, etc.\n\nIn the input, it's given at turn 17, so for (5,1) with life_span=3, it means it will disappear after turn 19 (since turn 17,18,19 it exists, after turn 19 it's gone).\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) life_span=6, exists from turn 17 to 22 (17+6-1=22? Turns: 17,18,19,20,21,22, that's 6 turns, yes).\n\nLife_span=6, so 6 turns including current: turns 17 to 22 inclusive? 17,18,19,20,21,22, that's 6 turns, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life_span=9, exists turns 17 to 25.\n\nAll food has value=1, positive.\n\nNow back to possible moves from (6,1) at turn 17.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U: (6,2) but occupied by snake body, so if move there, head collides with body, death.\n\n- D: (6,0) y=0 wall, death.\n\n- L: (5,1) - this cell has food, and is not occupied by snake or wall? Snake positions are (6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(5,3),(5,2),(4,2). So (5,1) is not in snake, and not wall, so it's free, but has food.\n\n- R: (7,1) x=7 wall, death.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nBut is (5,1) safe? Moving to (5,1) would eat the food there, since head moves onto food cell.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake grows by one segment because it's positive food, so length increases.\n\nCurrent snake length 6, after eating, length 7.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nThe instruction says to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nLet's see the tail.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,2).\n\nHead at (6,1), tail at (4,2), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,1) and (4,2) are not adjacent; difference in x=2, y=1, not adjacent.\n\nPossible adjacent cells: (5,1), (6,2), (7,1), (6,0), but (6,2) is body, others walls except (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is adjacent to head? Head at (6,1), (5,1) is left, so yes, adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut tail is at (4,2), which is not (5,1), so no issue.\n\nIf I move to (5,1), I eat the food, snake grows, new head at (5,1), and tail remains until next move? When snake eats, it grows on the next move, I think.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows by one cell at the head, tail stays.\n\nBut here, after moving to food, the length increases immediately, and the tail position will be the same until the snake moves again.\n\nIn terms of positions: when head moves to food, it occupies that cell, and since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the new position has head at (5,1), and body segments: the old head (6,1) becomes body, then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), and tail at (4,2) stays.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1) and eating, the snake positions become: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), and tail (4,2). Length 7.\n\nThen on next turn, when snake moves, the tail will move only if no food eaten, but since food was eaten, tail stays, so after move, the new head position, and tail remains, so length increases.\n\nBut for collision, we need to see the state after move.\n\nNow, after moving to (5,1), the head is at (5,1), and direction is now L, since I moved left.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1), so direction L.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,1) at turn 18.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns.\n\nFirst, I have to move to (5,1) at turn 17, because it's the only possible move. No choice, otherwise I die immediately.\n\nIs that true?\n\nFrom (6,1), only L to (5,1) is possible, all other directions lead to death.\n\nSo for turn 17, I must move L to (5,1).\n\nThen, at turn 17, I eat the food at (5,1), so snake grows to length 7.\n\nPositions after turn 17: head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), tail (4,2). So segments: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). Length 7.\n\nDirection: since I moved left to (5,1), current direction is L.\n\nNow, turn 18: I need to choose action from (5,1).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (x,y+1) = (5,2) but (5,2) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (5,2) is a body segment, yes, so moving to (5,2) would collide with body.\n\n- D: (x,y-1) = (5,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- L: (x-1,y) = (4,1)\n\n- R: (x+1,y) = (6,1) but (6,1) is occupied by snake body, collision.\n\n(6,1) is the second segment now.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,2) occupied, D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1), R to (6,1) occupied.\n\nOnly L to (4,1) is possible? (4,1) is not occupied? Snake positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). So (4,1) is free? And not wall.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (3,1).\n\n(4,1) is x=4,y=1, not border, not (3,1), so it should be free.\n\nAlso, no food at (4,1), I think.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,4), not (4,1).\n\nSo from (5,1), only possible move is L to (4,1).\n\nNo other choice, otherwise death.\n\nSo turn 18: move L to (4,1).\n\nNo food eaten, so snake moves, head to (4,1), tail moves away from (4,2)? When no food, tail moves.\n\nAfter move: head at (4,1), then body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), and tail was (4,2), but since no food, tail moves forward? In snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, the tail leaves the last cell.\n\nSo positions after move: head (4,1), then the previous head (5,1) becomes body, and so on, up to the segment before tail. Tail was (4,2), but since no food, the tail moves to the position of the second last segment or something.\n\nLet's think: before move, positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ] with head (5,1), tail (4,2).\n\nAfter moving head to (4,1), the new head is (4,1), and the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed if no food eaten. Since no food, tail does not grow, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2). Tail is now (5,2), since (4,2) is left.\n\nLength back to 6? No, after eating at turn 17, length was 7. Then at turn 18, no food, so when moving, the tail moves, so length remains 7, but the tail position changes.\n\nStandard: after eating, the snake has grown, so when it moves without eating, the tail moves, so length stays the same.\n\nIn this case: after turn 17, positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ] length 7.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,1) at turn 18, new head (4,1), then the first body segment is (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), and the tail (4,2) is not included, so positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) ] length 7, tail at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) was previously body, now tail.\n\nDirection: moved left to (4,1), so direction L.\n\nNow turn 19: head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (x,y+1) = (4,2)\n\n- D: (x,y-1) = (4,0) y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (x-1,y) = (3,1) but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n\n- R: (x+1,y) = (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2). So (5,1) is second segment, occupied.\n\nSo U to (4,2): is (4,2) occupied? (4,2) is not in the positions; positions are (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2). (4,2) is not there, so free? But (4,2) might have something.\n\n(4,2) is a cell, not wall, not occupied currently.\n\nBut there is food at (4,3) and (4,4), not (4,2).\n\nSo U to (4,2) should be possible.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (5,1) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (4,2).\n\nThus turn 19: move U to (4,2).\n\nNo food at (4,2), so no eat, tail moves.\n\nAfter move: head at (4,2), then body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and tail was (5,2), but since no food, tail moves, so new positions: [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] length 7, tail at (5,3).\n\nDirection: moved up to (4,2), so direction U.\n\nNow turn 20: head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (x,y+1) = (4,3) - there is food at (4,3), value=1, life_span=6 at turn 17, but now turn 20.\n\nLife_span: at turn 17, (4,3) had life_span=6, so countdown: turn 17:6, 18:5, 19:4, 20:3, so still present.\n\n- D: (x,y-1) = (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by snake body, second segment.\n\n- L: (x-1,y) = (3,2)\n\n- R: (x+1,y) = (5,2)\n\nNow, (3,2) and (5,2) are possible? (5,2) is not occupied? Positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So (5,2) is not there, free. Similarly, (3,2) free.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,2) is different.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,2) is playable.\n\nNow, U to (4,3) has food.\n\nBut we need to think if eating it is safe.\n\nFirst, head at (4,2), tail at (5,3).\n\nAre they adjacent? (4,2) and (5,3): x diff 1, y diff 1, so diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n\nSo (4,2) and (5,3) are not adjacent; adjacent cells would be (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is not tail, tail is (5,3).\n\nSo no issue with tail food danger.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), I eat the food, snake grows, new head at (4,3), and tail stays at (5,3) for now.\n\nBut after eating, positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — (5,3) is still there, but (5,3) is the last segment, tail.\n\nSince I ate food, tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] length 8.\n\n(5,3) is now part of body, and the tail is still (5,3)? No, when head moves to new cell, and eats, the tail remains, so the segment that was tail stays, and a new head is added, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, before move, tail was (5,3), after eating at (4,3), the tail (5,3) remains, so positions: head (4,3), then previous segments: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3). (6,3) is before tail? Let's list: after move to (4,3) and eat, positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) — but (6,3) and (5,3) are both, but (5,3) was tail, now it's the last segment.\n\nThe segments are: after adding head, the body includes all previous positions including the old tail, so positions: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] and tail at (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is occupied by the tail.\n\nNow, head is at (4,3), which has food, eaten.\n\nNow, for the tail food danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but here tail is at (5,3), which has no food, food was at (4,3), eaten now.\n\nBut (5,3) itself may or may not have food; in this case, no food there.\n\nNow, after this, on next turn, when we move, if no food, tail moves.\n\nBut back to turn 20 choices.\n\nI could move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) instead of U to (4,3).\n\nBut U to (4,3) is possible and has food, which is good for score.\n\nBut let's see the options.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (4,3), I eat food, grow to length 8.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 21: head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (4,4) - there is food at (4,4), value=1, life_span=9 at turn 17, now turn 21? At turn 17, life_span=9, so turn 17 to 25, countdown from 9 to 1, present.\n\n- D: (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by snake body, second segment? After positions: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), ... ] so (4,2) is body, cannot move there.\n\n- L: (3,3)\n\n- R: (5,3) but (5,3) is the tail, but in the positions, (5,3) is occupied by the tail segment.\n\nIf I move to (5,3), head collides with body segment at (5,3).\n\nCurrently (5,3) is part of the snake, so moving there causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (4,2) is body.\n\nU to (4,4) is possible, and has food.\n\nL to (3,3) possible, no food.\n\nSo from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4) or L to (3,3).\n\nR and D invalid.\n\nNow, if I go U to (4,4), eat another food, grow to length 9.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nThen turn 22: from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,5)\n\n- D: (4,3) occupied, body\n\n- L: (3,4)\n\n- R: (5,4)\n\nAll U, L, R possible except D.\n\nBut we have food at (4,4) eaten, now no food there.\n\nBut at (4,4) we ate, so on turn 22, from (4,4), move to say (4,5) or others.\n\nBut let's not get too ahead.\n\nBack to turn 20, I could choose not to eat at (4,3) and go elsewhere.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) at turn 20.\n\nIf I move L to (3,2) at turn 20.\n\nHead at (4,2) to (3,2), direction L.\n\nNo food at (3,2), so no eat.\n\nAfter move: head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — tail was (5,3), but no eat, so tail moves? Before move, positions: [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] tail (5,3)\n\nAfter move head to (3,2), new positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) not included, so [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] length 7, tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 21: head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,3)\n\n- D: (3,1) but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n\n- L: (2,2)\n\n- R: (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied\n\nSo U to (3,3) or L to (2,2)\n\nNo food at (3,3) or (2,2), so no eat.\n\nIf U to (3,3), then head (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I have food at (4,3) which might expire or be eaten later.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 20 I move R to (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (5,2), direction R.\n\n(5,2) is free? Positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — (5,2) not occupied, so yes.\n\nNo food at (5,2), so no eat.\n\nAfter move: head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) removed? No eat, so positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] length 7, tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 21: head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied? After positions, (6,3) is body, (5,3) not in positions, but (5,3) was tail before, but now not.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] so (5,3) is free.\n\nU to (5,3): no food\n\nD: (5,1) but (5,1) is body, occupied\n\nL: (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied\n\nR: (6,2) but (6,2) is body, occupied\n\n(6,2) is in positions, yes.\n\nSo only possible move U to (5,3)? U to (5,3) is (5,2+1)=(5,3)\n\n(5,3) is not occupied, so yes.\n\nD to (5,1) occupied, L to (4,2) occupied, R to (6,2) occupied.\n\nSo only U to (5,3).\n\nThen move to (5,3), no food? But there was food at (4,3), not (5,3).\n\n(5,3) has no food.\n\nAfter move: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (6,3) removed? Positions: [ (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] length 7, tail at (6,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) or other.\n\nBut (4,3) has food, which can be eaten later.\n\nBut let's think about the initial path.\n\nAt turn 17, I must move L to (5,1), eat food.\n\nTurn 18, move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 19, move U to (4,2)\n\nThen at turn 20, if I move U to (4,3), eat food, grow to 8.\n\nThen at turn 21, from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) to eat another food, or L to (3,3).\n\nIf I move U to (4,4) at turn 21, eat food, grow to 9.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 22: from (4,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,5)\n\nD to (4,3) occupied, body\n\nL to (3,4)\n\nR to (5,4)\n\nAll except D possible.\n\n(4,3) is body, yes.\n\nNow, no food around, so I can go to (4,5) or (3,4) or (5,4).\n\nFor example, if U to (4,5), then continue.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nThere is also the food at (4,4) which I ate, but now gone.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 20, if I eat at (4,3), and then at turn 21 eat at (4,4), I get two more points.\n\nBut let's see the life-span.\n\n(4,3) life-span 6 at turn 17, so at turn 20, countdown 3 (since 17:6,18:5,19:4,20:3), so still present.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life-span 9, at turn 21: from turn 17, countdown 9,18:8,19:7,20:6,21:5, so present.\n\nIf I don't eat at (4,3) on turn 20, it might disappear later.\n\nAt turn 20, (4,3) countdown 3, so after turn 20, countdown 2 on turn 21, then 1 on turn 22, 0 on turn 23, disappears after turn 22? At turn 22, if countdown 1, it can be eaten, then gone.\n\nBut in the path where I go to (3,2) or (5,2), I might not get back to (4,3) in time.\n\nFor example, if at turn 20 I move L to (3,2), then at turn 21 from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nIf U to (3,3), then head at (3,3), which is adjacent to (4,3), so I could move to (4,3) on turn 22 if possible.\n\nFrom (3,3), move R to (4,3), which has food.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 20 I move R to (5,2), then turn 21 move U to (5,3), then from (5,3) I can move L to (4,3) on turn 22.\n\nSo it's possible to eat (4,3) later.\n\nBut eating it on turn 20 might be safer or better for sequence.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, let's outline the moves from turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: must move L to (5,1), eat food, score +1, snake length 7.\n\nPositions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 18: must move L to (4,1), no eat, length 7.\n\nPositions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)]  // tail (5,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 19: must move U to (4,2), no eat, length 7.\n\nPositions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]  // tail (5,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow turn 20: choices.\n\nOption A: move U to (4,3), eat food, score +1, length 8.\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]  // tail (5,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,3), can move U to (4,4) or L to (3,3)\n\nIf move U to (4,4), eat food, score +1, length 9.\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]  // tail (5,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 22: from (4,4), can move U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nNo immediate threats, can choose.\n\nFor example, move U to (4,5), etc.\n\nOption B at turn 20: move L to (3,2) instead of U to (4,3)\n\nFrom (4,2) move L to (3,2), no eat.\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]  // tail (6,3) since (5,3) removed\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 21: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2) (D to (3,1) invalid)\n\nIf U to (3,3), no food.\n\nPositions: [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]  // tail (6,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 22: from (3,3), can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2) occupied, L to (2,3), R to (4,3)\n\nR to (4,3) has food, can eat.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 20 move R to (5,2), then turn 21 move U to (5,3), then turn 22 move L to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut in option A, I eat both (4,3) and (4,4) quickly, getting points.\n\nIn other options, I might eat (4,3) later, but (4,4) might be eaten or not.\n\n(4,4) has longer life, life_span 9, so can be eaten until turn 25.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is good.\n\nAlso, in option A, after eating (4,4), the snake is longer, which might be riskier, but the grid is 6x6 playable, walls at borders, and one obstacle.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, minus (3,1), so 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 9 after eating both, which is less than 35, so possible to survive.\n\nMoreover, with the path, after (4,4), I can go to (4,5), (4,6), etc., or left or right.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nIn the positions after eating (4,4), tail at (5,3), which is at (5,3), and head at (4,4).\n\nNot adjacent.\n\nNow, about the tail food danger: but no food at tail.\n\nAnother thing: when I ate at (5,1) on turn 17, that food was under the snake? No, (5,1) was free when I moved to it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) and (4,4) are free.\n\nBut there is a special case: food can spawn under snake body, but here it wasn't, and we eat when head moves to it.\n\nIn this case, all food is on free cells.\n\nNow, back to turn 20 decision.\n\nIf I don't eat at (4,3) now, and go to (3,2), I might not get the point if something happens.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,2), then to (3,3), then to (4,3) on turn 22, but (4,3) life-span: at turn 22, countdown 1 (from turn 17:6,18:5,19:4,20:3,21:2,22:1), so on turn 22 it can be eaten, then disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if I delay, I can still eat it.\n\nBut eating on turn 20 gives me the point earlier, and I can proceed to (4,4).\n\nAlso, after eating (4,3) and (4,4), the snake is longer, but I have more space.\n\nAnother risk: in the position after eating (4,3), at turn 20, positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3)\n\nNow, (5,3) is tail, and head is at (4,3), which is adjacent to (5,3)? (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAnd (5,3) has no food, but if it had food, eating it would be dangerous, but no food there.\n\nBut in general, here no issue.\n\nThen when I move to (4,4), no problem.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the foods when possible.\n\nMoreover, since I must think long-term, but in this case, from turn 17 to 19, I have no choice, only one move each.\n\nAt turn 20, I have a choice: I can move U to (4,3) or L to (3,2) or R to (5,2), but only U to (4,3) eats food, which is beneficial.\n\nMoving to (3,2) or (5,2) doesn't eat food and might lead to dead ends or risks.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,2), then I might get stuck.\n\n(3,2) to (3,3), then from (3,3), I can go to (3,4), (2,3), or (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, from (5,2) to (5,3), then to (5,4) or (4,3) or (6,3) but (6,3) might be occupied.\n\nBut overall, eating at (4,3) and (4,4) seems good.\n\nAlso, after that, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, probably at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 17, so I need to output turns 17,18,19,20,21, etc.\n\nSince at turn 17,18,19 I have only one choice, I can output those, and at turn 20, I choose to eat.\n\nThen for turn 21, I can choose to eat (4,4).\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn 17: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 18: move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 19: move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 20: move U to (4,3)  // eat\n\nThen turn 21: move U to (4,4)  // eat\n\nNow, after that, turn 22: from (4,4), I can move, say, U to (4,5) or other.\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nSince the grid has walls, from (4,4), moving U to (4,5) is safe, no immediate threat.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut to be precise, let's think if there is a better path.\n\nSuppose at turn 21, after (4,3), instead of moving U to (4,4), I move L to (3,3).\n\nThen from (4,3) to (3,3), direction L.\n\nNo food at (3,3).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) but after moving from (4,3) to (3,3), no eat, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] tail (5,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,3): new head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) removed? No eat, so positions: [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] length 8, tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I can go to (3,4) or (2,3), but (4,4) food is still there, I can go back later, but it might be inefficient.\n\nMoving directly to (4,4) is better to eat it.\n\nSo I think the greedy approach to eat available food is fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer, I can output:\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: L\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U  // to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: U  // to (4,4)\n\nNow, I need to go beyond, but since the question is to think 5+ turns, and output actions, I can do up to turn 21 or more.\n\nBut turn 21 is only 4 turns ahead from 17? Turn 17 action, then 18,19,20,21, that's 5 actions including turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: t1=17, action on t1\n\nTurn t1+1=18: action\n\n...\n\nSo for 5 turns: t17 to t21.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive.\n\nAt turn 21, after moving to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — after eating at (4,4), tail (5,3) remains.\n\nPositions: [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] length 9.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 22: from (4,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,5)\n\nD to (4,3) occupied, body\n\nL to (3,4)\n\nR to (5,4)\n\nAll U, L, R possible.\n\nNow, (4,5) has no food, (3,4) no, (5,4) no.\n\nI can choose to move U to (4,5) for example.\n\nThen continue.\n\nTo be safe, I should avoid going into corners.\n\nBut for now, since I need to output, I can set the actions.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) was eaten on turn 17, gone.\n\n(4,3) eaten on turn 20, (4,4) on turn 21.\n\nAll consumed.\n\nNow, no other food, so I need to survive.\n\nBut food might respawn or something? No, the state has only these foods, and they disappear after life-span, but no new food mentioned, so after these, no more food, I just need to survive as long as possible.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score by eating food, so eating all three foods is good, score 3.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate all three: (5,1) on 17, (4,3) on 20, (4,4) on 21.\n\nScore +3.\n\nIf I miss one, less score.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nTherefore, the actions:\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: L\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U  // to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: U  // to (4,4)\n\nFor turn 22, I can add if needed, but the answer format might allow multiple.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the box, I need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output for turns 17 to 21 or more.\n\nTo be safe, let's do 5 actions.\n\nSince at turn 22, I have choices, but for the plan, I can define.\n\nBut in the context, since no immediate threat, I can stop at turn 21.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I output the necessary actions.\n\nAnother point: in the initial move, when I moved to (5,1), it was the only choice, and similarly later.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated possible moves 5+ turns ahead. The grid is 8x8 with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,1). The snake starts at turn 17 with head at (6,1), direction Down, and positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]. Available food: (5,1) with value 1 (life_span 3, disappears after turn 19), (4,3) with value 1 (life_span 6, disappears after turn 22), and (4,4) with value 1 (life_span 9, disappears after turn 25).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Constraints**: At turn 17, the snake head is at (6,1) with direction Down. Only moving Left to (5,1) is safe (other moves cause collision or wall death). This eats the food at (5,1), increasing length to 7.\n- **Subsequent Moves**: Turns 18 and 19 have only one safe move each (Left to (4,1) then Up to (4,2)) due to body/wall constraints.\n- **Turn 20 Decision**: From (4,2), moving Up to (4,3) eats food and is safe. Alternatives (Left to (3,2) or Right to (5,2)) avoid food but risk missing opportunities or dead ends. Eating (4,3) now scores +1 and aligns with long-term survival, as the snake can then reach (4,4).\n- **Turn 21 Decision**: From (4,3), moving Up to (4,4) eats the last food, scoring +1. Moving Left to (3,3) avoids food but wastes a scoring chance, and (4,4) has ample life-span.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating all food (score +3), the snake must navigate safely. From (4,4) at turn 22, moving Up to (4,5) is chosen to avoid body collisions and open space. Beyond turn 22, the snake can explore areas like (4,6) or (5,5) to avoid trapping itself, but the focus here is on the critical 5-turn sequence.\n\n### Simulated Moves (Turns 17-22):\n1. **Turn 17**: Move Left (L) to (5,1) – Eats positive food at (5,1), score +1, length increases to 7. Only safe move; avoids death.\n2. **Turn 18**: Move Left (L) to (4,1) – No food; necessary to avoid walls/body. Length remains 7.\n3. **Turn 19**: Move Up (U) to (4,2) – No food; only safe move from (4,1). Length remains 7.\n4. **Turn 20**: Move Up (U) to (4,3) – Eats positive food at (4,3), score +1, length increases to 8. Safe and prioritizes scoring before food expires.\n5. **Turn 21**: Move Up (U) to (4,4) – Eats positive food at (4,4), score +1, length increases to 9. Optimal for scoring; avoids risk of missing food.\n6. **Turn 22**: Move Up (U) to (4,5) – No food; safe move to open area, avoiding collisions. Ensures survival for future turns.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats all available food (3 points) by turn 21, leveraging their life-spans ( (5,1) eaten before expiration at turn 19, (4,3) and (4,4) eaten with buffer).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: No moves cause collisions or wall hits. At turn 20, eating (4,3) is safe as the tail (at (5,3)) is not adjacent to the head, avoiding \"Tail Reward Danger\". Similarly, no food under the body is eaten unsafely.\n- **5+ Turn Planning**: The sequence accounts for grid constraints (e.g., obstacle at (3,1) avoided) and ensures the snake has space to maneuver post-turn 22 (e.g., from (4,5), options like (4,6), (3,5), or (5,5) exist).\n- **Alternative Avoided**: Not eating at (4,3) on turn 20 (e.g., moving Left) delays scoring and risks missing the food if the snake gets trapped, reducing potential score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: L \\\\\nTurn 18: L \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to confirm the coordinates.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). So the snake has 7 segments.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So it's moving left from (5,1).\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format is to output actions starting from turn t1=18, and I should specify for several turns, but it doesn't say how many; I think I should do at least 5 turns since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\".\n\nThe core rules: I need to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nImportant rules:\n\n- Food under snake body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\n- Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nMovement: Cannot instant reverse. Since head is moving left, I cannot move right on the next turn.\n\nDeadly collisions: Wall or body collision, except that moving into tail is ok because tail moves.\n\nCurrent snake positions: Let's list them in order:\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nBody: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nTail is (4,2)\n\nHead direction L, so it just moved from (6,1) to (5,1), I assume, since positions are given with head first.\n\nPositions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nSo from head to tail: (5,1) <- head\n\nThen (6,1) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail end is removed if no food eaten.\n\nFood: (4,3) and (4,4)\n\n(4,3) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn. So at turn 18, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 22? Let's see.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, food has life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t+N or something? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, at turn t+N, it has life span 0 and disappears. But when does it disappear exactly?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, at turn t+1, life span is N-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n\nI think it's common that at the beginning of each turn, food with life span 0 is removed before the snake moves.\n\nBut to be precise: \"disappears after N turns\" and countdown decreases including current turn.\n\nAssume that at turn t, if food has life span L, then after turn t is processed, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0, it disappears before turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, if L > 0, it remains.\n\nFor food at (4,3) at turn 18, life span 5: after turn 18, life span 4; after turn 19, life span 3; ... after turn 22, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life span 8: disappears before turn 26.\n\nNow, current turn t=18.\n\nHead at (5,1), moving left, so from (5,1), possible moves: U (up to (5,2)), D (down, but y=1, down would be y=0, which is wall, so not possible), L (left to (4,1)), R (right to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by body, so collision if I go there).\n\nLet's list possible moves from (5,1):\n\n- U: to (5,2) — but (5,2) is occupied by the snake body, position (5,2) is in the list, it's the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2) tail.\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied by the 5th segment (index 5). So if I move up to (5,2), it's a body collision, death.\n\n- D: to (5,0) — but y=0 is wall, so wall collision, death.\n\n- L: to (4,1) — what is (4,1)? Let's see if it's free.\n\nCurrent positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). So (4,1) is not occupied by snake. Also, is it wall? Walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, and internal (3,1). (4,1) is not listed as wall, so it should be free.\n\nx=4, y=1, not border, not (3,1), so free.\n\n- R: to (6,1) — but (6,1) is occupied by body segment, so collision.\n\nAlso, cannot instant reverse: head direction is L, so moving R would be opposite, but R is right, which is opposite to left, so I cannot move right because of no instant reverse rule.\n\nHead direction is L, meaning it moved left to get here, so next move cannot be right.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,2) — occupied, death\n\n- D: to (5,0) — wall, death\n\n- L: to (4,1) — free\n\n- R: to (6,1) — occupied and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move without immediate death is L to (4,1).\n\nIs that right? U to (5,2) is occupied, yes.\n\nBut (5,2) is part of the body, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, D to wall, death.\n\nR not allowed and occupied.\n\nL to (4,1) is free, as per positions.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,2), which is below (4,1)? (4,1) and (4,2) are different cells.\n\n(4,1) is not occupied, so moving to (4,1) should be safe.\n\nThen, after moving, the snake will have new head at (4,1), and body segments shift: the tail (4,2) will be removed, but since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nWhen snake moves to a new cell without food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo after moving left to (4,1):\n\nNew positions: head at (4,1)\n\nThen body: (5,1) [previous head], (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2) — and (4,2) is no longer part of snake? Tail was (4,2), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new tail is (5,2)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: indices: 0: (5,1), 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2)\n\nAfter move to (4,1): new head at (4,1)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to where seg1 was, (6,1)\n\nSegment 3 to where seg2 was, (6,2)\n\nSegment 4 to where seg3 was, (6,3)\n\nSegment 5 to where seg4 was, (5,3)\n\nSegment 6 to where seg5 was, (5,2)\n\nBut segment 6 was tail at (4,2), but it moves to (5,2), which was occupied by segment 5? No.\n\nWhen moving, the body segments shift: the first body segment (index 1) moves to the old head position (5,1)\n\nIndex 2 moves to old position of index 1, which is (6,1)\n\nIndex 3 to old index 2, (6,2)\n\nIndex 4 to old index 3, (6,3)\n\nIndex 5 to old index 4, (5,3)\n\nIndex 6 to old index 5, (5,2)\n\nAnd old index 6 position (4,2) is vacated.\n\nNow, (5,2) was occupied by index 5, but index 6 moves to (5,2), which is fine, it's the same cell, but after move, index 5 is at (5,3), and index 6 moves to (5,2).\n\nNew positions: head: (4,1)\n\nBody: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nTail at (5,2)\n\nPreviously tail was (4,2), now it's (5,2).\n\nAnd (4,2) is free.\n\nNow, food at (4,3) and (4,4) are still there.\n\nBut at turn 18, moving to (4,1), no food there.\n\nNow, head direction: after moving left, new head direction is L.\n\nBut for next move, I need to choose direction.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 18, I must move to (4,1) because it's the only safe move.\n\nIs that true? Earlier I thought only L is possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: walls at borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal wall at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nSo available cells around (5,1):\n\n- North: (5,2) - occupied by snake (index 5)\n\n- South: (5,0) - wall, y=0\n\n- West: (4,1) - free? No snake, no wall? x=4,y=1, not border, not (3,1), so free.\n\n- East: (6,1) - occupied by snake (index 1)\n\nAlso, no instant reverse, so cannot go east (right) because head came from right, moving left.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is west to (4,1).\n\nSo for turn 18, action must be L.\n\nNow, after moving, at turn 19, head at (4,1), head direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, from (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) — what is (4,2)? Previously it was tail, but after move, it was vacated. At turn 19, positions are: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is free? From above, after turn 18 move, positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n\n- D: to (4,0) - wall, y=0, death\n\n- L: to (3,1) - but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so death\n\n- R: to (5,1) - but (5,1) is occupied by body (first segment), so collision. Also, moving right would be opposite to current direction left, so no instant reverse, cannot move right.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so moving R is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) - free\n\n- D: wall, death\n\n- L: wall, death\n\n- R: not allowed and occupied\n\nSo only possible move is U to (4,2).\n\nIs (4,2) free? Yes, as per above positions.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), if no food, but is there food?\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,4), not at (4,2).\n\n(4,2) had food before? No, food is only at (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nSo moving to (4,2) no food eaten.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,2)\n\nBody: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail at (5,3)? Previous positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nAfter move up to (4,2): new head (4,2)\n\nThen body: old head position (4,1) -> first body segment\n\nThen (5,1) -> second\n\n(6,1) -> third\n\n(6,2) -> fourth\n\n(6,3) -> fifth\n\n(5,3) -> sixth\n\nAnd (5,2) was tail, vacated.\n\nNew tail is (5,3)\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail at (5,3)\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nFood: (4,3) and (4,4) still present.\n\nNow at turn 19, we moved to (4,2).\n\nTurn 20: head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,3) — but (4,3) has food? Yes, food at (4,3), value 1, positive.\n\nBut (4,3) is a cell, is it occupied? Currently, snake positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(4,3) is not occupied, so moving to (4,3) would eat the food, since it's free.\n\n- D: to (4,1) — but (4,1) is occupied by body (first segment), so collision, death. Also, moving down would be opposite to current up direction? Current direction U, so down is opposite, no instant reverse, cannot move down.\n\n- L: to (3,2) — what is (3,2)? Not wall, not occupied? Walls: borders and (3,1), (3,2) is not wall. Occupied? Snake positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), etc., no (3,2), so free.\n\n- R: to (5,2) — but (5,2) is not occupied now? After previous move, positions are (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), so (5,2) is free? Last position is (5,3), not (5,2). (5,2) was vacated earlier. So (5,2) should be free.\n\nConfirm: after turn 19 move to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So cells: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So (5,2) is not occupied, free. Similarly, (3,2) free, etc.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3): free, has food\n\n- D to (4,1): occupied by body, and also reverse direction not allowed (since moving down when heading up)\n\n- L to (3,2): free\n\n- R to (5,2): free\n\nNow, if I move U to (4,3), I eat the food there, value +1, snake grows, so tail not removed, new segment added.\n\nIf I move L or R, no food eaten.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,3), head at (4,2). Are they adjacent? (4,2) and (5,3) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,2) neighbors: (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2). (5,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nIf I eat food at (4,3), head moves to (4,3), since food eaten, new head at (4,3), and tail stays, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the head? Standard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: after eating, head at (4,3), the body includes the previous head and all segments, so new positions: head (4,3), then previous head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and since food eaten, a new segment is added where the tail was, but tail was (5,3), so new tail at (5,3)? No.\n\nTypically, when food eaten, the tail does not move, so the snake grows.\n\nSo before move, positions: P = [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] head at (4,2)\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) with food: new head at (4,3), then the body is the previous positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) remains as the last segment, so tail at (5,3), but now there is an extra segment.\n\nPrevious positions had 7 segments: indices 0 to 6.\n\nAfter move without food, head moves to new cell, tail removed, so 7 segments.\n\nBut with food, head moves to new cell, tail not removed, so 8 segments.\n\nSo new positions: head at (4,3), then body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — same as before but head at (4,3) and tail at (5,3) still.\n\nThe segments are: the new head is (4,3), then the previous head (4,2) becomes first body, then (4,1), (5,1), etc., up to (5,3), and since food eaten, no removal, so tail is still (5,3), but now it's part of the body, and a new segment is not added; the snake just keeps the tail.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place for that turn, so the length increases by one. So the tail position does not change immediately; it stays, and a new segment is effectively added.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head at new position (4,3), then all previous positions remain, so [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] with head (4,3) and tail (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is still there, but now it's the tail.\n\nBefore, tail was (5,3), after growth, tail is still (5,3), but the snake has one more segment.\n\nIn the list, it's appended or something.\n\nFrom the state, positions include all segments.\n\nBefore move: 7 segments.\n\nAfter move with food: 8 segments: new head + all previous segments.\n\nSo new positions: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nHead direction U.\n\nNow, back to turn 20 choices.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), I eat food, grow to 8 segments.\n\nThen I have to move from there.\n\nIf I move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2), no food, then snake moves, tail removed.\n\nBut let's think about the food life span.\n\nFood at (4,3) has life span 5 at turn 18. At turn 19, after turn 18, life span decreases to 4? Let's track.\n\nTurn 18: food (4,3) life span 5\n\nAfter turn 18 processed, life span decreases to 4.\n\nTurn 19: food (4,3) life span 4\n\nAfter turn 19, decreases to 3.\n\nTurn 20: life span 3, so if I move to (4,3) on turn 20, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life span 8 at turn 18, at turn 20 it's 6.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,3) now, it might disappear soon.\n\nLife span at turn 20 is 3, so after turn 20, it becomes 2, then turn 21:1, turn 22:0, disappear before turn 23.\n\nSo I have until turn 22 to eat it, but since it decreases each turn, at turn 20, life span 3, meaning after this turn it will be 2, etc.\n\nIf I move to it on turn 20, I can eat it.\n\nIf I don't, it might be risky.\n\nBut at turn 20, from (4,2), I can go U to eat (4,3), or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I go U, I eat and grow.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,4): has food, but (4,4) has another food, value 1.\n\n- D to (4,2): but (4,2) is now occupied by body? After eating, positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), etc. So (4,2) is first body segment, so moving down to (4,2) would be collision, and also reverse direction not allowed (since moving down when heading up).\n\n- L to (3,3): free? What is (3,3)? Not wall, not occupied.\n\n- R to (5,3): but (5,3) is tail, currently at (5,3). After eating, tail is at (5,3), but when I move, if no food, tail moves, but here (5,3) is occupied.\n\nAt (4,3), neighbors:\n\n- U (4,4): free? Not occupied, has food.\n\n- D (4,2): occupied by body, and reverse.\n\n- L (3,3): not occupied, no wall.\n\n- R (5,3): occupied by tail (5,3), but since it's the tail, and snake moves, if I move to (5,3), and it's the tail, it might be ok because the tail will move, but in this case, since I just ate food, tail is not moving this turn? Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut when I eat food, the tail does not move; it stays, so if I move to the tail cell, it might collide.\n\nThe rule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nThis assumes that the tail is moving, i.e., no food eaten. But if food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so moving to tail cell would cause collision because the tail stays.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (4,3), tail is at (5,3) and it doesn't move if no further food, but when I move from (4,3), if I go to (5,3), and (5,3) is occupied by tail, but since tail will move only if no food eaten in this move.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt the start of turn, if head moves to a cell with food, food eaten, tail not removed, snake grows.\n\nIf no food, tail removed.\n\nWhen moving to tail cell: if no food is eaten in that move, tail moves away, so head can occupy it safely.\n\nIf food is eaten in that move, tail doesn't move, so head moving to tail cell would collide.\n\nIn this case, from (4,3), if I move to (5,3), and (5,3) has no food, so if I move there, no food eaten, so tail would move away, so it should be safe.\n\n(5,3) does not have food; food is at (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nSo moving to (5,3) has no food.\n\nSo from (4,3), moving to (5,3):\n\n- If I move to (5,3), no food there, so no food eaten, so the tail at (5,3) will move away (to where it was supposed to go), so head can occupy (5,3) safely.\n\nSimilarly, in general, moving to tail cell is safe only if no food is eaten in that move, so that tail moves.\n\nBut if the cell has food, it's different.\n\nHere, (5,3) has no food, so moving to it should be ok.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — tail at (5,3).\n\nNow, from here, if I move to (5,3), and (5,3) is the tail.\n\nSince no food at (5,3), so when I move to (5,3), food not eaten, so the snake moves: head to (5,3), which is the old tail position.\n\nThen the body: first body segment moves to old head position (4,3), but (4,3) is now occupied? No.\n\nNew head at (5,3)\n\nThen the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,3)\n\nThen second to where first body was, (4,2)\n\nThen (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nAnd the tail (5,3) is vacated because head moved there, but since no food, tail is removed, so the last segment (6,3) is removed? Positions: after move, head at (5,3), then body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail at (6,3)? Let's index.\n\nPrevious positions after eating: S0: (4,3) head, S1: (4,2), S2: (4,1), S3: (5,1), S4: (6,1), S5: (6,2), S6: (6,3), S7: (5,3) tail? 8 segments.\n\nS0 head (4,3), S1 (4,2), S2 (4,1), S3 (5,1), S4 (6,1), S5 (6,2), S6 (6,3), S7 (5,3) tail.\n\nNow move head to (5,3). Since (5,3) has no food, no growth.\n\nNew head at (5,3)\n\nThen S1 moves to old S0 position (4,3)\n\nS2 moves to old S1 position (4,2)\n\nS3 to old S2 (4,1)\n\nS4 to old S3 (5,1)\n\nS5 to old S4 (6,1)\n\nS6 to old S5 (6,2)\n\nS7 to old S6 (6,3)\n\nAnd old S7 position (5,3) is now head, so tail was S7 at (5,3), but it moves to (6,3), so (5,3) is head, and (6,3) is new tail.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if the cell was not tail, it would be different.\n\nBack to point.\n\nAt turn 20, from (4,2), if I move U to (4,3), I eat food, grow to 8.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) to eat another food, or L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), I eat (4,4), grow to 9.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4), R to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider other options.\n\nAt turn 20, from (4,2), if I don't go U, I can go L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I go L to (3,2), no food, then new head (3,2), direction L? Moved left, so direction L.\n\nPositions: after move to (3,2), head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail at (5,3)? Previous: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nAfter move L to (3,2) no food: new head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) removed? No food, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then body: old head (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail at (6,3)? S0 head (3,2), S1 (4,2), S2 (4,1), S3 (5,1), S4 (6,1), S5 (6,2), S6 (6,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) removed.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to access the food later, but (4,3) is at (4,3), which is adjacent to (4,2) but (4,2) is now body, so I can't move directly.\n\n(4,3) is north of (4,2), but (4,2) is now occupied.\n\nTo eat (4,3), I need to be at (4,2) or (3,3) or (5,3) or (4,4), but (4,2) is occupied, so from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3), then to (4,3) or something.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (5,2) at turn 20.\n\nBut let's think about long-term.\n\nAlso, there's the food at (4,4) with longer life span.\n\nBut (4,3) will disappear soon if not eaten.\n\nAt turn 20, life span of (4,3) is 3, so I can eat it on turn 20,21, or 22.\n\nIf I eat it on turn 20, from (4,2) directly.\n\nIf I don't, I might miss it or have risk.\n\nBut let's see the board state.\n\nAfter turn 18 and 19, we are at turn 20 with head at (4,2), and only one safe move at turn 18 and 19.\n\nAt turn 18: must go L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 19: must go U to (4,2)\n\nAt turn 20, I have choices: U to (4,3) to eat food, or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2)\n\nIf I go U, I eat (4,3), grow, then at (4,3), I can go U to (4,4) to eat another food immediately, since (4,4) is free.\n\nThen I get two foods quickly.\n\nIf I go L or R, I might not get (4,3) or it might be risky.\n\nFor example, if I go L to (3,2) at turn 20, then at turn 21, from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3), then at turn 22, from (3,3) I can go R to (4,3) to eat food, but life span: at turn 20, (4,3) life span 3, after turn 20, it becomes 2, turn 21:1, turn 22:0, so at turn 22, if I move to it, life span might be 0 or 1?\n\nAt start of turn 22, if life span 1, I can eat it, then after turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nBut if I move to it on turn 22, it should be eaten if life span >0.\n\nSimilarly, turn 21 or 20.\n\nBut at turn 22, from (3,3), I can go to (4,3), but (4,3) might be accessible.\n\nBut there's a risk that the snake body might block.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to avoid colliding.\n\nBut in the short term, eating both foods might be good.\n\nBut let's think about Tail Reward Danger.\n\nWhen I eat (4,3), tail is at (5,3), head at (4,3), not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nThen if I eat (4,4), head to (4,4), tail at (5,3), not adjacent.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move U, L, or R.\n\nD is to (4,3) which is body, collision.\n\nU to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nAll might be free.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nThe snake is currently in a bit of a loop or something.\n\nCurrent positions: after turn 19, head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nThe area around (4,3) is tight.\n\nIf I eat (4,3) and then (4,4), I grow to 9 segments, and the body is around (4,1) to (6,3), so I might get stuck.\n\nFor example, after eating both, positions would be: after eating (4,3) at turn 20: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nThen eat (4,4) at turn 21: move U to (4,4), food eaten, new head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — 9 segments, tail at (5,3)\n\nNow from (4,4), I can go U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nSay I go U to (4,5), then I am at (4,5), and so on.\n\nThe board has walls, and internal obstacle at (3,1), so not much space.\n\nGrid is 6x6, snake length 9, which is long for 36 cells, but not full.\n\nAvailable cells: total cells 6x6=36, snake 7, so 29 free, but after eating two, 9, 27 free, still space.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat both immediately to have more space.\n\nBut the food will disappear, (4,3) soon.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,3) is under the body? No, currently at turn 20, (4,3) is free, not under body.\n\nBut earlier, it might have been under, but not now.\n\nIn the initial state, at turn 18, snake positions include (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), but (4,3) is not occupied, it's food.\n\nSo not under body.\n\nNow, back to turn 20 decision.\n\nIf I eat (4,3) at turn 20, I grow, then I can choose to eat (4,4) or not.\n\nIf I eat (4,4), I grow more.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,3) at turn 20, I might lose it.\n\nFor example, if I go R to (5,2) at turn 20.\n\nFrom (4,2), go R to (5,2), no food.\n\nNew head (5,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPositions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail at (5,3)? Previous: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nAfter move R to (5,2) no food: new head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) removed? No, tail was (5,3), removed, so new positions: head (5,2), S1 (4,2), S2 (4,1), S3 (5,1), S4 (6,1), S5 (6,2), S6 (6,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) removed.\n\nNow from (5,2), I can go U to (5,3), but (5,3) is free now, or D to (5,1) occupied, etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is free, and I can go there.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go L to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nSimilarly, life span: at turn 20, (4,3) life span 3, so I can eat on turn 21.\n\nIf at turn 20 I go to (5,2), then turn 21 go U to (5,3), no food, then turn 22 go L to (4,3) to eat.\n\nOr from (5,2) at turn 20, I can go directly to (4,3)? From (5,2), neighbors: U (5,3), D (5,1) occupied, L (4,2) occupied, R (6,2) occupied.\n\n(4,2) is S1, occupied, (6,2) is S5, occupied, (5,1) S3 occupied, so only possible move from (5,2) is U to (5,3), which is free.\n\nThen at turn 21, head at (5,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), L to (4,3), R to (6,3), D to (5,2) occupied.\n\nL to (4,3) has food, R to (6,3) is occupied? S6 is (6,3), tail, but moving to tail cell is safe if no food.\n\n(6,3) is tail, so I can move to (6,3) safely.\n\nU to (5,4) free.\n\nSo choices: U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go L to (4,3), I eat the food at turn 21.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U or R, I might not eat it.\n\nBut life span: at turn 21, (4,3) life span 2 (after turn 20 decrease), so I can eat on turn 21 or 22.\n\nIf I eat at turn 21, fine.\n\nBut in this path, I didn't eat at turn 20, so I have a chance later.\n\nBut eating later means the snake is shorter longer, which might be better for maneuverability.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating is good, but survival first.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,4) is there with life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead from turn 18.\n\nFirst, from turn 18, only one move: L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 19: only U to (4,2)\n\nNow at turn 20, I have three choices: U to (4,3), L to (3,2), or R to (5,2)\n\nIf I go U to (4,3), eat food, then at turn 21 from (4,3) I can go U to (4,4) to eat another, or L to (3,3), or R to (5,3)\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), eat, then at turn 22 from (4,4) I can go U to (4,5), L to (3,4), or R to (5,4)\n\nAll free, say U to (4,5), then continue.\n\nBut snake is long.\n\nIf at turn 21 from (4,3) I go L to (3,3), no food, then from (3,3) I can go to other places.\n\nBut I might not get the second food.\n\nSince both foods are positive, eating both is good for score.\n\nBut let's consider not eating at turn 20.\n\nSuppose at turn 20, I go L to (3,2)\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction L\n\nFrom there, at turn 21, possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, so death, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) occupied.\n\nR to (4,2) is occupied by body, S1 (4,2)\n\nL to (2,2) free, U to (3,3) free.\n\nD wall.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nSay go U to (3,3), no food.\n\nThen at turn 22, head at (3,3), direction U\n\nFrom (3,3), can go U to (3,4), D to (3,2) occupied, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) has food.\n\nR to (4,3) to eat food, since life span at turn 22: originally life span 5 at turn 18, after turn 18:4, turn19:3, turn20:2, turn21:1, turn22:0? At start of turn 22, life span is 1? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 18: life span 5\n\nAfter turn 18 processed: life span 4\n\nTurn 19: life span 4, after turn 19:3\n\nTurn 20: life span 3, after turn 20:2\n\nTurn 21: life span 2, after turn 21:1\n\nTurn 22: life span 1, so at turn 22, if I move to (4,3), I can eat it before it disappears. After turn 22, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 22, from (3,3), I can go R to (4,3) to eat.\n\nThen I get the food.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone other ways.\n\nBut in this case, I ate later, snake was shorter for two more turns.\n\nBut I still got the food.\n\nThe second food at (4,4) is still there.\n\nNow, the Tail Reward Danger: when I eat (4,3), where is the tail?\n\nAt turn 22, if I eat from (3,3) to (4,3), tail position depends.\n\nLet's trace.\n\nAt turn 20: if I went L to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail? After move to (3,2) no food: new head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail.\n\nTurn 21: go U to (3,3), no food, new head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail at (6,3)? S0 head (3,3), S1 (3,2), S2 (4,2), S3 (4,1), S4 (5,1), S5 (6,1), S6 (6,2), and (6,3) removed, so tail at (6,2)\n\nPositions: head (3,3), S1 (3,2), S2 (4,2), S3 (4,1), S4 (5,1), S5 (6,1), S6 (6,2) tail.\n\nTurn 22: move R to (4,3), eat food.\n\n(4,3) has food, so eaten.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then body (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) and since food eaten, no removal, so tail at (6,2)? 8 segments.\n\nHead (4,3), S1 (3,3), S2 (3,2), S3 (4,2), S4 (4,1), S5 (5,1), S6 (6,1), S7 (6,2) tail.\n\nTail at (6,2), head at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\nNo danger.\n\nThen I can go to (4,4) later.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 20 I go R to (5,2), similar thing.\n\nBut going to (5,2) then to (5,3) then to (4,3) to eat at turn 21 or 22.\n\nAt turn 20 go R to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail.\n\nTurn 21: from (5,2) only U to (5,3), no food, new head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail at (6,3)? S0 (5,3), S1 (5,2), S2 (4,2), S3 (4,1), S4 (5,1), S5 (6,1), S6 (6,2), (6,3) removed, tail at (6,2)\n\nThen at turn 22, from (5,3) I can go L to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nHead at (5,3), go L to (4,3), eat.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) and no removal, tail at (6,2)? 8 segments.\n\nTail at (6,2), head at (4,3), fine.\n\nSo in all cases, I can eat (4,3) by turn 22.\n\nBut if I eat at turn 20, I get the point earlier, and I can eat (4,4) sooner.\n\nSince both are +1, same value, but eating sooner might be better, but not necessary for score, as long as I eat before disappearance.\n\nBut for survival, having a shorter snake might be better to avoid traps.\n\nBut here, the grid has space.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (3,1), so bottom row has a wall.\n\nBut I think eating both foods is possible.\n\nBut let's see if there's a risk with the tail.\n\nFor example, when I eat (4,3), if the tail is close, but in all cases, tail is not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nBut there is a special case: Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, when I eat (4,3), tail is not at (4,3), and not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both foods, but I need to do it safely.\n\nAlso, think about the future.\n\nPerhaps after eating, I can explore the board.\n\nBut since no other food mentioned, only these two, so after eating them, I need to survive and find more food, but the state only shows current food, I think more may spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe state gives current food, and I need to work with that.\n\nBut for long-term, I should keep the snake in a position where it can move freely.\n\nCurrently, the snake is in the bottom-left area.\n\nIf I eat both foods, I am at (4,4) with length 9, then I can move up to (4,5), etc.\n\nIf I don't eat one, I have less length.\n\nBut since food is limited, eating both is better for score.\n\nBut survival first, so if I can eat both, do it.\n\nAt turn 20, if I go U to (4,3), eat, then at turn 21, I can go U to (4,4) to eat immediately, or go elsewhere.\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), eat, then at turn 22 at (4,4), I can go U to (4,5), etc.\n\nIf at turn 21 from (4,3) I go L to (3,3), then I can eat (4,4) later, but it might be blocked or something.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) go L to (3,3), no food, then from (3,3) I can go to (3,4) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,4) is still there.\n\nLife span of (4,4) is 8 at turn 18, so at turn 22, life span 8-4=4, plenty of time.\n\nSo no rush.\n\nBut to save turns, eating both quickly is fine.\n\nI think the safest is to eat (4,3) at turn 20, then at turn 21 eat (4,4), then move away.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: must be L\n\nTurn 19: must be U\n\nTurn 20: I choose U to eat (4,3)\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,3) I can go U to eat (4,4)\n\nThen turn 22: from (4,4) go U to (4,5), for example.\n\nBut I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output for several turns, starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... }\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should output for 5 turns or more.\n\nCurrent turn t1=18, so output for turn 18,19,20,21,22, for example.\n\nAt turn 18: L\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U (to eat (4,3))\n\nTurn 21: U (to eat (4,4))\n\nThen at turn 22, from (4,4), after eating (4,4) at turn 21, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nSay go U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 23 from (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to choose.\n\nSince the grid is open, moving up is fine.\n\nTo be specific.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the moves.\n\nBut at turn 21, from (4,3), if I go U to (4,4), I eat, but is there any risk?\n\nHead at (4,3), go U to (4,4), food at (4,4), so eat, grow.\n\nTail at that time: after eating (4,3) at turn 20, positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nThen move U to (4,4), food eaten, new head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nTail at (5,3), head at (4,4), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nThen from (4,4), go U to (4,5) at turn 22.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIf I want to avoid growing too fast, I could not eat (4,4) immediately, but since it's positive, I should eat it.\n\nFor example, at turn 21 from (4,3) go L to (3,3), then later eat (4,4), but I might not need to.\n\nI think eating both is fine.\n\nSo for the plan:\n\nTurn 18: L (only choice)\n\nTurn 19: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 20: U (to (4,3), eat food)\n\nTurn 21: U (to (4,4), eat food)\n\nThen for turn 22, from (4,4), after eating, head at (4,4), direction U, so I can go U to (4,5)\n\nSimilarly, turn 23: from (4,5) can go U to (4,6) or L/R, but y=6 is top, (4,6), U would be (4,7) wall, so at (4,5), U to (4,6), but (4,6) is border? Walls y=7, so y=6 is playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok.\n\nGrid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since walls x=0,7 y=0,7.\n\nSo (4,6) is top row, free.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6), can go L or R, say L to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify too far, but for 5 turns, from turn 18 to 22.\n\nt1=18, so turns 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nAt turn 22, from (4,4) to (4,5), as above.\n\nAfter turn 21: head at (4,4)\n\nThen turn 22 move to (4,5), no food there, so no growth, positions shift.\n\nBut since I output actions, I can do that.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial moves, turn 18 and 19 are forced, turn 20 I choose U, but I could choose L or R to delay eating, but I think U is fine.\n\nPerhaps to have more space, but I think it's ok.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nThe current state (turn 18) requires careful planning to maximize score by eating both positive foods while ensuring long-term survival. The snake must avoid collisions with walls, its body, and internal obstacles. The head is at (5,1) moving left, with only one safe move at turn 18 (left to (4,1)) and turn 19 (up to (4,2)). At turn 20, the snake can reach the food at (4,3) by moving up, eating it to grow. Then, at turn 21, moving up again to (4,4) eats the second food. Both foods are positive (+1 each) and must be eaten before they disappear: (4,3) disappears after turn 22 (life span 5 at turn 18, decreases to 0 after turn 22), and (4,4) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 25). Eating both quickly maximizes score and is safe, as the tail is not adjacent during consumption, avoiding Tail Reward Danger.\n\nAfter eating, the snake should move upward to open space (e.g., to (4,5) and (4,6)) to avoid dead ends. The grid is 6x6 (playable area x=1-6, y=1-6), and with the snake growing to 9 segments after eating both foods, there is sufficient space for maneuver (27 free cells). Internal obstacle (3,1) and borders must be avoided.\n\n**Key Risks and Mitigation:**\n- **Turn 18 and 19:** Only one safe move each (left then up).\n- **Turn 20:** Moving up to (4,3) eats food; no collision risk.\n- **Turn 21:** Moving up to (4,4) eats food; tail at (5,3) is not adjacent to head at (4,4), so safe.\n- **Future turns (22+):** Move to open areas (e.g., (4,5)) to prevent trapping. No food is available after (4,4), so survival is prioritized by exploring safely.\n- **Life Span Tracking:** \n  - (4,3): Life span 5 at turn 18 → 4 after turn 18 → 3 at turn 19 → 2 after turn 19 → 1 at turn 20 → eaten at turn 20 (safe, life span 1).\n  - (4,4): Life span 8 at turn 18 → eaten at turn 21 (plenty of time).\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 18-22):**\n- **Turn 18 (t1=18):** Move left (L) to (4,1) – only safe move.\n- **Turn 19 (t1+1=19):** Move up (U) to (4,2) – only safe move.\n- **Turn 20 (t1+2=20):** Move up (U) to (4,3) – eat food (+1, grow to 8 segments).\n- **Turn 21 (t1+3=21):** Move up (U) to (4,4) – eat food (+1, grow to 9 segments).\n- **Turn 22 (t1+4=22):** Move up (U) to (4,5) – no food, safe move to open area.\n\nThis plan eats both foods by turn 21, maximizing immediate score, and moves to (4,5) at turn 22 for future exploration. Beyond turn 22, the snake should continue upward or sideways (e.g., to (3,5) or (5,5)) to avoid walls and seek new food, but this is beyond the 5-turn scope.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: L  \nTurn 19: U  \nTurn 20: U  \nTurn 21: U  \nTurn 22: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the edges and that one obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,1), then body segments: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 4: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,3)\n\n- Tail: (5,2)\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So, the snake was moving left to reach (4,1) from (5,1), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n1. (4,3) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n\n2. (4,4) with life span 7, value +1\n\n3. (1,6) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Score comes from eating positive food, which increases length by 1. But I must avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, or body, except that moving into the tail is okay if the tail moves away.\n\nSpecial case: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and causes collision. But in this case, the tail is at (5,2), and it doesn't have food; food is elsewhere.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (4,1) head\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,2) tail\n\nSo, the snake body forms a sort of shape. From (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,2). So it's like a path that goes right, then up, then left.\n\nHead at (4,1) facing left. So from (5,1) it moved left to (4,1).\n\nPossible moves from head position (4,1): since direction is L (left), I can move L, U, or D, but not R because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. From (4,1), possible actions:\n\n- L (left): to (3,1)\n\n- U (up): to (4,2)\n\n- D (down): to (4,0)\n\nBut (4,0) is y=0, which is a wall, so I can't go down. y=0 is a border wall.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) has an internal obstacle? Obstacle is at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is wall, can't go there.\n\nSo from (4,1), with head direction L:\n\n- Left: to (3,1) — but (3,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\n- Up: to (4,2) — is this free? Let's see what's at (4,2).\n\nSnake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2). (5,2) is tail, (4,2) is not listed, so it should be empty? Let's list all occupied cells:\n\n- (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\n(4,2) is not occupied, so it should be free.\n\n- Down: to (4,0) — but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: but direction is L, and right is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. So I can't go right to (5,1), which is the body anyway.\n\n(5,1) is a body segment, so even if I could go right, it would be collision, but since it's not allowed due to reverse, it's doubly invalid.\n\nSo from (4,1), only possible move is Up to (4,2).\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: not opposite, so not R. L, U, D.\n\nL to (3,1): obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (4,0): wall, invalid.\n\nU to (4,2): not wall, not obstacle, and not occupied? Is (4,2) occupied?\n\nSnake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2). (5,2) is at (5,2), not (4,2). (4,2) is not listed, so it's empty. Also, no food there, I think.\n\nFood is at (4,3), (4,4), (1,6), not at (4,2).\n\nSo U to (4,2) should be safe and possible.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn is 19, so I need to output actions for turn 19, 20, 21, etc., at least 5 turns, but since the game continues, I should plan as far as I can, but output for several turns.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify actions starting from turn 19.\n\nFirst, for turn 19, from (4,1), only possible move is Up to (4,2). Is that correct?\n\nDirection is L, and I'm moving U, which is not opposite, so yes.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), the snake will be: new head at (4,2), then the body: since we move, the tail will move away? When the head moves, the body follows, so the segment that was at (4,1) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if head moves from (4,1) to (4,2), new positions:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,1)  // previous head position\n\n- Segment 2: (5,1)  // previous segment 1 position\n\n- Segment 3: (6,1)  // previous segment 2\n\n- Segment 4: (6,2)  // previous segment 3\n\n- Segment 5: (6,3)  // previous segment 4\n\n- Segment 6: (5,3)  // previous segment 5\n\nTail was (5,2), but now the tail is the last segment, which was (5,2), but since we moved, the tail moves to where the second last was? Let's list the positions before move:\n\nIndex: 0: head (4,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: tail (5,2)\n\nAfter move up to (4,2):\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- New pos 1: old head (4,1)\n\n- New pos 2: old pos 1 (5,1)\n\n- New pos 3: old pos 2 (6,1)\n\n- New pos 4: old pos 3 (6,2)\n\n- New pos 5: old pos 4 (6,3)\n\n- New pos 6: old pos 5 (5,3)  // this is the new tail\n\nThe tail was old pos 6 (5,2), which is no longer part of snake; it moved away.\n\nNew snake: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nNow, head direction is now U (up), since I moved up.\n\nBut for next moves, the direction is based on the movement, not stored, I think. The state gives current head direction, but after move, I need to update it.\n\nIn the input, it says \"Snake Head Direction\" for the current state.\n\nAfter moving, the new direction will be the move I made.\n\nFor turn 19, action: U.\n\nThen for turn 20, head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nNow, I need to plan ahead.\n\nFood: (4,3) with life span 4. Current turn 19, so after this move, on turn 20, life span decreases to 3.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life 7 to 6, (1,6) life 10 to 9.\n\n(4,3) is just above (4,2), so if I go up again to (4,3), I can eat the food, since it's positive.\n\nBut is that safe?\n\nFirst, from (4,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R (not D, since down would be opposite to current U).\n\nCurrent direction U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U (up to (4,3)), L (left to (3,2)), R (right to (5,2)).\n\nNow, what is at these cells?\n\n(4,3): has food, and it's not occupied by snake? Current snake positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So (4,3) is not occupied, has food.\n\n(3,2): is this free? x=3,y=2. Walls: borders are walls, internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,2) should be free, no snake or obstacle mentioned.\n\n(5,2): what is here? (5,2) was tail in previous state, but now after move, the snake has (5,3) and others, (5,2) is not occupied now? After turn 19 move, snake is at (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So (5,2) is empty? And no food there.\n\n(5,2) was tail position, but we moved, so it's free now.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) should be free.\n\nBut let's check for walls or obstacles.\n\nWalls: x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,1). So (3,2) is not a wall, should be accessible.\n\n(5,2) is not wall.\n\nNow, if I move U to (4,3), I eat the food, so length increases by 1, score +1.\n\nWhen I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nIf I move to (4,3) on turn 20, head to (4,3), which has food, so I eat it, and the snake grows. New head at (4,3), and tail stays where it was, so the segment that was tail (5,3) remains, and a new segment is added, but since we don't move the tail, the positions: after move, head to (4,3), then body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so tail becomes (5,3), but (5,3) is already there? Let's see.\n\nBefore move on turn 20: snake positions: let's say after turn 19 move: S = [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nHead at (4,2).\n\nMove U to (4,3): new head (4,3)\n\nSince (4,3) has food, we eat it, so the tail does not move; instead, we add a new segment at the current tail position.\n\nCurrent tail is (5,3). So after move, the body moves: segment 1 to (4,2), segment 2 to (4,1), ..., segment 6 to (6,3) (which was segment 5 before? Positions: indices.\n\nLet the positions be P[0] = head (4,2), P[1] = (4,1), P[2] = (5,1), P[3] = (6,1), P[4] = (6,2), P[5] = (6,3), P[6] = tail (5,3)\n\nAfter move to (4,3):\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nThen new P[1] = old P[0] = (4,2)\n\nNew P[2] = old P[1] = (4,1)\n\nNew P[3] = old P[2] = (5,1)\n\nNew P[4] = old P[3] = (6,1)\n\nNew P[5] = old P[4] = (6,2)\n\nNew P[6] = old P[5] = (6,3)  // this would be the tail if no growth\n\nBut since we eat food, we add a new segment, so new tail is at old tail position, which is (5,3). So we have an additional segment at (5,3).\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the new positions are:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and then the tail remains at (5,3), so positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\n(5,3) is now the tail, and it's not moving during this step.\n\nNow, (4,3) was food, so it's eaten, disappears.\n\nNow, for safety: is there collision? Head at (4,3), body at (4,2), (4,1), etc. (4,2) is adjacent but not the same, so no collision.\n\nAlso, no walls.\n\nBut after this, the snake is longer, and we have other food.\n\nBut I need to think about the future.\n\nAnother option: from (4,2), I could go L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nBut if I go to (4,3) on turn 20, I eat the food, which is good, and it has life span 4, turn 19 now, after move to turn 20, life span decreases to 3, but I eat it, so it's fine.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, it might disappear later.\n\nBut let's see the life spans.\n\nCurrent turn 19: food at (4,3) life 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning on turn 20, life 3; turn 21, life 2; turn 22, life 1; turn 23, life 0, disappears. Since life span decreases each turn including current, but for eating, when I move to it, I eat it before it disappears.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears.\n\nAt the beginning of each turn, before action, the life span decreases, I think.\n\nThe rules say: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's like: when spawned, it has life span N. On each turn, including the turn it spawns, the life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before next turn.\n\nFor eating: if the head moves to a food cell on its turn, it eats it, regardless of life span, as long as it hasn't disappeared.\n\nIn this case, (4,3) at turn 19 has life 4. After turn 19 action, life decreases to 3 for turn 20.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut if I move to (4,3) on turn 20, I can eat it.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nFor turn 19, from (4,1), only possible move is U to (4,2), as we established.\n\nThen on turn 20, head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nNow from there, I can:\n\n- U to (4,3): eat food, grow\n\n- L to (3,2)\n\n- R to (5,2)\n\nIf I go U to (4,3), I eat and grow, as above.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nNow, from (4,3), possible moves: U, L, R (not D, opposite to U).\n\nU to (4,4): which has food! (4,4) has another food with life 7.\n\nSo if I go U to (4,4), I can eat that too.\n\nBut is that safe? Let's see the positions.\n\nAfter eating (4,3) on turn 20, snake is at [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] with head at (4,3).\n\nThen move U to (4,4): (4,4) has food, so eat it, grow.\n\nNew head (4,4), then body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and add new segment at tail (5,3), so positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nNow, is (4,4) safe? Yes, no collision.\n\nBut now the snake is long, and we need to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nAfter this, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nNow, possible moves: U, L, R (not D).\n\nU to (4,5): is this free? y=5, x=4. Walls: y=7 is wall, but y=5 is not border. No obstacle. Snake positions: currently occupied are the above, so (4,5) not occupied, should be free.\n\nL to (3,4): free?\n\nR to (5,4): free?\n\nBut if I go U to (4,5), that's fine, but I might want to go for other food or avoid issues.\n\nThere is food at (1,6), which is far, life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut after eating two foods, the snake is longer, and the grid has obstacles.\n\nNow, the problem: after being at (4,4), if I go U to (4,5), then I can go to (4,6), etc., but y=7 is wall, so I need to turn left or right at some point.\n\nBut let's see the current snake body: it's occupying the left and bottom area.\n\nSpecifically, from (4,4) down to (4,1), then to (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the right side is somewhat blocked.\n\n(5,3) is tail, but it's fixed when not moving tail.\n\nNow, if I keep going up, to (4,5), (4,6), then (4,7) is y=7, wall, so I can't go there. From (4,6), I need to turn left or right.\n\nBut left: (3,6), etc., or right (5,6).\n\nBut I need to think if there are risks.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat both foods immediately, to avoid growing too fast and trapping myself.\n\nBut the foods are positive, so eating is good, but I need to survive.\n\nAnother idea: from (4,2) on turn 20, instead of going up, I could go left or right to explore or avoid potential issues.\n\nBut (4,3) has short life, only 4 turns at start, turn 19, so after turn 19 action, on turn 20 it has life 3, then 2,1,0. If I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has life 7, longer.\n\n(1,6) has life 10, plenty.\n\nSo (4,3) is urgent.\n\nTherefore, I should eat (4,3) on turn 20.\n\nFor turn 19, I must go to (4,2), then turn 20 to (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 20, after eating, head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nNow, from there, I could go to (4,4) to eat that food, or go left or right.\n\nIf I go to (4,4), I eat it, grow, but then I'm at (4,4), which is near the top.\n\ny=4, top is y=7.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nNow, if I go R to (5,4), for example.\n\n(5,4) is free? Currently, after turn 20, snake is at [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] if I didn't go to (4,4), but if I go to (4,4) on turn 20, it's different.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nTurn 19: move from (4,1) to (4,2). After this, snake: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nFood: (4,3) life span: at turn 19 start, life 4; after turn 19 action, before turn 20, life decreases to 3? The countdown decreases every turn including current, but for eating, when we move.\n\nI think at the start of each turn, before action, the life span decreases.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate; (4,3) will be there until turn 22 or so, but to be safe, eat it on turn 20.\n\nSimilarly for turn 20 action.\n\nTurn 20: head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nAction: U to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nAfter move and eat, snake: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) since grown. Positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nNow turn 21: from (4,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is the tail! (5,3) is occupied by the tail.\n\nIf I move to (5,3), the head will be on the tail cell, but since the tail will move, is it safe?\n\nRules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo it should be okay, as long as after move, the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,3), which is the current tail position.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), new head at (5,3), but (5,3) was tail, so when I move there, since it's not food, the tail moves normally.\n\nIf I move to a cell that is the tail, and it's not food, then the head moves to tail position, and the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIf it had food, it might be dangerous, but here no food at (5,3).\n\nSo moving to (5,3) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has food, so if I go U to (4,4), I eat it.\n\n(3,3) should be free.\n\nNow, if I go U to (4,4), I eat the food, grow to length 9 or something.\n\nCurrent length: after eating (4,3), length is 8 segments? Original snake had 7 segments, ate one, so 8.\n\nPositions: 8 cells.\n\nThen if eat (4,4), grow to 9.\n\nThen head at (4,4).\n\nIf I go R to (5,4), for example.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nNot applicable here.\n\nAnother thing: after being at (4,3), if I go to (4,4), I eat, but then I'm at (4,4), and the snake body is below, so I might be boxing myself in.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), if I go U to (4,5), then to (4,6), then at (4,6), I can go to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, so must turn L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (3,6), then I can go left, but there is food at (1,6), so I can go towards it.\n\nBut with the snake body on the right, it might be okay.\n\nFrom (4,3), instead of going U to (4,4), I could go L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), to (5,3), which is the current tail.\n\nMove to (5,3): since no food, head moves to (5,3), body moves: new head (5,3), new body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — and the tail? Old tail was (5,3), but head moved there, so new positions: after move, new head (5,3), new P[1] = old head (4,3), P[2] = old P[1] (4,2), P[3] = old P[2] (4,1), P[4] = old P[3] (5,1), P[5] = old P[4] (6,1), P[6] = old P[5] (6,2), P[7] = old P[6] (6,3)  // old P[6] was (6,3), which was the last body, and tail moves to there.\n\nOld positions: indices 0: (4,3), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3) tail? Earlier I had 8 positions.\n\nAfter turn 20, snake: 8 positions: let's list:\n\n0: head (4,3)\n\n1: (4,2)\n\n2: (4,1)\n\n3: (5,1)\n\n4: (6,1)\n\n5: (6,2)\n\n6: (6,3)\n\n7: tail (5,3)\n\nMove to (5,3): new head at (5,3)\n\nThen new P[1] = old P[0] = (4,3)\n\nNew P[2] = old P[1] = (4,2)\n\nNew P[3] = old P[2] = (4,1)\n\nNew P[4] = old P[3] = (5,1)\n\nNew P[5] = old P[4] = (6,1)\n\nNew P[6] = old P[5] = (6,2)\n\nNew P[7] = old P[6] = (6,3)  // new tail\n\nOld tail (5,3) is now head, so it's gone, no issue.\n\nSo snake now: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nHead at (5,3), direction R (since I moved right from (4,3) to (5,3)? From (4,3) to (5,3) is right, so direction R.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other places.\n\nBut I didn't eat the food at (4,4), which has life 7, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is eaten.\n\nNow, back to turn 19.\n\nFor turn 19, I have to go U to (4,2), as it's the only choice.\n\nThen for turn 20, from (4,2) U to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nThen for turn 21, from (4,3) I need to decide.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,6). It's at (1,6), life 10, so I have until turn 28 or so to eat it.\n\nCurrent turn 19, life 10, so after turn 19, life 9; turn 20, life 8; ... until turn 28, life 1; turn 29, life 0, disappears. So I need to eat by turn 28.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nNow, after eating (4,3), on turn 21, if I go to (4,4), I can eat that food too.\n\nBut let's see the grid and potential dead ends.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,1) might block some paths.\n\nAlso, the snake body is on the bottom right.\n\nAfter turn 20, snake at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo the cells around (4,3): up (4,4) has food, left (3,3) free, right (5,3) is tail, but after move it might move.\n\nIf on turn 21 I go to (4,4), I eat the food, grow.\n\nThen snake: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) grown, so positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nLength 9.\n\nThen from (4,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nAll should be free.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), then to (4,6), then from (4,6), I can go U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, so must go L or R.\n\nSay go L to (3,6), then to (2,6), (1,6) to eat the food there.\n\nBut at (1,6), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach it without issues.\n\nFrom (4,6), if I go L to (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), all should be free, no walls or obstacles in that area.\n\nObstacle only at (3,1), so upper part is clear.\n\nThen I can eat (1,6) later.\n\nBut the snake is long, so I need space to move.\n\nAnother option: from (4,3) on turn 21, instead of going U to (4,4), I go L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), as before, then head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (5,4), or R to (6,3), or D to (5,2), but direction R, so opposite is L, cannot go L to (4,3), which is body anyway.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3) direction R: U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (5,4): free?\n\nR to (6,3): but (6,3) is occupied? Current positions after move to (5,3): [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] so (6,3) is occupied, so I cannot go there, collision.\n\nD to (5,2): (5,2) is free? Not occupied, no wall, so possible.\n\nU to (5,4): free.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go U to (5,4) or D to (5,2).\n\nIf I go U to (5,4), then I can go to (5,5), etc., or towards (4,4) to eat the food later.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is left and up from (5,4).\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the foods when possible, but with survival.\n\nFor now, since (4,3) is urgent and close, I should eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is also close, and I can eat it on the way.\n\nThen go for (1,6).\n\nBut let's plan the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 19: from (4,1), only U possible, so U.\n\nThen turn 20: from (4,2), go U to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,3), I need to choose.\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), eat another food, but I grow to 9, which might be risky for space.\n\nAfter eating (4,4), I am at (4,4), and the body is below, so I can go left or right to have space.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), instead of up, I can go left to (3,4), then down or left, to go towards the center or to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at top-left.\n\nSo from (4,4), go L to (3,4), then to (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut on the way, I can eat (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6).\n\nAll free.\n\nBut when I go to (1,6), I eat, grow, then need to find way out.\n\nBut the grid is 8x8, with walls, so I need to be careful not to trap.\n\nFor example, from (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\n(1,6) life 10 at turn 19, so after turn 19, life 9; turn 20, life 8; ... so by turn 28 it disappears. I have time.\n\nPerhaps for turn 21, from (4,3), I should not eat (4,4) immediately, so that I don't grow too fast.\n\nBut (4,4) has life 7, so I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, on turn 21, from (4,3), go L to (3,3).\n\nThen head to (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is free.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go U to (3,4), L to (2,3), D to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to go towards (1,6) or something.\n\nThis might be inefficient.\n\nSince the snake is long, eating both foods might be fine.\n\nAnother risk: the internal obstacle at (3,1) and the body might block paths.\n\nFor example, the area around (4,1) to (6,3) is occupied.\n\nBut if I move away, it frees up over time.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead from turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: action U to (4,2)\n\nAfter: head at (4,2), direction U, snake: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nFood: (4,3) life 3 (after decrease), (4,4) life 6, (1,6) life 9\n\nTurn 20: action U to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nAfter: head at (4,3), direction U, snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]  // length 8\n\nFood eaten: (4,3) gone, so only (4,4) and (1,6)\n\n(4,4) life now 5 (after turn 20 decrease)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3), I have choices.\n\nOption 1: U to (4,4) to eat food.\n\nAfter: head at (4,4), direction U, snake: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]  // length 9\n\n(4,4) eaten.\n\nThen from (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 22: possible actions: U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), then head to (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 23: U to (4,6) or L to (3,5) or R to (5,5), etc.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go L to (3,6) or R to (5,6), since U to (4,7) wall.\n\nThen to (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut at (1,6), I eat on turn, say, 26 or something.\n\nBut life span of (1,6) is long, so ok.\n\nBut with length 9, moving to (1,6) might be tight, but possible.\n\nOption 2: on turn 21, from (4,3), instead of U, I go L to (3,3).\n\nThen head to (3,3), direction L.\n\nSnake: after move, head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3) moved to (6,3)? After move to (3,3): new head (3,3), new body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // new tail at (6,3)\n\nOld tail (5,3) moved to (6,3).\n\nSo snake: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nThen from (3,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 22: possible moves: U to (3,4), L to (2,3), D to (3,2) (since not opposite, direction L, opposite R, so can go U, D, L)\n\nL to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is free, (2,3) free, (3,4) free.\n\nI can go towards (1,6), e.g. L to (2,3), then U to (2,4), etc., but slower.\n\nBut (4,4) food is still there, I can eat it later from the left or something.\n\nBut it might be less efficient.\n\nSince (4,4) is close, I should eat it while I can.\n\nMoreover, not eating it might not save space, because it will disappear eventually.\n\nSo probably better to eat both.\n\nThen after eating both, go for (1,6).\n\nBut to avoid being trapped, from (4,4), I can go left to (3,4) instead of up, to start moving left early.\n\nLet's define a path.\n\nTurn 19: U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 20: U to (4,3) eat\n\nTurn 21: U to (4,4) eat\n\nNow head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 22: instead of U, I go L to (3,4) to start moving left.\n\nAction L to (3,4)\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nSnake: after move to (3,4), new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) since no eat, tail moved? After turn 21, after eating (4,4), snake is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nMove to (3,4): (3,4) has no food, so move normally.\n\nNew head (3,4), new body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // new tail at (6,3)\n\nOld tail (5,3) moved to (6,3).\n\nSo snake: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nHead at (3,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 23: from (3,4), direction L, possible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), D to (3,3) (not R, opposite).\n\nI can go U to (3,5) to go up.\n\nThen to (3,6), etc.\n\nTurn 23: U to (3,5)\n\nHead to (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 24: U to (3,6)\n\nHead to (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 25: from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, or R to (4,6), or D, but direction U, opposite D, so cannot D.\n\nPossible: U invalid, so L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body? Current positions: after turn 24, if I went to (3,6), snake: let's track.\n\nAfter turn 22: head (3,4), body as above\n\nTurn 23: move U to (3,5), new head (3,5), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail to (6,3) moved? Positions: new head (3,5), new body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // new tail at (6,2)? Old tail (6,3) moved to (6,2)? Let's index.\n\nAfter turn 22: positions: 0:(3,4), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(4,2), 4:(4,1), 5:(5,1), 6:(6,1), 7:(6,2), 8:(6,3) tail? 9 positions? After turn 21, after eating (4,4), length 9, then turn 22 move to (3,4), no eat, so length 9, positions: head (3,4), then body: old head (4,4), old body, so P[1] = (4,4), P[2] = (4,3), P[3] = (4,2), P[4] = (4,1), P[5] = (5,1), P[6] = (6,1), P[7] = (6,2), P[8] = (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,5) on turn 23: new head (3,5), new P[1] = old P[0] = (3,4), P[2] = old P[1] = (4,4), P[3] = old P[2] = (4,3), P[4] = old P[3] = (4,2), P[5] = old P[4] = (4,1), P[6] = old P[5] = (5,1), P[7] = old P[6] = (6,1), P[8] = old P[7] = (6,2)  // new tail at (6,2)\n\nOld tail (6,3) is gone.\n\nSnake: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 24: move U to (3,6), new head (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), tail to (6,2)? New positions: head (3,6), P[1] = (3,5), P[2] = (3,4), P[3] = (4,4), P[4] = (4,3), P[5] = (4,2), P[6] = (4,1), P[7] = (5,1), P[8] = (6,1)  // tail at (6,1)\n\n(6,2) is gone.\n\nNow head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nTurn 25: from (3,6), direction U, possible moves: U to (3,7) invalid wall, L to (2,6), R to (4,6), D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied, and also opposite? Direction U, opposite is D, so cannot move D to (3,5).\n\nSo possible: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, (4,6) free.\n\nI can go L to (2,6) to go towards (1,6).\n\nThen turn 25: L to (2,6)\n\nHead to (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 26: L to (1,6) to eat food.\n\n(1,6) has food, so eat it.\n\nThen grow, and so on.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nI could have gone directly from (4,4) to (4,5) etc., but by going left early, I can reach (1,6) faster.\n\nIn this plan, on turn 26 I eat (1,6), which is within life span.\n\nLife span of (1,6) at turn 19 is 10, after decreases, at turn 25, let's calculate: turn 19 start life 10, after turn 19 action decrease to 9, turn 20 to 8, ..., turn 24 to 5? Let's see:\n\nStart turn 19: life 10\n\nAfter turn 19 action: life decreases to 9 (before turn 20)\n\nTurn 20: before action, life 9, after action decrease to 8 before turn 21\n\n...\n\nBefore turn t, life span is initial minus (t - t_spawn) or something.\n\nEasier: at the beginning of each turn, life span decreases by 1 from previous.\n\nAt turn 19, food (1,6) has life 10.\n\nAfter turn 19, at start of turn 20, life 9.\n\nStart of turn 21, life 8.\n\n...\n\nStart of turn 25, life 10 - (25-19) = 10 - 6 = 4? Turn difference.\n\nAt start of turn t, life = initial life - (t - t_spawn)\n\nBut t_spawn not given, only current life at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, life 10, so it will decrease each turn.\n\nAt start of turn 20, life 9\n\nStart turn 21, life 8\n\nStart turn 22, life 7\n\nStart turn 23, life 6\n\nStart turn 24, life 5\n\nStart turn 25, life 4\n\nStart turn 26, life 3\n\n...\n\nUntil life 0 at start of turn 29.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 26, life 3, still there.\n\nIn the plan above, turn 26: move to (1,6) and eat.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,4), in this plan, eaten on turn 21.\n\nNow, back to turn 21 choice.\n\nIn the plan, I went U to (4,4) on turn 21.\n\nBut I could have gone other ways, but this seems efficient.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U (to (4,3) eat)\n\nTurn 21: U (to (4,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 22: L (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 23: U (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 24: U (to (3,6))\n\nThen turn 25: L (to (2,6)) or R? In the plan, I said L to (2,6)\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nTo go to (1,6), better to go L.\n\nThen turn 26: L to (1,6) eat.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, at least 5, so up to turn 23 or 24.\n\nThe current turn is 19, so output for turn 19,20,21,... say 5 turns: 19,20,21,22,23.\n\nIn the format: Turn 19: action, Turn 20: action, etc.\n\nFor turn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nThen for turn 22: from (4,4), go L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 23: from (3,4), go U to (3,5)\n\nIn the sequence above.\n\nBut after turn 21, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 22: I go L to (3,4), so action L.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 23: from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), action U.\n\nThen turn 24: U to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut for output, I think up to turn 23 is fine, since 5 turns from 19: 19,20,21,22,23.\n\nturns: 19,20,21,22,23 → 5 actions.\n\nSimilarly, I need to specify.\n\nBut in turn 22, when I go L to (3,4), is it safe? Yes.\n\nAnd no immediate risks.\n\nAfter that, I can continue to (3,5), etc.\n\nTo be complete.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,4) might be eaten later, but in this plan I eat it on turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 21 I eat (4,4).\n\nBut if I don't eat it, it might be wasted, but life is long, 7 at turn 19, so I can eat later, but since I'm there, better to eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nThen for turn 24, I would go U to (3,6), but since only 5 turns, not necessary.\n\nIn the answer format, I should output for the turns specified.\n\nThe user says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is for actions starting from t1.\n\nI think output for turn 19 to, say, 23 or 24.\n\nBut to be safe, let's do 5 actions: turns 19,20,21,22,23.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction.\n\nAfter turn 19: move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 20: move U, direction U.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 21: move U to (4,4), direction U.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 22: move L to (3,4), so direction now L.\n\nTurn 23: from (3,4), direction L, move U to (3,5), which is valid, since not opposite; opposite of L is R, so U is allowed.\n\nThen direction becomes U.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 19 Decision and Future Planning\n\n**Current State (Turn 19):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 (coordinates (0,0) to (7,7)) with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1).\n- **Snake**: Head at (4,1), direction Left (L).

Must eat soon to avoid loss.\n   - (4,4) has moderate life but is directly above (4,3); eating both sequentially is efficient.\n   - (1,6) has long life (disappears after turn 28); can be targeted later after handling urgent food.\n2. **Snake Growth and Survival**:\n   - Eating (4,3) and (4,4) increases length to 9, but the grid has space to navigate toward (1,6) without immediate traps.\n   - Path to (1,6) via left then up (e.g., (3,4) → (3,5) → (3,6) → (2,6) → (1,6)) is safe and avoids body/obstacles.\n   - Moving away from the dense body area (around (4,1)-(6,3)) early reduces collision risks.\n3. **Collision Avoidance**:\n   - After eating (4,3) and (4,4), the snake body will occupy more cells, but the planned path keeps the head moving toward open areas.\n   - No tail reward danger: Tail positions do not have food.\n4. **Long-Term Strategy**:\n   - Eat (4,3) on turn 20 and (4,4) on turn 21 to secure +2 score quickly.\n   - Then shift left to (3,4) on turn 22 to start path toward (1,6), eating it around turn 26 (within life span).\n   - This plan maximizes score by eating all food while ensuring survival through open navigation.\n\n**Planned Actions (Turns 19-23):**\n- **Turn 19 (from (4,1), direction L)**: Move U to (4,2). (Forced move; only option.)\n- **Turn 20 (from (4,2), direction U)**: Move U to (4,3) to eat food (+1 score, length 8). (Urgent; life span short.)\n- **Turn 21 (from (4,3), direction U)**: Move U to (4,4) to eat food (+1 score, length 9). (Efficient; directly above.)\n- **Turn 22 (from (4,4), direction U)**: Move L to (3,4). (Begins path to (1,6); avoids going up into corner early.)\n- **Turn 23 (from (3,4), direction L)**: Move U to (3,5). (Continues toward (1,6); safe and open.)\n\n**Future Outlook (Beyond Turn 23):**\n- Turn 24: Move U to (3,6) (direction U).\n- Turn 25: Move L to (2,6) (direction L).\n- Turn 26: Move L to (1,6) to eat food (+1 score, within life span).\n\nThis plan eats all food by turn 26, adds 3 to length, and avoids risks by steering clear of walls/obstacles and body collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: L \\\\\nTurn 23: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 20, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are there, so I can't go to those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,2), then body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So let's list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 4: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 5: (6,3)\n\n- Tail: (5,3)  // since there are 7 positions, indices 0 to 6, head at 0, tail at 6.\n\nPositions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nSo head is at (4,2), and the direction is U, which is up. So last move was up, meaning from (4,1) to (4,2), I think. Direction U means the head is facing up, so moving up increased y by 1.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so from turn 19 to 20, it moved to (4,2) from (4,1) by going up.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,3) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (4,4) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (4,3), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including the current turn? Let me check the rules.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for (4,3), life_span=3, so on turn 20, it has 3 turns left including turn 20. After turn 20, it will have 2 left, and so on, disappearing after turn 22 or when countdown reaches 0? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, if life_span=N, it will disappear after N-1 more turns? Let's clarify.\n\nSay at turn t, food has life_span L. It will be present for L turns, including turn t. So after turn t+L-1, it disappears; it is gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 20, food at (4,3) with life_span=3: present on turns 20, 21, 22; gone on turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4): life_span=6, present turns 20 to 25, gone turn 26.\n\n(1,6): life_span=9, present turns 20 to 28, gone turn 29.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is occupied by wall, so it's blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo let's plot this.\n\nAssume x horizontal, y vertical, with (0,0) bottom left or top left? Usually in coordinates, (x,y), x right, y up, but in grid terms, sometimes y increases down. But in the movement, U is (x,y+1), which is up, so y+1 is up, meaning y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's see.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is higher row, like y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSimilarly, D is (x,y-1), down.\n\nL (x-1,y), left\n\nR (x+1,y), right\n\nWalls: x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nNow snake:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Then (4,1) — directly below head\n\n- Then (5,1) — right of (4,1)\n\n- Then (6,1) — further right\n\n- Then (6,2) — up from (6,1)\n\n- Then (6,3) — up from (6,2)\n\n- Then (5,3) — left of (6,3)\n\nSo the snake body: from head (4,2) down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), then left to (5,3). So it's like a shape: from (4,2) down, then right, then up, then left to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is the tail.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (4,3) — directly above head at (4,2), since U is (x,y+1), so (4,3) is one up from head.\n\n- (4,4) — two up from head, but (4,3) is there first.\n\n- (1,6) — far left, top, x=1,y=6.\n\nHead direction is U, so it can move U, L, or R? But no instant reverse, so since it came from down to up (from (4,1) to (4,2), so it was moving up, so it cannot move down immediately, because down is opposite of up.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, meaning it is facing up, so possible moves are U, L, R, but not D, because D is reverse.\n\nFrom the rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo current direction is U, so cannot move D on next turn.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,3)\n\n- L: to (3,2)\n\n- R: to (5,2)\n\nNow, (4,3) has food! But let's see if it's safe to eat.\n\nFirst, check for collisions.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3):\n\n- Is (4,3) a wall? No, walls are at borders and (3,1), (4,3) is x=4,y=3, which is within 1-6, and not (3,1), so not wall.\n\n- Body collision: snake body segments are at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). (4,3) is not any of these, so no body collision.\n\nBut (4,3) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n\nNow, when I eat food, snake grows: since it's positive food, length increases by one, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays in place for that turn, and head moves to food, so new position includes head at food and all body, tail doesn't move.\n\nThen next turn, tail moves.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose before move, positions P = [head, body..., tail]\n\nAfter moving to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n\nIf moving to food, head moves to food, new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move, and positions grow.\n\nSpecifically: when snake moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the head is now at that cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail stays, and snake length increases.\n\nWhen moving to empty cell, head moves to new cell, tail moves off its cell, so positions shift.\n\nNow, in this case, if I move U to (4,3), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nHead is at (4,2), tail is at (5,3).\n\nAre they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(4,2) and (5,3): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1, or same y and x differs by 1.\n\nSo (4,2) and (5,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nAdjacent cells: for (4,2), adjacent are (4,3), (4,1), (3,2), (5,2). Not (5,3).\n\nTail is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to head (4,2). So no issue.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (4,3) should be safe, and I eat the food, grow to length 8.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. Also, the food at (4,3) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 22 if not eaten. But since I can eat it now on turn 20, it's fine.\n\nNow, other moves: L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\n(3,2): is it safe? Not a wall, not occupied by body? Body positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). (3,2) not in list, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2): not in body positions, not wall.\n\nBut (5,2) is empty, no food.\n\n(3,2) also no food mentioned.\n\nFood only at (4,3), (4,4), (1,6).\n\nSo moving U gets immediate reward.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake will be longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nCurrent length 7, after eating becomes 8.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid layout.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except (3,1) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nSo cells: total cells 6x6=36, minus one obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 7 cells, so 28 free cells? But food is on some, but food cells are not occupied by snake, I think.\n\nFood positions: (4,3), (4,4), (1,6) are not snake positions, since snake is at (4,2), (4,1), etc., (4,3) is food, not snake.\n\nSo free cells include the food cells, but when eaten, they become snake.\n\nCurrently, snake positions: 7 cells.\n\nWalls: borders and (3,1), but walls are not part of grid for movement, so cells available for movement are the 35 cells minus snake occupied? No.\n\nThe grid has cells, some are walls, some are free, some have snake, some have food.\n\nBut for movement, I can only move to free cells or food cells, but not walls or body.\n\nAfter moving, if to food, it becomes body.\n\nIn this case, cells:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,1). So these are inaccessible.\n\n- Snake occupied: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n- Food: (4,3), (4,4), (1,6)\n\n- Other cells are free.\n\nNow, back to turn 20.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Move U to (4,3): eat food, grow to length 8. New head at (4,3), and tail stays at (5,3), but since I ate, a new segment is added, so positions: after move, head moves to (4,3), but since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] — (5,3) is now part of body, not tail? Let's see.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,3) and eating food:\n\n- Head moves to (4,3)\n\n- Segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,2)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to previous seg1 position (4,1)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to previous seg2 position (5,1)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to previous seg3 position (6,1)\n\n- Segment 5 moves to previous seg4 position (6,2)\n\n- Segment 6 (tail) moves to previous seg5 position (6,3)? No.\n\nWhen eating, tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo after eating:\n\n- New head at (4,3)\n\n- New segment 1: (4,2)  // previous head\n\n- New segment 2: (4,1)  // previous seg1\n\n- New segment 3: (5,1)  // previous seg2\n\n- New segment 4: (6,1)  // previous seg3\n\n- New segment 5: (6,2)  // previous seg4\n\n- New segment 6: (6,3)  // previous seg5\n\n- New segment 7: (5,3)  // previous tail, now new segment, tail stays\n\nSo positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] with head at (4,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nTail is still at (5,3).\n\nNow, head direction after move: since I moved U, new head direction is U.\n\nNow, from here, I can plan next moves.\n\nBut let's consider other options for turn 20.\n\nIf I move L to (3,2): no food, so just move.\n\nNew positions: head to (3,2), then body: seg1 to (4,2), seg2 to (4,1), seg3 to (5,1), seg4 to (6,1), seg5 to (6,2), seg6 to (6,3), tail leaves (5,3), so positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] with tail at (6,3)? Let's see.\n\nOriginal: 0:(4,2), 1:(4,1), 2:(5,1), 3:(6,1), 4:(6,2), 5:(6,3), 6:(5,3)\n\nAfter move L to (3,2), no food eaten:\n\n- Head to (3,2)\n\n- Seg1 to (4,2)  // prev head\n\n- Seg2 to (4,1)  // prev seg1\n\n- Seg3 to (5,1)  // prev seg2\n\n- Seg4 to (6,1)  // prev seg3\n\n- Seg5 to (6,2)  // prev seg4\n\n- Seg6 to (6,3)  // prev seg5\n\n- Tail was (5,3), but since no eat, tail moves off, so new tail is (6,3), which was seg5, now seg6.\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] with head at (3,2), tail at (6,3).\n\nDirection now L.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (5,2): no food, new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) with tail at (6,3)? Original tail (5,3) moves off.\n\nOriginal: after move R to (5,2):\n\n- Head to (5,2)\n\n- Seg1 to (4,2)\n\n- Seg2 to (4,1)\n\n- Seg3 to (5,1)\n\n- Seg4 to (6,1)\n\n- Seg5 to (6,2)\n\n- Seg6 to (6,3)  // prev seg5\n\n- Tail (5,3) gone, so positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nBut in this case, I didn't eat the food at (4,3), which is still there.\n\nNow, comparing the options.\n\nIf I move U, I get +1 score immediately, but snake is longer, which might be riskier.\n\nIf I move L or R, I avoid eating now, but the food at (4,3) has only 3 turns life, so if not eaten soon, it disappears.\n\nLife span 3 at turn 20, so it can be eaten on turn 20,21,22; gone on 23.\n\nSo I have time, but not much.\n\nSimilarly, other food at (4,4) and (1,6) have longer life.\n\nBut (4,4) is above (4,3), so if I eat (4,3), I can go to (4,4) next.\n\nBut let's think about the area.\n\nThe snake is currently in the bottom-left to right area, with a sort of loop.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo it's like a filled area, and head at (4,3).\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, L, R, not D because direction U.\n\nU to (4,4): has food! (4,4) has food with value 1.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), eat it, grow to length 9.\n\nBut is it safe? (4,4) not wall, not body. Body positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and (4,3) is new head, but (4,4) not occupied, so yes.\n\nThen after eating, head at (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] tail at (5,3).\n\nBut now, head at (4,4), and tail at (5,3), which is adjacent? (4,4) and (5,3): x diff 1, y diff 1, diagonal, not adjacent. So no tail reward danger.\n\nThen from there, I can go left or right or up, but y=4, up to (4,5) or down, but direction U, so cannot D immediately.\n\nBut (4,5) might be free, or I can go L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nBut let's see the big picture.\n\nIf on turn 20 I don't eat, say I move L to (3,2).\n\nThen positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen on turn 21, from (3,2), possible moves: U, D, L, but not R since reverse.\n\nL to (2,2)? But x=2,y=2, is it wall? Borders are x=0,x=7 walls, so x=2 is fine.\n\nU to (3,3), D to (3,1), but (3,1) is wall, internal obstacle, so cannot move D.\n\nD to (3,1) is invalid, wall.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but R is reverse? Current direction is L, so moving R would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nSo only U or L or D, but D to (3,1) is wall, so only U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\n(3,3): is it free? No food mentioned, and not snake position, so probably free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) free.\n\nIf I go U to (3,3), then I can later go to (4,3) to eat food, but (4,3) has food, but on turn 21, it will have life span 2 left, so can be eaten.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nThe snake is near the bottom, and there is a food at (1,6) which is top-left, far away.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (3,1) blocks the bottom-left.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both (4,3) and (4,4), and then maybe go to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be harder to reach (1,6) without trapping myself.\n\nCurrent turn 20, I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating immediately to keep snake shorter for maneuverability.\n\nBut eating gives score, and the food will disappear soon.\n\n(4,3) disappears after turn 22, so I have until turn 22 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) disappears after turn 25.\n\n(1,6) after turn 28.\n\nOn turn 20, if I move U, I eat (4,3) and can immediately go to (4,4) on turn 21.\n\nThen I have two foods quickly.\n\nBut after that, the snake is longer, and I need to find a way out.\n\nFrom (4,4) after eating both, positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo the body occupies (4,1) to (4,3) vertically, and (5,1) to (6,3) in a sort of L shape.\n\nHead at (4,4), so I can move U to (4,5), L to (3,4), or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I move U to (4,5), it's free, I assume.\n\nThen I can keep going up to (4,6), but y=6, and y=7 is wall, so (4,6) is top.\n\nBut there is food at (1,6), so I need to go left.\n\nBut the snake body is blocking the right and bottom.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), if I go L to (3,4), then to (2,4), etc., towards (1,6).\n\nOr go R to (5,4), but that might lead to dead end.\n\nThe area to the left is more open.\n\n(3,4) is free, I think.\n\nThen I can go to (2,4), (1,4), then up to (1,5), (1,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat now, I might go directly to (1,6) first, but (1,6) is far, and (4,3) might disappear.\n\nLife span: (4,3) must be eaten by turn 22, (1,6) by turn 28.\n\nTurn 20 to 22 is only 3 turns, so I need to eat (4,3) soon.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) can wait.\n\nSo perhaps I should eat (4,3) now or soon.\n\nBut let's consider the risk of eating now.\n\nIf I move U on turn 20, eat (4,3), then on turn 21, from (4,3), direction U, I can move U to (4,4) to eat that food immediately.\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) or R to (5,4) or U to (4,5).\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), then on turn 23, from (4,5), to (4,6) or (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nThen to (1,6), I need to go left.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the left side might be cramped.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), I can go L to (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) to eat on turn 25 or something.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, after eating both, snake at turn 21 after eating (4,4): positions [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] head (4,4)\n\nNow move to turn 22: suppose I move L to (3,4), no food, so positions: head to (3,4), then body: seg1 to (4,4), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (4,2), seg4 to (4,1), seg5 to (5,1), seg6 to (6,1), seg7 to (6,2), seg8 to (6,3), tail leaves (5,3), so positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 23, from (3,4), can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nD to (3,3), U to (3,5), L to (2,4).\n\n(3,3) might be free, (3,5) free, (2,4) free.\n\nI can go L to (2,4), then turn 24 to (1,4), then turn 25 to (1,5), turn 26 to (1,6) to eat.\n\n(1,6) has life span 9, so on turn 26 it is still there? Turn 20: life 9, present turn 20 to 28, so turn 26 is fine.\n\nBut on turn 26, eat at (1,6), grow to length 10.\n\nThen I need to find a way out, but the top row is y=6, and left is x=1.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), but (1,5) might be free, but snake body is below.\n\nAfter eating at (1,6), positions would be head at (1,6), body including (1,5) if I came from there, etc.\n\nBut the area is small, and with length 10, it might be tight.\n\nTotal free cells initially 35, snake 7, food 3, so free non-food 25.\n\nAfter eating all food, snake length 10, so occupies 10 cells, 25 free, but some might be blocked.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAnother option: on turn 20, I move L to (3,2), then to (3,3) or (2,2), and leave the food for later, but (4,3) is only available for 3 turns.\n\nIf I move L on turn 20 to (3,2), then on turn 21, from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nIf I go U to (3,3), then on turn 22, from (3,3), I can go to (4,3) to eat, since (4,3) is still there if I do it on turn 22.\n\nTurn 22: (4,3) last chance.\n\nFrom (3,3), on turn 22, I can move R to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut after that, I have the same situation as before but later.\n\nAnd I missed the chance to eat (4,4) immediately.\n\nIf on turn 20 I move U, I get both (4,3) and (4,4) quickly, then go to (1,6).\n\nBut let's check if moving U on turn 20 is safe in terms of Tail Reward Danger.\n\nHead at (4,2), tail at (5,3), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), which are not adjacent; (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n\n(4,3) and (5,3): same y, x diff 1, so adjacent!\n\nOh, I missed that.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,3) and eating, positions: head at (4,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nAnd they are adjacent: right next to each other.\n\nNow, is this a problem? Tail Reward Danger says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nBut in this case, when I ate the food, the tail cell did not have food; the food was at (4,3), which I moved to.\n\nTail Reward Danger applies when the tail cell itself has food, and I eat that food while head is adjacent to tail.\n\nBut here, the food is at head position, not at tail.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo it's when the food is on the tail cell, and I eat it by moving to the tail cell, and head is adjacent to tail before the move.\n\nIn this case, for (4,3), the food is not on the tail; tail is at (5,3), food at (4,3).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), they are adjacent, but that's fine, as long as I don't eat food on the tail cell with head adjacent.\n\nNow, on turn 21, from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) to eat that food.\n\n(4,4) has food.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), eat it.\n\nBefore move, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), which are adjacent.\n\nBut the food is at (4,4), not on the tail cell, so Tail Reward Danger does not apply.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (4,4), new tail at (5,3), which are not adjacent; (4,4) and (5,3) are diagonal.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThen as before.\n\nBut let's consider a different path.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat both foods immediately to have shorter snake for moving to (1,6).\n\nFor example, on turn 20, move R to (5,2).\n\nThen positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 21, from (5,2), can move U, D, R, not L (reverse).\n\nU to (5,3), but (5,3) is where tail was, but after move, tail moved to (6,3), so (5,3) is free now? On turn 21, after move to (5,2), positions are [(5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] so (5,3) is free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nU to (5,3): free cell, no food.\n\nD to (5,1): but (5,1) is body segment, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) is body, occupied by seg5 or something, positions: seg4 is (6,1)? List: index 0: (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3) tail.\n\nSo (6,2) is position 5, occupied, so cannot move to (6,2).\n\nD to (5,1) is position 3, occupied.\n\nSo only possible moves from (5,2): U to (5,3) or R to (6,2) but (6,2) occupied, not free.\n\n(6,2) is occupied, so only U to (5,3) is possible? What about left? But cannot move L because direction R, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only U to (5,3) or D, but D to (5,1) occupied, or R to (6,2) occupied.\n\nSo only U to (5,3) is valid move.\n\nU to (5,3): is it free? Yes, no body, not wall.\n\nNo food, so move there.\n\nNew positions: head to (5,3), then body: seg1 to (5,2), seg2 to (4,2), seg3 to (4,1), seg4 to (5,1), seg5 to (6,1), seg6 to (6,2), tail leaves (6,3), so positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail at (6,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen on turn 22, from (5,3), can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (5,4), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) has food, life span, on turn 22, it has one turn left? Turn 20 life 3, so turn 22: present, after turn 22 gone.\n\nSo on turn 22, (4,3) can be eaten.\n\nIf I move L to (4,3), eat it.\n\nBefore move, head at (5,3), tail at (6,2).\n\nAre they adjacent? (5,3) and (6,2): x diff 1, y diff 1, diagonal, not adjacent. So no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nEat at (4,3), grow to length 8.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) with tail at (6,2)? After eating, tail stays.\n\nOriginal positions before move: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail (6,2)\n\nMove to (4,3) eat: head to (4,3), new segment added at tail, so positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] with tail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (4,3), direction L.\n\nThen I can go to (4,4) later.\n\nBut on turn 22, after eating (4,3), I can on turn 23 move U to (4,4) to eat that.\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nIn this case, I ate only one food later, but snake is shorter when moving, but I used two turns to get to (4,3) instead of eating it directly on turn 20.\n\nOn turn 20 if I eat, I get score immediately and can eat (4,4) on 21.\n\nIf I move R on 20, I eat (4,3) on 22, missing the chance to eat (4,4) on 21 if I had been there.\n\nFrom the state after eating (4,3) on 22, head at (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) on turn 23 to eat that.\n\n(4,4) is still there on turn 23? Life span 6, turn 20 to 25, so turn 23 yes.\n\nThen eat on turn 23.\n\nSo I get both, but later.\n\nThen go to (1,6).\n\nBut the snake is longer now.\n\nInitial approach gets food on turn 20 and 21, this gets on 22 and 23.\n\nBut score is the same, +1 each.\n\nBut in the first case, I have longer snake earlier, which might be riskier for survival.\n\nBut since the grid is not too full, it might be ok.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,6) is isolated, so I need to go there.\n\nBut with a shorter snake, it's easier to maneuver.\n\nCurrent length 7.\n\nIf I eat both foods, length 9.\n\nThen to (1,6), length 10.\n\nIf I go to (1,6) first with shorter snake, I can eat it, then come back for others, but (4,3) disappears soon.\n\n(4,3) by turn 22.\n\nFrom turn 20, to reach (1,6), it's at (1,6), I am at (4,2), so Manhattan distance |4-1| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7, so at least 7 moves, but with obstacles, more.\n\nDirect path: from (4,2) to (1,6), I can go left to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), then up to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — 6 moves.\n\nOr up then left, but with walls.\n\nBut (1,2) to (1,6) is 4 up, but (1,6) is y=6, so from (1,2) to (1,6) is 4 moves up.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (1,2): 3 left, then to (1,6): 4 up, total 7 moves.\n\nBut on each turn I move one cell, so from turn 20, I can reach (1,6) on turn 27 at earliest.\n\nTurn 20: start (4,2)\n\nTurn 21: to (3,2) or (4,3) etc.\n\nIf I go directly, turn 21: to (3,2) L\n\nTurn 22: to (2,2) L\n\nTurn 23: to (1,2) L\n\nTurn 24: to (1,3) U\n\nTurn 25: to (1,4) U\n\nTurn 26: to (1,5) U\n\nTurn 27: to (1,6) U eat\n\nBut (4,3) disappears after turn 22, so on turn 23 it is gone, so I can't eat it if I go to (1,6) directly.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) disappears after turn 25, so on turn 26 gone, but I reach (1,6) on turn 27, so I can eat (1,6) but miss (4,3) and (4,4).\n\n(4,4) gone on turn 26, I reach on 27, so too late.\n\n(4,4) life span 6, present turn 20 to 25, gone turn 26.\n\nTurn 25 is last chance to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) last chance turn 22.\n\nIf I go to (1,6) directly, I can eat it on turn 27, but (1,6) is present until turn 28, so ok, but I miss the other foods.\n\nScore only +1 from (1,6), whereas if I eat both (4,3) and (4,4), I get +2, and then (1,6) +1, total +3.\n\nIf I go to (1,6) first, I get only +1, and miss the others.\n\nSo better to eat the nearby foods first.\n\nTherefore, on turn 20, I should move U to eat (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 21, move U to eat (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,4), I need to move away, say L to (3,4) or R to (5,4) or U to (4,5).\n\nU to (4,5) is towards the top, but (1,6) is left-top.\n\nL to (3,4) is left.\n\nSince the left side is more open, I should go left.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 22: from (4,4), move L to (3,4)\n\nThen positions: as before, [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail (6,3) direction L.\n\nThen turn 23: from (3,4), move L to (2,4) (assume free)\n\nThen positions: head to (2,4), body to (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail leaves (6,3), so [(2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail (6,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 24: from (2,4), move L to (1,4) (free, I assume)\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail leaves (6,2), so [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] tail (6,1)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 25: from (1,4), move U to (1,5) (up)\n\nPositions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail leaves (6,1), so [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)] tail (5,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 26: from (1,5), move U to (1,6) to eat food.\n\n(1,6) has food, so eat it.\n\nBefore move, head at (1,5), tail at (5,1), not adjacent.\n\nEat at (1,6), grow to length 10.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) with tail at (5,1)\n\nNow, head at (1,6), which is top-left corner.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,6), walls: x=0 left, y=7 up, so cannot go L or U.\n\nCan go D to (1,5) or R to (2,6).\n\nBut (1,5) is body, occupied, so cannot go D.\n\nR to (2,6) might be free.\n\nIn positions, (1,5) is segment, so occupied.\n\nSo only possible move R to (2,6).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut in this path, I ate all three foods: (4,3) on turn 20, (4,4) on 21, (1,6) on 26.\n\nScore +3.\n\nAnd I survived.\n\nNow, are there risks in the moves?\n\nOn turn 20, move U to (4,3): safe, as we checked.\n\nTurn 21, move U to (4,4): safe.\n\nTurn 22, move L to (3,4): (3,4) should be free, not wall, not body.\n\nBody positions after turn 21: after eating (4,4) on turn 21, positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] as earlier.\n\n(3,4) not in list, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4), (1,4), etc., all should be free.\n\nThen on turn 26, after eating (1,6), head at (1,6), body at (1,5), (1,4), etc., so from there, only R to (2,6) is possible, since D to (1,5) occupied, U and L walls.\n\n(2,6) should be free, I assume.\n\nThen I can move to (2,6), and so on.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nt1=20.\n\nSo for turn 20,21,22,23,24,25,... but I need to specify for a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 moves.\n\nIn the path above, I have turns 20 to 26.\n\nBut for answer, I can list actions for say 5 or 6 turns.\n\nSince after eating (1,6), I need to continue, but the immediate plan is clear.\n\nTo be precise, let's define the actions.\n\nTurn 20: move U to eat (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: move U to eat (4,4)\n\nThen turn 22: move L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 23: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 24: move L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 25: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (1,6) eat\n\nBut for answer, I can list up to turn 25 or so.\n\nThe state is at turn 20, I need to output from turn 20 action.\n\nIn the path, on turn 22, when I move L from (4,4) to (3,4), direction becomes L.\n\nThen turn 23 L to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut are there alternatives?\n\nFor example, after eating (4,4) on turn 21, instead of going left immediately, I could go up to (4,5) then left.\n\nBut going left directly is shorter to (1,6).\n\nIn terms of turns, similar.\n\nBut going up might be safer or not.\n\nFor instance, on turn 22 from (4,4), move U to (4,5).\n\nThen positions: head to (4,5), no food, so body moves, tail moves off.\n\nPositions after: head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail leaves (5,3), so [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail (6,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 23: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) (since y=6, top)\n\nPositions: head (4,6), body (4,5), (4,4), etc., tail (6,2) or something.\n\nAfter move: head (4,6), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (4,4), ..., up to seg8 (6,3)? Positions: 0:(4,6), 1:(4,5), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,1), 6:(5,1), 7:(6,1), 8:(6,2) tail at (6,2) since tail left (6,3)\n\nOriginal before move: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nAfter move U to (4,6) no food: head to (4,6), seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (4,4), seg3 to (4,3), seg4 to (4,2), seg5 to (4,1), seg6 to (5,1), seg7 to (6,1), seg8 to (6,2), tail (6,3) gone, so tail at (6,2)\n\nPositions: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail (6,2)\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6), not D or U (walls or reverse? Direction U, so cannot D.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, not possible.\n\nD to (4,5) but occupied by body.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nMove L to (3,6).\n\nThen similarly, to (2,6), (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 23 from (4,6) to (3,6), then turn 24 to (2,6), turn 25 to (1,6) eat.\n\nBut (1,6) eaten on turn 25, which is earlier than previous path turn 26.\n\nIn previous left path, I ate on turn 26, here on turn 25.\n\nBut in this case, I didn't go through (1,4) etc.\n\nBut I need to compare.\n\nIn the first left path, from turn 22 L to (3,4), 23 L to (2,4), 24 L to (1,4), 25 U to (1,5), 26 U to (1,6) eat.\n\nIn this up path: turn 22 U to (4,5), 23 U to (4,6), 24 L to (3,6), 25 L to (2,6), 26 L to (1,6)? From (2,6) to (1,6) is left, but on turn 25 at (2,6), move L to (1,6) to eat.\n\nTurn 25: from (2,6) to (1,6) eat.\n\nSequence:\n\nAfter turn 21: head at (4,4)\n\nTurn 22: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 23: U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 24: L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 25: L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 26: L to (1,6) eat\n\nAte on turn 26.\n\nIf from (4,6) on turn 23, I go directly to (1,6) via left, but (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6), same as above.\n\nOn turn 24 from (4,6) to (3,6), turn 25 to (2,6), turn 26 to (1,6).\n\nBut from (4,6) to (1,6) is 3 moves left, so turn 24: to (3,6), turn 25: to (2,6), turn 26: to (1,6).\n\nAte on turn 26.\n\nIn the first left path, also on turn 26.\n\nBut in first left path, I ate on turn 26 from (1,5) to (1,6), here from (2,6) to (1,6).\n\nSame turn.\n\nBut in the up path, I went to (4,6) which is top, and the left side might be less occupied.\n\nIn terms of risk, both seem fine.\n\nBut in the first left path, when I move to (1,4) on turn 24, and (1,5) on 25, those are bottom-left, near the wall and obstacle.\n\nBut should be ok.\n\nI think moving left directly after eating is better to avoid the top row which has less space.\n\nBut since I need to reach (1,6), going up is necessary.\n\nAnyway, both paths work.\n\nBut for the actions, I should output the immediate moves.\n\nBack to turn 20.\n\nI think moving U on turn 20 is best to get the food.\n\nThen U on turn 21 for the next food.\n\nThen for the next moves, I can go left or up, but since I need to go to (1,6), going left first might be better to clear the bottom.\n\nIn the first path, going to (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), then up.\n\nOn turn 22, from (4,4), if I go L to (3,4), I am at y=4, then to (1,4) at y=4, then up to (1,5), (1,6).\n\nIn the up path, I go to y=6 then left.\n\nBut y=6 is top, with walls, so moving along top might be riskier if snake is long.\n\nFor example, at (4,6), I can only go left or right, no up or down easily.\n\nWhereas at (1,4), I can go up, down, right, etc.\n\nSo perhaps going to the side first is better for survival.\n\nTherefore, I prefer the first path: after eating (4,4), go left to (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), then up.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nSince the question is to output actions from turn t1, and think ahead, I can list for 5 or 6 turns.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nThen turn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: L (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 24: L (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 25: U (to (1,5))\n\nBut turn 25 to (1,5), then turn 26 to (1,6), but I don't need to list all.\n\nSince the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and I should specify for the immediate future.\n\nPerhaps list 5 actions: turn 20 to 24.\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: L\n\nBut on turn 24, I go to (1,4), then turn 25 U to (1,5), etc.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be complete, but I think 5 moves are sufficient.\n\nNow, is there any risk in moving L on turn 22?\n\nAfter turn 21, positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nMove L to (3,4): not occupied, not wall.\n\nThen after move, positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] as before.\n\nThen turn 23 move L to (2,4): similarly, should be free.\n\n(2,4) not in body, not wall.\n\nThen turn 24 to (1,4): same.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, the plan is solid.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan at least 5 turns ahead. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,3) on turn 20 or 21 to avoid missing it (life span 3, disappears after turn 22).\n- Eat the positive food at (4,4) shortly after, as it has a longer life span (disappears after turn 25) but is easily accessible.\n- Navigate toward (1,6) to eat it later (life span 9, disappears after turn 28), prioritizing a safe path that avoids collisions and dead ends.\n- Avoid the Tail Reward Danger by ensuring no food is eaten when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food (not applicable here).\n- Maintain maneuverability by not growing the snake unnecessarily until necessary, but the imminent disappearance of (4,3) makes eating it early optimal.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 20)\n- **Snake position**: Head at (4,2), direction U (up). Body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). Tail at (5,3).\n- **Food**: \n  - (4,3): Value +1, life span 3 (must be eaten by turn 22).\n  - (4,4): Value +1, life span 6 (must be eaten by turn 25).\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 9 (must be eaten by turn 28).\n- **Movement constraints**: Current direction U, so cannot move D (down) on turn 20. Possible moves: U (to (4,3)), L (to (3,2)), or R (to (5,2)).\n- **Risks**: \n  - Moving U eats (4,3) immediately, growing snake to length 8. This is safe as (4,3) is not a wall or body, and head (4,2) is not adjacent to tail (5,3) (diagonal, not sharing edge).\n  - Not eating (4,3) risks missing it due to short life span.\n- **Long-term plan**: After eating (4,3) and (4,4), move left toward (1,6) to eat it by turn 26. The left path (via (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)) is safer than going up first, as it avoids the cramped top row (y=6) and allows more movement options.\n\n### Planned Moves (5+ Turns Ahead)\n1. **Turn 20 (t1=20)**: Move U to (4,3) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length 8). This is optimal due to life span and accessibility. No collision risk.\n2. **Turn 21**: Move U to (4,4) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length 9). Safe: (4,4) is not wall/body, and head (4,3) is not adjacent to tail (5,3) (diagonal).\n3. **Turn 22**: Move L to (3,4) to start navigating left toward (1,6). Safe: (3,4) is free (not wall/body), and direction change to L is allowed (not reverse from U).\n4. **Turn 23**: Move L to (2,4) to continue left path. Safe: (2,4) is free, and L move is consistent with direction.\n5. **Turn 24**: Move L to (1,4) to approach (1,6). Safe: (1,4) is free, and L move is consistent.\n6. **Turn 25**: Move U to (1,5) to ascend toward (1,6). Safe: (1,5) should be free, and U move is allowed (direction from (1,4) is L, so U is not reverse).\n7. **Turn 26**: Move U to (1,6) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length 10). Safe if (1,6) is still present (life span until turn 28).\n\n### Path Summary and Risk Mitigation\n- **Score gain**: Eat all 3 foods for +3 score by turn 26.\n- **Survival focus**: \n  - The path avoids walls, body collisions, and instant reverses.\n  - After eating (1,6), the snake can move R to (2,6) on turn 27 to avoid corner trap (only R possible from (1,6)).\n  - Grid has 35 free cells initially; after eating all food, snake length 10, leaving 25 free cells for movement, which is manageable.\n- **Why not delay eating (4,3)?** If (4,3) is missed, score decreases by 1. Moving directly to (1,6) first takes at least 7 turns (arrive turn 27), missing (4,3) and (4,4).\n- **Efficiency**: Eating (4,3) and (4,4) early minimizes movement and leverages proximity.\n\n### Answer Format\nThe actions for turns 20 to 24 are listed below, covering 5 turns as required. The full plan to turn 26 is included for context.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U (up)  \nTurn 21: U (up)  \nTurn 22: L (left)  \nTurn 23: L (left)  \nTurn 24: L (left)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and food.\n\nThe grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, I can't move to those cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,3), and the body segments follow: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the snake is 8 segments long. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Next: (4,2)\n\n- Then: (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- Tail: (5,3)\n\nThe head direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,4) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1. No negative food mentioned here.\n\nLife span: Food disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including the current one. So for (4,4), life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns, including turn 21. Similarly, (1,6) has life span 8, so it has 8 turns left including turn 21.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7 is 8 cells, y from 0 to 7 is 8 cells, but walls are at the borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells are walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid has cells from x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (3,1) is an obstacle, so not playable.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\n- (4,3) head\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,1) — this is at (4,1), but (3,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) is playable? (4,1) is not a wall, only (3,1) is obstacle.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (3,1). So (4,1) should be free, but snake is there.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,4) and (1,6).\n\n(4,4) is directly above the head, since head is at (4,3) moving up.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so if I move up, I go to (4,4), which has food.\n\nBut I need to consider if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's see possible moves.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,3)\n\nDirection: U (up)\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) next, because that would be reverse.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, L, R. D is not allowed.\n\nNow, what happens if I move U to (4,4)?\n\n(4,4) has food with value +1. So eating it would increase length by 1.\n\nBut I need to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, is (4,4) a wall? No, walls are borders and (3,1), (4,4) is within 1-6 in x and y, not obstacle.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake grows by one segment, so new head at (4,4), and tail... since I eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move; a new segment is added where the tail was.\n\nSnake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food, tail stays, so new segment added at previous tail position.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,4) which has food, I eat it, so:\n\n- New head position: (4,4)\n\n- Body: previous positions, but since length increases, the tail remains where it is, so the new body includes all previous segments plus the tail doesn't move.\n\nLet me list the current snake positions:\n\nIndex: 0: head (4,3)\n\n1: (4,2)\n\n2: (4,1)\n\n3: (5,1)\n\n4: (6,1)\n\n5: (6,2)\n\n6: (6,3)\n\n7: tail (5,3)\n\nAfter moving up to (4,4) and eating food:\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nThen the body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and the tail (5,3) stays, so now segments: head (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So 9 segments.\n\nNow, is there collision? Head at (4,4), and body segments: (4,3) is adjacent, but not the same cell, so no collision. (4,4) is not occupied by any body segment currently? Let's see the positions: before move, (4,4) was empty, I think, since food is there, but snake is not on it yet.\n\nAfter move, head at (4,4), which was food, now occupied.\n\nBody: (4,3) which was head, now body, (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) tail still there.\n\nIs (4,4) the same as any body cell? (4,3) is below, not same. Others are not (4,4). So no collision.\n\nNow, walls: not a wall.\n\nBut there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (5,3), and head is moving to (4,4). Is head adjacent to tail?\n\nCurrent head (4,3) and tail (5,3) are adjacent? (4,3) and (5,3) are horizontally adjacent, so yes, adjacent.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has positive food, then eating that food would cause death because after eating, head moves to food (which was tail position), and the new tail grows, but since it was tail, and head moves there, but in this case, I'm not eating the tail cell.\n\nTail is at (5,3), but I'm moving to (4,4), not to (5,3). The food I'm eating is at (4,4), which is not the tail cell.\n\nTail Reward Danger specifically when eating food that is on the tail cell.\n\nFrom the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nHere, tail cell is (5,3), and it has food? Currently, (5,3) is the tail position, but is there food on it? The food positions given are (4,4) and (1,6), not (5,3). So (5,3) has no food; it's part of the snake.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, moving up to (4,4) seems safe and I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, life span of food: (4,4) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including this one, so if I don't eat it now, it might be gone soon.\n\n(4,4) life span 5 at turn 21, so it will be there for turns 21,22,23,24,25, and disappear after turn 25? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 21, life span 5, so countdown 5. After turn 21, countdown becomes 4, and so on, until countdown 0, then disappears. So it exists as long as countdown > 0.\n\nSo for (4,4): at turn 21, countdown=5, so present on turns 21,22,23,24,25? After turn 25, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 8, countdown=8 at turn 21, so present until turn 28.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nIf I move up to (4,4), I eat the food, score +1, length 9.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nNow, what next? I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nBut first, let's see other options.\n\nI could move left or right instead.\n\nMove left to (3,3)? (3,3) is within grid? x=3, y=3.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, but (3,1) is obstacle, but (3,3) is not, so should be free.\n\nIs (3,3) occupied? Snake positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), etc., no (3,3), so free.\n\nSimilarly, move right to (5,3), but (5,3) is the tail! Tail is at (5,3).\n\nIf I move to (5,3), which is the tail.\n\nIn snake, moving to the tail is usually safe because the tail will move away, but only if I don't eat food there.\n\nHere, (5,3) has no food, so if I move to (5,3), since it's the tail, and I don't eat food, then head moves to (5,3), tail moves forward, so the cell (5,3) is now head, and the previous tail moves to the next position, so no collision.\n\nCurrent tail is (5,3), and before that is (6,3), I think.\n\nSnake positions: ... (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nIf head moves to (5,3), which is the current tail position.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head moves to (5,3)\n\n- Since no food eaten, the tail moves forward. The tail was at (5,3), but now head is there, so the segment that was tail moves to where? The tail segment is removed, and the new tail is the next segment.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no growth.\n\nSo positions: before move, segments: 0:(4,3), 1:(4,2), 2:(4,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(6,1), 5:(6,2), 6:(6,3), 7:(5,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3):\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nThen body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nBut (6,3) was segment 6, now it becomes the second last, and (5,3) was tail, but head moved there, so the segment that was at (5,3) is no longer tail; instead, the segment that was at (6,3) is now the tail? Let's index.\n\nAfter move: head is new position (5,3)\n\nThen the first body segment is previous head (4,3)\n\nThen (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nAnd the tail is (6,3), since (5,3) was tail but now head is there, so tail is (6,3)\n\n(6,3) was segment 6, now it's the last segment, tail.\n\nAnd the segment that was at (5,3) is gone? No: the positions shift.\n\nThe snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo after moving head to (5,3):\n\n- Segment 0 (head) to (5,3)\n\n- Segment 1 was (4,3) to where segment 0 was? No: segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, but segment 0 was (4,3), so segment 1 moves to (4,3)\n\nGenerally: new head position, then for each subsequent segment, it moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New segment 0: (5,3)  // head moved here\n\n- Segment 1: was (4,3), but now it moves to where segment 0 was, which is (4,3)? No.\n\nPositions before move:\n\nIndex: 0: (4,3)\n\n1: (4,2)\n\n2: (4,1)\n\n3: (5,1)\n\n4: (6,1)\n\n5: (6,2)\n\n6: (6,3)\n\n7: (5,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3):\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- Then segment 1 (which was at (4,2)) moves to the position of segment 0, which was (4,3). So segment 1 now at (4,3)\n\n- Segment 2 (was at (4,1)) moves to where segment 1 was, which was (4,2), so now at (4,2)\n\n- Segment 3 (was at (5,1)) moves to where segment 2 was, (4,1), so now at (4,1)\n\n- Segment 4 (was at (6,1)) moves to where segment 3 was, (5,1), so now at (5,1)\n\n- Segment 5 (was at (6,2)) moves to where segment 4 was, (6,1), so now at (6,1)\n\n- Segment 6 (was at (6,3)) moves to where segment 5 was, (6,2), so now at (6,2)\n\n- Segment 7 (was at (5,3)) moves to where segment 6 was, (6,3), so now at (6,3)\n\nAnd since no growth, the last segment (tail) is removed? No, in this case, segment 7 was the tail, and it moves to (6,3), but (6,3) was occupied by segment 6, but segment 6 moved to (6,2), so (6,3) is free.\n\nThe new snake positions: head at (5,3), then body at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nAnd the cell (5,3) is now head, which was tail, but since tail moved, no collision.\n\nBack to choices.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,4) - eat food, grow to 9 segments, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (3,3) - no food, so length same, head at (3,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nOption 3: Move R to (5,3) - no food, head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nD is not possible because reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's another food at (1,6) with longer life span.\n\nBut (4,4) is close and might disappear soon.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving U to eat (4,4).\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, L, R (since no reverse, direction U, so can't go D).\n\nNow, what's around (4,4):\n\n- U: (4,5) - is this valid? y=5, within 1-6? y=5, grid y from 0 to 7, walls y=0,7, so y=5 is playable.\n\n- L: (3,4)\n\n- R: (5,4)\n\nNow, check if any are walls or obstacles: (3,4) not obstacle, (5,4) not, (4,5) not.\n\nSnake positions after move: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is part of body.\n\nNow, from (4,4):\n\n- U to (4,5): free? Not in snake positions, so yes.\n\n- L to (3,4): free? Not in positions, yes.\n\n- R to (5,4): free? (5,4) not listed, so yes.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), no food, so move head, tail moves, etc.\n\nBut I should think about future food and survival.\n\nThere's food at (1,6), which is far, but life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, the snake body might block paths.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (4,4), the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver in the future.\n\nCurrent grid size: playable area x=1-6, y=1-6, but with obstacle at (3,1), so 6x6 minus one cell, 35 cells, snake is 8, after eating 9, so 26 free cells, but with one food, so 25 free? Not all cells are accessible.\n\nBut let's not count.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating now if it leads to dead ends.\n\nBut (4,4) is easy to eat.\n\nNow, alternative: if I don't eat now, move left or right.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,3).\n\nThen head at (3,3), direction L.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L (since direction L, no reverse R).\n\nU to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3).\n\nNow, (3,2): is it free? Snake: after move, head at (3,3), body: previous head (4,3) moves to (4,3)? After move L to (3,3):\n\n- Head to (3,3)\n\n- Body: segment 1 to (4,3) (previous head position)\n\nSegment 2 to (4,2) (previous seg1)\n\n Etc.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3)? Similar to before.\n\nTail is still (5,3) for now, but after move, tail moves.\n\nAfter move to (3,3) no food:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Seg1: (4,3)  // previous head\n\n- Seg2: (4,2)  // previous seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,1)  // previous seg2\n\n- Seg4: (5,1)  // previous seg3\n\n- Seg5: (6,1)  // previous seg4\n\n- Seg6: (6,2)  // previous seg5\n\n- Seg7: (6,3)  // previous seg6\n\n- Tail: (5,3) is gone, and new tail is (6,3)? Seg7 was (5,3), but seg7 moves to where seg6 was, which is (6,3), so at (6,3)\n\nList:\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Index 0: (3,3) head\n\n- Index 1: (4,3)  // from previous index 0\n\n- Index 2: (4,2)  // from previous index 1\n\n- Index 3: (4,1)  // from previous index 2\n\n- Index 4: (5,1)  // from previous index 3\n\n- Index 5: (6,1)  // from previous index 4\n\n- Index 6: (6,2)  // from previous index 5\n\n- Index 7: (6,3)  // from previous index 6\n\nPrevious index 7 was (5,3), but since no growth, it is removed, and new tail is index 7 at (6,3)\n\nSo positions: (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nNow, from (3,3), I can move to (3,4), (3,2), or (2,3).\n\n(3,2): is it free? (3,2) not in positions, and not wall, but there's obstacle at (3,1), but (3,2) is above, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free, (3,4) free.\n\nBut no food nearby except (4,4) which is still there.\n\n(4,4) food is at (4,4), which is right of (3,3)? (3,3) to (4,4) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't eat it directly.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (3,4) or (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body.\n\nAvailable moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3). R to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, so collision if I move there.\n\nSo only U, D, L.\n\nIf I go to (3,4), then I can later go to (4,4) if I turn right, but direction.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,3) at turn 21.\n\nMove R to (5,3): no food, so head to (5,3), body as before: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (6,3)? After move:\n\nHead to (5,3)\n\nSeg1 to (4,3)\n\nSeg2 to (4,2)\n\netc, up to seg7 to (6,3), tail at (6,3)\n\nPositions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nFrom (5,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (no reverse L).\n\nU to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, so collision.\n\nSo can only go U or D.\n\n(5,2): is it free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nBut (4,4) food is at (4,4), which is up-left from (5,3), not adjacent directly.\n\nTo reach (4,4) from (5,3), I need to go U to (5,4) or L, but L is not possible from (5,3) with direction R, since I just moved R, so I can't go L immediately? No, the no instant reverse means I can't move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n\nCurrent direction after moving R to (5,3) is R.\n\nSo at next turn, I can move U, D, or R, but not L (which is reverse of R).\n\nBut to go to (4,4) from (5,3), I need to go left, which is not possible immediately.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go U to (5,4), then from there, I can go L to (4,4), since from (5,4), direction U, I can go L.\n\nBut by then, (4,4) might be gone or something.\n\nLife span of (4,4) is 5 at turn 21, so if I don't eat at turn 21, at turn 22 countdown 4, etc.\n\nIf I move U at turn 21 to (4,4), I eat it.\n\nIf I move elsewhere, I can still eat it later if I can reach it within 4 more turns (since after turn 21, it has 4 turns left? Countdown decreases after each turn.\n\nAt turn 21, countdown=5 for (4,4).\n\nAfter turn 21, when we move to turn 22, countdown becomes 4.\n\nIt exists as long as countdown >0, so at turn 21, countdown=5, present; turn 22, countdown=4, present; ... turn 25, countdown=1, present; after turn 25, countdown=0, not present.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns 21,22,23,24,25.\n\nSimilarly for (1,6), turns 21 to 28.\n\nNow, back to long-term.\n\nPerhaps eating (4,4) now is good because it's easy and I get the point before it disappears.\n\nBut let's see the snake shape. After eating, the snake is coiled, with the tail at (5,3) or something, but in the new position, with head at (4,4), body down to (4,1), then right to (6,1), up to (6,3), then left to (5,3).\n\nSo it's like a C shape or something.\n\nThe area around might have dead ends.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), if I go U to (4,5), that's fine.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\n(4,6) is top, y=6, which is below y=7 wall, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) etc.\n\nBut the food at (1,6) is at top-left.\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6.\n\nTo reach (1,6) from (4,4), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), but that's far.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nThe grid is small, 6x6 playable minus one cell, but snake is long, 8 or 9, so space is tight.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, 36 cells, minus obstacle (3,1), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 8 cells, so 27 free, plus one food at (4,4), so 26 free cells? Food is on a cell, but when eaten, it's occupied.\n\nInitially, 35 cells - 8 snake - 2 food? Two food, but (4,4) and (1,6), so cells occupied: 8 snake + 2 food, but food cells are not occupied by snake, so free cells: 35 - 8 snake - 1 obstacle? Obstacle is separate.\n\nCells:\n\n- Walls: border and internal, not playable.\n\n- Playable cells: 36 cells (x1-6,y1-6) minus internal wall at (3,1), so 35 playable cells.\n\nAt start of turn 21, occupied by snake: 8 cells.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (1,6), so two cells have food.\n\nSo free cells: 35 - 8 - 2 = 25 free cells? 35 playable, 8 snake-occupied, 2 food-occupied but food can be eaten, so for movement, food cells are free to move to, except that if you move there, you eat.\n\nBut for collision, food cells are not occupied by body, so you can move there.\n\nSo from snake perspective, cells not occupied by body or walls are free, including food cells.\n\nSo free cells: 35 playable minus 8 snake-occupied, so 27 cells, including the two food cells.\n\nAfter eating one food, snake grows, so fewer free cells.\n\nBut let's focus on decision.\n\nAnother risk: if I eat (4,4), head at (4,4), then if I move L to (3,4), or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut there might be a danger with the tail.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (5,3), and head at (4,4), they are adjacent diagonally, but not directly, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger only if head moves to tail cell when it has food, but here no.\n\nNow, let's consider not eating now and going for the other food.\n\nFood at (1,6) is at top-left.\n\nFrom current position (4,3), if I move L to (3,3), then I can go to (2,3), (1,3), etc., to reach (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is at y=6, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4), then U to (3,5), U to (3,6), then L to (2,6), L to (1,6).\n\nBut from (3,3), I can also go L directly to (2,3), then U to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut it might take several turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,3), then I'm on the right side, harder to reach left.\n\nSo moving L might be better to reach (1,6).\n\nBut (4,4) food will disappear soon, so if I don't eat it, I miss it.\n\nLife span: (4,4) can be eaten until turn 25, so 5 turns from now (t21 to t25).\n\nFrom current turn 21, I can eat it on turn 22,23,etc.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (3,3) at t21, then from there, at t22, I can move U to (3,4), then at t23, I can move R to (4,4) to eat, but from (3,4), direction U, I can move R to (4,4), yes.\n\nAt t21, move L to (3,3), direction L.\n\nAt t22, from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen at t23, from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4), since direction U, moving R is not reverse, so allowed, and eat the food at (4,4).\n\nAt t23, (4,4) countdown: at t21,5; t22,4; t23,3, so still there.\n\nSo I can eat it at t23 if I want.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly, but at t21, moving L is fine.\n\nBut by eating at t23, I get the food later, but the score is the same, +1, and I grow later, which might be better for maneuverability now.\n\nBut the food point is the same.\n\nPrioritize survival, so if eating now causes a trap, but here it seems fine.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might block paths.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left area might be risky.\n\nBut currently, snake is at bottom, with segments at (4,1), (5,1), etc.\n\n(4,1) is at bottom, y=1.\n\nIf I eat at (4,4), head up, then I can avoid the bottom.\n\nBut let's think about the future.\n\nI need to maximize score, so I should eat both foods if possible.\n\n(1,6) is far, so I need to go there.\n\nIf I eat (4,4) now, I grow, then I have a longer snake to navigate to (1,6).\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can go to (1,6) with shorter snake, eat it, then come back for (4,4) if time, but (4,4) disappears sooner.\n\nLet's estimate turns to reach (1,6) from current position.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (1,6): Manhattan distance |4-1| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6, but with body, it might take more turns if I need to go around.\n\nShortest path: for example, move L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), U to (3,5), U to (3,6), then L to (2,6), L to (1,6), that's 5 moves: t21 L, t22 U, t23 U, t24 U, t25 L, t26 eat at (1,6)? At t25 move to (1,6).\n\nt21: from (4,3) to (3,3)\n\nt22: to (3,4)\n\nt23: to (3,5)\n\nt24: to (3,6)\n\nt25: to (2,6)\n\nt26: to (1,6) and eat.\n\nBut at t26, (1,6) life span: at t21,8, so t22:7, t23:6, t24:5, t25:4, t26:3, still there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) at t25: countdown at t21:5, t25:1, present; after t25, gone, so last chance to eat is t25.\n\nIn the above path, at t25, I am at (2,6), moving to (1,6) at t26, so I don't eat (4,4) at all.\n\nI could eat (4,4) on the way.\n\nFor example, from current, at t21 move U to (4,4) eat, then at t22 from (4,4) move L to (3,4), then t23 to (3,5), t24 to (3,6), t25 to (2,6), t26 to (1,6) eat.\n\nSame number of moves, but I ate both foods.\n\nt21: move U to (4,4) eat, head at (4,4)\n\nt22: move L to (3,4)  // direction U, move L, allowed\n\nt23: move U to (3,5)  // now direction L, move U, allowed\n\nt24: move U to (3,6)  // direction U\n\nt25: move L to (2,6)  // direction U, move L, allowed\n\nt26: move L to (1,6) eat  // direction L, move L\n\nSo I eat both foods by t26.\n\nIf I don't eat at t21, and go directly to (1,6), I miss (4,4).\n\nBut I could eat (4,4) later.\n\nFor example, at t21 move L to (3,3)\n\nt22 move U to (3,4)\n\nt23 move R to (4,4) eat  // from (3,4) direction U, move R to (4,4)\n\nThen after eating, head at (4,4), direction R (since moved right)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,6), but (4,4) to (1,6) is |4-1| + |4-6| =3+2=5, but with body, need path.\n\nFrom (4,4) after eating, at t23.\n\nThen t24: from (4,4) direction R, can move U to (4,5), or D, or R to (5,4), but not L.\n\nTo go left, I need to change direction.\n\nSay t24 move U to (4,5)  // direction now U\n\nt25 move L to (3,5)  // direction U, move L allowed\n\nt26 move L to (2,5)  // direction L\n\nt27 move U to (2,6)  // direction L, move U allowed\n\nt28 move L to (1,6) eat  // direction U, move L\n\nBut at t28, (1,6) countdown at t21:8, t28: countdown? t21:8, t22:7, ..., t28:1, still there, after t28 gone.\n\nBut I ate at t28, while in the first path I ate at t26.\n\nIn this case, I ate (4,4) at t23, but (1,6) at t28.\n\nWhereas in the first path, both by t26.\n\nFirst path: eat (4,4) at t21, (1,6) at t26.\n\nSecond: eat (4,4) at t23, (1,6) at t28.\n\nBut in terms of score, same, but I have the point earlier, but survival same.\n\nHowever, in the second, I have a longer snake from t23 onwards, which might be riskier.\n\nBut in both cases, I get both foods.\n\nBut in the second path, when I go to eat (4,4) at t23 from (3,4), moving R to (4,4), is that safe?\n\nAt t23, before move, let's see the snake positions.\n\nIf at t21 move L to (3,3), no eat.\n\nAt t22 move U to (3,4), no eat.\n\nSnake positions at t22: after t21 move to (3,3), positions as earlier: (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nAt t22 move U to (3,4), no food, so head to (3,4), body: seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (4,2), seg4 to (4,1), seg5 to (5,1), seg6 to (6,1), seg7 to (6,2), tail to (6,3)? Similar.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is tail.\n\nNow at t23, move R to (4,4) to eat food.\n\n(4,4) has food, so move to (4,4), eat, grow.\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nBody: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (6,3) stays, so new tail segment at (6,3).\n\nPositions: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, head at (4,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nIs there any collision? No.\n\nBut now the snake is longer, 10 segments, and in a tight space.\n\nFrom here, to go to (1,6), I need to go left and up, but the body is blocking.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) or L, but direction R, so I can move U or D or R, not L (reverse).\n\nSo I can move U to (4,5), as I said earlier.\n\nThen from (4,5), direction U, I can move L to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut the path to (1,6) might be clear, but with longer snake, it might be harder to turn.\n\nIn the first approach, eating at t21, then going to (1,6) with shorter path, snake length 9 after t21.\n\nIn the first path: after t21 eat (4,4), length 9.\n\nThen go to (1,6) in 5 moves, by t26.\n\nIn the second, after t23 eat (4,4), length 10, then take more turns to (1,6).\n\nBut both possible.\n\nHowever, (1,6) life span allows until t28, so ok.\n\nBut to minimize risk, shorter snake is better.\n\nMoreover, if I eat (4,4) now, I have one point, and I can focus on (1,6).\n\nIf I don't eat, and go directly to (1,6), I might miss (4,4), but I can eat it on the way if I choose.\n\nBut in the direct path to (1,6), I don't pass (4,4), so I need to detour.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) at t21, instead of going up to (3,4), I could go to (4,4) but from (3,3), (4,4) is not adjacent, I need to go to (3,4) or (4,3) first, but (4,3) is occupied.\n\nAt t21 move L to (3,3), then at t22 I can move to (3,4) or (2,3) or (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), then at t23 to (4,4) as above.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) at t22, then I can go up to (2,4), etc, but then (4,4) is not on the way.\n\nSo to eat both, I need to include (4,4) in the path.\n\nTherefore, eating (4,4) at t21 seems efficient.\n\nNow, another consideration: the food at (4,4) might be under the body? No, currently (4,4) is not under snake, it's food position, free cell.\n\nThe rule says food can spawn under body, but here it's not, it's given as food position.\n\nIn this state, (4,4) is clear.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger not applicable.\n\nSo moving U to eat (4,4) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nBut let's confirm the head and tail.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4), head at (4,4), tail at (5,3) as per earlier.\n\nAre they adjacent? (4,4) and (5,3) are diagonally adjacent, not orthogonally, so not adjacent in the sense for Tail Reward Danger, which requires orthogonal adjacency.\n\nThe rule says \"adjacent\", which in grid usually means orthogonal, not diagonal.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating, I need to navigate to (1,6).\n\nWith head at (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nMoving L to (3,4) might be better to go left.\n\nBut direction is U, so I can move L.\n\nThen to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut there's the obstacle at (3,1), but it's not blocking the top path.\n\ny=6 is row 6.\n\n(3,6) to (1,6) is clear.\n\nAnother thing: the walls, but no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should output the action for turn 21.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns? The answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many to output.\n\nLooking back: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nBut it might be open-ended, but I think for the response, I should provide a sequence of actions for the next few turns, based on the plan.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut for now, at turn 21, I can decide to move U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan as above.\n\nTo be complete, let's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 21: Move U to (4,4) to eat food.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 22: Move L to (3,4)  // to go left towards (1,6), and since direction U, move L is allowed.\n\nNow direction changes to L.\n\nTurn 23: Move U to (3,5)  // direction L, move U allowed\n\nTurn 24: Move U to (3,6)  // now direction U\n\nTurn 25: Move L to (2,6)  // direction U, move L allowed\n\nTurn 26: Move L to (1,6) to eat the other food.\n\nAt turn 25, (4,4) food is gone, but we already ate it.\n\n(1,6) eaten at turn 26, countdown at t26: from t21:8, t26:3, present.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive, but no more food mentioned, so I can just avoid collisions.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize score, and no other food, eating both is good.\n\nIn this plan, I eat both.\n\nIf I don't eat at t21, I might not get (4,4).\n\nFor example, if I move L at t21 to (3,3), then I can still eat (4,4) at t23 as before, but then to (1,6) takes longer.\n\nIn that case, at t21 move L to (3,3)\n\nt22 move U to (3,4)\n\nt23 move R to (4,4) eat\n\nThen at t24 from (4,4) direction R, move U to (4,5)\n\nt25 move L to (3,5)\n\nt26 move U to (3,6)\n\nt27 move L to (2,6)\n\nt28 move L to (1,6) eat\n\nBut at t28, (1,6) is still there, countdown t28:1.\n\nBut I used more turns, and snake is longer earlier.\n\nWhereas in the first plan, I eat both by t26 with shorter path.\n\nSo the first plan is better.\n\nMoreover, in the first plan, after eating (4,4) at t21, the snake is at (4,4), which is higher, so I can go up easily.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle? At (3,1), which is bottom, not affecting top path.\n\nAlso, when I move to (3,4) at t22, is it safe?\n\nAfter t21 eat (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nAt t22 move L to (3,4): now (3,4) is free, not occupied.\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nBody: seg1 to (4,4) // previous head\n\nSeg2 to (4,3) // previous seg1\n\n... and so on, down to tail.\n\nSince no eat, tail moves: the last segment (5,3) is removed? No.\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0:(4,4), 1:(4,3), 2:(4,2), 3:(4,1), 4:(5,1), 5:(6,1), 6:(6,2), 7:(6,3), 8:(5,3) // tail\n\nAfter move to (3,4) no food:\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nThen seg1: (4,4) // from prev index 0\n\nSeg2: (4,3) // from prev index 1\n\nSeg3: (4,2) // from prev index 2\n\nSeg4: (4,1) // from prev index 3\n\nSeg5: (5,1) // from prev index 4\n\nSeg6: (6,1) // from prev index 5\n\nSeg7: (6,2) // from prev index 6\n\nSeg8: (6,3) // from prev index 7\n\nPrev index 8 (5,3) is removed, new tail is (6,3)\n\nSo positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nAll good.\n\nThen continue as planned.\n\nNow, at turn 25, move L to (2,6), from (3,6) direction U, move L to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) should be free.\n\nThen turn 26 move L to (1,6) eat.\n\n(1,6) is free, no issue.\n\nAfter that, no food, but I need to survive.\n\nFor example, from (1,6), I can move down or right, but not left or up since walls.\n\nBut since no more food, I can just move safely.\n\nBut for the answer, I think providing up to eating both foods is fine.\n\nThe output should start from turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 26 I eat the second food.\n\nBut the actions are for movement.\n\nNow, for turn 21, I think moving U is best.\n\nBut earlier I considered moving R or L, but that seems worse.\n\nFor example, if I move R to (5,3) at t21, then I am at (5,3), and to go to (4,4) I need to move U to (5,4), then L to (4,4), but at t22.\n\nBut at t22, from (5,3) move U to (5,4), then at t23 move L to (4,4), but (4,4) might be gone if I delay, but it has until t25.\n\nBut then I start from right, harder to go left.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (3,3) at t21, then to (3,4) then to (4,4) at t23, as before.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat (4,4) later and take more turns for (1,6).\n\nWhereas moving U at t21 allows me to eat immediately and set a direct path.\n\nTherefore, for turn 21, action should be U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can define the plan.\n\nSince the answer format might expect only the current turn, but it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut how many? I think 5 or 6 turns.\n\nSince I planned to t26, but t26 is turn 21+5, so 5 turns ahead.\n\nt21 to t26 is 6 actions: t21, t22, t23, t24, t25, t26.\n\nBut at t26 I move to (1,6), which is the last action in the plan.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, at some points, I need to ensure no reverse.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 21: Move U to (4,4) eat, direction now U\n\nTurn 22: Move L to (3,4) // from (4,4) to (3,4), moving left, direction changes to L\n\nTurn 23: Move U to (3,5) // from (3,4) to (3,5), moving up, direction changes to U\n\nTurn 24: Move U to (3,6) // from (3,5) to (3,6), moving up, direction U\n\nTurn 25: Move L to (2,6) // from (3,6) to (2,6), moving left, direction changes to L? After moving L, direction is L.\n\nAt turn 24, after move to (3,6), direction is U (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 25, move L to (2,6), which is left, not reverse, so allowed, direction now L.\n\nTurn 26: Move L to (1,6) // from (2,6) to (1,6), moving left, direction L.\n\nAll good.\n\nAfter that, I can stop or continue, but since no more food, it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output turns 21 to 26.\n\nBut turn 26 is t1+5, since t1=21, t1+5=26.\n\nt1=21, t1+1=22, ..., up to t1+5=26.\n\nNow, about the life span: (4,4) eaten at t21, (1,6) at t26, both within life span.\n\n(1,6) at t26, countdown from t21:8, t26:3 (since t21:8, t22:7, t23:6, t24:5, t25:4, t26:3), so yes.\n\nIn the state, food has value and life span, both 1, so positive.\n\nNow, I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must consider the current state and plan multiple turns ahead. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,4) quickly, as it has a short life span (countdown 5 at turn 21, disappearing after turn 25).\n- Navigate to the positive food at (1,6) with a longer life span (countdown 8 at turn 21, disappearing after turn 28) after securing (4,4).\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body, and adhere to movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 21)\n- **Snake position**: Head at (4,3), moving up (U). Body segments: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] (length 8).\n- **Food**: \n  - (4,4): Value +1, life span 5 (eatable on turns 21-25).\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 8 (eatable on turns 21-28).\n- **Walls and obstacles**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (3,1). Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6 except (3,1).\n- **Immediate moves**: Current direction U, so cannot move D (reverse). Possible moves:\n  - U to (4,4): Eats food (+1 score, length increases to 9), safe (no collision; tail at (5,3) not adjacent orthogonally).\n  - L to (3,3): No food, safe.\n  - R to (5,3): No food, safe (moving to tail is safe as tail moves away).\n- **Why eat (4,4) now?**\n  - It is adjacent and can be eaten immediately, securing +1 before it expires.\n  - Delaying risks missing it due to short life span (only 4 chances left after turn 21).\n  - Eating now allows a direct path to (1,6) with minimal turns, keeping the snake shorter longer for better maneuverability.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns Ahead)\n- **Goal**: Eat both foods while avoiding dead ends. After turn 26, focus on survival as no more food is present.\n- **Path to (1,6)**:\n  - From (4,4), move left to (3,4) to start heading west.\n  - Then move up to (3,5), (3,6) to reach the top row.\n  - Finally, move left to (2,6) and (1,6) to eat the second food.\n- **Turn-by-turn rationale**:\n  - **Turn 21 (now)**: Move U to eat (4,4). Secures +1 early, head now at (4,4) with direction U.\n  - **Turn 22**: Move L to (3,4). Changes direction to L; no food, but positions for west movement.\n  - **Turn 23**: Move U to (3,5). Changes direction to U; no food, continues upward path.\n  - **Turn 24**: Move U to (3,6). Direction U; reaches top row, no food.\n  - **Turn 25**: Move L to (2,6). Changes direction to L; no food, approaches (1,6).\n  - **Turn 26**: Move L to (1,6) to eat the food. Direction L; secures +1, countdown at turn 26 is 3 (safe).\n- **Survival after turn 26**: With both foods eaten and no more rewards, move safely (e.g., down or right from (1,6)) to avoid collisions.\n\n### Risks Mitigated\n- **Collisions**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body. For example:\n  - At turn 22, (3,4) is free (not body or obstacle).\n  - At turn 26, (1,6) is free and within bounds.\n- **Reverse moves**: Direction changes respect no-instant-reverse (e.g., from U to L at turn 22 is allowed).\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not triggered—eating (4,4) at turn 21: head (4,3) and tail (5,3) are adjacent, but (5,3) has no food. Eating (1,6) at turn 26: no adjacency with tail.\n- **Life spans**: (4,4) eaten on turn 21 (countdown 5), (1,6) on turn 26 (countdown 3), both within limits.\n- **Efficiency**: This path eats both foods in 6 turns with minimal snake growth delay, reducing entanglement risks in the small grid (35 playable cells, snake length 9 after turn 21).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: L\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: L\nTurn 26: L\n}",

        "step": 22,
        "score": 8,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), because x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, and y from 1 to 6. Let me confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n\nThere's also an internal obstacle at (3,1). So that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So that's 9 segments. Head at (4,4), direction is Up, which makes sense since it's moving from (4,3) to (4,4)? Positions are given head first: [(4,4), (4,3), ...] so head is at (4,4), and the previous position was (4,3), so since it moved to (4,4) from (4,3), that was an upward move, and current direction is U, which is consistent.\n\nFood: two items.\n\nFirst food: (1,6) with life span 7 and value 1. Value 1 is positive food.\n\nSecond food: (1,1) with life span 10 and value 1, also positive.\n\nBoth are positive, no negative food here. Value 1, so +1 point and length increases.\n\nLife span: for (1,6), life span 7 at turn 22, so it disappears after turn 22 + 7 - 1? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t + L? Or at the end?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if at turn t, life span is L, then after this turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears.\n\nTypically, at turn t, with life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t, life span becomes L-1; if L-1 >0, it stays, else disappears.\n\nBut for movement, when we move, we eat food if head moves to it.\n\nNow, current turn is 22.\n\nFood at (1,6): life span 7, so it will last until turn 22 + 7 - 1? Let's think.\n\nAt turn 22, life span is 7. After turn 22, it decreases to 6. It will be gone after turn 22 + 7 = turn 29? Or after turn 28?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it exists for N turns starting from now.\n\nBut \"countdown decreases every turn including current\" suggests that during turn t, it has life span L, and after turn t, it becomes L-1.\n\nSo for eating: if head moves to food cell during a turn, it eats it.\n\nThe food is present as long as life span >0 at the start of the turn? I think we need to clarify.\n\nAssume that at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present during turn t. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. If new life span is 0, it disappears; else, it stays with reduced life span.\n\nSo for (1,6) at turn 22: life span 7, so present turns 22,23,24,25,26,27,28. After turn 28, life span becomes 0, so gone by turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 10, present turns 22 to 31, gone turn 32.\n\nBoth positive, so good to eat.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo cells: let's list free cells.\n\nBut snake occupies some: positions: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo: (4,4) head, (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is the tail? Let's see the order: head first, so tail is last: (5,3).\n\nNow, direction is U, so current movement is up.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, I cannot move D next, because that would be opposite.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) and (1,1).\n\n(1,6) is top-left, y=6 is top? y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row, but since walls, playable y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards?\n\nIn the positions, snake has (4,4), (4,3), etc., and head direction U, which is (x,y+1), so U increases y, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nSo (1,6) is top-left corner, (1,1) is bottom-left corner.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), which is bottom row, x=3, y=1.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,4).\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's find a path to food.\n\nBut there are two foods, both positive.\n\n(1,1) is closer to current position? Distance: from (4,4) to (1,1): |4-1| + |4-1| = 3+3=6 Manhattan.\n\nTo (1,6): |4-1| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 =5, so (1,6) is closer.\n\nBut (1,6) has shorter life span, only 7 turns, so it might disappear sooner, but 7 turns from now, turn 22 to 28, so we have until turn 28 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has life span 10, so more time.\n\nBut since both are positive, and we want to maximize score, we should eat both eventually, but need to survive.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 9 segments, so the board might be getting crowded.\n\nFree cells: total cells 6x6=36, minus walls but walls are borders, so 36 cells minus the internal obstacle, so 35 cells, but snake occupies 9, so 26 free cells? Let's list.\n\nCells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1)\n\nSnake: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is occupied, but it's the tail.\n\nNow, tail is at (5,3), and when snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves, so that cell is freed.\n\nSimilarly, head moves to new position.\n\nBut for now, occupied cells.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) and (1,1), which are not occupied by snake, so they are free except for food.\n\n(1,1) is a cell, but snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) at bottom, but (1,1) is free, since not listed in snake positions.\n\nSnake positions are only those listed, so (1,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) free.\n\nBut (1,1) has food, so it's occupied by food, but when we say free, meaning not wall or snake, but food can be eaten.\n\nFor movement, we can move to food cells to eat them.\n\nBut in terms of space, the cell is available if not wall or snake body.\n\nFood cells are available for head to move to, to eat.\n\nBut if there's food under body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in, but here no food under body.\n\n(1,1) is not occupied by snake, similarly (1,6).\n\nSo both are accessible.\n\nNow, let's see the current position.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R. (not D, reverse forbidden)\n\nIf move U: to (4,5)\n\nIs (4,5) safe? Not wall, not snake body? Snake body: positions are (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). (4,4) is head, which will move away.\n\n(4,5) is not in body, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, L: to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) : x=3,y=4, not wall, not in snake body? Body: (4,3), (4,2), etc., no (3,4), so safe.\n\nR: to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) not in body, not wall, safe.\n\nNow, but we need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, tail at (5,3), and head is at (4,4), which is adjacent? (4,4) and (5,3) are diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n\n(4,4) to (5,3): |4-5|=1, |4-3|=1, so not adjacent; adjacent would be like (4,4) to (4,3) or (4,5) or (3,4) or (5,4).\n\nSo head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nBut there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, no food on tail, so not an issue now.\n\nNow, let's plan to get to food.\n\nFirst, to (1,6): from (4,4), we can go left and up.\n\nSimilarly to (1,1): down and left.\n\nBut (1,1) is bottom-left, and there's obstacle at (3,1), so from (4,4) to (1,1), we need to go left and down.\n\nBut snake body is at bottom row: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and (6,2), (6,3), so bottom row is partially blocked.\n\nAlso, (3,1) is obstacle, so (1,1) might be tricky to reach directly.\n\nPath to (1,6): from (4,4), we can go to (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6). Or other paths.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,1): from (4,4), down to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, so cannot go there directly.\n\n(4,3) is occupied, so from (4,4), if I go D to (4,3), that's body, collision, die.\n\nSo cannot move down to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, cannot move to any body cell except tail under certain conditions, but tail is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (4,4), tail at (5,3), not adjacent, so moving to tail is possible only if head moves to it, but tail will move away when snake moves, so it's safe to move to tail position as long as no other body part.\n\nGeneral rule: moving to the current tail position is safe because when the snake moves, the tail moves first, freeing the cell, then head moves to new position, but since tail moves, the cell is empty when head moves, but if head moves to the tail cell, it should be ok, because tail has moved.\n\nThe rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo yes, moving to tail position is safe.\n\nBut here, tail is at (5,3), head at (4,4), not the same, and not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nNow back to moves.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nU: to (4,5)\n\nL: to (3,4)\n\nR: to (5,4)\n\nNow, let's think about the food.\n\n(1,6) has shorter life span, only 7 turns, from turn 22 to 28, so we have about 6 turns to eat it (since at turn 22, we can eat it now if we move there, but we are not there yet).\n\nAt turn 22, we move the head, so if we can reach (1,6) in a few moves, we might eat it.\n\nBut from (4,4) to (1,6) is at least 5 moves? Manhattan distance 5, but with obstacles, but no direct obstacles, so we can go directly.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4), then L to (2,4), then L to (1,4), then U to (1,5), then U to (1,6). That's 4 moves from now: after move 1: (3,4), move 2: (2,4), move 3: (1,4), move 4: (1,5), move 5: (1,6). So on turn 5 from now, turn 26, we can be at (1,6).\n\nLife span of (1,6) is 7 at turn 22, so at turn 22: life span 7, present; turn 23:6, turn24:5, turn25:4, turn26:3, turn27:2, turn28:1, gone after turn28. So at turn 26, it should be present, life span 3? At start of turn 26, life span is 7 - (26-22) = 5? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 22: life span L=7\n\nAfter turn 22: L=6, present for turn 23\n\nAfter turn 23: L=5, present turn 24\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 27: L=1, present turn 28\n\nAfter turn 28: L=0, gone for turn 29.\n\nSo (1,6) is present from turn 22 to turn 28 inclusive.\n\nTurn 28 is the last turn it can be eaten.\n\nWe can reach by turn 26, which is before 28, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,1): life span 10, present until turn 31, so more time.\n\nNow, but after eating (1,6), we need to think where to go next.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, so we need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (1,6).\n\nBut is it safe? Let's simulate the moves.\n\nCurrent turn 22, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), that might be good for going left.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nList all occupied cells to avoid.\n\nSnake: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nAlso, tail at (5,3), when we move, if not eating, tail moves, so the new position will free the tail cell.\n\nBut for now, when moving, we need to check the target cell.\n\nNow, from (4,4), move L to (3,4): (3,4) is free? Yes, not wall, not snake.\n\nThen, after move, head at (3,4), tail moves? When we move, the snake: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail at (5,3) moves to where the second last was, but second last is (6,3)? Positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,3), 8: tail (5,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4), the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to where head was (4,4), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was (4,3), and so on, up to segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was (6,3). Segment 7 is (6,3), so segment 8 (tail) moves to (6,3), and the old tail (5,3) is freed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — tail at (6,3).\n\nDirection: we moved left, so new direction is L.\n\nNow, at (3,4), we can move to (1,6) via left and up.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): since direction L, we can move L, U, D (not R, reverse).\n\nL to (2,4), U to (3,5), D to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) free, (3,5) free.\n\nThen we can go L to (2,4), then L to (1,4), then U to (1,5), then U to (1,6).\n\nAt turn 22: move L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 23: from (3,4), move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 24: from (2,4), move L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 25: from (1,4), move U to (1,5) — direction now L, moving U, so new direction U.\n\nTurn 26: from (1,5), move U to (1,6), eat food, length increases to 10.\n\nNow, on turn 26, we eat at (1,6), so tail doesn't move, we grow.\n\nNow, after that, we are at (1,6), with new head position, and tail still at previous position.\n\nPositions before turn 26: at start of turn 26, head at (1,5), body: after turn 25.\n\nLet's track positions.\n\nTurn 22 start: snake: H(4,4), B1(4,3), B2(4,2), B3(4,1), B4(5,1), B5(6,1), B6(6,2), B7(6,3), T(5,3)\n\nAfter move L: head to (3,4), B1 to (4,4), B2 to (4,3), B3 to (4,2), B4 to (4,1), B5 to (5,1), B6 to (6,1), B7 to (6,2), T to (6,3)  // since B7 was (6,3)? B7 is (6,3), T moves to B7 position.\n\nPositions: after turn 22 move: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: move L from (3,4) to (2,4)\n\nNew head (2,4), B1 to (3,4), B2 to (4,4), B3 to (4,3), B4 to (4,2), B5 to (4,1), B6 to (5,1), B7 to (6,1), T to (6,2)  // T moves to where B7 was, (6,2)? B7 was (6,2)? After turn 22, B7 is (6,2), so T moves to (6,2).\n\nList: after turn 22: positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] head to tail.\n\nAfter turn 23 move L to (2,4): head (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail at (6,2), since (6,3) is freed.\n\nTurn 24: move L to (1,4) from (2,4)\n\nHead (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail at (6,1)\n\nTurn 25: move U to (1,5) from (1,4) — direction now? From (1,4), moving U, so direction U.\n\nHead (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // tail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (1,6), eat food. Since we eat, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail remains (5,1) but since we grow, we add a segment, so tail is now (4,1)? Positions: head (1,6), body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so tail becomes (4,1), but (4,1) was already there? No.\n\nBefore eating, positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (5,1)\n\nAfter moving to (1,6) and eating: head to (1,6), and we add a new segment at the position where tail was, so the tail doesn't move, and we add a new segment there.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and new segment at (5,1) — so now tail is at (5,1).\n\nLength 10.\n\nNow, head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nBut (1,6) is top-left corner, and we need to get out without trapping ourselves.\n\nPossible moves from (1,6): since direction U, we can move U, L, R? But U would be to (1,7), which is y=7 wall, so cannot move up.\n\nL to (0,6) x=0 wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,6), which is possible, or D to (1,5), but direction U, moving D is reverse, forbidden? Current direction is U, moving D is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves: L and R, but L to (0,6) wall, so only R to (2,6).\n\nMust move R to (2,6).\n\nThen from there, we can go to other places.\n\nBut we have another food at (1,1), which is bottom-left.\n\nNow, (1,1) has life span 10, so until turn 31, but we are at turn 26, so plenty of time.\n\nBut from (1,6), after moving to (2,6), we need to go down to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is at bottom, and there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, the snake body is now spread, but we have segments at (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), etc., so left side is partially blocked.\n\nAfter turn 26, positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (5,1)\n\n(4,1) and (5,1) are occupied, and (1,1) is free but with food.\n\nTo reach (1,1), we need to go to (1,5) or something, but (1,5) is occupied.\n\nFrom (2,6), we can move down to (2,5), etc., but to get to (1,1), we might need to go around.\n\nSince the snake is long, moving down the left side might be tight.\n\nAnother option: instead of going directly to (1,6) first, perhaps go to (1,1) first, since it has more life span.\n\nBut (1,6) has shorter life span, so we should prioritize it.\n\nBut let's see if we can get to (1,1) faster or not.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (1,1): |dx|=3, |dy|=3, Manhattan 6.\n\nBut with obstacle at (3,1), and body at bottom.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4), then D to (3,3)? But direction.\n\nAt turn 22, from (4,4), if we move L to (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 23, from (3,4), we can move D to (3,3), since not reverse (L to D is not opposite).\n\nThen from (3,3), to (2,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nBut to (1,1), from (3,3), we can go to (2,3), (1,3), then (1,2), (1,1), but (1,2) and (1,3) might be free.\n\nBut there's obstacle at (3,1), so we cannot go directly down from (3,3) to (3,2) if we want to go to (1,1), but (3,2) is free? Let's see.\n\nCells: (1,1) food, (3,1) obstacle, so (2,1) should be free, (1,2) free, etc.\n\nBut snake body: at bottom, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) occupied, and (4,2) etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is free, (1,2) free.\n\nSo from (3,3), move L to (2,3), then L to (1,3), then D to (1,2), then D to (1,1).\n\nThat's 4 moves from (3,3), which is turn 23 position, so turns 23 to 26: at turn 23 we are at (3,4)? Start from turn 22.\n\nTurn 22: move L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 23: move D to (3,3) — direction L, moving D, ok.\n\nTurn 24: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 25: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 26: move D to (1,2) — direction L, moving D, ok.\n\nTurn 27: move D to (1,1), eat.\n\nBut at turn 27, (1,1) life span: at turn 22 L=10, turn 23 L=9, ..., turn 27 L=5, still present.\n\nBut we wanted to eat (1,6) first because it has shorter life.\n\nIf we go to (1,1) first, by turn 27, but (1,6) might disappear by turn 28, but we can go after.\n\nBut let's compare.\n\nIf we go to (1,1) by turn 27, then from there, to (1,6) is far, and (1,6) might be gone by turn 28.\n\nTurn 27 is before turn 28, so (1,6) still present at turn 27.\n\nBut from (1,1) to (1,6) is |dy|=5, so at least 5 moves, but we are at (1,1) after turn 27, so turn 28 we can start moving up, but (1,6) is present until turn 28, so at turn 28, if we move to (1,6), we can eat it.\n\nAfter eating (1,1) at turn 27, head at (1,1), direction D? Moved D to (1,1), so direction D.\n\nThen turn 28: from (1,1), possible moves: since direction D, can move D, L, R? D to (1,0) wall, not possible; L to (0,1) wall; R to (2,1), or U to (1,2) but U is opposite to D? Direction is D, moving U is reverse, forbidden.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), we can move U to (2,2), etc., but to (1,6) it's far, and we cannot go directly to (1,6) because left column is blocked by snake body.\n\nAfter turn 27: after eating (1,1), positions: head (1,1), body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail at (4,1) or something—let's not trace, but point is, (1,2) and (1,3) are occupied, so we cannot go up from (1,1) directly to (1,2) because it's body.\n\nIn fact, from (1,1), only move is R to (2,1), then from there we can go up, but to reach (1,6) by turn 28 is impossible because it's 5 cells away, and we are at (2,1) on turn 28, (1,6) is at turn 28, but we are not there, so we miss (1,6).\n\nAt turn 28, if we are at (2,1), we cannot reach (1,6) in one move.\n\nSo (1,6) disappears after turn 28, uneaten.\n\nTherefore, if we go to (1,1) first, we miss (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is positive, we want to eat it.\n\nSo better to go to (1,6) first, as I thought earlier.\n\nThen, after eating (1,6) at turn 26, we are at (1,6) and must move R to (2,6) on turn 27.\n\nThen from (2,6), we can move down to (2,5), etc.\n\nNow, we have (1,1) to eat, with life span until turn 31.\n\nSo from (2,6), we can go down the right side or left side.\n\nBut left side has snake body: from positions after turn 26: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (5,1)\n\nSo (1,4), (1,5) occupied, (1,3) free, (1,2) free, (1,1) food.\n\n(2,4) occupied, etc.\n\nTo reach (1,1), we need to go to (1,3) or (1,2).\n\nBut from (2,6), after moving to (2,6) on turn 27.\n\nTurn 26: head (1,6), direction U (since last move U to (1,6))\n\nTurn 27: must move R to (2,6), direction now R.\n\nThen from (2,6), possible moves: R to (3,6), U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) but (1,6) is where we came from, and it might be body? After move to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail at (4,1)? After eating at turn 26, positions: head (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nAfter turn 27 move R to (2,6): head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail at (4,1), and (5,1) is freed? When we move without eating, tail moves: from previous, tail (5,1) moves to where the second last was, which is (4,1)? Positions before turn 27: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (5,1)\n\nAfter move head to (2,6): new head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // and tail (5,1) is not part, since we moved, tail moved to (4,1)? The last body segment moves to (4,1), and the old tail (5,1) is freed.\n\nSo positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] head to tail, length 10.\n\nTail at (4,1).\n\nNow from (2,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R to (3,6), D to (2,5), L to (1,6) but (1,6) is now body, occupied, cannot move there.\n\nU to (2,7) wall, not possible.\n\nSo only R to (3,6) or D to (2,5).\n\n(3,6) is free, not wall, not occupied.\n\n(2,5) is free? (2,5) not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nNow, to go to (1,1), we need to go down.\n\nMove D to (2,5) might be better.\n\nThen from (2,5), we can move D to (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied now? After above, (2,4) is body, so cannot.\n\nFrom (2,5), we can move L to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, occupied.\n\nOr R to (3,5), or D to (2,4) but occupied.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5): if we move there.\n\nBut (2,4) is occupied, so from (2,5), moving D to (2,4) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,5) collision.\n\nSo only R to (3,5) or U to (2,6) but U is reverse? Direction from (2,6) to (2,5) is D, so if we move to (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen from (2,5), moves: D to (2,4) but occupied, L to (1,5) occupied, U to (2,6) but U is opposite to D, forbidden, R to (3,5).\n\nSo only possible move is R to (3,5).\n\nThen we are at (3,5), and so on, but we are moving away from (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,6), better to move R to (3,6).\n\nThen from (3,6), we can move down to (3,5), etc., and then go around to the right or bottom.\n\nBut to reach (1,1), it might be difficult with the body in the way.\n\nSince the snake is long, we need to circle around to free up space.\n\nAnother idea: from the beginning, instead of going directly left to (1,6), perhaps go down or right first to clear space, but that might take more time, and (1,6) could expire.\n\nBut let's see the current state at turn 22.\n\nHead at (4,4), with body below and right.\n\nThe area near (1,1) has the obstacle at (3,1), and snake at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), so (1,1) can be reached from above or right, but (2,1) is free.\n\nBut from (4,4), if we go down, but we cannot because (4,3) is body.\n\nMove R to (5,4), then down or something.\n\nBut let's think about long-term survival.\n\nPerhaps we should eat (1,6) first as planned, then after moving to (2,6), instead of going down, go right to (3,6), then down to (3,5), (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied? After turn 27, if we are at (2,6), move R to (3,6).\n\nAt turn 27: positions as above, head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nMove R to (3,6): head (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail at (4,2), (4,1) freed? Tail moved to (4,2).\n\nThen from (3,6), direction R, move D to (3,5) for example.\n\nBut (3,5) free.\n\nThen we can continue down to (3,4), but (3,4) is now body? In the positions, after move, (3,4) is part of body, so at (3,5), moving D to (3,4) would be collision.\n\nSo from (3,5), we need to move L or R.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nTo eat (1,1), we need to approach it from the right or above when the path is clear.\n\nSince (1,1) has more life span, we can eat it later after clearing the left side.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the board has 35 cells, snake length 10 after eating one food, so 25 free, but we can survive.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 22, instead of going left, go right to (5,4).\n\nThen from there, we can go down or up.\n\nBut (1,6) might be missed.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) move R to (5,4), then R to (6,4), but (6,4) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nThen from (6,4), we can go U to (6,5), etc., but to (1,6) it's far, and life span short.\n\nWe might not reach in time.\n\nManhattan distance from (6,4) to (1,6) is 5+2=7, at least 7 moves, but by turn 28, we have 6 moves from turn 22: turn 23 to 28 is 6 turns, but turn 22 is current, turn 23 move, etc., to move 6 times by turn 27, position at turn 28.\n\nAt turn 22 start, we move.\n\nTurn 22: move to say (5,4)\n\nTurn 23: to (6,4)\n\nTurn 24: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 25: to (6,6)\n\nTurn 26: to (5,6) or (6,6) to (5,6)\n\n(6,6) is corner, then to (5,6), then (4,6), etc., to (1,6) would take many moves, not possible by turn 28.\n\nSo only way to eat (1,6) is to go left from current position.\n\nSo I think the initial plan to go to (1,6) via left moves is best.\n\nThen after eating it, at (1,6), move R to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), to reach (1,1), we can go down the column, but column 1 has body at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), so we need to wait for the body to move away.\n\nSince we are moving, the snake will crawl, so cells will free up.\n\nFor example, after turn 27, at (2,6), if we move D to (2,5), but earlier I saw that from (2,5), we can only move R to (3,5), because other moves blocked.\n\nAt (2,6), move D to (2,5).\n\nIs (2,5) free? Yes.\n\nThen from (2,5), direction D.\n\nNow possible moves: U to (2,6) but reverse, forbidden; D to (2,4) but (2,4) is occupied (in body); L to (1,5) occupied; R to (3,5) free.\n\nSo only R to (3,5).\n\nThen to (3,5), direction R (since moved from (2,5) to (3,5)? From (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen from (3,5), moves: U to (3,6) possible, D to (3,4) but (3,4) occupied, L to (2,5) but reverse if direction R, moving L opposite, forbidden; R to (4,5) free.\n\nSo only U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf U to (3,6), but (3,6) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3) or something.\n\nLet's not.\n\nPoint is, we are moving right, away from (1,1).\n\nTo reach (1,1), we need to go down to row 1.\n\nSince column 1 is blocked, we can go to column 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), move R to (3,6), then down to (3,5), (3,4) but (3,4) occupied, so move to (4,5) or something.\n\nThen eventually to the bottom.\n\nBut at bottom, (1,1) is there, and we can approach from (2,1) or (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) and (2,1) should be free at some point.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) will move down as we crawl.\n\nFor example, in the first plan, after eating (1,6) at turn 26, we move R to (2,6) at turn 27.\n\nThen at turn 27, positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\n(1,4) and (1,5) are body.\n\nIf we move D to (2,5) at turn 27 from (2,6).\n\nTurn 27: from (2,6) move D to (2,5)\n\nNew head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail at (4,2), (4,1) freed.\n\nNow at (2,5), only move R to (3,5) as before.\n\nMove to (3,5): head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)  // tail (4,3)\n\nFrom (3,5), move R to (4,5) for example.\n\nThen to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMeanwhile, the body is moving, so (1,4) will move to (2,4) or something, but in this case, (1,4) is moving right, so eventually the left column frees up.\n\nFor example, after a few moves, (1,4) will be vacated.\n\nThen we can go to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince we have until turn 31 for (1,1), we can do that.\n\nBut to maximize score, we might eat both, but no more food now, so after eating both, we need to survive.\n\nBut let's focus on the first few turns.\n\nBack to turn 22.\n\nI think for turn 22, moving L to (3,4) is best to head towards (1,6).\n\nThen subsequent moves as planned.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output multiple turns: at least 5 turns ahead, so for turns 22,23,24,25,26, etc.\n\nThe format is for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nCurrent turn t1=22.\n\nSo for turn 22: action\n\nTurn 23: action\n\netc.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the state may change after each move, especially if we eat food, but here no food on the way to (1,6) except at the end.\n\nIn the path I described, no food until (1,6).\n\nSo for turn 22: move L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 23: from (3,4), move L to (2,4)  // direction L, moving L ok\n\nTurn 24: from (2,4), move L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 25: from (1,4), move U to (1,5)  // direction L, moving U ok\n\nTurn 26: from (1,5), move U to (1,6)  // eat food\n\nThen turn 27: from (1,6), must move R to (2,6)\n\nThen from there, to go to (1,1), we need to go down.\n\nBut at (2,6), if we move D to (2,5), then we are stuck to move only right, as before.\n\nBut we can move R to (3,6) instead.\n\nAt (2,6), move R to (3,6)\n\nThen from (3,6), we can move D to (3,5)\n\nThen from (3,5), we can move D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, so cannot; or move R to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) might be free later.\n\nTo reach (1,1), we can go to (3,5), then to (3,4) when free, but not now.\n\nSince (1,1) is at bottom, and we have time, we can move to the right and down to the bottom row, then left to (1,1).\n\nFor example, from (3,6), move R to (4,6), then D to (4,5), (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, so to (5,5) or something.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (1,6), at turn 27 move to (2,6), then instead of moving down or right, move D to (2,5) if possible, but from (2,5) we can only move R.\n\nBut let's accept that and move to the center.\n\nThen from (3,5), move R to (4,5), then D to (4,4) but occupied, so to (5,5), etc.\n\nEventually, the body will move, and we can go down to row 1.\n\nFor example, at some point, (4,1) will be tail and move, freeing cells.\n\nSince (1,1) has life span 10, at turn 22, so by turn 32 it disappears, but we have until turn 31 to eat it.\n\nAt turn 26 we are at (1,6), turn 27 at (2,6), turn 28 at (3,6) if we move R, then from (3,6) move D to (3,5) turn 29, then to (4,5) turn 30, then to (5,5) turn 31, etc., not reaching (1,1) soon.\n\nBut we can go down faster.\n\nFrom (2,6), move D to (2,5) turn 27, then R to (3,5) turn 28, then from (3,5), move D to (3,4) but occupied, so instead move to (3,5) to (4,5) turn 28, then to (4,4) but occupied, so to (5,5) turn 29, not helping.\n\nPerhaps from (2,6), move D to (2,5), then from (2,5) we have to move R to (3,5), but at (3,5), we can move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5), but not down.\n\nSo we are stuck in the top rows.\n\nTo go down, we need to move to a column where the row below is free.\n\nFor example, at turn 27, at (2,6), instead of moving D or R, but we have to move one of them.\n\nMove R to (3,6).\n\nThen at (3,6), move D to (3,5).\n\nAt (3,5), if (3,4) is occupied, move R to (4,5) if free.\n\n(4,5) is free? In positions, after turn 27 move to (3,6): head (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail (4,2)\n\n(3,4) and (4,4) occupied, so (4,5) is free.\n\nSo move to (4,5): head (4,5), then (3,6), (2,6), etc.\n\nThen from (4,5), we can move D to (4,4) but occupied, or U to (4,6), or L to (3,5), or R to (5,5).\n\nSay move R to (5,5).\n\nThen to (5,5), and so on.\n\nBut to reach row 1, we can go to x=5 or 6.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) move D to (5,4), then to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) might be free later.\n\nSince we have time, we can eventually reach (1,1) by going around.\n\nBut let's not plan all turns, as the output requires actions for several turns, but it can be up to the point we eat or something.\n\nFor the answer, I can output the sequence to eat the first food.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can indicate the direction.\n\nSince the question is to output for turn 22,23,etc., I need to specify actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 22 to 26 as above.\n\nThen for turn 27, move R to (2,6), but that's after.\n\nBut let's see if there's a better initial move.\n\nAnother possibility: at turn 22, move U to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), we can go to (4,6) or (3,5), etc., but to (1,6) it's not direct.\n\nFor example, move U to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then L to (2,5), etc., to (1,5), then U to (1,6), but it takes more moves: turn 22 U to (4,5), turn 23 L to (3,5), turn 24 L to (2,5), turn 25 L to (1,5), turn 26 U to (1,6), same as before, but we went via (4,5) instead of (3,4), same number of moves.\n\nBut in this case, from (4,4) move U to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) is free, then to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut at (1,5), we move U to (1,6), but in the first plan, we went to (1,4) then U to (1,5) then U to (1,6), similar.\n\nBut in the first plan, we were at (1,4) at turn 24, then U to (1,5) turn 25, U to (1,6) turn 26.\n\nIn this alternative, at (4,5) turn 22, (3,5) turn 23, (2,5) turn 24, (1,5) turn 25, (1,6) turn 26, same.\n\nBut moving U first might not be better, and we have the internal obstacle below, but no issue.\n\nBut moving L directly is fine.\n\nI think L is good.\n\nSo for turn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: L\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nThen for turn 27, from (1,6) move R to (2,6)\n\nBut I need to output 5 turns or more.\n\nThe answer format says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output can be for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps output from turn 22 to 26 or 27.\n\nBut turn 27 is not fixed yet.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output the sequence for the first food.\n\nThen for the next, it depends.\n\nBut to be complete, let's assume we move as above.\n\nAlso, for the \"Tail Reward Danger\", not applicable here.\n\nSo I think for turn 22: L\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction U, move L, so new direction L.\n\nThen turn 23: from (3,4), direction L, move L to (2,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 24: from (2,4), direction L, move L to (1,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 25: from (1,4), direction L, move U to (1,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 26: from (1,5), direction U, move U to (1,6), direction U, eat.\n\nThen turn 27: from (1,6), direction U, must move R to (2,6), direction R.\n\nI can output up to turn 27.\n\nBut turn 27 is t1+5? t1=22, t1+5=27.\n\nSo 5 turns ahead from t1.\n\nt1=22, so turns 22,23,24,25,26,27? That's 6 actions.\n\nFrom turn 22 to 27 inclusive is 6 turns.\n\nBut \"5+ turns ahead\" might mean plan for at least 5 future states.\n\nOutput can be for several turns.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list multiple.\n\nFor this, I'll list turns 22 to 27.\n\nBut for turn 27, it's after eating, and we move R.\n\nNow, to be safe, let's make sure that during the path, no collision.\n\nIn the moves: turn 22 to (3,4) free.\n\nTurn 23 to (2,4) free.\n\nTurn 24 to (1,4) free.\n\nTurn 25 to (1,5) free.\n\nTurn 26 to (1,6) eat.\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen turn 27 to (2,6) free.\n\nNo issues.\n\nAfter that, we can go to (1,1) later.\n\nBut for the output, I think this is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should include one more to show direction.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: L\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nBut turn 27 is not necessary, but since I have it.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 25 U to (1,5), turn 26 U to (1,6), both U.\n\nThen turn 27 R to (2,6).\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (1,6) before it disappears (life span 7 at turn 22, so it must be eaten by turn 28), while ensuring long-term survival, the snake should prioritize reaching (1,6) efficiently. The path to (1,6) from the current position (4,4) takes 4 moves: left to (3,4), left to (2,4), left to (1,4), up to (1,5), and up to (1,6) on turn 26. This is achievable within the food's life span (present until turn 28). After eating, the snake must move right to (2,6) on turn 27 to avoid the top-left corner dead end.\n\nThe second food at (1,1) has a longer life span (10 at turn 22, present until turn 31), so it can be eaten later. After turn 27, the snake should navigate carefully to avoid collisions and reach (1,1), but detailed moves beyond turn 27 depend on the evolving board state. The sequence for turns 22-27 ensures the first food is eaten safely and sets up for future survival.\n\n### Planned Moves (5+ turns ahead):\n- **Turn 22**: Move L (left) to (3,4). This starts the path toward (1,6) and avoids the body segment at (4,3). Direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 23**: Move L (left) to (2,4). Continues the efficient path leftward. Direction remains L.\n- **Turn 24**: Move L (left) to (1,4). Positions the snake to move up toward (1,6). Direction remains L.\n- **Turn 25**: Move U (up) to (1,5). Approaches (1,6) directly. Direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 26**: Move U (up) to (1,6). Eats the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 10). Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 27**: Move R (right) to (2,6). Avoids corner trap; (1,6) is now a body segment, so moving right is the only safe option. Direction changes to R.\n\n### Rationale:\n- **Risk Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles (e.g., (3,1)), and body segments. Moving to the tail is safe only when not eating, but here no food is on the tail.\n- **Food Prioritization**: (1,6) is eaten by turn 26, well before its expiration (turn 28). (1,1) can be targeted after turn 27 with moves like down or right to navigate around the body, leveraging the longer life span.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 27, the snake can head downward (e.g., to row 5 or 6) to free space and approach (1,1) from the right or above. With 26 free cells after eating (snake length 10, grid 6x6=36 cells, minus 1 obstacle, minus 10 snake segments), there is ample room to maneuver and avoid dead ends.\n- **5+ Turns Planning**: The sequence covers 6 turns (22-27), ensuring (1,6) is eaten and the snake is positioned for future food collection. Beyond turn 27, moves should focus on reaching (1,1) via safe paths (e.g., moving down/right to avoid body congestion in column 1).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: L \\\\\nTurn 23: L \\\\\nTurn 24: L \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: R\n}",

        "step": 23,
        "score": 8,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 23, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) and (7,7) are corners, so walls are on the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,4), and body segments follow: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the tail is at (6,3).\n\nSnake head direction is L, which means left. So it's moving left from (3,4).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- One at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 6. Since it's turn 23, this food will disappear after 6 turns, so on turn 29 (23 + 6 = 29). Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 23, life span becomes 5, then 4, etc., until 0 when it disappears. But for decision making, I need to know how many turns it has left.\n\nLife span is given as 6 at turn 23, so it has 6 turns including turn 23. After turn 23, it will have 5 turns left, and so on. But since we're planning from turn 23, I should consider the remaining life.\n\nSimilarly, another food at (1,1) with value 1 and life span 9. So at turn 23, it has 9 turns left, disappearing after turn 31 (23 + 9 - 1? Let's clarify).\n\nThe life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So for food at (1,6), life span 6 at turn 23 means:\n\n- Turn 23: life span 6 (can be eaten)\n\n- Turn 24: life span 5\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 28: life span 1\n\n- Turn 29: life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly for (1,1): life span 9, so disappears after turn 31 (23 + 9 - 1 = 31? Let's calculate: after 9 turns from turn 23, it will be gone on turn 32. Turn 23: span 9, turn 24: span 8, ..., turn 31: span 1, turn 32: span 0, gone. So last chance to eat is turn 31.\n\nNow, both foods have value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to plan my moves starting from turn 23. Head is at (3,4) moving left, so from (3,4), moving left would go to (2,4).\n\nBut I have to avoid walls and body collisions. Walls are at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (3,1).\n\nAlso, body collision: head can't touch body except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the body segments are these coordinates.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,4) with direction L (left).\n\nSince direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R because reverse is not allowed. No instant reverse, so from left, I can go left, up, or down, but not right.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- Left (L): to (2,4)\n\n- Up (U): to (3,5)\n\n- Down (D): to (3,3)\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, but (2,4) is x=2, y=4, which is not border, so ok. Similarly, (3,5): y=5, not 0 or 7, ok. (3,3): y=3, ok. Also, obstacle at (3,1), not relevant here.\n\nNow, body collision: snake body is at (4,4), (4,3), etc. (2,4): is (2,4) occupied? Snake positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc. (2,4) is not in the list, so empty. Similarly, (3,5): not in positions. (3,3): not in positions. (4,3) is at (4,3), but (3,3) is different. So all three moves are safe in terms of immediate collision.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But in this case, tail is at (6,3), and head is at (3,4), not adjacent. Distance: |3-6| + |4-3| = 3+1=4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up/down/left/right, not diagonal.\n\nHead (3,4), tail (6,3): not adjacent. So no issue now.\n\nNow, food: there are foods at (1,6) and (1,1). Both positive.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat one or both, but safely.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders.\n\nObstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is kind of L-shaped or something.\n\nFrom (3,4) left to (4,4)? No: positions: (3,4) head, then (4,4) is next, so from head to body: (3,4) to (4,4) is right? Let's list coordinates in order: index 0: head (3,4), index 1: (4,4), index 2: (4,3), index 3: (4,2), index 4: (4,1), index 5: (5,1), index 6: (6,1), index 7: (6,2), index 8: (6,3) tail.\n\nSo the snake is moving: from tail to head: (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (3,4).\n\nSo it's like from (6,3) up to (6,2), up? (6,2) to (6,1) is down? y=2 to y=1, y decreasing down? Usually y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? The problem says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases up, decreases down. So (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nIn positions: (6,3) to (6,2): y from 3 to 2, so down? But tail is at (6,3), then (6,2) is previous, so moving from (6,2) to (6,1) is down, then to (5,1) left, then to (4,1) left, then to (4,2) up, to (4,3) up, to (4,4) up, to (3,4) left? Head direction is L, from (4,4) to (3,4) is left, yes.\n\nAt turn 23, head is moving left to (3,4), but it's already at (3,4), and direction is L, so next move it can go L, U, or D.\n\nNow, foods: (1,6) and (1,1).\n\n(1,6) is top-left, y=6 high, x=1.\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left, x=1, y=1.\n\nLife span: (1,6) has life 6, so must be eaten by turn 28 (since turn 23: span 6, turn 24:5, ..., turn 28:1, turn 29:0 gone).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life 9, must be eaten by turn 31.\n\nI need to get to one of these.\n\nFrom head (3,4), to (1,6) is left and up, to (1,1) is left and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's find a path to (1,6).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (1,6): need to go left to x=1, and up to y=6.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,4), then from there.\n\nBut (2,4) is empty.\n\nThen to (1,4), then to (1,5), then to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,4) and (1,5) need to be safe.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 is wall, so (0,4) not possible, but (1,4) is ok since x=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nNow, from (2,4), I can go L to (1,4), or U to (2,5), or D to (2,3).\n\nSimilarly to reach (1,6), going to (1,4) then up might work.\n\nBut the snake body might be in the way.\n\nCurrent body: let's list all occupied cells: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so one cell freed.\n\nUnless it eats food, then length increases, tail not removed.\n\nBut for now, no food eaten, so each move, tail is cut.\n\nIn this case, to go to (1,6), it might take a few turns.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (1,6): min steps: |3-1|=2 left, |4-6|=2 up, so at least 4 moves if direct, but might be more with obstacles.\n\nBut no obstacles directly, except the snake itself.\n\nPath: (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6). 4 moves to reach (1,6) from (3,4).\n\nBut at turn 23, I start from (3,4), so if I move L to (2,4) on turn 23, then on turn 24 at (2,4), then L to (1,4) turn 24? Turn 23: move to (2,4), so after move, head at (2,4) for turn 24.\n\nLet's define turns.\n\nAt turn t1=23, snake is at positions given, head at (3,4) with direction L.\n\nI choose action for turn 23, which moves the head to a new cell.\n\nThen turn 24, head at new position, and so on.\n\nFor turn 23, I choose to move to one of: (2,4), (3,5), or (3,3).\n\nIf I go to (2,4) on turn 23, then head at (2,4) for turn 24.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go L to (1,4), U to (2,5), D to (2,3), etc.\n\nIf I go to (1,4) on turn 24, then to (1,5) on turn 25, then to (1,6) on turn 26.\n\nSo by turn 26, I can be at (1,6) if I start moving left and up.\n\nBut (1,6) has food with life span 6 at turn 23.\n\nAt turn 23, life span 6, so it can be eaten until turn 28 (when life span 1 on turn 28, eaten on turn 28, gone on turn 29).\n\nTurn 26 is before turn 28, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,1): from (3,4) to (1,1): |3-1|=2 left, |4-1|=3 down, so min 5 moves.\n\nE.g., (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1). 5 moves: turn 23 to (2,4), turn 24 to (1,4), turn 25 to (1,3), turn 26 to (1,2), turn 27 to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) has life span 9, so can be eaten until turn 31, so turn 27 is fine.\n\nBut I need to consider the body and possible collisions.\n\nAlso, when I move, the tail moves, so the path might be blocked or freed.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,6), I need to go through (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nNow, are these cells occupied?\n\nAt turn 23: cells occupied: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(2,4) is free.\n\n(1,4) is free.\n\n(1,5) is free.\n\n(1,6) has food, but not occupied by snake.\n\nAfter moves, as snake moves, tail moves.\n\nSuppose on turn 23, I move to (2,4).\n\nThen new positions: head at (2,4), then the body: previous head was (3,4), so now body segments: (2,4) head, (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). Tail was (6,3), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so length same, tail now at (6,2)? Let's see.\n\nAfter moving to new cell without eating, the head moves to new position, and tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: new head at (2,4), then the rest: the previous body from index 1 onwards, but since tail removed, the list is: [ (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] because (6,3) is removed.\n\nOriginal positions: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] head to tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,4), new head at (2,4), and the body is the previous head and body except the tail is removed, so: [ (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] and tail at (6,2).\n\n(6,3) is gone.\n\nThen on turn 24, from (2,4), I can move to (1,4).\n\nThen new head at (1,4), body: [ (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] tail at (6,1).\n\nThen turn 25, from (1,4) to (1,5) up.\n\nNew head at (1,5), body: [ (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] tail at (5,1).\n\n(6,1) removed.\n\nThen turn 26, from (1,5) to (1,6), and since (1,6) has food, eat it, so length increases, tail not removed.\n\nNew head at (1,6), body: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] and tail at (5,1)? Original before move: head at (1,5), body to (5,1). After moving to (1,6) and eating, head at (1,6), and body is previous full body, so [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] yes, tail at (5,1).\n\nNow, all this seems fine, no collisions.\n\nBut what about the other food at (1,1)? I could go for that instead.\n\nBut (1,6) has shorter life, only 6 turns, while (1,1) has 9, so I should prioritize (1,6) since it disappears sooner.\n\nLife span: (1,6) disappears after turn 28, (1,1) after turn 31, so (1,6) is more urgent.\n\nAlso, from current position, going to (1,6) is shorter path than to (1,1), as calculated.\n\nTo (1,6): 3 moves to be on the cell on turn 26? From turn 23: after move, head at new position on same turn? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nWhen I take an action on turn t, I move to the new cell at the end of turn t, and the state updates.\n\nFor example, on turn 23, I choose action, say L, move to (2,4), now head at (2,4), and food at (1,6) has life span decreased to 5 (since turn 23 passed).\n\nAt turn 23 start, food life span 6.\n\nAfter I move on turn 23, the turn ends, so life span decreases.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nSo for (1,6): at turn 23 start, span 6.\n\nAfter turn 23 action, span becomes 5.\n\nAfter turn 24, span 4, and so on.\n\nIt can be eaten when head moves to it.\n\nTo eat on turn 26: on turn 26 action, move to (1,6), then eat.\n\nAt that time, span should be >0.\n\nTurn 26: from turn 23 to 26, 3 turns passed? Turn 23: after action, span 5\n\nTurn 24: after action, span 4\n\nTurn 25: after action, span 3\n\nTurn 26: before action, span 3, so if I move to (1,6) on turn 26, I eat it with span 3>0, fine.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,1) later.\n\nBut in this path to (1,6), it seems direct and safe.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nThe obstacle at (3,1) is not on the path.\n\nAlso, when I go to (1,4) or (1,5), are there any issues?\n\nAnother thing: after eating (1,6), the snake is longer, and I need to avoid dead ends or something.\n\nBut for now, getting the food is priority.\n\nI could go for (1,1) instead, but (1,6) is closer and urgent.\n\n(1,6) is at top-left, and snake is coming from right, so it should be ok.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6) on turn 26, head at (1,6), direction would be from (1,5) to (1,6), so up.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nNow, the other food at (1,1), I could go down to it after.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAlso, after eating, the tail is at (5,1), which is near the bottom.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=23, so turn 23,24,25,... at least 5 turns.\n\nSince I need to eat the food, I should specify actions until I eat or something.\n\nBut the format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but not specified how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 actions.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to survive.\n\nBut for now, let's go for (1,6).\n\nOn turn 23, from (3,4), move left to (2,4).\n\nThen turn 24, from (2,4), move left to (1,4).\n\nThen turn 25, from (1,4), move up to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 26, from (1,5), move up to (1,6) and eat.\n\nThen after that, I need to move away.\n\nBut on turn 26, after eating, head at (1,6), body long, tail at (5,1).\n\nNow, from (1,6), I can move U, D, L, R, but L: x=0 is wall, so cannot go left to (0,6).\n\nU: to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot go up.\n\nD: to (1,5), but (1,5) is now body, since after eating, positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), etc., so (1,5) is occupied, cannot go down.\n\nR: to (2,6), which might be free.\n\nWhat about (2,6)? Currently, after turn 26, positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ]\n\nSo (2,6) is not occupied, and not wall, so I can go right to (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, diagonal not possible.\n\nSo from (1,6), only possible move is right to (2,6).\n\nBecause up and left walls, down to (1,5) is body, so only right.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (1,6) move R to (2,6).\n\nThen head at (2,6), and since no food, tail moves? After eating on turn 26, length increased, so when I move on turn 27, if no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nOn turn 26, I ate food, so length is now 10 segments? Original snake had 9 positions: head + 8 body, so length 9.\n\nAfter eating, length 10.\n\nOn turn 27, if I move to (2,6) and no food there, then tail is removed, so positions: head at (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail at (4,1)? Let's see.\n\nBefore turn 27 move: positions [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] head (1,6), tail (5,1)\n\nMove head to (2,6), no food, so new head (2,6), and body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail (5,1) removed? The body is from index 1 to end, but since no food, the last element is removed.\n\nStandard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed, so the body is the previous head and all except tail.\n\nSo from [head: (1,6), body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail: (5,1)]\n\nAfter move to (2,6) no eat: new head (2,6), new body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) and tail (5,1) removed, so positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] tail at (4,1)\n\n(4,1) is occupied, but it's the tail.\n\nNow, from (2,6), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU: to (2,7), but y=7 wall, not possible.\n\nD: to (2,5), which is free? Current positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), etc., (2,5) not in list, so free.\n\nL: to (1,6), but (1,6) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nR: to (3,6), free? (3,6) not occupied, and not wall.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\nNow, I have another food at (1,1), which is still there.\n\nLife span: at turn 23, span 9.\n\nAfter turn 23,24,25,26: 4 turns passed, so at turn 27, before action, span should be 9-4=5? Let's track.\n\nTurn 23 start: span 9\n\nAfter turn 23: span 8\n\nAfter turn 24: span 7\n\nAfter turn 25: span 6\n\nAfter turn 26: span 5\n\nSo on turn 27, span 5, can be eaten until turn 31.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left.\n\nFrom current position (2,6), I need to go down and left.\n\nBut left is blocked, since (1,6) is body.\n\nSo I should go down or right.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nThen I can plan to go to (1,1).\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince the snake is long, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, after being at (2,6), if I go down to (2,5), then I can continue down.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nThere is an obstacle at (3,1), which is near (4,1), etc.\n\nIn the positions, (4,1) is part of the body.\n\nAfter turn 27, positions include (4,1), but as snake moves, it changes.\n\nI should consider going directly to (1,1) from the beginning.\n\nOn turn 23, instead of going left to (2,4), I could go down to (3,3) or up to (3,5).\n\nBut (1,6) is urgent, so better to get it first.\n\nPerhaps both are possible, but (1,6) is closer.\n\nDistance to (1,6) from (3,4): delta x=2, delta y=2, so Manhattan distance 4.\n\nTo (1,1): delta x=2, delta y=3, distance 5.\n\nSo (1,6) is closer.\n\nAnd shorter life, so priority.\n\nIn the path I described, on turn 26 I eat (1,6), then on turn 27 I go to (2,6), then I can go down to (2,5), then to (2,4)? But (2,4) is body.\n\nAfter turn 27, if I go to (2,5) on turn 27? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 26: head at (1,6), positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] tail (5,1)\n\nOn turn 27, I move to (2,6), as above, then positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] tail (4,1)\n\nNow on turn 28, from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nSuppose I move D to (2,5).\n\nThen new head (2,5), no food, so tail removed: new positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] tail (4,2)? Previous tail (4,1) removed, body from (1,6) to (4,2).\n\nList: new head (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) so tail (4,2)\n\nNow (2,5) is head.\n\nFrom here, I can move to (2,4)? But (2,4) is occupied, body.\n\nU to (2,6), occupied.\n\nD to (2,4) occupied, L to (1,5) occupied, R to (3,5) free? (3,5) not in positions.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (3,5)? From (2,5), moves: U to (2,6) occupied, D to (2,4) occupied, L to (1,5) occupied, R to (3,5) free.\n\nYes, only (3,5).\n\nSo move to (3,5) on turn 28? Turn 28 action.\n\nThen head at (3,5), and so on.\n\nBut I need to get to (1,1).\n\nFrom here, it might be tricky because the body is blocking the left side.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,1), I need to go left and down, but (2,4), (1,4), etc. are body, so I have to go around.\n\nPerhaps better to go for (1,1) first? But (1,6) disappears sooner.\n\nAnother idea: from the beginning, on turn 23, I could go down to (3,3) or something to approach (1,1).\n\nBut let's compare.\n\nFirst, let's confirm if going to (1,6) is safe.\n\nIn the path to (1,6), on turn 25, I am at (1,4), moving to (1,5) on turn 25.\n\nOn turn 25, before move, positions: after turn 24, I moved to (1,4) on turn 24.\n\nLet's list step by step from turn 23.\n\nTurn 23: start positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] head dir L\n\nAction: move L to (2,4)\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail (6,3) removed\n\nLife span: (1,6) was 6, now 5; (1,1) was 9, now 8\n\nTurn 24: from (2,4), move L to (1,4)\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail (6,2) removed? Previous tail (6,2) removed.\n\nLife span: (1,6) span 4; (1,1) span 7\n\n(1,4) has no food, so no eat.\n\nTurn 25: from (1,4), move U to (1,5)\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // tail (6,1) removed\n\nLife span: (1,6) span 3; (1,1) span 6\n\n(1,5) no food.\n\nTurn 26: from (1,5), move U to (1,6)\n\n(1,6) has food, eat it, value +1, length increase.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // tail not removed, length 10\n\nLife span: (1,6) eaten, gone; (1,1) span 5 (after this turn)\n\nNow, as before, from (1,6), only possible move is R to (2,6) on turn 27.\n\nTurn 27: move R to (2,6)\n\nNo food, so new positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail (5,1) removed\n\nLife span: (1,1) span 4\n\nNow from (2,6), as before, only possible moves D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nBoth should be safe, but let's see which is better for reaching (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom, so down might be better.\n\nMove D to (2,5) on turn 27? Turn 27 is the move to (2,6), so for turn 28.\n\nAfter turn 27, head at (2,6)\n\nTurn 28: from (2,6), move D to (2,5)\n\nNew head (2,5), no food, tail removed: new positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail (4,1) removed\n\nLife span: (1,1) span 3\n\nNow from (2,5), as before, only possible move R to (3,5), since U, D, L all occupied or wall.\n\nU (2,6) occupied, D (2,4) occupied, L (1,5) occupied, R (3,5) free.\n\nSo move to (3,5) on turn 28.\n\nNew head (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)  // tail (4,2) removed? Previous tail (4,2) removed.\n\nList: new head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nLife span: (1,1) span 2 after turn 28? After turn 28 action, span decreases.\n\nTurn 28: before action, (1,1) span 3? After turn 27, span 4, after turn 28 action, span 3.\n\nTo eat (1,1), I need to reach it soon.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to various places.\n\nFor example, down to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied, body.\n\nU to (3,6), free? (3,6) not occupied.\n\nD to (3,4) occupied.\n\nL to (2,5) occupied.\n\nR to (4,5), free? (4,5) not in positions.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is body, but (4,5) might be free.\n\nCurrent positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nSo (3,6) free, (4,5) free, (3,4) occupied, etc.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), R to (4,5), or D to (3,4) but occupied, L to (2,5) occupied, so only U or R.\n\nNow, to reach (1,1), I need to go left and down, but left is blocked by body.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (3,6), then I'm going up, away from (1,1).\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), then to (5,5) or something, still not left.\n\nThe body is blocking the left side, so I might not be able to reach (1,1) in time.\n\n(1,1) has span 3 after turn 28, so can be eaten on turn 29,30,31.\n\nBut from (3,5), to (1,1) is |3-1|=2 left, |5-1|=4 down, min 6 moves, but with body, it might take longer or impossible.\n\nFor example, shortest path: (3,5) to (3,4) but occupied, to (2,5) occupied, so I have to go around.\n\nSay to (4,5), then (4,4) occupied, (5,4) or something, then down to (5,1), but (5,1) might be free later, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps from turn 23, I should go for (1,1) first instead.\n\nBut (1,6) will expire soon.\n\nAnother option: on turn 23, go down to (3,3) to start towards (1,1).\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTurn 23: from (3,4), move D to (3,3)\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail (6,3) removed\n\nLife span: (1,6) span 5, (1,1) span 8\n\n(3,3) no food.\n\nThen turn 24: from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3), U to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, occupied, D to (3,2), or R to (4,3) but (4,3) is body.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,3), D to (3,2), or U to (3,4) occupied, R to (4,3) occupied, so only L or D.\n\nSay move L to (2,3).\n\nNew head (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail (6,2) removed\n\nThen turn 25: from (2,3), move L to (1,3), or U to (2,4), or D to (2,2), etc.\n\n(1,3) might be free.\n\nMove L to (1,3).\n\nNew head (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // tail (6,1) removed\n\nThen turn 26: from (1,3), move D to (1,2), or U to (1,4), etc.\n\nTo go to (1,1), move D to (1,2).\n\nNew head (1,2), positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail (5,1) removed\n\nThen turn 27: from (1,2), move D to (1,1), eat food.\n\nNew head (1,1), positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // length increase, tail not removed.\n\nSo I eat (1,1) on turn 27.\n\nBut (1,6) has only until turn 28 to be eaten, and I didn't go for it.\n\nAt turn 27, (1,6) span: at turn 23 start span 6, after 4 turns (23,24,25,26), span 2 on turn 27 before action.\n\nAfter turn 27 action, if I eat (1,1), span of (1,6) decreases to 1.\n\nThen on turn 28, I could try to go to (1,6), but from (1,1), it's far, and the body is in the way.\n\nFrom (1,1), after eating, I need to move, say to (1,0) but y=0 wall, or (0,1) x=0 wall, or (2,1), or (1,2) but (1,2) is body.\n\nPositions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo from (1,1), moves: U to (1,2) occupied, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) free? (2,1) not occupied.\n\nSo only R to (2,1).\n\nThen I can go up, but (1,6) is at (1,6), and I have to go through (1,4), (1,5), but they are body, so I can't go directly.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can go to (2,2), etc., but to reach (1,6) by turn 28 is impossible since turn 28 I am at (2,1) or something, far away.\n\nTurn 28: from (1,1) move R to (2,1)\n\nNew head (2,1), no food, tail removed: positions head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail (4,1) removed\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) occupied, R to (3,1) but (3,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (3,1), so cannot move to (3,1).\n\nR to (3,1) invalid.\n\nU to (2,2) free, or? (2,2) not occupied.\n\nAlso, D wall, L occupied, so only U to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 29, from (2,2) to (2,3) but (2,3) occupied, or to (3,2) or (1,2) occupied, etc. Complicated.\n\nBut (1,6) on turn 28 must be eaten, but I can't reach it, so it disappears.\n\nSo by going for (1,1) first, I miss (1,6).\n\nWhereas if I go for (1,6) first, I can eat it on turn 26, and (1,1) is still available until turn 31, so I might have a chance to get it later.\n\nIn the first scenario, after eating (1,6), I was at (2,6) on turn 27, then to (2,5) on turn 28, then to (3,5) on turn 28? Turn 28 to (3,5).\n\nThen from there, I can try to go down to reach (1,1).\n\nFor example, from (3,5) on turn 28, I can move to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nSay move R to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nNew head (4,5), positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  // tail (4,3) removed? Previous tail (4,3) removed.\n\nLife span: (1,1) span 3 after turn 28? After turn 28 action, span decreases to 3.\n\n(1,1) can be eaten on turn 29,30,31.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (4,6), (5,5), (4,4) occupied, (3,5) occupied.\n\nU to (4,6), R to (5,5), D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5) occupied.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nTo go down, I need to go to (5,5) or something, then down to (5,1), but (5,1) might be free.\n\nThe obstacle at (3,1) is there, but (1,1) is at (1,1), so I can go to (2,1), (1,1) if possible.\n\nBut from current position, it's hard to reach quickly.\n\nFor instance, from (4,5) to (1,1): |4-1|=3 left, |5-1|=4 down, min 7 moves, but with body, it might take more, and by turn 31, I have 3 turns: 29,30,31, so possible if I go directly.\n\nBut the left side is blocked.\n\nAfter some moves, the body moves, so cells free up.\n\nFor example, the tail is moving, so (4,4), (4,3) etc. will be freed as snake moves.\n\nBut it's risky.\n\nSince (1,1) has longer life, I can go for it after eating (1,6), but I need a path.\n\nPerhaps on turn 23, I can go down to (3,3) to be closer to both, but (1,6) is up, so not efficient.\n\nAnother idea: go to (1,4) first, then I can choose to go up to (1,6) or down to (1,1).\n\nOn turn 23, go L to (2,4), turn 24 go L to (1,4), then on turn 25, from (1,4), I can go U to (1,5) towards (1,6) or D to (1,3) towards (1,1).\n\nSince (1,6) is urgent, I should go up to eat it on turn 26, as before.\n\nThen after that, I can try to go down from (1,6), but I can't, so I go to (2,6), then to (2,5), etc., as before.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 28, I went to (3,5), but I could have gone to (3,6) if I chose, but (3,6) is up.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps from (2,4) on turn 24, instead of going to (1,4), I could go down to (2,3) or something, but that delays eating (1,6).\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I think the best is to eat (1,6) first as planned, and for (1,1), if possible, but I may not reach it, but since the game is about maximizing score, eating one food is better than none, and I can survive.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but not mentioned, so only these two.\n\nThe state has only these foods, so I should try to eat both if possible.\n\nBut in this case, with the snake position, it might be difficult to eat (1,1) after.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (1,1) before it expires.\n\nFrom the state after eating (1,6), on turn 27 at (2,6), I could go directly down if possible, but from (2,6), I can go to (2,5), then from (2,5) I have to go to (3,5), not down.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nSay I go to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen on turn 29, from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) or (5,5) or (4,4) occupied.\n\nSay go R to (5,5).\n\nNew head (5,5), positions: let's not detail, but (1,1) is at (1,1), far.\n\nI could go to (5,4) or something, then down to (5,1), but (5,1) might be free.\n\nFor example, on turn 29, from (5,5) move D to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut to (1,1), it's not direct.\n\nThe shortest path from (5,5) to (1,1) is 4 left and 4 down, 8 moves, but I have only 3 turns to eat (turn 29,30,31), so impossible to reach in time.\n\nFrom earlier position, on turn 28 at (3,5), to (1,1) is 2 left and 4 down, but with obstacles, min 6 moves, not enough in 3 turns.\n\nTurn 28,29,30,31: 4 actions, but from (3,5) to (1,1) in 4 moves? |3-1|=2, |5-1|=4, min 6, so no, cannot reach in 4 moves.\n\nSo if I eat (1,6) on turn 26, I cannot eat (1,1) before it expires on turn 31.\n\nBut if I don't eat (1,6), I can eat (1,1) on turn 27 as in the second plan, but miss (1,6).\n\nSo better to eat (1,6) since it gives the same score and is urgent.\n\nAnd (1,1) might not be eaten, but I score at least one.\n\nIf I eat both, I score two, but in this case, it's not possible to eat both with the current positions.\n\nIs there a way to eat both?\n\nFor example, from turn 23, go to (2,4), then to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut to (1,6) it takes more turns.\n\nSuppose turn 23: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 24: move D to (2,3)  // instead of to (1,4)\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go L to (1,3), then down to (1,2), (1,1) to eat on turn 27, as before.\n\nBut then (1,6) not eaten.\n\nOr from (2,3) go to (1,3), then up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) to eat on turn 28.\n\nOn turn 28, (1,6) span: turn 23 span 6, after 5 turns (23 to 27), on turn 28 before action, span should be 1, so I can eat on turn 28.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nTurn 23 start: span 6\n\nAfter turn 23: span 5\n\nAfter turn 24: span 4\n\nAfter turn 25: span 3\n\nAfter turn 26: span 2\n\nAfter turn 27: span 1\n\nTurn 28: before action, span 1, so if I move to (1,6) on turn 28, I eat it.\n\nNow, can I reach (1,6) by turn 28?\n\nFrom turn 23: at (3,4), move L to (2,4) turn 23\n\nTurn 24: move D to (2,3)  // now at (2,3)\n\nTurn 25: move L to (1,3)  // at (1,3)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (1,4)  // at (1,4)\n\nTurn 27: move U to (1,5)  // at (1,5)\n\nTurn 28: move U to (1,6) eat.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,1), I could have gone down from (1,3) instead.\n\nBut in this path, I eat (1,6) on turn 28.\n\nNow, for (1,1), with span 9 at turn 23, after 5 turns to turn 28, span 4, so I can eat it later.\n\nAfter eating (1,6) on turn 28, head at (1,6), then I must move R to (2,6) on turn 29.\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (2,5), etc., and try to reach (1,1).\n\n(1,1) can be eaten until turn 31.\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 29, to (1,1): |2-1|=1 left, |6-1|=5 down, min 6 moves, but I have only 3 actions: turn 29,30,31.\n\nTurn 29: I am at (2,6) after moving from (1,6).\n\nTurn 29 action: from (1,6) move to (2,6), so on turn 29, head at (2,6).\n\nThen I need to move to (1,1) by turn 31.\n\nBut |2-1|=1, |6-1|=5, difference 6, so in 3 moves, impossible to reach (1,1) from (2,6).\n\nMinimum moves required is 6, but only 3 turns, so cannot eat (1,1) if I eat (1,6) late.\n\nIn the first plan, I ate (1,6) on turn 26, and had more time for (1,1), but the path was blocked.\n\nBut still, from turn 27 at (2,6), to (1,1) in 4 moves min, but with 4 turns: turn 27,28,29,30,31? Turn 27 to 31 is 5 actions, but I need to be at (1,1) on or before turn 31.\n\nTurn 27: at (2,6)\n\nTurn 28: move to say (2,5) or (3,6)\n\nThen turn 29, etc.\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go down to (2,5), then to (2,4) but occupied, to (3,5), not down.\n\nIt's not direct.\n\nThe only way to eat both is to eat (1,1) first quickly and then (1,6), but (1,6) expires soon.\n\nIn the second approach, eat (1,1) on turn 27, then (1,6) on turn 28.\n\nFrom turn 23: move L to (2,4) turn 23\n\nTurn 24: move L to (1,4) turn 24\n\nTurn 25: move D to (1,3)  // towards (1,1)\n\nTurn 26: move D to (1,2) \n\nTurn 27: move D to (1,1) eat\n\nThen on turn 28, from (1,1), I can only move R to (2,1), as before.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), etc., but to reach (1,6) by turn 28, I am at (2,1) on turn 28, far from (1,6), and only one turn left, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot eat both; I have to choose one.\n\nSince both have value +1, I should choose the one that is more urgent, which is (1,6) with shorter life.\n\nAlso, in the first plan, I eat it earlier and have a chance to survive longer.\n\nSo I think going for (1,6) directly is better.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nSince the format is to list actions from turn t1, I can list for 5 turns or until I eat the food.\n\nBut to be safe, let's list the actions for the first plan.\n\nTurn 23: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 24: move L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 25: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (1,6) and eat\n\nThen for turn 27: move R to (2,6)\n\nFor turn 28: from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6), say D to (2,5) to go down.\n\nBut since I need to list, and think ahead, but after that, it's open.\n\nPerhaps list 5 actions: turn 23 to 27.\n\nBut turn 27 is after eating.\n\nIn the state, after turn 26, I have eaten, so for turn 27, I move to (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 28, I can decide.\n\nBut the answer should include actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 26, I can list up to turn 27 or 28.\n\nBut to show 5 turns ahead, from turn 23 to 27 or 28.\n\nTurn 23 to 27 is 5 turns: 23,24,25,26,27.\n\nActions on each turn.\n\nOn turn 23: move L\n\nTurn 24: move L\n\nTurn 25: move U\n\nTurn 26: move U\n\nTurn 27: move R\n\nThen for turn 28, it's not specified, but I can stop at turn 27.\n\nTo be complete, I can add one more.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, the head direction is L, and I am moving L, U, U, so direction changes.\n\nBut no reverse issue, since from L, I move L, then from there to L again, or U, etc., no opposite.\n\nFor example, from L, moving U is not opposite, opposite would be R, which I don't move.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAlso, in the path, no collision.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nFor the answer, I need to box it.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: L\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nAnd for turn 28, if I want, but not necessary.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", 5 actions are ok.\n\nI could include turn 28 move D or something, but it's not critical.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (1,6) while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating this food first due to its shorter life span (6 turns remaining at turn 23, disappearing after turn 28). The food at (1,1) has a longer life span (9 turns remaining, disappearing after turn 31) and can be considered later if possible, but the path to it may be blocked after eating (1,6). The snake starts at head position (3,4) with direction left (L). The plan involves moving directly to (1,6) in 4 turns (turns 23 to 26), eating it on turn 26. After eating, the snake must move right to (2,6) on turn 27 to avoid being trapped at (1,6). Subsequent moves focus on survival and positioning for potential access to (1,1), though reaching it may not be feasible due to the snake's length and body positions.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Priority**: (1,6) must be eaten by turn 28, while (1,1) can be eaten until turn 31. Eating (1,6) first scores +1 and increases length.\n- **Path Safety**: The path to (1,6) via (2,4), (1,4), and (1,5) is safe, with no immediate collisions or wall issues.\n- **Turn-by-Turn Actions**: \n  - Turn 23: Move left (L) to (2,4) – direct path to (1,6), avoids walls and body.\n  - Turn 24: Move left (L) to (1,4) – continues toward (1,6), cell is free.\n  - Turn 25: Move up (U) to (1,5) – positions for final move to food, cell is free.\n  - Turn 26: Move up (U) to (1,6) – eats food, score +1, length increases to 10.\n  - Turn 27: Move right (R) to (2,6) – necessary to escape (1,6), as up/down/left are blocked by walls or body.\n- **Post-Eating Survival**: After turn 27, the snake is at (2,6). From here, moves are constrained; down to (2,5) or right to (3,6) are options, but the body may block access to (1,1). Given the distance and remaining turns (turn 28 to 31 for (1,1)), eating (1,1) is unlikely, so the focus shifts to avoiding collisions and surviving. For example, on turn 28, moving down to (2,5) is recommended to explore the grid safely.\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: The plan covers turns 23 to 27 (5 turns), with turn 28 suggested for completeness. Thinking beyond, the snake should navigate toward open areas (e.g., right or down) to avoid dead ends, but new food may spawn, so flexibility is key.\n\n### Answer Format:\nThe actions for turns 23 to 27 are specified below. Turn 28 is included to demonstrate survival focus.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: L (left)  \nTurn 24: L (left)  \nTurn 25: U (up)  \nTurn 26: U (up)  \nTurn 27: R (right)  \nTurn 28: D (down)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 24. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,4), then body segments at (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating them gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 24.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls on borders. Obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head at (2,4), moving left. Body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So from (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1), etc., up to head.\n\n(4,1) is occupied by the snake, but there's an obstacle at (3,1), which is different. (3,1) is a wall, not snake.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is a food position, but let's see what's around it.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,4). Since head direction is L, it came from the right, so it can move left, up, or down, but not right (no instant reverse). Moving left would be to (1,4).\n\nPossible moves from (2,4):\n\n- Left (L): to (1,4)\n\n- Up (U): to (2,5)\n\n- Down (D): to (2,3)\n\nCannot go right to (3,4) because that's the body, and it's occupied except for the tail.\n\nBody segments: positions are all occupied except that when the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell where the tail was becomes free, but only after the move.\n\nIn terms of collision: when moving, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is occupied by a body segment (except the tail, because the tail will move), it's a collision. Also, if it's a wall or out of bounds.\n\nHere, walls are borders, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is invalid. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nFor (2,4):\n\n- Left to (1,4): is (1,4) valid? x=1, y=4. Not a border wall, not obstacle. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). (1,4) is not in this list, so empty? Food might be there, but food is at (1,6) and (1,1), not (1,4), so (1,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, up to (2,5): y=5, not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions, so free.\n\nDown to (2,3): similarly, should be free.\n\nRight to (3,4): (3,4) is the second segment, which is not the tail, so moving there would cause collision. Cannot go right.\n\nSo possible actions at turn 24: L, U, D.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple steps ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the food positions.\n\nFood at (1,6): life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 24, life span 5, so it will be there until turn 28? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns? No.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (1,6,5,1)\" so life span 5 at turn 24.\n\nI think \"disappears after N turns\" means it will be gone at the end of turn (t + N), or something.\n\nAssume that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and when life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n\nTo be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn 24, life span is 5, after turn 24 is processed, life span becomes 4 for turn 25, and so on, until life span 1 on turn 28, after turn 28 it becomes 0 and disappears, so it should be available until turn 28 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases each turn including current, and disappears after N turns, it might mean that it exists for N turns starting from now.\n\nBut let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's safer to assume that the food is present for exactly N turns, including the current one if we eat it.\n\nFor planning, I need to know when it disappears.\n\nSuppose at turn t, life span L.\n\nAfter turn t, L decreases by 1, so at turn t+1, life span is L-1.\n\nWhen L = 1 at turn t, after turn t, L=0, and it disappears, so not available for turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, for food with life span L at turn t, it is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive? Let's index.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, life span is L.\n\nDuring turn t, it can be eaten. After the turn, life span decrements to L-1.\n\nIf L-1 > 0, it remains for next turn.\n\nWhen life span is 1 at the beginning of turn t, after turn t, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo, the last turn it can be eaten is when life span is 1, i.e., turn t + (L - 1) if we start from turn t.\n\nFor this food at (1,6): at turn 24, life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 24 to turn 24 + 4 = 28? Let's calculate:\n\n- Turn 24: life span 5, can be eaten, after turn, life span=4\n\n- Turn 25: life span 4, can be eaten, after turn, life span=3\n\n- Turn 26: life span 3, can be eaten, after turn, life span=2\n\n- Turn 27: life span 2, can be eaten, after turn, life span=1\n\n- Turn 28: life span 1, can be eaten, after turn, life span=0, disappears.\n\nSo available turns: 24 to 28 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,1): life span 8 at turn 24, so available from turn 24 to 24 + 7 = 31? Turn 24 to 31 inclusive.\n\nTurn 24: L=8, after turn L=7\n\n...\n\nTurn 31: L=1, after turn L=0, gone.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, both foods are positive, value 1 each.\n\nSnake head at (2,4), food at (1,6) and (1,1).\n\n(1,6) is above and left, (1,1) is below and left.\n\nFrom (2,4), to reach (1,6): need to go left and up.\n\nTo (1,1): left and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles and snake body to consider.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,2), which might move.\n\nFirst, I should think about the immediate move at turn 24.\n\nPossible moves: L to (1,4), U to (2,5), D to (2,3).\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (1,6). It's at (1,6), which is near the top. y=6, x=1.\n\nGrid y from 0 to 7, so y=6 is one below top wall y=7.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is near bottom, y=1, one above y=0.\n\nHead at (2,4), so (1,6) is 2 steps away: one left and one up, but not directly, since from (2,4) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6), or via other paths.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (1,6): Manhattan distance |2-1| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3 cells, so at least 3 moves if no obstacles.\n\nBut we can go directly if possible.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), if we go up to (2,5), then left to (1,5), then up to (1,6), that's 3 turns.\n\nOr go left to (1,4), then up to (1,5), then up to (1,6), same.\n\nOr other ways.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,1): from (2,4), go left to (1,4), then down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), 4 steps? |dx|=1, |dy|=3, so 4 steps min.\n\nBut we need to consider the path and safety.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (3,1), which might block paths to (1,1).\n\n(3,1) is a wall, so we cannot go there.\n\nNow, the snake body: current positions, but when we move, the tail moves, so cells free up.\n\nTail is at (6,2), and when snake moves, the tail moves, so (6,2) will be free after the move, but for the head movement, we need to see where the tail is moving to.\n\nFor collision, when head moves to a cell, it should not be occupied by any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (6,2), and it's connected to (6,1) which is the previous segment.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — (6,2) is the last, so tail is (6,2).\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail (6,2) will move to where the second last was, but it's a bit messy.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at head moves to where the head was, and so on, and the tail segment is removed from its position, so that cell becomes empty.\n\nFor collision: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the current tail (because after move, tail moves, so that cell is free), it's a collision.\n\nIf it moves to the tail cell, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this snake, positions: let's list indices: index 0: head (2,4), index 1: (3,4), index 2: (4,4), index 3: (4,3), index 4: (4,2), index 5: (4,1), index 6: (5,1), index 7: (6,1), index 8: (6,2) tail.\n\nWhen snake moves in a direction, head goes to new position. Then segment 1 moves to (2,4), segment 2 to (3,4), ..., segment 8 moves to (6,1), and the old tail (6,2) is no longer part of snake, so (6,2) becomes empty.\n\nFor head moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any of the current body segments except the tail, it's collision. If it moves to the tail cell, it's safe because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, for move from (2,4) to (1,4): (1,4) is not in the snake positions, so safe.\n\nTo (2,5): not in positions, safe.\n\nTo (2,3): not in positions, safe.\n\n(2,3) is not listed, so ok.\n\nNow, what about after move? I need to plan multiple steps.\n\nAlso, there is a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head collides with the new tail.\n\nIn this state, tail is at (6,2). Head is at (2,4), not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,4) neighbors are (1,4), (3,4), (2,5), (2,3). (3,4) is body, not tail. Tail is (6,2), far away. So no issue now.\n\nFood at (1,1): (1,1) is a food position. Tail is at (6,2), not adjacent to (1,1), so no danger there.\n\nBut if we go to eat (1,1), we need to see when we approach.\n\nFirst, I should consider going for the closer food or the one with shorter life span.\n\n(1,6) has life span 5, available until turn 28, (1,1) has life span 8, until turn 31.\n\nBut (1,6) is closer to current position? From (2,4) to (1,6): Δx=1 left, Δy=2 up, so Manhattan dist 3.\n\nTo (1,1): Δx=1 left, Δy=3 down, dist 4.\n\nSo (1,6) is slightly closer.\n\nBut we have to navigate the body and obstacles.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 9 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls on borders.\n\nInternal wall at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (2,4), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2).\n\nSo from (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) then down to (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), then right to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2)? (6,1) to (6,2) is up.\n\nSo the snake has a bend at (4,4) going down, and at (4,1) going right, then at (6,1) going up.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (1,1).\n\n(1,6) is at top-left area, (1,1) at bottom-left.\n\nFrom head (2,4), if I go left to (1,4), I'm closer to both foods, but (1,4) is empty.\n\nThen from (1,4), I can go up to (1,5) or down to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go up twice from (1,4): to (1,5) then (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, to (1,1), go down from (1,4) to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) has a wall at (3,1), but (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, not directly blocking (1,1), but it might affect paths from other directions.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,1) from the right, (3,1) is a wall, so we can't go through there, but from above, it might be ok.\n\nSince the snake is coming from the right, and head is at (2,4), going down to (2,3) might be another option.\n\nI need to think about the space and possible dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (4,1) to (6,2) is occupied by snake, but as the snake moves, it will free up cells.\n\nSpecifically, the tail is at (6,2), so when the snake moves, (6,2) will be free, then (6,1), etc., depending on direction.\n\nBut the head direction determines how the body moves.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, I should avoid boxing myself in.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves at turn 24.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (1,4)\n\nThen head at (1,4), and body moves: segment 1 to (2,4), segment 2 to (3,4), segment 3 to (4,4), segment 4 to (4,3), segment 5 to (4,2), segment 6 to (4,1), segment 7 to (5,1), segment 8 to (6,1), and tail (6,2) gone. So new positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). Tail at (6,1).\n\nFrom (1,4), I can go up, down, or right, but not left because x=0 is wall, so left to (0,4) invalid. Also, no instant reverse, but current head direction after move: I moved left, so head direction is now L, so I cannot move right next turn because that would be reverse.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction is updated to the move direction.\n\nSo if I move L at turn 24, new head direction is L, so at turn 25, I cannot move R.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U or D.\n\nFrom (1,4), after moving L, possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), or since no left, only U or D.\n\nCannot go right because reverse.\n\nNow, if I go U to (1,5), then to (1,6) for food, but (1,6) has food, so if I go to (1,5) on turn 25, then to (1,6) on turn 26, I can eat it on turn 26.\n\nTurn 24: move to (1,4), not eating food.\n\nTurn 25: from (1,4), move U to (1,5), not eating food yet.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (1,6), eat food, since (1,6) has food, value +1, length increases by 1.\n\nWhen I eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; I add a new head at the food position, and the tail stays, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, on turn 26, if I move to (1,6), I eat the food, so the new position: head at (1,6), and the previous head (1,5) becomes body, so the body extends, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 24 move L to (1,4): positions as above.\n\nTurn 25: move U to (1,5): head to (1,5), body: segment 1 to (1,4), segment 2 to (2,4), etc., down to segment 8 to (5,1), and tail (6,1) gone. New tail is (5,1)? Positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). Tail at (5,1).\n\n(6,1) is gone.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (1,6): now (1,6) has food, so eat it. New head at (1,6), and since eating, tail doesn't move, so body: previous head (1,5) now body, then (1,4), (2,4), ..., up to (5,1), so now snake has 10 segments, tail at (5,1).\n\nAnd food at (1,6) is consumed, so removed.\n\nNow, life span of (1,6) is 5 at turn 24, so on turn 26 it is still available, life span at turn 25 would be 4, turn 26: 3? Let's track.\n\nTurn 24: food (1,6) life span 5\n\nAfter turn 24: life span decrements to 4\n\nTurn 25: life span 4, after turn to 3\n\nTurn 26: life span 3, when we move to (1,6), we eat it, so it is consumed, life span irrelevant now.\n\nSimilarly, it was available.\n\nNow, after eating at (1,6), head at (1,6), which is top-left corner almost.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: down to (1,5), but (1,5) is now body, so cannot, or right to (2,6), or up, but y=6, up to (1,7) is y=7, which is wall, so invalid. Left to (0,6) invalid. So only possible move is right to (2,6).\n\nIs (2,6) free? Currently, after turn 26, positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). So (2,6) not occupied, and not wall, so yes.\n\nHead direction after move U to (1,6) is U, so at turn 27, from (1,6), only possible move is R to (2,6), since up and left invalid, down to (1,5) is body, cannot.\n\nSo I must go to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go down, left, or right, but not up (reverse).\n\nDown to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut now the snake is at top, and body is below, so I might be able to go down.\n\nBut I also have another food at (1,1) to consider.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, life span until turn 31, so I have time.\n\nBut after going to (1,6), I'm at (1,6), and I have to go right to (2,6), then I can go down or right.\n\nThe area below might be congested.\n\nFor example, positions after turn 26: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nSo row y=1 has (4,1) and (5,1), but (5,1) is tail.\n\nAs I move, tail moves.\n\nBut (1,1) is free, but to reach it, I need to go down from (2,6) to (2,5), (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied by body, so I cannot go directly.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can go down to (2,5), then to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, so on turn 27, if I go to (2,6), then turn 28, possible moves from (2,6): down to (2,5), left to (1,6) but (1,6) is previous head or body, now it's body, cannot. Right to (3,6), up invalid. So only down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\nIf I go down to (2,5), then (2,5) should be free? After turn 27: let's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 26: positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTurn 27: move R to (2,6): head to (2,6), body moves: segment to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail (5,1) gone. New positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Tail at (4,1).\n\n(5,1) gone.\n\nNow from (2,6), head direction R, so cannot move left (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: down to (2,5), right to (3,6), or up to (2,7) invalid, left to (1,6) is body, cannot. So only down or right.\n\n(2,5): is it occupied? Positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), etc., no (2,5), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) not occupied, free.\n\nIf I go down to (2,5), then from there, I can go down to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, cannot. Left to (1,5) body, cannot. Right to (3,5), or up to (2,6) reverse, invalid. So only right to (3,5) if free.\n\n(3,5) not in positions, should be free.\n\nBut I'm moving away from (1,1).\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go down and left, but the left side is blocked by body.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), if I go right to (3,6), then I can go down to (3,5), etc., but it might take longer to reach (1,1).\n\nMoreover, (1,1) has longer life span, so I can go for it later.\n\nBut in this path, after eating (1,6), I'm at top and have to move right or down, and the body is to the left and below, so I might be able to circle around, but it could be risky if I get trapped.\n\nLet's think of another initial move.\n\nAt turn 24, instead of going left, I could go up or down.\n\nFirst, go up to (2,5).\n\nTurn 24: move U to (2,5)\n\nThen new positions: head (2,5), body: segment to (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2) gone. New tail at (6,1).\n\n(6,2) gone.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) is at (1,6), which is up-left from here.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: left to (1,5), up to (2,6), down to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, cannot. Right to (3,5), or since head direction U, cannot move down (reverse).\n\nAfter move U, head direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,5), U to (2,6), R to (3,5).\n\n(1,5) not occupied, free; (2,6) free; (3,5) free.\n\nTo reach (1,6), I can go left to (1,5) on turn 25, then up to (1,6) on turn 26.\n\nTurn 25: from (2,5), move L to (1,5)\n\nThen positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)\n\nThen turn 26: move U to (1,6), eat food (1,6), since it's there.\n\nNew head (1,6), body: previous head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), ..., (6,1), so length 10, tail at (6,1).\n\nThen from (1,6), same as before, only can go right to (2,6) on next turn.\n\nSimilar situation.\n\nI could go directly to (1,6) if possible, but from (2,5), I can go to (1,5) then (1,6), not directly.\n\nAnother option at turn 24: go down to (2,3).\n\nTurn 24: move D to (2,3)\n\nThen positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2) gone. New tail at (6,1).\n\nNow, from (2,3), head direction D, so cannot move up (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: left to (1,3), down to (2,2), right to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) free, (2,2) free, (3,3) free.\n\nNow, this might be better for reaching (1,1) later.\n\nBut (1,6) is still there, and I can go for it.\n\nFrom (2,3), to go to (1,6), I need to go left and up, but it's farther.\n\nFor example, go left to (1,3) on turn 25, then up to (1,4) turn 26, up to (1,5) turn 27, up to (1,6) turn 28.\n\nBut life span of (1,6) is until turn 28, so on turn 28, I can eat it if I reach.\n\nTurn 28: life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nBut from turn 24 to 28, 4 moves: 24,25,26,27,28.\n\nOn turn 24 I move to (2,3), not towards (1,6).\n\nThen turn 25: to (1,3), turn 26: to (1,4), turn 27: to (1,5), turn 28: to (1,6) eat.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nBut I could be faster if I go directly.\n\nEarlier with left or up, I can eat by turn 26.\n\nWith down, I eat by turn 28, which is later, but still within life span.\n\nBut there's another food at (1,1) with longer life span.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (1,1) first since it's in the bottom.\n\nLet's consider going for (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,4), to reach (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, go left to (1,4) on turn 24, then down to (1,3) turn 25, down to (1,2) turn 26, down to (1,1) turn 27 eat.\n\n(1,1) life span 8, turn 27 is fine.\n\nBut when I go to (1,1), is there any danger?\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, and there's a wall at (3,1), but (3,1) is not adjacent to (1,1), so no issue.\n\nAlso, tail is at (6,2), far away.\n\nBut when I eat at (1,1), the snake grows, and I'm at (1,1), which has only two exits: up to (1,2) or right to (2,1), but (2,1) might be occupied.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 24: move L to (1,4) as before.\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)\n\nTurn 25: move D to (1,3)  (down to (1,3))\n\nHead direction L, so can move down or up, not right.\n\nMove D to (1,3)\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), and tail (6,1) gone. New tail at (5,1).\n\n(6,1) gone.\n\nTurn 26: move D to (1,2)  (down to (1,2))\n\nPositions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 27: move D to (1,1), eat food (1,1)\n\nNew head (1,1), body: previous head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) so length 10, tail at (5,1)\n\nNow from (1,1), possible moves: up to (1,2), but (1,2) is body, cannot. Right to (2,1), or left and down invalid. So only right to (2,1).\n\nIs (2,1) free? Currently, positions have (4,1) and (5,1), but (2,1) not occupied, and not wall. Wall at (3,1), but (2,1) is different.\n\nSo (2,1) should be free.\n\nMove to (2,1).\n\nHead direction after move D to (1,1) is D, so at turn 28, from (1,1), move R to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go up, down, or right, not left (reverse).\n\nDown to (2,0) invalid, so up to (2,2) or right to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, obstacle, so invalid.\n\nRight to (3,1) is wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is up to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is occupied? After move to (2,1) on turn 28.\n\nLet's see positions after turn 27: after eating, head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — tail (5,1)\n\n(4,1) is body, (5,1) tail.\n\nTurn 28: move R to (2,1): head to (2,1), body moves: segment to (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail (5,1) gone. New positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Tail at (4,1).\n\n(5,1) gone.\n\nNow from (2,1), head direction R, so cannot move left.\n\nPossible moves: up to (2,2), down invalid, right to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, invalid. Left to (1,1) body, cannot.\n\nSo only up to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is not in positions, so free? Positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), etc., no (2,2), so yes, free.\n\nMove to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go up, down, left, right.\n\nBut left to (1,2) is body, cannot; down to (2,1) is body, cannot; right to (3,2) or up to (2,3).\n\n(3,2) and (2,3) should be free.\n\nBut the body is around, so I might be able to navigate.\n\nHowever, in this case, I ate (1,1) on turn 27, but I missed (1,6) which disappears after turn 28, so I could go for it after.\n\nAfter turn 28, I'm at (2,2), and (1,6) is still available until turn 28, but on turn 28, I'm moving to (2,1) or something, not to (1,6).\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nTurn 24: move to (1,4)\n\nTurn 25: move to (1,3)\n\nTurn 26: move to (1,2)\n\nTurn 27: move to (1,1) eat (1,1)\n\nTurn 28: move to (2,1)\n\nThen from (2,1), on turn 29, move to (2,2) as above.\n\nBut (1,6) is available until turn 28, so on turn 28, I need to be at (1,6) to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 28, I'm at (2,1), which is far, and I have to move to (2,1), so I can't reach (1,6) by turn 28.\n\nFrom (2,1) on turn 28, I can only go to (2,2) on turn 29, not to (1,6).\n\nSo (1,6) will disappear after turn 28, uneaten.\n\nIf I go for (1,1) first, I miss (1,6).\n\nIf I go for (1,6) first, I can eat it by turn 26, then I have time for (1,1).\n\n(1,1) life span until turn 31, so after eating (1,6) on turn 26, I can go down to (1,1).\n\nFor example, after eating (1,6) on turn 26, head at (1,6), then turn 27 move to (2,6), turn 28 from (2,6) I can move down to (2,5), turn 29 to (2,4) but (2,4) might be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 26: positions with food eaten: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 27: move R to (2,6): head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n\nTurn 28: from (2,6), move D to (2,5): head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1)? Positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — 11 segments? After growth, length 10, but when moving, tail moves.\n\nTurn 27: after move, positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — that's 10 positions, tail at (4,1)\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,5): head to (2,5), body: segment to (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail (4,1) gone. New positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go down to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, cannot. Left to (1,5) body, cannot. Right to (3,5), or up to (2,6) body, cannot. Head direction D, so cannot move up. Only possible move is right to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) free.\n\nMove to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, cannot. Left to (2,5) body, cannot. Right to (4,5), up to (3,6), down to (3,4) invalid.\n\nHead direction R (since I moved right to (3,5)? From (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so head direction R.\n\nAt (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but occupied, L to (2,5) occupied, R to (4,5).\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nSay move to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nBut I'm moving away from (1,1).\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go down and left, but the body is blocking the way.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go down, (3,4) is occupied, so I can't.\n\nI have to go around, but it might be difficult with the body there.\n\nThe tail is at (4,2), which will move as I go.\n\nBut it could take many turns to reach (1,1), and I might risk collision.\n\nFor example, the area around (4,1) to (4,4) is dense with body.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for (1,1) first, but then I miss (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) has shorter life span, so it's more urgent.\n\nI could go down first at turn 24 to position for both.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 24, go down to (2,3), then I can go left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), (1,1) for food, or up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) for the other.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (1,1): turn 24 to (2,3), turn 25 to (1,3), turn 26 to (1,2), turn 27 to (1,1) eat by turn 27.\n\nTo (1,6): from (2,3) to (1,3) turn 25, to (1,4) turn 26, to (1,5) turn 27, to (1,6) turn 28 eat.\n\nBoth possible, but I can only do one sequence.\n\nIf I go to (1,1) first, I eat on turn 27, then from there, I can go to (2,1) on turn 28, then to (2,2) on turn 29, then to (2,3) or (3,2), etc., but to reach (1,6) by turn 28, I need to be at (1,6) on turn 28, but on turn 28 I'm at (2,1) or (2,2), not at (1,6), so I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,6) first from (2,3), I eat on turn 28, then I can go for (1,1) later.\n\nBut (1,1) life span until turn 31, so after turn 28, I have turns 29,30,31 to reach (1,1).\n\nFrom position after eating (1,6) on turn 28, head at (1,6), then turn 29 to (2,6), turn 30 to say (2,5) or (3,6), then I need to go down to (1,1), but it's far, and body might be in the way.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) on turn 29, I can go down to (2,5), then to (2,4) but occupied, so to (3,5), then to (3,4) occupied, etc., it might take many turns.\n\nDistance from (1,6) to (1,1) is 5 cells down, so at least 5 moves, but with obstacles, more.\n\nOn turn 28 after eating (1,6), I'm at (1,6), turn 29 to (2,6), turn 30 to (2,5), turn 31 to (2,4) but if (2,4) is body, I can't, so I have to go to (3,5) or something, then turn 31 to (3,4) if free, but (3,4) might be body, so it's messy.\n\nLet's list the positions after turn 28 when I eat (1,6).\n\nAssume I go from (2,4) down to (2,3) on turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: move D to (2,3)\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)  ( (6,2) gone)\n\nTurn 25: move L to (1,3)  (left to (1,3))\n\nHead direction D, so can move left.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)\n\nTurn 26: move D to (1,2)  (down to (1,2))\n\nPositions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 27: move D to (1,1), eat food (1,1)\n\nNew head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 28: from (1,1), move R to (2,1) as before, since only choice.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n\nNow, for (1,6), it is available until turn 28, so on turn 28, I need to move to (1,6) to eat it, but I'm moving to (2,1), so I can't.\n\n(1,6) will be gone after turn 28.\n\nSo I missed it.\n\nIf on turn 25, from (1,3) I go up to (1,4) instead of down, then to (1,5) turn 26, to (1,6) turn 27 eat.\n\nBut then I miss (1,1) for now, but (1,1) has longer life, so I can go for it later.\n\nAfter eating (1,6) on turn 27, head at (1,6), then turn 28 move to (2,6), turn 29 from (2,6) move down to (2,5), turn 30 to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, cannot, so move to (3,5) or something, then down to (3,4) occupied, etc., to reach (1,1) by turn 31.\n\nFrom turn 27 to 31, 4 turns, distance 5, possible but tight.\n\nFor example, from (1,6) turn 27, to (2,6) turn 28, to (2,5) turn 29, to (2,4) not possible, so to (3,5) turn 29, then to (3,4) not possible, to (4,5) or (3,6), but I need to go down.\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 28, I can go down to (2,5) turn 29, then from (2,5) I can only go right to (3,5) as before, then from (3,5) to (3,4) not possible, to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nSay to (3,4) is occupied, so to (4,5) turn 30, then to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, cannot, to (5,5) or (4,6), not down.\n\nI'm not getting closer to (1,1).\n\nTo go down, I need to go to the right first to avoid the body, but it takes time.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) turn 28, go right to (3,6) turn 29, then down to (3,5) turn 30, then down to (3,4) but on turn 30, (3,4) might be free if the body moved.\n\nLet's track the body.\n\nAfter turn 27: ate (1,6), positions head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail (5,1)\n\nTurn 28: move R to (2,6): head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nTurn 29: from (2,6), say move R to (3,6): head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\n(4,1) gone.\n\nTurn 30: from (3,6), move D to (3,5): head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 31: from (3,5), move D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, cannot. Move L to (2,5), or R to (4,5), U to (3,6) body, cannot.\n\nHead direction D? From (3,6) to (3,5) is down, so head direction D.\n\nSo can move down, but (3,4) occupied, so cannot. Left to (2,5), or right to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) and (4,5) free.\n\nSay move to (2,5) or (4,5).\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), I'm at (3,5), still far, and turn 31 is the last turn to eat (1,1), life span 1.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (1,1) is at least 4 moves: left to (2,5) but (2,5) not directly, to (2,5) then (2,4) occupied, so not possible in one turn.\n\nI can't reach (1,1) by turn 31 from here.\n\nSo if I go for (1,6) first, I can eat it, but I may not be able to eat (1,1) later due to the body blocking the way.\n\nIf I go for (1,1) first, I eat it but miss (1,6).\n\nSo I need to choose which one to eat.\n\nBut both are positive, so I should try to eat both if possible.\n\nPerhaps from the current position, I can go in a way that I can reach both.\n\nAnother initial move: at turn 24, go up to (2,5), then left to (1,5) turn 25, then to (1,6) turn 26 eat.\n\nThen from (1,6), turn 27 to (2,6), then turn 28 from (2,6) I can go down to (2,5), but then to (2,4) occupied, so go right to (3,6), etc., same as before.\n\nBut to reach (1,1), it's hard.\n\nPerhaps after eating (1,6), I can go down the right side.\n\nBut let's see the grid size; it's small, 8x8, snake length 10 after eating, so space is tight.\n\nI could avoid eating for a few turns to move the body and free up space.\n\nFor example, at turn 24, go down to (2,3), then to (2,2) or (1,3), etc., to position for (1,1) later.\n\nBut then (1,6) might expire.\n\nSince (1,6) has shorter life span, I should prioritize eating it first.\n\nThen for (1,1), I can try to reach it if possible, but from the simulation, it seems difficult, so I might not get it, but at least I get one food.\n\nIf I go for (1,1) first, I get it but miss (1,6), same thing.\n\nBut (1,6) is available sooner and expires sooner, so it's more critical to eat it.\n\nMoreover, from the current position, going for (1,6) is safer because after eating, I have an escape route to the right.\n\nFor (1,1), after eating, I'm cornered and have to go right, but there's a wall at (3,1), so I can only go up, but the body might be there.\n\nIn the (1,1) first scenario, after eating, I go to (2,1), then to (2,2), then I can go up or right.\n\nBut at (2,2), I can go up to (2,3) or right to (3,2), etc.\n\nThe body is at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), etc., so (2,3) might be free, so I can go up.\n\nBut to get to the other food, it's far.\n\nWhereas with (1,6) first, I can perhaps eat both if I act fast.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum turns to reach (1,1) from after eating (1,6).\n\nAfter eating (1,6) on turn 26, head at (1,6).\n\nTurn 27: move R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,5)  (assume I go down)\n\nTurn 29: from (2,5), only can move R to (3,5)  (since (2,4) occupied, (1,5) occupied, (2,6) reverse)\n\nMove to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: from (3,5), can move D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, cannot; move L to (2,5) body, cannot; move R to (4,5) or U to (3,6)\n\nSay move to (4,5)\n\nTurn 31: from (4,5), can move L to (3,5) body, cannot; D to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, cannot; R to (5,5), U to (4,6), etc.\n\nNot to (1,1).\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 30, if I move U to (3,6), then turn 31 to (3,7) invalid, or to (2,6) body, etc.\n\nNo way to reach (1,1) by turn 31.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat both if I eat (1,6) first and then try for (1,1), because the body blocks the direct path and I have to go around, taking too many turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (1,1) first, I can't reach (1,6) by turn 28.\n\nSo I can only eat one of them.\n\nTherefore, I should choose to eat the one with shorter life span first, which is (1,6), available until turn 28, while (1,1) until turn 31.\n\nSo eat (1,6) first.\n\nThen for the sequence, at turn 24, I should move towards (1,6).\n\nFrom (2,4), the fastest way is to go left or up.\n\nGo left to (1,4) or up to (2,5).\n\nIf I go left to (1,4), then up to (1,5) turn 25, up to (1,6) turn 26.\n\nIf I go up to (2,5), then left to (1,5) turn 25, up to (1,6) turn 26.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut going left first might be better because (1,4) is closer to the food path.\n\nGoing up to (2,5) might leave more options.\n\nBut in both cases, I end up at (1,6) on turn 26.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive and perhaps eat other food if available, but currently only two foods, both will be gone after their span.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), I can explore to find new food, but the state doesn't say new food spawns, so I think only these foods are present.\n\nThe input only gives current foods, so I assume no new food spawns; I need to eat these.\n\nSince I can only eat one, I eat (1,6) and forget about (1,1).\n\nThen for long-term survival, after eating, I need to move to open space.\n\nSo let's go with the sequence.\n\nAt turn 24, move L to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (1,6) eat food\n\nThen turn 27: move R to (2,6) (only choice)\n\nTurn 28: from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6)\n\nTo avoid being trapped, go to (3,6) to have more space.\n\nMove R to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,6), I can move U to (3,7) invalid, D to (3,5), L to (2,6) body, cannot, R to (4,6)\n\nSo D to (3,5) or R to (4,6)\n\nSay move D to (3,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead from turn 24.\n\nSo turns 24 to 28 or 29.\n\nSince turn 24 to 28 is 5 turns.\n\nt1=24, so turns 24,25,26,27,28.\n\n5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have:\n\nTurn 24: L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 25: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 26: U to (1,6) eat\n\nTurn 27: R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 28: from (2,6), move to (3,6) or (2,5)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nTo maximize survival, go to (3,6) to go right.\n\nThen later I can go down.\n\nBut for now, since only up to turn 28 in the plan, I can choose.\n\nBut in turn 28, moving to (2,5) might be riskier because from (2,5) I can only go right to (3,5), while from (3,6) I can go down or right.\n\nSo better to go to (3,6) on turn 28.\n\nBut at turn 28, from (2,6), head direction R (after moving right on turn 27), so at turn 28, from (2,6), possible moves: D to (2,5), R to (3,6)\n\nCannot move left or up.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), then head direction R.\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,6), can move D to (3,5), U invalid, L to (2,6) body, cannot, R to (4,6)\n\nSo D or R.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should output turns 24 to 28.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 26 I eat, so score increases.\n\nNow, for the other food at (1,1), I won't eat it, but that's fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if there's a way to eat both, but I think it's not possible with the time and body.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 24, go down to (2,3), then to (1,3), then on turn 26, I can choose to go up to (1,4) for (1,6) or down to (1,2) for (1,1).\n\nBut I have to commit.\n\nFor example, at turn 24: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 25: L to (1,3)\n\nThen at turn 26, I can go U to (1,4) for (1,6) or D to (1,2) for (1,1).\n\nIf I go U to (1,4) on turn 26, then turn 27 U to (1,5), turn 28 U to (1,6) eat on turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, if go D to (1,2) on turn 26, then turn 27 D to (1,1) eat.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat one on turn 28.\n\nWith the first approach, I eat on turn 26, earlier, so better to eat sooner to have the length increase earlier for potential more food, but no more food mentioned.\n\nSo either way.\n\nBut with turn 24 left or up, I eat on turn 26, with down, I eat on turn 28, so earlier is better to secure the food.\n\nAlso, with shorter life span, eating earlier reduces risk of not reaching due to obstacles.\n\nSo I think going for (1,6) directly is best.\n\nTherefore, sequence:\n\nTurn 24: L\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nThen turn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: R (to (3,6))\n\nIn turn 28, I move R to (3,6).\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction.\n\nAfter turn 26 move U to (1,6), head direction U.\n\nTurn 27 move R to (2,6), head direction R.\n\nTurn 28 move R to (3,6), head direction R.\n\nThen turn 29, I can move D or R, but not in the plan.\n\nFor 5 turns: turns 24 to 28.\n\nActions: 24:L, 25:U, 26:U, 27:R, 28:R\n\nIn 28:R, to (3,6).\n\nI could move D to (2,5), but R is better for space.\n\nNow, about the food at (1,1), I don't eat it, but it has life span 8, so it will be there for a while, but I may not reach it, so I ignore it for now.\n\nSurvival is key.\n\nIn the initial position, after moving, the area might be safer.\n\nSo I think this is ok.\n\nThe answer format should be boxed with the actions.\n\nSo for turn 24: L\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: R\n\nBut turn 28 is the fifth action.\n\nt1=24, so turns 24,25,26,27,28.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (1,6) with a limited life span (available until turn 28) while ensuring long-term survival, the plan prioritizes reaching this food quickly by turn 26. The food at (1,1) has a longer life span (until turn 31) but is riskier to pursue due to potential body blockades and the snake's position after eating (1,6). After eating (1,6), the snake moves right to avoid the top-left corner and create space for future moves. The sequence below covers 5 turns (turns 24 to 28) as required.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- **Immediate Goal (Turns 24-26)**: Head towards (1,6) via the shortest path:\n  - Turn 24: Move left (L) to (1,4) to align with the food column.\n  - Turn 25: Move up (U) to (1,5) to approach the food.\n  - Turn 26: Move up (U) to (1,6) to eat the food (score +1, length increases by 1).\n- **Post-Eating Maneuver (Turns 27-28)**: Escape the corner and avoid collisions:\n  - Turn 27: Move right (R) to (2,6) (only safe move; left and up are blocked by body/wall, down is invalid due to direction).\n  - Turn 28: Move right (R) to (3,6) to access open space on the right, avoiding potential traps near the body.\n- **Long-Term Considerations**: \n  - The food at (1,1) is not pursued, as reaching it by turn 31 is unlikely after eating (1,6) due to body blockades and distance. Instead, the focus is on survival by moving to less congested areas.\n  - After turn 28, the snake can continue right or down to explore for new food while avoiding walls and body collisions.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No instant reverse is violated (e.g., after moving left on turn 24, right is not chosen on turn 25).\n  - Collisions are avoided: all moves are to free cells, and the tail moves away as expected.\n  - The \"Tail Reward Danger\" is irrelevant here, as the tail is never adjacent to the head during this sequence.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 25: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 26: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 27: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 28: R (right)\n}",

        "score": 8,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 25, and I have to plan the next moves for the snake. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7. So, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the snake can move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (3,1) which is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,4), and the body follows: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). Head direction is L, which is left, so it's moving west.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (3,1) blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (1,4)\n\n- Body: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo the snake is long; it has 9 segments. From (1,4) to (6,1), with a bend at (4,4) going down to (4,1), then right to (6,1).\n\nHead is at (1,4), moving left. But x=1, so moving left would go to (0,4), but x=0 is a wall, so it can't move left. That's a problem.\n\nCurrent head direction is L (left), and head is at (1,4). Moving left would be to (0,4), which is x=0, a wall. So if it tries to move left, it would hit the wall and die. But the AI has to choose a safe move.\n\nThe action is chosen by me, so I shouldn't choose left. Since head direction is given as L, but I can change direction each turn, with the constraint that I can't instantly reverse. Since current direction is left, I can't move right immediately; that would be reverse. Possible moves from current position: up, down, left, but left is into wall, so invalid.\n\nAvailable moves from (1,4):\n\n- Up: (1,5) - y+1\n\n- Down: (1,3) - y-1\n\n- Left: (0,4) - wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,4) - but (2,4) is occupied by the body? Snake positions: (1,4) head, then (2,4) is the first body segment. So moving right to (2,4) would cause collision with body, since it's occupied now.\n\nMovement constraints: body collision if head touches any body segment. But note, it can move into the tail cell because the tail moves, so it might be safe if it's the tail.\n\nLet's see the snake positions: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n\nSo the tail is at (6,1).\n\nIf I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it might be okay if the tail moves away when the head moves there.\n\nGeneral rule: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail is removed, unless food is eaten, in which case tail is not removed, so length increases.\n\nBut for collision: head cannot touch any body segment except that it can touch the tail segment if the tail is moving away.\n\nIn this case, from (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (1,5): is this free? Let's see what's at (1,5). No food mentioned, and not in snake positions? Snake positions: all y=4,3,2,1 except head at (1,4), body at (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), then (4,3), etc. So (1,5) is not occupied. Is it a wall? x=1, y=5, walls only at borders, y=5 is not 0 or 7, so should be free. Internal obstacles: (3,1), not (1,5). So (1,5) should be empty.\n\n- Down to (1,3): similarly, (1,3) not in snake positions, not wall, should be empty.\n\n- Left to (0,4): wall, invalid.\n\n- Right to (2,4): but (2,4) is the first body segment, occupied now. If I move there, head touches body, collision, death. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, only possible moves are Up or Down.\n\nCurrent direction is L, but since I'm changing direction, I need to consider no instant reverse. Current direction is left, so reverse would be right. But right is invalid anyway, so no issue. Up and down are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSo from (1,4), I can go Up to (1,5) or Down to (1,3).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (1,6): life span 4, value 1. At (1,6), which is top-left, but x=1, y=6. y=6 is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, playable. Similarly, (1,1) and (6,6).\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\n(1,1) at x=1,y=1.\n\n(6,6) at x=6,y=6.\n\nLife spans: (1,6) has life 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 25, life=4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, i.e., on turn 29 it will be gone? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So on the turn it reaches 0, it is still there, but after that turn, it's gone? I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life L, then after the turn, L decreases by 1. If L=1, after this turn, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6) at turn 25, life=4, so it will be present for turns 25,26,27,28, and disappear after turn 28, so not available on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life=7, so available until turn 25+7-1=31? Let's calculate.\n\nIf at turn t, life=L, then:\n\n- After turn t, life becomes L-1\n\n- After turn t+1, life L-2\n\n- ...\n\n- When life=1, after that turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for food with life L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1. On turn t+L, it is gone.\n\nFor (1,6): life=4 at turn 25, so can be eaten on turns 25,26,27,28. Gone on turn 29.\n\n(1,1): life=7 at turn 25, can be eaten turns 25 to 31 (25+6=31? Turns: 25,26,27,28,29,30,31, that's 7 turns: 25 to 31 inclusive is 7 turns, yes.\n\n25 to 31 is 7 days, but from turn 25 to turn 31 is 7 turns: t=25,26,27,28,29,30,31.\n\nAt turn 31, life would be 7 - (31-25) = 7-6=1, so after turn 31, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 31.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life=10, available turns 25 to 34.\n\nNow, back to the snake. Head at (1,4), can go up to (1,5) or down to (1,3).\n\nIf I go up to (1,5), then I'm closer to (1,6), which has short life, only 4 turns left.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so from (1,5), I could go up to (1,6) next turn, but need to see if it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (1,3), I'm closer to (1,1), but (1,1) has longer life.\n\nAlso, there's (6,6) far away.\n\nBut snake is long, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate move: up or down.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (1,5)\n\nThen head at (1,5). From there, I can go up to (1,6), but (1,6) has food. If I go to (1,6) on turn 26, I eat the food, but is it safe?\n\nSpecial case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (6,1). (1,6) and (6,1) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (1,6) and (1,5) or (2,6), etc., not (6,1). So no issue with tail.\n\nBut when I eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. But collision might happen with other body parts.\n\nIf I move to (1,5) on turn 25, then on turn 26, if I move to (1,6), I eat the food.\n\nNow, what happens: head moves to (1,6), which was empty or has food. (1,6) has food, so I eat it, value +1, length increases. The new head position is (1,6), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows.\n\nCurrent snake positions before moving: let's denote.\n\nTurn 25 start: snake: H(1,4), B1(2,4), B2(3,4), B3(4,4), B4(4,3), B5(4,2), B6(4,1), B7(5,1), T(6,1)\n\nAfter move up: head to (1,5), then the body: B1 moves to old head (1,4), B2 to (2,4), ..., T to (5,1)? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo after moving up to (1,5):\n\n- New head: (1,5)\n\n- Then B1 moves to (1,4)  // old head position\n\n- B2 moves to (2,4)  // old B1 position\n\n- B3 moves to (3,4)  // old B2\n\n- B4 moves to (4,4)  // old B3\n\n- B5 moves to (4,3)  // old B4\n\n- B6 moves to (4,2)  // old B5\n\n- B7 moves to (4,1)  // old B6\n\n- T moves to (5,1)  // old B7 position\n\nOld tail (6,1) is now empty, since tail moved to (5,1).\n\nSnake now: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]  // 9 segments, same length, no food eaten.\n\nNow, on turn 26, I can move from (1,5) to (1,6) to eat the food.\n\nMove up to (1,6): head to (1,6), which has food, so I eat it. Then, since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new snake: head (1,6), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), and tail stays, so now 10 segments, with tail still at (5,1)? Positions: new head (1,6), then the previous head (1,5) becomes first body, then (1,4), etc., up to (5,1), and since ate, no tail removal, so tail is still (5,1), but now it's part of the body, and the last segment is (5,1), but we add a new segment at the end? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not advance, so the length increases by one. The new tail is the old tail, since tail didn't move.\n\nIn this case: before move, positions: H(1,5), B1(1,4), B2(2,4), ..., B8(4,1), T(5,1)  // B8 is (4,1), T(5,1)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,6) and eating:\n\n- New head: (1,6)\n\n- New body: B1 at old H position (1,5)\n\nB2 at old B1 (1,4)\n\nB3 at old B2 (2,4)\n\n...\n\nB8 at old B7? Let's index properly.\n\nBefore turn 26 move: snake: segment 0: (1,5) head, seg1: (1,4), seg2: (2,4), seg3: (3,4), seg4: (4,4), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (4,2), seg7: (4,1), seg8: (5,1) tail\n\nAfter move up to (1,6) and eat:\n\n- Head moves to (1,6)\n\n- Seg1 moves to old head position (1,5)\n\n- Seg2 moves to old seg1 position (1,4)\n\n- Seg3 moves to old seg2 position (2,4)\n\n- Seg4 to old seg3 (3,4)\n\n- Seg5 to old seg4 (4,4)\n\n- Seg6 to old seg5 (4,3)\n\n- Seg7 to old seg6 (4,2)\n\n- Seg8 (tail) moves to old seg7 position (4,1)\n\nBut since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, so tail stays, and we have a new tail at the position where tail was, but tail moved? No.\n\nStandard: when no eat, tail moves forward, so last position is freed.\n\nWhen eat, tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and we add the new head, so the snake grows by one cell at the head position, but the tail stays, so the new tail is the same as old, but the body extends.\n\nAfter eating, the snake positions are: new head, then the entire previous snake body, including the tail, without removing the tail.\n\nSo in this case: previous positions: head (1,5), body: (1,4), (2,4), ..., (5,1)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,6) and eating:\n\n- New head: (1,6)\n\n- Then the previous head and body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nSo now snake has 10 segments: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTail is at (5,1).\n\nNow, is there collision? Head at (1,6), body at (1,5), (1,4), etc. (1,6) and (1,5) are adjacent, but head is at (1,6), first body at (1,5), which is different cell, so no collision. All positions are unique, so safe.\n\nNow, the food at (1,6) is eaten, so gone.\n\nBut life span was 4, eaten on turn 26, which is within 25-28, fine.\n\nNow, back to turn 25 choice.\n\nIf I go up to (1,5) on turn 25, then I can eat (1,6) on turn 26.\n\nBut after that, I'm at (1,6), which is corner, x=1,y=6.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: down to (1,5), but (1,5) is now body segment. After eating on turn 26, positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), etc.\n\nSo from (1,6), moves:\n\n- Down to (1,5): but (1,5) is occupied by body, so collision, invalid.\n\n- Left: (0,6) wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,6) — is this free? Let's see.\n\n(2,6) is within bounds, x=2,y=6, not wall. Is it occupied? Snake has (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), etc., no (2,6), so should be free, unless food, but no food there.\n\n- Up: (1,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (1,6) is right to (2,6).\n\nThen I go to (2,6), and so on.\n\nBut (1,6) is a dead end after eating, only one way out: right.\n\nIf I don't eat, but I have to move.\n\nAnother option: on turn 25, go down to (1,3) instead.\n\nIf I go down to (1,3) on turn 25.\n\nThen head to (1,3), body moves: B1 to (1,4), B2 to (2,4), etc., T to (5,1), tail (6,1) gone.\n\nSnake: [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go down to (1,2) or left invalid, right to (2,3)? (2,3) not occupied, or up to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, occupied.\n\nMoves from (1,3):\n\n- Up to (1,4): occupied by body, collision\n\n- Down to (1,2): free? (1,2) not in snake, not wall\n\n- Left: (0,3) wall invalid\n\n- Right to (2,3): free\n\nSo can go down or right.\n\n(1,1) has food at (1,1), so going down to (1,2) then (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut need to see if safe.\n\nAlso, (1,6) has short life, if I go down, I might not get to (1,6) in time.\n\nFrom (1,4), if I go down to (1,3), on turn 25.\n\nThen on turn 26, from (1,3), I can go down to (1,2) or right to (2,3).\n\nIf I go down to (1,2), then turn 27, to (1,1) to eat.\n\n(1,1) has food, life 7, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (1,1) is corner, similar issue.\n\nAfter eating at (1,1), head at (1,1), body at (1,2), (1,3), etc.\n\nMoves: up to (1,2) occupied, left wall, down wall (y=1, down to y=0 invalid), so only right to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) might be free.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThere is also (6,6) food with long life.\n\nThe snake is currently in the left part, and (6,6) is far right-top.\n\nTo reach (6,6) from (1,4), it might take many moves.\n\nFor example, from (1,4) to (6,6) is about 5 steps right and 2 up, but with obstacles and body, it might be longer.\n\nBut since (6,6) has life 10, it will be there for 10 turns, so I have time.\n\nBut I need to consider the risk of getting trapped.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,1) might block paths.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 6x6: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders, obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (1,4), body: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo the snake occupies the bottom row from x=4 to6 y=1, and a column at x=4 y=2,3,4, and row at y=4 from x=1 to4, but head at (1,4).\n\nAvailable space: top row y=6, but (1,6) food, (6,6) food.\n\nLeft column x=1, y=3,5,6? y=1 has (1,1) food, but (1,1) is free? Snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but not (1,1), so (1,1) is free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) free with food.\n\n(6,6) free with food.\n\nNow, the area around (1,4) is crowded because of the body.\n\nIf I go up to (1,5), I can quickly eat (1,6) on turn 26, but then I'm stuck at (1,6) with only one move to (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,6), I can go down or right or left, but left to (1,6) might be body, etc.\n\nAfter eating at (1,6) on turn 26, snake at (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nHead at (1,6), then move to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), moves: down to (2,5), right to (3,6), left to (1,6) but (1,6) is body now, occupied, so invalid. Up to (2,7) wall invalid. So down or right.\n\nIf down to (2,5), or right to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) might be free, not occupied.\n\nThen I can explore.\n\nBut the bottom area has the tail at (5,1), and there is food at (1,1) which I could go for later.\n\n(1,1) has life 7, so I can go after.\n\nBut (1,6) has only 4 turns, if I don't eat it now, it might disappear.\n\nIf I go down on turn 25 to (1,3), then I can eat (1,1) soon.\n\nTurn 25: move down to (1,3)\n\nSnake: [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]  // tail at (5,1), (6,1) gone.\n\nThen turn 26: from (1,3), I can go down to (1,2)  (assuming free)\n\nThen turn 27: down to (1,1) to eat food.\n\nSo eat (1,1) on turn 27.\n\nThen snake grows, head at (1,1), body: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), etc., tail at (5,1) or something.\n\nPositions after eating (1,1): head (1,1), then previous positions: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // 10 segments.\n\nFrom (1,1), only move right to (2,1), since up, left, down invalid.\n\n(2,1) : is it free? Not occupied, not wall, but obstacle at (3,1), so (2,1) is free.\n\nMove to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go up, down, or right, but right to (3,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nUp to (2,2), down to (2,0) invalid, so only up to (2,2) if free.\n\n(2,2) not occupied, should be free.\n\nSo go to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go up, down, left, right.\n\nLeft to (1,2) occupied, down to (2,1) occupied, so up to (2,3) or right to (3,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I missed (1,6) food, which by turn 27 might be gone if not eaten. Life 4 at turn 25, so on turn 27, life left: after turn 25, life=3, after turn 26, life=2, after turn 27, life=1, so on turn 28, it can be eaten, but after turn 28, gone.\n\nIf I eat on turn 26 as in first option, I get it.\n\nIf I go down on turn 25, I might not get to (1,6) in time.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (1,6) is two steps up: turn 25 to (1,5), turn 26 to (1,6).\n\nIf I go down to (1,3) on turn 25, then to get to (1,6), I need to go up to (1,4) but on turn 26, (1,4) is occupied if I moved down, so I can't go back easily.\n\nAfter moving down to (1,3) on turn 25, snake at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), etc., so (1,4) is body.\n\nOn turn 26, from (1,3), I can only go down or right, not up, because (1,4) occupied.\n\nSo to reach (1,6), I need to go around, which takes more turns, and (1,6) disappears after turn 28, so by turn 29 gone.\n\nFrom (1,3), if I go right to (2,3) on turn 26, then to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, or (2,5), etc., it might take several turns to reach (1,6), and with only 2 turns left (turn 27 and 28), it might be tight or impossible.\n\nFor example, shortest path: from (1,3) to (1,6): but (1,4) blocked, so need via (2,3), (2,4) occupied, (2,5), (1,5), (1,6) or something.\n\n(2,4) is occupied until the snake moves.\n\nOn turn 26, if at (1,3), go to (2,3) — free.\n\nThen snake: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // after move to (2,3), body: B1 to (1,3), B2 to (1,4), B3 to (2,4), etc.\n\n(1,4) is still body, (2,4) is body.\n\nFrom (2,3), moves: up to (2,4) occupied, down to (2,2), left to (1,3) occupied, right to (3,3) — free? (3,3) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nObstacle at (3,1), not (3,3).\n\nSo can go down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nTo reach (1,6), need to go up, but (2,4) occupied, so must go via (3,3), (3,4) occupied, (3,5), etc. Long way.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,6) minimum 3 moves, e.g., (2,3)->(3,3)->(3,4) but (3,4) occupied, so (3,3)->(3,2) down, then (4,2) occupied, messy.\n\nIt might not be reachable in 2 turns (turn 27 and 28).\n\nOn turn 26, after moving to (2,3), the food at (1,6) has life: after turn 26, life=2 (since started 4, after t25:3, after t26:2), so can be eaten on turn 27 or 28.\n\nBut from (2,3) on turn 26, to (1,6) in one move? No, not adjacent.\n\n(2,3) to (1,6) is |dx|=1, |dy|=3, not adjacent.\n\nShortest path: e.g., (2,3) to (2,4) but occupied, to (1,3) occupied, so must go to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nSay to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (3,4) occupied, to (3,2) or (4,3) occupied, to (2,3) occupied, so to (3,4) not possible, to (4,3) occupied, so only (3,2) or (4,3) invalid, so (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), to (3,3) occupied, to (4,2) occupied, to (3,1) obstacle, to (2,2), etc. Stuck in bottom area.\n\nActually, from (2,3), the only free moves are to (2,2) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nFrom (3,3), moves: up to (3,4) but (3,4) is body segment, occupied. Down to (3,2), left to (2,3) occupied, right to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied. So only down to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) : is it free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nThen from (3,2), similarly, surrounded or occupied.\n\nThis is getting messy; the snake body is blocking the way to top.\n\nTherefore, if I don't go for (1,6) immediately, I might not be able to eat it at all, since it has short life.\n\nWhereas (1,1) has longer life, and (6,6) longer.\n\nSo for maximizing score, eating (1,6) is time-sensitive, so I should prioritize it.\n\nMoreover, by eating it, I get +1 and grow, which might help in long run, but also makes snake longer, harder to maneuever.\n\nBut in this case, since it's available and short-lived, I should go for it.\n\nNow, about the move: on turn 25, move up to (1,5).\n\nThen on turn 26, move up to (1,6) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (1,6), only move right to (2,6).\n\nNow, after eating on turn 26, snake at (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nHead at (1,6), move to (2,6) on turn 27.\n\nThen snake: head to (2,6), body: B1 to old head (1,6), B2 to (1,5), B3 to (1,4), B4 to (2,4), etc., tail to (4,1) or something.\n\nAfter move to (2,6): new head (2,6), then body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail at (4,1), since no eat, tail moved from (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nPositions before turn 27 move: H(1,6), B1(1,5), B2(1,4), B3(2,4), B4(3,4), B5(4,4), B6(4,3), B7(4,2), B8(4,1), T(5,1)\n\nAfter moving to (2,6): head (2,6), B1 to (1,6), B2 to (1,5), B3 to (1,4), B4 to (2,4), B5 to (3,4), B6 to (4,4), B7 to (4,3), B8 to (4,2), T to (4,1)  // (5,1) freed.\n\nNow head at (2,6), I need to plan next moves.\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- Up: (2,7) wall invalid\n\n- Down: (2,5) — free? Not occupied, not wall\n\n- Left: (1,6) occupied by body\n\n- Right: (3,6) — free? (3,6) not occupied\n\nSo can go down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\nNow, there is food at (6,6), which is far, but life 10, so I can head that way.\n\nAlso, (1,1) food, but life 7, still time.\n\nFrom (2,6), going right to (3,6) gets me closer to (6,6).\n\nGoing down to (2,5) might lead to other areas.\n\nBut I should think about long-term path to other food.\n\nThe area around (4,1) to (6,1) is occupied, but as snake moves, it frees up.\n\nCurrently, after turn 27, tail is at (4,1), which might move.\n\nBut (1,1) is still there, I could go south.\n\nBut (1,1) has life 7, at turn 27, life left: original life 7 at turn 25, after 2 turns (t25 and t26), life=5, so available until turn 31.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life=10 at t25, at t27, life=8, available until turn 34.\n\nNow, from (2,6), I can go to (3,6), then to (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) to eat, but need to see if path clear.\n\n(4,6) might be free, (5,6), (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is food.\n\nBut on the way, (4,4) to (4,1) are body segments, but as snake moves, they shift.\n\nFor example, if I go right to (3,6) on turn 27.\n\nThen from (3,6), can go down to (3,5) or right to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan all, since I only need to think 5+ turns ahead, but for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions or until a decision point.\n\nBut I can output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on the first few moves.\n\nSince (1,6) is critical, I should go up on turn 25.\n\nThen the sequence could be:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U (to eat (1,6))\n\nThen turn 27: R (to (2,6))\n\nNow from there, I need to choose.\n\nBut let's consider if going down on turn 25 is better for long-term.\n\nIf I go down to (1,3) on turn 25, then I can eat (1,1) on turn 27, as before.\n\nBut I lose (1,6) food, so score -1.\n\nWith going up, I get +1 from (1,6), and can still get (1,1) or (6,6).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), after eating (1,6), I'm at (2,6) on turn 27.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (1,1) is far, e.g., (2,6) to (2,1) then (1,1), but (2,1) might be accessible.\n\nBut (1,1) life until turn 31, at turn 27, I have 4 turns to get there: turns 28,29,30,31.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (1,1): min |dx|=1, |dy|=5, but with obstacles, need to go down.\n\nFor example, (2,6) to (2,5) to (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, to (3,5) etc., but body might move.\n\nIt might be possible, but riskier.\n\nWhereas (6,6) is closer from (2,6).\n\n(2,6) to (6,6) is x from 2 to 6, y same, so 4 steps right: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6).\n\nNow, are these cells free?\n\nCurrently, at turn 27, after moving to (2,6), positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // from earlier.\n\nSo (3,6) is free, (4,6) free, (5,6) free, (6,6) free with food.\n\n(3,4) is body, but (3,6) is different.\n\nSo I can move right to (3,6) on turn 27.\n\nThen to (4,6) on turn 28.\n\nThen to (5,6) on turn 29.\n\nThen to (6,6) on turn 30 to eat.\n\n(6,6) life=10 at turn 25, at turn 30, life=10 - (30-25) = 5, still available, and after turn 30, life=4, so can eat on turn 30.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) I can go after, but it might be tight.\n\nSince I ate (1,6), I have 10 segments, so larger snake, but as long as I have space, it should be ok.\n\nNow, back to turn 25 decision.\n\nI think going up to get the time-sensitive food is better.\n\nMoreover, if I go down, I might get stuck in the bottom with the obstacle.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), if I go down to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2), but (3,1) obstacle, so I have to go up or right.\n\nBut it might be fine, but I miss (1,6).\n\nSo I think U on turn 25 is better.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe core rules say to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nLet me outline a plan.\n\nTurn 25: move Up to (1,5)\n\nTurn 26: move Up to (1,6) to eat food\n\nTurn 27: move Right to (2,6)  // only choice\n\nNow from (2,6), as above, I can go to (6,6) to eat that food.\n\nBut on turn 27 at (2,6), I can move down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\nIf I go right to (3,6), towards (6,6).\n\nMove to (3,6) on turn 27.\n\nThen turn 28: to (4,6)\n\nTurn 29: to (5,6)\n\nTurn 30: to (6,6) eat.\n\nNow, what about (1,1)? At turn 30, (1,1) life: at turn 25 life=7, after 5 turns (25-29), life=2, so on turn 30 and 31 can eat.\n\nFrom (6,6) on turn 30, to (1,1) is far, min 5 steps left and 5 down, but y from 6 to 1, dx=5, dy=5, but with obstacles, and snake body, it might not be reachable in 2 turns.\n\nFor example, from (6,6) to (1,1) directly not possible, need to go left and down.\n\nBut on turn 30, after eating at (6,6), head at (6,6), body behind.\n\nTo reach (1,1) by turn 31, I need to be there on turn 31.\n\nBut from (6,6) on turn 30, to (1,1) in one turn? Impossible.\n\nTurn 31 is the last chance, so I need to be at (1,1) on turn 31.\n\nBut on turn 30, I'm at (6,6), so unless I move instantly, I can't.\n\nSo I won't be able to eat (1,1) if I go to (6,6).\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,6), I should consider going down towards (1,1) instead of right to (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 27, I can move down to (2,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go further down to reach (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (2,5) on turn 27.\n\nThen snake positions: head to (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail at (4,2) or something.\n\nAfter move to (2,5): new head (2,5), B1 to (2,6), B2 to (1,6), B3 to (1,5), B4 to (1,4), B5 to (2,4), B6 to (3,4), B7 to (4,4), B8 to (4,3), T to (4,2)  // (4,1) freed? Before move: H(2,6)? No, on turn 27 before move, head was at (1,6) moving to (2,6)? Let's clarify turns.\n\nAfter turn 26: snake at (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) but (5,1) is tail, but when we moved to (2,6) on turn 27, tail moved.\n\nSet turn 27 start: positions from after turn 26 move and eat: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (5,1)\n\nMove to (2,6): head to (2,6), then body: seg1 to (1,6), seg2 to (1,5), seg3 to (1,4), seg4 to (2,4), seg5 to (3,4), seg6 to (4,4), seg7 to (4,3), seg8 to (4,2), tail to (4,1)  // (5,1) freed.\n\nSo positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nNow, if move down to (2,5) on turn 27? Turn 27 action is to (2,6), so for turn 28.\n\nTurn 27: moved to (2,6)\n\nNow turn 28: from (2,6), I can move down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\nIf move down to (2,5), then new head (2,5), body: B1 to (2,6), B2 to (1,6), B3 to (1,5), B4 to (1,4), B5 to (2,4), B6 to (3,4), B7 to (4,4), B8 to (4,3), T to (4,2)  // (4,1) freed.\n\nPositions: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move down to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, occupied; left to (1,5) occupied; right to (3,5) — free? (3,5) not occupied; up to (2,6) occupied. So only right to (3,5) or down invalid, so must go right to (3,5).\n\nThen to (3,5), and so on, still not down.\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go left and down, but (1,y) are occupied except possibly lower.\n\n(1,3) and below might be free, but (1,4) occupied, (1,5) occupied, so I can only go down via other columns.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,5) on turn 28, then from (3,5) , can go down to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, occupied; up to (3,6) — free? (3,6) not occupied; left to (2,5) occupied; right to (4,5) — free.\n\nSo go to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nBut not down.\n\nThe body is blocking the direct path down.\n\nIt might take many turns to reach (1,1), and with life span, at turn 28, (1,1) life left: at turn 25 life=7, after 3 turns (25,26,27), life=4, so available turns 28,29,30,31.\n\nFrom (3,5) or wherever, to (1,1) min 4-5 moves, possible, but with snake, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, from current position at turn 28, if at (3,5), to (1,1): e.g., (3,5)->(3,4) occupied, so (3,5)->(4,5)->(4,4) occupied, (4,5)->(5,5)->... not efficient.\n\n(3,5)->(2,5) occupied, so must go to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nThen from (4,5), to (4,4) occupied, to (5,5), etc.\n\nHard to reach left-bottom quickly.\n\nTherefore, it might be risky to try for (1,1) after going up.\n\nIf I go down on turn 25, I get (1,1) easily but miss (1,6).\n\n(1,6) and (1,1) both value 1, so same score, but (1,6) is perishable soon, so better to eat it.\n\nMoreover, (6,6) is available later.\n\nAfter eating (1,6) and going to (2,6), I can go to (6,6) as I thought earlier.\n\nThen for (1,1), I might not get it, but since all food same value, I can prioritize based on accessibility.\n\n(1,1) has life 7, but if I'm at (6,6) on turn 30, I can't reach it, so I won't eat it.\n\nBut with the first choice, I eat (1,6), and can eat (6,6), so two foods.\n\nIf I go down, I eat (1,1) and might eat (6,6) later, but (6,6) life 10, so possible.\n\nFrom (1,1) after eating, on turn 27, head at (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2), then to (3,2), etc., to (6,6).\n\nBut (3,1) obstacle, so from (2,1) to (2,2), then to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) but (3,4) occupied initially, but as snake moves, it might free.\n\nFor example, on turn 27, after eating (1,1), snake at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // let's not detail, but it might take many turns to reach (6,6), but with life 10, possible.\n\nBut in terms of number of foods, same, but by going up, I secure the perishable food first.\n\nAlso, in the up path, after (2,6), going to (6,6) is straightforward.\n\nWhereas from bottom, it might be slower.\n\nMoreover, the grid has an obstacle at (3,1), which might block paths in the bottom.\n\nSo I think going up on turn 25 is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 25, action U.\n\nThen for turn 26, U to eat.\n\nTurn 27, R to (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 28, I need to choose: to (3,6) or (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then I can continue to (6,6).\n\nGo to (2,5) might lead to dead end or not efficient.\n\nSince (6,6) is available, I should go for it.\n\nSo turn 28: R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 29: R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 30: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 31: R to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut on turn 31, at (6,6), eat.\n\nNow, is this within 5 turns? From turn 25 to turn 31 is 7 turns, but I need to output from turn 25.\n\nAlso, for (1,1), I don't eat it, but it's ok.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions up to eating (6,6).\n\nBut let's confirm the moves.\n\nAlso, when moving, need to ensure no collision.\n\nFor example, on turn 28, from (2,6) to (3,6): (3,6) should be free, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) on turn 29: at that time, what is occupied?\n\nLet's simulate briefly.\n\nAfter turn 27: positions (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nTurn 28: move to (3,6)\n\nNew head (3,6), body: B1 to (2,6), B2 to (1,6), B3 to (1,5), B4 to (1,4), B5 to (2,4), B6 to (3,4), B7 to (4,4), B8 to (4,3), T to (4,2)  // (4,1) freed\n\nPositions: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nTurn 29: move to (4,6)\n\n(4,6) free? Yes.\n\nNew head (4,6), body: B1 to (3,6), B2 to (2,6), B3 to (1,6), B4 to (1,5), B5 to (1,4), B6 to (2,4), B7 to (3,4), B8 to (4,4), T to (4,3)  // (4,2) freed\n\nPositions: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nTurn 30: move to (5,6)\n\n(5,6) free.\n\nNew head (5,6), body: B1 to (4,6), B2 to (3,6), B3 to (2,6), B4 to (1,6), B5 to (1,5), B6 to (1,4), B7 to (2,4), B8 to (3,4), T to (4,4)  // (4,3) freed\n\nPositions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nTurn 31: move to (6,6)\n\n(6,6) has food, eat it.\n\nNew head (6,6), then body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) and add new segment? Since eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (6,6), then previous head and body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) so 11 segments, tail at (4,4).\n\nAll fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 25 onwards.\n\nThe sequence can be:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: R  (to (3,6))\n\nIn turn 28, from (2,6) to (3,6) is right, yes.\n\nThen turn 29: R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 30: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 31: R to (6,6)\n\nBut I don't need to go that far, but since I planned, I can output up to turn 31 or stop earlier.\n\nThe think ahead is for planning, but output can be the actions for the requested turns.\n\nThe state is at turn 25, I need to output for turn 25, then t25+1, etc.\n\nPerhaps output 5 moves: turn 25 to 29.\n\nBut in turn 29, I'm at (4,6), not eating yet.\n\nSince the food at (6,6) is the goal, I can include.\n\nBut to be concise, I can output from turn 25 to turn 27 or so.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nIt says \"Answer Format: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nNo specified number, so I can output a sequence.\n\nSince I have a plan, I'll output up to eating (6,6).\n\nBut for (1,1), I didn't eat it, but it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps from (2,6) I can go down to get (1,1), but as before, it might not be efficient.\n\nI think the sequence to (6,6) is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nThen to continue to (6,6), turn 28: R (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 29: R (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 30: R (to (5,6))\n\nTurn 31: R (to (6,6))\n\nBut turn 31 is t25+6.\n\nI can stop at turn 29 or 30.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, from turn 25, 5 turns: turn 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo up to turn 29.\n\nAt turn 29, if I go to (4,6), not eaten, but that's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 28 R to (3,6), turn 29 R to (4,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,6) and (6,6) later.\n\nBut for output, I'll do turn 25 to 29.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: R\n\nTurn 29: R\n\nAll right moves except first two up.\n\nBut in turn 28 and 29, moving right.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 27, I moved R to (2,6), then turn 28 R to (3,6), turn 29 R to (4,6).\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is a good plan.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes eating the time-sensitive positive food at (1,6) with a life span of 4 (available only until turn 28) while avoiding collisions and dead ends. After securing this food, the snake heads toward the positive food at (6,6) with a longer life span of 10 (available until turn 34), ensuring a second +1 score. The food at (1,1) with life span 7 is not prioritized due to the snake's position and the risk of missing (6,6) if diverted. The sequence below is planned for 5 turns (turns 25-29), with actions ensuring safety and efficiency:\n\n- **Turn 25**: Move Up (U) to (1,5). This avoids the wall and body collision, positioning the snake to reach (1,6) next turn.\n- **Turn 26**: Move Up (U) to (1,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 10). This is safe as (1,6) is not adjacent to the tail, and no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 27**: Move Right (R) to (2,6). This is the only safe move from (1,6), avoiding walls and body segments.\n- **Turn 28**: Move Right (R) to (3,6). This continues the path toward (6,6) with no immediate risks.\n- **Turn 29**: Move Right (R) to (4,6). This further advances toward (6,6), with the food still available for future turns.\n\n### Reasoning Details:\n- **Turn 25 Choice (U vs. D)**: Moving Up to (1,5) is optimal to reach (1,6) before it disappears (life span 4). Moving Down to (1,3) risks missing (1,6) due to body blockages and the short life span.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reverses. For example, after eating (1,6), moving Right to (2,6) is the only safe exit from the corner.\n- **Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns)**: \n  - Turns 25-26: Secure (1,6) for immediate +1.\n  - Turns 27-29: Begin efficient path to (6,6) (estimated arrival by turn 31). \n  - Post-turn 29: Continue to (5,6) on turn 30 and (6,6) on turn 31 for another +1. (1,1) is not targeted as it would require a long detour with low success probability by turn 31 (its last available turn).\n- **Grid and Collision Checks**: \n  - The path to (6,6) is clear: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6) are free and safe based on the snake's body movement (e.g., by turn 28, body segments shift, freeing space).\n  - No Tail Reward Danger: (1,6) and (6,6) are never adjacent to the tail during eating.\n\nThis plan scores +1 by turn 26 and positions the snake for a second +1 by turn 31, with survival ensured through turn 29 and beyond.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: R \\\\\nTurn 28: R \\\\\nTurn 29: R\n}",

    {
        "step": 26,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 26, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are there, I can't move to those cells. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,5), then body segments: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to get to (1,5), so from (1,4) to (1,5).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 3, value +1 (since it's positive food, I assume, as value isn't specified but from context, positive food has +1)\n\nThe food is given as (x,y, life_span, value). So:\n\n- (1,6,3,1) → position (1,6), life span 3, value +1\n\n- (1,1,6,1) → (1,1), life span 6, value +1\n\n- (6,6,9,1) → (6,6), life span 9, value +1\n\nAll are positive food with value 1.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including the current turn. So at turn 26, for (1,6), life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, (1,6) at turn 26 with life span 3: it will be there for turn 26, 27, 28, and disappear at turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) with life span 6: present from turn 26 to 31, disappear at 32.\n\n(6,6) with life span 9: present from 26 to 34, disappear at 35.\n\nNow, snake head is at (1,5), direction Up. So I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is Up, so I cannot move Down instantly, because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite to Up, so not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nBody: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nI should sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nLet me make a small grid. Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNow snake:\n\n- (1,5): head\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,1) — but (4,1) is above y=0? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row? y=0 is wall, so cells from y=1 to y=6? No.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, meaning those coordinates are inaccessible. So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are accessible? But in the snake positions, we have (5,1), which is x=5, y=1, and y=1 is not wall, y=0 is wall. Similarly, y=6 is accessible? Food at (1,6), y=6.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=1 to y=6 are accessible. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6 accessible.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 accessible.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\n- Head: (1,5)\n\n- Then: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is bottom row, accessible.\n\n(5,1) similarly.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (1,6): x=1,y=6, top row? y=6 is accessible, since y=7 is wall.\n\ny=6 is the top row of playable area.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1): x=1,y=1, bottom row.\n\n(6,6): x=6,y=6, top-right corner.\n\nHead at (1,5), which is left side, y=5.\n\nCurrent direction Up, so if I move Up, to (1,6), which has food! (1,6) has food with value +1.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe to eat it.\n\nFirst, what are the possible moves from (1,5):\n\n- Up: to (1,6)\n\n- Down: to (1,4), but (1,4) is a body segment? Snake positions: head (1,5), then (1,4) is the first body segment. If I move down to (1,4), that would be colliding with body, which is deadly.\n\nBut in snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so if you move to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move down to (1,4), which is currently occupied by the body, but specifically, it's the segment that will become the new tail or something?\n\nLet's see the snake: positions in order: index 0: head (1,5), index 1: (1,4), index 2: (2,4), ..., index 8: (5,1)\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail is removed, so if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it should be fine, because the tail moves away.\n\nBut (1,4) is not the tail; the tail is (5,1). (1,4) is the second segment, directly behind head.\n\nIf I move down to (1,4), since (1,4) is a body segment and not the tail, moving there would cause the head to collide with body immediately, which is deadly.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment is deadly unless it is the tail segment.\n\nHere, (1,4) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is (5,1). So moving to (1,4) would be collision with body, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving left: from (1,5), left would be (0,5), but x=0 is wall, so I can't move left, wall collision.\n\nMoving right: to (2,5)\n\nMoving up: to (1,6)\n\nMoving down: to (1,4), but deadly as above.\n\nSo possible safe moves: Up to (1,6) or Right to (2,5)\n\nNow, (1,6) has food, so I could eat it.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving up to (1,6).\n\nIf I move up to (1,6), I eat the food there, since it's present. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so new head at (1,6), and tail doesn't move? No, when you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added at head, so length increases.\n\nHere: after moving to (1,6) and eating, the new snake positions: head at (1,6), then the previous head (1,5) becomes body, and so on, up to the tail (5,1), but since we ate, we don't remove the tail, so new tail is still (5,1), but with an extra segment.\n\nPositions before move: [ (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] 9 segments.\n\nAfter moving up to (1,6) and eating: new positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] 10 segments. Tail is still (5,1) for now, but after next move, it will move.\n\nSince we ate, the tail doesn't advance on this turn; it stays, so we add a new head position.\n\nNow, after this, head is at (1,6), direction Up.\n\nBut (1,6) is at the top, y=6, and above is y=7 wall, so I cannot move up further.\n\nAlso, left is x=0 wall, cannot move left.\n\nDown to (1,5), but (1,5) is now occupied by the second segment, so moving down would be collision unless it's the tail, but it's not the tail; tail is (5,1).\n\nAfter this move, positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), etc.\n\nIf I move down to (1,5), which is occupied by the first body segment, so deadly collision.\n\nSo from (1,6), possible moves: only right to (2,6)? Or down? Down to (1,5) is body, not safe.\n\nRight to (2,6) might be possible.\n\n(2,6) is not occupied, I think.\n\nCurrent positions after eating: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nSo (2,6) is empty? (2,6) is x=2,y=6.\n\nNot listed, so should be free, unless wall, but no wall there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is occupied, (0,6) wall, (1,7) not exist, y=7 wall.\n\nSo from (1,6), only possible move is right to (2,6), because:\n\n- Up: y=7 wall, impossible\n\n- Down: (1,5) is body segment, deadly\n\n- Left: x=0 wall, impossible\n\n- Right: (2,6), which seems free.\n\nSo I have to move right to (2,6).\n\nThen from there, I can move down or right or up, but up is wall, so down or right.\n\nBut this seems risky because I'm cornering myself.\n\nMoreover, after moving to (2,6), the snake is long, and the area might be tight.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think about the food life span.\n\nAnother option: instead of moving up, I could move right to (2,5) now.\n\nFrom (1,5), move right to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is not occupied by body or wall, should be safe.\n\nThen from there, I have more options.\n\nBut (1,6) food has life span 3 at turn 26, so it disappears at turn 29, meaning I can eat it in turn 26,27,28.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, but after moving away, it might be hard to come back.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,1) and (6,6), but (1,1) is far, and (6,6) is also far.\n\nNow, tail is at (5,1), which is near (4,1), etc.\n\nAlso, special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (5,1), not adjacent to head. Head at (1,5), tail at (5,1), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,5) and (5,1) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = 4 + 0? x diff 4, y diff 4, manhattan distance 8, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nIf I move up to (1,6) and eat food, I get +1, but then I'm stuck at (1,6) and must move right to (2,6) next turn.\n\nThen from (2,6), where can I go?\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), head at (2,6), previous head (1,6) becomes body.\n\nSnake positions: assume I moved to (1,6) at turn 26, then to (2,6) at turn 27.\n\nAfter turn 26 move to (1,6) and eat, positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] length 10.\n\nThen at turn 27, I move right to (2,6), and since no food there, the tail moves, so we remove (5,1), and add head (2,6), so positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] and tail is (4,1)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (2,6): new head (2,6), previous segments: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — so 10 segments, tail at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) was there, and we didn't eat, so tail moves from (5,1) to... previous tail was (5,1), but after moving head to (2,6) without eating, we remove the tail (5,1), so positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]? No.\n\nThe positions are in order: before move: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] indices 0 to 9.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6), new head (2,6), then the first body is (1,6), then (1,5), ..., up to (4,1), and we remove the last one, (5,1), so new positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n\nBut (2,4) is at position 4, and (4,1) is last, but (4,1) is at y=1, x=4.\n\nNow head at (2,6), which is top row.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: y=7 wall, impossible\n\n- Down: to (2,5)\n\n- Left: to (1,6), but (1,6) is occupied by the first body segment, so deadly collision\n\n- Right: to (3,6)\n\n(2,5) is free? Current positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), ... (4,1)\n\n(2,5) is not in the list, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) not in list.\n\nSo from (2,6), I can move down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\nIf I move down to (2,5), then from there I can go further.\n\nBut let's see the food at (1,6) is eaten, so gone.\n\nOther food: (1,1) at (1,1), which is currently occupied by... in the positions, (4,1) and (5,1) are near, but (1,1) is free, I think.\n\nPositions: after turn 27, positions include (4,1) at tail, but (1,1) is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is free.\n\nBut I'm at (2,6), so to get to (1,1) or (6,6) is far.\n\nMoreover, (1,1) has life span 6, so until turn 31, and (6,6) until turn 34.\n\nBut if I go to (2,6), I might be able to go down or right.\n\nNow, alternative: at turn 26, instead of moving up, I move right to (2,5).\n\nFrom (1,5), move right to (2,5).\n\nThen positions after move: since no food at (2,5), I assume, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move: [ (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ]\n\nMove to (2,5), no food, so new head (2,5), then (1,5) becomes body, and remove tail (5,1), so positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n\nTail at (4,1).\n\nHead at (2,5), direction: since I moved right, new direction is Right.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right? But current direction Right, so cannot move Left instantly.\n\nPossible: Up to (2,6), Down to (2,4), Right to (3,5)\n\nLeft to (1,5) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nNow, (2,4) is occupied? Positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), ... so (2,4) is the fourth segment, not tail, so moving down to (2,4) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is body, cannot move left.\n\nSo safe moves: Up to (2,6) or Right to (3,5)\n\n(2,6) has no food, I think, only (1,6) has food, but (2,6) is empty.\n\nFood at (1,6), not (2,6).\n\nSo if I move up to (2,6), no food.\n\nOr right to (3,5).\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is available, and (1,6) food is still there, so I could move to (1,6) later, but from (2,6), I can move left to (1,6), but (1,6) might be free or not.\n\nLet's think about the food at (1,6) with short life span.\n\nAt turn 26, life span 3, so it will be gone after turn 28, meaning present on 26,27,28.\n\nTurn 26: I can eat it by moving up.\n\nIf I don't eat on 26, on turn 27 I could eat it if I move to it.\n\nBut from where?\n\nIf on turn 26 I move right to (2,5), then on turn 27 from (2,5) I can move up to (2,6), then on turn 28 from (2,6) I can move left to (1,6) to eat it, but on turn 28 it is still present? Life span 3 at turn 26: present on 26,27,28, gone on 29.\n\nSo on turn 28, it is there.\n\nBut when I move to (1,6) on turn 28, is it safe?\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, turn 26: move right to (2,5)\n\nPositions after: head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nDirection Right.\n\nTurn 27: from (2,5), I can move up to (2,6) or right to (3,5)\n\nSuppose I move up to (2,6) to be able to eat (1,6) next.\n\nMove to (2,6), no food, so tail moves: new head (2,6), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) and tail (4,1) removed, so positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] tail (4,2)? (4,2) is at index 8.\n\nList: indices: 0:(2,6), 1:(2,5), 2:(1,5), 3:(1,4), 4:(2,4), 5:(3,4), 6:(4,4), 7:(4,3), 8:(4,2)\n\nTail (4,2)\n\nHead at (2,6), direction Up (since moved up).\n\nTurn 28: from (2,6), I can move left to (1,6) or down to (2,5) or right to (3,6)\n\n(2,5) is occupied by body segment (index 1), so moving down to (2,5) would be collision, deadly.\n\nLeft to (1,6): (1,6) has food, and it's free? Positions: (1,6) not in the list, so yes, free.\n\nSo move left to (1,6), eat food.\n\nThen after eating, positions: new head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) and since eat, tail not removed, so length 10, positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nNow head at (1,6), same as before, stuck.\n\nFrom (1,6), only move is right to (2,6), but (2,6) is now the first body segment, so moving right to (2,6) would be collision! (2,6) is directly behind head.\n\nPositions: head (1,6), then (2,6), which is adjacent and behind.\n\nIf I move right to (2,6), that cell is occupied by the first body segment, so collision, deadly.\n\nAnd I cannot move up (wall), left (wall), down to (1,5) which is body.\n\n(1,5) is in positions, index 3, body segment.\n\nSo from (1,6) after eating on turn 28, I have no safe move! All directions blocked or deadly.\n\nThus, moving to (1,6) on turn 28 leads to death on the next move.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat it on turn 26 directly.\n\nIf I eat on turn 26, then on turn 27 I move to (2,6), and from there I can move down or right.\n\nFrom (2,6) after turn 27 move, positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] as before.\n\nHead at (2,6), I can move down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) should be free, as not in positions.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) free.\n\nIf I move down to (2,5), then from (2,5) I can go to other places.\n\nBut I need to consider the other food and long-term survival.\n\nThere is food at (1,1), which is near the tail area.\n\nCurrent tail after some moves.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,1), which might block paths.\n\nSince eating (1,6) on turn 26 is possible and doesn't immediately kill me, whereas delaying might cause issues, I should eat it now.\n\nMoreover, with the short life span, it might be risky to wait.\n\nAnother food at (1,1) with life span 6, so I can get it later.\n\n(6,6) with long life.\n\nBut after eating (1,6), I'm at top-left corner, and the snake body is mostly on the left and bottom, so I need to navigate carefully.\n\nLet's plan the moves after eating on turn 26.\n\nTurn 26: move Up to (1,6), eat food. Snake grows to 10 segments.\n\nPositions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ] head (1,6), direction Up.\n\nTurn 27: must move Right to (2,6), since only choice. No food at (2,6), so tail moves: new head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), etc., remove tail (5,1), so positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] tail (4,1)\n\nHead at (2,6), direction Right (since moved right).\n\nNow, from (2,6), I can move Down to (2,5) or Right to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is free, (3,6) free.\n\nI need to think about getting to other food.\n\nFood at (1,1) is at (1,1), which is near (4,1) but (4,1) is tail, but after moves, it might move.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) at top-right.\n\nSince I'm at (2,6), moving down to (2,5) might be better to go towards the center.\n\nMoving right to (3,6) towards (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) has long life, no hurry.\n\nAlso, (1,1) has life span 6, from turn 26 to 31, so I have time.\n\nBut to reach (1,1), I need to go down and left.\n\nCurrently, the body is on the left, so moving down might be safer.\n\nLet me see the grid.\n\nPositions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo the area around: (2,5) is free, (3,5) free, etc.\n\nIf I move down to (2,5), then head at (2,5), direction Down.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move down to (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied by body, index 4 in positions, not tail, so collision.\n\nMove left to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, index 2, collision.\n\nMove right to (3,5), which is free.\n\nSo only move right to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), etc.\n\nBut this is getting constrained.\n\nIf from (2,6) I move right to (3,6) instead.\n\nThen head to (3,6), no food, tail moves, positions: new head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) and remove (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move down to (3,5) or left to (2,6) or right to (4,6), etc.\n\n(2,6) is body, so cannot left.\n\nDown to (3,5) or right to (4,6) or up wall.\n\nSo (3,5) or (4,6).\n\nThen I can continue to (6,6) for example.\n\nBut (6,6) food is there.\n\nSince (1,6) is eaten, and I have to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at turn 26, instead of eating (1,6), I can ignore it and go for other food, but it's +1 and I can get it safely now, so better to eat it.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat it, it disappears, wasted.\n\nSo I think eating on turn 26 is best.\n\nThen for turn 27, I have to move right to (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 28, from (2,6), I should move down to (2,5) to avoid being stuck on top.\n\nIf I move down to (2,5), then as above, from (2,5) I can only move right to (3,5), since down and left are blocked.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5) on turn 28.\n\nTurn 27: at (2,6), move down to (2,5).\n\nNo food, tail moves: previous positions before move: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n\nMove head to (2,5), new head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) and remove tail (4,1), so positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nHead at (2,5), direction Down.\n\nNow from (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (2,6): but (2,6) is occupied by body segment (index 1), so collision\n\n- Down to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied by body (index 5), collision\n\n- Left to (1,5): (1,5) occupied by body (index 3), collision\n\n- Right to (3,5): free, as not in positions\n\nSo only move right to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 28: move to (3,5), no food, tail moves.\n\nPositions before: [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nMove to (3,5), new head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) and remove tail (4,2), so positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction Right.\n\nNow from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,6): free?\n\n- Down to (3,4): but (3,4) is body, index 7, collision\n\n- Left to (2,5): (2,5) is body, index 1, collision\n\n- Right to (4,5): free? Not in positions\n\nSo can move up to (3,6) or right to (4,5)\n\n(3,6) might be available.\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), then I can go towards (6,6).\n\nOr down, but down to (3,4) is blocked.\n\nRight to (4,5) might be towards center.\n\nNow, food at (1,1) is still there, but I'm moving away.\n\nTo get to (1,1), I need to go left and down, but the body is there, so it might be tight.\n\nSince the tail is moving, I can follow the tail or something.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nIn current positions, tail is (4,3), and (1,1) is free.\n\nBut there is internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) blocked.\n\nPath to (1,1) might be possible later.\n\nFor now, at (3,5), I should move to open space.\n\nPerhaps move right to (4,5) to go towards the right side.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or right.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,1).\n\nIt has life span 6, so at turn 26, present until turn 31.\n\nCurrent turn after 28, turn 29,30,31 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) until 34.\n\nBut I need to plan to eat (1,1) before it disappears.\n\nSince the snake is long, and the left side has body, I might need to clear some space.\n\nAnother option: after eating (1,6) on turn 26, and moving to (2,6) on 27, on turn 28 from (2,6), instead of moving down, I move right to (3,6).\n\nTurn 27: at (2,6), move right to (3,6).\n\nNo food, tail moves: positions before: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n\nMove to (3,6), new head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) remove tail (4,1), positions: [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nHead at (3,6), direction Right.\n\nTurn 28: from (3,6), move down to (3,5) or right to (4,6) or up wall, left to (2,6) body.\n\nSo down to (3,5) or right to (4,6).\n\nSay move down to (3,5), no food, tail moves: new head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) remove tail (4,2), positions: [ (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nThen from (3,5), as before, move up to (3,6) body, down to (3,4) body, left to (2,5)? (2,5) is free? Not in positions, so can move left to (2,5) or right to (4,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) is free, so move left to (2,5) or right to (4,5).\n\nIf I move left to (2,5), then I can go down to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, so from (2,5) down to (2,4) collision, left to (1,5) body, up to (2,6) body, only right to (3,5) which I came from, not good.\n\nSo better to move right to (4,5) from (3,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I'm not making progress towards (1,1).\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the (1,6) food at all, but that seems wasteful, and it's +1.\n\nBut let's consider the initial choice.\n\nAt turn 26, from (1,5), I can move right to (2,5) instead of up.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move up to (2,6) or right to (3,5).\n\nIf I move up to (2,6) on turn 27, then on turn 28 I can move left to (1,6) but as we saw, that leads to death.\n\nSo not good.\n\nFrom (2,5), move right to (3,5) on turn 27.\n\nTurn 26: move right to (2,5), no food, positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] tail (4,1)\n\nDirection Right.\n\nTurn 27: from (2,5), move right to (3,5), no food, tail moves: new head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) remove tail (4,1), positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction Right.\n\nTurn 28: from (3,5), move up to (3,6) or down to (3,4) or left to (2,5) body, right to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is body, index 5, collision.\n\n(2,5) body, index 1, collision.\n\nSo move up to (3,6) or right to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) has no food, (4,5) no.\n\nSay move right to (4,5), no food, tail moves: new head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) remove tail (4,2), positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move up to (4,6), down to (4,4), left to (3,5) body, right to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) is body, index 7, collision.\n\n(3,5) body, index 1, collision.\n\nSo move up to (4,6) or right to (5,5).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I missed the (1,6) food, which disappears after turn 28, so on turn 29 it's gone, so I lost it.\n\nWhereas if I ate it on turn 26, I got the point.\n\nSo for maximizing score, I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, for long-term, after eating, I can navigate down and right.\n\nLet's plan a path to (1,1).\n\nAfter eating (1,6) on turn 26, and moving to (2,6) on 27, on turn 28 from (2,6) move down to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 28, from (2,6) move down to (2,5), positions as before: [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] after move and tail move.\n\nEarlier: after move to (2,5) on turn 28, positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] head (2,5)\n\nThen on turn 29, from (2,5), only move right to (3,5), as other directions blocked.\n\nMove to (3,5), no food, tail moves: new head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) remove tail (4,2), positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nHead (3,5), direction Right.\n\nTurn 30: from (3,5), move down to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, collision; move up to (3,6) or right to (4,5) or left to (2,5) body.\n\nSo move up to (3,6) or right to (4,5).\n\nSay move right to (4,5), no food, tail moves: new head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) remove tail (4,3), positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nHead (4,5), direction Right.\n\nTurn 31: from (4,5), move down to (4,4) body, collision; move up to (4,6) or right to (5,5) or left to (3,5) body.\n\nSo move up to (4,6) or right to (5,5).\n\nBut food at (1,1) disappears after turn 31, so on turn 31 it is still present? Life span 6 at turn 26: present on turns 26,27,28,29,30,31, gone on 32.\n\nSo on turn 31, I can still eat it, but I'm at (4,5), far from (1,1), and the body is in the way, so I can't reach it in time.\n\nIf I had gone left earlier, but with the body, it's hard.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to go for (1,1) first or something.\n\nBut at turn 26, from (1,5), if I move right to (2,5), then on turn 27 I can move down or something to go towards (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,5), after turn 26 move, positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n\nHead (2,5), direction Right.\n\nTurn 27: from (2,5), I can move down to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, collision; move up to (2,6) or right to (3,5).\n\nMove up to (2,6), no food, tail moves: new head (2,6), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) remove tail (4,1), positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move left to (1,6) but on turn 27, (1,6) food is there, life span 3, so on turn 27 it is present.\n\nMove left to (1,6), eat food.\n\nBut then head at (1,6), and body is (2,6), (2,5), etc.\n\nPositions after eating: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] length 10.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can only move down to (1,5) but (1,5) is body, collision; or right to (2,6) body, collision; up wall, left wall. No move, death on next turn.\n\nSo same problem as before.\n\nIf from (2,6) I don't move to (1,6), but move down to (2,5) or right.\n\nBut then I miss the food.\n\nSo to avoid death, I should not eat (1,6) at all if I can't do it safely early.\n\nBut on turn 26, eating it is safe, and I can move to (2,6) next, then from there I have to move down or right, and I can survive.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) move down to (2,5), then to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc., and I can go to (6,6) later.\n\n(1,1) might be too risky to reach in time, so I might miss it, but it's only +1, and I have (6,6) with +1 and long life.\n\nSo for long-term survival, eating (1,6) on turn 26 is fine, and then I can head towards (6,6).\n\nLet's commit to that.\n\nTurn 26: move Up to (1,6) and eat.\n\nThen turn 27: move Right to (2,6)\n\nNow for turn 28, from (2,6), I should move Down to (2,5) to start descending.\n\nThen turn 29: from (2,5), move Right to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: from (3,5), I can move Right to (4,5) or Up to (3,6)\n\nSince I want to go to (6,6), moving up might be better.\n\nFrom (3,5), move Up to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 31: from (3,6), move Right to (4,6)\n\nTurn 32: from (4,6), move Right to (5,6)\n\nTurn 33: from (5,6), move Right to (6,6), eat food.\n\nBut need to check if (6,6) is still there; life span 9 at turn 26, present until turn 34, so on turn 33 it is there.\n\nAnd the path seems clear.\n\nBut let's verify the positions over time.\n\nFirst, turn 26: move Up to (1,6), eat. Snake positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ]\n\nTurn 27: move Right to (2,6), no food, so tail moves: remove (5,1), add head (2,6), so positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] tail (4,1)\n\nTurn 28: move Down to (2,5), no food, tail moves: remove (4,1), add head (2,5), positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] tail (4,2)\n\nTurn 29: move Right to (3,5), no food, tail moves: remove (4,2), add head (3,5), positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 30: move Up to (3,6), no food, tail moves: remove (4,3), add head (3,6), positions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 31: move Right to (4,6), no food, tail moves: remove (4,4), add head (4,6), positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ] tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 32: move Right to (5,6), no food, tail moves: remove (3,4), add head (5,6), positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 33: move Right to (6,6), and (6,6) has food, eat it. Snake grows: new positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] length 11.\n\nNow, head at (6,6), top-right corner.\n\nThen from there, I can move down or left, but (5,6) is body, so cannot down or left? Moves:\n\n- Up: wall\n\n- Down: to (6,5), but (6,5) may be free\n\n- Left: to (5,6), which is body segment, collision\n\n- Right: wall\n\nSo can only move down to (6,5), if free.\n\nIn positions, (6,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut this seems feasible.\n\nI missed (1,1) food, but it's only one point, and I got two points from (1,6) and (6,6).\n\n(1,1) disappeared at turn 32.\n\nBut in the plan, I survived and got two foods.\n\nIf I try to go for (1,1), it might be risky with the short time.\n\nSo I think this is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, for turn 26, move Up.\n\nThen for the next moves, as above.\n\nBut the question is to output actions for turn t1 and a few ahead, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to output multiple turns.\n\nAnswer format: for turn t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point.\n\nt1=26.\n\nSo for turn 26: U\n\nThen turn 27: R (to (2,6))\n\nTurn 28: D (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 29: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 30: U (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 31: R (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 32: R (to (5,6))\n\nTurn 33: R (to (6,6) and eat)\n\nBut I need to output only for a few turns, probably 5 or so.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format doesn't specify how many, but to demonstrate, I can output 5 turns: 26 to 30 or 31.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI could adjust to include the move to (1,6) and then down.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 28, from (2,6), I could move right to (3,6) instead of down, but then I'm still on top, and need to come down later.\n\nMoving down to (2,5) gets me to lower row earlier.\n\nIn the above, I moved down on turn 28.\n\nIn turn 30 I moved up to (3,6), which is fine.\n\nTo make it smoother, but it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: R\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nAnd so on, but since the format might expect only the immediate actions, but it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\", so I should provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: 26 to 30.\n\nBut turn 30 is U to (3,6), then to (4,6), etc.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 26):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (1,5), body segments: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)] (length 9).\n- **Head Direction**: Up (U).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 28).\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 31).\n  - (6,6): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 34).\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (3,1).\n- **Constraints**: Cannot reverse direction instantly (from U, cannot move D).\n\n**Immediate Decision (Turn 26):**\n- Possible moves from (1,5):\n  - U: To (1,6), which has food (+1, length increases). Safe if followed by a viable escape.\n  - R: To (2,5), no food, but opens more options.\n  - D: To (1,4) – body collision (deadly).\n  - L: To (0,5) – wall collision (deadly).\n- **Why eat (1,6) now?**:\n  - (1,6) has short life span (only available until turn 28). Eating it on turn 26 secures +1 and avoids missing it.\n  - Delaying risks trapping the snake (e.g., moving to (1,6) on turn 28 causes immediate death, as all exits are blocked by body segments).\n  - After eating, moving right on turn 27 avoids the top-left corner trap.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating (1,6) and (6,6) while ensuring survival. (1,1) is risky to reach by turn 31 due to body obstruction and distance; prioritizing (6,6) is safer with its longer life span.\n- **Key Risks**:\n  - After eating (1,6), the snake is at (1,6) with limited moves. Must move right on turn 27 to (2,6).\n  - From (2,6), moving down on turn 28 to (2,5) avoids top-row constraints and starts navigation toward (6,6).\n  - Path to (6,6): After (2,5), move right to (3,5) (turn 29), then up to (3,6) (turn 30) to align with top row, then right to (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6) by turn 33.\n  - Survival: This path avoids body collisions and walls, with ample space for movement after turn 30.\n- **Why not (1,1)?**:\n  - Distance: From turn 26 position, reaching (1,1) requires 5+ moves through body-congested area.\n  - Time: Must be eaten by turn 31, but the planned path moves away from (1,1). Attempting it risks dead ends or collision.\n  - Trade-off: Securing (1,6) and (6,6) yields +2; (1,1) is only +1 and not worth the high risk.\n\n**Planned Moves (Turns 26-30):**\n1. **Turn 26 (t1)**: Move U to (1,6) – eat food (+1), snake length to 10.\n2. **Turn 27**: Move R to (2,6) – no food, tail moves; avoids corner trap.\n3. **Turn 28**: Move D to (2,5) – no food, tail moves; descends for flexibility.\n4. **Turn 29**: Move R to (3,5) – no food, tail moves; progresses right.\n5. **Turn 30**: Move U to (3,6) – no food, tail moves; aligns for (6,6) path.\n\n**Beyond Turn 30**:\n- Turn 31: Move R to (4,6) (no food).\n- Turn 32: Move R to (5,6) (no food).\n- Turn 33: Move R to (6,6) – eat food (+1).\n\nThis plan scores +2 by turn 33 with minimal risk. After turn 30, the snake has open space for further navigation.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: R \\\\\nTurn 28: D \\\\\nTurn 29: R \\\\\nTurn 30: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 27. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to those cells. Also, (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,6), then body segments: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). Snake length is 10 segments.\n\nHead direction is Up, which is U. So currently moving upwards.\n\nFood: there are two food items.\n\n- First food at (1,1) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 27, life span is 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 31? Let's calculate: life span is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at turn t, with life span N, it will disappear after N turns from now. For example, if N=5 at turn 27, it decreases to 4 at turn 28, to 3 at 29, to 2 at 30, to 1 at 31, and disappears at turn 32? Or at the end of turn 31?\n\nTypically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N moves or after N full turns. But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, countdown is N, then at turn t+1, it's N-1, and so on, until turn t + N - 1 it has countdown 1, and after that turn, it disappears? I think it's better to think that when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nThe problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is life_span, say 5. After turn t, it decreases to 4. So at the start of turn t, countdown is 5, after the turn, it becomes 4. Similarly, after turn t+1, it becomes 3, and so on, until after turn t+4, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it exists during turns t to t+4, and disappears before turn t+5.\n\nFor food at (1,1): at turn 27, life_span=5, so it exists during turns 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and disappears before turn 32. So it can be eaten from turn 27 to 31 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, second food at (6,6) with value 1 and life_span=8. At turn 27, life_span=8, so it exists until turn 34 inclusive (turns 27 to 34, 8 turns: 27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34).\n\nBoth foods have value 1, so both are positive food, since value is +1.\n\nNow, I need to plan the next moves, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and ensure survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so accessible cells are from (1,1) to (6,6)? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls and cannot be moved to. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSo snake head at (1,6). Moving Up, which is increasing y? Let's confirm coordinates. Typically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up, I assume. So (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), so moving up increases y, meaning higher y is up. But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1).\n\nSo let's list the body: from head to tail: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). Tail is at (5,1).\n\nCurrent direction is U, so last move was up to (1,6) from (1,5)? Positions: head at (1,6), which was moved to from (1,5) by going up. So previous position was (1,5), and it moved U to (1,6). But head direction is given as U, meaning the snake is facing up.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,6): since head direction is U, but I can choose any direction except the opposite, which is D, down. Reverse of U is D, so I cannot move down immediately. But I can move U, L, or R.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,6)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (1,7) - but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- D: (1,5) - but this is the body segment, and it's not the tail? (1,5) is the second segment of the snake. Since the snake will move, if I go to (1,5), which is currently occupied, but after the move, the tail might move, so I need to see if it's safe.\n\nCollision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (1,5), which is the position of the second segment. After the move, the head would be at (1,5), and the body segments: the old head (1,6) becomes part of body, so the new body includes (1,6), and (1,5) is still there? Let's think how snake moves.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail is removed if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nIn this move, if I move to a cell, that becomes new head, and the previous head becomes neck, and so on, and the tail cell is vacated unless food eaten.\n\nSpecifically, when moving:\n\n- If no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n\n- If food eaten, head moves to food position, snake grows, so tail remains.\n\nNow, for collision: the head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, except the tail segment, because the tail will move away.\n\nMore precisely: after the move, if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the current tail, it collides. But since the tail moves if no food eaten, it might be safe to move to the tail position.\n\nIn this case, from (1,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,7) - y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- D: (1,5) - now, (1,5) is currently occupied by the second segment. After moving down to (1,5), the new head is at (1,5), and the body segments will be: (1,6) (old head), then (1,4), (2,4), etc. down to tail (5,1). Since no food eaten, the tail (5,1) is removed, so the new snake positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and (5,1) is gone? Let's list:\n\nCurrent snake: positions in order: index 0: head (1,6), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,1), 9: tail (5,1)\n\nIf I move down to (1,5), new head is (1,5), and the body: segment 0 (old head) moves to where? When head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new positions:\n\n- New head: (1,5)  // moved down\n\n- Then segment 1 (old head) becomes new segment 1: (1,6)  // since head was at (1,6), now it's part of body\n\n- Segment 2: (1,4)  // previous segment 1 position\n\n- Segment 3: (2,4)  // previous segment 2\n\n- Segment 4: (3,4)  // previous segment 3\n\n- Segment 5: (4,4)  // previous segment 4\n\n- Segment 6: (4,3)  // previous segment 5\n\n- Segment 7: (4,2)  // previous segment 6\n\n- Segment 8: (4,1)  // previous segment 7\n\n- Segment 9: (5,1)  // previous segment 8, but since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so we don't add a new segment. The snake shortens? No, when no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so the snake has one less segment? No.\n\nStandard snake: when moving without eating, the head moves forward to a new cell, and the tail is removed from its current position, so the snake effectively moves one cell forward, length unchanged.\n\nIn terms of positions: new head at new position, then the positions from old head to the segment before tail are kept, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (1,5):\n\n- New head: (1,5)\n\n- New segment 1: (1,6)  // old head\n\n- New segment 2: (1,4)  // old segment 2? Old segments: after head move, the body segments shift.\n\nBetter to think: the snake body from head to tail.\n\nAfter move: the new head is at the new position, and the previous head position becomes the new segment 1, previous segment 1 position becomes new segment 2, and so on, up to the previous segment before tail. The previous tail position is abandoned.\n\nIn this case, current segments: 0: (1,6), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (2,4), ..., 8: (4,1), 9: (5,1)\n\nAfter moving down to (1,5): new head is at (1,5), which was old segment 1 position.\n\nThen new segment 1 is at old head position: (1,6)\n\nNew segment 2 is at old segment 2 position: (1,4)\n\nNew segment 3 is at old segment 3 position: (2,4)\n\n...\n\nNew segment 8 is at old segment 8 position: (4,1)\n\nAnd old segment 9 (tail) at (5,1) is removed, so no new segment 9. Snake now has 9 segments? Length decreases? But only if no food eaten, length should stay the same.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: the snake has a head and body segments. When it moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the new cell has no food, the head occupies the new cell, and the tail cell is vacated (removed), so the snake moves forward, length unchanged.\n\n- If the new cell has food, the head occupies the food cell, food is eaten, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment, length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions, for no food: new head position is the new cell, and the body positions are the previous head position, and then the previous body positions except the tail is omitted.\n\nFor example, current positions: [H, B1, B2, B3, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to new cell N (no food): new positions [N, H, B1, B2, B3, ...] but up to the second last body segment, and T is removed.\n\nSince T was the last, it's not included.\n\nIn this case, positions: H=(1,6), B1=(1,5), B2=(1,4), B3=(2,4), B4=(3,4), B5=(4,4), B6=(4,3), B7=(4,2), B8=(4,1), T=(5,1)\n\nIf move to (1,5) which is B1, no food there.\n\nNew head: (1,5)\n\nNew B1: old H = (1,6)\n\nNew B2: old B1 = (1,5) but (1,5) is now head, so new B2 is old B2 = (1,4)\n\nNew B3: old B3 = (2,4)\n\nNew B4: old B4 = (3,4)\n\nNew B5: old B5 = (4,4)\n\nNew B6: old B6 = (4,3)\n\nNew B7: old B7 = (4,2)\n\nNew B8: old B8 = (4,1)\n\nAnd old T (5,1) is removed, so no new T for that, but new tail is new B8 at (4,1)\n\nSo new snake: head (1,5), then (1,6), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  -- 9 segments, but it should be 10? Length decreased? That can't be right.\n\nI think I'm missing something. When the head moves to a new position, the body follows, so the segment that was at B1 moves to the head position, B2 to B1 position, and so on, down to T moving to the position of the previous segment before it.\n\nLet's think differently: the snake is a sequence of cells. When it moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the sequence.\n\nFor move to cell C:\n\n- New position 0: C\n\n- New position 1: old position 0\n\n- New position 2: old position 1\n\n- ...\n- New position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to len-1\n\nBut the last position, old position len-1, is vacated.\n\nSo for a snake of length L, positions p0, p1, p2, ..., p{L-1}\n\nAfter move to C, new positions: C, p0, p1, p2, ..., p{L-2}  -- so the new positions are C, then the old positions from 0 to L-2, and old p{L-1} is removed.\n\nThe new length is L if no food, or L+1 if food eaten.\n\nIn this case, L=10, positions p0=(1,6), p1=(1,5), p2=(1,4), p3=(2,4), p4=(3,4), p5=(4,4), p6=(4,3), p7=(4,2), p8=(4,1), p9=(5,1)\n\nIf move to C = (1,5), which is currently p1.\n\nAfter move, new head: C = (1,5)\n\nNew p1: old p0 = (1,6)\n\nNew p2: old p1 = (1,5) but (1,5) is now head, so new p2 is old p1 position, but old p1 is (1,5), which is occupied, but in the new position, new p2 should be old p1, but old p1 is the cell, not the position.\n\nPositions: new p0 = C = (1,5)\n\nnew p1 = old p0 = (1,6)\n\nnew p2 = old p1 = (1,5)  but (1,5) is the same as new p0, so conflict? That can't be.\n\nI see the problem. When moving to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it can be problematic.\n\nIn this case, (1,5) is currently occupied by p1. If I move the head to (1,5), after the move, the new head is at (1,5), and new p1 is at old p0 (1,6), and new p2 is at old p1 (1,5), but (1,5) is now the head position, so new p2 would be at (1,5), which is the same as head, so the head and p2 are at the same cell, which is a collision.\n\nYes, that's why it's dangerous to move to a body segment that is not the tail.\n\nSpecifically, if you move to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, then after the move, that body segment will be at a new position, but the new position for that index might be different.\n\nIn this case, moving to (1,5), which is p1. After move, new p0 = (1,5), new p1 = (1,6), new p2 = old p1 = (1,5), so new p2 is at (1,5), which is the same as new p0, so head and body segment at same cell, collision.\n\nIf I move to the tail position, and it's not eaten, then it might be safe.\n\nFor example, if I move to the tail position, say (5,1), which is currently p9.\n\nThen new head at (5,1), new p1 at (1,6), new p2 at (1,5), ..., new p9 at old p8 = (4,1), and old p9 is vacated. Since new head is at old p9, and new p1 is at old p0, etc, no conflict because the tail moved away.\n\nSo, in general, it is safe to move to the current tail position, because the tail will move, so after move, that cell is only head.\n\nBut for other body segments, it's not safe.\n\nAlso, for the food under body, it's only edible if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nBack to possible moves from (1,6):\n\n- U: (1,7) - wall, invalid\n\n- D: (1,5) - currently body segment p1, not tail, so if I move there, after move, new p2 would be at (1,5) same as head, collision. So invalid.\n\n- L: (0,6) - x=0 is wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,6) - now, what is at (2,6)? From the positions, (2,6) is not occupied by snake or wall? Walls are at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,6) is within bounds, and not in snake positions? Snake positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). So (2,6) is empty, no wall, so valid move.\n\nR to (2,6) is possible.\n\nAlso, since head direction is U, but I can move R, which is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nOpposite of U is D, which we already saw invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,6)? But what about other directions? U and L are walls, D is body, so only R is valid? That can't be right, or is it?\n\nLet's list all adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (1,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (1,5) - occupied by body, not tail, so collision if moved to, invalid\n\n- Left: (0,6) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,6) - free, as per positions, no snake there.\n\nBut is (2,6) free? Let's confirm snake positions: all positions are listed, (2,6) not among them, and not wall, so yes.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,1), not near here.\n\nSo from (1,6), only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nBut that seems limiting. Perhaps I can move in other ways, but according to this, only right is possible.\n\nBut let's double-check the positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\nSo (1,5) is directly below head, occupied.\n\n(1,7) up is wall.\n\n(0,6) left wall.\n\n(2,6) right is free.\n\nAlso, diagonals not allowed, only orthogonal.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nThen, after moving R, head direction changes to R.\n\nNow, food: there is food at (1,1) and (6,6).\n\n(1,1) is currently occupied? Snake has (4,1) and (5,1), so (1,1) is free? Positions: (4,1) and (5,1) are snake, but (1,1) is not listed, so it should be free, with food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is free with food.\n\nBut (1,1) has food, but it's under the snake? No, snake positions include (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but not (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are free? (1,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\n(1,1) is at the bottom-left, with food.\n\nBut there's an internal obstacle at (3,1), which is wall.\n\nNow, life span: food at (1,1) life 5, so must be eaten by turn 31.\n\nFood at (6,6) life 8, by turn 34.\n\nSince only one move possible at turn 27, I have to move R to (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 28, I need to plan.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 27, only choice is R.\n\nSo action for turn 27: R\n\nThen new head position: (2,6)\n\nHead direction now R.\n\nSnake new positions: after moving to (2,6), no food there, so snake grows? No, (2,6) has no food, so no growth.\n\nFood positions: (1,1) and (6,6), not (2,6).\n\nSo move to (2,6), no food eaten.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,6), then old head (1,6) becomes segment, then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail (5,1) is removed? Old positions: p0=(1,6), p1=(1,5), p2=(1,4), p3=(2,4), p4=(3,4), p5=(4,4), p6=(4,3), p7=(4,2), p8=(4,1), p9=(5,1)\n\nAfter move to (2,6):\n\nNew p0: (2,6)\n\nNew p1: old p0 = (1,6)\n\nNew p2: old p1 = (1,5)\n\nNew p3: old p2 = (1,4)\n\nNew p4: old p3 = (2,4)\n\nNew p5: old p4 = (3,4)\n\nNew p6: old p5 = (4,4)\n\nNew p7: old p6 = (4,3)\n\nNew p8: old p7 = (4,2)\n\nNew p9: old p8 = (4,1)  // since no food, old p9 is removed, so new tail is new p9 at (4,1)\n\nOld p9 was (5,1), removed.\n\nSo new snake: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  -- length still 10? Positions: 10 segments: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nHead direction now R, since moved right.\n\nNow turn 28, head at (2,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,6), can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite of R).\n\n- U: (2,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (2,5) - is this free? Current positions: (2,6) head, (1,6), (1,5), etc. (2,5) not in positions, so free? Let's see: (2,5) not listed, no wall, so free.\n\n- R: (3,6) - free? (3,6) not in positions, no wall, should be free.\n\n- L: (1,6) - but (1,6) is now the first body segment, new p1. If I move L to (1,6), which is currently occupied by new p1.\n\nIf I move to (1,6), new head at (1,6), but (1,6) is current body position.\n\nAfter move, new p0 = (1,6)\n\nNew p1 = old p0 = (2,6)\n\nNew p2 = old p1 = (1,6)  // old p1 is (1,6), so new p2 at (1,6), same as new p0, collision.\n\nSo moving to (1,6) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,5) or R to (3,6) should be fine.\n\nAlso, U invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6)\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to eat food.\n\nFood at (1,1) and (6,6).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, (6,6) top-right.\n\nSnake is at (2,6), which is top row, but y=6, since y=7 wall, so y=6 is second from top.\n\ny from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are accessible, similarly x=1 to 6.\n\nx and y from 1 to 6? x=0,7 walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\n(1,1) to (6,6).\n\nHead at (2,6).\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, internal wall at (3,1).\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (1,1). It has life span 5 at turn 27, so it disappears after turn 31, meaning it can be eaten on turn 31 at latest.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 8, disappears after turn 34.\n\nSince I have to plan 5+ turns, from turn 27 to, say, 32.\n\nAt turn 27, I must move R to (2,6).\n\nThen at turn 28, I can move D or R.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, from (2,5), I can go to (2,4), but (2,4) is currently a body segment? In new positions, (2,4) is new p4? New snake: positions (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo (2,4) is occupied.\n\nBut later it might move.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (1,1), I need to go to (1,6) or something, but (1,6) is now body.\n\nLet's simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, since (1,1) is time-sensitive, with only 5 turns left (from turn 27), and it takes multiple moves to reach.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (1,1): the Manhattan distance is |2-1| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6 moves, so I need at least 6 moves to reach it, but since it can be eaten on turn 31, and now turn 28, from turn 28 to 31 is 4 turns, so I can make 4 moves by turn 31, but I need 6 moves, so I cannot reach (1,1) by turn 31.\n\nTurn 27: at (1,6), move to (2,6)\n\nTurn 28: at (2,6), can move to (2,5) or (3,6)\n\nIf move to (2,5), then at turn 29, from (2,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,1) from (2,6): the shortest path is down to y=1, then left to x=1.\n\nFor example: from (2,6) to (2,5), (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied now.\n\nAt turn 28, after move to (2,6), positions include (2,4) at p4.\n\nBut as snake moves, positions change.\n\nSuppose at turn 28, I move D to (2,5).\n\nThen new head at (2,5), no food, so new positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) and tail (4,1) removed? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (2,5) at turn 28:\n\nNew p0: (2,5)\n\nNew p1: old p0 = (2,6)\n\nNew p2: old p1 = (1,6)\n\nNew p3: old p2 = (1,5)\n\nNew p4: old p3 = (1,4)\n\nNew p5: old p4 = (2,4)\n\nNew p6: old p5 = (3,4)\n\nNew p7: old p6 = (4,4)\n\nNew p8: old p7 = (4,3)\n\nNew p9: old p8 = (4,2)  // tail at (4,2)\n\nOld p9 (4,1) removed.\n\nSnake now: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNow turn 29, from (2,5), can move U, D, L, R? Direction is D, so opposite is U, cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (2,6) - but (2,6) is now body segment p1. If move to (2,6), new head at (2,6), new p1 at old p0 (2,5), new p2 at old p1 (2,6), same as head, collision. Invalid.\n\n- D: (2,4) - (2,4) is currently p5? Positions: p0=(2,5), p1=(2,6), p2=(1,6), p3=(1,5), p4=(1,4), p5=(2,4), p6=(3,4), p7=(4,4), p8=(4,3), p9=(4,2)\n\n(2,4) is p5, not tail, so if move to (2,4), new head at (2,4), new p1 at (2,5), new p2 at (2,6), ..., new p6 at old p5 = (2,4), same as head, collision. Invalid.\n\n- L: (1,5) - (1,5) is currently p3? p3 is (1,5), not tail. If move to (1,5), new head at (1,5), new p1 at (2,5), new p2 at (2,6), new p3 at (1,6), new p4 at (1,5)? old p3 is (1,5), so new p4 at (1,5), same as head, collision. Invalid.\n\n- R: (3,5) - free? (3,5) not in positions, no wall, so free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 28 I had moved R to (3,6) instead.\n\nAt turn 28, from (2,6), option to move R to (3,6).\n\nThen new head at (3,6), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail at (4,2) or (4,1)? After previous move to (2,6) at turn 27, positions were (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nMove to (3,6): new p0 (3,6), new p1 (2,6), new p2 (1,6), new p3 (1,5), new p4 (1,4), new p5 (2,4), new p6 (3,4), new p7 (4,4), new p8 (4,3), new p9 (4,2)  // tail at (4,2), (4,1) removed.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,6), can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU: (3,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (3,5) free? (3,5) not occupied, yes\n\nR: (4,6) free\n\nL: (2,6) is p1, not tail, move to (2,6) would cause collision, invalid.\n\nSo can move D to (3,5) or R to (4,6)\n\nBut back to the food at (1,1), it seems I can't reach it in time because from turn 27 at (1,6), to (1,1) is at least 5 moves down and left, but with obstacles and body, it might take more.\n\nFrom (1,6) to (1,1): need to go down 5 steps, but (1,5) is occupied initially, so I need to go around.\n\nShortest path: for example, right to (2,6), then down to (2,5), (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, etc.\n\nBut from above, at turn 28, if I go to (2,5), then at turn 29 only to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go down to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, or left to (2,5) but occupied, etc.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nSince (1,1) requires at least 6 moves from (1,6), and I have only 4 moves from turn 28 to turn 31 (turns 28,29,30,31), I can make 4 moves, but need 6, so impossible to reach by turn 31. Turn 31 is the last chance to eat, but I start from turn 27 at (1,6), after move to (2,6) at turn 27 end.\n\nAt start of turn 27, head at (1,6), after move, at turn 28 start, head at (2,6).\n\nThen from turn 28 to turn 31, I can move on turns 28,29,30,31, four moves.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (1,1): min Manhattan distance |2-1| + |6-1| =1+5=6, so at least 6 moves required, but I have only 4, so I cannot reach (1,1) before it disappears. Thus, I should forget about (1,1) and focus on the other food or survival.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) has more time, life span 8, from turn 27 to turn 34, so 8 turns to eat it.\n\nFrom current position at turn 27, (1,6), to (6,6), distance |1-6| + |6-6| =5+0=5, so 5 moves, possible.\n\nBut after turn 27 move to (2,6), at (2,6), to (6,6) is |2-6| +0 =4 moves.\n\nAnd I have until turn 34, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nBut first, at turn 27, I must move R to (2,6).\n\nThen at turn 28, I can choose to move D or R from (2,6).\n\nIf I want to go to (6,6), moving R is better, to (3,6).\n\nThen from there, I can keep moving right.\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nAt turn 28, from (2,6), if I move R to (3,6), as above.\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,6), can move D to (3,5) or R to (4,6), since U wall, L invalid.\n\n(4,6) is free? Not in positions, yes.\n\nIf I move R to (4,6), then new head (4,6), etc.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move R to (5,6), then to (6,6).\n\n(5,6) and (6,6) should be free.\n\n(6,6) has food.\n\nSo let's plan to eat (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,6) at turn 28, move R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 29: from (3,6), move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 30: from (4,6), move R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 31: from (5,6), move R to (6,6), eat food, snake grows.\n\nBut need to check if the path is clear.\n\nAt turn 27: after move, head at (2,6), snake: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nTurn 28: move R to (3,6), no food. New head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // (4,1) removed, tail at (4,2)\n\nTurn 29: move R to (4,6), no food. New head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)  // (4,2) removed? Old tail was (4,2), removed, new tail (4,3)\n\nPositions: new p0 (4,6), p1 (3,6), p2 (2,6), p3 (1,6), p4 (1,5), p5 (1,4), p6 (2,4), p7 (3,4), p8 (4,4), p9 (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 30: from (4,6), head direction R, move R to (5,6), no food. New head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  // tail (4,3) removed\n\nTurn 31: from (5,6), move R to (6,6), which has food, so eat it. Snake grows, so new head at (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and tail stays, so length 11.\n\nNow, after eating, the food is consumed, score +1.\n\nBut I need to think about survival after that.\n\nAt turn 28, if I had moved D instead to (2,5), then I might not reach (6,6) easily.\n\nBut since (1,1) is unreachable, going to (6,6) is a good target.\n\nIn the above plan, I reach (6,6) at turn 31.\n\nBut at turn 27, I move R.\n\nThen for turn 28, I need to specify the action.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 28, move R to (3,6)\n\nBut at turn 28, from (2,6), I could move D to (2,5), but that might lead to dead end or risk.\n\nFor example, if at turn 28 move D to (2,5), then as before, at turn 29 only move R to (3,5), then from (3,5), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nDirection after moving D is D, so cannot move U.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) - may be free or not, depending on previous.\n\nIn the scenario where I moved to (2,5) at turn 28, then to (3,5) at turn 29.\n\nAt turn 29 head at (3,5), body: from earlier, after turn 28 to (2,5): positions (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nThen turn 29 move R to (3,5), new head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)  // tail (4,2) removed\n\nNow at (3,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 30, from (3,5), can move D to (3,4), but (3,4) is body segment p7? Positions: p0=(3,5), p1=(2,5), p2=(2,6), p3=(1,6), p4=(1,5), p5=(1,4), p6=(2,4), p7=(3,4), p8=(4,4), p9=(4,3)\n\n(3,4) is p7, not tail.\n\nIf move D to (3,4), new head (3,4), new p1 (3,5), ..., new p8 (old p7) = (3,4), same as head, collision. Invalid.\n\nMove L to (2,5), but (2,5) is p1, not tail, collision if move there.\n\nMove U to (3,6), free? (3,6) not occupied, yes.\n\nMove R to (4,5), free? (4,5) not occupied, yes.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nBut to reach (6,6), it might take more moves.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (6,6): |3-6| + |5-6| =3+1=4 moves, min.\n\nBut with body, it might be ok.\n\nBut compared to the first plan, going directly right to (6,6) is faster and safer.\n\nIn the first plan, I can eat (6,6) by turn 31.\n\nNow, after that, I need to survive and perhaps eat other food, but no other food now, only (1,1) which will disappear soon.\n\n(1,1) disappears after turn 31, so at turn 32 it's gone.\n\nBut I might be able to eat it if I go earlier, but I can't, as established.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the tail or something.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,1) is at (1,1), which is near the tail.\n\nBut since I can't reach it in time, not worth.\n\nAlso, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (1,1), and tail is at (4,1) or moving, not adjacent now.\n\nAt turn 27, tail at (5,1), not adjacent to head.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nSo at turn 27: move R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 28: move R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 29: move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 30: move R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 31: move R to (6,6) and eat food.\n\nThen for turn 32, I need to move away.\n\nAfter eating at (6,6) on turn 31, new head at (6,6), body includes (5,6), (4,6), etc., and since grown, tail is at (4,4) or something.\n\nAfter turn 31: head moved to (6,6), ate food, so new positions: head (6,6), then old head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  // and since food eaten, no removal, so tail is (4,4), but old tail was (4,4)? Let's see:\n\nBefore turn 31 move: at turn 30 end, positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  // tail (4,4)\n\nIn turn 30 positions: from earlier, after turn 30 move to (5,6), positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)\n\nThen turn 31 move to (6,6), eat food, so new head (6,6), and body: old head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and since food eaten, tail remains, so new positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  // 11 segments, tail at (4,4)\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nNow turn 32, from (6,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,7) wall invalid\n\n- D: (6,5) free? Not occupied, yes\n\n- L: (5,6) which is body segment, p1, not tail, so if move to (5,6), collision, invalid\n\n- R: (7,6) x=7 wall invalid\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,5)\n\nThen move D, head direction down.\n\nSimilarly, continue.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns from turn 27.\n\nTurn 27 to 31 is 5 turns: 27,28,29,30,31.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 27: R, turn 28: R, turn 29: R, turn 30: R, turn 31: R\n\nThen I can add turn 32 if needed, but the answer format should start from turn 27.\n\nNow, but at turn 31, when I move to (6,6), I eat the food, which is good.\n\nIs there any risk in this path? From (1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (6,6), all cells are free at the time, as per earlier simulation.\n\nAt turn 28, (3,6) is free, turn 29 (4,6) free, etc.\n\nAfter turn 31, I have to move down to (6,5), but that's for later.\n\nThe problem is to maximize score, and since only one food is reachable, this should be fine.\n\nBut there is food at (1,1) that I can't reach, so no loss.\n\nPerhaps I can try to eat (1,1) by going down earlier, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but it doesn't affect the path to (6,6).\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after eating, I need to avoid colliding.\n\nBut for now, the plan to turn 31 seems safe.\n\nAt turn 27, only one choice, R.\n\nThen at turn 28, from (2,6), I can move D or R.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), then I might not reach (6,6) by turn 31, and I might miss the food if not careful.\n\nFor example, at turn 28 move D to (2,5), then turn 29 move R to (3,5), then turn 30, from (3,5) I can move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf move to (3,6), then turn 31 move R to (4,6), but (6,6) still far.\n\n|4-6| + |6-6| =2, so from (4,6) at turn 31, I can go to (5,6) turn 32, (6,6) turn 33, which is before turn 34, so I can still eat it, but later.\n\nBut in the first plan, I eat at turn 31, which is fine.\n\nIf I go down, I might have more options, but since no other food, going directly to the food is better to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, moving down might bring me closer to walls or body.\n\nFor example, at (2,5), then (3,5), etc., the body is below, might block.\n\nBut in the right path, it's clear.\n\nSo I think moving right all the way is best.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: R\n\nTurn 29: R\n\nTurn 30: R\n\nTurn 31: R\n\nBut I need to specify for turns 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.\n\nTurn 31 is included.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead, this should be fine.\n\nAfter turn 31, I can add turn 32: D, for example, but not necessary.\n\nThe answer format should be from turn 27 onwards for a few turns.\n\nSince the state is at turn 27, I need to output actions starting from turn 27.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, confirm head direction: after each move, direction changes.\n\nBut I don't need to output direction, only actions.\n\nSo for turn 27: action R\n\nTurn 28: action R\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, in the food, both have value 1, so positive.\n\nAnd (1,1) will disappear, but I can't eat it.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 27):**\n- **Snake Head**: (1, 6), moving Up (U).\n- **Snake Body**: [(1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (length 10).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1, 1): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 31).\n  - (6, 6): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 34).\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3, 1).\n- **Constraints**: Only possible move at turn 27 is Right (R) to (2, 6) due to walls and body collisions (Up to wall, Down to body, Left to wall).\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- **Food at (1, 1) is unreachable by turn 31**: From (1, 6), Manhattan distance to (1, 1) is 5. After moving R to (2, 6) at turn 27, the distance remains 5 (|2-1| + |6-1| = 6 cells, but only 4 moves possible from turn 28 to 31 (turns 28, 29, 30, 31). Minimum 6 moves needed, so impossible to reach before expiration. Ignore this food.\n- **Food at (6, 6) is reachable and valuable**: Value +1, disappears after turn 34. From (2, 6) at turn 28, Manhattan distance is 4 (|2-6| + |6-6|). Can be reached in 4 moves (by turn 31) with a clear path. Eating it maximizes score and grows snake to length 11.\n- **Path to (6, 6) is safe**: Moving right from (2, 6) to (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 6) avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions based on current and projected snake positions.\n- **Long-term Survival**: After eating at (6, 6), move Down to (6, 5) at turn 32 to avoid walls and open space for maneuvering. This prioritizes survival over immediate rewards beyond turn 31.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No instant reverse moves (e.g., from R, cannot move L next).\n  - No body collisions during the path; all target cells are free when moved to.\n  - Tail Reward Danger not applicable, as head not adjacent to tail with food.\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 27 to 31):**\n- **Turn 27**: Move R to (2, 6) – only valid move.\n- **Turn 28**: Move R to (3, 6) – progresses toward (6, 6), avoids body.\n- **Turn 29**: Move R to (4, 6) – continues path, cell free.\n- **Turn 30**: Move R to (5, 6) – prepares for final move.\n- **Turn 31**: Move R to (6, 6) – eats food (+1 score, snake length 11).\n\n**Projection Beyond (for survival):**\n- Turn 32: Move D to (6, 5) to avoid wall and body, opening options for future moves.\n\n**Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: R (right)\nTurn 28: R (right)\nTurn 29: R (right)\nTurn 30: R (right)\nTurn 31: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 28,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 28, and I'm the snake. My goal is to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (2,6), and the body segments follow: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Since there are 10 positions, the snake is 10 units long.\n\nHead direction is right (R), so the snake is moving to the right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 4. Since life span decreases each turn, including current, at turn 28, it has 4 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 31? Let me calculate: life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current. So if life span is 4 at turn 28, it should disappear at turn 28 + 4 - 1? No, let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for food at (1,1) with life span 4 at turn 28:\n\n- Turn 28: life span 4\n\n- Turn 29: life span 3\n\n- Turn 30: life span 2\n\n- Turn 31: life span 1\n\n- Turn 32: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 31, I think. When the head moves onto it, it's eaten before the life span decrease. But the disappearance happens after the countdown reaches 0.\n\nTypically, in such games, food is available as long as life span > 0, and when head moves to it, it's eaten. After movement, life span decreases.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know when it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, other food:\n\n- (6,6) with value 1 and life span 7 at turn 28. So it will last until turn 28 + 7 - 1? Let's think:\n\n- Turn 28: life span 7\n\n- Turn 29: 6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 34: 1\n\n- Turn 35: 0, disappears. So available until turn 34.\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 10 at turn 28. Available until turn 37.\n\nAll food has value 1, so positive, no negative food mentioned here. Value is 1 for all, so +1 each.\n\nNow, I need to decide the next moves, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,6), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nCurrent direction R, so I can go U, D, R, but not L.\n\nNow, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,6)\n\nBody: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells:\n\n(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nFood at: (1,1), (6,6), (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is food, but is it occupied? Snake is at (4,1), (4,2), etc., not at (2,3), so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) might be under the snake? Let's see: snake has (4,1), which is at (4,1), not (1,1). (1,1) is food, and snake is at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but not at (1,1), so (1,1) is free.\n\n(6,6) free.\n\n(2,3) free.\n\nNow, head at (2,6), moving right.\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- Up (U): (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down (D): (2,5)\n\n- Left (L): (1,6) but that's the body segment? (1,6) is the first body segment after head. But since the tail will move, when head moves, the tail moves forward, so moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, but only if it's the tail.\n\nLet's read about collisions.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and after movement, the tail moves away, so it's safe, as long as it's only the tail.\n\nIn this case, from (2,6), if I go left to (1,6), (1,6) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (4,1).\n\nSnake positions: head (2,6), then body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — so (4,1) is the tail.\n\n(1,6) is the segment right after head, so if head moves to (1,6), but (1,6) is occupied by body, and since it's not the tail, it would cause collision because after movement, the head would be on (1,6), but that cell was body, and now it's head, but the body segment that was there moves to where the head was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, all body segments follow, so the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nSo, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nTherefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it causes collision only if that segment is not the tail and will not be vacated.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because after movement, that cell would have both head and body or something, but in reality, the body moves, so it's only a problem if the head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt current state, cells occupied: all snake positions.\n\nHead at (2,6).\n\nIf I move to a new position, say to cell X.\n\nIf cell X is not occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, then it's ok.\n\nIf cell X is occupied by a body segment that is the tail, and no food eaten, tail moves away, so head can be there.\n\nIf cell X is occupied by a non-tail body segment, then after movement, that body segment will move to where the head was, but since head is moving to X, and the body segment that was at X is moving to the previous position, it might cause overlap or something.\n\nActually, in the move:\n\n- Head moves to new cell\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by body segment S, then after the move, segment S will have moved to the old head position, and head is at the cell where S was.\n\nBut for that to be safe, the cell must be free or only the tail, because if S is not the tail, S moves away, so head can occupy that cell without collision.\n\nCollision happens only if after the move, the head is on the same cell as a body segment.\n\nSince all segments move, the only body segment that could be on the same cell as head after move is if head moved to a cell that was occupied by a segment that doesn't move away, but all segments move except when growing.\n\nWhen no food eaten: head moves to new cell, body segments shift, tail is removed.\n\nSo, after move, the cells occupied are: new head position, and the body segments from head+1 to tail-1 in new positions, but tail is gone.\n\nSpecifically: let positions be P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail).\n\nAfter move to new head position P0':\n\n- New head: P0'\n\n- New body: P0 (old head), P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}\n\n- Tail Pk is removed.\n\nSo the new positions are: [P0', P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}]\n\nTherefore, if P0' is equal to any of P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1} before the move, that would be a collision because after move, P0' is head, and P0, P1, etc. are body, so if P0' was one of P1 to P_{k-1}, it would be occupied by body.\n\nBut P0' should not be equal to any of the current body positions except possibly Pk (tail), because Pk is removed, so if P0' = Pk, then after move, head is at Pk, and Pk is gone, so no collision.\n\nIf P0' = Pk, then after move: head at Pk (which was tail), body: P0 (old head), P1, ..., P_{k-1}, and Pk is removed, so it's fine.\n\nIf P0' = P1 for example, then after move, head at P1, and body includes P0 (at old head, which is P1? No.\n\nBefore move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]\n\nMove head to P0'.\n\nThen new positions: [P0', P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}]\n\nNow, if P0' was equal to P1 (before move), then after move, the cell P1 has both the head (P0') and the body segment that moved to P1? No.\n\nThe body segments: after move, the first body segment is at P0 (old head position), then P1, P2, etc.\n\nSo if P0' = P1 (before move), then after move, the head is at P1 (now called P0'), and the first body segment is at P0 (which is different from P1, unless P0=P1, but positions are unique I assume).\n\nSince all positions are distinct, if P0' = P1, then after move, head is at the cell that was P1, and the body segment that was at P1 is now at... before move, P1 is occupied.\n\nAfter move, the cell that was P1 now has the head, and since the body segment moves to the previous position, the segment that was at P1 moves to where? In the new body, the position P1 is now occupied by the segment that was at P0? Let's index.\n\nOld positions: index 0: head at P0\n\nIndex 1: body at P1\n\nIndex 2: at P2\n\n...\n\nIndex k: tail at Pk\n\nAfter moving head to P0':\n\nNew head at P0'\n\nThen new body: segment 1 moves to old head P0\n\nSegment 2 moves to old P1\n\n...\n\nSegment k moves to old P_{k-1}\n\nBut since tail is not grown, segment k is removed, so the new body has segments from 1 to k-1: segment 1 at P0, segment 2 at P1, ..., segment k-1 at P_{k-2}, and segment k at P_{k-1} is not present because no growth.\n\nNew positions: [P0', P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-2}]? Let's see:\n\nThe new position list is:\n\n- Head: P0'\n\n- Body segment 1: at old head position P0\n\n- Body segment 2: at old position of segment 1, P1\n\n- Body segment 3: at old position of segment 2, P2\n\n- ...\n\n- Body segment k: at old position of segment k-1, P_{k-1}\n\nBut since no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed, so we don't have segment k.\n\nSo new positions: head at P0', then body at P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1} for segments 1 to k-1? No.\n\nThe body segments are renumbered.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Position 0 (new head): P0'\n\n- Position 1 (new body segment 1): at P0 (old head)\n\n- Position 2 (new body segment 2): at P1 (old body segment 1)\n\n- Position 3 (new body segment 3): at P2 (old body segment 2)\n\n- ...\n\n- Position k (new body segment k): at P_{k-1} (old body segment k-1)\n\nBut since no growth, we have only up to position k-1, so the new tail is at P_{k-1}, and Pk is gone.\n\nSo new positions: [P0', P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}]\n\nThe cells occupied are: P0', P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}\n\nFor collision: if P0' is equal to any of P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}, then head is on a body segment cell.\n\nP0' equal to P0: that would be if head doesn't move, but it must move, so impossible.\n\nP0' equal to P1: if head moves to where segment 1 was.\n\nThen after move, head at P1, and body segment 2 is at P1 (since new position 2 is at old P1), so head and body segment 2 are both at P1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if P0' = P2, then after move, head at P2, and body segment 3 is at P2 (new position 3 at old P2), collision.\n\nOnly if P0' = Pk (the tail), then after move, head at Pk, and body segments: new position 1 at P0, new position 2 at P1, ..., new position k at P_{k-1}, so head at Pk, which is not in the body positions since body is at P0 to P_{k-1}, so no collision.\n\nAlso, if P0' is not occupied, no problem.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nFrom head (2,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (2,5) — is this occupied? Current positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). (2,5) is not in the list, so free. But is it wall? x=2, y=5, not border or obstacle, so valid.\n\n- L: (1,6) — currently occupied by body segment. Which segment? Positions: index 0: (2,6) head, index 1: (1,6), which is body segment 1, not tail. Tail is (4,1). So if head moves to (1,6), which is P1, then after move, head at P1, and new body segment 2 at old P1 (which is same as new head position? Old P1 is (1,6), new head at (1,6), and new body segment 2 at old P1, which is (1,6), so both at (1,6), collision. Invalid.\n\n- R: (3,6) — is this occupied? Not in positions, and not wall, x=3,y=6, grid ok.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food locations: (1,1), (6,6), (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is close to the snake body.\n\nSnake body has (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), etc., so (2,3) is below (2,4), and it's food with life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (2,3) might be under the snake? Current positions: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), etc., not (2,3), so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is food, near the tail at (4,1), but tail is at (4,1), and (1,1) is different.\n\n(6,6) is far.\n\nLife span: (1,1) has life 4, so must be eaten by turn 31 or it disappears. Turn 28 now, so turns 28,29,30,31 it exists, disappears on turn 32.\n\nAt turn 28, life span 4; turn 29:3; turn30:2; turn31:1; turn32:0 gone. So can be eaten on turn 31.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life 7: turn28:7, t29:6, ..., t34:1, t35:0 gone.\n\n(2,3) life 10: t28:10, t29:9, ..., t37:1, t38:0 gone.\n\nNow, head at (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I go R to (3,6), then new head position (3,6). Then body shifts: new head (3,6), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — tail (4,1) is gone.\n\nLength still 10, no food eaten.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction after move would be R, so can't go L (left) to (2,6), which is now body.\n\nBut (2,6) is body, so going left to (2,6) would cause collision? From (3,6), to (2,6): (2,6) is currently occupied by the new body segment, which is old head position.\n\nAfter move to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), etc.\n\nSo if from (3,6) I go left to (2,6), which is occupied by body segment 1. After move, head to (2,6), but (2,6) is already occupied by body, so collision. Invalid. So from (3,6), I cannot go left to (2,6).\n\nOther directions: U to (3,7) wall invalid; D to (3,5); R to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\nIf I go D from (2,6) to (2,5), then new head (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — tail (4,1) gone.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6) which is now body, so if go U to (2,6), collision, invalid. D to (2,4) which is body? Current after move: positions head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), etc.\n\n(2,4) is body segment, say index 5 or something. If from (2,5) go D to (2,4), (2,4) is occupied by body segment (after the shift, (2,4) is a body segment). Specifically, after move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (1,6), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (1,4), seg5 (2,4), seg6 (3,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (4,2) — tail was (4,1) gone, so 9 segments? No, length was 10, head moved, no food, so new length 10? Positions: old: 10 positions, head moves to new, tail removed, so 10 positions: new head and 9 body segments? Old positions 10, after move: new head and body from old head to second last tail? Earlier: new positions [P0', P0, P1, P2, ..., P8] for k=9, but let's count.\n\nOld positions: 10 segments: P0 to P9.\n\nAfter move to P0' = (2,5), new positions: head (2,5), then body: old P0 = (2,6), old P1 = (1,6), old P2 = (1,5), old P3 = (1,4), old P4 = (2,4), old P5 = (3,4), old P6 = (4,4), old P7 = (4,3), old P8 = (4,2) — and old P9 = (4,1) gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — that's 10 positions? Head and 9 body, but head is separate, so 10 cells occupied.\n\nFrom (2,5), moves:\n\n- U to (2,6): (2,6) is occupied by body segment 1 ( (2,6) ), so if move to (2,6), which is body, collision invalid.\n\n- D to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied by body segment 5 ( (2,4) ), not tail, so collision invalid.\n\n- L to (1,5): (1,5) is occupied by body segment 3 ( (1,5) ), collision invalid.\n\n- R to (3,5): (3,5) not occupied, not wall, so valid.\n\nSo from (2,5), only possible move is R to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6), moves: U (3,7) wall invalid, D to (3,5), L to (2,6) body invalid, R to (4,6) valid.\n\nSo in both cases, I have limited options.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nI need to eat food to grow and score.\n\nFood at (2,3) is close, but snake is around that area.\n\nAlso, (1,1) has short life, need to eat it soon.\n\n(6,6) is far.\n\nCurrent head (2,6), if I go R to (3,6), then to (4,6), etc., but that might lead to dead end.\n\nIf I go D to (2,5), then must go R to (3,5), then from there.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, but borders walls, so playable from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but (1,1) is food, not wall. Walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are inside, but obstacle at (3,1), which is wall, so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSo available cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except (3,1) is wall.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom.\n\nFood at (1,1), (6,6), (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is at row 2, column 3, y=3.\n\nFrom head (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I go R to (3,6), then to (4,6), then from (4,6) I can go D to (4,5), or U invalid, L to (3,6) body, R to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) to (4,5): (4,5) is free? Current positions not occupied, but after moves.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (2,5), then must go R to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) body, R to (4,5), etc.\n\n(3,4) is body, so if go D to (3,4), collision.\n\nLet's think about eating (2,3) food.\n\n(2,3) is below (2,4), which is occupied by snake body.\n\nTo eat (2,3), I need to move the head to (2,3) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied, and (2,3) is food.\n\nIf I can move the snake so that the body moves away from (2,4), then head can go to (2,3).\n\nFor example, if I move the snake down or something.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (4,1), and there's food at (1,1), which has short life.\n\nIf I can eat (1,1) soon, but it's near the tail.\n\nBut to eat (1,1), head needs to go to (1,1).\n\nCurrently head at (2,6), far from (1,1).\n\nAlso, (1,1) might be under the snake? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but not (1,1), so free.\n\nBut the snake body is above it.\n\nMoreover, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo if head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, eating that food causes the tail to grow, so head and tail collide after eating.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,1), no food there, food at (1,1), not on tail.\n\nSo for (1,1), it's safe to eat as long as head is not adjacent when eating, but the danger is only if food is on the tail cell.\n\nHere, (1,1) is separate.\n\nBut to reach (1,1), I need to go down and left.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,3), I need to go down.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, option: go down to (2,5) at turn 28.\n\nThen, from (2,5), only move is right to (3,5) at turn 29.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) body, invalid, R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is body, so if go D to (3,4), it's occupied, collision.\n\nSo from (3,5), can go U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf go U to (3,6), which was the position if I had gone right initially, but let's see.\n\nIf at turn 28 go R to (3,6), then turn 29 from (3,6) can go D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n\nSimilar.\n\nLet's assume I go down first to (2,5) at t28.\n\nThen t29: go R to (3,5).\n\nNow at (3,5), positions: let's update snake.\n\nAfter t28: head to (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — tail (4,1) gone, so positions: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nFrom (3,5), at t29, go to (3,5)? Head is at (2,5) after t28, so for t29, from (2,5) to (3,5).\n\nAfter t29 move to (3,5): new head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — tail (4,2) gone? Old tail was (4,2), so removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nFrom (3,5), for t30, possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): (3,6) not occupied, valid\n\n- D to (3,4): (3,4) is body segment, occupied, collision invalid\n\n- L to (2,5): (2,5) is body segment, occupied, invalid\n\n- R to (4,5): (4,5) not occupied, valid\n\nSo can go U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nI want to go towards (2,3) food.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), so from (3,5), I need to go left and down, but left to (2,5) is body, not possible.\n\nSo from here, I can go to (3,6) or (4,5), both away from (2,3).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then from there I can go down to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body? After moving to (3,6), positions change.\n\nThis might not be efficient.\n\nPerhaps I should go right first to (3,6) at t28.\n\nThen t28: head to (3,6), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — tail (4,1) gone.\n\nPositions: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nt29 from (3,6): can go D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay go D to (3,5) at t29.\n\nAfter move: head (3,5), body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — tail (4,2) gone.\n\nNow from (3,5), t30: can go U to (3,6) body invalid, D to (3,4) body invalid, L to (2,5) which is free? (2,5) not occupied, so valid, or R to (4,5) valid.\n\n(2,5) is free, so can go L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) is closer to (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go down to (2,4), but (2,4) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5) at t30, positions: head (2,5), body: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail (4,3) gone.\n\nFrom (2,5), t31 moves: U to (2,6) body invalid, D to (2,4) body invalid, L to (1,5) body invalid, R to (3,5) body invalid. All directions invalid? U to (2,6): (2,6) is body, D to (2,4): body, L to (1,5): body, R to (3,5): body. All adjacent cells are body, so trapped, death.\n\nOh no! So if I go to (2,5) at some point, I might get stuck.\n\nIn the first path, when I went to (2,5) at t28, then to (3,5) at t29, from (3,5) I could go U or R, not to (2,5).\n\nBut if in the second path, I go to (3,5) at t29, then to (2,5) at t30, I get stuck at t31.\n\nSo going to (2,5) is dangerous if it becomes surrounded.\n\nIn the current state, from head (2,6), going D to (2,5) might lead to a dead end later.\n\nWhereas going R to (3,6) seems better.\n\nLet's go with R to (3,6) at t28.\n\nThen from (3,6), t29: I can go D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n\nIf I go R to (4,6), then to (5,6), etc., but that might not help with the food.\n\n(1,1) food has short life, only 4 turns left, so I need to eat it soon or it disappears.\n\nAt turn 28, life span 4, so it can be eaten on turn 28,29,30,31.\n\nIf I don't eat it by turn 31, it's gone.\n\nHead is at (2,6), (1,1) is at (1,1), so I need to move down and left.\n\nBut the snake body is blocking the way.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,1), I need to go to (1,2) or something, but (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are occupied.\n\nThe only way is to move the snake so that the body moves away from the left column.\n\nFor instance, if I move right, the body might shift, freeing up (1,4) etc.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nLet's calculate how many turns to reach (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,6) to (1,1): Manhattan distance |2-1| + |6-1| = 1+5=6, but with body in way, it might take more turns.\n\nWith only 4 turns left, it might be tight.\n\nAt turn 28, head at (2,6).\n\nIf I go down to (2,5) at t28.\n\nThen t29 to (3,5) as only move.\n\nThen at (3,5), t30 I can go to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nIf go to (3,6), then at (3,6), t31 I can go D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), D to (3,5) might be body or not.\n\nAfter t30: if at t30 from (3,5) go U to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail (4,3) gone.\n\nFrom (3,6), t31 moves: U invalid, D to (3,5) which is body, invalid, L to (2,6) body invalid, R to (4,6) valid.\n\nSo go R to (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6), can go L, D, R, etc.\n\nBut nowhere near (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, if at t30 from (3,5) go R to (4,5), then from (4,5) can go U, D, L, R.\n\nBut (1,1) is far.\n\nBy turn 31, head is at best at (4,5) or (4,6), far from (1,1), so I cannot reach (1,1) in time to eat it before it disappears. Distance from (2,6) to (1,1) is 5 in y-direction, and x is 1, so minimum 5 moves down and left, but left is blocked, so I have to go around, so more than 4 moves, so impossible to eat (1,1) before it disappears. So I should forget about (1,1) and focus on other food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is closer, at (2,3), head at (2,6), distance |2-2| + |6-3| = 0+3=3, so possible in 3 moves, but with body.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), if I go D to (2,5), t28.\n\nThen t29 to (3,5), only move.\n\nThen from (3,5), t30 go L to (2,5)? But (2,5) is body after t29.\n\nAfter t28: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nAfter t29 to (3,5): head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nNow (2,5) is body, so from (3,5), t30 cannot go L to (2,5) because it's body, invalid.\n\nGo U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is free, so go U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nNeither is towards (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), below (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is currently body, and will be for some time.\n\nTo free (2,4), I need to move the snake so that the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move the head right, the body will shift, and eventually (2,4) will be vacated when the tail moves.\n\nTail is at (4,1), and when the snake moves, tail moves.\n\nBut to reach (2,3), I need the head to be at (2,3) when it's free.\n\nSince (2,3) is food, it's there, but I need access.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to (2,5), then to (3,5), then to (3,6), then to (4,6), but that doesn't help.\n\nOr from (3,5) go R to (4,5), then to (4,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (2,3).\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,3) can be eaten if I move the head to (2,3) after the body moves away from (2,4).\n\nCurrently, the body at (2,4) is part of the snake.\n\nThe segment at (2,4) will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move the head to (3,6) at t28, then body shifts, (2,4) might move to a different position.\n\nAfter move to (3,6): new head (3,6), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — so (2,4) is still there, at index 5 or something.\n\nThe position (2,4) is still occupied.\n\nIf I move again, say to (4,6) at t29, then new head (4,6), body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — (2,4) still there.\n\nIt will take many moves for (2,4) to be vacated.\n\nThe tail is at (4,2) after this, and it will move slowly.\n\nTo free (2,4), I need the tail to pass through or something, but it's far.\n\nThe cell (2,4) will be occupied until the segment there moves, which depends on the head movement.\n\nSince the snake is long, it will take time to clear that area.\n\nPerhaps I can move the head down to access (2,3) from the right or something.\n\nFrom current head (2,6), if I go down to (2,5) at t28, then to (3,5) at t29, then from (3,5) I can go down? But (3,4) is body, can't.\n\nGo to (4,5) at t30, then to (4,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\nNot helping.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (6,6) food, which has longer life, 7 turns.\n\nBut it's far, and I need to survive.\n\nFirst, let's avoid getting stuck.\n\nFrom the earlier, going to (2,5) might be risky if I can't escape.\n\nSo safer to go right to (3,6) at t28.\n\nThen from (3,6), at t29, I can go down to (3,5) or right to (4,6).\n\nIf I go down to (3,5), then from (3,5) at t30, I can go left to (2,5) or right to (4,5), as before.\n\nIf I go left to (2,5), I get stuck, as we saw.\n\nSo better not to go to (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), go right to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to various places.\n\nLet's list a sequence.\n\nt28: R to (3,6)\n\nAfter: head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nt29: go D to (3,5)  (since (3,5) is free, and not body)\n\nAfter: head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nt30: from (3,5), go R to (4,5)  (avoid L to (2,5) which is dangerous)\n\nAfter: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nt31: from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\n(4,4) is body, so D invalid.\n\n(3,5) is body, so L invalid.\n\nU to (4,6) or R to (5,5)\n\nSay go U to (4,6)\n\nAfter: head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nt32: from (4,6), can go U invalid, D to (4,5) body invalid, L to (3,6) body invalid, R to (5,6) valid.\n\nGo R to (5,6)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, the food at (2,3) is still there, life span 10, so at turn 28, 10 left, so at turn 32, it has 10 - (32-28) = 6 left? Turn 28:10, t29:9, t30:8, t31:7, t32:6, etc., so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) at turn 28:7, t32:3, etc.\n\nBut to eat (2,3), I need to get the head there.\n\nCurrently, the body is at (2,4), (1,4), etc., blocking access.\n\nI could move the snake in a way that the body shifts and frees the path.\n\nFor example, if I continue moving right and up, the tail will eventually move, and (2,4) will be vacated.\n\nLet's see the tail movement.\n\nIn the current snake, after t28 to (3,6), tail at (4,2)\n\nAfter t29 to (3,5), tail at (4,3)\n\nAfter t30 to (4,5), tail at (4,4)\n\nAfter t31 to (4,6), tail at (3,4)\n\nAfter t32 to (5,6), tail at (2,4)? Let's list positions after each move.\n\nAfter t28 (to (3,6)): positions: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nTail: (4,2)\n\nAfter t29 to (3,5): head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)  tail (4,3) but (4,3) is new position, old tail (4,2) gone.\n\nPositions: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3)\n\nAfter t30 to (4,5): head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  tail (4,4)\n\nAfter t31 to (4,6): head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)  tail (3,4)\n\nAfter t32 to (5,6): head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)  tail (2,4)\n\nAt this point, tail is at (2,4), which was previously occupied.\n\nNow, (2,4) is tail, so if I move the head to (2,4), it would be safe, but (2,4) is not food, food is at (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is below.\n\nAlso, at turn 32, (2,4) is tail, so I can move to it if I want, but it's not food.\n\nTo eat (2,3), I need head at (2,3).\n\nFrom current head at (5,6), it's far.\n\nBut the body at (1,4), (1,5), etc., are still there.\n\nThe area around (2,3) is becoming free as the tail moves.\n\nFor example, after t32, positions include (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4) tail, (2,6), etc.\n\n(2,3) is free, but to reach it, I need to go from (5,6) to (2,3), which is distance |5-2| + |6-3| = 3+3=6, and there are obstacles.\n\nBut life span of (2,3) is long, so I can plan.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is at (6,6), which is close to (5,6) at t32.\n\nAt t32 head at (5,6), (6,6) is food, so I can go right to (6,6) to eat it.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, for turn 28, I need to decide the move.\n\nSince (1,1) is impossible to eat in time, I should go for the safer move to avoid dead ends.\n\nGoing right to (3,6) seems better than down to (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,6), I can then move down or right.\n\nTo reach (2,3) later, I need to free the left side.\n\nBut for now, let's output the move for turn 28.\n\nI think R to (3,6) is good.\n\nThen for future turns, I can plan to eat (6,6) or (2,3).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns, at least from t28 to t28+5 or so, but the format is to list actions for the next turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, so I should list a sequence for a few turns.\n\nSince it's a response, I should provide the actions for the current turn and maybe a few ahead, but the core is to decide the current action with long-term thinking.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nLet's plan a sequence for t28 to t32 or t33.\n\nStart at t28, head at (2,6), direction R.\n\nAction t28: R to (3,6)\n\nNow head at (3,6), direction R.\n\nt29: from (3,6), I can go D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n\nI should go towards the food or open area.\n\n(6,6) is food, so going right might be good.\n\nGo R to (4,6) at t29.\n\nAfter: head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)  tail (4,3)\n\nt30: from (4,6), can go U invalid, D to (4,5), L to (3,6) body invalid, R to (5,6)\n\n(4,5) is free, so go D to (4,5) or R to (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is down, might be better for flexibility.\n\nGo D to (4,5)\n\nAfter: head (4,5), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  tail (4,4)\n\nt31: from (4,5), can go U to (4,6) body invalid, D to (4,4) body invalid, L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\n(3,5) is free? Not occupied, so valid.\n\n(5,5) valid.\n\nGo L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is left, towards the center.\n\nOr go to (5,5) right.\n\nBut to eat (6,6), go right.\n\nt31: go R to (5,5)\n\nAfter: head (5,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)  tail (3,4)\n\nt32: from (5,5), can go U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(5,6) is free, (5,4) free, (4,5) body invalid, (6,5) free.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6) or R to (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\nFor example, at t32 go U to (5,6)\n\nAfter: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)  tail (2,4)\n\nt33: from (5,6), can go D to (5,5) body invalid, L to (4,6) body invalid, R to (6,6), U invalid\n\nR to (6,6) is food, so go R to (6,6) to eat it.\n\nThen snake grows, length 11.\n\nBut for now, I need to output actions from t28.\n\nSince the food at (2,3) is still available, I could try to reach it later.\n\nBut for the sequence, let's go with the above.\n\nAt t28, action R.\n\nThen for t29, I said R to (4,6), but from (3,6), going R to (4,6) is fine.\n\nThen t30 D to (4,5)\n\nt31 R to (5,5)\n\nt32 U to (5,6)\n\nt33 R to (6,6) eat food.\n\nBut I need to list actions starting from t28.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I should list for about 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the state at t28.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) might be eatable if I can get to it.\n\nFrom the snake position, after some moves, the tail moves, and (2,4) becomes tail.\n\nFor example, in the sequence above, at t32, tail is at (2,4), so (2,4) is tail, and (2,3) is below.\n\nIf head can go to (2,3), but head is at (5,6), far.\n\nPerhaps I can go down earlier.\n\nBut it's risky.\n\nI think for now, to maximize score, eating (6,6) is good, and (2,3) can be eaten later if possible.\n\nBut (2,3) has long life, so ok.\n\nSo for turn 28, action R to (3,6).\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 28: R\n\nTurn 29: R (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 30: D (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 31: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 32: U (to (5,6))\n\nThen at turn 33, R to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut I need to list for turns 28,29,30,31,32, for example.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action\", so t1=28.\n\nSo for 5 turns: 28 to 32.\n\nBut at turn 32, head at (5,6), and I go U to (5,6)? No, from (5,5) to (5,6) at t32.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn 28: R (from (2,6) to (3,6))\n\n- Turn 29: R (from (3,6) to (4,6))\n\n- Turn 30: D (from (4,6) to (4,5))\n\n- Turn 31: R (from (4,5) to (5,5))\n\n- Turn 32: U (from (5,5) to (5,6))\n\nThen turn 33 not listed.\n\nFor the answer, I can list these.\n\nBut to think 5+ turns ahead, this sequence is safe and leads to eating (6,6) around turn 33.\n\n(2,3) can be targeted later.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,1) is not an issue in this path.\n\nSo I think this is reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves considering the current state and potential risks over the next 5+ turns. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (1,1) has a short life span (4 turns left, disappears after turn 31) but is unreachable safely within the time limit due to distance and body blockages. Thus, it is ignored.\n  - (6,6) is valuable with a longer life span (7 turns left, disappears after turn 34) and can be reached by turn 33 via a safe path.\n  - (2,3) has a long life span (10 turns left, disappears after turn 37) and can be targeted after securing (6,6).\n\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - Moving down to (2,5) at turn 28 risks trapping the snake by turn 31, as adjacent cells become body-occupied.\n  - Moving right to (3,6) at turn 28 opens a safer path toward (6,6) with minimal collision risk.\n  - The sequence avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions by leveraging tail movement and open spaces.\n\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turns 28-32**: Head moves right and down to position for eating (6,6) by turn 33.\n  - **Beyond turn 32**: After eating (6,6), the snake can target (2,3) by navigating left/down once the body shifts and (2,4) is vacated (expected around turn 33-34 based on tail movement).\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 28 to 32)\n- **Turn 28**: R (right) to (3,6)  \n  - Avoids (2,5) dead end and starts path to (6,6).\n- **Turn 29**: R (right) to (4,6)  \n  - Continues rightward to open space, avoiding body.\n- **Turn 30**: D (down) to (4,5)  \n  - Moves down for flexibility; (4,5) is safe and not body-occupied.\n- **Turn 31**: R (right) to (5,5)  \n  - Positions closer to (6,6) with no immediate risks.\n- **Turn 32**: U (up) to (5,6)  \n  - Final step before eating (6,6) on turn 33; all adjacent cells checked for safety.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake survives, avoids traps, and eats (6,6) by turn 33 for +1 score and growth. After turn 32, the head can move right to (6,6) to eat the food, then consider paths to (2,3).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: R (right)  \nTurn 29: R (right)  \nTurn 30: D (down)  \nTurn 31: R (right)  \nTurn 32: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 29. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,6), then body segments: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). So the tail is at (4,2).\n\nSnake head direction is R, meaning it's moving right. Last move was to the right, so from (2,6) to (3,6) I assume, since positions are head first.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 29, life span 3, so it will be gone after turn 31? Let's clarify: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning after N decreases to 0.\n\nTypically, at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1 or something? I need to be careful.\n\nThe problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, life span is L, then at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it can be eaten only when L >=1, I think.\n\nFor food at (1,1): life span 3 at turn 29. So:\n\n- Turn 29: life span 3\n\n- Turn 30: life span 2\n\n- Turn 31: life span 1\n\n- Turn 32: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 29,30,31.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6): life span 6 at turn 29, so disappears after turn 34.\n\n(2,3): life span 9 at turn 29, disappears after turn 37.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food? Value is 1 for all, so no negative food here.\n\nValue 1, so +1 for eating.\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,6), direction R, so moving right. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R (continue right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because no instant reverse. So possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, grid size: from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Walls at borders, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is death.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), but that's not near current position.\n\nSnake body: let's list all positions to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake segments: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nSo the head is at (3,6), which is occupied, so we can't move there. Body segments are obstacles except the tail, which will move.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to a new cell, and if it's food, it eats, grows, so tail doesn't move. Otherwise, tail moves, so the cell where tail was becomes empty.\n\nBut for collision, we care about where the body will be after move.\n\nStandard snake: after move, head goes to new position, if no food, tail is removed, so the body is the segments except tail is now gone.\n\nBut in terms of collision, we need to check if the new head position is not in the body positions except the tail, because tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment except the current tail, it dies. But if it moves to the current tail position, it's ok only if the tail moves away, meaning it's not growing.\n\nIf it eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail position and eats food there, it might cause collision because tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell? No.\n\nThe food can be under the body, but can only be eaten if head moves to it after the body moves away.\n\nIn this case, for the tail, there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nLet's read: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, if the head is next to the tail, and tail has food, eating that food means snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head moves to tail position, but since tail doesn't move, now head and tail are on same cell? No, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the food is consumed, and snake grows, meaning a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position remains, but head is now on that cell? Let's clarify.\n\nNormally: when head moves to an empty cell, tail moves, so body shifts.\n\nWhen head moves to a food cell, it eats, so tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, if the food is under the tail, and head moves to it, that means head moves to the tail position.\n\nBut tail position: if head moves to tail position, and eats food there, then since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so the new head position is where tail was, and tail is still there? That would be collision.\n\nYes, that's the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to the cell that is the current tail position and that cell has food, then after eating, the head is at that position, and the tail doesn't move, so there is a body segment at the same position, collision.\n\nBut if the food is not under tail, it's ok.\n\nAlso, if head moves to a cell that has food and it's not the tail, but some other body part, but the food can only be eaten if the body moves away first, but in this case, for it to be eatable, the body must have moved away, so it shouldn't be occupied when head moves there.\n\nThe rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo, at the moment head moves to the cell, it must be empty, not occupied by body, except possibly if it's the tail and we don't eat, but for eating, it must be free.\n\nIn the Tail Reward Danger case, it's when the head is adjacent to the tail, meaning tail is next to head, so if head moves to tail position, that cell is currently occupied by tail, so it's not empty, so you can't move there to eat, because the cell is occupied.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo, if food is under a body segment, that cell is occupied, so head cannot move there directly because it's occupied. Only when the body moves away, making the cell empty, then head can move to it to eat.\n\nFor example, if food is under a body segment that is not the tail, when the snake moves, that segment might move away if it's not fixed.\n\nIn particular, for the tail: if food is under the tail, when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, so the cell becomes empty, and then if head moves to it, it can eat, but head moving to that cell would only happen if it's adjacent or something.\n\nBut in Tail Reward Danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nSo, suppose head is at H, tail at T, and |H-T| = 1, adjacent.\n\nIf head moves to T, but T is occupied by tail, so it can't move there because collision.\n\nUnless the tail moves first, but in the move sequence, the head moves first to the new position, then if not food, tail moves, but if food, tail doesn't move.\n\nStandard order: for each turn, head moves to new cell, if it's food, eat and grow (tail stays), else, tail moves (so the cell is freed).\n\nSo, if head tries to move to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it dies immediately, because collision.\n\nIf it moves to the tail cell, it is allowed only if it doesn't eat food, because if it moves to tail and no food, then after head moves to tail position, tail moves away, so no collision. But if there is food on tail cell, and head moves to it, then it eats, so tail doesn't move, and head is now on the same cell as where the tail was, but tail was there, so now two segments on same cell? No: when head moves to a cell with food, it consumes the food, and the snake grows, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo, the new head position is the food cell, and the tail remains, but since it grew, the old tail is still there, and a new segment is added, so the cell that was tail has now the new segment, and head is on the food cell which was the tail cell, so if food was under tail, head moves to tail cell, eats food, so now that cell has the head, and the tail segment is still there, but since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so now head and the segment that was tail are both on the same cell? That causes collision.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nBut in terms of moving to the cell: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it dies. If it is occupied by the tail, it can move there only if it doesn't eat food, because if no food, after moving, tail moves away.\n\nBut if there is food on the tail cell, and head moves to it, since the cell is occupied (by tail), it should be a collision, so you can't even move there.\n\nThe rule says: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away\", so for tail cell, if food is there, the body (tail) must move away before head can move to it.\n\nSo, to eat food under tail, the snake must move such that the tail moves away first, making the cell empty, then later head can move to it.\n\nBut in the Tail Reward Danger, it's when head is adjacent to tail, so if head moves to tail position, it can only do so if no food, and it's safe. If there is food, it can't move there because cell occupied.\n\nBut the danger is when head is adjacent, and tail has food, if head moves to tail, it can't because occupied, so it's not possible to move directly.\n\nPerhaps the Tail Reward Danger is for the case where the tail is about to move away.\n\nLet's read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nI think the key is \"eating it\" – meaning if you manage to eat the food on the tail cell.\n\nBut to eat it, the head must move to the tail cell when it is empty, which requires that the tail has just moved away.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in such a way that the tail moves off the food cell, freeing it, and then head moves to that cell on the same turn? But moves are sequential.\n\nIn one turn: the head moves first to a new cell. If that new cell has food, it eats, and tail does not move. If no food, tail moves.\n\nSo, if the tail cell has food, and head is not on it, it can't be eaten directly.\n\nOnly when the tail moves away, the cell becomes empty, and then head can move to it later.\n\nBut for the head to move to the tail cell immediately after tail moves, they need to be adjacent.\n\nSuppose at turn t, tail is at T with food, head at H adjacent to T.\n\nIf at turn t, the snake moves in a direction such that tail moves away, but the head doesn't move to T.\n\nFor example, if head moves to a different cell, then tail moves, so T becomes empty.\n\nThen at turn t+1, head can move to T to eat the food, but at that point, head is at H, T is empty, but H and T are adjacent only if they were adjacent before, but after move, positions change.\n\nLet's coordinates.\n\nSuppose head at (1,1), tail at (1,2), food at (1,2).\n\nHead is at (1,1), tail at (1,2), so adjacent.\n\nIf at this turn, head moves, say, up to (1,0), then if no food there, tail moves from (1,2) to, say, (1,1) or wherever, but since head moved to (1,0), and if no food, tail moves to the previous head position (1,1)? No.\n\nSnake movement: the body follows the path. When head moves to new position, the second segment moves to where head was, and so on, tail moves to where the second last was.\n\nIn this case, positions: let's say segments: head H, then B1, B2, ..., tail T.\n\nAfter head moves to new cell, if no food, T is removed, so the new tail is what was second last.\n\nIf food eaten, T stays, and a new segment is added at T position? No.\n\nStandard: when head moves to new cell:\n\n- If the new cell has food, the snake grows: the new head position is added, and the tail remains in place, so snake length increases by one, tail position unchanged.\n\n- If no food, the new head position is added, and the tail position is removed, so snake length same, tail moves to what was the second last position.\n\nFor collision: when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it dies. If it is the current tail, it is allowed only if no food is eaten, because if no food, after move, tail moves away. If food is eaten, and head moves to tail, then since tail doesn't move, they collide.\n\nBut if the cell is occupied by tail, and head moves to it, it is a collision only if food is eaten, otherwise not.\n\nThe rule might allow moving to tail cell only when no food.\n\nBut in this game, for simplicity, let's assume that moving to a cell occupied by tail is allowed only if no food is on that cell, and it is safe because tail will move away.\n\nIf food is on tail cell, moving to it is not allowed because the cell is occupied.\n\nThe Tail Reward Danger specifies the case where head is adjacent, so it can move to the tail cell, but if it does and eats, it dies.\n\nSo, probably, the game allows moving to the tail cell, and if there is food, it eats and dies due to collision, or if no food, it moves safely.\n\nIn the description, it says \"eating it kills the snake\", so it is possible to eat, but it causes death.\n\nSo, to avoid that, we should not eat food when it is on the tail and head is adjacent.\n\nIn this state, for the food, let's see if any is under body.\n\nFood at (1,1), (6,6), (2,3).\n\nSnake positions: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nSo, (1,1) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake has (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), but not (1,1), so it's free.\n\n(6,6) free.\n\n(2,3): is (2,3) occupied? Snake positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), etc., not (2,3), so all food is on free cells, not under body.\n\nSo no issue with that for now.\n\nTail is at (4,2), with no food on it, I think. Food at (2,3), not (4,2).\n\nSo Tail Reward Danger not applicable now.\n\nNow, head at (3,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (since not L, reverse forbidden).\n\nLet's see what each move does.\n\nFirst, if move R to (4,6): is this safe?\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6.\n\nWalls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,1), not here.\n\nSnake body: positions include (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), but not (4,6), so empty. (4,6) is free? Let's list all occupied: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). So (4,6) is not occupied, so safe to move.\n\nIf move U to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, so death. Cannot move U, because (3,7) is out of bound or wall, since border y=7 is wall.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,5): (3,5) is not occupied? Snake has (3,6), (3,4), but not (3,5), so should be free.\n\n(3,5) not in positions, so empty.\n\nAlso, walls: y=0 and y=7 walls, x=0,7, but (3,5) is within.\n\nSo possible moves: R to (4,6), D to (3,5), or U? U to (3,7) is wall, so invalid. Only R and D possible? But direction is R, so U and D are possible, but U leads to wall, so only R and D are valid moves.\n\nActions: U, D, R, but U to (3,7) is wall, so death, not allowed. So only possible: R to (4,6) or D to (3,5).\n\nL is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo choices: R or D.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nFirst, let's see the food locations and life spans.\n\nFood at (1,1) life span 3 at turn 29, so can be eaten on turn 29,30,31.\n\n(6,6) life span 6, eaten on 29 to 34.\n\n(2,3) life span 9, eaten on 29 to 37.\n\nAll value 1, positive.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,6), tail at (4,2).\n\nGrid is 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 to 7, walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but internal obstacle at (3,1), which is within.\n\n(3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is border area.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score, but prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach food soon.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom left, with short life, only 3 turns left.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (1,1): distance |3-1| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7, so at least 7 moves away, but life span only 3 turns, so by turn 31, we can't reach it, since turn 29,30,31 to eat, but from (3,6) to (1,1) min moves 7, so impossible to reach before it disappears. So (1,1) is not reachable, ignore.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) at top right, |3-6| + |6-6| = 3 + 0 = 3, so 3 moves away.\n\n(2,3) at left, |3-2| + |6-3| =1 +3=4 moves away.\n\n(6,6) can be reached in 3 moves, and life span 6, plenty.\n\n(2,3) in 4 moves, life span 9, plenty.\n\nBut we need to plan path.\n\nAlso, after moving, snake body changes.\n\nNow, current turn 29, we need to output actions for turn 29,30,31, etc., but the answer format is for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably for the next few turns, but since it says think 5+ turns ahead, I should output at least 5 actions or plan for 5 turns.\n\nBut in the response, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate the next moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 29, head at (3,6), options: R to (4,6) or D to (3,5).\n\nIf we go R to (4,6), then head at (4,6), direction now R (since moved right).\n\nThen possible moves from (4,6): U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, death; D to (4,5); L to (3,6) but reverse? Last direction R, so L is reverse, not allowed; R to (5,6).\n\nSo possible U? U to (4,7) wall, invalid; D to (4,5); R to (5,6).\n\nL is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,6), can go D or R.\n\nIf go R to (5,6), then closer to (6,6).\n\nIf go D to (4,5), then down.\n\nBut let's think about food.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (4,6) to (6,6) is 2 moves right: to (5,6) then (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6), if go R to (4,6), then we can go to (6,6) in two more moves.\n\nBut need to check if path clear.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (5,6): (5,6) is free? Snake positions don't include (5,6), walls not, so free.\n\nThen (5,6) to (6,6): (6,6) has food, and free, so can eat.\n\nNow, life span: at turn 29, food (6,6) life 6, so can eat on turn 31 if we move there.\n\nTurn 29: if we move R to (4,6), no food, so tail moves? Current tail at (4,2), after move, head to (4,6), body: new positions: head (4,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, so snake: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] and tail was (4,2), but since no food eaten, tail moves, so (4,2) is removed, and the new tail is (4,3)? Let's list.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0 head (3,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (1,6), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,2) tail.\n\nAfter move R to (4,6), head to (4,6), no food, so no growth, tail removed, so new positions: head (4,6), then body: [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] and tail (4,2) gone, so new tail is (4,3).\n\nPositions: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — 10 segments? Original 10 segments, after move with no food, should be 10 segments? Head moves to new position, and tail removed, so length same.\n\nOriginal: 10 positions. After: head new, and the body from index 1 to 9 become the new body, but index 1 to 9 are 9 segments, plus head, 10, but tail was index 9, removed, so the segments are: new head (4,6), then the previous head (3,6) is now first body, then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — that's 10 positions, tail at (4,3).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at turn 30, head at (4,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nCan move to (5,6) or (4,5), as we said.\n\nIf move to (5,6): (5,6) free, no food, so move there.\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) and tail? After move to (5,6), no food, tail removed, which was (4,3) before, but now tail is (4,4)? List: new head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — 10 segments, tail (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is now tail.\n\nThen turn 31, head at (5,6), can move to (6,6), which has food, value 1.\n\nMove to (6,6), eat food, so snake grows, tail does not move.\n\nNew head (6,6), and body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) and since ate, add new segment at tail position, so tail now at (4,4), new segment, so positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — 11 segments, tail at (4,4).\n\nWe ate the food at (6,6), score +1.\n\nNow, what about the other option at turn 29: if we go down to (3,5).\n\nAt turn 29, head (3,6), move D to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) free, no food, so move there.\n\nThen positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) and tail (4,2) removed? After move, no food, tail removed: new positions head (3,5), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — tail at (4,3).\n\nDirection now D (down).\n\nThen turn 30, from (3,5), can move: U to (3,6) but reverse? Last direction D, so U is opposite, not allowed. D to (3,4), but (3,4) is body? Positions: (3,6), (2,6), etc., (3,4) is occupied, index 6 in original? After move, positions: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nSo (3,4) is occupied, so if move D to (3,4), collision.\n\nL to (2,5)? (2,5) is not in positions, should be free.\n\nR to (4,5)? (4,5) free.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): since direction D, can move D, L, R, but not U.\n\nD to (3,4): but (3,4) is occupied by body, so death.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) free? No snake there, walls no.\n\nR to (4,5): free.\n\nSo can go L or R.\n\nIf go L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\nBut we want to go to food, say (2,3) or (6,6).\n\n(2,3) is closer if we go left.\n\nFrom (3,5), to (2,5) then to (2,4) but (2,4) is body? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 30, if move L to (2,5), no food, so positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) and tail? Removed (4,3), so new tail (4,4)? Positions: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail (4,4).\n\nDirection now L (left).\n\nThen turn 31, head (2,5), can move L, D, U? Not R reverse.\n\nL to (1,5): but (1,5) is occupied? Positions: (1,5) is body, index 4 or something, in current: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), etc., so (1,5) is occupied, so cannot move to (1,5).\n\nD to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied, body.\n\nU to (2,6): (2,6) is occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells: (1,5) occupied, (2,4) occupied, (2,6) occupied, (3,5) is behind, not adjacent? Adjacent cells: left (1,5), right (3,5) but that's where we came from, direction L, so R is reverse, not allowed. Up (2,6), down (2,4).\n\n(2,6) and (2,4) both occupied, and (1,5) occupied. So no possible move! Death.\n\nIf at turn 30 from (3,5) we go R to (4,5).\n\nTurn 29: moved D to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn 30, move R to (4,5), (4,5) free, no food, so move, tail removed (4,3), so positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) tail (4,4).\n\nDirection now R (right).\n\nThen turn 31, from (4,5), can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6): (4,6) free? Not occupied.\n\nD to (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied, body, death.\n\nR to (5,5): free.\n\nSo can go U or R.\n\nIf go U to (4,6), or R to (5,5).\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), from here we can go to (5,5) then to (6,6) or something.\n\n(4,5) to (6,6) is |4-6| + |5-6| =2+1=3 moves.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nCompared to going right directly from start.\n\nBack to turn 29, if we go right to (4,6), we can reach (6,6) by turn 31 and eat, as I thought earlier.\n\nWith the down move, we got into a bad position where at (3,5) we might be trapped or have fewer options.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,6), we can consider other food.\n\nBut there is also (2,3) with longer life.\n\nBut (6,6) is closer and will disappear sooner relatively, but life span 6, we can eat on turn 31, which is fine.\n\n(2,3) can be eaten later.\n\nNow, after eating (6,6) at turn 31, head at (6,6), direction R? Last move to (6,6) from (5,6), so direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: from (6,6), U to (6,7) wall, death; D to (6,5); L to (5,6); R to (7,6) wall, death.\n\nSo U and R not possible, only D or L.\n\nD to (6,5) or L to (5,6).\n\nNow, (5,6) is body? After eating at turn 31, positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) tail at (4,4).\n\nSo (5,6) is body, so if move L to (5,6), collision.\n\nD to (6,5) should be free.\n\n(6,5) not in positions.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 32, head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nThen can move to, say, (6,4) or (5,5) or (7,5) wall, not, or U to (6,6) but reverse not allowed.\n\nPossible: L to (5,5), D to (6,4), R to (7,5) wall, U reverse not.\n\nSo L or D.\n\nNow, we can go towards (2,3) or other areas.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), we can plan to go there.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother food at (2,3), which is closer to the left side.\n\nSince we are at (6,5), we need to move left and down.\n\nBut let's see the body: snake is long, from (6,6) down to (4,4), and the body has many segments in the left, like (1,6) to (1,4), etc.\n\nTo go to (2,3), we need to navigate without colliding.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), if go L to (5,5), then to (4,5), etc., but (4,5) might be free now.\n\nAt turn 31 after eating, positions include (4,4) tail, and (3,4), etc.\n\nAfter turn 31: head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nNow turn 32: move D to (6,5), no food, so tail moves? Since no food eaten this move, tail moves.\n\nHead to (6,5), not food, so tail removed, which was (4,4), so new positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) — tail at (3,4).\n\n(4,4) removed.\n\nThen from (6,5), move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4).\n\nSay go L to (5,5), free, no food, then positions: head (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) and tail? Tail was (3,4), removed, so new tail (2,4)? Positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — tail (2,4).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe can eventually reach (2,3).\n\nBut since we have to think 5+ turns, and for turn 29, we need to choose action.\n\nIn the first choice, going right leads to eating (6,6) quickly.\n\nGoing down might lead to dead end or slower.\n\nMoreover, in the down move at turn 29, we saw that from (3,5), moving left or right, but if left, we got stuck at turn 31.\n\nIn my earlier, when at (2,5), all moves blocked.\n\nWith going down and then right, we might survive but not efficient.\n\nSo probably better to go right to (4,6) at turn 29.\n\nThen to (5,6) at turn 30.\n\nThen to (6,6) at turn 31, eat.\n\nThen at turn 31, after eating, we must go down to (6,5), as only choice.\n\nThen turn 32, from (6,5), we can go down to (6,4) or left to (5,5).\n\nNow, (2,3) is at (2,3), which is left and down.\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (3,1), but not blocking directly.\n\nTo maximize score, we might want to eat (2,3) next.\n\nFrom current after turn 32, say at (6,5), if go left to (5,5), then we can go to (4,5), (3,5), etc., to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), and life span 9, so we have time.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAfter turn 32: if at (6,5), move L to (5,5), as above.\n\nThen turn 33, head at (5,5), direction L (left? Last move from (6,5) to (5,5), so left, direction L.\n\nThen can move L to (4,5), D to (5,4), U to (5,6) but reverse? Last direction L, so R is reverse, not allowed; U and D possible.\n\nU to (5,6): but (5,6) is body? Positions: after turn 32 move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) tail (2,4).\n\n(5,6) is occupied, so U to (5,6) death.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) free? Not occupied.\n\nL to (4,5): (4,5) free.\n\nSo can go L to (4,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nIf go L to (4,5), then continue left.\n\n(4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,4) but (2,4) is body? Later.\n\nFrom (4,5), can go to (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,3) is below, so need to go down.\n\nBut let's not simulate too far.\n\nFor turn 29, going right seems better.\n\nBut what about the other food (2,3)? If we go down at turn 29, we might reach it faster.\n\nAt turn 29, head (3,6), if move D to (3,5), then as before, at turn 30, we can go R to (4,5), for example.\n\nThen from (4,5), at turn 30.\n\nThen turn 31, from (4,5), can move to (4,4) but occupied? Positions: after turn 30 move to (4,5), head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) tail? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 29 down: head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nTurn 30 move R to (4,5): head to (4,5), no food, tail removed (4,3), so positions: head (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) tail (4,4).\n\nTurn 31, from (4,5), move to, say, U to (4,6) free, or D to (4,4) but occupied, death, or R to (5,5) free.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf go U to (4,6), then direction U.\n\nThen can go to (4,6), which is closer to (6,6), but (6,6) is at (6,6), from (4,6) to (5,6) to (6,6).\n\nBut at turn 31, (4,6) might be free? In this position, (4,6) is not occupied? Positions: (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) so (4,6) not occupied, free.\n\nMove U to (4,6), no food, so tail moves: head (4,6), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) and tail (4,4) removed, so tail now (3,4)? Positions: (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) tail (3,4).\n\nThen turn 32, from (4,6), can go to (5,6) or (4,5) or (4,7) wall.\n\n(4,5) is behind, direction U, so D reverse not allowed? Last move U to (4,6), so direction U, so can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,7) wall; L to (3,6); R to (5,6).\n\n(3,6) is occupied? Positions include (3,6), so cannot.\n\nR to (5,6) free.\n\nSo only R to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 33 to (6,6) if possible, but at turn 32, move to (5,6), then turn 33 to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut turn 33 is later than turn 31, and food (6,6) life span 6, at turn 29 life 6, so disappears after turn 34? Turn 29: life 6, turn 30:5, turn31:4, turn32:3, turn33:2, turn34:1, turn35:0 gone. So can eat until turn 34.\n\nTurn 33 we can eat.\n\nBut with the first plan, we eat at turn 31, earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,3), with first plan, after eating (6,6), we can go to (2,3).\n\nWith second plan, eating later.\n\nBut also, in the down move, we avoided the trap I thought earlier by going right at turn 30.\n\nBut still, going right directly is faster to food.\n\nMoreover, we need to consider the risk: in the down move, from (3,5), if we mistakenly go left, we die, but we can choose to go right.\n\nBut with right move, it's safer and faster to food.\n\nNow, another point: the food at (2,3) might be easier to reach from current position if we go down, but let's see distance.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (2,3): min moves 4, e.g., down to (3,5), then left to (2,5), then down to (2,4)? But (2,4) is body, not free, so need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) to (3,5) to (4,5) to (4,4)? Occupied, or to (3,4) occupied.\n\nHard to reach directly because body is in the way.\n\nBetter to go right first, clear the area, then come back.\n\nSince snake is long, moving away might free up space.\n\nIn first plan, after eating (6,6), the tail is around (3,4), so (2,3) might be accessible.\n\nFor example, from (6,5) after, go left and down to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), and positions: after turn 31, tail at (4,4), etc., (2,3) should be free.\n\nWe can go to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,4) but (2,4) is body? Later.\n\nBut we can go down to (6,4) then left, etc.\n\nI think it's possible.\n\nBut for now, at turn 29, best to go right to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 30 to (5,6).\n\nTurn 31 to (6,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 31, after eating, must go down to (6,5).\n\nThen for turn 32, from (6,5), we need to choose.\n\nBut since we output actions, we can specify.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 29 action.\n\nWe need to output multiple turns.\n\nBut thinking 5 turns ahead: turn 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nIn first plan:\n\nTurn 29: R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 30: R to (5,6)  // since from (4,6), we go to (5,6) to reach (6,6)\n\nTurn 31: R to (6,6) eat\n\nThen turn 31, after eating, head at (6,6), must go D to (6,5) at turn 32? Turn 31 action is to (6,6), which is the move.\n\nAfter turn 31 move to (6,6), we are at (6,6), then for turn 32, we move from there.\n\nTurn 32: from (6,6), we move D to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 33: from (6,5), we can move, say, L to (5,5) or D to (6,4)\n\nNow, to go to (2,3), we might go left.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 34 to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut we don't need to specify all, but for the sequence, we can do turn 29 to 33.\n\nSince food at (2,3) is available, we might head there.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any risk.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant now.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger not applicable.\n\nSo for turn 29, action should be R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 30, from (4,6) to (5,6)\n\nTurn 31 to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 32 to (6,5)  // D\n\nThen turn 33, from (6,5), we can go to (5,5) or (6,4)\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), so moving left is better.\n\nGo to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 34 to (4,5), and so on.\n\nBut since we think ahead, but for output, we can provide the actions we decide.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, we output actions for turn 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nBut turn 33 might be too far, and we need to see the state.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably we need to output a sequence for a few turns.\n\nI think 5 turns is reasonable.\n\nSo for turn 29: R\n\nTurn 30: R (to (5,6))\n\nTurn 31: R (to (6,6) eat)\n\nThen turn 32: from (6,6) only D possible, so D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 33: from (6,5), let's say we go L to (5,5) to head towards left.\n\nThen we can add turn 34 if needed, but 5 turns: 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nTurn 29,30,31,32,33 is 5 actions.\n\nt1=29, then t1 to t1+4: 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nActions: 29:R, 30:R, 31:R, 32:D, 33:L\n\nBut at turn 33, from (6,5) to (5,5), we can.\n\nTo be safe, after turn 32 at (6,5), we could go down to (6,4) to explore bottom, but (2,3) is above bottom, so left is better.\n\n(2,3) is at y=3, so from (6,5), going left and down.\n\nBut (5,5) is fine.\n\nNow, what about the food at (2,3)? It has life span 9, so after turn 33, we can still reach it.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) at turn 33, to (4,5) turn 34, to (3,5) turn 35, to (2,5) turn 36, then to (2,4) but (2,4) might be free by then? Depends on tail movement.\n\nBut we can go to (2,3) directly if possible.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (2,4) or (1,5), but need to see.\n\nBut not necessary for now.\n\nI think the plan is good.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about (1,1) but it's unreachable.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan 5 turns ahead (turns 29 to 33) based on the current state. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (6,6) quickly, as it is only 3 moves away and has a limited life span (disappears after turn 34).\n- Avoid the unreachable food at (1,1) (7 moves away, life span ends at turn 31).\n- After eating (6,6), navigate towards (2,3) for future scoring, but first ensure safe movement to avoid collisions.\n- The snake's current direction is right (R), so reverse (left, L) is forbidden on the next turn.\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 29):\n- **Head position**: (3,6)\n- **Possible moves**: \n  - Up (U) to (3,7): Invalid (y=7 is a wall, death).\n  - Down (D) to (3,5): Safe (empty cell).\n  - Right (R) to (4,6): Safe (empty cell, moves toward (6,6)).\n- **Optimal immediate move**: Right (R) to (4,6) to minimize distance to (6,6) and avoid dead ends.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan:\n1. **Turn 29 (current)**: Move R to (4,6).  \n   - Head moves to (4,6), direction becomes R.  \n   - No food eaten; tail ((4,2)) removed. New tail: (4,3).  \n   - Food life spans decrease: (1,1) life=2, (6,6) life=5, (2,3) life=8.\n\n2. **Turn 30**: Move R to (5,6).  \n   - Head moves to (5,6), direction becomes R.  \n   - No food eaten; tail ((4,3)) removed. New tail: (4,4).  \n   - Food life spans: (1,1) life=1 (can be eaten this turn but unreachable), (6,6) life=4, (2,3) life=7.\n\n3. **Turn 31**: Move R to (6,6).  \n   - Head moves to (6,6), eats food (+1 score, snake grows).  \n   - Tail does not move; new segment added at tail position (4,4). Length increases to 11.  \n   - Direction becomes R.  \n   - Food (6,6) consumed and removed.  \n   - Remaining food: (1,1) disappears after this turn (life=0), (2,3) life=6.  \n   - Now at (6,6), only safe move is down (D) to avoid walls and body.\n\n4. **Turn 32**: Move D to (6,5).  \n   - Head moves to (6,5), direction becomes D.  \n   - No food eaten; tail ((4,4)) removed. New tail: (3,4).  \n   - Food: (2,3) life=5.  \n   - Now positioned to navigate left/down toward (2,3).\n\n5. **Turn 33**: Move L to (5,5).  \n   - Head moves to (5,5), direction becomes L.  \n   - No food eaten; tail ((3,4)) removed. New tail: (2,4).  \n   - Food: (2,3) life=4.  \n   - This move starts the path toward (2,3) (e.g., next moves could be to (4,5) or (5,4) to approach (2,3)).\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Score maximization**: Eats (6,6) on turn 31 for +1 score. Sets up for (2,3) (life span allows eating by turn 37).\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - Avoids dead ends (e.g., moving down on turn 29 could lead to traps near body).\n  - All moves are collision-free and respect movement constraints.\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 33, the snake can safely navigate to (2,3) (e.g., via (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (2,3), ensuring cells are free as tail moves).\n\n### Final Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 30: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 31: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 32: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 33: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 30, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but walls are at the borders, so cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable, I think. Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So, any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacle at (3,1). So playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), but (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). That's 10 segments. Head direction is R, right, so it's moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 2? The format says (x,y, value, life_span), but it's listed as (1,1,2,1). Probably (x,y, life_span, value)? Let me read: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the input it's (1,1,2,1), which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? Inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1,1,2,1) - (6,6,5,1) - (2,3,8,1)\"\n\nIt says \"Life Span and Value\" but in the tuple it's given as (x,y, something, something). Probably (x,y, life_span, value) based on the numbers. For (1,1,2,1), if life span is 2 and value is 1, that makes sense. Similarly, (6,6,5,1) life span 5, value 1? But value 1 for positive food, I think all are positive since it says value 1.\n\nAll food listed have value 1? (1,1,2,1) , (6,6,5,1), (2,3,8,1) — so value is 1 for all, meaning all positive food? But it says \"value and life span\", and for negative food, value is -1, but here all values are 1, so all positive food. Also, life span: for (1,1) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn, so after turn 30 and 31, it should be gone by turn 32? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 30. Life span: for food at (1,1), life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 31? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life span N, it appears for N turns: from the turn it spawns, it counts down each turn, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn? Example: at turn t, if life span is N, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n\nStandard countdown: at turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it has N-1 left, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", meaning that on the turn it spawns, countdown is N, and decreases by 1 each turn, so when countdown is 1, it can be eaten that turn, and then disappears.\n\nFor food at (1,1) with life span 2 at turn 30: on turn 30, countdown=2. After turn 30, countdown=1, so on turn 31, it's still there with countdown=1. After turn 31, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 32. So it can be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 5, so countdown=5 at turn 30, can be eaten until turn 34, disappears before turn 35.\n\n(2,3) life span 8, countdown=8 at turn 30, can be eaten until turn 37.\n\nAll have value 1, so all positive food.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,6), moving right (R), so next move could be U, D, R, but not L since that would be opposite, and no instant reverse. Current direction R, so cannot move L (left) on next turn.\n\nPossible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1), but not L.\n\nNow, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0,7 borders. Internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,6)\n\nBody: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nTail: (4,3)\n\nNow, food at: (1,1), (6,6), (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is a food position, but let's see if it's occupied or not.\n\nSnake occupies: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nSo (1,4) is occupied, but food is at (1,1), which is not occupied. Similarly, (6,6) not occupied, (2,3) not occupied.\n\n(2,3) is a cell, snake has (2,4) and (3,4), etc., not (2,3), so free.\n\nBut (2,3) might be under body? Snake has segments at (2,4), (2,6), etc., but not at (2,3). Let's list all snake positions:\n\n- (4,6) head\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3) tail\n\nSo cells: row y=6: x=1,2,3,4\n\ny=5: x=1\n\ny=4: x=1,2,3,4\n\ny=3: x=4\n\nAnd tail at (4,3)\n\nFood at (1,1), (6,6), (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is empty, not occupied by snake.\n\nNow, head at (4,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6):\n\n- U: (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- D: (4,5) — is this free? Let's see, snake positions: y=5 has only (1,5), so (4,5) should be free? Grid y from 1 to 6, y=5 is valid.\n\nCells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(4,5): not in snake positions, and not wall, not obstacle. Obstacle is only (3,1), so (4,5) is free.\n\n- L: (3,6) but (3,6) is the next body segment, so moving left to (3,6) would be body collision, since it's not the tail? Tail is at (4,3), so (3,6) is body, moving there would collide.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and tail moves, but generally, when moving, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides, except for the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail is safe if tail moves.\n\nIn this case, from (4,6), moving L to (3,6): (3,6) is occupied by the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (4,3), far away. So moving to (3,6) would be collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (4,7) is wall.\n\nMoving D to (4,5) is free.\n\nMoving R to (5,6): (5,6) is within bounds? x=5, y=6, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, so (5,6) should be free. Snake has positions at x=1-4 y=6, but not x=5 or 6, so (5,6) free.\n\nAlso, walls only at borders, so (5,6) is playable.\n\nNow, possible actions:\n\n- U: (4,7) invalid, wall\n\n- D: (4,5) valid and free\n\n- L: (3,6) invalid, body collision (since not tail)\n\n- R: (5,6) valid and free\n\nSo only D or R possible.\n\nBut we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food considerations.\n\nFood at (1,1) with life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 31, else gone.\n\nTurn 30: life span 2, so after turn 30, countdown 1, after turn 31, countdown 0, gone. So can be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n\nSimilarly, other food has more time.\n\n(6,6) life span 5, so until turn 34.\n\n(2,3) life span 8, until turn 37.\n\nNow, head at (4,6), to reach (1,1) quickly: (1,1) is at bottom left, head at top right almost.\n\n(4,6) to (1,1): need to go left and down.\n\nBut currently at (4,6), moving right or down.\n\nIf I move R to (5,6), then I'm further right.\n\nOr D to (4,5), down.\n\nBut (1,1) is urgent because life span short.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is closer, but life span longer.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is near the body.\n\nSnake body: from (1,4) to (2,4) to (3,4), etc.\n\n(2,3) is below (2,4).\n\nNow, to eat (1,1), I need to get to (1,1) by turn 31.\n\nTurn 30: from (4,6), if I move D to (4,5), then at turn 31, head at (4,5).\n\nThen from there, to (1,1), it's at least 3 moves away: e.g., left to (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied by snake body? Snake has (1,5) occupied.\n\nCurrent snake: positions include (1,5), which is a body segment.\n\nTo eat food at (1,1), I need to move head to (1,1) when it's free.\n\nBut (1,1) might be under body or not? Currently, snake is not at (1,1), so it's free.\n\nBut to reach it, I need a path.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (1,1): min distance |dx=3| + |dy=5| = 8 cells, but with obstacles.\n\nBut turns: each move one step.\n\nTurn 30: from (4,6), move to (4,5) or (5,6).\n\nIf move to (4,5), then turn 31 at (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), or D to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake has (4,4) occupied, segment 8th or something.\n\nSnake positions: (4,4) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), but (4,6) is now body? After move to (4,5), the snake moves: head to (4,5), then body segments shift.\n\nImportant to simulate movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it. Tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves away, so the cell is freed.\n\nIn this case, from turn 30, head at (4,6).\n\nIf I move D to (4,5), then new head (4,5), body: the first body segment (3,6) moves to (4,6)? No.\n\nSnake positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nAfter move down to (4,5):\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nThen the body segments: the segment that was at (3,6) moves to the previous head position (4,6)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: the head moves to the new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo, new positions: head to (4,5)\n\nThen segment 1 (was at (3,6)) moves to where head was, (4,6)\n\nSegment 2 (was at (2,6)) moves to where segment 1 was, (3,6)\n\nSegment 3 (was at (1,6)) moves to where segment 2 was, (2,6)\n\nSegment 4 (was at (1,5)) moves to where segment 3 was, (1,6)\n\nSegment 5 (was at (1,4)) moves to where segment 4 was, (1,5)\n\nSegment 6 (was at (2,4)) moves to where segment 5 was, (1,4)\n\nSegment 7 (was at (3,4)) moves to where segment 6 was, (2,4)\n\nSegment 8 (was at (4,4)) moves to where segment 7 was, (3,4)\n\nSegment 9 (was at (4,3)) moves to where segment 8 was, (4,4)\n\nAnd the tail was at (4,3), which is now moved to (4,4), so (4,3) is freed.\n\nNew snake positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nHead at (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved right to (5,6), new positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and (4,3) freed.\n\nBack to turn 30 choices: move D to (4,5) or R to (5,6).\n\nNow, for food at (1,1), need to reach by turn 31.\n\nFrom (4,5) after move, at turn 31, head at (4,5), to (1,1) is |dx=3| |dy=4|, min 7 moves, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,1): need to go left and down.\n\nBut at (4,5), I can move to (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), or (4,6).\n\n(4,4) is occupied by body, as above, after move, (4,4) is part of body, so cannot move there.\n\n(4,6) is also body.\n\n(3,5) might be free? Current after move, cells occupied: see above positions, (3,5) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free, (4,6) occupied, etc.\n\nBut to go to (1,1), from (4,5), best to go left to (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied by snake body? In the new positions, (1,5) is occupied.\n\nIn new positions after turn 30 move D: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nSo (1,5) occupied, (1,4) occupied, (1,6) occupied.\n\nSo to reach (1,1), I need to go down from (1, something), but (1,5) and (1,4) occupied, so I can't go directly to (1,1) from above because (1,2) and (1,3) might be free, but let's see the path.\n\nFrom head at (4,5) turn 31, possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,6): but occupied, collision\n\n- D to (4,4): occupied, collision\n\n- L to (3,5): free? (3,5) not in positions, so yes\n\n- R to (5,5): free\n\nSo from (4,5), can go to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nIf go to (3,5), then at (3,5), next move to (2,5) or (3,4) etc.\n\nBut (2,5): is it free? Current positions, (2,5) not occupied, so free.\n\nThen to (1,5), but (1,5) occupied, so cannot.\n\n(1,5) is occupied, so I can't move to (1,5) from (2,5) because it's body.\n\nFrom (2,5), I could go down to (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied? Positions have (2,4) occupied.\n\nAfter turn 30 move D, positions include (2,4) occupied.\n\nSo from (3,5), if I go to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go to (1,5) but occupied, or (2,4) occupied, or (3,5) but that's previous, or (2,6) occupied.\n\n(2,6) is occupied.\n\nSo from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6) occupied, D to (2,4) occupied, L to (1,5) occupied, R to (3,5) which is previous position but not necessarily occupied now, but when moving, the cell must be free at that time.\n\nAt turn 31, if head at (2,5), but to reach (2,5), from turn 30: if I moved D to (4,5), then at turn 31 I move L to (3,5), so head at (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 31, positions: after moving to (3,5), new head (3,5), body: (4,5) moves to (4,6)? Let's simulate.\n\nTurn 30: after move D, positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nNow turn 31: if move L to (3,5), new head (3,5)\n\nThen body: segment 1 (was at (4,6)) moves to previous head (4,5)\n\nSegment 2 (was at (3,6)) moves to (4,6)\n\nSegment 3 (was at (2,6)) moves to (3,6)\n\nSegment 4 (was at (1,6)) moves to (2,6)\n\nSegment 5 (was at (1,5)) moves to (1,6)\n\nSegment 6 (was at (1,4)) moves to (1,5)\n\nSegment 7 (was at (2,4)) moves to (1,4)\n\nSegment 8 (was at (3,4)) moves to (2,4)\n\nSegment 9 (was at (4,4)) moves to (3,4)\n\nTail was at (4,4), now at (3,4)\n\nNew positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nHead at (3,5), tail at (3,4)\n\nNow (1,1) is still far, and at turn 31, I'm at (3,5), to (1,1) is at least 4 moves away, but turn 31 is the last chance to eat (1,1) because after turn 31 it disappears. So I cannot reach (1,1) by turn 31 from here.\n\nIf at turn 30 I moved directly towards (1,1), but from (4,6), I can only move D or R, not left because left is body.\n\nSo moving D to (4,5) or R to (5,6) both don't get me closer to (1,1) quickly.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), and snake is blocking the left side.\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go down to lower rows.\n\nBut from (4,6), moving D to (4,5) is down, but then I'm still at y=5, need to go to y=1.\n\nThe shortest path might be via (4,5) to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied, so not possible immediately.\n\nFrom (4,6), if I could move left, but I can't.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 31, since at turn 30 I can only move to (4,5) or (5,6), both at least 5-6 moves from (1,1), and turn 31 is last, so (1,1) will disappear without being eaten. So I should forget about it and focus on other food.\n\nLife span 2, turn 30 and 31, but at turn 30 I can't eat it, at turn 31 I might if I were close, but I'm not, so yes, it will expire.\n\nSo ignore (1,1).\n\nNow, other food: (6,6) and (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is closer and has longer life span.\n\n(2,3) at (2,3), value 1, life span 8, so until turn 37.\n\nHead at (4,6), to (2,3) is |dx=2| |dy=3|, min 5 moves, but with obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) at (6,6), |dx=2| |dy=0|, but y same, x from 4 to 6, so 2 moves right.\n\nIf I move R to (5,6), then next to (6,6), I can eat it on turn 31.\n\nIf I move D to (4,5), then I'm farther from (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) has life span 5, so I have time, but it's very close.\n\nAlso, (2,3) is also available.\n\nBut let's think long-term survival.\n\nThe grid is small, 6x6, with snake of length 10, so many cells occupied.\n\nAvailable cells: total cells 6x6=36, snake 10, walls: borders are walls, not cells, so playable cells: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,1), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 10, so 25 free, but with food on some.\n\nFood at (1,1), (6,6), (2,3), so three food, but (1,1) will expire soon.\n\nFree cells include those with food.\n\nBut for movement, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, let's list free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps I should plan a path to eat food and stay safe.\n\nFirst, from (4,6), if I move R to (5,6), then I can eat (6,6) on next turn if I move R again.\n\nBut after eating, snake grows.\n\nIf I move R to (5,6) at turn 30.\n\nNew head (5,6), body: (4,6) moves to (4,6)? Positions: head to (5,6), then segment 1 (3,6) to (4,6), segment 2 (2,6) to (3,6), ..., up to tail (4,3) to (4,4), and (4,3) freed.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nNow, food at (6,6), so at turn 31, I can move R to (6,6), which is free, so eat it.\n\nThen new head (6,6), and since food eaten, snake grows, so tail not removed, new positions: head (6,6), then previous positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and add a new segment at the tail, so the tail stays, positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] and since ate food, length increases, so new tail is (4,4), but (4,4) was tail, now it's body, and a new segment added where tail was? Standard: when eat food, head moves to food, body follows, tail stays, so the new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake extends.\n\nAfter eating, positions: the new head is the food cell, then the previous head, then the body, and the tail remains, so length increases by one.\n\nSo from above, before move, positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nMove to (6,6), eat food, so new positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] and since ate, add a new segment at the end, so the tail was (4,4), new segment at (4,4), so positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), ..., up to (4,4), and new tail at (4,4)? But that's the same cell.\n\nMistake.\n\nWhen snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail moves only if no food, when food eaten, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the current tail position.\n\nSo in this case, before moving to (6,6), tail is at (4,4).\n\nAfter moving head to (6,6), the body segments: (5,6) moves to (5,6)? No.\n\nThe head moves to (6,6), then the first body segment moves to where head was (5,6), second to where first was (4,6), and so on, down to the tail: the segment before tail was (3,4), moves to (2,4)? Let's list indices.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (5,6) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (1,6), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (3,4), 9: (4,4) tail\n\nMove head to (6,6), eat food, so new head (6,6)\n\nThen new segment 1: previous head (5,6)\n\nSegment 2: previous segment 1 (4,6)\n\nSegment 3: previous segment 2 (3,6)\n\nSegment 4: previous segment 3 (2,6)\n\nSegment 5: previous segment 4 (1,6)\n\nSegment 6: previous segment 5 (1,5)\n\nSegment 7: previous segment 6 (1,4)\n\nSegment 8: previous segment 7 (2,4)\n\nSegment 9: previous segment 8 (3,4)\n\nSegment 10: previous segment 9 (4,4)  // this is the old tail position\n\nBut since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, so the tail was segment 9 at (4,4), so new segment 10 at (4,4), and the segments are renumbered.\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — all the same as before except head moved to (6,6), and a new segment added at tail, so positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] with 11 segments, tail at (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is now the 10th segment or something, but it's occupied.\n\nNow, head at (6,6), direction R, but now at border, x=6, y=6.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,7) wall, invalid; D to (6,5); L to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, occupied; R to (7,6) wall invalid.\n\nSo only possible move D to (6,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go down, etc.\n\nBut now the snake is longer, and I'm in the corner.\n\n(6,6) is corner, so after eating, I can only move down to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5), D to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see the other option.\n\nBack to turn 30, if I move D to (4,5) instead.\n\nThen head at (4,5), as before.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards (2,3) or other food.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is close to the body.\n\nFood at (2,3), life span 8, so no rush.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nThere is a danger with the tail: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,3), and no food there, so not an issue now.\n\nBut for example, if food were on tail, and head adjacent, eating it would cause collision.\n\nBut here, no food on tail.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food when possible, but prioritize survival.\n\nAt turn 30, moving R to (5,6) allows me to eat (6,6) on turn 31, gaining +1 and length 11.\n\nMoving D to (4,5) doesn't get food immediately.\n\nBut after eating (6,6), I'm at (6,6) with only one move down, which might be risky if I get trapped.\n\nBut with length 11, in 35-cell grid, 24 free cells, but snake blocks many.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (5,6) to (4,4), as above.\n\nThen I must move to (6,5), assuming it's free.\n\n(6,5) is free, yes.\n\nThen head to (6,5), body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? New head (6,5), then segment 1 (5,6) to previous head (6,6), segment 2 (4,6) to (5,6), etc., down to tail.\n\nPositions: after move to (6,5), no food, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nMove head to (6,5), new head (6,5)\n\nThen segment 1 to (6,6)\n\nSegment 2 to (5,6)\n\nSegment 3 to (4,6)\n\n...\n\nSegment 10 to (3,4)  // let's index: prev segment 9 was (3,4), moves to where segment 8 was? Better to list.\n\nPrev: idx 0: (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (2,6), 5: (1,6), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (3,4), 10: (4,4)\n\nMove head to (6,5), new head (6,5)\n\nThen new segment 1: prev head pos (6,6)\n\nSegment 2: prev segment 1 pos (5,6)\n\nSegment 3: prev segment 2 pos (4,6)\n\nSegment 4: prev segment 3 pos (3,6)\n\nSegment 5: prev segment 4 pos (2,6)\n\nSegment 6: prev segment 5 pos (1,6)\n\nSegment 7: prev segment 6 pos (1,5)\n\nSegment 8: prev segment 7 pos (1,4)\n\nSegment 9: prev segment 8 pos (2,4)\n\nSegment 10: prev segment 9 pos (3,4)\n\nAnd tail was segment 10 at (4,4), so it moves to where segment 9 was, (3,4), so (4,4) freed, new tail at (3,4)\n\nNew positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction down? From (6,6) to (6,5), so direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6) but occupied, collision; D to (6,4); L to (5,5); R to (7,5) wall invalid.\n\nSo D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\n(6,4) might be free, (5,5) free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut the snake is coiled in the top-left, and I'm at bottom-right.\n\nNow, there is food at (2,3), which is near the tail or something.\n\n(2,3) is free, and I can plan to eat it.\n\nBut let's consider the other choice at turn 30: move D to (4,5).\n\nTurn 30: move D to (4,5)\n\nPositions: as earlier, [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] tail at (4,4)\n\nNow at turn 31, head at (4,5), direction down? From (4,6) to (4,5), so D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6) occupied, collision; D to (4,4) occupied, collision; L to (3,5); R to (5,5)\n\nSo L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5), as before.\n\nThen to reach (2,3), from (3,5) I can go down to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied in the current positions.\n\nAfter move to (4,5), positions have (3,4) occupied.\n\nSo from (4,5), if I move L to (3,5), then at (3,5), I can move to (3,4) but occupied, or (2,5), or (3,6) occupied, or (4,5) previous.\n\n(2,5) might be free.\n\nMove to (2,5), then from there to (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, or (1,5) occupied, or (2,6) occupied, or (3,5) previous.\n\nSo stuck? Not necessarily, I can go down to (2,4) later when it's free.\n\nBut currently, to eat (2,3), I need to approach it from above or side.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), so I can go to (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,3) or (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can move to (3,4) only if it's free, but it's occupied now.\n\nAfter some moves, when the snake moves, cells free up.\n\nFor example, if I move from (4,5) to (5,5) at turn 31.\n\nThen head to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) tail at (4,4)\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (5,4), (6,5), (5,6) but (5,6) is occupied, or (4,5) occupied.\n\n(5,6) is occupied, so U to (5,6) invalid, D to (5,4), L to (4,5) invalid, R to (6,5)\n\nSo D or R.\n\nIf move D to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut to get to (2,3), it's slow.\n\nWhereas if I eat (6,6) quickly, I get a point and then have more time for (2,3).\n\nAlso, (2,3) has long life span, so no problem.\n\nBut after eating (6,6), I'm in the corner, which might be risky.\n\nLet's think about the map.\n\nThe snake is currently in a sort of U-shape or something.\n\nPositions: from head (4,6) to (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6) down to (1,5) down to (1,4) right to (2,4) right to (3,4) right to (4,4) down to (4,3) tail.\n\nSo it's like a path: top row from x=4 to x=1 at y=6, then down to y=5 at x=1, down to y=4 at x=1, then right to x=2 y=4, right to x=3 y=4, right to x=4 y=4, then down to x=4 y=3.\n\nSo the area below is relatively free.\n\nFood at (2,3) is at y=3 x=2, which is near (2,4) and (1,4), both occupied.\n\n(2,3) is below (2,4), so to eat it, I need to move to (2,3) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied, but when the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nFor example, if I move down from (4,6) to (4,5), then later I can go to (4,4) when free, but (4,4) is tail now.\n\nAt turn 30, tail at (4,3), after move to (4,5), tail at (4,4) or something.\n\nEarlier simulation.\n\nTurn 30 move D to (4,5): positions [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\nAt turn 31, if I move R to (5,5), for example.\n\nHead to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) but (4,4) is previous tail, and no food, so tail moves.\n\nPrev positions: idx 0: (4,5), 1: (4,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (1,6), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (3,4), 9: (4,4) tail\n\nMove head to (5,5), new head (5,5)\n\nSegment 1 to (4,5)\n\nSegment 2 to (4,6)\n\nSegment 3 to (3,6)\n\n...\nSegment 9 to (3,4)  // prev segment 8 was (3,4), moves to where segment 7 was? \n\nSegment 1: to prev head (4,5)\n\nSegment 2: to prev segment 1 (4,6)\n\nSegment 3: to prev segment 2 (3,6)\n\nSegment 4: to prev segment 3 (2,6)\n\nSegment 5: to prev segment 4 (1,6)\n\nSegment 6: to prev segment 5 (1,5)\n\nSegment 7: to prev segment 6 (1,4)\n\nSegment 8: to prev segment 7 (2,4)\n\nSegment 9: to prev segment 8 (3,4)\n\nAnd tail was segment 9 at (4,4), so it moves to where segment 8 was, (3,4), but segment 8 moved to (2,4), so new position for segment 9 is (3,4), and (4,4) freed.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ] tail at (3,4)\n\nNow (2,3) is at (2,3), which is free.\n\nI can move from (5,5) to (5,4) or (4,5) occupied, etc., but to reach (2,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (5,5), move D to (5,4), for example.\n\nThen to (4,4) when free, but currently (4,4) is free after this move? In new positions, (4,4) is not occupied, it was freed.\n\nAfter move to (5,5), positions have (3,4) but not (4,4), so (4,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free.\n\nSo from (5,5), I can move to (5,4), then to (5,3), or to (4,4), etc., then to (3,3), (2,3) to eat.\n\nBut (2,3) has life span 8, so I have time.\n\nNow, back to turn 30 decision.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (5,6) at turn 30, then at turn 31 move R to (6,6) to eat food, gain point, then at turn 32 must move D to (6,5), then from there I can explore.\n\nAfter eating, length 11, grid 35 cells, so 24 free, but I'm in corner.\n\nOption 2: Move D to (4,5) at turn 30, then at turn 31 I can move to (3,5) or (5,5), and then towards (2,3) or other areas.\n\nWith option 1, I get a point immediately, but risk being in corner.\n\nWith option 2, I don't get point now, but I can go to central area.\n\nBut (6,6) is easy to eat, and I can do it quickly.\n\nAlso, (1,1) will expire, so no loss.\n\nMoreover, the special case: food can spawn under body, but here (2,3) is not under body, it's free.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), which might block paths.\n\nBut for now, let's prioritize eating (6,6) since it's low risk and immediate reward.\n\nThen after that, I can go down to (6,5), then to (6,4), etc., or left to (5,5), etc.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4).\n\n(5,5) might be free.\n\nIn the state after eating (6,6) and moving to (6,5), positions were [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nSo (5,5) is free, (6,4) free, etc.\n\nI can move L to (5,5) from (6,5).\n\nThen from (5,5) to (5,4), etc.\n\nTowards (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), so I can go to (3,3), (2,2), etc.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but not specified, so only current food.\n\nThe state has only these food, so I need to eat them.\n\nTo maximize score, eat all possible.\n\nBut (1,1) will expire.\n\nFor long-term survival, after eating (6,6), the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but in this grid, with 35 cells, length 11, still space.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can eat later, but (6,6) might be eaten by someone? No, only me.\n\nBut it has life span, so if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nLife span 5, so if I don't eat by turn 34, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (2,3).\n\nBut since (6,6) is very close, I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, at turn 30, moving R to (5,6) is safe, then eat at turn 31.\n\nThen for turn 32, move D to (6,5).\n\nThen for turn 33, I can move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4), etc.\n\nI need to think 5 turns ahead, but I have to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the output should be for the current turn and future turns, but the number is not specified, so perhaps for a few turns.\n\nLet's see the format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nBut I have to commit to specific actions.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the state is given at t1=30, I need to output actions for turn 30, 31, 32, etc.\n\nBut how many? Not specified, so I'll do for 5 turns: 30 to 34.\n\nBut let's start.\n\nAt turn 30, I think moving R to (5,6) is better to get the food.\n\nThen turn 31 move R to (6,6) to eat.\n\nThen turn 32, from (6,6), only move D to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 33, from (6,5), I can move to (5,5) or (6,4).\n\n(5,5) is free, as per earlier, and moving left might be towards the center.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is down.\n\nBut to go towards (2,3), moving to (5,5) is better.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 32 move to (6,5), positions: let's simulate.\n\nStart from turn 30.\n\nTurn 30: move R to (5,6)\n\nPositions: head (5,6), body: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4), (4,3) freed\n\nNow turn 31: move R to (6,6), which has food, eat it.\n\nNew head (6,6), then body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) and add new segment at tail, so new tail at (4,4), positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nLength 11.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 32: only possible move D to (6,5), since U and L occupied, R wall.\n\nMove to (6,5), no food there, so tail moves.\n\nNew head (6,5)\n\nThen segment 1 to (6,6)\n\nSegment 2 to (5,6)\n\nSegment 3 to (4,6)\n\nSegment 4 to (3,6)\n\nSegment 5 to (2,6)\n\nSegment 6 to (1,6)\n\nSegment 7 to (1,5)\n\nSegment 8 to (1,4)\n\nSegment 9 to (2,4)\n\nSegment 10 to (3,4)\n\nAnd tail was (4,4), moves to where segment 9 was (3,4), so new position for segment 10 is (3,4), and (4,4) freed? Segment 10 moves to (3,4), but (3,4) was segment 9, which moved to (2,4), so segment 10 to (3,4), and tail was (4,4), which is freed since no new segment.\n\nNew positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ] tail at (3,4)\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6) occupied, invalid; D to (6,4); L to (5,5); R to (7,5) wall invalid.\n\nSo D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nBoth free.\n\nI need to go towards (2,3), which is left and up.\n\nMoving L to (5,5) is better.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (4,5), but (4,5) may be free.\n\nIn current positions, (4,5) not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free, etc.\n\nSo at turn 33, move L to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 34, from (5,5) to (4,5) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (2,3) soon.\n\n(2,3) from (5,5) is |dx=3| |dy=2|, min 5 moves.\n\nBut life span 8, turn 30 to 37, so at turn 33, countdown 5? Life span 8 at turn 30, so countdown 8 at turn 30, after turn 30:7, turn31:6, turn32:5, turn33:4, turn34:3, etc., until turn37:1, after turn37:0 gone. So can be eaten until turn37.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nNow, for the sequence, at turn 33, from (6,5) move L to (5,5).\n\nThen at turn 34, from (5,5), I can move to (4,5), (5,4), (5,6) but (5,6) occupied, or (6,5) previous.\n\n(5,6) occupied, so U to (5,6) invalid, D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) invalid.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf move L to (4,5), then closer to (2,3).\n\n(4,5) to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions only, not the full plan.\n\nSince I have to output for multiple turns, let's say for turns 30 to 34.\n\nBut at turn 34, it depends.\n\nPerhaps I can output the actions for turn 30 and 31, then for later turns, I can choose based on state.\n\nBut the format seems to require a sequence.\n\nLet's see the answer format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how many, so I'll do for 5 turns: 30 to 34.\n\nFirst, turn 30: move R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 31: move R to (6,6) to eat\n\nTurn 32: move D to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 33: move L to (5,5)  // assuming (5,5) free, which it is\n\nThen turn 34: from (5,5), I can move to (4,5) or (5,4). Since (2,3) is at (2,3), moving left to (4,5) is better.\n\n(4,5) is free, as positions after turn 33.\n\nAfter turn 33 move to (5,5):\n\nFrom state after turn 32: positions [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nMove head to (5,5), new head (5,5)\n\nThen segment 1 to (6,5)\n\nSegment 2 to (6,6)\n\nSegment 3 to (5,6)\n\nSegment 4 to (4,6)\n\nSegment 5 to (3,6)\n\nSegment 6 to (2,6)\n\nSegment 7 to (1,6)\n\nSegment 8 to (1,5)\n\nSegment 9 to (1,4)\n\nSegment 10 to (2,4)\n\nAnd tail was (3,4), moves to where segment 9 was (1,4)? Segment 9 was (1,4), moved to (2,4)? Let's index.\n\nPrev: idx 0: (6,5), 1: (6,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (1,6), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (3,4) tail\n\nMove head to (5,5), new head (5,5)\n\nSegment 1 to prev head (6,5)\n\nSegment 2 to prev seg1 (6,6)\n\nSegment 3 to prev seg2 (5,6)\n\nSegment 4 to prev seg3 (4,6)\n\nSegment 5 to prev seg4 (3,6)\n\nSegment 6 to prev seg5 (2,6)\n\nSegment 7 to prev seg6 (1,6)\n\nSegment 8 to prev seg7 (1,5)\n\nSegment 9 to prev seg8 (1,4)\n\nSegment 10 to prev seg9 (2,4)\n\nAnd tail was seg10 at (3,4), moves to where seg9 was (2,4), but seg9 moved to (1,4), so seg10 to (2,4), and (3,4) freed.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4)\n\nNow (4,5) is free, (5,4) free, etc.\n\nAt turn 34, from (5,5), move L to (4,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nI think move L to (4,5) to go towards left.\n\nBut (2,3) is at (2,3), so from (4,5) I can go to (4,4) if free, or (3,5), etc.\n\n(4,4) is free now? In positions, not occupied, yes.\n\nThen to (3,4) but (3,4) was freed earlier, but now not in positions, so free.\n\nThen to (2,4) but (2,4) is tail, but when I move, it might move.\n\nBut for turn 34, I can move to (4,5).\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nSince the sequence might not be optimal, but for the answer, I'll define the actions up to turn 34.\n\nTurn 30: R\n\nTurn 31: R (to eat)\n\nTurn 32: D (only choice)\n\nTurn 33: L (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 34: L (to (4,5))\n\nThen from there, I can continue to (3,5), (2,5), etc., but (2,5) might be free, then to (2,4) when free, but (2,4) is tail, so when head adjacent, but if food on tail, danger, but no food now.\n\nTo eat (2,3), I need to be at (2,3), so from (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,3) or (2,2).\n\n(2,4) is occupied, so I can go to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nBut later.\n\nFor now, the sequence is fine.\n\nIf at turn 30 I moved D to (4,5), then I might not get the food immediately, but I can go to (2,3) directly, but it's slower.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) turn 30, then turn 31 move L to (3,5), turn 32 move to (2,5), then turn 33 to (2,4) but occupied, or (3,4) occupied, or (1,5) occupied, or (2,6) occupied, so I have to move to (2,4) when free, but at that time, I might move to (3,4) if free, but it's messy.\n\nWith the first choice, I get a point and then move towards the other food.\n\nSo I think moving R at turn 30 is better.\n\nAlso, for the tail reward danger, not an issue.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of actions considering the food positions, life spans, snake body, and movement constraints. The key decisions are:\n\n- **Turn 30**: Move right (R) to (5,6) to position for eating the positive food at (6,6) on the next turn. Moving down (D) is possible but delays accessing food and may lead to less efficient paths.\n- **Turn 31**: Move right (R) to (6,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 11). This is safe and exploits the immediate reward.\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (6,5), as it is the only safe move from (6,6) (up and left are blocked by body or walls).\n- **Turn 33**: Move left (L) to (5,5) to head toward the remaining food at (2,3) and avoid the corner.\n- **Turn 34**: Move left (L) to (4,5) to continue toward (2,3), which has a long life span (can be eaten until turn 37). This path avoids risks and keeps the snake centered.\n\n### Reasoning Details:\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (1,1) has a life span of 2 (expires after turn 31) but is unreachable by turn 31 due to distance and body blocks, so it is ignored.\n  - (6,6) is eaten on turn 31 for immediate reward (+1) and to prevent it from expiring (life span 5, expires after turn 34).\n  - (2,3) has a life span of 8 (eaten until turn 37) and will be targeted after turn 34.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Moving to (6,6) is safe as the cell is free and no tail reward danger exists.\n  - Post-eating, moving down to (6,5) avoids corner trapping.\n  - The sequence avoids body collisions and walls; all moves comply with no instant reverse.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - After eating (6,6), the snake moves left to open areas, reducing dead-end risks.\n  - The grid has 35 playable cells; after growth, 24 free cells remain, allowing maneuverability.\n  - Planning beyond turn 34 focuses on reaching (2,3) safely (e.g., via (4,5) → (4,4) or (3,5) → (3,4) → (2,3)), but detailed moves depend on future states.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: R (right)  \nTurn 31: R (right)  \nTurn 32: D (down)  \nTurn 33: L (left)  \nTurn 34: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 31. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and one wall inside at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,6), then body segments: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (5,6) from (4,6).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (6,6) with value 4, life span 1? Wait, the format says: (x,y, life_span, value). Let me check the input.\n\nIt says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 1, 1, 1) - (6, 6, 4, 1) - (2, 3, 7, 1) - (5, 3, 10, 1)\"\n\nI think it's (x,y, life_span, value). So:\n\n- (1,1): life_span=1, value=1 → positive food, disappears after turn 31 if not eaten (since life_span decreases each turn, including current)\n\nLife span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life_span L on turn T, it will disappear at the end of turn T + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on the turn it's spawned, countdown is N. After that turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nIn this case, for (1,1): life_span=1, so on turn 31, countdown=1, and after turn 31, it will disappear. So it must be eaten on turn 31 to be collected.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6): life_span=4, value=1? Wait, value=1, but it says value=1 for all? No: (1,1,1,1) means x=1,y=1, life_span=1, value=1\n\n(6,6,4,1) means x=6,y=6, life_span=4, value=1\n\n(2,3,7,1) x=2,y=3, life_span=7, value=1\n\n(5,3,10,1) x=5,y=3, life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll have value=1, so all are positive food? But the input says \"value1, value2\", but here all values are 1. And negative food has penalty -1, but all values are positive here, so all are positive food? Let me confirm.\n\nThe food list: (1,1,1,1) — value=1, positive.\n\n(6,6,4,1) — value=1, positive.\n\n(2,3,7,1) — value=1, positive.\n\n(5,3,10,1) — value=1, positive.\n\nNo negative food mentioned. So all food is positive, which is good.\n\nBut life spans vary.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,6), direction right. So it just moved to (5,6) from left, since previous position was (4,6).\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is right, it can move up, down, or right, but not left because left would be opposite direction? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is right, so cannot move left on this turn. So possible moves: up, down, right.\n\nNow, coordinates: let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid: 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,6)\n\nBody: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (5,6) head\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,4) tail\n\nNow food:\n\n- (1,1) — life span 1, must be eaten this turn or gone.\n\n- (6,6) — life span 4, so available for 4 more turns including this? Life span 4 on turn 31: countdown starts at 4, decreases each turn. So after turn 31, countdown=3; after turn 32, countdown=2; after turn 33, countdown=1; after turn 34, countdown=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 31,32,33,34.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): life span 7, so available for 7 turns including turn 31.\n\n(5,3): life span 10, available for 10 turns.\n\nNow, (1,1) has only this turn to be eaten.\n\nBut where is (1,1)? x=1,y=1. Is it accessible?\n\nSnake body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) are at x=1, y=6,5,4. (1,1) is at y=1, so it's not under snake, I think. Snake has segments at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but (1,1) is empty, I assume.\n\nCells not listed as snake or wall are free, except for food.\n\n(1,1) is a free cell with food.\n\nBut to eat it, head must move to (1,1) when it's free.\n\nCurrently head at (5,6), (1,1) is far away. Distance: |5-1|=4 in x, |6-1|=5 in y, so at least 9 moves away? But snake can move one step per turn, so it would take multiple turns to reach, but (1,1) disappears after this turn, so impossible to eat it. Life span 1, on turn 31, it must be eaten now or gone. Since head is at (5,6), not adjacent to (1,1), cannot eat it this turn. So (1,1) will disappear and cannot be eaten. Ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nNow, head at (5,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (5,7) — but y=7 is wall, since border y=7 is wall. So (5,7) is wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Down: to (5,5) — is this free? Let's see occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\n(5,5) not listed, so should be free? Also, no wall at (5,5), walls are borders and (3,1).\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (5,5) is within bounds, not wall, not occupied by snake, so free.\n\n- Right: to (6,6) — (6,6) has food! And it's free? (6,6) is a food position, and not occupied by snake, so yes, it's a cell with food.\n\n- Left: but cannot move left because opposite direction; current direction right, so left is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (5,5) or right to (6,6).\n\nIf move right to (6,6), it eats the food there. Value=1, positive, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nAfter eating, new head position (6,6), and tail stays, so snake length becomes 11.\n\nBut (6,6) is at the border? x=6, y=6, borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,6) is not border, it's fine.\n\nNow, life span of this food is 4, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nIf move down to (5,5), no food there, so no growth, head moves to (5,5), tail moves to next position, which is (4,4)? Snake movement: when head moves, if not eating, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nCurrent tail is (4,4), so if move down to (5,5), new head (5,5), body: (5,6) becomes first body segment, then (4,6), (3,6), ..., up to (1,4), and tail (2,4)? Positions: after move down to (5,5), snake: head (5,5), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and since tail was (4,4), it moves off? When no food eaten, the tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n\nCurrent segments: index 0: (5,6) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (1,6), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (3,4), 9: (4,4) tail.\n\nIf move to (5,5), new head (5,5), then body segments: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). The tail (4,4) is removed, so segments 1 to 9 become body, but without the last one. New positions: head (5,5), then segments 0 becomes body at (5,6), segment 1 at (4,6), ..., up to segment 8 at (3,4), and segment 9 (tail) removed. So body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) — that's 9 segments including head? Head is new, so positions: [ (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ] — that's 10 positions? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell without eating, the tail end is removed. So the snake shortens temporarily before the tail moves.\n\nStandard snake: if no food, head moves to new cell, the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo here: head from (5,6) to (5,5), so new head at (5,5). The body segments remain, but the last segment (tail) is removed. So the segment that was at (4,4) is removed, and all other segments shift: the segment at (5,6) is now the first body segment, (4,6) second, etc., down to (3,4) which was the second last, now last? List indices.\n\nBefore move: positions: idx 0: (5,6) head, idx1: (4,6), idx2: (3,6), idx3: (2,6), idx4: (1,6), idx5: (1,5), idx6: (1,4), idx7: (2,4), idx8: (3,4), idx9: (4,4) tail.\n\nAfter move down to (5,5): new head at (5,5). Then the body: idx0 (old head) becomes body at (5,6), idx1 at (4,6), ..., up to idx8 at (3,4). idx9 (4,4) is removed. So new positions: [ (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ] — that's 10 segments? (5,5) head, (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) — yes, 10 segments, but we removed the tail, so it should be 9.\n\nI think I confused. The snake has 10 segments. When it moves without eating, it remains the same length, but the head moves forward, and the tail moves forward, so the last position is abandoned.\n\nSo after moving to (5,5): head is at (5,5). The first body segment is the old head at (5,6). Then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and the old tail at (4,4) is removed, but since the tail moves, the new tail is what was the second last segment, which is (3,4).\n\nPositions: new head: (5,5)\n\nThen the segments from old idx0 to idx8 become the body, but shifted: old idx0 is now at position 1: (5,6)\n\nold idx1 at position 2: (4,6)\n\n...\n\nold idx8 at position 9: (3,4)\n\nand old idx9 (tail) is gone, so the new tail is at (3,4), and there are 9 segments now? No: the snake has one less segment only if it doesn't eat, but it should stay the same length.\n\nStandard: when no food, snake moves, head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nNumber of segments remains the same, but the tail cell changes.\n\nHere: after move to (5,5), the new positions:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 1: old head position (5,6)\n\n- Segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,6)\n\n- Segment 3: old segment 2 position (3,6)\n\n- Segment 4: old segment 3 position (2,6)\n\n- Segment 5: old segment 4 position (1,6)\n\n- Segment 6: old segment 5 position (1,5)\n\n- Segment 7: old segment 6 position (1,4)\n\n- Segment 8: old segment 7 position (2,4)\n\n- Segment 9: old segment 8 position (3,4)\n\nOld segment 9 position (4,4) is vacated.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)] — still 10 segments? But (5,5) is new, (5,6) was head, now body, (4,6) was body, etc., down to (3,4) which was segment 8, now segment 9, and old segment 9 (4,4) is gone, so the last segment is now (3,4), but the number is the same because we added a new head and removed the tail.\n\nPositions: 10 positions listed, but from (5,5) to (3,4), yes 10 cells. Original had 10 segments, after move no eat, still 10 segments, but the snake has moved, so tail is at (3,4) instead of (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, if it eats, it grows to 11 segments.\n\nBack to the move.\n\nAt (5,6), can move down to (5,5) or right to (6,6).\n\nIf move right to (6,6), it eats the food at (6,6), so snake grows: new head at (6,6), and the tail does not move, so new positions: head (6,6), then body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail at (4,4) still, and length 11.\n\nIf move down to (5,5), no eat, positions as above.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, consider the food at (2,3) and (5,3), which are closer.\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3, value 1, life span 7, so available for several turns.\n\n(5,3) at x=5,y=3, value 1, life span 10.\n\nNow, current head at (5,6).\n\nIf I move right to (6,6), I eat the food, grow to 11. Then head at (6,6), direction right.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: up, down, right. Left would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nBut up: (6,7) is y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nDown: (6,5) — is it free? Currently, snake has (6,6) head, but after move, positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), etc., and (6,5) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nRight: (7,6) — x=7 is wall, cannot move.\n\nSo from (6,6), only down to (6,5) possible? Or left, but left to (5,6) is where the body is, but (5,6) is the first body segment after head, so moving left to (5,6) would cause collision, since it's occupied by body.\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, but in this case, after moving to (6,6), the body includes (5,6), which is adjacent.\n\nIf I move left from (6,6) to (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied by the snake body, so collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, down to (6,5) is free, so possible.\n\nBut only one choice: down to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to choose between moving right to eat food or down to avoid for now.\n\nMoving right to (6,6) eats food, but then I'm at (6,6) with only one way out: down to (6,5). Then from (6,5), I can move left, down, or right? Directions: head direction after moving right to (6,6) is right. Then from (6,6) to (6,5) is down, so new direction down.\n\nThen possible moves from (6,5): down to (6,4), left to (5,5), right to (7,5) but x=7 wall, cannot. Or up to (6,6), but (6,6) is body now, collision.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), etc.\n\nSo (6,6) is adjacent and occupied, so cannot move up to (6,6).\n\n(7,5) wall.\n\nSo possible: down to (6,4) or left to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) might be free or not, depending.\n\nIf I had moved down from (5,6) to (5,5), then head at (5,5), direction down (since moved down).\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: left to (4,5), down to (5,4), right to (6,5), or up to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision.\n\nCurrent direction down, so cannot move up (reverse).\n\nSo possible: left to (4,5), down to (5,4), right to (6,5).\n\nAll might be free.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThere is food at (5,3) and (2,3).\n\n(5,3) is below, at same x, y=3.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (5,3) is down, but there are body segments in the way.\n\nSnake body: from (5,6) down to (5,5) might be free, but below, (1,5), (1,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,3), need to go down.\n\nBut at (5,4)? Is it occupied? Snake has (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), but not (5,4) yet. (5,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) has food.\n\nAlso, (2,3) has food.\n\nNow, if I move down to (5,5) now, I can then move down to (5,4), then to (5,3) to eat food.\n\n(5,3) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, at turn 31, head at (5,6).\n\nOption 1: move right to (6,6), eat food, grow to 11 segments. Then only move down to (6,5). Then at (6,5), I can move left to (5,5) or down to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) might be occupied later.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6) and eating, positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail (4,4).\n\nThen move down to (6,5): new head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), ..., up to (3,4), and tail (4,4) removed? No, since ate food, no tail move, so positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and (4,4) tail, since growth, tail stays.\n\nLength 11.\n\nFrom (6,5), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: left to (5,5), down to (6,4), or right to (7,5) wall, up to (6,6) body, so only left or down.\n\n(5,5) : is it free? Currently, no snake there yet. In this state, after move to (6,5), (5,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) free.\n\nIf I go left to (5,5), then I can access the bottom area.\n\nBut I need to think about other food.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is near the body.\n\nCurrent body has (1,4), (2,4), (1,5), etc.\n\n(2,3) is below (2,4).\n\nIf I can move to (2,3), but need to have head there.\n\nNow, back to turn 31 decision.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5) instead of right.\n\nAt (5,6), move down to (5,5), no eat, so positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (3,4), since (4,4) removed.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: left to (4,5), down to (5,4), right to (6,5).\n\n(4,5): free? No snake, no wall.\n\n(5,4): free, and then to (5,3) with food.\n\n(6,5): free.\n\nI could go down to (5,4) next, then to (5,3) to eat.\n\n(5,3) life span 10, so I can eat it on turn 33, for example.\n\nTurn 31: move to (5,5)\n\nTurn 32: move to (5,4)\n\nTurn 33: move to (5,3) eat food.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (2,3) is also available, life span 7.\n\nBut (2,3) might be harder to reach because of the body.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant immediately.\n\nNow, compare to moving right first.\n\nIf move right to (6,6) on turn 31, eat food.\n\nThen turn 32: move down to (6,5)\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move left to (5,5) or down to (6,4).\n\nIf I move left to (5,5) on turn 32, then I am at (5,5) on turn 32, same as if I had moved down directly on turn 31.\n\nBut by moving right, I ate a food, so I have an extra segment.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go down to (5,4) on turn 33, etc.\n\nBut the snake is longer, which might be a problem for maneuvering.\n\nThe grid is small, 8x8, with obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. And internal (3,1) wall.\n\nSnake: head (5,6), body: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nFree cells: for example, (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) with food, (6,6) with food, (6,5), (6,4), etc. (2,3) with food, (3,3), (3,2), (4,3), (4,2), etc. But (3,1) wall, so (3,2) might be free.\n\nFood at (2,3) and (5,3).\n\n(2,3) is adjacent to (2,4), which is body segment. (2,4) is part of snake.\n\nIf the head moves to (2,3), it can eat the food, but need to be careful of tail danger.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, the food is at (2,3), not on tail.\n\nTail is at (4,4) currently.\n\nAfter moves, tail moves.\n\nBut for (2,3), it's not on tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut to reach (2,3), from current position.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), if I go down to (5,5), then down to (5,4), then left to (4,4) or something, but (4,4) is tail now.\n\nLet's think paths.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, I should simulate both options.\n\nFirst option: move right to (6,6) on turn 31, eat food.\n\nThen turn 32: must move down to (6,5), as only choice.\n\nNow at (6,5), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (6,4) or left to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nIf I move left to (5,5) on turn 32.\n\nThen head at (5,5), direction left? Moved from (6,5) to (5,5), so left.\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: down to (5,4), left to (4,5), or up to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision. Cannot move right because opposite direction? Current direction left, so cannot move right (reverse).\n\nSo possible: down to (5,4) or left to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) free, (5,4) free.\n\nSay I move down to (5,4) on turn 33.\n\nThen to (5,3) on turn 34 to eat food at (5,3).\n\nBut on turn 34, eat (5,3).\n\nMeanwhile, food at (2,3) is there, life span 7, so by turn 31+7=38, it disappears.\n\nTurn 34 is fine.\n\nBut after eating (5,3), head at (5,3), then I can go left or down, etc.\n\nBut the snake is longer, 11 segments after first eat, then 12 after (5,3).\n\nSecond option: on turn 31, move down to (5,5), no eat.\n\nThen at (5,5), direction down.\n\nTurn 32: move down to (5,4), no eat, positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — tail (2,4)? After turn 31 move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter turn 32 move down to (5,4): head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — and tail (3,4) removed? Old tail was (3,4), removed, so new tail is (2,4).\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — tail (2,4).\n\nThen turn 33: move down to (5,3), eat food at (5,3), so grow, head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), ..., (2,4), and tail not removed, so positions include (2,4) still.\n\nLength 11 after eating.\n\nCompared to first option, in first option I ate two foods by turn 34, here I ate one by turn 33.\n\nBut in first option, I ate (6,6) on turn 31 and (5,3) on turn 34, so two foods.\n\nHere, only (5,3) on turn 33.\n\nBut I can eat (2,3) later.\n\nNow, (2,3) is available.\n\nHow to reach (2,3) from current.\n\nAfter turn 33, head at (5,3), after eating.\n\nThen I need to go left to (4,3), then (3,3), then (2,3) or something.\n\nBut (3,3) might be free.\n\nAlso, the body is around.\n\nFor example, after head at (5,3), positions: let's say after turn 33 in second option: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — since ate, tail at (2,4).\n\nNow (2,3) is adjacent to (2,4), which is tail.\n\nIf I move left to (4,3) on turn 34, then to (3,3) on turn 35, then to (2,3) on turn 36.\n\nOn turn 36, move to (2,3), which has food, so eat it.\n\nBut head at (2,3), and tail is at... where is tail at that time?\n\nAfter turn 33: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) tail.\n\nTurn 34: move left to (4,3). Since no eat, tail moves. Head to (4,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — tail (2,4) removed? New positions: head (4,3), then old head (5,3) body, (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and old tail (2,4) removed, but (1,4) is still there? Segments: after move, head (4,3), body 1: (5,3), body 2: (5,4), body 3: (5,5), body 4: (5,6), body 5: (4,6), body 6: (3,6), body 7: (2,6), body 8: (1,6), body 9: (1,5), and body 10: (1,4)? Old positions had (1,4) and (2,4), but (2,4) was tail, removed, so the last body is (1,5)? Let's list:\n\nBefore turn 34 move: positions: idx0: (5,3) head, idx1: (5,4), idx2: (5,5), idx3: (5,6), idx4: (4,6), idx5: (3,6), idx6: (2,6), idx7: (1,6), idx8: (1,5), idx9: (1,4), idx10: (2,4) tail? Length 11, indices 0 to 10.\n\nAfter move left to (4,3) no eat: new head (4,3), then body: old idx0 at (5,3) now body, old idx1 at (5,4) body, ..., old idx9 at (1,4) body, old idx10 (tail) at (2,4) removed. So new positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — tail (1,4).\n\nThen turn 35: move to (3,3)? From (4,3), can move left to (3,3) or down to (4,2) etc.\n\nMove left to (3,3): head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail (1,4) removed, new tail (1,5).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nThen turn 36: move to (2,3), which is food. Eat it, so head (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (1,6), (1,5), and tail not removed, so length 12.\n\nBut is (2,3) free? Yes, and no issue with tail danger because tail is at (1,5), not adjacent.\n\n(2,3) and (1,5) are not adjacent.\n\nSo can eat safely.\n\nSimilarly, in the first option, I could do similar but with longer snake.\n\nBut in the first option, by moving right first, I ate an extra food at (6,6), so I have more score.\n\nBut is there risk?\n\nIn the first option, when I moved to (6,6), then to (6,5), I am near the border.\n\nFrom (6,5), if I move down to (6,4), then I am at bottom right, which might be harder to escape.\n\nFor example, from (6,4), possible moves: left to (5,4), down to (6,3), or right to (7,4) wall, up to (6,5) body.\n\nSo left or down.\n\nIf down to (6,3), then to (6,2), etc., but I need to go left eventually to get to the other food.\n\nBut it might be tight with the long snake.\n\nIn the second option, by not eating (6,6) now, I can eat (5,3) sooner, and then (2,3).\n\nBut (6,6) has life span 4, so I can eat it later if I want.\n\nLife span 4 on turn 31, so available until turn 34 inclusive? Countdown: turn 31: countdown 4, turn 32: 3, turn 33: 2, turn 34: 1, turn 35: 0 disappear. So can eat on turns 31,32,33,34.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I can eat it later, but I need to be able to reach it.\n\nFrom current, if I move down to (5,5), then to (5,4), to (5,3), I am at (5,3) on turn 33.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go right to (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) to eat on turn 36, but (6,6) disappears after turn 34? Turn 34 is last chance, countdown 1 on turn 34, eat on turn 34, disappears after.\n\nTurn 35 it's gone.\n\nSo from (5,3) on turn 33, I can go to (6,3) on turn 33? On turn 33, head at (5,3), then move right to (6,3) on turn 33? Turn 33: from (5,3) to (6,3), then turn 34 to (6,4), but (6,6) is at y=6, so from (6,4) to (6,5) turn 35, but turn 35 (6,6) gone, cannot eat.\n\nTurn 33: at (5,3), move to (6,3)\n\nTurn 34: from (6,3) move to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,6) is not reached, and on turn 34, (6,6) can be eaten if head there, but from (6,4), I can move to (6,5) or (6,6)? From (6,4), possible moves: up to (6,5), down to (6,3), left to (5,4), etc.\n\nIf I move up to (6,5) on turn 34, then (6,6) is above, but to go to (6,6) on turn 34, I need to be at (6,5) or (5,6) or (7,6) but walls, or (6,7) wall.\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 34, if I move up to (6,5), I am at (6,5), but (6,6) is not eaten yet, and I can move to (6,6) on turn 35, but turn 35 (6,6) disappears, so cannot eat.\n\nTo eat (6,6) on turn 34, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 33.\n\nOn turn 33, if I am at (6,5) or (5,6) or (7,6) invalid, or (6,7) invalid.\n\n(5,6) is occupied by body, as we saw earlier.\n\nIf I am at (6,5) on turn 33, then on turn 34 I can move up to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut how to be at (6,5) on turn 33.\n\nIn the path where I go to (5,3) on turn 33, I am not near (6,5).\n\nFor example, if on turn 31 I move down to (5,5), turn 32 to (5,4), turn 33 to (5,3) eat.\n\nAt turn 33, head at (5,3).\n\nTo reach (6,6) by turn 34, I need to be adjacent on turn 33, but (5,3) is not adjacent to (6,6); distance |5-6|=1, |3-6|=3, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,6) are (6,5), (6,7), (5,6), (7,6).\n\n(6,7) and (7,6) walls, (5,6) is body, so only (6,5) is possible.\n\nSo on turn 33, I need to be at (6,5) to move to (6,6) on turn 34.\n\nBut from (5,3) on turn 33, I can go to (6,3) or (5,2) or (4,3), not directly to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is two moves away: e.g., (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,4) to (6,5) on turn 35, too late.\n\nSo if I don't eat (6,6) on turn 31, I probably cannot eat it later because I'm going down to (5,3) and it's hard to reach (6,6) in time.\n\nWhereas (2,3) has more life span, 7, so I can reach it later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) has life span 10.\n\nSo if I move down to (5,5) on turn 31, I can eat (5,3) on turn 33 and (2,3) on turn 36, as before.\n\nBut I miss (6,6).\n\nIf I move right to (6,6) on turn 31, I eat it, then go to (6,5) on 32, then to (5,5) on 33, then to (5,4) on 34, then to (5,3) on 35 to eat (5,3), but (5,3) life span 10, turn 35 is fine.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3) later.\n\nAnd I have one more food eaten.\n\nMoreover, by moving right, I avoid being trapped in the left area.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is moving, so space might open up.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (4,4) now, but as snake moves, tail moves, so cells like (3,4) etc. might be freed.\n\nIn the move right option, on turn 31: move right to (6,6) eat, positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) tail\n\nTurn 32: move down to (6,5), no eat (since no food there), so tail moves. Head to (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (4,4) removed, new tail (3,4)\n\nPositions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) tail\n\nTurn 33: move left to (5,5), for example. Head to (5,5), body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — tail (3,4) removed, new tail (2,4)\n\nNow head at (5,5), direction left (since moved left from (6,5)).\n\nTurn 34: move down to (5,4), no eat? (5,4) has no food, but (5,3) has food. Move to (5,4), then turn 35 to (5,3) eat.\n\nOn turn 34: from (5,5) move down to (5,4), head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail (2,4) removed? Old tail was (2,4), removed, but positions: after move, head (5,4), body old head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), ..., up to (1,5), and old tail (2,4) removed. But (1,4) is still there? Segments: idx0: (5,5) before move, idx1: (6,5), idx2: (6,6), idx3: (5,6), idx4: (4,6), idx5: (3,6), idx6: (2,6), idx7: (1,6), idx8: (1,5), idx9: (1,4), idx10: (2,4) tail? Length 11.\n\nAfter move down to (5,4) no eat: new head (5,4), then body: old idx0 at (5,5), old idx1 at (6,5), old idx2 at (6,6), ..., old idx9 at (1,4), old idx10 (tail) at (2,4) removed. So new positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — tail (1,4)\n\nThen turn 35: move down to (5,3), eat food, head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), ..., (1,5), (1,4), tail not removed, so length 12.\n\nNow, compared to not eating (6,6), I have an extra point.\n\nAnd I can still go to (2,3).\n\nAfter (5,3), go left to (4,3), etc., to (2,3).\n\nNo problem.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,6), I only get (5,3) and (2,3), but not (6,6).\n\nSo moving right to eat (6,6) seems better for score.\n\nBut is there risk in moving to (6,6)?\n\nAt (6,6), I have to move down to (6,5), which is safe.\n\nThen from (6,5), moving left to (5,5) is fine.\n\nThe snake is longer, but the grid has space.\n\nAnother food is (2,3), which I can eat later.\n\nLife span 7, so by turn 38.\n\nFrom above, after turn 35 at (5,3), I can go to (4,3) turn 36, (3,3) turn 37, (2,3) turn 38 to eat.\n\nTurn 38 <= 31+7=38, since life span 7 on turn 31: countdown 7 on turn 31, turn 32:6, ..., turn 37:1, turn 38:0 disappear. So can eat on turn 37 or 38? On turn 37 countdown=1, can eat, disappears after turn 37? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn 31: countdown=7, after turn 31: countdown=6, ..., after turn 37: countdown=0, disappear. So must be eaten by turn 37 inclusive.\n\nTurn 37: countdown=1, if eaten, ok.\n\nTurn 38: gone.\n\nIn the path, on turn 38 I move to (2,3), which is turn 38, but it might be gone.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nTurn 31: start\n\nIf move right: turn 31: to (6,6)\n\nTurn 32: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 33: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 34: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 35: to (5,3) eat (5,3)\n\nNow turn 35, head at (5,3)\n\nTurn 36: move left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: move left to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: move left to (2,3) but (2,3) might be gone? On turn 37, countdown for (2,3): life span 7, turn 31:7, turn32:6, ..., turn37:1, so on turn 37, it is still there, countdown=1, can be eaten on turn 37.\n\nBut on turn 37, I am at (3,3), not at (2,3).\n\nTo eat on turn 37, I need to be at (2,3) on turn 37.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 35, I can move left to (4,3) on turn 36, then to (3,3) on turn 37, but (2,3) is adjacent, so on turn 37 at (3,3), I can move down to (3,2) or left to (2,3)? (3,3) to (2,3) is left.\n\nYes, move to (2,3) on turn 37 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, in both paths.\n\nSo back to turn 31 decision.\n\nMoving right to eat (6,6) gives one more point without significant risk.\n\nMoving down directly might save time but miss one food.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating more is better.\n\nMoreover, the food at (6,6) has short life, only 4 turns, so better to eat it while I can.\n\n(2,3) has longer life.\n\nSo I think moving right is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction right, so moving right is allowed.\n\nThen after that, as above.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions starting from current turn.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to decide the first action, and plan ahead.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a sequence based on the plan.\n\nSince the state may change, but for now, with the information.\n\nAnother thing: in the move to (6,6), when I eat, the head moves to (6,6), which was food, but is there any issue?\n\nAlso, the body: after moving, the body includes (5,6), which is fine.\n\nNow, the food at (1,1) is gone, irrelevant.\n\nSo for turn 31, I think move right to (6,6).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut since the output should include actions, let's define a sequence.\n\nTurn 31: move R to (6,6) eat food\n\nTurn 32: move D to (6,5) no eat\n\nTurn 33: move L to (5,5) no eat? From (6,5) to (5,5) is left.\n\nThen turn 34: move D to (5,4) no eat\n\nTurn 35: move D to (5,3) eat food\n\nThen beyond, but 5 turns from turn 31: turns 31 to 35.\n\nTurn 31,32,33,34,35: that's 5 actions.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 33, from (6,5) to (5,5), direction left.\n\nThen on turn 34, from (5,5) to (5,4), down.\n\nCurrent direction after turn 33 is left, moving down, which is not reverse, allowed.\n\nThen to (5,3) down.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (2,3), but not in 5 turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved down first on turn 31, sequence: turn 31 D to (5,5), turn 32 D to (5,4), turn 33 D to (5,3) eat, then turn 34 L to (4,3), turn 35 L to (3,3), then turn 36 to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut in this case, I missed (6,6).\n\nSo better to include (6,6).\n\nPerhaps I can move to (6,6) and then directly down to reach (5,3) faster, but in the sequence above, it's similar.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not in the way.\n\nAlso, the tail danger: not applicable here.\n\nSo I think moving right is fine.\n\nTherefore, for turn 31: move R.\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 31: R (to eat (6,6))\n\nTurn 32: D (only choice to (6,5))\n\nTurn 33: L (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 34: D (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 35: D (to (5,3) eat)\n\nThat should work.\n\nOn turn 33, from (6,5), I could move down to (6,4) instead of left, but moving left gets me towards the other food.\n\nSimilarly, after (5,3), I can go left.\n\nBut for the output, since it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\", I need to specify the actions.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions.\n\nSo for now, I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead. The current state (turn 31) has the snake head at (5,6) moving right. Key considerations:\n- **Food analysis**: \n  - (1,1) has life span 1 and must be eaten on turn 31 to be collected, but it is too far (9+ moves away) and impossible to reach. Ignore.\n  - (6,6) has life span 4 (available until turn 34) and value +1. It is adjacent to the head and can be eaten immediately by moving right.\n  - (2,3) has life span 7 (available until turn 37) and value +1. It can be targeted later after maneuvering.\n  - (5,3) has life span 10 (available until turn 40) and value +1. It is reachable in 2-3 turns from the current position.\n- **Movement options at turn 31**:\n  - Up: (5,7) is a wall (y=7 border), invalid.\n  - Down: (5,5) is free and safe.\n  - Right: (6,6) has food and is free; eating it grows the snake to length 11.\n  - Left: Opposite to current direction (right), invalid.\n- **Risk assessment**: \n  - Moving right to (6,6) eats food immediately but forces a down move next turn (only safe exit). This is acceptable as it gains a point and positions the snake to access (5,3) efficiently.\n  - Moving down to (5,5) avoids immediate risk but misses the (6,6) food, which may become inaccessible due to its short life span and the snake's path.\n- **Long-term plan**: \n  - Eat (6,6) on turn 31 for +1 score.\n  - Move down to (6,5) on turn 32 (only safe move).\n  - Move left to (5,5) on turn 33 to start pathing toward (5,3).\n  - Move down to (5,4) on turn 34.\n  - Move down to (5,3) on turn 35 to eat food (+1 score).\n  - Beyond turn 35, target (2,3) by moving left (e.g., to (4,3) on turn 36, (3,3) on turn 37, and (2,3) on turn 37 or 38).\n\nThis sequence eats two foods by turn 35, maximizing score with minimal risk. The snake grows to length 12 after turn 35, but the grid has space for further movement. Avoiding (6,6) risks losing it permanently, reducing potential score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 31: R (right)  \nTurn 32: D (down)  \nTurn 33: L (left)  \nTurn 34: D (down)  \nTurn 35: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. But x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the snake can be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Let me list the snake positions to verify.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)]\n\nHead is at (6,6), and it's moving right, so direction R. Since it's moving right, from (6,6) to... wait, positions are head first, so from (6,6) to (5,6) which is left, but direction is R? That doesn't make sense.\n\nCurrent head direction is given as R, but the positions: head (6,6), then (5,6) which is left of head, so if head was moving right to (6,6), but (6,6) to (5,6) is left, so the direction might be the current moving direction or the last direction?\n\nThe state says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", which I think is the direction the head is facing or the last movement direction. Since it just moved to (6,6) from where? Positions: index 0 is head (6,6), index 1 is (5,6), so the head moved from (5,6) to (6,6) by moving right? But (5,6) to (6,6) is right, so from position 1 to 0, head is at (6,6) which is east of (5,6), so it moved right to get there. But the next segment is (5,6), then (4,6), etc., so the tail is at (4,4).\n\nThe direction given is R, which matches moving right to (6,6).\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1)\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the current state.\n\nGrid: 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7), but walls on borders, so snake can only be on (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nSnake positions: head (6,6), then body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). So 11 segments.\n\nLet me list the coordinates:\n\n- Head: (6,6)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,6)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 5: (1,6)\n\n- Segment 6: (1,5)  // turned down\n\n- Segment 7: (1,4)  // down\n\n- Segment 8: (2,4)  // right, from (1,4) to (2,4)\n\n- Segment 9: (3,4)  // right\n\n- Segment 10: (4,4)  // right, tail\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the top row y=6 from x=6 to x=1, then down to y=5 and y=4 at x=1, then right to (2,4), (3,4), (4,4).\n\nHead at (6,6), direction right, so it can move up, down, right? But no instant reverse, so since it moved right to (6,6), it cannot move left (opposite) to (5,6) because that would be reverse. Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so last move was right. Therefore, it cannot move left immediately, because that's opposite. So possible moves: U, D, R. But R to (7,6)? x=7 is wall, so cannot move right. x=7 is wall, so moving right to (7,6) is invalid, collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving up: (6,7) but y=7 is wall, so (6,7) is out of bounds, wall collision.\n\nMoving down: (6,5), which is within bounds? y=5, x=6.\n\nGrid: y=0 bottom? Or top? Typically in coordinates, y=0 might be bottom or top, but here it doesn't specify, but walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom or top? Since snake is at y=6, and moving, but let's see the positions.\n\nIn positions, (1,6) to (1,5) to (1,4), so y decreasing from 6 to 5 to 4, so y=6 is higher, y=4 is lower? Or vice versa? The movement: U (x,y+1) should increase y, so if U is up, y+1 might be north, assuming y=0 is south.\n\nBut in the state, it doesn't specify coordinate system, but from movements, U (x,y+1) probably means increasing y is up, decreasing y is down.\n\nIn positions, from (1,6) to (1,5) to (1,4), y decreasing, so if y=6 to y=5, it moved down, so y=6 is higher row, y=5 lower, so y=0 should be bottom, y=7 top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall? But in positions, (1,6) is near top, since y=7 is wall.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y=6 is just below it. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right wall.\n\nSo for head at (6,6):\n\n- Move U (up) to (6,7): but y=7 is wall, collision, invalid.\n\n- Move D (down) to (6,5): this is free? Let's see if occupied.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nSo (6,5) is not occupied, no food there? Food is at (2,3) and (5,3), so (6,5) is empty.\n\n- Move R (right) to (7,6): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Move L (left) to (5,6): but (5,6) is occupied by body segment, and since it's not the tail, it would collide. Also, L is opposite to current direction R, so it cannot move left anyway because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves: only D down to (6,5) is valid? U and R are walls, L is reverse and also occupied.\n\nSo only one choice: move down to (6,5).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, food is available.\n\nCurrent turn t1=32.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,3) life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 32, life span 7, so it will be there for 7 more turns? Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 32, life span 7, after turn 32 it becomes 6, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 32 + 7 - 1 = 38? Let's see.\n\nIf life span N at turn t, it decreases every turn, so after k turns, life span is N - k, and it disappears when life span becomes 0, so at turn t + N, it is gone. For example, turn t, life N, after turn t, at start of turn t+1, life is N-1, ..., at start of turn t+N, life=0, food gone.\n\nBut it can be eaten during turn when it has life span >=1.\n\nAt turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten if life span >0 at that turn.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think this means that when we are at turn t, the life span is given, and after the turn, it decreases by one.\n\nBut for eating, during turn t, if head moves to food, and life span >0, it is eaten.\n\nThen after eating, life span decreases for the next turn, but since it's eaten, it's gone.\n\nIn this case, at turn 32, life span for (2,3) is 7, so it can be eaten from turn 32 to 38? At turn 32, life span 7, after turn 32, it becomes 6 for turn 33, and so on, up to turn 38: at start of turn 38, life span = 7 - (38-32) = 7-6=1, so it can be eaten on turn 38, and after that, at turn 39, life span 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) life span 9, from turn 32 to turn 32+9-1=40? Turn 32: life 9, turn 33: life 8, ..., turn 40: life 9 - (40-32) = 9-8=1, so eaten on turn 40, gone on turn 41.\n\nNow, back to current move. Head at (6,6), direction R, only possible move is down to (6,5), since up and right are walls, left is reverse and occupied.\n\nBut is (6,5) safe? Yes, empty cell.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), the snake will have new head position, and tail moves, so the segment at (4,4) will be the new tail? Let's simulate one move.\n\nCurrent positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)]\n\nIf move down to (6,5), new head is (6,5), then body segments: the first body segment is now (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and tail (4,4) is removed? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nNo food eaten, so length same, tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nTail was (4,4), removed, and new tail is (3,4)? Positions: after move, head to (6,5), then the segment that was at index 1 (5,6) moves to where head was (6,6)? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions list: new head at (6,5), then the old head (6,6) becomes the first body segment, then old (5,6) becomes second body, and so on, up to old (3,4), and old tail (4,4) is removed.\n\nList of positions: index 0: head (6,6), index 1: (5,6), index 2: (4,6), ..., index 10: (4,4)\n\nAfter move down: new head at (6,5), then new index 1: old index 0 (6,6), new index 2: old index 1 (5,6), new index 3: old index 2 (4,6), ..., new index 10: old index 9 (3,4), and old index 10 (4,4) is gone.\n\nOld positions: 11 segments.\n\nAfter move: head to (6,5), then body: positions 1 to 10 of old become positions 2 to 11? Better to think: the new body segments are the old positions from 0 to 9, but shifted.\n\nNew positions: [ (6,5) , (6,6) , (5,6) , (4,6) , (3,6) , (2,6) , (1,6) , (1,5) , (1,4) , (2,4) , (3,4) ]\n\nYes, and tail is now (3,4), whereas before it was (4,4).\n\nNow, head direction: it moved down, so new direction is D.\n\nNow, from (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse: last move was D (down), so cannot move U (up), because opposite.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D (down to (6,4)), L (left to (5,5)), R (right to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid).\n\nSo possible moves: D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nNow, check if occupied.\n\nCurrent positions after move: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)\n\n(6,4) is not in list, empty? But is there food? Food at (2,3) and (5,3), not here.\n\n(5,5) not in list, empty.\n\nBoth seem possible.\n\nBut I need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood at (2,3) and (5,3), both positive.\n\n(5,3) is closer? Head at (6,5) after first move.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), head at (6,5).\n\nTo reach (5,3), which is left and down, or to (2,3) further left.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant yet.\n\nFirst, for turn t1=32, I must move down to (6,5), as only choice.\n\nThen for turn 33, I need to choose from (6,5): can move D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf I move L to (5,5), then head to (5,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse: last move L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nPossible: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5).\n\nBut (5,6) is occupied? After previous move, positions: if we moved to (5,5) on turn 33.\n\nLet's simulate step by step.\n\nTurn 32: move D to (6,5)\n\nNew positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nDirection: D\n\nTurn 33: from (6,5), direction D, so can move D or L (since U reverse, R wall)\n\nOption A: Move D to (6,4)\n\nThen new head (6,4), body: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)] but tail (3,4) removed? No, head to (6,4), so new positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] tail (2,4)\n\nDirection D\n\nThen from (6,4), can move D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) invalid.\n\n(6,3) is empty? Not in positions.\n\n(5,4) not in positions.\n\nFood at (5,3) is below, at y=3.\n\n(6,3) is one step down.\n\nIf move to (6,3), then closer to (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), so from (6,3) to (5,3) is left.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is at (2,3).\n\nBack to turn 33 option.\n\nOption B for turn 33: move L to (5,5)\n\nThen new head (5,5), body: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] and tail (3,4) removed? Old positions had (3,4) as last, but after move, new positions: head (5,5), then old head (6,5), then old (6,6), (5,6), ..., up to old (2,4), and old (3,4) removed.\n\nList: new [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] tail (2,4)\n\nDirection L (since moved left)\n\nFrom (5,5), direction L, can move U, D, L (since R reverse)\n\nU to (5,6): (5,6) is in body, occupied, collision.\n\nD to (5,4): empty? Not in positions.\n\nL to (4,5): empty? Not in positions.\n\nR to (6,5) but reverse, invalid.\n\nSo can move D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n\n(5,4) is below, (4,5) left.\n\nFood at (5,3) is south of (5,4), so moving to (5,4) gets closer.\n\n(2,3) is west.\n\nNow, life span: (2,3) life 7 at turn 32, so at turn 33, life span 6, etc.\n\nSimilarly (5,3) life 9 at 32, turn 33 life 8.\n\nBoth can be eaten in time.\n\nBut I need to consider the path and risks.\n\nAlso, the snake body is long, so need to avoid trapping itself.\n\nCurrent position after turn 32 move: head at (6,5), body at (6,6), (5,6), etc.\n\nThe area around: for example, moving to (6,4) might be safer, as it's moving down away from the body.\n\nMoving to (5,5) is into a area with body above at (5,6) and left at (4,6)? (4,6) is body, but (5,5) is free.\n\nBut from (5,5), if I move down to (5,4), that seems good.\n\nLet's think about the food at (5,3).\n\nFrom (6,5), if I move down to (6,4) on turn 33, then at (6,4), I can move down to (6,3) on turn 34, then from (6,3) to (5,3) on turn 35 to eat the food at (5,3).\n\nTurn 32: move D to (6,5) - must do\n\nTurn 33: move D to (6,4)\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) tail (2,4)\n\nDirection D\n\nTurn 34: from (6,4), direction D, can move D to (6,3), L to (5,4), or R invalid.\n\nMove D to (6,3)\n\nNew head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail (2,4) removed, new tail (1,4)\n\nPositions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nDirection D\n\nTurn 35: from (6,3), can move L to (5,3), D to (6,2), R invalid? x=7 wall, U to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, occupied.\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R invalid.\n\n(6,2) is within bounds? y=2, x=6, walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so y=2 ok.\n\n(5,3) is food.\n\nIf move to (5,3), eat food, value +1, length increases.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (5,3), and tail does not move, so positions: head (5,3), then the body is the old positions but tail not removed, so new segment added.\n\nOld positions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), new head (5,3), then body: old head (6,3) becomes first body, then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), ..., up to (1,4), and no removal, so length 12 now.\n\nPositions: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nDirection L (since moved left from (6,3) to (5,3))\n\nNow, from here, the snake has a long body, and head at (5,3).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse: last move L, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso, U to (5,4): (5,4) not occupied? In positions, (1,5) and (1,4), but (5,4) is free? Not in list.\n\nD to (5,2): free.\n\nL to (4,3): free.\n\nR to (6,3) but reverse, invalid.\n\nAlso, (5,4) might be free; let's list occupied: from positions, (5,3) head, (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) so (5,4) not occupied, similarly (5,2), (4,3) etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is above, (5,2) below, (4,3) left.\n\nNow, the other food at (2,3) is at same y, x=2.\n\nBut life span: at turn 35, (2,3) life span: started turn 32 with 7, turn 33:6, turn 34:5, turn 35:4, so still available.\n\n(5,3) eaten on turn 35.\n\nBut we have to think from turn 32.\n\nAnother path: from turn 33, instead of moving down, move left to (5,5).\n\nTurn 32: move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 33: move L to (5,5)\n\nNew positions: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] tail (2,4)\n\nDirection L\n\nTurn 34: from (5,5), can move D to (5,4), L to (4,5), or U invalid (reverse?

Only two, both positive.\n\nBut I need to think beyond eating both, for survival.\n\nAfter eating both, the snake is longer, and I need to find space to move without colliding.\n\nCurrently, after eating both, head at (2,3), body to (1,6), etc.\n\nThe grid has walls and obstacle.\n\nFree cells: for example, the bottom rows y=1,2,3 might have space.\n\ny=4 has (1,4), (2,4) body, but (2,4) might move.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nGrid 1 to 6 in x and y.\n\nBody positions: after eating both, but let's not get ahead.\n\nPerhaps both paths are ok, but I should consider if one is riskier.\n\nIn the first path, when I move to (6,4) on turn 33, then to (6,3) on 34, both times moving down.\n\nThen to (5,3) on 35.\n\nBut when at (6,3), moving to (5,3), it's left, but the cell (5,3) was free, no problem.\n\nIn the second path, moving to (5,5) on turn 33, then (5,4) on 34, then (5,3) on 35.\n\nAt turn 33, if I move to (5,5), I have body at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,5) is surrounded on three sides, but I can move down or left.\n\nThen moving down to (5,4), which is free.\n\nBut from (5,4), to (5,3) down, fine.\n\nBut after that, when I go left to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), at (3,3), the cell (3,6) is body, but not adjacent.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (3,1), which is below, but not blocking.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) might be under something? But it's not under snake, since snake positions don't have (2,3), it's free.\n\nIn the state, food at (2,3) and (5,3), not under snake.\n\n\"Food can spawn under the snake's body\" but here not, so can be eaten normally.\n\nNow for turn 33 choice.\n\nBut I need to output actions from turn 32 onwards for a few turns.\n\nThe answer should be actions for turn t1=32, t1+1=33, t1+2=34, etc., but how many? Probably until I have a plan or for 5 turns.\n\nThe user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably a few, like 5 or so.\n\nIn the boxed answer, it should be Turn 32: action, Turn 33: action, etc.\n\nBut for turn 32, only one choice: D down.\n\nThen for turn 33, I can choose D or L.\n\nIf I choose D to (6,4), then turn 34 to (6,3), turn 35 to (5,3) to eat.\n\nIf I choose L to (5,5) on turn 33, then turn 34 to (5,4), turn 35 to (5,3) eat.\n\nThen after that, I can go to (2,3).\n\nBut let's see which is better for long-term.\n\nIn the first choice, after eating (5,3) at (5,3), the body is going up to (6,3) to (6,6), then left to (5,6), etc., so the area to the left is open.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, in second choice, same.\n\nBut in the first path, when I am at (6,3) on turn 34, I have body at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), so the row y=6 is occupied, but I move left to (5,3), so not issue.\n\nIn second path, at (5,5) on turn 33, I have body at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,5) has neighbors: (5,6) body, (6,5) body, so only down and left are free, which I take.\n\nBut moving down to (5,4) is fine.\n\nNow, for the other food (2,3), it has shorter life span, 7 vs 9, so I should eat it first? But (5,3) is closer to current position.\n\nAt turn 32, head at (6,5), (5,3) is at distance |6-5| + |5-3| =1+2=3, (2,3) is |6-2| + |5-3| =4+2=6, so (5,3) closer.\n\nLife span (2,3) shorter, but I can reach both in time.\n\nIf I go directly to (2,3), it might be farther.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), to go to (2,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut with body, it might be tight.\n\nFor instance, if I move left to (5,5) on turn 33, then left to (4,5) on turn 34, then down to (4,4) or something, but (4,4) was tail, but moving.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSince (5,3) is on the way, better to eat (5,3) first.\n\nThen go to (2,3).\n\nNow, back to turn 33 choice.\n\nI think both are ok, but let's see if one has lower risk.\n\nIn the move to (6,4) on turn 33, I am moving down, away from the body cluster.\n\nIn move to (5,5), I am moving into the area with body above and right.\n\nBut since I can move down, it should be fine.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after eating both foods, I need to find a path to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after head at (2,3), I can move down to (2,2), (2,1), etc., or left, but x=1 is wall? x=1 not wall, walls x=0 and x=7.\n\nx=0 wall, so x=1 is ok.\n\nBut at (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) are body, so left side might be blocked.\n\nSimilarly, bottom y=1.\n\nBut after moving, the tail moves, so cells free up.\n\nFor instance, when I go to (2,3) on turn 38, tail is at (1,6), which will move as I move.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move to (2,3) on turn 38, the tail was at (1,6) on turn 37, but after eating, tail not moved, so it stays.\n\nIn the path to (2,3), on turn 38 I move to (2,3), eat, so tail not removed, so positions include from (2,3) to (1,6), so cells like (1,3) might be free.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2), since (2,4) is body? Positions after eating (2,3): [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ]\n\nSo (2,2) free, (1,3) free, (3,2) free, etc.\n\nI can move down to (2,2), then (2,1), etc.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so I need to avoid that.\n\nBut y=1 is not wall, y=0 wall.\n\nSo I can go to (2,1), (1,1), etc.\n\nBut let's not detail.\n\nFor the immediate choice, I think moving down to (6,4) on turn 33 might be slightly better because it keeps me away from the body cluster at (5,6), (6,6), etc.\n\nBut moving to (5,5) is also fine.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,3) can be eaten on turn 35 in both cases.\n\nBut in the first case, when I go to (6,3) on turn 34, I am at (6,3), and food at (5,3) is adjacent, so I can eat on turn 35.\n\nSimilarly in second case.\n\nBut at (6,3), if I move to (5,3), it's fine.\n\nBut is there a risk of tail or something? No.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": only if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is far.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI think for turn 33, I can choose either, but let's pick one.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (5,3) directly.\n\nSince I have to output, for turn 32, only D.\n\nThen for turn 33, let's say D to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 34 to (6,3), turn 35 to (5,3).\n\nBut I need to output actions, not positions.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nBut the state is at turn 32, so I should output from turn 32.\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nThen turn 33: ? I need to decide.\n\nSince both are similar, I'll go with moving down to (6,4) on turn 33.\n\nThen turn 34 to (6,3), turn 35 to (5,3).\n\nThen after that, to (4,3) on turn 36, (3,3) on turn 37, (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nBut for the output, I can list up to say turn 35 or 36.\n\nThe user said \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 32 to 36.\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 34: D (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 35: L (to (5,3))\n\nThen turn 36: L (to (4,3))\n\nBut on turn 35, when moving to (5,3), it is eating, but the action is L.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the second choice, turn 33: L to (5,5), turn 34: D to (5,4), turn 35: D to (5,3), then turn 36: L to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 34, moving to (5,4), then turn 35 to (5,3).\n\nBut at (5,4), it is one step from food.\n\nNow, to be consistent, I'll go with the first plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 32: D (down)\n\nTurn 33: D (down) to (6,4)\n\nTurn 34: D (down) to (6,3)\n\nTurn 35: L (left) to (5,3) eat\n\nThen turn 36: L (left) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: L (left) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: L (left) to (2,3) eat\n\nBut for output, I think for 4 or 5 turns is fine.\n\nSince the food at (2,3) life until turn 38, and I eat on 38, it's ok.\n\nBut for the answer format, I should list actions for turn 32,33,34,35,36 for example.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle at (3,1), it doesn't affect the path to (3,3) or (2,3).\n\n(3,3) to (2,3) is left, not down.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAlso, walls are borders.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,3) on turn 34, is (6,3) safe? Yes.\n\nThen to (5,3) on 35.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 34, positions: at turn 34, after moving to (6,3), positions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] tail (1,4)\n\nThen turn 35 move L to (5,3), which is not occupied, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nFor turn 33, if I move L to (5,5), on turn 34 to (5,4), then (5,3), same thing.\n\nBut moving down might be better to avoid the body.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with:\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nThen for turn 36, to (4,3), action L.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nSince at turn 35, after eating (5,3), head at (5,3), I can go to (4,3) on turn 36 with L.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo plan 5 turns: turn 32 to 36.\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nTurn 36: L (to (4,3))\n\nThen turn 37: L to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I think up to turn 36 is ok.\n\nNow, write in boxed.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves 5+ turns ahead. The key priorities are:\n- **Immediate constraint**: At turn 32, the snake head is at (6,6) with direction right. Only moving down (D) to (6,5) is possible, as up (to wall) and right (to wall) are invalid, and left is both an instant reverse and a body collision.\n- **Food targeting**: Both foods are positive. (5,3) is closer (Manhattan distance 3 from (6,5) after turn 32) and has a longer life span (9 turns), while (2,3) is farther (distance 6) and has a shorter life span (7 turns). Eating (5,3) first is efficient and allows time to reach (2,3) by turn 38.\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - Moving down on turn 33 to (6,4) avoids the dense body area around (5,6)-(6,6) and provides a clear path to (5,3).\n  - The path to (5,3) via (6,4) and (6,3) minimizes collision risks, as these cells are unoccupied.\n  - After eating (5,3), moving left toward (2,3) is safe, with ample time (life span of (2,3) allows eating by turn 38).\n  - \"Tail Reward Danger\" is irrelevant here, as the tail is never adjacent to the head during food consumption.\n- **5+ turn plan**: \n  - **Turns 32-35**: Focus on reaching and eating (5,3) by turn 35.\n  - **Turns 36-38**: Move left to eat (2,3) by turn 38, utilizing the remaining life span.\n  - **Beyond turn 38**: After eating both foods, the snake can navigate downward (e.g., to y=1-2) to avoid dead ends, leveraging the internal obstacle at (3,1) not blocking the path.\n\nThe planned moves for turns 32-36 are safe and optimal, with (5,3) eaten on turn 35 and (2,3) on turn 38. Actions are chosen to avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reverses.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 33: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 34: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 35: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 36: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 33. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (3,1) which is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,5), then body segments: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So the tail is at (3,4).\n\nHead direction is D, which is down. That means the snake is moving downward, so from (6,5), moving down would go to (6,4), but let's see the positions: head is at (6,5), and previous position is (6,6), so yes, it was moving down to (6,5), so current direction is down.\n\nNow, food: there are two food items:\n\n- At (2,3) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- At (5,3) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize. Grid is 7x7? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (6,5)\n\n- Body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)  // tail at (3,4)\n\nList of positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nSo the snake has 11 segments.\n\nNow, food at (2,3) and (5,3), both at y=3.\n\nCurrent head direction is down, so from (6,5), moving down would go to (6,4). But is (6,4) occupied? Let's see the positions: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) are part of the body, but (6,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, other directions: up to (6,6), but (6,6) is the second segment, so it's occupied by body. Left to (5,5), which might be free? Right to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nx=7 is wall, so moving right from (6,5) to (7,5) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (6,4): y=4, which is within bounds, and not a wall.\n\nMoving left to (5,5): x=5, y=5, not listed in positions, and not wall, so should be free.\n\nMoving up to (6,6): occupied by body, collision.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,5) with direction D:\n\n- Down: to (6,4) - seems free\n\n- Left: to (5,5) - free\n\n- Right: to (7,5) - wall, invalid\n\n- Up: to (6,6) - body, invalid\n\nAlso, since direction is D, I cannot instantly reverse to up, which is not possible anyway.\n\nSo only possible moves: Down or Left.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFood: (2,3) and (5,3), both at y=3.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3, which is below (5,6), etc.\n\nThe snake is currently at (6,5), with body around.\n\nI should consider paths to the food.\n\nFirst, food at (5,3): from (6,5), I can go left to (5,5), then down to (5,4), then down to (5,3). That's two moves down after left.\n\nFrom (6,5) down to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then down to (5,3)? (5,4) to (5,3) is down.\n\nBut let's see if cells are free.\n\n(6,4): not occupied, as per positions.\n\n(5,4): is it occupied? Positions: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) are occupied, but (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is food, not body.\n\nBut when I move, the body also moves.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,3), it's farther.\n\nAlso, life span: food at (2,3) has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 33, so food at (2,3) will disappear after turn 33 + 5? Let's see.\n\nLife span: it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo for (2,3), life span 6 at turn 33. After turn 33, it decreases to 5, then to 4,3,2,1,0. After turn 38 (33+5), it should be gone? Turn 33: life span 6, after turn 33, it has 5 left? Or at the start of turn 33, life span is 6, and decreases at the end of the turn?\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\"\n\nI think it's: at the beginning of turn, if life span is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nTo be precise: the food is present for N turns from when it spawned, but here we have current life span.\n\nIn the state, it's given as life span remaining.\n\nFor food at (2,3), life span 6 at turn 33. That means it can be eaten on turns 33,34,35,36,37,38? But after being eaten or at turn end.\n\nTypically, the life span decreases after each turn, so at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present until after turn t + L - 1 or something.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span L. After each turn, the countdown decreases by 1. So after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it's safer to assume that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears after this turn, so not available on next turn.\n\nSimilarly, for eating: when the head moves to the food cell, it is eaten at that turn.\n\nSo for (2,3) at turn 33, life span 6: it can be eaten on turns 33 to 38, but after turn 38, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 38.\n\nTurn 33: life span 6, after turn 33, life span 5 (if not eaten)\n\nTurn 34: life span 5, after turn 34, life span 4, and so on, down to turn 38: life span 1, after turn 38, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on any turn from 33 to 38 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3), life span 8, so can be eaten from turn 33 to 40.\n\nBoth have value 1, positive.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (6,5) with direction D: down to (6,4) or left to (5,5).\n\nI should evaluate both options.\n\nOption 1: Move Down to (6,4) on turn 33.\n\nThen, from (6,4), direction now D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: down to (6,3), left to (5,4), right invalid (x=7), up to (6,5) but (6,5) is now the previous position, but after moving to (6,4), the body segments move: head to (6,4), then the first body segment to old head (6,5), and so on, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move down to (6,4), new positions: head (6,4), then body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) — but since no food eaten, length same, so tail at (3,4) moves away? Let's see: the last segment is (3,4), when snake moves, the tail moves to the next position? No.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed from its position.\n\nSo from positions: before move: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nAfter move down to (6,4): head to (6,4), then body segments: the first body segment moves to old head position (6,5), second to (6,6), third to (5,6), ..., and the last segment (3,4) is removed, so new positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] and tail is (2,4).\n\nThe snake had 11 segments, after move, still 11? No: when moving without eating, the snake moves forward, so the tail is cut off.\n\nNumber of segments: 11 positions, after move, head to new position, each body segment shifts to the previous one, so the last position is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (6,4), then the previous head (6,5) becomes first body, (6,6) second body, (5,6) third, ..., down to (1,5) becomes the 10th body? Let's list indices.\n\nOriginal positions index 0: head (6,5), 1: (6,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (1,6), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (3,4)  // 11 segments.\n\nAfter move down to (6,4): new head at (6,4). Then new body: segment 0 moves to where head was? Standard: the new body segments are the old positions except the tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [new head (6,4)] + [old positions 0 to 9], but old position 0 is (6,5), which is now first body, old position 1 (6,6) second body, ..., old position 9 (2,4) is now the last body, and old position 10 (3,4) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]  // 11 segments? (2,4) was position 9, now it's the tail.\n\nOld position 9 was (2,4), which is now the 10th segment, and tail.\n\nBut (3,4) was removed, so cell (3,4) is now free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is head.\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves:\n\n- Down to (6,3): y=3, which is within 1-6, not wall, and not occupied? Positions: (2,4) is body, but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- Left to (5,4): not occupied, free.\n\n- Right to (7,4): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Up to (6,5): but (6,5) is now the first body segment, so occupied, collision.\n\nAlso, direction is D, so cannot reverse to up anyway.\n\nSo possible: down or left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,3), then from there, I can go to (5,3) which has food, but (5,3) is food, not body.\n\n(5,3) is the food position.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can go left to (5,3) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,4), if I go left to (5,4), then from (5,4) I can go down to (5,3) to eat.\n\nNow, back to turn 33 decision.\n\nOption 1: move down to (6,4) on turn 33.\n\nThen on turn 34, I can go down to (6,3) or left to (5,4).\n\nIf I go down to (6,3) on turn 34, then on turn 35, I can go left to (5,3) to eat the food at (5,3).\n\nEating on turn 35.\n\nSimilarly, if from (6,4) I go left to (5,4) on turn 34, then down to (5,3) on turn 35 to eat.\n\nEither way, I can reach (5,3) by turn 35.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (2,3)? It has shorter life span, only 6, so must be eaten by turn 38.\n\nBut (2,3) is farther, and I need to go there.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider going for (5,3).\n\nIf I eat on turn 35, as above.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom current (6,5), if I go left to (5,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction now L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: left to (4,5)? x=4, y=5, not occupied? Positions: after move, let's see.\n\nIf turn 33 move left to (5,5), new positions: head to (5,5), body: old head (6,5) to first body, then (6,6), (5,6), ..., and tail removed, similar to before.\n\nNew positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]  // tail at (2,4)\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (5,6): but (5,6) is now the third body segment? Positions: (6,5) is first body, (6,6) second, (5,6) third, so (5,6) occupied, collision.\n\n- Down to (5,4): free, not occupied.\n\n- Left to (4,5): free? Not occupied.\n\n- Right to (6,5): but (6,5) is first body, occupied, collision.\n\nAlso, direction is L, so cannot reverse to right.\n\nSo possible: down to (5,4) or left to (4,5).\n\nIf I go down to (5,4) on turn 34, then to (5,3) on turn 35 to eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr from (5,5) go left to (4,5) on turn 34, then I need to go down to (4,4) or something, but not directly to food.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), so from (4,5) I can go down to (4,4), then left to (3,4) or something, but (3,4) might be occupied later.\n\nBut it's less direct.\n\nSo for reaching (5,3) quickly, moving down or left from (6,5) both can lead to eating by turn 35.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3.\n\nCurrently, the snake body is around there: positions include (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), etc.\n\n(2,4) is occupied, and (2,3) is below it, but (2,3) has food.\n\nTo eat (2,3), I need to move the head to (2,3) when it's free.\n\nBut currently, (2,3) is not occupied by body, only food.\n\nBut to access it, since the body is nearby, I need to approach carefully.\n\nFor example, from current position, if I want to go to (2,3), it's far: from (6,5) to (2,3), difference in x is -4, y is -2, so at least 6 moves, but with obstacles.\n\nPossible path: left to (5,5), then left to (4,5), left to (3,5), but (3,5) might be free? But there is internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,5) should be free.\n\nThen from (3,5) down to (3,4), but (3,4) is currently the tail, but after moves, it changes.\n\nAlso, (3,4) is occupied now, but when the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the tail reward danger.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, if the tail has food on it, and head is adjacent, if I eat that food, the tail grows, so the new tail is where the old tail was, and head moves there, so they collide immediately.\n\nIn this case, for (2,3), is there food on tail? Tail is at (3,4), no food there. Food is at (2,3), which is adjacent? (2,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,3) and (3,4) are diagonal, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells: for (2,3), adjacent are (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is currently occupied by body, and it's not the tail; tail is (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is tail, adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,5), (4,4), (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is body, not free.\n\nBut (2,3) is food, not adjacent to tail (3,4).\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut when I approach (2,3), I need to see if the tail is nearby.\n\nNow, life span of (2,3) is 6, so I have until turn 38 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) has life span 8, so more time.\n\nBut I should try to eat both if possible.\n\nFirst, let's plan to eat (5,3) quickly, then go for (2,3).\n\nFrom turn 33: move to (6,4) or (5,5).\n\nSay I move down to (6,4) on turn 33.\n\nThen turn 34: from (6,4), I can go down to (6,3) or left to (5,4).\n\nIf I go down to (6,3) on turn 34, then turn 35: from (6,3), I can go left to (5,3) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added.\n\nSo on turn 35, if head moves to (5,3) which has food, it eats, so new positions: head at (5,3), the previous positions of body are kept, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, head moves to food, body remains, so tail stays, and new segment is added at the tail position? Actually, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nFor example, before move to food, positions: say at turn 34 end, positions after move to (6,3) or something.\n\nAssume turn 33: move down to (6,4), positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 34: move down to (6,3), no food, so new positions: head to (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail at (1,4), (2,4) removed.\n\nOriginal tail was (2,4), removed.\n\nNow positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nTurn 35: move left to (5,3), which has food. So eat, head to (5,3), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so new segment added. Positions: head (5,3), then body: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // and a new segment at the old tail position? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to new cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was or something.\n\nStandard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food, the body follows, but the last segment (tail) stays, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes first body, and so on, down to the previous tail position, and since no tail removed, the snake has one more segment.\n\nFor example, before move to eat, positions: let's say at turn 34 end, head at (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), ..., (1,4)\n\nWhen move to (5,3) and eat, new head at (5,3), then the previous head (6,3) becomes first body, (6,4) second, ..., up to (1,4) which is now the second last body, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was? But the tail was at (1,4), so new segment at (1,4)? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nTypically: when the snake eats, it grows, so after moving, the tail is not removed; the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but since eating, the tail stays, so the new tail is the old tail.\n\nPositions: suppose before move, positions P = [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where Bk is tail.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell N without eating: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B{k-1}], tail B{k-1}.\n\nWith eating: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk], so tail is Bk, same as before, but now Bk is part of body, and snake has one more segment.\n\nIn this case, the cell Bk is still occupied, but no new cell is added; the snake occupies the new cell N, and all previous cells except the tail cell is vacated only if not eaten, but when eaten, tail cell remains occupied.\n\nIn terms of grid, when moving without eating, head vacates old position to move, tail vacates its position.\n\nWith eating, head vacates old position to move, tail does not vacate, so the position remains occupied, and new head position occupied.\n\nIn this scenario, for turn 35: before move, head at (6,3), body at (6,4) to (1,4), tail at (1,4).\n\nMove to (5,3), which is food, so eat. New head at (5,3), then the body segments: first body at old head (6,3), second at old first body (6,4), ..., and the tail remains at (1,4), so new positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]  // 12 segments, tail at (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is still occupied.\n\nNow, the food at (2,3) is still there.\n\nNow, I need to go to (2,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), then to (3,3), then to (2,3), but (3,3) might be free, etc.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,3) should be ok.\n\nAlso, life span of (2,3) is decreasing.\n\nTurn 33: life span 6\n\nTurn 34: after turn 33, if not eaten, life span 5\n\nTurn 35: after turn 34, life span 4, etc.\n\nAt turn 35, after eating (5,3), life span of (2,3) is 4? Let's track.\n\nTurn 33: start, food (2,3) life span 6\n\nAfter turn 33, if not eaten, life span 5\n\nAfter turn 34, if not eaten, life span 4\n\nAfter turn 35, if not eaten, life span 3\n\nSo at turn 36, it has life span 3, meaning it can be eaten on turn 36,37,38.\n\nI can reach (2,3) from (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), after eating, head at (5,3), direction L (since moved left from (6,3)).\n\nPossible moves: left to (4,3), down to (5,2), up to (5,4), right to (6,3) but (6,3) is now first body, occupied.\n\nDirection L, so cannot reverse to right.\n\nSo possible: left, down, up.\n\n(5,4) is above; in positions, (6,4) is body, but (5,4) not listed, so free? After eating at turn 35, positions include (6,3), (6,4), etc., so (5,4) is not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) free, (5,2) free, but y=2, within bounds.\n\nTo go to (2,3), I should go left to (4,3) on turn 36.\n\nThen from (4,3) to (3,3) on turn 37, then to (2,3) on turn 38.\n\n(2,3) has life span, at turn 38: if eaten on turn 38, it should be ok, since life span decreases after turn, so on turn 38, it has life span 1? Let's see life span.\n\nTurn 33: life span 6\n\nAfter turn 33: 5\n\nAfter turn 34: 4\n\nAfter turn 35: 3\n\nAfter turn 36: 2\n\nAfter turn 37: 1\n\nAfter turn 38: 0, disappears\n\nSo at turn 38, before action, life span is 1, so I can eat it on turn 38.\n\nIf I eat on turn 38, it's fine.\n\nNow, from (4,3) to (3,3) to (2,3).\n\nBut is (3,3) accessible? (3,3) is not wall, and should be free.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,3) is fine.\n\nAlso, when moving to (2,3), I need to ensure it's not occupied by body at that time.\n\nCurrently, at turn 35, body includes (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), etc.\n\nAs snake moves, positions change.\n\nFor example, after turn 35, positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nTurn 36: move left to (4,3), no food there, so move without eating.\n\nNew head (4,3), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., up to (1,5), tail at (1,4)? Let's see: old positions, head was (5,3), first body (6,3), second (6,4), ..., last body (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,3) no eat: new head (4,3), then body: old head (5,3), old first body (6,3), ..., old second last body (1,5), and tail (1,4) removed.\n\nOld positions indices: 0: (5,3), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (2,6), 9: (1,6), 10: (1,5), 11: (1,4)  // 12 segments\n\nAfter move to (4,3) no eat: new head (4,3), then body: old 0 (5,3), old 1 (6,3), old 2 (6,4), ..., old 10 (1,5), and old 11 (1,4) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]  // tail at (1,5)\n\n(1,4) vacated.\n\nTurn 37: move from (4,3) to (3,3), assuming no food, so move without eat.\n\nNew head (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., (1,6), tail (1,5) removed? Old tail (1,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]  // tail at (1,6)\n\nTurn 38: move to (2,3), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew head (2,3), body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (2,6), and since eat, tail not removed, so new segment added at old tail position? New positions: head (2,3), then old head (3,3) first body, (4,3) second, ..., up to (1,6) which is now part of body, and a new segment at the position where tail was, but tail was (1,6), so new segment at (1,6)? That would mean (1,6) still occupied, and head at (2,3).\n\nPositions: new head (2,3), then the previous positions: before move, positions were [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nAfter move to (2,3) with eat: new head (2,3), then body: old head (3,3), old first body (4,3), ..., old last body (1,6), so positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]  // 13 segments, tail at (1,6)\n\nAnd food eaten.\n\nThis seems possible.\n\nBut I need to check if during this path, there are collisions.\n\nFor example, when moving to (3,3) on turn 37, is (3,3) free? At that time, before move, positions include (3,6), but not (3,3), so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is food, not body.\n\nAlso, the tail was at (1,6), not near (2,3).\n\nNow, but in this plan, I ate both foods: (5,3) on turn 35 and (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nTurn 33: move down to (6,4)\n\nTurn 34: move down to (6,3)\n\nTurn 35: move left to (5,3) eat\n\nTurn 36: move left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: move left to (3,3)  // from (4,3) to (3,3) is left, direction L\n\nFrom (4,3), moving left to (3,3), yes.\n\nThen turn 38: move left to (2,3) eat.\n\nBut from (3,3) to (2,3) is left, same direction.\n\nNow, is there a problem with the internal obstacle? (3,1) is wall, but (3,3) is fine.\n\nAlso, borders: all within bounds.\n\nBut what about the initial move: I chose to go down on turn 33.\n\nI could have gone left to (5,5) on turn 33, then similar path.\n\nBut let's see if going left first is better or worse.\n\nIf turn 33 move left to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 34: from (5,5) move down to (5,4)\n\nTurn 35: move down to (5,3) eat\n\nSame as before, eat on turn 35.\n\nThen same as above to go to (2,3).\n\nBut from (5,3), to go to (2,3), I need to go left multiple times.\n\nIn the first plan, from (5,3) I went left to (4,3), etc.\n\nIf I start by going left on turn 33, I end up at (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), same position on turn 35.\n\nNo difference.\n\nBut in the first plan with down first, on turn 34 I was at (6,3), then to (5,3).\n\nBut in terms of the path to (2,3), it's similar.\n\nNow, but I need to consider if there are risks or dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: the body positions might block the way.\n\nFor example, when I go to (3,3) on turn 37, in the positions, before move, at turn 36 end, I have positions: after turn 36 move to (4,3) no eat, positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // tail at (1,5)\n\nThen turn 37: move to (3,3), which is left from (4,3), so (3,3) should be free.\n\nThen turn 38: to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is adjacent to (2,4)? But (2,4) is not in positions; at that time, positions have (2,6), but not (2,4), so (2,3) should be accessible.\n\nIn positions, (2,6) is there, but (2,3) is different cell.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut is there a risk of colliding with body?\n\nFor example, when moving to (3,3), the cell (3,3) might be free, but let's confirm the body cells.\n\nAt turn 36 end: cells occupied: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nSo (3,3) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) not occupied.\n\nNow, but when I move to (2,3) on turn 38, the head moves there, and if there was body, but no.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but tail is at (1,5) or (1,6), not near (2,3).\n\n(2,3) adjacent cells: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4)\n\n(2,4) might be free or not; at turn 38, before move, positions: after turn 37 move to (3,3) no eat.\n\nAfter turn 37: head to (3,3), body: old head (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), ..., up to (1,6), tail removed? Old tail (1,5) removed.\n\nPositions after turn 37: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  // tail at (1,6)\n\n(1,5) vacated.\n\nThen turn 38: move to (2,3), which is left from (3,3)? (3,3) to (2,3) is left, same x, y decrease? Coordinates: (3,3) to (2,3) is decreasing x, so left if facing that way.\n\nDirection: after moving to (3,3) from (4,3) by left, so direction L.\n\nThen moving left to (2,3) is fine.\n\nNow, (2,3) is food, eat.\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4)\n\n(3,3) is head position? No, head is moving to (2,3), so before move, (2,3) is food, not occupied.\n\nAfter move, head at (2,3).\n\nIs the tail adjacent? Tail is at (1,6), which is not adjacent to (2,3). (1,6) and (2,3) are not adjacent; distance is |dx=1, dy=3|, not adjacent.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nThus, this plan seems safe.\n\nNow, but I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns.\n\nThe answer should be from turn 33 to turn 33+4 or more? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and answer format shows Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nt1=33, so I need to provide actions for turn 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and possibly more, but at least 5 turns: 33 to 37 or 33 to 38.\n\nIn the plan above, I have up to turn 38.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn this plan, I assumed moving down on turn 33.\n\nBut what about the other option of moving left on turn 33?\n\nIf I move left to (5,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen turn 34: move down to (5,4)\n\nTurn 35: move down to (5,3) eat\n\nSame as before.\n\nThen turn 36: move left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: move left to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: move left to (2,3) eat\n\nAlmost identical.\n\nThe only difference is the path on turns 33 and 34.\n\nIn one case, turn 33 down to (6,4), turn 34 down to (6,3), turn 35 left to (5,3)\n\nIn other, turn 33 left to (5,5), turn 34 down to (5,4), turn 35 down to (5,3)\n\nThen same after.\n\nIn terms of risk, both seem similar.\n\nBut in the first path, when I go to (6,3) on turn 34, what is around there.\n\n(6,3) is near the border, but x=6, y=3, walls at x=7, but not immediate issue.\n\nAlso, body: after move to (6,3), positions include (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), so the column x=6 has body, but (6,3) is head, so moving left is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, from (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3), also fine.\n\nBut in the first path, when I move down to (6,4) on turn 33, then to (6,3) on turn 34, I am closer to the bottom, but y=3, grid y from 1 to 6, so y=3 is not bottom.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6, y=3 is middle.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut there might be a problem with the food at (2,3) being blocked or something.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but it doesn't affect the path to (2,3) or (3,3).\n\nBut in the plan, I go to (3,3) then to (2,3).\n\n(3,3) should be accessible.\n\nPerhaps I can consider going directly or other paths.\n\nBut both foods can be eaten safely.\n\nIs there a reason to prefer one over the other?\n\nSuppose I go for (2,3) first, since it has shorter life span.\n\nFrom current position (6,5), to (2,3).\n\nPossible path: turn 33 move left to (5,5)\n\nTurn 34 move left to (4,5)\n\nTurn 35 move down to (4,4)? But not directly to (2,3).\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,4) down, then to (4,3), then to (3,3), to (2,3).\n\nBut longer.\n\nTurn 33 left to (5,5)\n\nTurn 34 left to (4,5)\n\nTurn 35 left to (3,5)  // (3,5) should be free? Not occupied.\n\nThen turn 36 down to (3,4) but (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 35, if I move to (3,5), let's see positions.\n\nTurn 33: move left to (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]  // after move, tail removed.\n\nOriginal tail (3,4) removed, so (3,4) free? Old positions had (3,4), but removed.\n\nAfter turn 33: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)  // tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 34: move left to (4,5), no eat, new head (4,5), body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail (2,4) removed? Old tail (2,4) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nTurn 35: move to (3,5), which is left from (4,5), so (3,5) should be free.\n\nNew head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), ..., (1,5), tail (1,4) removed? Old tail (1,4) removed.\n\nPositions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nNow, from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) on turn 36.\n\n(3,4) is free? Not occupied.\n\nThen from (3,4) to (2,4) or directly to (2,3)? (2,3) is below (2,4).\n\n(3,4) to (2,4) left, then to (2,3) down.\n\nBut (2,4) might be occupied later? Not necessarily.\n\nTurn 36: from (3,5) down to (3,4), no eat? (3,4) has no food, so move.\n\nNew head (3,4), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (1,6), tail (1,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nTurn 37: from (3,4) to (2,4) left? (2,4) is free? Not occupied.\n\nBut (2,4) is not food, food is at (2,3).\n\nSo move left to (2,4), no eat.\n\nNew head (2,4), body: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), ..., (2,6), tail (1,6) removed.\n\nPositions: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]\n\nTurn 38: move down to (2,3), which has food, eat.\n\nNew head (2,3), body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), ..., (3,6), (2,6), and since eat, tail not removed, so positions include all, with new segment.\n\nBut here, on turn 38, I eat (2,3), but I haven't eaten (5,3) yet.\n\n(5,3) has longer life span, but in this case, I ate (2,3) first, but (5,3) is still there.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), I can go back to (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) has life span 8, so until turn 40.\n\nAt turn 38, after eating (2,3), positions: head at (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), and since eat, the tail (2,6) remains, so new positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]  // 12 segments? Let's count: head and 11 body, but after eating, one more, so 13? Before move, at turn 37 end, positions had 11 segments: head (2,4) and body down to (2,6), but (2,6) is last.\n\nBefore turn 38 move, positions: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]  // 11 segments, head (2,4), tail (2,6)\n\nMove to (2,3) eat: new head (2,3), then body: old head (2,4), old first body (3,4), ..., old last body (2,6), so positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]  // 12 segments, tail at (2,6)\n\nNow, to go to (5,3), which is at (5,3), I need to move from (2,3) to (5,3).\n\nPossible: right to (3,3), then to (4,3), to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) should be free.\n\nTurn 39: move right to (3,3) from (2,3), direction now? After moving to (2,3) from (2,4) by down? From (2,4) to (2,3) is down, so direction D.\n\nThen from (2,3) move right to (3,3), which is possible.\n\nThen to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) has life span: at turn 33 life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 33: 7\n\nAfter turn 34: 6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 38: 8 - (38-33) = 5? Turns: after each turn decreases.\n\nTurn 33: start, life span 8\n\nAfter turn 33: 7\n\nAfter turn 34: 6\n\nAfter turn 35: 5\n\nAfter turn 36: 4\n\nAfter turn 37: 3\n\nAfter turn 38: 2\n\nAfter turn 39: 1\n\nAfter turn 40: 0, disappear\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 39 or 40.\n\nOn turn 39, from (2,3) move right to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 40: move right to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 41: move right to (5,3) eat.\n\nBut on turn 41, life span: after turn 40, it becomes 0, so before turn 40 action, life span is 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 39 start, life span is 2 (after turn 38 decrease).\n\nAfter turn 39, decreases to 1.\n\nAt turn 40 start, life span 1, after turn 40, decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo if I eat on turn 40, it should be ok.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 40, I can move to (5,3) only if I am at (4,3) on turn 39.\n\nIn the above, turn 39: move to (3,3)\n\nTurn 40: move to (4,3)? No, to (5,3) directly? From (3,3) to (4,3) right, then to (5,3) right.\n\nBut on turn 40, I can be at (4,3), not (5,3).\n\nTurn 39: from (2,3) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 40: from (3,3) to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 41: to (5,3), but after turn 40, food disappears, so cannot eat on turn 41.\n\nMistake.\n\nTo eat on turn 40, I need to be at (4,3) on turn 39, then move to (5,3) on turn 40.\n\nBut on turn 39, I am at (2,3), move to (3,3), not to (4,3).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (4,3) in one move? No, adjacent only.\n\nSo I need two moves: to (3,3) then to (4,3), but (4,3) on turn 40? Turn 39 to (3,3), turn 40 to (4,3), then turn 41 to (5,3) too late.\n\nCannot reach (5,3) by turn 40 from (2,3) after turn 38.\n\nDistance: from (2,3) to (5,3) is dx=3, so at least 3 moves: turn 39 to (3,3), turn 40 to (4,3), turn 41 to (5,3), but turn 41 is after turn 40, food gone.\n\nThus, if I eat (2,3) first on turn 38, I cannot reach (5,3) in time to eat it before it disappears on turn 40.\n\nLife span allows eating on turn 40, but I can only be at (5,3) on turn 41 at earliest, which is after.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (5,3) first, then (2,3), as in the initial plan.\n\nIn the first plan, I eat (5,3) on turn 35, then (2,3) on turn 38, both within life span.\n\n(5,3) eaten on 35, life span until 40, fine.\n\n(2,3) on 38, fine.\n\nSo the first plan is better.\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to specify.\n\nIn the first plan, with turn 33 down.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 33: D (down)\n\nTurn 34: D (down) to (6,3)\n\nTurn 35: L (left) to (5,3) eat\n\nThen turn 36: L (left) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: L (left) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: L (left) to (2,3) eat\n\nBut from turn 35 to 36, from (5,3) to (4,3) is left, direction L.\n\nThen to (3,3) left, same.\n\nTo (2,3) left.\n\nNow, after turn 38, I have eaten both, so I can continue, but the answer might not need all, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions: turn 33 to 37.\n\nBut turn 38 is also part of the plan.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 33 to 35 is 3 turns, then to 37 is 5 turns from 33.\n\nt1=33, turns: 33,34,35,36,37 — that's 5 turns.\n\nActions: 33:D, 34:D, 35:L, 36:L, 37:L\n\nThen for turn 38, it's additional.\n\nBut in the answer format, I can provide multiple.\n\nSince the food at (2,3) is eaten on 38, but for the actions, I can stop at 37, as thinking ahead.\n\nBut to be complete.\n\nIn turn 37, I move to (3,3), which is safe.\n\nThen to eat on 38, I move left.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide up to turn 37.\n\nNow, but in the move on turn 37, from (4,3) to (3,3), is there any risk?\n\nEarlier I thought no.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nAfter turn 35: head at (5,3), direction L (since moved left)\n\nTurn 36: move left to (4,3), so direction still L\n\nTurn 37: move left to (3,3), direction L\n\nAll fine.\n\nIf I had moved differently, but this seems ok.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle: at (3,1), but I am at (3,3), no issue.\n\nAlso, borders fine.\n\nTherefore, the actions should be:\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nTurn 36: L\n\nTurn 37: L\n\nAnd then turn 38: L to eat (2,3)\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"at least 5 turns\", I can provide 5 actions.\n\nIn the initial, I could move left on turn 33, but in that case, for example, turn 33 L to (5,5), turn 34 D to (5,4), turn 35 D to (5,3), then same as above.\n\nBut in the first moves, if I go left then down, on turn 34 I am at (5,4), which might be closer to the body or something, but not necessarily.\n\nIn terms of the path to (2,3), it's similar.\n\nBut in the down-first path, on turn 34 I am at (6,3), which is near the right border, but since I move left immediately, no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think both are acceptable, but I'll stick with down first.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the head direction: after each move, direction changes, but I don't need to output direction, only actions.\n\nSo for turn 33: from (6,5) with dir D, move D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 34: from (6,4) dir D, move D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 35: from (6,3) dir D, move L to (5,3) eat\n\nThen turn 36: from (5,3) dir L, move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: from (4,3) dir L, move L to (3,3)\n\nActions: D, D, L, L, L for turns 33 to 37.\n\nThen turn 38: L to (2,3) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 37.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\", and I eat both, but for the actions, I need to specify the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should include until the second eat, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: in the state, there might be no other food, so after eating both, I need to survive, but no immediate threat.\n\nFor example, after turn 37 at (3,3), I can go to (2,3) then to (1,3) or something, but I have to avoid walls and body.\n\nBut not part of the plan.\n\nSo I think providing 5 actions is fine.\n\nBut let's see if there is a shorter path or better.\n\nSuppose on turn 33, I move left to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 34, instead of down, I move left to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 35 down to (4,4)\n\nBut (4,4) not food, then I need to go to (4,3) or to (3,4), etc., but it takes more turns to reach food.\n\nFor example, to reach (5,3) later, but not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (2,3) might be similar.\n\nBut in the direct path, I can eat (5,3) by turn 35 in both cases.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, the plan is good.\n\nSo actions:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, the plan involves eating the food at (5,3) first due to its accessibility, followed by the food at (2,3) which has a shorter life span (must be eaten by turn 38). The snake starts at (6,5) with direction down. Moving down on turn 33 to (6,4) avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to reach (5,3) efficiently. Continuing down on turn 34 to (6,3) brings the snake adjacent to (5,3). On turn 35, moving left to (5,3) eats the first food, increasing the length. Then, moving left to (4,3) on turn 36 and to (3,3) on turn 37 sets up for eating (2,3) on turn 38. This path avoids collisions with walls, obstacles, and the body, and both foods are eaten within their life spans.\n\n- **Turn 33**: Move down (D) to (6,4) – positions the snake for efficient path to (5,3).\n- **Turn 34**: Move down (D) to (6,3) – brings head adjacent to (5,3).\n- **Turn 35**: Move left (L) to (5,3) – eats positive food (+1 score, length increases).\n- **Turn 36**: Move left (L) to (4,3) – moves toward (2,3) with no risk.\n- **Turn 37**: Move left (L) to (3,3) – final step before eating (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats both foods safely: (5,3) on turn 35 and (2,3) on turn 38. After turn 37, the snake is at (3,3), and moving left to (2,3) on turn 38 will eat the food without danger (tail is not adjacent, and no collision risks). The plan prioritizes survival by avoiding walls, obstacles, and body collisions throughout, and thinks 5+ turns ahead to maximize score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: D \\\\\nTurn 34: D \\\\\nTurn 35: L \\\\\nTurn 36: L \\\\\nTurn 37: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 34, and I'm playing as the snake AI. The grid has walls and one internal obstacle.\n\n**Grid Boundaries and Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to those cells. So playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid cells are from (0,0) to (7,7), but I can only occupy cells where x is between 1 and 6, and y between 1 and 6, except for internal obstacles. No: the walls occupy those cells, so I can't be on (0,y) or (7,y) for any y, or (x,0) or (x,7) for any x. So valid positions are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nAlso, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Snake head is at (6,4), and it's moving Down (D). So current direction is down.\n- Body segments: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)\n- Let's list all positions in order:\n  1. Head: (6,4)\n  2. Segment 2: (6,5)\n  3. Segment 3: (6,6)\n  4. Segment 4: (5,6)\n  5. Segment 5: (4,6)\n  6. Segment 6: (3,6)\n  7. Segment 7: (2,6)\n  8. Segment 8: (1,6)\n  9. Segment 9: (1,5)\n  10. Segment 10: (1,4)\n  11. Tail: (2,4)\n\nThe tail is at (2,4). The snake has 11 segments? Let's count: positions from head to tail: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). That's 11 positions, so length 11.\n\n**Food:**\n- Food at (2,3) with value 1, life span 5\n- Food at (5,3) with value 1, life span 7\n- Food at (2,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. But food at (2,6) is actually on the snake's body? Let's see: (2,6) is a body segment. It's segment 7 in the list above, position (2,6).\n\nFood can be under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. Also, for the food at (2,6), it's on the body, so it might be eatable if that part moves.\n\nBut life span: for (2,3), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns from now, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N, it lasts N turns, starting from this turn.\n\nCurrent turn is 34, so:\n- Food at (2,3): life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 34 + 4 = 38? Let's think: at turn 34, life span is 5. After turn 34, it decreases to 4; after turn 35, to 3; ... after turn 38, it should be gone? Turn 34: countdown 5, turn 35:4, turn 36:3, turn 37:2, turn 38:1, turn 39:0 and disappears? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nRe-reading: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span L, the food will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, countdown = L. After turn t, it becomes L-1. After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t + (L-1), it becomes 0, and disappears before or after that?\n\nTypically, it might be that at the start of turn t, countdown is C. After the turn, it decreases. But the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's safer to assume that for food with life_span L at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1, meaning it can be eaten on turns t to t + L - 1.\n\nFor example, L=5 at turn 34: can be eaten on turns 34,35,36,37,38. Disappears before turn 39.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3): life span 7, so turns 34 to 40.\n\n(2,6): life span 10, turns 34 to 43.\n\nBut (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes back, but since it's under the body, it might be tricky.\n\nNow, head is at (6,4), moving down. So from (6,4), moving down would go to (6,3), but y=3 is within 1-6? y=0 is wall, y=7 is wall, so y=3 is valid.\n\nCurrent position: head at (6,4), moving down.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is D (down), so I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nSo forbidden move: U.\n\nAllowed moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, moving D: to (6,3)\n\nMoving L: to (5,4)\n\nMoving R: to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, moving U is forbidden and also, if I consider, U to (6,5), but (6,5) is the second segment, so it's occupied, but since the tail will move, I can move to tail position only if I can avoid collision.\n\nGeneral rule: I can move to a cell that is not occupied by a wall or by a body segment except the tail, because the tail will move forward when I eat food or not.\n\nWhen I move, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away, so head can move to the previous tail position without collision. If I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so if head moves to a position that was tail, it might be ok if no other body, but specifically, if I eat food, length increases, so tail stays, and head moves to new position.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and I'm not eating, it's ok.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's safe, because tail moves away.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n\nAlso, if after moving, the head is at the same position as a body segment, collision.\n\nNow, for food under body: if food is under a body segment, and that segment moves away, and then head moves to that cell, it can be eaten.\n\nIn this case, food at (2,6) is under segment 7, I think.\n\nSnake positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)\n\nSo (2,6) is position of segment 7, which is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (2,4).\n\nFood at (2,6) is on that cell, so if segment moves away, and head comes, it can be eaten.\n\nBut currently, head is far.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- D: down to (6,3)\n\n- L: left to (5,4)\n\n- R: right to (7,4) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- U: up to (6,5) but (6,5) is the second segment, occupied, and also U is opposite to D, so forbidden by no instant reverse.\n\nSo only possible moves: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4)\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid mentally.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells (x,y) with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)\n\nTail at (2,4).\n\nFood: (2,3), (5,3), (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is occupied by body, so not directly accessible.\n\nNow, from (6,4), move options:\n\n1. Move D to (6,3)\n\n2. Move L to (5,4)\n\nIf I move D to (6,3), what happens?\n\nNew head position: (6,3)\n\nCurrent body: the tail will move? Since I didn't eat food, the tail moves away. Tail is at (2,4), so after move, the snake will have head at (6,3), then segments: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and tail was (2,4), but it moves, so the new tail is (1,4)? Let's see the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead, so tail position is vacated.\n\nSo after moving D:\n\n- Head was (6,4) -> (6,3)\n\n- Segment 2: was (6,5) -> moves to (6,4)  (previous head)\n\n- Segment 3: was (6,6) -> moves to (6,5)\n\n- Segment 4: was (5,6) -> moves to (6,6)\n\n- Segment 5: was (4,6) -> moves to (5,6)\n\n- Segment 6: was (3,6) -> moves to (4,6)\n\n- Segment 7: was (2,6) -> moves to (3,6)\n\n- Segment 8: was (1,6) -> moves to (2,6)\n\n- Segment 9: was (1,5) -> moves to (1,6)\n\n- Segment 10: was (1,4) -> moves to (1,5)\n\n- Tail was (2,4) -> but (2,4) is segment 11, which moves to where segment 10 was? Segment 10 was (1,4), so segment 11 moves to (1,4)? Positions:\n\nBefore move:\n\nIndex: 0: head (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (2,6), 7: (1,6), 8: (1,5), 9: (1,4), 10: (2,4)  // tail\n\nAfter move down (D), head to (6,3)\n\nThen:\n\n- New position 0: (6,3)  // head\n\n- Position 1: old pos 0: (6,4)\n\n- Position 2: old pos 1: (6,5)\n\n- Position 3: old pos 2: (6,6)\n\n- Position 4: old pos 3: (5,6)\n\n- Position 5: old pos 4: (4,6)\n\n- Position 6: old pos 5: (3,6)\n\n- Position 7: old pos 6: (2,6)\n\n- Position 8: old pos 7: (1,6)\n\n- Position 9: old pos 8: (1,5)\n\n- Position 10: old pos 9: (1,4)  // tail, since old tail (2,4) is gone, and position 9 moves to (1,4)\n\nOld tail was at (2,4), which is vacated, and segment 10 moves to where segment 9 was, but segment 9 was (1,4), so new segment 10 is (1,4), and tail is there.\n\nBut old segment 10 was (2,4), which is no longer part of snake.\n\nNow, food at (2,3) is at y=3, x=2. Head is now at (6,3), so not eating anything.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (5,4), head to (5,4), then body moves: segment 1 to (6,4), segment 2 to (6,5), etc., similar shift.\n\nBut in this case, moving L to (5,4), is (5,4) occupied? Currently, positions: (6,4) is head, (6,5) is body, (5,4) is not in positions, so free.\n\nPositions: all except head: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So (5,4) is not occupied, so safe to move.\n\nNow, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,3) which is closer to (6,4).\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nY from 0 to 7, but walls, so consider y=1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\nInternal wall at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (6,4), body down to (6,6), then left to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), then down to (1,6), then down to (1,5)? (1,6) to (1,5) is down, then (1,5) to (1,4) down, then (1,4) to (2,4) right? Positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), then (2,4). So from (1,4) to (2,4) is right, so tail at (2,4).\n\nFood: (2,3) which is below (2,4), since y=3 < y=4? y increases up or down? Direction: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in coordinates, U (x,y+1) means increasing y is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nBut walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y=1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo (2,3): x=2, y=3, which is above (2,4) since y=3 < y=4? y=4 is lower than y=3? Let's clarify coordinates.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n\nThen U: (x,y) to (x,y+1) - up\n\nD: to (x,y-1) - down\n\nL: to (x-1,y) - left\n\nR: to (x+1,y) - right\n\nSo y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nAt (x,y), y smaller is lower.\n\nFor example, (2,4) and (2,3): (2,3) is below (2,4) since y=3 < y=4.\n\ny=3 is lower row, y=4 is higher row.\n\nIn terms of position, (2,4) has higher y, so it's north of (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) head, (6,5) is north of it, since y=5>4.\n\nFood at (2,3): x=2, y=3\n\n(5,3): x=5, y=3\n\n(2,6): x=2, y=6\n\n(2,6) is occupied by snake body.\n\nNow, from head (6,4), moving D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I move D to (6,3), I am at (6,3), which is above the bottom wall, y=3, not wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go to food at (5,3) or others.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nFrom (6,3), possible moves: since I moved D, new direction is D, so cannot move U next.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R.\n\nD to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) invalid wall.\n\nSo from (6,3), I can move L to (5,3) to eat the food there, if I want.\n\nFood at (5,3) is positive, value +1, so eating it increases length by 1.\n\nIf I move to (5,3) from (6,3), that's moving left, so action L.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) now, from current position.\n\nLet's evaluate both options.\n\nFirst, move D to (6,3) now.\n\nTurn 34: move D to (6,3)\n\nThen snake positions: head (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail at (1,4)? After move, as before: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  and no (2,4) anymore.\n\nFood at (5,3) is at (5,3), which is adjacent to (6,3), left.\n\nSo on next turn, I can move L to (5,3) to eat it.\n\nBut let's see if that's safe.\n\nIf I eat at (5,3), then snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut I need to think about the area.\n\nThere is also food at (2,3) and (2,6), but (2,6) is on body.\n\nNow, after moving to (6,3), on turn 35, I can move to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen snake head at (5,3), and since I eat, length increases, so new tail is the old tail, which was at (1,4), and body extends.\n\nPositions after eating at (5,3) on turn 35:\n\n- Head at (5,3)\n\n- Then the previous positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // and since I ate, (1,4) is still tail, so 12 segments.\n\nThen from (5,3), direction is L (since moved left from (6,3)).\n\nThen I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move R (right) because that's opposite to L.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\nU to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3)\n\nBut (5,2): y=2, which is valid, not wall. y=2 between 1 and 6.\n\nBut (5,4) might be occupied? Current positions: after eating, positions include (6,3), (6,4), etc., so (5,4) is not in positions? Positions: (5,3) head, then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nSo (5,4) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) free, (5,2) free.\n\nBut y=2, and there is internal wall at (3,1), but (5,2) is fine.\n\nNow, moving to (5,3) might be good to get food, but let's see the risks.\n\nThere is food at (2,3), which is at (2,3), life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 38.\n\nCurrently turn 34, after move to (6,3) on 34, then to (5,3) on 35, eat food.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go to (2,3) to eat that food as well.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is left and same y.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move L to (4,3), then L to (3,3), then L to (2,3), but (3,3) to (2,3) is left.\n\nBut there is internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,3) is fine.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (2,3): need to move left three times.\n\nBut after moving to (5,3), direction L, so I can move L to (4,3).\n\nTurn 35: at (5,3), after eating.\n\nThen turn 36: from (5,3), move L to (4,3)\n\nNow positions: head (4,3), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., up to (1,4) but since I ate, tail at (1,4), and length 12.\n\nAfter move to (4,3), no eat, so tail moves? When I move to (4,3) from (5,3), I am not eating, so tail moves away.\n\nPrevious positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nAfter move L to (4,3):\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Then: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // and tail was (1,4), vacated, so new tail at (1,5)? Positions: segment after head: old head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), ..., (1,5), (1,4) but (1,4) is gone, so the last is (1,5), which is new tail.\n\nList: indices after turn 35 eat: 0: (5,3), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (2,6), 9: (1,6), 10: (1,5), 11: (1,4)  // 12 segments\n\nAfter move L to (4,3) on turn 36, no eat:\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\n- New pos1: old pos0: (5,3)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1: (6,3)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2: (6,4)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3: (6,5)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4: (6,6)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5: (5,6)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6: (4,6)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7: (3,6)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8: (2,6)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9: (1,6)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10: (1,5)  // tail, since old tail (1,4) gone\n\nSo tail at (1,5)\n\nNow from (4,3), direction L (since moved left), so cannot move R.\n\nCan move U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is free, (4,4) might be occupied? Positions: (4,3) head, (5,3), (6,3), etc., no (4,4), so free.\n\n(4,2) free.\n\nI can move to (3,3) then to (2,3) to eat food at (2,3).\n\nOn turn 37: from (4,3) move L to (3,3)\n\nThen on turn 38: move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nFood at (2,3) life span 5, turn 34 to 38, so on turn 38 it can be eaten, before disappearing.\n\nAfter eating at (2,3), snake longer.\n\nBut is there risk?\n\nAlso, there is the food at (2,6) on body.\n\nBut let's see the other move option.\n\nBack to turn 34, if I move L to (5,4) instead of D.\n\nTurn 34: move L to (5,4)\n\nThen new head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) but tail moves? No eat, so tail (2,4) vacates.\n\nAfter move L to (5,4):\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Then: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // and tail was (2,4) gone, so new tail at (1,4)\n\nPositions before: 0:(6,4), 1:(6,5), 2:(6,6), 3:(5,6), 4:(4,6), 5:(3,6), 6:(2,6), 7:(1,6), 8:(1,5), 9:(1,4), 10:(2,4)\n\nAfter move L to (5,4):\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- New pos1: old pos0: (6,4)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1: (6,5)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2: (6,6)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3: (5,6)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4: (4,6)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5: (3,6)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6: (2,6)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7: (1,6)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8: (1,5)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9: (1,4)  // tail, since old pos10 (2,4) gone\n\nSo tail at (1,4)\n\nFrom (5,4), direction L (moved left from (6,4)), so cannot move R.\n\nCan move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4)\n\n(5,3) has food, I can move down to eat it.\n\n(5,3) is food, so if I move D to (5,3), I eat it.\n\nTurn 34: move L to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 35: move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen snake grows, positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail at (1,4)\n\nLength 12.\n\nDirection now D (since moved down).\n\nCannot move U.\n\nCan move D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3)\n\n(6,3) might be free, but (6,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\nThen I can go towards (2,3) or other.\n\nBut (2,3) is at (2,3), life span short.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move L to (4,3), then to (3,3), to (2,3) to eat by turn 38.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nNow, comparing the two initial moves:\n\n- If I move D on turn 34 to (6,3), then L to (5,3) on 35 to eat, then to (4,3) on 36, to (3,3) on 37, to (2,3) on 38 to eat.\n\nBut on turn 38, I eat at (2,3), just in time.\n\n- If I move L on turn 34 to (5,4), then D to (5,3) on 35 to eat, then same as above to (2,3).\n\nIn both cases, I can get both foods: (5,3) and (2,3).\n\nBut in the first case, when I move D to (6,3), I don't eat on turn 34, I eat on turn 35.\n\nIn second case, I eat on turn 35 after moving to (5,3).\n\nBut turn 34 I don't eat in either case initially.\n\nIn first case, turn 34 move D to (6,3), no eat.\n\nTurn 35 move L to (5,3), eat.\n\nIn second case, turn 34 move L to (5,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 35 move D to (5,3), eat.\n\nSo similar, but the positions are different.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3) on 34, then to (5,3) on 35, head at (5,3).\n\nAfter moving to (5,4) on 34, then to (5,3) on 35, head at (5,3) same.\n\nBut the body is different.\n\nIn first case, when I was at (6,3) before moving to (5,3), the segment behind is (6,4).\n\nIn second case, when I move to (5,4) then to (5,3), the segment behind is (5,4).\n\nBut not a big difference.\n\nNow, about the food at (2,6). It's on the body at (2,6), which is segment 6 or 7, but it might move.\n\nFor example, in the sequence above, when I move towards (2,3), the body at (2,6) might move away.\n\nIn the first sequence, after turn 36, when I am at (4,3), positions include (2,6) but it might be moving.\n\nLet's see when (2,6) is vacated.\n\nInitially, (2,6) is occupied by snake.\n\nAs the snake moves, that position changes.\n\nFor example, if I go down to eat (5,3) and (2,3), the part at (2,6) will eventually move.\n\nBut the food at (2,6) has long life, span 10, so turns 34 to 43.\n\nBy the time I go to (2,3), it might still be there.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to have head go to (2,6) after the body moves away.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is part of body, and as snake moves, it will be vacated when that segment moves.\n\nFor example, in the body, (2,6) is a segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position.\n\nSpecifically, if the head moves, the segment at (2,6) will move to where the previous segment was, but it depends.\n\nIn the first sequence, after moving to (6,3) on 34, positions: (2,6) is still there, at position 7 or something.\n\nEarlier: after turn 34 move D to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nSo (2,6) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 35 move L to (5,3) and eat, positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\n(2,6) still occupied.\n\nAfter turn 36 move L to (4,3), no eat: positions head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // tail (1,5)\n\n(2,6) still occupied.\n\nAfter turn 37 move L to (3,3): head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  // and (1,5) moved to (1,6)? After move to (3,3):\n\n- Head (3,3)\n\n- New pos1: old head (4,3)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 (5,3)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 (6,3)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 (6,4)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 (6,5)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 (6,6)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 (5,6)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 (4,6)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8 (3,6)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9 (2,6)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10 (1,6)  // tail\n\nSo (2,6) is now at position 10, still occupied.\n\nThen turn 38 move L to (2,3) to eat: head to (2,3), eat food.\n\nSince eat, tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  // and old tail (1,6) stays, so (2,6) is still occupied, but now it's a body segment, not head.\n\n(2,6) has food, but it's under the body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n\nIn this case, (2,6) is occupied by the snake, so I cannot eat it yet.\n\nMoreover, after eating at (2,3), head is at (2,3), and (2,6) is at (2,6), which is three units north.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move up, but there is body above.\n\nPositions: from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3)\n\nBut (2,4): is it free? Current positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), etc., up to (1,6), but (2,4) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) might be free, (3,3) is occupied by the next segment.\n\n(3,3) is position 1, so occupied.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4): free? Positions: (2,3) head, (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\n(2,4) not in list, so free.\n\n- D to (2,2): free\n\n- L to (1,3): free? (1,3) not in list, walls: x=0 wall, so (1,3) is playable, not occupied.\n\n- R to (3,3): but (3,3) is position 1, occupied, so collision if move there.\n\nAlso, current direction after moving L to (2,3), so direction L, cannot move R.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\nNow, to eat food at (2,6), I need to go there when it's free.\n\nBut currently (2,6) is occupied, and as the snake moves, it will move.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (2,4), then to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,6) has life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut let's think about the other food.\n\nThere is also the internal obstacle at (3,1), which might block some paths.\n\nBut for now, back to the initial choice.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, currently, tail is at (2,4), and there is food at (2,3), which is adjacent to tail? (2,3) and (2,4) are adjacent vertically.\n\nHead is at (6,4), not adjacent to tail.\n\nBut if I go to (2,3), and tail is at, say, (1,4) or something, when I eat at (2,3), tail might not be adjacent.\n\nIn the sequence, when I eat at (2,3) on turn 38, tail is at (1,6), which is not adjacent to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) to (1,6) is not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly for other foods.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,6), it is on the body, and when the body moves away, it can be eaten.\n\nBut in the position after eating at (2,3), (2,6) is still occupied.\n\nTo vacate (2,6), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (2,6) moves.\n\nFor example, if I continue moving, eventually (2,6) will be vacated.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, let's consider the long-term survival.\n\nAnother point: the snake is quite long, 11 segments, and the grid is small, 6x6 playable area minus obstacle, so 36 cells minus walls and obstacle.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1-6, y=1-6, 36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so 35 cells available.\n\nSnake length 11, so 24 free cells.\n\nBut with food, etc.\n\nAfter eating two more foods, length 13, so less space.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, let's consider the move to (6,3) or (5,4) on turn 34.\n\nIf I move to (6,3), I am closer to the bottom, y=3, and I can go left to eat (5,3) and (2,3).\n\nIf I move to (5,4), I am at y=4, and I can go down to (5,3) to eat, then left.\n\nBut (5,4) is a bit higher.\n\nThere might be a risk at (6,3).\n\nFor example, from (6,3), if I move D to (6,2), but y=2, then I might be near the wall.\n\nBut not immediately dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, the internal obstacle at (3,1) might affect movements in the bottom left.\n\nBut since I am going to (2,3), which is above it.\n\n(2,3) y=3, (3,1) y=1, so not blocking directly.\n\nNow, another food at (2,6) with long life, I can get it later.\n\nBut let's see the head direction and possible traps.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so if I move D to (6,3), I continue down, direction D.\n\nThen I can move L to (5,3) to eat.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), I change to left direction.\n\nBut not a big issue.\n\nPerhaps moving D to (6,3) is better because it keeps me closer to the food at (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), from (6,4), moving D to (6,3) is one step away, then L to (5,3).\n\nMoving L to (5,4) then D to (5,3) is also one step away from food, but I go to (5,4) first.\n\nIn terms of turns to reach food, both are similar.\n\nBut moving to (6,3) might have a risk if I cannot move left or something, but I can.\n\nLet's think about the wall at x=7 and y=0.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), if I move D to (6,2), then I am at (6,2), which is corner, but I can move L or U.\n\nNot immediately trapped.\n\nSimilarly, after eating at (5,3), I am at (5,3), I can go to (2,3).\n\nBut to reach (2,3) from (5,3), I need to move left three times, which might be ok.\n\nBut the area between x=1 to 3, y=1 to 3 might be tight because of the obstacle at (3,1).\n\nFor example, (3,1) is blocked, so cells around it.\n\nBut (2,3) is at y=3, so I can access it from above or left.\n\nFrom (5,3), moving left to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), all are free.\n\n(3,3) is free, as per earlier.\n\nThen after eating at (2,3), I am at (2,3), and I can move U to (2,4), then to (2,5), then to (2,6) if food is still there and vacated.\n\nBut (2,6) is currently occupied and will be for some time.\n\nWhen will (2,6) be vacated?\n\nIn the snake body, (2,6) is a segment that moves when the head moves.\n\nAs the head moves left and down, the body will shift.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, after several moves, the segment at (2,6) will move to (3,6) or something.\n\nBut it's slow.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) has life span 10, it will be there until turn 43, so I have time to get it later.\n\nBut I need to plan the path to avoid blocking myself.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (1,4) or moving, and when I move, it moves.\n\nBut in the bottom left, there might be a dead end.\n\nFor example, around (1,1) to (2,2), with obstacle at (3,1), so if I go to (2,2), I might be trapped.\n\nBut in this case, I don't need to go there.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), which is free, then to (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,4) was the tail position earlier, but it moved.\n\nIn current state, tail at (2,4), but after moves, it changes.\n\nPerhaps for turn 34, both moves are ok, but let's choose one.\n\nI think moving D to (6,3) is fine, then I can eat (5,3) next.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (5,4) then D to (5,3) is also fine.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\".\n\nAlso, output for turns starting from t1=34.\n\nSo I need to output actions for turn 34, 35, 36, etc., for several turns.\n\nBut I don't have to specify all, but at least the immediate action and a plan.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so for 34,35,36,37,38 or more.\n\nBut I can plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can go for the two foods first.\n\nLet's plan a sequence with move D on 34.\n\nTurn 34: move D to (6,3)  // no eat\n\nThen turn 35: move L to (5,3)  // eat food at (5,3), length +1\n\nNow at (5,3), direction L\n\nTurn 36: move L to (4,3)  // no eat\n\nTurn 37: move L to (3,3)  // no eat\n\nTurn 38: move L to (2,3)  // eat food at (2,3), length +1\n\nNow at (2,3), direction L\n\nThen from here, I can consider going to (2,6) or other.\n\nBut (2,6) is still occupied, as per earlier calculation.\n\nAfter turn 38, positions: head at (2,3), body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  // since I ate at (2,3), tail is at (1,6)\n\n(2,6) is occupied by the body.\n\nTo vacate (2,6), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (2,6) moves.\n\nFor example, if I move U from (2,3) to (2,4), then the body will shift.\n\nTurn 39: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)  // direction U, no eat? (2,4) may not have food.\n\nThen positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) but (2,6) is position, and since no eat, tail moves.\n\nBefore move: head (2,3), positions: 0:(2,3), 1:(3,3), 2:(4,3), 3:(5,3), 4:(6,3), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,5), 7:(6,6), 8:(5,6), 9:(4,6), 10:(3,6), 11:(2,6), 12:(1,6)  // tail at (1,6)\n\nAfter move U to (2,4):\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- New pos1: old pos0: (2,3)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1: (3,3)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2: (4,3)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3: (5,3)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4: (6,3)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5: (6,4)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6: (6,5)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7: (6,6)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8: (5,6)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9: (4,6)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10: (3,6)\n\n- New pos12: old pos11: (2,6)  // tail, and old tail (1,6) gone\n\nSo now (2,6) is the tail position, and it has food? The food is at (2,6), and now the tail is at (2,6), but the food is under the tail.\n\nCan I eat it? The rule: food under body can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nHere, the tail is at (2,6) with food, and if I move the head to (2,6), but the tail will move if I don't eat, or stay if I eat.\n\nBut specifically, if the head is adjacent to the tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nIn this case, after turn 39, head at (2,4), tail at (2,6), are they adjacent? (2,4) and (2,6) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart vertically. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (2,4) and (2,5) would be adjacent, but (2,4) and (2,6) are not, since |dy|=2.\n\nSo not adjacent.\n\nBut the food is at (2,6), under the tail.\n\nIf I want to eat it, I need the tail to move away, then head to move there.\n\nBut when the tail moves, the food is revealed, and I can move head to it.\n\nFor example, if I move from (2,4) to (2,5), then tail at (2,6) will move if no eat.\n\nTurn 39: at (2,4), I can move U to (2,5), for example.\n\nThen after move, head at (2,5), tail at (2,6) moves? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions at turn 38 after eating: head (2,3), body as above.\n\nAfter turn 39 move U to (2,4): as above, head (2,4), tail at (2,6)\n\nNow, from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5) on turn 40.\n\nThen: move U to (2,5)\n\nNo eat, so tail moves.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  // tail (2,6)\n\nAfter move U to (2,5):\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- New pos1: old pos0: (2,4)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1: (2,3)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2: (3,3)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3: (4,3)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4: (5,3)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5: (6,3)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6: (6,4)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7: (6,5)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8: (6,6)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9: (5,6)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10: (4,6)\n\n- New pos12: old pos11: (3,6)  // tail, and old tail (2,6) vacated\n\nSo (2,6) is now vacated, and food is there.\n\nHead is at (2,5), which is adjacent to (2,6) below? (2,5) and (2,6): y=5 and y=6, since y=6 is south? Coordinates: (2,5) to (2,6) is down, since y increases north? U is (x,y+1) up, so higher y is north.\n\n(2,5) to (2,6) is U, up.\n\n(2,5) to (2,6) is moving up to higher y.\n\nBut (2,6) has the food now, and it's free.\n\nSo on turn 41, I can move U to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nBut when I move to (2,6), is the tail adjacent? Tail is at (3,6), which is not adjacent to (2,6); (2,6) and (3,6) are adjacent horizontally.\n\n(2,6) and (3,6) share a side, so adjacent.\n\nNow, if I move to (2,6), which has food, and the tail is at (3,6), which is adjacent, then according to Tail Reward Danger, if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but here the food is at (2,6), not at tail cell; tail cell is (3,6), which may not have food.\n\nThe rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n\nIn this case, when I move to (2,6), the tail is at (3,6), and (3,6) does not have food; the food is at (2,6), which is the head cell after move.\n\nSo no issue; I can eat it safely.\n\nAfter move to (2,6), I eat the food, so tail doesn't move, and I grow.\n\nPositions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo in this sequence, I can get all three foods.\n\nBut in the initial move, I had to choose between D and L on turn 34.\n\nIn this plan, I used move D on 34.\n\nIf I moved L on 34, similar, but I might not be able to get to (2,6) as easily, but possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span.\n\nFood at (2,6) life span 10, turn 34 to 43.\n\nIn the sequence, I eat on turn 41, which is within 43, ok.\n\nNow for turn 34, I think moving D to (6,3) is reasonable.\n\nBut is there a reason to move L to (5,4)?\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) on 34, then D to (5,3) on 35 to eat, then L to (4,3) on 36, L to (3,3) on 37, L to (2,3) on 38 to eat, same as before.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4) on 39, U to (2,5) on 40, U to (2,6) on 41 to eat, similar.\n\nBut when I move to (2,6) on 41, the tail might not be adjacent, but in this case, similar.\n\nSo both initial moves lead to similar outcome.\n\nBut in the first case, when I move D to (6,3) on 34, I am at (6,3), which is closer to the wall, but not critical.\n\nPerhaps moving L to (5,4) keeps me more central, but not necessary.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction D, if I move D, I continue, if I move L, I change.\n\nBut not important.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might affect if I go south, but I don't go to y=1 immediately.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I could move D to (2,2), but (2,2) might be near the obstacle.\n\n(3,1) blocked, so (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is free, and I can move there, but it might be a dead end if not careful.\n\nBut in this plan, I go up to (2,4), not down.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for turn 34, I can choose to move D.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L (to (5,3) eat)\n\nTurn 36: L (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 37: L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 38: L (to (2,3) eat)\n\nThen turn 39: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 40: U (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 41: U (to (2,6) eat)\n\nBut I need to output only for a few turns, or as per the answer format.\n\nThe instruction doesn't specify how many turns to output, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nTurn 34 to 38 is 5 turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, turns 34 to 38: D, L, L, L, L\n\nBut on turn 35 L to (5,3) eat, turn 38 L to (2,3) eat.\n\nThen for turn 39 and beyond, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output from turn 34 to, say, 38 or 41.\n\nSince the format is to box the actions, I'll output for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving D on 34 is safe.\n\nAnother risk: when I move to (6,3), is there any immediate danger?\n\n(6,3) is not wall, not occupied except by snake, but when I move, it was free.\n\nBefore move, positions have (6,4), (6,5), etc., but (6,3) not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (5,4) is safe.\n\nBut in moving to (6,3), I am at y=3, which is closer to bottom, but I can move away.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not going for (2,3) immediately if it's risky, but I think it's ok.\n\nAnother food at (5,3) is also available.\n\nSo I'll go with move D on turn 34.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nTurn 36: L\n\nTurn 37: L\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nBut on turn 35, moving L from (6,3) to (5,3) eats food.\n\nOn turn 38, moving L to (2,3) eats food.\n\nThen for turn 39, I can move U, etc.\n\nBut for the output, since it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\", I can list multiple.\n\nI think 5 turns is sufficient.\n\nTo be complete, I can list until turn 38.\n\nBut turn 38 is t1+4, since t1=34, t1+4=38.\n\nt1=34, turn 34: t1, turn 35: t1+1, ..., up to turn 38: t1+4.\n\n5 actions: 34 to 38.\n\nActions: D, L, L, L, L\n\nBut the directions need to be specified.\n\nIn the sequence, all L moves except first D.\n\nBut from (6,3) to (5,3) is L, then to (4,3) is L, to (3,3) is L, to (2,3) is L.\n\nAll left moves.\n\nBut the head direction changes, but since I keep moving left, no issue with reverse.\n\nAfter moving D to (6,3), direction is D, then I move L to (5,3), so new direction L.\n\nThen moving L again to (4,3), direction L, etc.\n\nAll fine.\n\nI think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The strategy prioritizes eating the positive food at (5,3) and (2,3) while avoiding risks, such as collisions or dead ends. The food at (2,6) has a longer life span (10 turns) and can be targeted later if feasible, but the immediate focus is on the more time-sensitive food at (2,3) (life span 5 turns, must be eaten by turn 38).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 34)**:\n  - Head at (6,4), direction Down (D).\n  - Possible moves: Down (D) to (6,3) or Left (L) to (5,4). Right (R) to (7,4) is invalid (wall), and Up (U) is forbidden (instant reverse).\n  - Moving D to (6,3) positions the snake closer to the food at (5,3) and sets up a path to (2,3) efficiently.\n- **Food Access**:\n  - (5,3) can be eaten on turn 35 by moving Left from (6,3).\n  - (2,3) must be eaten by turn 38; a direct leftward path from (5,3) to (2,3) over 3 turns is safe and efficient.\n  - (2,6) is currently under the body and cannot be eaten immediately; it will be vacated later and can be targeted after turn 38 if the path is clear.\n- **Collision Risks**:\n  - All moves avoid walls and body segments. Moving to the tail position is safe when the tail moves away (no eating).\n  - The path to (2,3) avoids the internal obstacle at (3,1) and does not enter potential dead ends (e.g., the bottom-left area near (3,1) is not needed).\n  - No tail reward danger: When eating at (2,3) on turn 38, the tail (at (1,6)) is not adjacent.\n- **Long-Term Survival**:\n  - After eating both foods, the snake length increases to 13, reducing free space. The sequence exits the congested left side by moving up toward (2,6) after turn 38, avoiding entrapment.\n  - If needed, the snake can navigate to open areas (e.g., center or right) after turn 41 for better mobility.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 34–38):\n1. **Turn 34: D (Down)**  \n   - Move to (6,3). This avoids the forbidden reverse (U) and positions the snake to eat (5,3) next. No food eaten; tail moves, vacating (2,4).\n\n2. **Turn 35: L (Left)**  \n   - Move to (5,3) and eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 12). Direction changes to Left. The path is collision-free (no body or walls).\n\n3. **Turn 36: L (Left)**  \n   - Move to (4,3). No food; tail moves. Direction remains Left.\n\n4. **Turn 37: L (Left)**  \n   - Move to (3,3). No food; tail moves. Direction remains Left.\n\n5. **Turn 38: L (Left)**  \n   - Move to (2,3) and eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 13). Eaten just before it disappears (life span 5 ends after turn 38). Direction changes to Left; tail at (1,6) is not adjacent, so no risk.\n\n### Beyond Turn 38:\n- **Turns 39–41 (if continuing)**:\n  - Turn 39: U (Up) to (2,4) – Move away from the bottom-left, no eat.\n  - Turn 40: U (Up) to (2,5) – Vacates (2,6) for food access.\n  - Turn 41: U (Up) to (2,6) – Eat the food (if still present; life span 10 allows it until turn 43). No tail reward danger (tail at (3,6) is adjacent but food is not on tail cell).\n\nThis sequence scores +2 immediately and sets up a safe path for further food collection. If (2,6) is unavailable, the snake can easily redirect to open areas (e.g., move Right from (2,3) or (2,4) after assessing risks).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 34\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38\\text{: L} }",

So, I should consider the grid as 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and one obstacle inside.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (6,3), and it's moving down (direction D). The body segments are: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4).

Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (2,3) with life span 4 on turn 35:\n\n- Turn 35: life span 4\n\n- Turn 36: life span 3\n\n- Turn 37: life span 2\n\n- Turn 38: life span 1\n\n- After turn 38, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) life span 6: lasts until turn 40 (35+5=40? Let's calculate:\n\nTurn 35: 6\n\n36:5\n\n37:4\n\n38:3\n\n39:2\n\n40:1\n\n41: gone? After N turns means after N decreases, so if life span N on turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nStandard way: if life span is L on turn T, it decreases each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So on the turn it reaches 0, it's still there but will be gone next turn? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at the start of turn T, food has life span L. After the turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, it can be eaten during the turn when life span >0.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify when it disappears relative to the turn. Let's assume that on turn T, if life span is L, it can be eaten if L >=1, and after the turn, L decreases. When L=1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (2,3): life span 4 on turn 35. So:\n\n- Turn 35: can be eaten, after turn, life span becomes 3\n\n- Turn 36: can be eaten, life span becomes 2\n\n- Turn 37: can be eaten, life span becomes 1\n\n- Turn 38: can be eaten, life span becomes 0, disappears after this turn\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(5,3) life span 6: lasts until turn 40 (turn 35:6, 36:5, 37:4, 38:3, 39:2, 40:1, 41:0 disappear)\n\n(2,6) life span 9: lasts longer.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,3), direction down. Current direction is D, so moving down.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on this turn. Possible moves: down, left, right.\n\nNow, let's see the grid. I should sketch a map.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (6,3)\n\nBody: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail at (1,4)\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is a food position, but (2,6) is also occupied by the snake body? Snake positions include (2,6) as the 8th segment? Let's list snake positions in order:\n\nIndex 0: head (6,3)\n\n1: (6,4)\n\n2: (6,5)\n\n3: (6,6)\n\n4: (5,6)\n\n5: (4,6)\n\n6: (3,6)\n\n7: (2,6)  // here is (2,6)\n\n8: (1,6)\n\n9: (1,5)\n\n10: (1,4)  // tail\n\nSo (2,6) is occupied by the snake body segment 7.\n\nBut food is at (2,6) with life span 9 and value 1.\n\nRule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for (2,6), it's under the body now. To eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,6), and then head moves to (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,3) and (5,3) are not under snake, I think. (2,3) is empty? Let's see occupied cells.\n\nSnake occupies: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nFood at (2,3), (5,3), (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is occupied by snake, so food is there but under body.\n\n(2,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n\n(5,3) not in snake, free.\n\nAlso, walls: borders and (3,1)\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: D (down to (6,2)), L (left to (5,3)), R (right to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid).\n\nx=7 is wall, so moving right to (7,3) is invalid.\n\nMoving down to (6,2): y=2, is it within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6? Cells: (x,y) with x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are playable, except obstacles.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=7 wall, x=0 wall, x=7 wall.\n\nSo (6,2): x=6 between 1 and 6? x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall. x from 1 to 6 inclusive, since x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly y from 1 to 6.\n\n(6,2): y=2, which is between 1 and 6, so valid, unless obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not (6,2).\n\nSo (6,2) is empty? Snake not there, no wall.\n\nSimilarly, left to (5,3): (5,3) is a food position, and not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (6,3) is head, (6,4), etc, no (5,3), so (5,3) is free except for food.\n\nFood is at (5,3), so moving left to (5,3) would eat the food, since head moves to it.\n\nSimilarly, down to (6,2) is empty, no food.\n\nRight to (7,3) is wall, invalid.\n\nUp is opposite direction, invalid.\n\nSo possible actions: D (down to (6,2)) or L (left to (5,3))\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nIf I move left to (5,3), I eat the food: +1 score, length increases by 1. So snake grows, new head at (5,3), and tail stays, so body adds one segment.\n\nAfter eating, the food is consumed, so removed.\n\nThen, new positions: head moves to (5,3), body: the previous head (6,3) becomes new body segment 1, then (6,4), (6,5), etc., and tail (1,4) remains, but since length increased, the tail doesn't move this turn? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move; you add a new segment at head.\n\nMovement: in each turn, snake moves one cell in direction, and if it eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move, new position added at head. If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nRule: for positive food, length +1, so when eaten, snake grows, tail stays.\n\nIn positions: when moving to a cell with food, head moves to that cell, and since food eaten, the body doesn't advance the tail; so the new body has the previous head position added, and tail remains.\n\nFor example, current positions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nIf move left to (5,3), which has food, so eat it. New head at (5,3). The body: (6,3) becomes segment 1, then (6,4), ..., up to (1,4) as segment 11? Original 11 segments.\n\nCurrent snake has 11 segments: positions list has 11 elements.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (5,3), then the previous head (6,3) is now body, so positions: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] so now 12 segments, tail at (1,4).\n\nAnd direction is now left, since moved left.\n\nIf move down to (6,2), no food, so head to (6,2), tail moves: tail (1,4) is removed, new positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] so tail now (1,5), and length same, 11 segments. Direction down.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nI need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves and consequences.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (5,3), eat food.\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction left.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: since direction left, cannot move right (opposite). Can move left (to (4,3)), down (to (5,2)), up (to (5,4)).\n\nNow, grid: (4,3) is empty? No food listed, and not snake or wall.\n\n(5,2) is empty, no food.\n\n(5,4): is it occupied? Snake has (6,4), but (5,4) is not in positions, so empty.\n\nAfter move, positions: if ate at (5,3), snake is at (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), etc.\n\nSo (5,4) is free.\n\nNow, food available: (2,3) and (2,6), but (2,6) is under body at (2,6).\n\nLife spans: (2,3) has life span 4, on turn 35, so after turn 35, it decreases to 3 on turn 36, and so on, lasts until turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) eaten, gone.\n\n(2,6) life span 9, so many turns left.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), on turn 36, head at (5,3), direction left.\n\nNow, from (5,3), I can move:\n\n- Left to (4,3): empty\n\n- Down to (5,2): empty\n\n- Up to (5,4): empty\n\nAll safe immediately.\n\nBut I need to consider getting other food and avoiding risks.\n\nThere is food at (2,3), which is close, but I need to navigate there.\n\nAlso, (2,6) but it's under body.\n\nNow, tail is at (1,4), and body includes (2,6) which has food under it.\n\nTo eat (2,6), I need the body to move away from (2,6), then head to move there.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is occupied by segment 7, which is not tail; tail is (1,4).\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail stays.\n\nSo to free (2,6), since it's not tail, it will move when the snake advances without eating.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat for several moves, the body will move, and (2,6) will be vacated when the segment there moves.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (2,6) is the 7th segment. When the snake moves without eating, each segment moves forward, so the segment at (2,6) will move to the next position when the segment before it moves.\n\nLet's think of the body as a chain.\n\nAfter turn 35, if I ate at (5,3), positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nSegment at (2,6) is position index 9? Let's index from head.\n\nAfter move: new positions: index 0: (5,3) head\n\n1: (6,3)\n\n2: (6,4)\n\n3: (6,5)\n\n4: (6,6)\n\n5: (5,6)\n\n6: (4,6)\n\n7: (3,6)\n\n8: (2,6)  // this is where food is\n\n9: (1,6)\n\n10: (1,5)\n\n11: (1,4) tail\n\n(2,6) is index 8.\n\nWhen the snake moves next without eating, the tail (1,4) moves away, but (2,6) is not tail; it will move only when the segments before it cause it to move.\n\nIn one move without eating, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n\nSo for example, on turn 36, if I move from (5,3) to say (4,3), no eat, then new head (4,3), body: position 1: (5,3), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,4), ..., up to the last body segment which was index 10: (1,5) becomes the new body, and tail (1,4) is removed.\n\nSo the segment that was at (2,6), index 8, will move to where index 7 was, which is (3,6)? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 35: positions: 0:(5,3), 1:(6,3), 2:(6,4), 3:(6,5), 4:(6,6), 5:(5,6), 6:(4,6), 7:(3,6), 8:(2,6), 9:(1,6), 10:(1,5), 11:(1,4)\n\nIf turn 36, move to (4,3) no eat, then new positions:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nThen body: 1: (5,3)  // previous head\n\n2: (6,3)  // previous index 1\n\n3: (6,4)  // previous index 2\n\n4: (6,5)  // previous index 3\n\n5: (6,6)  // previous index 4\n\n6: (5,6)  // previous index 5\n\n7: (4,6)  // previous index 6\n\n8: (3,6)  // previous index 7\n\n9: (2,6)  // previous index 8\n\n10: (1,6)  // previous index 9\n\n11: (1,5)  // previous index 10\n\nAnd tail (1,4) removed, so positions now 11 segments, tail at (1,5)\n\nThe cell (2,6) is now occupied by the segment that was there, but it moved to (3,6)? No: in the new positions, (2,6) is occupied by index 9, which is from previous (2,6), but since the snake moved, the segment that was at (2,6) is now at the position where the previous segment was, but it's confusing.\n\nThe point is, when the snake moves without eating, the entire body shifts forward, so the cell (2,6) is vacated only if the segment that was there moves and no new segment comes, but since the tail is removed, the cell is left empty.\n\nIn this case, after move, the cell (2,6) is now occupied by the segment that was at (1,6), which moved to (2,6)? From above: after move, positions include (2,6) as index 9, which came from previous (2,6)? Previous index 8 was (2,6), and after move, index 9 is (2,6), but it's the same cell? No.\n\nPrevious positions: index 8: (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (4,3) no eat: new index 9: (2,6) , but that's because the segment stayed? Let's list coordinates.\n\nPrevious: index 8: (2,6)\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, then each body segment takes the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for body segment i, it moves to the position of segment i-1 from previous state.\n\nIn previous state, segment 0: (5,3) head\n\nSegment 1: (6,3)\n\n...\n\nSegment 8: (2,6)\n\nSegment 9: (1,6)\n\nSegment 10: (1,5)\n\nSegment 11: (1,4) tail\n\nAfter move to (4,3), new head: (4,3)\n\nThen new segment 1: position of old segment 0: (5,3)\n\nNew segment 2: position of old segment 1: (6,3)\n\nNew segment 3: position of old segment 2: (6,4)\n\n...\n\nNew segment 9: position of old segment 8: (2,6)\n\nNew segment 10: position of old segment 9: (1,6)\n\nNew segment 11: position of old segment 10: (1,5)\n\nAnd old segment 11 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo the cell (2,6) is still occupied by the new segment 9, which is the same segment as old segment 8, but it's at the same position (2,6)? New segment 9 is at (2,6), so (2,6) is still occupied.\n\nThe segment that was at (2,6) is now at (2,6) in the new state, so the cell is not vacated.\n\nTo vacate (2,6), that segment needs to move away, which happens when the snake moves enough times that the tail moves past it.\n\nSince (2,6) is not the tail, it will be vacated only when the segment at (2,6) moves to a new position and no other segment moves to (2,6), which means when the tail is beyond that point.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves without eating, each move the tail advances, so the segment at (2,6) will eventually be the tail after some moves.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,4). The body from (2,6) to tail is: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) so 4 segments after (2,6).\n\nAfter (2,6) there are 3 segments to tail: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4).\n\nSo to make (2,6) the tail, I need to move 3 times without eating, so that the tail advances to where (2,6) was.\n\nAfter 3 moves without eating, the segment that was at (2,6) will be the new tail, and when it moves, (2,6) is vacated.\n\nThen I can move head to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nBut the food has life span, so I need to do it before it disappears.\n\nLife span of (2,6) is 9 on turn 35, so it will last until turn 43 or so, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nBut let's back to current turn.\n\nOption 2: move down to (6,2), no eat.\n\nThen head at (6,2), direction down.\n\nPositions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] tail at (1,5)\n\nThen from (6,2), direction down, so can move down, left, right.\n\nDown to (6,1): y=1, not wall, no obstacle, empty.\n\nLeft to (5,2): empty\n\nRight to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nUp to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, so collision if move up, but (6,3) is the first body segment, so moving up would cause head to hit body at (6,3), which is deadly.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), etc.\n\nIf move up to (6,3), head to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any body cell is death, except the tail cell under certain conditions.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if you move to the tail cell, and tail moves, it's ok, as long as no other collision.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (6,2), the tail is at (1,5), not (6,3), so (6,3) is body, not tail, so moving to it would be collision.\n\nSo from (6,2), possible moves: down to (6,1), left to (5,2), or right invalid, up invalid.\n\nNow, (6,1) is empty, (5,2) empty.\n\nNo food there.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (2,3) and (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is close to head now at (6,3), so moving left to (5,3) eats it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is also the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut here, tail is at (1,4), head at (6,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so |dx| + |dy| =1.\n\n(6,3) and (1,4) are far, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid layout.\n\nI should sketch the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the right and bottom, with a bend.\n\nFood: (2,3) at top-left, (5,3) near head, (2,6) at bottom-left under body.\n\n(2,6) is occupied.\n\nLife span: (2,3) life 4, so must be eaten by turn 38 (since on turn 35:4, 36:3, 37:2, 38:1, disappears after 38).\n\n(5,3) life 6, eat by turn 40.\n\n(2,6) life 9, eat by turn 43.\n\nNow, current turn 35.\n\nIf I eat (5,3) now, I get +1, but the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver later.\n\nIf I don't eat, I can go for (2,3) which is closer to expiring.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is not far, but I need to navigate there.\n\nFrom head (6,3), to go to (2,3), I can move left to (5,3) or down to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) has food, so if I move left, I eat it.\n\nIf I want to avoid eating (5,3) to go to (2,3), I could move down to (6,2), then from there, I can move left to (5,2) or down to (6,1), etc.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go to (5,2), then to (5,3), but (5,3) has food, so I would eat it if I go there.\n\nOr from (6,2) to (5,2), then to (4,2), etc, to reach (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) is at y=3, x=2.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (3,1), but that's below.\n\nAnother thing: the area around (2,3) might be tight.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nFirst, if I move down to (6,2) on turn 35.\n\nThen turn 36: head at (6,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (6,1), left to (5,2), or up to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, collision, so only down or left.\n\nSay I move left to (5,2) on turn 36.\n\nThen head to (5,2), no food there, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions before move: after turn 35, head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), ..., (1,5), tail (1,4) removed? After turn 35 down move: positions [ (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] tail at (1,5)\n\nMove to (5,2) no eat, so new positions: head (5,2), body: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  tail at (1,6)? New segment 10: (1,6) from previous (1,6), and tail removed was (1,5), so positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ] 11 segments, tail (1,6)\n\nDirection left.\n\nFrom (5,2), direction left, so can move left, down, up.\n\nLeft to (4,2): empty\n\nDown to (5,1): y=1, not wall, but (3,1) is obstacle, but (5,1) is different, so empty.\n\nUp to (5,3): (5,3) has food, so if move up, eat food.\n\n(5,3) has food, so moving up to (5,3) would eat it.\n\nThen head to (5,3), grow, so positions: [ (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ] tail at (1,6)\n\nDirection up.\n\nIf I don't want to eat, I can move left to (4,2) or down to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,3) is still there, life span decreases.\n\nNow, to reach (2,3), from (5,2), I can go left to (4,2), then to (3,2), but (3,2) is empty, then to (2,2), then to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) has food, so eat at (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) life span 4 on turn 35, on turn 36 it is 3, etc.\n\nTurn 35: I move down to (6,2)\n\nTurn 36: from (6,2) I can move left to (5,2) as above.\n\nThen turn 37: from (5,2) move left to (4,2) no eat\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction left.\n\nPositions: [ (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6)? Previous tail was (1,6), removed.\n\nAfter turn 36: positions [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ]\n\nMove to (4,2) no eat: new head (4,2), body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail at (2,6)? New segment 10: (2,6) from previous (2,6), and previous (1,6) removed, so positions: [ (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is now the tail, and it has food under it? Food is at (2,6), and now it's the tail cell.\n\nRule: if head moves to tail cell, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nBut here, the tail has food under it, so if head moves to (2,6), it would eat the food, but since it's the tail, and tail moves, it should be ok, but rule has \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, when you eat the food at tail, the tail doesn't move, so head moves to tail position, but tail is still there? Confusion.\n\nStandard: when you eat food, you grow, so tail doesn't move.\n\nIf you move head to a cell with food, you eat it, length increases, tail remains in place.\n\nIf that cell is the tail cell, and you eat the food there, then head moves to tail position, and since you grow, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are at the same position? That would be collision.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nRule: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo if you eat food that is at the current tail position, since tail doesn't move, head moves to tail, and they occupy same cell, death.\n\nBut in this case, for (2,6), it is under body, not necessarily tail.\n\nIn the above, when (2,6) is the tail, if I move head to (2,6), it would eat the food, but since it's tail, head moves to tail position, and tail doesn't move, so collision.\n\nTherefore, to eat food at (2,6), I must do it when it is not the tail, and after the body moves away.\n\nSpecifically, when the cell is vacated, then head moves to it.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, when (2,6) is not tail, and I move so that the segment leaves (2,6), then head can move to it.\n\nFor example, if I can make (2,6) vacated.\n\nBack to reaching (2,3).\n\nFrom turn 35, if I move down to (6,2), then to (5,2) on 36, then to (4,2) on 37, then on turn 37 head at (4,2), I can move up to (4,3) or left to (3,2), etc.\n\n(4,3) is empty, no food.\n\nThen to (3,3), but (3,3) is empty, but there is obstacle at (3,1), not issue.\n\nThen to (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) must be eaten by turn 38.\n\nTurn 35: move down to (6,2)\n\nTurn 36: move left to (5,2)\n\nTurn 37: move left to (4,2)  // now head at (4,2)\n\nOn turn 38, I can move up to (4,3) or left to (3,2), or down to (4,1) but (4,1) is empty, y=1.\n\nTo reach (2,3), from (4,2), move up to (4,3) on turn 38.\n\nThen head at (4,3), then on turn 39, move left to (3,3), then turn 40 to (2,3), but turn 40 is too late for (2,3), since (2,3) life span: on turn 35:4, 36:3, 37:2, 38:1, 39:0 disappear, so on turn 38, life span 1, can be eaten, but I am at (4,3) on turn 38, not at (2,3).\n\nOn turn 38, I am at (4,3) if I moved up from (4,2), but (2,3) is at x=2,y=3, I am at x=4,y=3, so I need to move left twice, but turn 38 is the last chance to eat (2,3).\n\nOn turn 38, if I am at (4,3), I can move left to (3,3) on turn 38, but (2,3) is at (2,3), not adjacent, so I can't reach it on turn 38.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 37, I could move directly towards (2,3), but (4,2) to (2,3) is not adjacent; I need to go via (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nShortest path: from (4,2) to (2,3) is |dx|=2, |dy|=1, so min 2 moves if I go (3,2) then (2,3) or (4,3) then (3,3) then (2,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach on turn 38, I need to be at (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nOn turn 37, I am at (4,2) after moving left from (5,2) on turn 36.\n\nTurn 36: from (6,2) move to (5,2), head at (5,2) on turn 36.\n\nTurn 37: from (5,2) move to (4,2), head at (4,2) on turn 37.\n\nNow on turn 37, I can move to (3,2) or to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is empty, no wall.\n\nFrom (4,2) move left to (3,2) on turn 37.\n\nThen head at (3,2) on turn 37.\n\nThen on turn 38, from (3,2) I can move up to (3,3) or right to (4,2) but occupied, or down to (3,1) but (3,1) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n(3,1) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nLeft to (2,2), which might be empty.\n\n(2,2) not occupied, no wall.\n\nSo from (3,2) on turn 38, move up to (3,3) or left to (2,2) or down invalid.\n\nTo reach (2,3), from (3,2), move up to (3,3) on turn 38, but (2,3) is at (2,3), not reached.\n\nMove left to (2,2) on turn 38, then on turn 39 to (2,3), but (2,3) disappears after turn 38, so on turn 39 it's gone.\n\n(2,3) can be eaten on turn 38 with life span 1, but not after.\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,3) by turn 38 if I start by moving down on turn 35.\n\nIf on turn 37 at (4,2), I move directly to (3,3)? But (3,3) is not adjacent to (4,2); adjacent cells share side, so (4,2) to (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), (5,2), but not (3,3).\n\nSo I need two moves to (2,3) from (4,2): e.g. to (3,2) then (2,2) or (3,3) but not directly.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (2,3): I can go to (3,2) then to (2,3) if possible, but (2,3) is at y=3, x=2, (3,2) at y=2,x=3, so moving from (3,2) to (2,3) is diagonal? No, not adjacent; adjacent are left, right, up, down.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (2,2), (3,1) invalid, (3,3), or (4,2).\n\nTo go to (2,3) from (3,2), I need to go to (2,2) or (3,3) first, then to (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) from (2,2) is up, or from (3,3) is left.\n\nBut on turn 37 at (4,2), move to (3,2) on turn 37, then on turn 38 at (3,2), move to (2,2) or to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 39, from (2,2) to (2,3) or from (3,3) to (2,3), but turn 39, (2,3) is gone.\n\nSo impossible to eat (2,3) if I don't start heading towards it earlier.\n\nTherefore, if I want to eat (2,3), I need to move towards it now on turn 35.\n\nFrom (6,3), to go to (2,3), I can move left to (5,3), but (5,3) has food, so I would eat it instead.\n\nIf I move left to (5,3), I eat (5,3), then I'm at (5,3) on turn 36, with direction left.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move left to (4,3), no food, or up to (5,4), or down to (5,2).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), so I can go left to (4,3) on turn 36, then to (3,3) on turn 37, then to (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nOn turn 38, (2,3) has life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nTurn 35: move left to (5,3), eat (5,3), head at (5,3), direction left.\n\nTurn 36: move left to (4,3), no food (assuming no food there), so no eat, tail moves.\n\nPositions after turn 35: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., (1,4) ] but with growth, 12 segments.\n\nAfter turn 35: positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail\n\nTurn 36: move left to (4,3), no food, so head to (4,3), tail moves: new positions [ (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] tail at (1,5)\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 37: from (4,3), move left to (3,3), no food, head to (3,3), tail moves: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ] tail at (1,6)\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 38: from (3,3), move left to (2,3), which has food, so eat it.\n\nHead to (2,3), grow, so positions: [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ] and tail (1,6) stays, so new tail is (1,6), but with growth, segment added, so positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), ..., up to (1,6), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so (1,6) is still there, and new segment at head, so tail is (1,6), positions include (2,6) as before? List:\n\nAfter eating at (2,3): new head (2,3), body: previous head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., (2,6), (1,6)\n\nPrevious positions before move: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ]\n\nMove to (2,3) eat, so new positions: head (2,3), then body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  // 12 segments, tail at (1,6)\n\n(2,6) is still occupied.\n\nDirection left.\n\nSo I ate both foods: (5,3) on turn 35 and (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nGood.\n\nIf I had not eaten (5,3) immediately, I might not reach (2,3) in time.\n\nFor example, if I moved down on turn 35 to (6,2), then I could only reach (5,3) later, but (2,3) would expire.\n\nSo for maximizing score, eating both is better.\n\nNow, about the food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has life span 9, so it can be eaten later.\n\nCurrently, it's under body at (2,6).\n\nAfter the above moves, on turn 38, (2,6) is still occupied by body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to vacate (2,6).\n\nSince (2,6) is a body segment, when the snake moves without eating, it will eventually become the tail or be vacated.\n\nIn the current state after turn 38, positions include (2,6) as a body segment.\n\nThe tail is at (1,6).\n\nTo vacate (2,6), I need the segment there to move away.\n\nFor example, if I move without eating, the tail will advance, and after some moves, (2,6) will be the tail.\n\nFrom above, after turn 38, positions: head (2,3), body segments down to (1,6) tail.\n\nThe segment at (2,6) is, let's see the positions: [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ] so (2,6) is index 11? Index 0: (2,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (2,6), 12: (1,6) tail.\n\n(2,6) is index 11, which is not tail; tail is (1,6).\n\nAfter (2,6) is index 11, then tail index 12: (1,6).\n\nSo to make (2,6) the tail, I need to move 1 time without eating, so that the tail advances to (2,6).\n\nAfter one move without eating, the segment at (2,6) becomes the new tail.\n\nThen, when it moves, (2,6) is vacated.\n\nBut since it has food, I can then move head to it.\n\nBut there is tail reward danger if head is adjacent when eating.\n\nFirst, after turn 38, head at (2,3), direction left.\n\nI can move from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate action on turn 35.\n\nBack to turn 35.\n\nIf I move left to (5,3), I eat (5,3), and I can still reach (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nIf I move down to (6,2), I might not get (2,3), and I can eat (5,3) later, but (5,3) has more life span, so I can eat it say on turn 36 or 37.\n\nFor example, turn 35 move down to (6,2)\n\nTurn 36 move left to (5,2)\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move up to (5,3) to eat (5,3) on turn 36 or 37.\n\nOn turn 36 at (5,2), move up to (5,3) eat.\n\nBut I miss (2,3).\n\nSince (2,3) gives same score, but I might be able to get (2,6) later.\n\nBut to maximize, getting both (5,3) and (2,3) is better than getting only (5,3) or only (2,3).\n\nIn the first path, I get both.\n\nIn the second, I get only (5,3) and miss (2,3).\n\nSo moving left to (5,3) on turn 35 seems better.\n\nMoreover, after that, I can plan to eat (2,6).\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nWhen I move to (5,3), I eat, grow, so snake is longer, which might make it harder to move around, but the grid is not too small.\n\nGrid is 6x6 playable, snake length 12 after eating both, which is half the grid, 36 cells, so possible.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,3) on turn 38, head at (2,3), I can then go down to free (2,6) or something.\n\nBut (2,6) is occupied.\n\nTo eat (2,6), I need to vacate it.\n\nSince it has high life span, I can do it later.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might block some paths, but not critical now.\n\nAlso, I should consider avoiding dead ends.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left area has the snake body, so it might be tight.\n\nBut with careful moves.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output for the current turn and future turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut I don't have to specify all, but since it says \"maximize score\" and \"prioritize long-term\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the food might change, but in this state, no new food mentioned, so I assume only these foods.\n\nThe state is given, and no mention of new food spawning, so I think only existing foods.\n\nSo for turn 35, I should move left to eat (5,3).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan to go to (2,3).\n\nAs above.\n\nThen for (2,6), later.\n\nBut to output, I need to write actions for several turns.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with Turn 35: action, Turn 36: action, etc.\n\nBut I don't know how many, but at least for current and a few ahead.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the life spans.\n\nTurn 35: move L to (5,3) eat food.\n\nThen turn 36: from (5,3) direction left, move L to (4,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 37: from (4,3) direction left, move L to (3,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 38: from (3,3) direction left, move L to (2,3) eat food.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 38, head at (2,3), direction left.\n\nThen I need to think about (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) is occupied, and life span 9, so on turn 38 it has life span 9 - (38-35) = since turn 35:9, turn 36:8, ..., turn 38:7, so plenty.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move down, up, right, but not left since direction left, opposite is right, so cannot move right? Direction is left, so opposite is right? Current direction after moving to (2,3) is left, since I moved left to get there.\n\nOn turn 38, after moving to (2,3), direction is left.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves: left to (1,3), but x=1, y=3, is it wall? Borders: x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 is playable, y=3 playable.\n\n(1,3) is empty? Snake positions after turn 38: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) tail.\n\nSo (1,3) not occupied, so can move left to (1,3).\n\nDown to (2,2): empty? (2,2) not occupied.\n\nUp to (2,4): empty.\n\nRight to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision, so cannot.\n\nSince direction left, cannot move right (opposite).\n\nSo possible: left to (1,3), down to (2,2), up to (2,4).\n\nAll safe.\n\nTo go towards (2,6), which is at (2,6), same x, different y.\n\nSo I can move down to (2,2), but (2,6) is down, y decreasing? y=6 is bottom, y=3 is middle.\n\ny from 1 to 6, y=6 bottom, y=1 top? In coordinates, y=0 top wall, y=7 bottom wall, so y increases down? Usually in grids, y=0 top, y=7 bottom.\n\nIn the positions, head at (6,3), and body at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), so y=6 is below y=3.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is bottom-left.\n\nSo (2,3) is at x=2,y=3, (2,6) at x=2,y=6, so down direction.\n\nFrom (2,3), to reach (2,6), I need to move down.\n\nBut (2,6) is occupied by body, so I need to free it first.\n\nI can move down to (2,2) or (2,4), etc.\n\nBut since I want to free (2,6), I should move in a way that the tail advances.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,6).\n\nAfter moving without eating, the tail will move.\n\nFor example, if I move from (2,3) down to (2,2) on turn 39, no eat, then positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., (1,6) but tail moves, so new tail at where previous segment was.\n\nPrevious positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nMove to (2,2) no eat: new head (2,2), body: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  tail at (2,6)? New segment 12: (2,6) from previous (2,6), and previous (1,6) removed.\n\nSo positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6)\n\nNow (2,6) is the tail, and it has food under it.\n\nIf I move head to (2,6), since it has food, I would eat it, but head moves to tail position, and tail doesn't move, so collision, death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat it when it is the tail.\n\nI need to eat it when it is vacated.\n\nSo, to vacate (2,6), I need to move so that the segment leaves and no one comes, but since it was body, when it moves away and the cell is empty, then head can go.\n\nIn this case, when (2,6) is not tail, and I move, it leaves the cell.\n\nFor example, in the state after turn 38, (2,6) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nIf I move without eating, on next move, the segment at (2,6) will move to where the previous segment was, which is (3,6), and the cell (2,6) will be occupied by the next segment or vacated.\n\nAfter turn 38 positions: let's index: 0:(2,3), 1:(3,3), 2:(4,3), 3:(5,3), 4:(6,3), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,5), 7:(6,6), 8:(5,6), 9:(4,6), 10:(3,6), 11:(2,6), 12:(1,6) tail\n\nIf I move to say (2,4) on turn 39, no eat, then new head (2,4), body: 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,6), 9: (5,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (2,6)  // new segment 12: (2,6) from previous (2,6), and tail (1,6) removed.\n\nSo (2,6) is still occupied.\n\nThe segment that was at (2,6) is now at (3,6) or something.\n\nPrevious index 11: (2,6)\n\nAfter move, new segment 12: position of old segment 11: (2,6), so same cell.\n\nTo vacate (2,6), I need the segment to move away and no segment to come, which happens when the tail is such that after move, the cell is left empty.\n\nSpecifically, when the segment at (2,6) is not the last, but when it moves, and the tail is removed, if it was the second last, it might vacate.\n\nFor example, if (2,6) is the segment before tail.\n\nIn after turn 38, index 11: (2,6), index 12: (1,6) tail.\n\nSo (2,6) is the segment before tail.\n\nWhen I move without eating, the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so new segment 1: old head, new segment 2: old segment 1, ..., new segment 11: old segment 10, new segment 12: old segment 11, and old tail removed.\n\nSo new segment 12 is at old segment 11 position, which is (2,6), and old segment 11 was (2,6), so still occupied.\n\nThen the cell is not vacated.\n\nWhen the tail moves, it leaves the cell empty only if no segment moves to it, but in this case, since (2,6) is not tail, it doesn't move away; it stays or moves to another position.\n\nThe cell (2,6) is vacated only when the segment that was there moves to a new position and no other segment moves to it, which means that segment must be the tail, and when it moves, the cell is empty.\n\nBut if it is the tail and has food, eating causes collision.\n\nOtherwise, if it is not tail, the cell is always occupied until it becomes tail.\n\nBut when it becomes tail, eating the food there causes collision.\n\nSo the only way to eat food under body is to have it not be the tail when you eat, but to have the cell vacated.\n\nBut from above, the cell is only vacated when the tail moves away from it, but at that point, there is no food or the food is gone.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose a cell has food under a body segment.\n\nWhen that body segment moves (because the snake moves), it leaves the cell, and at the same time, the next segment may move into it or not.\n\nIf the segment was not the last, the next segment moves into it, so it remains occupied.\n\nIf the segment was the last before tail, then when it moves, the tail moves into it if the tail was adjacent, but in snake movement, the segments shift.\n\nThe cell is vacated only when the tail moves away and no segment is moving into it.\n\nFor example, if the tail is at position P, and I move, the tail leaves P, and if P is not the position of any other segment, it is empty.\n\nBut for a body segment at Q, to vacate Q, Q must be the tail position, and when I move, the tail leaves Q, so Q is empty.\n\nThen I can move head to Q to eat the food.\n\nBut at that time, the food is at Q, which was just vacated by tail.\n\nThen if I move head to Q, I eat the food, but since it was just tail, and I eat, the head moves to Q, and since I grow, the tail doesn't move, so if the tail was at Q, but it moved away, so Q is empty, head moves to Q, eats, tail stays where it is, no collision.\n\nCase: suppose tail is at T, and I move, tail moves to new position, T is vacated.\n\nIf there is food at T, now T is empty with food.\n\nThen I can move head to T, eat the food, grow, so tail does not move, head at T, no problem.\n\nBut the tail reward danger is when the head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food, eating it causes collision because head and tail at same cell.\n\nIn this case, when I move head to the vacated cell, the tail is not there anymore, so no adjacency issue.\n\nFor example, to eat (2,6), I need to make it the tail first.\n\nThen when I move, the tail leaves (2,6), vacating it with food.\n\nThen I can move head to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nBut at that point, the head may not be adjacent to (2,6), so I need to plan to be near.\n\nIn after turn 38 state, (2,6) is not tail; tail is (1,6).\n\nI need to move so that (2,6) becomes tail.\n\nAfter one move without eating, (2,6) becomes tail.\n\nFor example, on turn 39, from (2,3) move to (2,2) no eat, then as before, positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,6) tail.\n\n(2,6) is now tail.\n\nThen on turn 40, I can move the snake so that the tail leaves (2,6).\n\nFor example, move in a direction that the tail moves away.\n\nFrom (2,2), direction down (since moved down to (2,2)? On turn 39 move to (2,2), direction down.\n\nThen turn 40, from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1), left to (1,2), up to (2,3) but occupied, right to (3,2).\n\nSay move down to (2,1), no eat, then head to (2,1), tail moves: previous tail (2,6) moves to where? New positions: head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), ..., up to the previous segment before tail.\n\nPrevious positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail\n\nMove to (2,1) no eat: new head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)  // new segment 12: (3,6) from previous (3,6), and tail (2,6) removed.\n\nSo (2,6) is vacated, and since food is there, now (2,6) is empty with food.\n\nThen I can move head to (2,6) to eat it, but head is at (2,1), (2,6) is at distance, so I need to go there.\n\nBut I can do that later.\n\nFirst, for turn 35, I think moving left to eat (5,3) is the best to also get (2,3).\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 35: L (to eat (5,3))\n\nThen Turn 36: L (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 37: L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 38: L (to (2,3) eat)\n\nThen for future, I can add, but not necessary.\n\nSince it says think 5+ turns, output 5 turns.\n\nTurn 39: from (2,3) direction left, I can move down to (2,2) to start freeing (2,6), but not urgent.\n\nOr move up to (2,4) to explore.\n\nBut to be specific.\n\nSince the answer format is for the actions, and I need to maximize score, eating both foods is good.\n\nIf I move down on turn 35, I might only get one food.\n\nSo I think L is better.\n\nAlso, avoiding risks: by moving L, I eat immediately, no risk, and then go to (2,3).\n\nMoving down might lead to dead end or something, but not really.\n\nSo I'll go with L for turn 35.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (2,3) before it expires (life span 4, must be eaten by turn 38) while also considering the food at (5,3) and (2,6). The snake starts at (6,3) with direction down. The food at (5,3) is immediately accessible and can be eaten on turn 35, providing +1 score and growth. After eating (5,3), the snake can navigate toward (2,3) to eat it on turn 38, just before it expires. The food at (2,6) is under the body and cannot be eaten immediately; it will be addressed later after vacating the cell, as its life span (9) allows more time.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 35)**: Move left (L) to (5,3) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases). This avoids missing (5,3) and positions the snake to reach (2,3) in time.\n- **Path to (2,3)**: From (5,3), moving left for three turns (turns 36–38) brings the head to (2,3) on turn 38, eating it (+1 score) before it disappears.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: \n  - Moving left on turn 35 is safe: (5,3) is not adjacent to the tail, so no tail reward danger.\n  - The path to (2,3) avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n  - After eating (2,3), the snake can focus on vacating and eating (2,6) in later turns (beyond turn 40), as its life span allows.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Eating both foods increases length but the grid (6x6 playable area) has space for maneuvering. The sequence avoids dead ends and prioritizes food with shorter life spans first.\n\n### Planned Moves (5 turns ahead):\n- **Turn 35**: Move L to (5,3) – Eat food at (5,3) (+1 score, length increases to 12).\n- **Turn 36**: Move L to (4,3) – No food, tail moves, direction now left.\n- **Turn 37**: Move L to (3,3) – No food, tail moves, direction left.\n- **Turn 38**: Move L to (2,3) – Eat food at (2,3) (+1 score, length increases to 13), direction left.\n- **Turn 39**: Move D to (2,2) – No food, tail moves, direction down. (Begins process to vacate (2,6) for future eating.)\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Turns 35–38**: This sequence eats both (5,3) and (2,3), maximizing score with +2. Missing (2,3) by moving down on turn 35 would lose the opportunity, as it expires on turn 38.\n- **Turn 39**: Moving down starts positioning to vacate (2,6) (now the tail after turn 38). On turn 40, moving down again would vacate (2,6), allowing the head to eat it later (e.g., by navigating to (2,6) once empty).\n- **Risk Assessment**: No collisions or wall hits in this sequence. Tail reward danger is avoided as no food is eaten when adjacent to the tail.\n\nThis plan scores 2 points in 4 turns and sets up for eating (2,6) safely after turn 40.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 35: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 36: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 37: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 38: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 39: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (5,3) from (6,3) I think? Let's list the positions in order:\n\n- Head: (5,3)\n\n- Then: (6,3) — that's the first body segment, which is where the head was before.\n\nSince the head is at (5,3) and direction is L, it came from (6,3), so previous position was (6,3).\n\nThe positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nSo the snake is 12 segments long. Head at (5,3), tail at (1,4).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- One food at (2,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 36, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 38? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + N - 1? For example, at turn t, life span N, after this turn, it becomes N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then disappears. So if life span is 3 at turn 36, at turn 37 it will be 2, turn 38 it will be 1, turn 39 it will be 0 and disappear? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn t, if life span is N, then after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on. When it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before the next? I think it's standard to assume that at the beginning of the turn, we see the state, then we move, then food life span decreases after the move.\n\nBut for planning, since we think about the current turn, we need to consider if food will be there in future turns.\n\nFor food at (2,3): position (2,3), value 1, life span 3 at turn 36. So it will be present on turns 36, 37, 38, and disappear after turn 38, so not available on turn 39.\n\nSimilarly, second food: (2,6) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will be around for a long time, until turn 36 + 8 - 1? Life span 8 at turn 36, so turns 36 to 43? Let's not get bogged down; I can track it.\n\nBut (2,6) is a food position, but look at snake positions: (2,6) is part of the snake body! Snake has (3,6), (2,6), etc. Specifically, (2,6) is the 9th segment? Positions: index 0: head (5,3), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (2,6), 9: (1,6), 10: (1,5), 11: (1,4) tail.\n\nSo (2,6) is occupied by the snake body segment at index 8.\n\nBut the food is at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 8.\n\nThere's a rule about food spawning under the snake's body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nSo here, food is at (2,6), which is currently occupied by the snake body. So it's under the body. To eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body leaves (2,6), and then the head moves to (2,6) when it's empty.\n\nBut since it's under the body, the head can't move there directly; it has to be freed first.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut here, tail is at (1,4), and food is at (2,6), not near tail directly.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the move for turn 36.\n\nHead at (5,3), direction L, so last move was left to (5,3) from (6,3).\n\nPossible moves: U (up, to (5,4)), D (down, to (5,2)), L (left, to (4,3)), R (right, to (6,3)).\n\nBut R is opposite to current direction? Current head direction is L, so moving right would be reverse.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo, since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right), because that would be opposite.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is an obstacle, but head is at (5,3), so not immediately relevant.\n\nNow, let's see the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except where obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail\n\nFood: (2,3) and (2,6) but (2,6) is occupied by snake.\n\n(2,6) has food under it, but snake is there.\n\nNow, for turn 36, I need to choose action: U, D, or L.\n\nFirst, let's think about the food at (2,3). It's at (2,3), which is not occupied, and life span 3, so available for 3 turns including this one.\n\nWhere is (2,3)? x=2, y=3.\n\nSnake head is at (5,3), same y, different x.\n\nTo reach (2,3), I need to go left, but there might be obstacles.\n\nPath to (2,3): from (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), then (3,3), then (2,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is not occupied? Let's see what cells are free.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake:\n\n(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nAlso walls: (3,1) and borders.\n\nSo free cells: for example, (1,1) to (6,6) except snake and (3,1).\n\nSpecifically, (2,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free and has food.\n\n(2,3) is not listed in snake, so yes, free.\n\n(3,3) is not listed, so free.\n\n(4,3) is not listed? Snake has (5,3) and (6,3), so (4,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) free, (2,3) free.\n\nBut (2,6) has food but occupied.\n\nFor (2,3) food, I can potentially eat it soon.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's the food at (2,6) under the body, which might be valuable if I can free it.\n\nFirst, let's consider possible moves for turn 36.\n\nHead at (5,3), can move:\n\n- U: to (5,4)\n\n- D: to (5,2)\n\n- L: to (4,3)\n\nR is not possible due to reverse rule.\n\nNow, what are the risks?\n\nIf I move U to (5,4): is (5,4) safe? (5,4) not occupied by snake? Snake has (6,4), (6,5), etc., but (5,4) is not in positions. Positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), ... so (5,4) is free? (5,4) is between (5,3) and (6,4)? No, (5,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) should be free.\n\n(4,3) should be free.\n\nNow, walls: (5,4) is within 1-6, y=4, x=5, no wall, not obstacle.\n\n(5,2): y=2, x=5, should be free, but internal obstacle is (3,1), not here.\n\n(4,3): x=4,y=3, free.\n\nBut after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food, otherwise not.\n\nNow, for each move, I need to simulate the future.\n\nAlso, tail is at (1,4), and it will move when the snake moves, unless it eats food.\n\nSince no food eaten yet, tail will move away.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (2,3).\n\nIt's at (2,3), value +1, life span 3.\n\nIf I go directly left, to (4,3) on turn 36, then on turn 37 I can go to (3,3), then turn 38 to (2,3) to eat it, but life span: at turn 36, life span 3, so on turn 38, if I move to (2,3), what is the life span?\n\nAt turn 36: food at (2,3) with life 3\n\nAfter turn 36 move, life decreases to 2.\n\nTurn 37: after move, life decreases to 1.\n\nTurn 38: if I move to (2,3), I eat it before life decreases? I think we move first, then if head on food, eat, then life decreases or something.\n\nThe sequence: at the start of turn, state is given, we choose action, move head to new position.\n\nIf new position has food, eat it: if positive, length increases, tail doesn't move; if negative, length same, tail moves.\n\nThen, after move, food life span decreases by 1 for each food present.\n\nAlso, if life span becomes 0, food disappears.\n\nFor (2,3) at turn 36, life span 3.\n\nAfter turn 36 move: if head moves to a cell with food, eat it; then for all food, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo if I don't eat it on turn 36, after move, life span becomes 2.\n\nSimilarly for turn 37, after move, life span 1.\n\nTurn 38, after move, if I eat it, life span was 1 before decrease? Let's clarify.\n\nStandard way: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L.\n\nWe choose action, move head.\n\nIf head moves to a cell with food, consume it immediately (grow or not).\n\nThen, for all food on the board, life span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life span reaches 0 after decrease, food is removed.\n\nSo for (2,3) at turn 36: L=3\n\nAfter turn 36 move:\n\n- If head moves to (2,3) on turn 36, eat it, then L decreases to 2 for other food, but this food is eaten, so gone.\n\n- If not, then L decreases to 2 after the move.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nIn this case, head is at (5,3), (2,3) is three cells away, so I can't eat it on turn 36.\n\nEarliest I can eat is turn 38 if I go directly left.\n\nTurn 36: move to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: move to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: move to (2,3) and eat, since L was 3 at start turn 36, after turn 36 move, L=2; after turn 37 move, L=1; on turn 38, if I move to (2,3), I eat it when L=1, then after eat, L decreases to 0 and disappears, but since eaten, it's fine.\n\nNow, on turn 38, before move, L=1, I move to it, eat it.\n\nBut I need to reach (2,3) by turn 38.\n\nNow, the other food at (2,6) with L=8, long life, but it's under snake body at (2,6).\n\nTo eat that, I need the snake to move so that the body leaves (2,6), then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is occupied by the 8th segment, which is not the tail; tail is at (1,4).\n\nThe snake will move, so segments shift.\n\nFor example, on turn 36, if I move to a new position, the head moves, and the tail may move if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail moves away from (1,4) to the next position.\n\nBut (2,6) is a body segment; when the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSo after a move, the segment at (2,6) will be occupied by the next segment in line.\n\nLet's simulate one move.\n\nSuppose on turn 36, I move to (4,3) for example.\n\nThen new head position (4,3), and the body: the segment that was at index 1 (6,3) moves to head old position (5,3)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo positions: before move: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., (1,4) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,3): new positions: head at (4,3), then body: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,3), then (6,3) moves to where the first body was? Let's index.\n\nLet S[0] = head = (5,3)\n\nS[1] = (6,3)\n\nS[2] = (6,4)\n\nS[3] = (6,5)\n\nS[4] = (6,6)\n\nS[5] = (5,6)\n\nS[6] = (4,6)\n\nS[7] = (3,6)\n\nS[8] = (2,6)\n\nS[9] = (1,6)\n\nS[10] = (1,5)\n\nS[11] = (1,4)  // tail\n\nAfter move, if head moves to new_pos, then new body: S[0] new = new_pos\n\nS[1] new = old S[0] = (5,3)\n\nS[2] new = old S[1] = (6,3)\n\nS[3] new = old S[2] = (6,4)\n\n...\n\nS[11] new = old S[10] = (1,5)\n\nAnd the tail old position (1,4) is vacated.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail moves, so the segment at S[11] is removed, and S[10] becomes the new tail? In terms of positions, the list shrinks only if no growth; but since no food, the snake doesn't grow, so the tail position is left.\n\nIn this case, after move to (4,3), new positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // and (1,4) is free now.\n\nOld S[11] was (1,4), not occupied anymore.\n\nNow, (2,6) is still occupied, by what was S[8] old, which is now S[9] new? Old S[8] = (2,6), and after move, since head moved left, the body shifts, so old S[8] is now at position S[9] in new list.\n\nNew positions: index 0: (4,3)\n\nIndex 1: old S[0] = (5,3)\n\nIndex 2: old S[1] = (6,3)\n\nIndex 3: old S[2] = (6,4)\n\nIndex 4: old S[3] = (6,5)\n\nIndex 5: old S[4] = (6,6)\n\nIndex 6: old S[5] = (5,6)\n\nIndex 7: old S[6] = (4,6)\n\nIndex 8: old S[7] = (3,6)\n\nIndex 9: old S[8] = (2,6)  // still here\n\nIndex 10: old S[9] = (1,6)\n\nIndex 11: old S[10] = (1,5)  // new tail\n\nAnd old S[11] (1,4) is free.\n\nSo (2,6) is still occupied by the body.\n\nTo free (2,6), I need the snake to move such that the segment that was at (2,6) moves away, and no other segment is there when it leaves.\n\nSince the snake moves, (2,6) will be vacated only when the segment that is there moves to another position.\n\nIn this case, the segment at (2,6) is S[9] in new positions after turn 36 move, but it depends on future moves.\n\nThe position (2,6) will be empty when the segment that occupies it moves to a new cell, and no other segment moves to it immediately, but since the body follows, when a segment leaves a cell, it might be occupied by the next or not.\n\nIn snake movement, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so a cell is vacated only when the tail moves and no growth.\n\nFor a body cell to be freed, it happens when the tail moves away from that cell, but (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (1,5) or something.\n\n(2,6) is a middle segment, so it will only be freed if the snake shortens or changes path such that that segment is no longer part of the body, but since no negative food, length only increases, so once a segment is part of body, it stays until tail moves past it.\n\nSpecifically, the cell (2,6) will be occupied until the tail moves away from it, which requires the snake to move without eating, so tail moves.\n\nFor example, if the snake never eats food, it will eventually move and the tail will leave positions.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is occupied by S[8] in old, which is not tail; tail is S[11].\n\nAfter each move without eating, the tail moves forward.\n\nSo the distance from (2,6) to tail: in the list, S[8] is at (2,6), S[9] at (1,6), S[10] at (1,5), S[11] at (1,4), so (2,6) is 3 segments away from tail.\n\nAfter one move without eating, tail moves to S[10] old position, which is (1,5), and S[9] moves to (1,6), S[8] moves to (2,6) still? From above, after move to (4,3), S[9] new is at (2,6), S[10] at (1,6), S[11] at (1,5).\n\nSo (2,6) still occupied.\n\nAfter another move without eating, say turn 37, if I move head somewhere, no eat, then new positions: head to new cell, body shifts, S[11] new will be old S[10] = (1,6), so tail at (1,6), and S[9] new is old S[8] = (3,6)? Let's not get messy.\n\nThe cell (2,6) will be occupied until the segment that was at (2,6) becomes the tail and then moves away.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (2,6) is the 8th segment from head, so it will take 8 moves without eating for it to become the tail, because each move, the tail index increases or something.\n\nInitial positions: 12 segments.\n\nThe segment at position k will become the tail after (11-k) moves without eating, because the tail is at index 11, so for k=8, it takes 3 moves to become tail: after first move, it becomes index 9, then 10, then 11, so after 3 moves, it is the tail, and on the next move, it moves away.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt turn 36, S[8] at (2,6)\n\nAfter one move no eat: new S[9] at (2,6)  // since old S[8] is now S[9]\n\nAfter two moves no eat: new S[10] at (2,6)\n\nAfter three moves no eat: new S[11] at (2,6)  // now it is the tail\n\nAfter fourth move no eat: when head moves, tail moves away, so (2,6) is vacated.\n\nSo it takes 4 moves without eating to free the cell (2,6).\n\nThen, after it's free, I can move head to it to eat the food.\n\nBut the food has life span 8 at turn 36, so it will be there for a while.\n\nLife span 8, so from turn 36 to turn 43 it exists, since decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 36, L=8\n\nAfter turn 36 move, L=7 if not eaten\n\nAfter turn 37 move, L=6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 43 move, L=0, disappears.\n\nSo available until turn 43 inclusive if not eaten earlier.\n\nWith 4 moves to free it, I can free it by turn 40 or so.\n\nBut I need to plan to eat it after it's free.\n\nNow, back to current turn.\n\nI have two foods: one at (2,3) with short life, must eat soon, and one at (2,6) with long life but under body.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dying.\n\nCurrent head position (5,3), and the body is around.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y from 0 to 7, cols x from 0 to 7. Playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 for all, and (3,1) obstacle.\n\nSnake:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nThen: (6,3) - right of head\n\nThen (6,4) - above that\n\n(6,5) - up\n\n(6,6) - up\n\n(5,6) - left\n\n(4,6) - left\n\n(3,6) - left\n\n(2,6) - left\n\n(1,6) - left\n\n(1,5) - down\n\n(1,4) - down  // tail\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the top and left, with head at (5,3).\n\nFood at (2,3) - which is left, same row as head but x=2.\n\nFood at (2,6) under snake body at (2,6).\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3).\n\nR to (6,3) but not allowed, reverse.\n\nNow, (5,4): what is there? Free? Snake has (6,4), which is different cell, so (5,4) should be free. Similarly, (5,2) free, (4,3) free.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), then head at (5,4), which is above.\n\nThen body: (5,3) where head was, then (6,3), etc.\n\nTail moves to (1,5) or something.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThe food at (2,3) is close and will disappear soon, so I should go for it if possible.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go L to (4,3) on turn 36.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (4,3), I can go L to (3,3), or U to (4,4), or D to (4,2), etc.\n\nThen on turn 38, from (3,3) I can go to (2,3) to eat the food.\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3, and it's free.\n\nBut is (3,3) free? Yes, no snake there.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (3,1), but that's below.\n\nNow, when I go to (2,3) on turn 38, I eat the food, so snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut life span: at turn 36, food at (2,3) L=3\n\nTurn 36: I move to (4,3), no eat, so after move, L decreases to 2.\n\nTurn 37: I move to (3,3), no eat, after move L decreases to 1.\n\nTurn 38: I move to (2,3), head on food, eat it (value +1, grow), then after eat, L decreases to 0, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 38.\n\nIf I go directly left.\n\nBut on turn 36, if I move L to (4,3), that's fine.\n\nBut what about the direction? Current direction is L, so moving L is allowed, not reverse.\n\nU and D are also possible.\n\nIf I move U or D, I might not reach (2,3) in time.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,4) on turn 36, then from there, to go to (2,3) I need to go left and down, which might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nSo for the short-life food, moving L seems best.\n\nBut are there risks?\n\nWhen I go to (4,3) on turn 36, is it safe? (4,3) is free, no wall.\n\nThen to (3,3) on turn 37, (3,3) is free.\n\nThen to (2,3) on turn 38.\n\n(2,3) is free, no issue.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases.\n\nBut I also have the other food at (2,6) to consider for later.\n\nMoreover, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (1,4), and food at (2,6) not near.\n\nNow, but after eating at (2,3), head at (2,3), and I need to think where to go next.\n\nBut let's first plan for turn 36.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not going for (2,3) if it's risky, but it seems safe.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), which is below, but not directly in path.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, from (2,3), after eating, I can go to other places.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSo let's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 36: move L to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 37: from (4,3), move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: from (3,3), move L to (2,3) and eat food.\n\nNow, after that, head at (2,3), and since ate food, snake grows, so the tail does not move; the new position is added, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: after turn 38, head at (2,3), and the body includes the previous head at (3,3), and so on, but since ate, the tail stays where it was, so the segment that was tail remains.\n\nBefore turn 38, positions: let's not simulate all, but after eating at (2,3), head at (2,3), and the body from previous: after turn 37, head was at (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), etc., but after move to (2,3) and eat, new head (2,3), new body: previous head position (3,3), then previous body, and tail does not move, so the tail segment remains.\n\nSpecifically, before turn 38 move: assume after turn 37, positions: head at (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., up to tail at (1,5) or something. I need to track.\n\nBut since we're planning, I can assume the path.\n\nAfter eating at (2,3), head at (2,3), and I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3): U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is the first body segment, since after eating, the body includes (3,3).\n\nSo if I move R to (3,3), I collide with body, die.\n\nSimilarly, L to (1,3): is (1,3) free? Currently, snake has positions like (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but (1,3) might be free.\n\nAt turn 38, before move, after turn 37, what are positions?\n\nTurn 36: move L to (4,3)\n\nAfter turn 36: head (4,3), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // tail at (1,5), and (1,4) free.\n\nTurn 37: move L to (3,3)\n\nHead to (3,3), which is free? (3,3) not occupied, yes.\n\nThen new positions: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  // tail at (1,6), since no eat, tail moved from (1,5) to? After move, S[1] = old head (4,3), S[2] = old S[1] (5,3), ..., S[11] = old S[10] (1,6), and old S[11] (1,5) free.\n\nOld tail was (1,5), now new tail is (1,6).\n\nNow turn 38: move to (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is free, has food? Yes, food at (2,3), so move to (2,3), eat it.\n\nSince eat positive food, snake grows, so new head at (2,3), and the body: the previous positions, but tail does not move, so new positions: head (2,3), then body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)  // and since grow, we add a new segment? No, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the length increases by one; the new tail is the old tail, but since tail didn't move, it stays, and a new segment is added at the head? Standard: after moving to food, head is on food, then the body is the old head position, and the tail stays, so the list has one more element.\n\nBefore move: positions: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., (1,6) ] 12 positions? After turn 37, 12 positions: indices 0 to 11.\n\nAfter move to (2,3) and eat: new head at (2,3), then body: old head (3,3), then old body (4,3), (5,3), ..., up to old tail (1,6), and since grow, the tail doesn't move, so the old tail is still there, so now 13 positions: [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ]\n\nNow, (2,6) is still occupied, with food under it.\n\nHead at (2,3).\n\nNow, from here, I need to move: possible U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, so R is death.\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) is free? Currently, no snake at (1,3), walls: x=1 to6, y=1 to6, (1,3) should be free.\n\nU to (2,4): free? Not occupied.\n\nD to (2,2): free, but there is obstacle at (3,1), not here.\n\nNow, I need to think about the other food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has food under it, and it's occupied by body segment at (2,6) in the list, which is position 11 or something.\n\nIn new positions: index 0: head (2,3)\n\nIndex 1: (3,3)\n\nIndex 2: (4,3)\n\n...\nIndex 10: (3,6)? List: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo (2,6) is at index 11, and (1,6) at index 12 tail.\n\nTo free (2,6), I need the snake to move so that this segment moves away.\n\nSince it's not tail, I need to move without eating until this segment becomes tail and moves.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is index 11, tail is index 12 at (1,6).\n\nAfter one move without eating: if I move head to a new position, no food, then new head, body shifts, the segment at old index 11 (2,6) moves to where? New positions: head to new cell, then body[1] = old head (2,3), body[2] = old body[1] (3,3), ..., body[12] = old body[11] (2,6)? Let's index properly.\n\nPositions: S[0] = (2,3), S[1] = (3,3), S[2] = (4,3), S[3] = (5,3), S[4] = (6,3), S[5] = (6,4), S[6] = (6,5), S[7] = (6,6), S[8] = (5,6), S[9] = (4,6), S[10] = (3,6), S[11] = (2,6), S[12] = (1,6)\n\nAfter move, say to (1,3) for example, head to (1,3), no food (assume), then new S[0] = (1,3), S[1] = old S[0] (2,3), S[2] = old S[1] (3,3), ..., S[12] = old S[11] (2,6), and S[13] = old S[12] (1,6)? No, since no grow, length same, so new positions: S[0] new = new head (1,3), S[1] = old S[0] (2,3), S[2] = old S[1] (3,3), S[3] = old S[2] (4,3), ..., up to S[12] = old S[11] (2,6), and old S[12] (1,6) is vacated, so no S[13], only 13 positions but tail moved.\n\nNew list: [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] and tail at (2,6)? S[12] = (2,6)\n\nOld S[12] was (1,6), vacated.\n\nSo (2,6) is still occupied, now by the last segment, which is tail? S[12] = (2,6), and it is the tail now.\n\nAfter this move, (2,6) is the tail position.\n\nThen on next move, if I move head somewhere and no eat, tail moves away, so (2,6) is freed.\n\nFor example, on turn 39, from head at (2,3) after eat, I move to (1,3) say, no food, then head to (1,3), body shifts, new tail at (2,6), since S[12] new = old S[11] (2,6)\n\nThen on turn 40, I move head from (1,3) to another cell, no food, then new head position, body shifts, tail moves from (2,6) to new position, so (2,6) is vacated.\n\nThen I can move head to (2,6) to eat the food, if it's still there.\n\nBut the food life span: at turn 38, after eating (2,3), food at (2,6) L=8 at turn 36, after each turn decrease.\n\nTurn 36: L=8, after move L=7\n\nTurn 37: after move L=6\n\nTurn 38: after move and eat (2,3), food (2,6) L decreases to 5? Let's track food life.\n\nAt turn 36 start: both foods present, (2,3) L=3, (2,6) L=8\n\nTurn 36: I move to (4,3), no eat (2,3) not reached, so after move, both foods L decrease: (2,3) L=2, (2,6) L=7\n\nTurn 37: move to (3,3), no eat, after move, (2,3) L=1, (2,6) L=6\n\nTurn 38: move to (2,3), eat it, so (2,3) consumed, gone. Then after consume, (2,6) L decreases to 5.\n\nTurn 39: from head (2,3), I move say to (1,3), no food there, so after move, (2,6) L decreases to 4.\n\nTurn 40: move head to new position, no eat, after move (2,6) L=3.\n\nNow, after turn 40 move, (2,6) is freed, as per above.\n\nOn turn 41, I can move to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nBut at turn 41, before move, (2,6) has L=3? After turn 40 move, L=3.\n\nIf on turn 41 I move to (2,6), I can eat it.\n\nBut when I move to (2,6), it must be free and I eat.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 40, after move, (2,6) is vacated, and L=3.\n\nThen on turn 41, I move to (2,6), which is now free, has food, so eat it.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I need to make sure that from turn 39 position, I can reach (2,6) on turn 41.\n\nAfter turn 38, head at (2,3), positions as above.\n\nOn turn 39, I need to move to a cell that allows me to go to (2,6) later.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2), or L to (1,3). R to (3,3) is body, death.\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), then head at (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nThen from there, to go to (2,6), I need to go up, but (2,5) might be free, then (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has food, but currently occupied until freed.\n\nOn turn 39, if I move to (2,4), no eat, then after move, (2,6) L decreases to 4.\n\nPositions after turn 39: head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,6) is still occupied, as body segment.\n\nIn positions: S[0] (2,4), S[1] (2,3), S[2] (3,3), ..., S[11] (3,6)? Earlier list had S[11] as (2,6) before, but after turn 38, positions include (2,6) at S[11].\n\nAfter turn 38: S[0] (2,3), S[1] (3,3), S[2] (4,3), S[3] (5,3), S[4] (6,3), S[5] (6,4), S[6] (6,5), S[7] (6,6), S[8] (5,6), S[9] (4,6), S[10] (3,6), S[11] (2,6), S[12] (1,6)\n\nTurn 39: move U to (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nNo food at (2,4), so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), S[1] = old S[0] (2,3), S[2] = old S[1] (3,3), S[3] = old S[2] (4,3), ..., S[12] = old S[11] (2,6), and old S[12] (1,6) vacated.\n\nSo S[12] = (2,6), tail at (2,6).\n\nThen turn 40: move head to somewhere, say to (2,5) if possible, but (2,5) might be free.\n\n(2,5) is not in positions, so should be free.\n\nMove to (2,5), no food (assume), so after move, head (2,5), body S[1] = (2,4), S[2] = (2,3), ..., S[12] = old S[11] (3,6)? New S[1] = old head (2,4), S[2] = old S[1] (2,3), S[3] = old S[2] (3,3), ..., S[12] = old S[11] (2,6)? Old S[11] is (2,6), which was at index 11.\n\nOld positions: S[0] to S[12]\n\nNew after move: S[0] new = (2,5)\n\nS[1] new = old S[0] (2,4)\n\nS[2] new = old S[1] (2,3)\n\nS[3] new = old S[2] (3,3)\n\n...\n\nS[11] new = old S[10] (3,6)  // let's find what was at old S[10]\n\nOld S[10] = (3,6)\n\nOld S[11] = (2,6)\n\nOld S[12] = (1,6)\n\nAfter move no eat: new S[0] = (2,5)\n\nS[1] = old S[0] (2,4)\n\nS[2] = old S[1] (2,3)\n\nS[3] = old S[2] (3,3)\n\nS[4] = old S[3] (4,3)\n\n...\n\nS[11] = old S[10] (3,6)\n\nS[12] = old S[11] (2,6)  // tail at (2,6)\n\nAnd old S[12] (1,6) free.\n\nSo (2,6) is still occupied by tail.\n\nThen after this move, (2,6) has tail, so on next move, if I move head and no eat, tail moves away.\n\nTurn 41: move head from (2,5) to (2,6)? But (2,6) is occupied by tail, so if I move to (2,6), I collide with tail and die? But the rule: when head moves to a cell, if it's occupied by body except the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if I move to the tail cell, it's safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n\nIn this case, on turn 41, (2,6) is occupied by tail, so if I move to (2,6), head goes there, and since it's the tail, it doesn't collide; the tail moves to the previous position, so it's ok, and if there is food, I eat it.\n\nBut in this case, (2,6) has food, so I move to (2,6), eat the food, and since eat, tail doesn't move, so I grow.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn 41, before move, head at (2,5), positions: S[0] (2,5), S[1] (2,4), S[2] (2,3), ..., S[12] (2,6) tail.\n\nFood at (2,6) with some life span.\n\nI move to (2,6): head moves to (2,6), which is the current tail position.\n\nSince it's the tail, no collision; the head occupies it, and since there is food, I eat it (positive), so snake grows, meaning the tail doesn't move, so new head at (2,6), and the body includes the previous positions except the tail is replaced or something.\n\nAfter moving to tail cell with food: head moves to (2,6), eats food, so new head at (2,6), and the body starts from the previous head position (2,5), then previous body, and since grow, the old tail is no longer tail, but the segment is still there? When you eat, you add a new segment.\n\nStandard: when head moves to food, it consumes, and the snake grows, so the tail remains in place; no segment is removed.\n\nSo here: from positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ..., (2,6) ] with (2,6) tail.\n\nMove head to (2,6): since it's the same cell, but head is moving to it, and tail is there.\n\nAfter move: head at (2,6), and since ate, new body: the previous head (2,5) becomes first body, then the rest, and the tail (2,6) is still there, but now it's not tail? Let's list.\n\nBefore move: positions: S[0] = (2,5), S[1] = (2,4), S[2] = (2,3), S[3] = (3,3), ..., S[12] = (2,6)\n\nS[12] is tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,6) and eat: new head at (2,6), then new body: S[1] = old S[0] (2,5), S[2] = old S[1] (2,4), ..., up to S[12] = old S[11] (some position), and S[13] = old S[12] (2,6)? Since grow, we add a new segment at the end, but the old tail is included.\n\nTypically, the positions: the new head is (2,6), then the first body segment is the previous head (2,5), then the next is previous S[1] (2,4), and so on, up to previous S[11], and then the previous tail (2,6) is now a body segment? But (2,6) is where head is, it's messy.\n\nSince head moves to (2,6) which was tail, and eats, the new head is at (2,6), and the body includes all previous positions from old head to old tail, but since old tail was at (2,6), and head moved to same cell, it might be that the cell is occupied by head, and the old tail segment is removed or something.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nIn standard snake, when the head moves to a cell with food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, meaning that the cell where the tail was remains occupied, and a new segment is added at the head position.\n\nBut in this case, if head moves to the tail cell, which has food, then after move, head is at (2,6), and since it ate, the tail stays at (2,6)? But that would be same cell, impossible.\n\nPerhaps it's not possible to move to the tail cell if it has food, because of the tail reward danger rule.\n\nLet's recall the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nBut here, it's not adjacent; I'm moving directly to the tail cell.\n\nThe rule says \"adjacent to the tail\", not on the same cell.\n\nFor moving to the tail cell, it should be safe, as per the collision rule exception.\n\nBut when you eat the food on the tail cell, what happens?\n\nPerhaps the food is eaten, and since it's the tail cell, the head moves there, consumes food, and the tail does not move, so the cell is occupied by head, and the tail remains, but since tail was there, it might be that the tail segment is kept, but now it's not tail.\n\nI think it's better to assume that moving to tail cell is safe, and if food, you eat it and grow, with no immediate collision.\n\nIn this case, for (2,6), if I move to it when it's tail, I can eat it safely.\n\nBut in our plan, on turn 41, if (2,6) is tail and I move to it, I eat it.\n\nBut in the earlier turn, on turn 40, (2,6) is tail, and on turn 41 I move to it.\n\nBut to move to it, I need to be adjacent.\n\nFrom turn 40 head position.\n\nIn the sequence: after turn 40 move, head at (2,5), positions: S[0] (2,5), S[1] (2,4), ..., S[12] (2,6) tail.\n\nI am at (2,5), adjacent to tail at (2,6) vertically? (2,5) and (2,6) are adjacent vertically, same x, y differ by 1.\n\nSo head is adjacent to tail.\n\nAnd tail cell (2,6) has positive food.\n\nIf I eat it, according to the rule, it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo in this case, head at (2,5) adjacent to tail at (2,6) which has food, if I move to (2,6) to eat it, I die.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the food at (2,6) when it is on the tail cell and head is adjacent; it's dangerous.\n\nTo eat it safely, I need to move to it when it is not the tail, or when head is not adjacent, but since I have to move to it, I need to be adjacent to eat it.\n\nThe only safe way is to eat it when it is not the tail cell, but a free cell after the tail moved away.\n\nIn this case, for (2,6) food, I need to free it by having the tail move away, then move head to it when it's free.\n\nNo tail reward danger.\n\nIn the earlier plan, after freeing (2,6) on turn 40, it is free, then on turn 41 I move to it from adjacent cell, e.g. from (2,5) or (3,6) or (1,6), but (1,6) might not be free.\n\nFrom head position after turn 40.\n\nBut in our case, with the short food, we have a path to (2,3), then to free (2,6), it takes time.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 36 decision.\n\nI could consider not going for (2,3) and instead focus on freeing (2,6) or other strategies.\n\nBut (2,3) has short life, only available for 2 more turns after this, so if I don't go for it, I lose it.\n\nValue +1, so it's worth eating if possible.\n\nAnd the path seems safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (2,3) and then manage to free (2,6) later.\n\nBut with the tail danger, I need to be careful.\n\nAnother option: on turn 36, instead of moving L, move U or D to avoid potential issues.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,4).\n\nThen head at (5,4), which is above.\n\nFrom there, I can go left to (4,4), etc., but to reach (2,3) it might be too late.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,3): I need to go left and down, at least 3 moves: e.g., (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), then (2,3), but (2,3) might be gone by then.\n\nTurn 36 move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 37 move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 38 move L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 39 move D to (3,3) or to (2,4) then (2,3), but on turn 39, food at (2,3) L=1 at start turn 38? Let's track.\n\nTurn 36 start: (2,3) L=3\n\nTurn 36 move to (5,4), no eat, after move L=2\n\nTurn 37 move to (4,4), no eat, after move L=1\n\nTurn 38: if I move to (3,4), no eat, after move L=0, so (2,3) disappears before I can eat it on turn 39.\n\nIf on turn 38 I move directly to (2,3) from (4,4)? From (4,4) to (2,3) is not adjacent; I need to go to (3,4) or (4,3), etc., not direct.\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,3) by turn 38 if I move up on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (5,2), it might be worse, with obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo only by moving left on turn 36 can I eat (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nTherefore, for maximizing score, I should go for it.\n\nThen for the other food, I can plan to eat it later by freeing it.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might take time.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,6) is under body, but I can eat it sooner if I move in a way that frees it faster.\n\nFor example, if I move down or up to change the snake's shape.\n\nBut it might not be efficient.\n\nSince the tail is at (1,4), and I can move towards the tail to free space.\n\nBut let's decide for turn 36.\n\nI think moving L to (4,3) is the best to get the food.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it's \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to output a sequence.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions, but for the game, I need to specify the move for each turn until I die or something, but that's infinite.\n\nProbably, for this response, I should provide a sequence for the next few turns based on the plan.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output the actions for turns where I have a clear plan.\n\nFor turn 36, move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 37: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: move L to (2,3) and eat.\n\nThen for turn 39, from (2,3), I need to move to avoid collision and to free (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), or D to (2,2), or L to (1,3).\n\nMoving R to (3,3) is body, death.\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), then head at (2,4), and I can continue up to (2,5), etc., to be near (2,6) when it's free.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (1,3), I can go down or something.\n\nBut to free (2,6), as per earlier, it takes 4 moves from turn 38 without eating, but since I ate on turn 38, the length is longer, so it takes more moves to free (2,6).\n\nAfter turn 38 eat, positions: 13 segments, (2,6) is at index 11 (S[11]).\n\nTo make it the tail, I need to move without eating so that it becomes index 12, then 13, then when it is tail, move again to free.\n\nSince there are 13 segments, S[11] is 2 away from tail.\n\nLet k be the index of the segment at (2,6), which is 11 in 13-segment snake (indices 0 to 12).\n\nTail is at S[12].\n\nAfter one move no eat, it becomes S[12] new = old S[11], so it becomes the tail.\n\nThen after another move no eat, tail moves away.\n\nSo from turn 38, after eating, (2,6) is S[11].\n\nTurn 39: move no eat, then new positions, old S[11] becomes new S[12], so it is now tail.\n\nTurn 40: move no eat, then tail moves away, so (2,6) freed.\n\nThen on turn 41, I can move to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nAnd life span: after turn 38, (2,6) L=5\n\nAfter turn 39 move, L=4\n\nAfter turn 40 move, L=3, and (2,6) freed.\n\nTurn 41: move to (2,6), eat it.\n\nNow, from turn 38 head at (2,3), I need to move on turn 39 and 40 to positions that allow me to reach (2,6) on turn 41.\n\nFor example, on turn 39, from (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\nThen on turn 40, from (2,4), move U to (2,5)\n\nThen on turn 41, from (2,5), move to (2,6) but head is adjacent to tail if tail is near, but on turn 40, after move to (2,5), what is tail?\n\nAfter turn 39: moved to (2,4), no eat, positions: head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., and (2,6) is now tail, since old S[11] is now S[12] tail.\n\nPositions after turn 39: S[0] (2,4), S[1] (2,3), S[2] (3,3), S[3] (4,3), ..., S[11] (3,6)? Earlier: after turn 38, S[0] (2,3), S[1] (3,3), S[2] (4,3), S[3] (5,3), S[4] (6,3), S[5] (6,4), S[6] (6,5), S[7] (6,6), S[8] (5,6), S[9] (4,6), S[10] (3,6), S[11] (2,6), S[12] (1,6)\n\nTurn 39 move U to (2,4): no food, so new S[0] = (2,4), S[1] = old S[0] (2,3), S[2] = old S[1] (3,3), S[3] = old S[2] (4,3), ..., S[12] = old S[11] (2,6), and old S[12] (1,6) free.\n\nSo S[12] = (2,6), tail at (2,6).\n\nNow head at (2,4), tail at (2,6), so they are not adjacent; (2,4) and (2,6) are two apart, with (2,5) in between, which is free.\n\nThen turn 40: move U to (2,5), no food, so new positions: S[0] = (2,5), S[1] = old S[0] (2,4), S[2] = old S[1] (2,3), ..., S[12] = old S[11] (3,6)? Old S[11] is (2,6)? Old positions: S[0] (2,4), S[1] (2,3), S[2] (3,3), ..., S[11] (3,6)? Let's list indices.\n\nAfter turn 39: S[0] (2,4), S[1] (2,3), S[2] (3,3), S[3] (4,3), S[4] (5,3), S[5] (6,3), S[6] (6,4), S[7] (6,5), S[8] (6,6), S[9] (5,6), S[10] (4,6), S[11] (3,6), S[12] (2,6)  // S[11] is (3,6), S[12] is (2,6)\n\nMove to (2,5): new S[0] = (2,5), S[1] = old S[0] (2,4), S[2] = old S[1] (2,3), S[3] = old S[2] (3,3), ..., S[12] = old S[11] (3,6), and S[13] not, since no grow, so S[12] = old S[11] (3,6), and old S[12] (2,6) is vacated.\n\nSo new tail at (3,6).\n\n(2,6) is now free.\n\nThen turn 41: from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4)? But (2,4) is body, or U to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, has food, so move U to (2,6), eat it.\n\nAnd head is at (2,5), adjacent to (2,6), but (2,6) is not tail; tail is at (3,6), so no adjacency to tail, so no tail reward danger.\n\nEat safely.\n\nSimilarly, I could have moved L or D on turn 39, but U is fine.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nTherefore, for turn 36, move L to (4,3).\n\nThen for the sequence, I can provide:\n\nTurn 36: L\n\nTurn 37: L\n\nTurn 38: L (to eat food)\n\nTurn 39: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 40: U (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 41: U (to (2,6) to eat)\n\nBut I need to output for current turn and next, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can output 5 or 6 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it starts from current turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 39,40,41, it depends on the state, but based on plan.\n\nTo be safe, I can output up to turn 41.\n\nBut turn 41 is t1+5, since t1=36.\n\nt1=36, so turns 36 to 41 is 6 turns.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if moving D on turn 36 is better, but I think L is best to get the food.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not in the path.\n\nAlso, on turn 37, moving to (3,3), (3,3) is free, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating the positive food at (2,3) due to its short life span (3 turns remaining at turn 36), and then position the snake to safely eat the positive food at (2,6) after freeing it from under the body. The food at (2,3) must be eaten by turn 38 to avoid disappearance, and the path to it is safe and direct. After eating (2,3), I will maneuver to free (2,6) by moving without eating for two turns, allowing the tail to move away, and then eat it on turn 41. This sequence avoids collisions, walls, and the tail reward danger.\n\n### Key Planning Points:\n- **Food at (2,3)**: Life span 3 at turn 36, so it disappears after turn 38. Eating it on turn 38 is feasible by moving left three times from the current head position (5,3).\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Life span 8 at turn 36, so it remains until turn 43. It is under the snake body and must be freed by moving the tail away. Freeing it takes two moves without eating (turns 39-40), then eating on turn 41 is safe and avoids tail reward danger.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Current head direction is left (L), so reverse move (right) is invalid. Moves must avoid walls (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (3,1)) and body collisions.\n- **Collision Risks**: After eating at (2,3) on turn 38, moving right to (3,3) is fatal as it is the body. Moving up or down is safe. On turn 41, eating (2,6) is safe as it is free and not the tail cell when approached.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: \n  - Turns 36-38: Move left to eat (2,3) on turn 38.\n  - Turns 39-40: Move up to position near (2,6) and free the cell.\n  - Turn 41: Move up to eat (2,6).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 36**: Move left (L) to (4,3). This starts the path to (2,3) and avoids immediate risks. (Current direction L allows this; reverse R is invalid.)\n- **Turn 37**: Move left (L) to (3,3). Continues the safe path to (2,3); (3,3) is free.\n- **Turn 38**: Move left (L) to (2,3) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases). (2,3) is free, and life span allows eating here.\n- **Turn 39**: Move up (U) to (2,4). Positions the snake to free (2,6); avoids body collision (right to (3,3) is fatal). (2,4) is free.\n- **Turn 40**: Move up (U) to (2,5). Continues freeing (2,6); after this move, (2,6) is vacated (tail moves away). (2,5) is free.\n- **Turn 41**: Move up (U) to (2,6) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases). (2,6) is now free, and head is not adjacent to tail when moving, avoiding tail reward danger.\n\nThis plan eats both positive foods, adds 2 to the score, and ensures survival by avoiding walls, obstacles, and collisions. Beyond turn 41, the snake can explore for more food, but this sequence maximizes immediate opportunities safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: L (left)  \nTurn 37: L (left)  \nTurn 38: L (left)  \nTurn 39: U (up)  \nTurn 40: U (up)  \nTurn 41: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (1,1) to (6,6) because x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Similarly for y.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So the snake has 12 segments. Head is at (4,3) and tail at (1,5).\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 2\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. Life span is how many turns left, including the current turn, so for (2,3), life span 2, meaning it disappears after turn 38? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t=37, life span N means it will disappear after N turns, so if N=2, it will be gone after turn 38. Turn 37: countdown to 2, then turn 38: countdown to 1, then after that, gone. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 7, so disappears after turn 43.\n\n(1,2) life span 10, disappears after turn 46.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and ensure survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders, so (1,1) to (1,6) left border, (6,1) to (6,6) right? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nBody: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nTail: (1,5)\n\nSo the snake is long, 12 segments. It's coiled around, with head at (4,3), going left to (5,3)? No: positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (2,6) -> (1,6) -> (1,5)\n\nSo the snake head is at (4,3), moving left (direction L), so from (4,3), moving left would go to (3,3), but (3,3) is not occupied? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nOccupied cells by snake:\n\n(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nNow, food at:\n\n(2,3) - value 1, life 2\n\n(2,6) - value 1, life 7\n\n(1,2) - value 1, life 10\n\n(2,6) is a food position, but (2,6) is also occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (2,6) is part of the body, segment before tail. Positions: index 9 is (2,6), then (1,6), then (1,5).\n\nFood at (2,6) is listed. But (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake body.\n\nSpecial rule: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (2,6), it's under the snake body now, so to eat it, the snake needs to move so that (2,6) is vacated, then head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nHead direction is L, so from (4,3), moving left to (3,3) is possible? (3,3) is not listed as occupied, and not wall.\n\nPossible moves from current position (4,3):\n\nHead at (4,3), direction L (left).\n\nCan move U (up to (4,4)), D (down to (4,2)), L (left to (3,3)), R (right to (5,3)) but (5,3) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: since direction is L, cannot move R (right) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n\nDirections: U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y)\n\nCurrent direction L, so opposite is R, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- L to (3,3): is (3,3) free? Not occupied by snake, not wall. Snake occupied: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), etc., no (3,3). Walls: border walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is within 1-6,1-6, and no internal wall, (3,1) is wall, but (3,3) is fine. So (3,3) is empty.\n\n- U to (4,4): (4,4) not in snake positions? Snake: ... (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), ... no (4,4), so empty.\n\n- D to (4,2): (4,2) not occupied, not wall. Walls: y=0 is bottom, so y=2 is fine, x=4, internal obstacle at (3,1), not affecting (4,2). So empty.\n\n- R to (5,3): but (5,3) is occupied by body, second segment, so moving there would cause collision. Also, cannot move opposite direction.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFood available:\n\n(2,3) at (2,3) with life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 38 or it disappears. Turn 37 and 38 are opportunities.\n\n(2,6) at (2,6) with life 7, so can be eaten later, but it's under snake body now.\n\n(1,2) at (1,2) with life 10, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, (2,6) is currently occupied, so need to move body away.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can eat (2,3) soon.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), head at (4,3), same row, y=3.\n\nTo reach (2,3), need to go left twice: to (3,3) then to (2,3).\n\nBut from (4,3) to (3,3) left, then to (2,3) left again.\n\nBut after moving to (3,3), direction would be L, so can move L again to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is a food cell.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nFirst, on turn 37, move to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 38, move to (2,3) to eat it.\n\nBut when we eat, snake grows, so new tail is added, but since we eat, length increases.\n\nNow, when we move to (2,3) on turn 38, the current tail is at (1,5), which will move.\n\nLet's simulate the snake movement.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (4,3), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — 12 segments.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3) on turn 37:\n\nNew head at (3,3), body segments: the tail moves, so (1,5) is removed, and new segment added at head? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail is removed.\n\nSo after move to (3,3): new positions: head (3,3), then (4,3) [previous head], then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). Tail was (1,5), which is gone, and (1,6) becomes the new tail? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (4,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (2,6), 10: (1,6), 11: (1,5)\n\nAfter move left to (3,3): new head at (3,3). Then segment 1 moves to previous segment 0 position: (4,3). Segment 2 moves to previous seg1: (5,3), and so on, down to segment 11 moves to previous seg10 position: (1,6). Previous seg10 is (1,6), so segment 11 (tail) moves to (1,6), but since it's moving, the cell (1,5) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). And (1,5) is no longer occupied.\n\nNow, on turn 38, move to (2,3) to eat food.\n\nMove from (3,3) to (2,3) left.\n\nNew head at (2,3), and since we eat food, the snake grows, so tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), head at (2,3), and we eat the food, so length increases by one.\n\nThe body: segment 1 moves to previous head position (3,3), segment 2 to (4,3), ..., segment 11 to previous segment 10 position: (2,6)? Previous positions before move: head (3,3), body (4,3) to (1,6).\n\nAfter move to (2,3): new head (2,3), then body: (3,3) [previous head], (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), and since we eat, add a new segment at the previous tail position, which was (1,6), so new tail at (1,6)? Let's see.\n\nBefore move on turn 38: positions: head (3,3), segments: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — 12 segments, tail (1,6).\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3): new head (2,3), then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one: so the first body segment goes to (3,3), second to (4,3), ..., the last body segment, which was (1,6), moves to where? The segment that was at (1,6) moves to the position of the previous segment 10, but segment 10 is (2,6)? Indices: let's number from head.\n\nBefore move: position 0: (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (4,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (2,6), 11: (1,6) — tail is index 11 at (1,6).\n\nAfter head moves to (2,3): new position 0: (2,3)\n\nThen position 1 moves to old position 0: (3,3)\n\nPosition 2 moves to old position 1: (4,3)\n\n...\n\nPosition 11 moves to old position 10: (2,6)\n\nSince we eat food, we add a new segment at the old tail position, so new position 12: (1,6)\n\nSo snake now: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — 13 segments.\n\nNow, is this safe? After eating, the snake is at (2,3), and body includes (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,6) is still there, and food at (2,6) is under the body, but we didn't eat it.\n\nNow, the issue: after moving to (2,3), the head is at (2,3), and the tail is at (1,6), but (2,6) is occupied by the body.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,6), it is still under the body, so to eat it, we need to move the body away.\n\nBut life span is 7, so we have time.\n\nAnother food at (1,2).\n\nBut first, back to turn 37.\n\nIf we go directly to eat (2,3), on turn 37 move L to (3,3), then turn 38 move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nWhen we are at (2,3), the cell (1,3) might be a possible move, but (1,3) is not occupied now, but let's see the surroundings.\n\nAlso, we have to avoid collisions.\n\nBut more importantly, there is a special rule: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIf the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, when we eat at (2,3), the tail is at (1,6), which is not adjacent to (2,3). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,3) and (1,6) are not adjacent; different x and y.\n\n(2,3) to (1,3) would be adjacent left, but (1,3) is empty.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4) up, (2,2) down, (1,3) left, (3,3) right but occupied.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nBut we should think about the food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has food with value 1, and it's under the body at position (2,6), which in the current state is occupied by the snake.\n\nIn the new position after eating (2,3), (2,6) is still occupied by the body.\n\nTo eat (2,6), we need to move so that (2,6) is vacated and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is free.\n\nBut life span of (2,3) is short, only 2 turns, so if we don't eat it now, it might disappear.\n\nTurn 37: if we don't move towards it, and say move U or D, then on turn 38 it might be gone if we don't act.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 37: after turn 37, life span decreases to 1, then after turn 38, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n\nBut to eat on turn 37, we need to be at (2,3) on turn 37, but head is at (4,3), so we can't reach it in one move, since only adjacent moves.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (2,3) is two cells away, so need at least two moves.\n\nOn turn 37, we can move to (3,3), then on turn 38 to (2,3) to eat before it disappears.\n\nIf we don't move to (3,3) on turn 37, we might not be able to eat it.\n\nFor example, if we move U to (4,4) on turn 37, then on turn 38, we can go to (4,3) or (3,4) or (5,4), but from (4,4), to reach (2,3) in one move? Not possible, (2,3) is not adjacent to (4,4); adjacent are (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4).\n\n(4,3) is the previous position, but now might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4) on turn 37, snake positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), etc., down to (1,6), and tail moves to (1,6)? Previous tail (1,5) moves to (1,6).\n\n(1,5) was tail, after move, it moves to previous position of segment before tail.\n\nAfter move U: new head (4,4), body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., (2,6), (1,6), and (1,5) gone.\n\n(2,3) is still there, but to reach (2,3) from (4,4), it takes multiple moves, like down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then left to (2,3), but by then it might be gone; on turn 38, if we are at (4,4), move to (4,3) on turn 38, but (4,3) is now part of body? After turn 37 move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nOn turn 38, from (4,4), we can move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by the body segment, so moving there would cause collision. Cannot move to a body cell.\n\nSimilarly, move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5) or R to (5,4).\n\n(4,3) is occupied, so cannot move down.\n\nTo reach (2,3), it would take at least two more moves from (4,4), but on turn 38, if we move, say, L to (3,4), then on turn 39, we can move down to (3,3), then to (2,3) on turn 40, but by turn 39, the food at (2,3) is gone because life span 2 at turn 37: turn 37, life 2; after turn 37, life 1; after turn 38, life 0, gone. So it can only be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n\nOn turn 38, if we are not at (3,3), we can't eat it, because from other positions, we can't reach (2,3) in one move on turn 38.\n\nFor example, on turn 38, if we are at (4,4), we can move to (3,4) or (4,5) or (5,4), but not to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is not adjacent to (4,4), so impossible to eat on turn 38 if not at (3,3) on turn 37.\n\nSimilarly, only if we are at (3,3) on turn 37, we can eat on turn 38.\n\nIf we don't move to (3,3) on turn 37, we miss the food at (2,3).\n\nNow, is eating (2,3) beneficial? It gives +1 score and grows snake.\n\nBut there might be risks or better options.\n\nWe have other food.\n\nBut (2,3) is about to disappear, so we should consider eating it if possible.\n\nNow, moving to (3,3) on turn 37 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if there are dangers.\n\nFrom (4,3), moving L to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is empty, as we said.\n\nThen from (3,3), on turn 38, we can move L to (2,3) to eat, or other directions.\n\nBut if we don't move to (2,3), we might not get another chance for that food.\n\nWe could move U or D from (3,3), but then we lose the food.\n\nSo probably, we should go for it.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is currently under the body, and in the position after moving to (3,3), (2,6) is still occupied, as we saw earlier.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3) on turn 37, positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\n(2,6) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nFood at (2,6) is there, but under snake.\n\nTo eat it, we need to move so that the body leaves (2,6), then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (2,6) will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if on turn 38 we move from (3,3) to (2,3), as before, then after eating, positions include (2,6) as part of body, so still occupied.\n\nThen later, when the snake moves, if the segment that was at (2,6) moves away, it might be vacated.\n\nBut the snake is long, and we need to coordinate.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with tail reward danger if head is near tail and tail has food.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on immediate action.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but we are at y=3, not near yet.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, let's consider other moves from (4,3).\n\nInstead of L, we could move U or D.\n\nFor example, move U to (4,4) on turn 37.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — tail (1,6)\n\nThen on turn 38, from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, so cannot, L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nSay move L to (3,4).\n\nThen head to (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), etc., down to (1,6), tail moves to (1,6)? Previous tail (1,6) moves to (2,6) or something.\n\nBefore move: positions head (4,4), body (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nAfter move to (3,4): new head (3,4), body: (4,4) [old head], (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), and tail (1,6) moves to old position of previous tail segment, but since no eat, tail moves: the segment that was at (1,6) moves to (2,6)? Indices: position 0: (4,4), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), ..., 11: (1,6)\n\nAfter head to (3,4): new 0: (3,4)\n\n1: old 0 = (4,4)\n\n2: old 1 = (4,3)\n\n3: old 2 = (5,3)\n\n...\n\n11: old 10 = (2,6)\n\nAnd old 11 (1,6) is gone.\n\nSo now positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — 12 segments, tail (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is now the tail, and it has food? Food is at (2,6), but now (2,6) is the tail cell.\n\nThe food at (2,6) is under the tail now.\n\nIf the head moves to (2,6), it could eat it, but tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, head at (3,4), tail at (2,6). Are they adjacent? (3,4) to (2,6): dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y difference 1.\n\n(3,4) adjacent: (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4) — (4,4) is occupied, (3,5) might be free, (3,3) free, (2,4) free.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), not adjacent to (3,4).\n\nTo eat (2,6), we need to move head to (2,6), but currently at (3,4), we can move to (2,4) or (3,5) or (4,4) or (3,3), but not directly to (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,4), to (2,6) is not adjacent, so need multiple moves.\n\nBut the food at (2,6) has life span 7, so time.\n\nIf we go to (2,4), then we are closer.\n\nBut (2,6) is tail, so if we move and the tail moves, it might vacate.\n\nBut let's go back to the first plan.\n\nI think eating the short-life food (2,3) is important to not miss the point.\n\nMoreover, it's safe to do so.\n\nBut after eating (2,3), we are at (2,3) with a longer snake.\n\nThen we need to plan next moves.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2) and (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is under body, and after eating (2,3), it's still occupied, as in our simulation.\n\nTo eat (2,6), we need to vacate it.\n\nThe cell (2,6) is currently occupied by a body segment; after eating (2,3), it's position (2,6) in the list.\n\nAs the snake moves, that segment will move away if we don't stay.\n\nFor example, if from (2,3) we move up or down or left.\n\nBut left to (1,3) might be possible.\n\n(1,3) is not occupied, I think.\n\nAfter being at (2,3), we can move to (1,3), (2,4), (2,2), or (3,3) but (3,3) occupied.\n\n(3,3) is occupied by the next segment.\n\nIn positions after eating: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but occupied, cannot.\n\nAlso, walls: x=1 is left border, but x=1 is playable since walls at x=0, so (1,3) is valid.\n\nSimilarly, y=2, etc.\n\nNow, moving L to (1,3) might be good to go towards (1,2) food.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is down from (1,3).\n\nLife span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut for (2,6) food, we need to free it.\n\nSince (2,6) is occupied, and it will only be free when the segment moves away.\n\nIn the current body, (2,6) is the position before the tail in some cases, but after changes.\n\nPerhaps we can move in a way that the tail moves over (2,6) and vacates it.\n\nFor example, if we move so that the tail leaves (2,6), then head can come.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate for now.\n\nSince we have to think 5+ turns ahead, let's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 37: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: move L to (2,3) to eat food. Score +1, length 13.\n\nNow at (2,3), head.\n\nThen from here, we can move to (1,3) on turn 39, for example.\n\nMove L to (1,3).\n\nThen positions: from head (2,3), move to (1,3), no eat, so new head (1,3), body: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), ..., up to (1,6), and tail moves away from (1,6)? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions head (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,3): new head (1,3), then body: (2,3) [old head], (3,3), (4,3), ..., (2,6), (1,6), and the last segment (1,6) moves to? Position 12 was (1,6), moves to old position 11: (2,6)\n\nOld positions: 0: (2,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (2,6), 12: (1,6)\n\nAfter head to (1,3): new 0: (1,3)\n\n1: old 0 = (2,3)\n\n2: old 1 = (3,3)\n\n...\n\n11: old 10 = (3,6)\n\n12: old 11 = (2,6)\n\nAnd old 12 (1,6) is gone.\n\nSo now snake: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — tail (2,6)\n\nNotice that (2,6) is now the tail, and it has food.\n\nBut the food is still under the tail.\n\nHead at (1,3), tail at (2,6).\n\nTo eat the food at (2,6), we need head to move there when it's free.\n\nBut currently (2,6) is occupied by tail.\n\nWhen we move, the tail will move, so (2,6) might be vacated if tail moves away.\n\nFor example, on turn 40, from (1,3), we can move down to (1,2) to eat the food there? (1,2) has food.\n\nMove D to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is food, so eat it.\n\nNew head (1,2), body: since eat, add new segment, so positions: head (1,2), then (1,3) [old head], (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), (2,6), and new tail at old tail position? Before move: head (1,3), body (2,3) to (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,2): new head (1,2), body: (1,3) [old head], (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,6), and since eat, add new segment at old tail position, which was (2,6), so new position at (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) has food, and we are adding a segment there, but we eat the food, so the cell (1,2) had food, we eat it, so we grow, adding a segment at the previous tail position.\n\nPrevious tail was at (2,6), so new segment at (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) already has food, but we are not eating at (2,6), we are eating at (1,2).\n\nSo the food at (2,6) is still there, under the new segment or something.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — and since we ate, we add a new segment at the old tail position, which was (2,6), so new position at (2,6), but (2,6) is already occupied? No, in the list, before adding, the last body position is (2,6), then we add a new segment at (2,6), but that would be two segments at same cell? I think I confused.\n\nStandard: when you eat, you add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving.\n\nBefore moving on turn 40: positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., up to (2,6) as tail? In previous, after turn 39, positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — so tail is (2,6).\n\nNow, move head to (1,2) to eat food there.\n\nNew head at (1,2), then the body segments move: position 1 moves to old head (1,3), position 2 moves to old position 1 (2,3), and so on, position 12 (tail) moves to old position 11: (3,6)? Let's index.\n\nPositions: 0: (1,3), 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,6), 9: (5,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (2,6) — tail index 12 at (2,6)\n\nAfter head moves to (1,2): new head (1,2)\n\nThen body: 1: old 0 = (1,3)\n\n2: old 1 = (2,3)\n\n3: old 2 = (3,3)\n\n...\n\n12: old 11 = (3,6)\n\nAnd since we eat, add new segment at old tail position: old 12 was (2,6), so new position 13: (2,6)\n\nBut (2,6) has food, and we are adding a segment there, but we didn't eat at (2,6), we ate at (1,2). The food at (2,6) is still there, but now there is a snake segment at (2,6), so it's covered.\n\nTo eat (2,6), we need to move so that the segment at (2,6) moves away, then head moves there.\n\nBut in this case, after adding, (2,6) is occupied by the new segment.\n\nPerhaps it's messy.\n\nBack to turn 38 after eating (2,3).\n\nAt (2,3), we can instead move down to (2,2) or up to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,6).\n\nSince (2,6) is occupied, and it's not the tail yet, we can move the snake in a way that the body leaves (2,6) free.\n\nFor example, if we move up from (2,3) to (2,4), then to (2,5), etc., but that might take time.\n\nThe tail is at (1,6), which is far.\n\nPerhaps we should go towards the food at (1,2) first, since it's closer and not under body.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), head at (2,3) after eating, so we can move down to (2,2) or left to (1,3) then down to (1,2).\n\n(1,3) might be free.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) on turn 38, positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo occupied: all these cells.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,4) except (1,6) and (1,5) gone, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) free? (1,6) occupied, but (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5) not occupied, etc.\n\n(2,6) occupied.\n\nFood at (1,2) is free, so we can eat it.\n\nFrom (2,3), we can move D to (2,2) on turn 39, but (2,2) is not food, (1,2) is food.\n\nTo reach (1,2), we can move L to (1,3) first, then D to (1,2).\n\nOr directly? From (2,3) to (1,2) is not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\nMove to (1,3) then to (1,2).\n\nOn turn 39: from (2,3) move L to (1,3)\n\nAs I did earlier, then positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,6), (1,6) gone, tail at (2,6)\n\nThen on turn 40, from (1,3) move D to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen grow.\n\nBut the food at (2,6) is still there, under tail at (2,6).\n\nThen we need to move so that the tail moves away from (2,6).\n\nFor example, if we move from (1,2) to (1,1) or (2,2) or (1,3) but (1,3) occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), head at (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), etc., tail at (2,6) or something.\n\nBefore eating at (1,2): positions head (1,3), body (2,3) to (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,2) and eat: new head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), (2,6), and add new segment at old tail position (2,6), so new tail at (2,6)\n\nSo (2,6) is still occupied.\n\nTo vacate (2,6), we need the snake to move so that the segment at (2,6) moves to another position.\n\nFor example, if we move right or up from (1,2), but let's see.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) has life span 7, and we are at turn 38, after turn 38, life span decreases to 6, then 5, etc., so we have until turn 43 to eat it.\n\nTurn 37: food (2,6) life 7, after turn 37: life 6, after turn 38: life 5, ..., after turn 43: life 0, gone. So can be eaten on turns 37 to 43 inclusive.\n\nBut since it's under body, we have time to free it.\n\nFor now, I think the best is to eat the available foods.\n\nSo plan for turn 37: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: move L to (2,3) to eat food at (2,3)\n\nThen turn 39: move L to (1,3) to go towards (1,2)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (1,2) to eat food at (1,2)\n\nThen after that, deal with (2,6).\n\nBut after turn 40, we have eaten two foods, score +2, length 14.\n\nThen at (1,2), head.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,3) but occupied, D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, cannot, R to (2,2).\n\nSo only D to (1,1) or R to (2,2), or U to (1,3) occupied, cannot.\n\nU to (1,3) is occupied by body, so cannot.\n\nL to (0,2) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) might be free, not occupied.\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nSay move R to (2,2) on turn 41.\n\nThen head to (2,2), body moves, tail might move.\n\nBut we need to free (2,6).\n\nThe segment at (2,6) will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if we keep moving, eventually the tail will move from (2,6) if it's not the tail, but in some positions it is the tail.\n\nIn the state after turn 40, tail is at (2,6), so when we move, the tail moves away, vacating (2,6).\n\nAfter eating at (1,2) on turn 40, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — and since we ate, we added a new segment at the old tail position, which was (2,6), so new segment at (2,6), so positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — 14 segments, all positions occupied as above, with tail at (2,6).\n\nNow, on turn 41, we move, say, R to (2,2).\n\nFirst, move head to (2,2), no eat, so new head (2,2), then body: (1,2) [old head], (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), (2,6), and the tail segment moves to old position of previous: position 13 was (2,6), moves to old position 12: (3,6)\n\nOld positions: 0: (1,2), 1: (1,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,5), 9: (6,6), 10: (5,6), 11: (4,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (2,6)\n\nAfter head to (2,2): new 0: (2,2)\n\n1: old 0 = (1,2)\n\n2: old 1 = (1,3)\n\n3: old 2 = (2,3)\n\n4: old 3 = (3,3)\n\n...\n\n13: old 12 = (3,6)\n\nAnd old 13 (2,6) is gone, so (2,6) is vacated.\n\nNow, the food at (2,6) is still there, and we just vacated it, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut head is now at (2,2), and (2,6) is at distance.\n\nWe can move towards it.\n\nBut life span is decreasing; after turn 41, life span of (2,6) is... let's track.\n\nAt turn 37, life 7\n\nAfter turn 37: life 6\n\nAfter turn 38: life 5\n\nAfter turn 39: life 4\n\nAfter turn 40: life 3\n\nAfter turn 41: life 2\n\nAfter turn 42: life 1\n\nAfter turn 43: life 0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 41, after moving, life span is 2, meaning it can be eaten on turn 41 or 42.\n\nBut on turn 41, we are at (2,2), and (2,6) is at (2,6), same x, different y.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,6) is 4 cells apart, so need at least 4 moves to reach, but we have only until turn 42 to eat.\n\nOn turn 41, we can move U to (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied? After move to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)? From above: new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\n(2,3) is occupied, so from (2,2), we can move D to (2,1), U to (2,3) occupied, cannot, L to (1,2) occupied, cannot, R to (3,2).\n\nOnly D to (2,1) or R to (3,2), assuming free.\n\n(2,1) and (3,2) should be free.\n\nMove to (3,2) for example.\n\nThen still far from (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6) in time, we need to be closer earlier.\n\nIn this plan, by turn 41, we are at (2,2), and (2,6) is far, and we can't reach it by turn 42.\n\nTurn 42: from wherever we are, say (3,2), move to (3,3) or (4,2) or (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, internal obstacle.\n\n(3,1) is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves U to (3,3) but occupied? After previous, positions might have (3,3) occupied.\n\nNot easy to reach (2,6) quickly.\n\nTherefore, in this sequence, we might miss the food at (2,6) because we didn't prioritize freeing it early.\n\nTo eat (2,6), we need to have the head near when it is vacated.\n\nIn the initial state, after turn 37 move to (3,3), (2,6) is occupied.\n\nThen if on turn 38, instead of moving to (2,3) to eat, we move elsewhere to free (2,6) sooner.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) on turn 38, move U to (3,4) or D to (3,2), etc.\n\nThen the snake moves, and (2,6) might be vacated later.\n\nBut it's uncertain.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is under the body, and we have other food, perhaps we can let it go if not feasible.\n\nBut it's a point, so we should try to get it.\n\nAnother idea: from initial position, don't go for (2,3), but go towards freeing (2,6).\n\nBut (2,3) is about to disappear, so missing it might be worse.\n\n(2,3) life span 2, so must eat now or never.\n\nWhereas (2,6) has more time.\n\nSo probably better to eat (2,3) first.\n\nThen for (2,6), after eating (2,3), at (2,3), instead of going to (1,3), we can move down to (2,2) or up to (2,4) to start moving towards the area.\n\nBut (2,6) is at y=6, so up.\n\nMove U to (2,4) on turn 39.\n\nFrom (2,3) after eating, move U to (2,4).\n\nThen positions: new head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) -- after move, tail moves to (2,6) or something.\n\nBefore move: head (2,3), body (3,3) to (1,6)\n\nAfter move U to (2,4): new head (2,4), body: (2,3) [old head], (3,3), (4,3), ..., (2,6), (1,6), and tail moves to (2,6)? Old tail (1,6) moves to old position 11: (2,6)\n\nPositions: 0: (2,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (2,6), 12: (1,6)\n\nAfter head to (2,4): new 0: (2,4)\n\n1: old 0 = (2,3)\n\n2: old 1 = (3,3)\n\n...\n\n12: old 11 = (2,6)\n\nAnd old 12 (1,6) gone.\n\nSo now head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), (2,6) -- tail at (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is tail with food.\n\nThen on turn 40, from (2,4), we can move U to (2,5), for example.\n\nThen to (2,6) to eat, but tail reward danger.\n\nHead at (2,4), tail at (2,6), are they adjacent? (2,4) to (2,6) difference in y is 2, not adjacent; adjacent would be (2,5), (2,3), (1,4), (3,4).\n\n(2,5) might be free.\n\nIf we move to (2,5) on turn 40, then head at (2,5), tail at (2,6), which are adjacent.\n\nThen the cell (2,6) has food, and tail is there.\n\nIf we move to (2,6) on turn 41, we would eat the food, but since head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the new tail grows at the position, but head is there, collision.\n\nSo we must not eat it when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nIn this case, at (2,5), head adjacent to tail at (2,6), and (2,6) has food, so if we move to (2,6), we die.\n\nTherefore, we should not move to (2,5) if we want to eat (2,6) safely.\n\nInstead, we need to move away or something to break adjacency.\n\nBut the food life is short.\n\nFrom (2,4), we can move to (1,4) or (3,4) instead of U.\n\nThen later, when the tail moves, (2,6) might be vacated.\n\nFor example, move L to (1,4) on turn 40.\n\nThen head to (1,4), body moves, tail at (2,6) moves to old position, say (3,6) or something.\n\nBefore move: head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,4): new head (1,4), body: (2,4) [old head], (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), (2,6), and tail moves to (3,6)? Old tail (2,6) moves to old position 11: (3,6)\n\nPositions: 0: (2,4), 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,6), 9: (5,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (2,6)\n\nAfter head to (1,4): new 0: (1,4)\n\n1: old 0 = (2,4)\n\n2: old 1 = (2,3)\n\n3: old 2 = (3,3)\n\n...\n\n12: old 11 = (3,6)\n\nAnd old 12 (2,6) gone, so (2,6) vacated.\n\nNow, food at (2,6) is free, and head at (1,4), which is not adjacent, so we can move to (2,6) on turn 41 if possible.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (2,6) is not adjacent, so need to move to (2,4) or (1,5) or (1,3), etc.\n\n(2,4) is now occupied by body? After move, positions have (2,4) as body segment.\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6)\n\n(2,6) is free and has food.\n\nLife span: on turn 40, after vacating, life span of food (2,6) is, from turn 37 life 7, after 37:6, 38:5, 39:4, 40:3, so on turn 40, after action, life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 41,42,43.\n\nOn turn 41, head at (1,4), we can move to (1,5), (1,3), (2,4) but occupied, or (0,4) wall.\n\nSo move to (1,5) or (1,3).\n\nTo reach (2,6), from (1,4) move to (1,5), then to (2,5), then to (2,6) on turn 43, but life span on turn 41: after turn 40, life 3, so on turn 41, life 3, after turn 41: life 2, after turn 42: life 1, after turn 43: life 0 gone. So can eat on turn 41,42,43.\n\nFrom (1,4) on turn 41, move to (1,5) (assume free), then on turn 42 move to (2,5), then on turn 43 move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nPossible.\n\nBut we also have food at (1,2) to consider.\n\nBut (1,2) has life 10, so later.\n\nIn this case, for the immediate action, to maximize, we should go for (2,3) first.\n\nSo for turn 37, move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 38 move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 39, we can move U to (2,4) to start the process for (2,6).\n\nTurn 39: from (2,3) move U to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 40: from (2,4) move to (1,4) as above to vacate (2,6)\n\nThen turn 41: from (1,4) move to (1,5)\n\nTurn 42: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 43: move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nAnd during this, we can eat (1,2) later.\n\nBut on turn 41, from (1,4), we could move down to (1,3) or something to get (1,2), but let's not complicate.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from 37, at least 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 37: L\n\nTurn 38: L to eat (2,3)\n\nThen for turn 39, I need to choose.\n\nSince the question is to output actions for multiple turns, I think for 5 turns: 37 to 41 or something.\n\nBut the food at (1,2) is not eaten in this, but it's ok.\n\nPerhaps include it.\n\nBut for now, let's finalize.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but we are not near it.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nSo I think for turn 37, move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 38, move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 39, move U to (2,4) to go up.\n\nThen turn 40, move L to (1,4) to vacate (2,6)\n\nThen turn 41, move U to (1,5) to continue to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 42, move R to (2,5)\n\nTurn 43, move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nBut turn 43 is beyond 5 turns from 37.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for a few turns.\n\nThe format is to box the actions from turn t1 onwards for several turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nFor turn 37, action is L.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to specify.\n\nBut the actions depend on the state, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can assume.\n\nTo be safe, for turn 37: L\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nThen for turn 39, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) towards (1,2), but let's see.\n\nI think moving U to (2,4) is fine to free (2,6).\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide 5 turns: 37 to 41.\n\nTurn 37: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 38: L to (2,3) eat\n\nTurn 39: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 40: L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 41: U to (1,5)\n\nThen later to (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nBut in this, we eat (2,3) on turn 38, and set up for (2,6), and (1,2) can be eaten later.\n\nSince (1,2) has long life, it's ok.\n\nAt turn 41, head at (1,5), we can move to (1,6) or (2,5), etc.\n\nBut for the output, I think it's acceptable.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 37: L\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: L\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 40 L to (1,4) from (2,4), which is valid.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves considering the current state and thinking at least 5 turns ahead. The key priorities are:\n- Eat the positive food at (2,3) before it disappears (life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 38).\n- Avoid missing high-value opportunities and manage risks, especially with the food at (2,6) under the snake's body.\n- Ensure the snake does not collide with itself, walls, or internal obstacles.\n- After eating (2,3), position the snake to safely eat the food at (2,6) by vacating the cell and moving the head there, considering the Tail Reward Danger rule.\n- The food at (1,2) has a long life span (10 turns) and can be eaten later, so it is not urgent.\n\n### Plan Summary (Turns 37-41)\n- **Turn 37**: Move left (L) to (3,3) to position for eating (2,3) on the next turn.\n- **Turn 38**: Move left (L) to (2,3) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 13).\n- **Turn 39**: Move up (U) to (2,4) to start navigating toward the area near (2,6) and avoid boxing the snake in.\n- **Turn 40**: Move left (L) to (1,4) to vacate the (2,6) cell by moving the tail away, making the food accessible.\n- **Turn 41**: Move up (U) to (1,5) to continue toward (2,6) for a future eat (planned for turn 43, beyond this sequence).\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n- **Turn 37 (Current State)**: Snake head at (4,3), direction left. Possible moves: U (to (4,4)), D (to (4,2)), or L (to (3,3)). Moving L to (3,3) is optimal to reach (2,3) quickly. Missing (2,3) would lose a point as it disappears after turn 38. (3,3) is safe (no collision).\n- **Turn 38**: Head at (3,3), direction left. Move L to (2,3) to eat the food. This must be done now, as (2,3) disappears after this turn. Eating here increases length to 13. No immediate risks: (2,3) is not adjacent to the tail (at (1,6)), so no Tail Reward Danger.\n- **Turn 39**: Head at (2,3) after eating. Possible moves: U (to (2,4)), D (to (2,2)), or L (to (1,3)). Moving U to (2,4) is chosen to:\n  - Avoid moving down toward (1,2) prematurely (life span 10 allows delay).\n  - Position closer to (2,6) for future eating.\n  - (2,4) is safe (no collision).\n- **Turn 40**: Head at (2,4), direction up. Possible moves: U (to (2,5)), L (to (1,4)), or R (to (3,4)). Moving L to (1,4) vacates (2,6) by shifting the tail:\n  - Before move: tail is at (2,6) with food under it.\n  - After move to (1,4): tail moves to (3,6), vacating (2,6). This makes the food at (2,6) accessible on future turns. (1,4) is safe.\n- **Turn 41**: Head at (1,4), direction left. Possible moves: U (to (1,5)), D (to (1,3)), or R (to (2,4)) (but (2,4) is occupied, so invalid). Moving U to (1,5) continues the path toward (2,5) and (2,6), setting up to eat (2,6) by turn 43. (1,5) is safe and avoids Tail Reward Danger (head not adjacent to tail at (3,6)).\n\n### Risk Assessment and Long-Term\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Vacated on turn 40, with life span 3 remaining (can be eaten on turns 41-43). Moving to (1,5) on turn 41 allows reaching (2,5) on turn 42 and (2,6) on turn 43 to eat safely (head not adjacent to tail when eating).\n- **Food at (1,2)**: Can be eaten after turn 41 by moving down from (1,5) or similar; life span 10 allows flexibility.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles (e.g., (3,1)), and body collisions. Tail Reward Danger is managed by not moving head adjacent to tail when tail has food.\n- **Survival Focus**: The sequence keeps the snake in open spaces, avoiding tight corners (e.g., not moving down toward (1,2) early, which could risk trapping). After turn 41, the snake can navigate to eat (1,2) and explore safely.\n\nThis plan secures 1 point from (2,3) and positions for a second point from (2,6), with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: L (left)  \nTurn 38: L (left)  \nTurn 39: U (up)  \nTurn 40: L (left)  \nTurn 41: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 38. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the edges and (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,3), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). So the snake is long—12 segments. Head direction is left, so it was moving left to (3,3) from (4,3), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at all borders, so cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x, and also (3,1) is an obstacle.\n\nSnake: head at (3,3), moving left. Body segments: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), then turns up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), then left to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). So the tail is at (1,6).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (2,3) is right next to the head at (3,3), since head is at (3,3), moving left, so (2,3) is directly left of head. But life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n\n- (2,6) is at the same x as tail, y=6, but (2,6) is occupied by the snake? Let's see snake positions: positions include (2,6) and (1,6), so (2,6) is part of the body. Snake positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]. So (2,6) is the 10th segment, and (1,6) is the tail.\n\nBut food at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 6. But (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is food, which is not occupied, I think. (1,2) – is it occupied? Snake positions: all have y=3 or 6 except the vertical part, but (1,2) not listed, so it's free.\n\n(1,2) is food, not occupied.\n\nBut (2,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nNow, head direction is left, at (3,3).\n\nPossible moves from (3,3): since direction is left, I can move left, up, or down. Cannot move right because that's opposite direction, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so from (3,3), moving left would be to (2,3). Moving up would be to (3,4), moving down to (3,2). But (3,2) – is that a wall? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so (3,2) should be free, but there's an internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,2) is not (3,1), so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) should be free.\n\nNow, food at (2,3) is directly left, and life span 1, so if I move left to (2,3), I eat it this turn.\n\nBut is it safe? Moving to (2,3).\n\nAfter moving, the snake grows by one segment since it's positive food, so new head at (2,3), and tail stays, so snake becomes: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), ..., up to (1,6). The segment that was tail, (1,6), will not move because when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nWhen you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't advance; a new segment is added at the head position after moving.\n\nStandard snake: when you move to a food cell, you don't remove the tail that turn, so length increases by one.\n\nHere: when head moves to food cell, if it's positive, length increases by one, tail stays in place.\n\nIf not food, head moves, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nNow, in this case, if I move left to (2,3), I eat the food, so new positions: head at (2,3), then previous head (3,3) becomes second segment, and so on, up to tail (1,6) remains, so snake has 13 segments now.\n\nBut is (2,3) safe? After moving, head at (2,3), body segments: (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nNow, are there any collisions? (2,3) is not occupied by body before move, I think. Current positions: (3,3) is head, (4,3), etc., so (2,3) is food, not body, so moving to it should be fine, no body collision.\n\nBut after move, head at (2,3), with body at (3,3), etc., no issue.\n\nAlso, walls: (2,3) is within bounds, x=2>0, y=3>0, not (3,1), so ok.\n\nBut there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (1,6), which is not adjacent to head. Head is at (3,3), tail at (1,6), distance is |3-1| + |3-6| = 2+3=5, not adjacent. Adjacent would be one step away, like (1,3) or (2,4), etc., but (1,6) is far.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut food at (2,3) has life span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears. Since it's +1 score, I should eat it if possible.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nOther options: I could move up to (3,4) or down to (3,2).\n\nIf I move up to (3,4), no food there, so just move, tail moves, so snake shortens? No, when no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the end, so length same.\n\nCurrent length 12, if I move to (3,4), no food, so new head (3,4), then body (3,3), (4,3), ..., and tail (1,6) moves off, so the segment that was at (1,6) is removed, and the new tail is (2,6)? Positions: after moving head to (3,4), the body segments shift: second segment is now (3,3), third is (4,3), ..., and the last body segment that was (1,6) is removed, so snake is now from (3,4) to (2,6), but (2,6) was previously occupied, but now it's the tail.\n\nList positions: before move: head (3,3), then seg2 (4,3), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,5), seg7 (6,6), seg8 (5,6), seg9 (4,6), seg10 (3,6), seg11 (2,6), tail seg12 (1,6).\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4) without eating: new head (3,4), then seg2: (3,3), seg3: (4,3), seg4: (5,3), seg5: (6,3), seg6: (6,4), seg7: (6,5), seg8: (6,6), seg9: (5,6), seg10: (4,6), seg11: (3,6), seg12: (2,6). Tail is now (2,6), and (1,6) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (3,2), same thing.\n\nBut if I move left to (2,3), I eat food, so new head (2,3), then seg2: (3,3), seg3: (4,3), ..., up to seg12: (2,6)? No, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (2,3), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (4,3), ..., seg12: (1,6), and now there is a new segment added? When eating, after moving to food, a new segment is added at the position where the head was before moving? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, it grows. So when head moves to food cell, the tail does not move, so the new head is at food cell, the previous head is now part of body, and all segments stay, so length increases.\n\nFor example: head at (3,3), moves to (2,3) which has food, so new head (2,3), then the body includes (3,3) and all previous body, and tail (1,6) stays, so now 13 segments: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,3), eat food, score +1, length 13, head now at (2,3), direction left.\n\nThen next turn, from (2,3), possible moves: left to (1,3), up to (2,4), down to (2,2). Cannot right because opposite to current direction? Current direction after move is left, since moved left.\n\nHead direction: after moving left, new direction is left.\n\nSo cannot move right next turn.\n\nBut (1,3) is within bounds, should be free? Snake body: after move, positions include (3,3), (4,3), etc., but (1,3) not occupied, walls not there.\n\n(2,4) and (2,2) similarly.\n\nBut there is food at (1,2) with life span 9, and at (2,6) but (2,6) is occupied by body.\n\nOption 2: Move up to (3,4). No food, so move to (3,4), tail moves, so snake now: head (3,4), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). Tail at (2,6), length 12.\n\nHead direction: was left, but moved up, so new direction up.\n\nThen from there, can move up, left, right? Cannot down, opposite.\n\n(3,4) to (3,5) up, or (2,4) left, or (4,4) right? (4,4) is free? Yes.\n\nBut no immediate food.\n\nFood at (2,3) disappears after this turn if not eaten, so if I move up, (2,3) food gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (3,2), no food, snake moves, tail moves, head at (3,2), direction down? Moved down from (3,3), so direction down.\n\nThen from (3,2), can move down to (3,1), but (3,1) is wall! Internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nOr left to (2,2), or right to (4,2), or up? But moved down, so cannot up, opposite.\n\nCurrent direction down, so cannot move up.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2): down to (3,1) but wall, invalid; left to (2,2); right to (4,2); or up, but opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only left or right.\n\n(2,2) or (4,2).\n\n(2,2) might be towards food (1,2), but not directly.\n\nBut if I move down to (3,2), it's risky because only two choices, and (3,1) is wall.\n\nMoreover, moving down to (3,2) might not be good for long-term.\n\nSo better not to move down now.\n\nTherefore, from current position, moving left to eat (2,3) seems good, since food will disappear otherwise.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,6). It's under the body, at position (2,6), which is currently part of the snake, the 11th segment or something.\n\nIn the positions, (2,6) is occupied, and food is there with life span 6.\n\nTo eat it, the snake body must move away, and head must move onto it later.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,6), and (2,6) is before that.\n\nAfter some moves, when the snake moves, the tail will move, so (2,6) might become free.\n\nFor example, if we don't eat any food, each move the tail moves forward.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,6). If we move without eating, tail moves to (2,6)? Let's see.\n\nIn the current state, if we move without eating, say to (3,4), then as above, head to (3,4), tail from (1,6) removed, so (2,6) becomes the tail? In the new positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). So (2,6) is now the tail.\n\nAnd food is at (2,6), with value 1.\n\nBut according to \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, if head moves to (2,6) while it is the tail and has food, it might be dangerous.\n\nThe rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, if the tail is at a cell with food, and head moves to it, when you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, but since head moves to tail position, after eating, the head is there, and the tail is still there? Let's think.\n\nSuppose tail is at position P with food. Head moves to P to eat the food. Since it's positive food, length increases, so the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added. But since head moves to P, which was tail, now both head and tail are at P? No.\n\nBefore move: tail at P, head at some adjacent position, say Q.\n\nHead moves to P to eat food. After move, new head position is P. The previous tail remains in place because no tail movement when growing. But the tail was at P, and now head is at P, so they occupy the same cell? That's collision.\n\nYes, so if head moves to the tail cell to eat food, it causes collision because both head and tail are at same position after the move.\n\nTherefore, it's deadly.\n\nIn this case, for food at (2,6), if we move head to it when it is the tail, it's suicide.\n\nBut currently, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is (1,6). But after some moves, it might become tail.\n\nMoreover, life span is 6, so it has 6 turns including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 38, life span 1 for (2,3), 6 for (2,6), 9 for (1,2).\n\nFor (2,6), life span 6 at turn 38, so it will disappear after turn 43? Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, meaning after N steps.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span S, it will disappear at turn t + S - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, if at turn t, life span is L, then:\n\n- After turn t, countdown decreases to L-1\n\n- It exists as long as countdown >0, so it can be eaten on turn t with countdown L, and disappears after turn t + L - 1? I think it's better to think: at the start of turn, if countdown is C, it can be eaten during that turn, and after the turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nProbably: when a food is spawned, it has life span N, meaning it will disappear after N turns from now, so it exists for N turns, including the current one if spawned before.\n\nIn the input, it's given at turn t with life span L, so it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1, so not available on turn t+L.\n\nFor example, food at (2,3) with life span 1 at turn 38: it can be eaten on turn 38, and if not, disappears after turn 38, so not there on turn 39.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 6 at turn 38: can be eaten on turns 38 to 43, disappears after turn 43.\n\n(1,2) life span 9: turns 38 to 46.\n\nNow, back to (2,6) food. It is currently under the body at position (2,6), which is part of the snake.\n\nTo eat it, we need the snake to move so that (2,6) is vacated, then later head moves to it.\n\nBut when (2,6) is vacated, the food is still there if life span allows.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is occupied, so we can't eat it now.\n\nIf we move without eating, the tail will move. For example, if we move to (3,4), then after move, tail is at (2,6), and (2,6) has food, so now the tail cell has food.\n\nBut head is at (3,4), not adjacent to tail (2,6). (3,4) to (2,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share edge, so (2,6) and (3,6) or (2,5) or (2,7) but y=7 wall, or (1,6).\n\n(3,4) is not adjacent to (2,6).\n\nIf we want to eat (2,6), we need to move head to it when it is free and not tail if food is there, to avoid danger.\n\nSince it has food, if it becomes a free cell, and we move head to it, we eat it, but if at that time it is the tail, it would be dangerous, but if it's not tail, it's ok.\n\nFor example, after we move to (3,4), (2,6) is tail with food. If we then move head to (2,6), since head at (3,4), to move to (2,6), it's not adjacent; (2,6) is left-down or something, but not directly adjacent; from (3,4), adjacent are (3,5) up, (3,3) down, (2,4) left, (4,4) right. (2,6) is two steps away.\n\nSo we cannot move directly to (2,6) from (3,4) in one move.\n\nTo reach (2,6), we need to go through other cells.\n\nBut (2,6) is currently tail, and with food, so if we move head to it when it is tail, it kills us.\n\nBut after this turn, if we don't eat, tail moves, but in this case, after moving to (3,4), tail is at (2,6) with food, so (2,6) is occupied by tail with food.\n\nThen on next turn, if we move the head to (2,6), it would be moving to tail cell with food, which causes collision.\n\nBut to move to (2,6) from (3,4), it's not possible directly; we need to go to (2,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nSuppose from (3,4), we move left to (2,4). Then head at (2,4), tail still at (2,6)? After moving head to (2,4), since no food eaten, tail moves: the tail (2,6) is removed, and new tail is (3,6)? Positions: after move to (2,4): head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), ..., up to (3,6), and tail was (2,6), removed, so new tail is (3,6)? Let's list: previous positions after first move: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6).\n\nAfter moving head to (2,4) without eating: new head (2,4), then body: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). Tail (2,6) removed, so (2,6) is now free, and food is there.\n\nBut (2,6) was the tail position, now vacated, and food is still there since life span 6, turn 39 now? Turn 38 we moved to (3,4), turn 39 move to (2,4).\n\nAt turn 39, food at (2,6) has life span decreased to 5? At turn 38, life span 6, after turn 38, it decreases to 5 for turn 39.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is now free at turn 39, with food.\n\nHead is at (2,4), which is above (2,6), but not adjacent; (2,4) to (2,6) is two cells away, with (2,5) in between.\n\n(2,5) is currently free, I think. No wall or snake? Snake positions after move to (2,4): (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So (2,5) not occupied, should be free.\n\nSo from (2,4), I can move down to (2,5), then to (2,6) to eat food.\n\nBut if I move to (2,6) when it has food, and if it is not the tail, it should be ok.\n\nAt that point, tail is at (3,6), which is not (2,6), so no problem.\n\nBut I need to check if (2,6) is tail at that time.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 39, head at (2,4), tail at (3,6).\n\nIf I move down to (2,5) on turn 39, no food, so head to (2,5), tail moves to (4,6) or something.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5): head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), ..., (3,6), and tail (4,6)? Previous tail (3,6) removed, so new tail is (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 40, move down to (2,6), which has food, so eat it, grow to length 13, head at (2,6), body includes (2,5), (2,4), etc., tail at (4,6) or wherever.\n\nNo issue since tail not at (2,6) when eating.\n\nBut this is a possible plan.\n\nHowever, for now, at turn 38, I have the option to eat the food at (2,3) immediately.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2) with longer life span.\n\nBut (2,3) will disappear if not eaten now.\n\nMoreover, eating it gives +1 score.\n\nBut let's think about the risks.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat food, head at (2,3), length 13.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,3), or (2,4), or (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is towards (1,2) food.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is adjacent to (1,3) or (2,2) or (1,1), but (1,1) might be wall? Walls: x=0, y=0, etc., so (1,1) is not wall, but borders are walls, so (1,1) is within, since x=0 and y=0 are walls, so (1,1) is corner? Cells: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so min x=1, max x=6? No.\n\n\"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall. Also internal obstacle (3,1).\n\nSo for example, (0,y) wall for all y, (7,y) wall, (x,0) wall, (x,7) wall.\n\nSo playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nSo grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, with (3,1) blocked.\n\nNow, (1,2) is at x=1,y=2. x=1 is not border? Border is x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not wall, it's playable. Similarly y=2 not wall.\n\n(1,2) is valid cell.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3), (2,2), etc.\n\nBack to after eating (2,3): head at (2,3), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: left to (1,3), up to (2,4), down to (2,2).\n\nNow, (1,3) is free? Current snake positions after eating: head (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). So (1,3) not occupied, should be free.\n\n(2,4) not occupied, (2,2) not occupied.\n\n(2,2) is closer to (1,2) food.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is down-left from (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), moving down to (2,2) gets me closer.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move left to (1,2) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,3) first, then down to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) has life span 9, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,6) is there, but it's under the body, at (2,6), which is currently a body segment.\n\nIn the positions, (2,6) is occupied, so to eat it, we need to vacate it.\n\nIf we eat (2,3), the snake grows, so (2,6) is still occupied, but as we move, if we don't eat, it might become free later.\n\nBut with the growth, it might take longer.\n\nAt turn 38, after eating (2,3), positions include (2,6) as body.\n\nThen when we move without eating, tail moves, so (1,6) is removed first, then (2,6) might become tail later.\n\nFor example, after some moves, the tail will be at (2,6) eventually, if no eating.\n\nBut since we ate, length is 13, tail at (1,6).\n\nAfter one move without eating, tail moves to (2,6), which has food, so tail cell has food.\n\nThen if head moves to it, danger.\n\nBut head is at (2,3), far from (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), we need to go through other cells.\n\nBut it might be possible to eat it safely if we time it.\n\nSince life span 6, we have time.\n\nFor now, eating (2,3) seems good because it's immediate +1 and it disappears otherwise.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I miss the opportunity.\n\nMoreover, moving left seems safe.\n\nBut let's consider the grid and potential dead ends.\n\nThe snake is currently in a sort of loop: from (3,3) to (6,3) right, then up to (6,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nAfter eating (2,3), head at (2,3), I can move to (1,3), then to (1,2) to eat that food, or to (1,4), etc.\n\n(1,2) is food, so I can plan to eat it soon.\n\nFrom (2,3), move down to (2,2), then left to (1,2) to eat on turn 40.\n\nTurn 38: move left to (2,3), eat (2,3)\n\nThen turn 39: from (2,3), move down to (2,2), no food there, so just move, tail moves: after turn 38, snake: (2,3), (3,3), ..., (1,6)\n\nAfter move to (2,2) without eating: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), ..., and tail (1,6) removed, so new tail is (2,6)? Positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). Tail at (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) has food! So tail is at (2,6) with food.\n\nNow, head at (2,2), not adjacent to tail (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 40, I can move left to (1,2) to eat the food there.\n\n(1,2) has food, so move to (1,2), eat it, grow to length 14? Current length after turn 39 is 13? After turn 38, length 13, after turn 39 no eat, length 13, tail moved, so still 13 segments.\n\nAfter eating (1,2) on turn 40, length 14.\n\nHead at (1,2), and tail at (2,6) with food.\n\nNow, (1,2) to (2,6) is not adjacent.\n\nBut the food at (2,6) is still there, life span decreasing.\n\nTo eat (2,6), I need to move head to it when it is free.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,6) with food, so I cannot move to it directly.\n\nI need to move so that the tail moves away.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat, on next move, tail will move from (2,6), so (2,6) becomes free with food.\n\nThen I can move to it.\n\nBut head is at (1,2), far.\n\nLet's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 38, I think moving left to eat (2,3) is the best, since it's free score and avoids missing it.\n\nIf I don't, and move up or down, I lose the food, and gain nothing.\n\nMoreover, moving down to (3,2) is risky because from there, I can only go left or right, and (3,1) is wall, so if I go to (3,2), then to (2,2) or (4,2), both might lead to less options.\n\nFor example, (2,2) is towards (1,2), but I can go there later.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (3,4) might open more space.\n\nBut I think eating the immediate food is better.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, the snake is long, 12 segments, so space might be limited, but grid is 6x6 minus obstacles, so 36 cells minus snake 12, 24 free, but with walls and obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1) obstacle.\n\nSo total cells: 6*6 = 36 minus 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 12, so 23 free cells.\n\nFood at (1,2) and (2,6) occupied but with food.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), snake 13, free 22.\n\nThen I can eat (1,2) soon.\n\n(2,6) food can be eaten later if possible.\n\nBut let's plan at least 5 turns.\n\nSince the answer format is to list actions for multiple turns, I need to specify actions for turn 38, 39, 40, etc., but probably starting from turn 38.\n\nThe output should be actions for turn 38 and subsequent turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for current and future, I think.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nFor t1=38.\n\nSo I need to decide for turn 38 first.\n\nI think I should move left to eat (2,3).\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nPerhaps I can simulate.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (2,3), head at (2,3), I should avoid moving in a way that traps me.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (1,3), then I am at x=1, which is near border, but not wall, but less space.\n\nx=1 is playable.\n\nFrom (2,3), moving down to (2,2) is better to go for (1,2) food.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,4) might lead to upper area.\n\nBut the upper area has the snake body at (6,4) to (6,6), etc.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nI should not overcomplicate; since (1,2) is food, I can plan to eat it.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,6) might be eaten when the tail moves away.\n\nBut with the growth, it might be delayed.\n\nSince life span 6, it's ok.\n\nFor turn 38, I move left to (2,3), eat food.\n\nAction for turn 38: L\n\nThen for turn 39, from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) to approach (1,2).\n\n(2,2) should be free; no snake or wall.\n\nThen turn 39: move D to (2,2)\n\nNo food at (2,2), so just move, tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 38: snake positions: head (2,3), body (3,3) to (1,6) as before.\n\nAfter move to (2,2): head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). Tail at (2,6) with food.\n\nNow, (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2)? (2,2) to (1,2) is left, adjacent.\n\n(1,2) has food.\n\nSo on turn 40, I can move left to (1,2) to eat it.\n\nMove L to (1,2), eat food, grow to length 14.\n\nHead at (1,2), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNow, tail is at (2,6) with food, but head at (1,2), far.\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves: left to (1,1)? But y=1, x=1, (1,1) is not wall, since walls are x=0,y=0, so (1,1) is playable.\n\nOr up to (1,3), or down? Down to (1,1) but (1,1) is down? From (1,2), down would be (1,1), up to (1,3), right to (2,2), but (2,2) is now body.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 40: head at (1,2), after eating, so body includes previous positions except tail moved? When eating at (1,2), head moved to (1,2), so new head (1,2), body: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,6). But (2,6) is still there? When we eat, tail doesn't move.\n\nBefore turn 40: head at (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,6). (2,6) is tail with food.\n\nMove to (1,2) which has food, so eat, grow: new head (1,2), then body: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). So (2,6) is still tail, with food, but not eaten since head not on it.\n\nNow head at (1,2), tail at (2,6).\n\nFrom (1,2), moves: left to (1,1)? (1,1) is free? Probably, but near border.\n\nx=1,y=1, not wall.\n\nUp to (1,3), or right to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, cannot move there.\n\nCannot move down? Down would be to (1,1), same as left? Directions: from (1,2), U: (1,3), D: (1,1), L: ? x decreases, but x=1, L would be to (0,2) which is wall, invalid.\n\nR: (2,2) which is body, occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nCannot L or R.\n\n(1,3) might be free; let's see current positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,6). (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) free.\n\nNow, moving to (1,3) or (1,1).\n\nIf I move to (1,3), then I can go up or down from there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) might be dead end.\n\n(1,1) has neighbors: (1,2) body, (2,1), and (1,0) wall, so only (2,1) if free.\n\nBut (2,1) might be free.\n\nTo avoid getting stuck, better to move up to (1,3).\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move to other places.\n\nBut back to the food at (2,6). It is still there, under tail, with life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 40, life span of (2,6) was 6 at turn 38, decreased by 2 turns? Turn 38: life span 6, after turn 38, decreases to 5 for turn 39.\n\nAfter turn 39, decreases to 4 for turn 40.\n\nAt turn 40, life span 4 remaining? Let's track.\n\nTurn 38: food (2,6) life span 6\n\nAfter turn 38 action, if not eaten, life span decreases to 5 for turn 39.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 39, decreases to 4 for turn 40.\n\nAfter turn 40, decreases to 3 for turn 41, and so on.\n\nSo at turn 40, when we are at (1,2), (2,6) has food with life span 4 (for turn 40).\n\nTo eat it, we need to move head to (2,6) when it is free.\n\nBut currently, it is occupied by tail.\n\nIf we don't eat on turn 40, after turn 40, we moved to (1,3) or wherever, tail will move.\n\nFor example, on turn 40, after eating (1,2), head at (1,2), we move to (1,3) or (1,1).\n\nSay we move U to (1,3).\n\nNo food, so move to (1,3), tail moves: tail was at (2,6), removed, so (2,6) becomes free, and food is there.\n\nNew tail is (3,6)? Positions: after move to (1,3): head (1,3), body (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). Tail at (3,6).\n\nAnd (2,6) is now free with food.\n\nLife span: at turn 40, after action, if not eaten, life span decreases to 3 for turn 41.\n\nOn turn 41, head at (1,3), which is not adjacent to (2,6).\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) body, R to (2,3) but (2,3) body, L to (0,3) wall invalid.\n\nSo only U to (1,4).\n\nMust move up.\n\nThen to (1,4), similarly, only up to (1,5), then to (1,6), but (1,6) was tail earlier, but now might be free? Not necessarily.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4): head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), ..., (3,6). Tail at (3,6).\n\nThen move to (1,5), head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), etc., tail moves to (4,6).\n\nThen to (1,6), but (1,6) is within bounds? y=6, but not wall, x=1,y=6.\n\n(1,6) might be free or not.\n\nIn current positions, after above, when we go to (1,6), it should be free if not occupied.\n\nBut initially, (1,6) was tail, but after moves, it might be vacated.\n\nIn the sequence, at some point, (1,6) is free.\n\nBut if I go to (1,6), I can then move left or right, but x=1, left invalid, so right to (2,6) or up to (1,7) wall, down to (1,5) body.\n\nSo from (1,6), only possible move right to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has food, so if I move to (2,6), I can eat it.\n\nBut when? In the plan, from (1,2) turn 40 move to (1,3), turn 41 to (1,4), turn 42 to (1,5), turn 43 to (1,6).\n\nThen on turn 44, move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 44, food (2,6) life span: originally life span 6 at turn 38.\n\nAfter turn 38: life span 5 for 39\n\n39:4 for 40\n\n40:3 for 41\n\n41:2 for 42\n\n42:1 for 43\n\nAfter turn 43, decreases to 0, disappears, so on turn 44, not available.\n\nLife span: at turn 38, life span 6, can be eaten on turns 38 to 43? Disappears after N turns.\n\nAfter N turns, it disappears.\n\nTurn 38: available\n\nAfter turn 38, if not eaten, countdown to 5, available turn 39\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 43, countdown to 0, disappears, not available turn 44.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 43.\n\nAt turn 43, if head moves to (2,6), it can be eaten.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 43, head is at (1,6) if we moved up.\n\nFrom (1,6), we can move to (2,6) on turn 43 to eat.\n\n(2,6) at turn 43 should have life span 1, since turn 38:6, 39:5,40:4,41:3,42:2,43:1.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 43.\n\nAnd (2,6) should be free.\n\nIn the plan, after turn 42, when we move to (1,6), (2,6) is free with food.\n\nThen turn 43 move to (2,6) eat.\n\nNow, when we eat at (2,6), is it safe?\n\nAt that time, what is the tail?\n\nBefore turn 43: let's track positions.\n\nStart from turn 38: move L to (2,3), eat (2,3), snake: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) length 13\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2), no food, so head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). Tail (1,6) removed, so tail at (2,6) with food. Positions: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail at (2,6)\n\nTurn 40: move L to (1,2), eat (1,2), so grow: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail at (2,6) with food.\n\nTurn 41: move U to (1,3), no food, so head (1,3), body (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). Tail (2,6) removed, so (2,6) free with food, new tail at (3,6)\n\nTurn 42: move U to (1,4), no food, head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). Tail at (3,6) removed? When tail moves: after move, head to (1,4), tail was (3,6) removed, new tail is (4,6)\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n\n(2,6) is free.\n\nTurn 43: move U to (1,5)? From (1,4) move U to (1,5), no food, head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Tail (4,6) removed, new tail (5,6)\n\n(2,6) still free with food, life span for turn 43:1, can be eaten.\n\nBut head at (1,5), not at (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), from (1,5), I can move right to (2,5) or up to (1,6), etc.\n\n(1,5) to (2,6) not adjacent.\n\nMove to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\n(1,6) is free? Currently not occupied.\n\nAfter turn 42, positions: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail (4,6)? Turn 42 head (1,4), tail (4,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,5) turn 43: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Tail (4,6) removed, new tail (5,6)\n\n(1,6) free, (2,5) free, (2,6) free.\n\nFrom (1,5), move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf move to (1,6), then turn 44, but turn 43 is last chance for (2,6) food.\n\nOn turn 43, from (1,5), I can move to (2,5) or (1,6), not directly to (2,6).\n\n(2,5) is adjacent to (2,6), but I need to be at (2,6) to eat.\n\nSo on turn 43, I can move to (2,5), then on turn 44 to (2,6), but turn 44 food disappeared.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,6) in this sequence because on turn 43 I'm not at (2,6).\n\nIn turn 43, from (1,5), I can only move to (1,6) or (2,5), not to (2,6) directly.\n\nIf I move to (2,5), then from there on turn 44, move to (2,6), but food gone.\n\nSo I miss the food at (2,6).\n\nBut it's not critical, since I ate two other foods.\n\nIn the initial, I have three foods, I ate (2,3) and (1,2), missed (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) was under body, hard to get.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to eat it earlier.\n\nFor example, after turn 38, instead of going down to (2,2), I could go up or something.\n\nBut let's not optimize too much.\n\nFor now, at turn 38, moving left to eat (2,3) is good.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide multiple turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, but output for as many as I can.\n\nBut the format is to list actions starting from turn 38.\n\nPerhaps for turn 38: L\n\nThen for turn 39, from (2,3), I said move D to (2,2), but to reach (1,2), I could also move L to (1,3) first, then D to (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,3), move L to (1,3), then turn 40 move D to (1,2) to eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut moving down to (2,2) is fine.\n\nIn that case, from (2,2), I move L to (1,2) to eat on turn 40.\n\nThen from (1,2), I need to move, say U to (1,3).\n\nThen from (1,3), only U to (1,4), etc.\n\nBut to avoid getting stuck in the corner, I could after eating (1,2), move to (1,3), then to (1,4), then to (1,5), then to (1,6), then to (2,6) if food still, but as above, not possible.\n\nSince (2,6) food will disappear, I can ignore it.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I can try to go to other areas.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), move U to (1,3), then instead of going up, I can only go up, to (1,4), etc.\n\nThe only way is up to (1,6), then right to (2,6) or other.\n\nBut (2,6) gone.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can move to (2,6) if free, but no food, or to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor the output, I can provide:\n\nTurn 38: L (to eat (2,3))\n\nTurn 39: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 40: L (to eat (1,2) at (1,2))\n\nThen turn 41: U (to (1,3))\n\nThen turn 42: U (to (1,4))\n\nEtc.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive.\n\nSince the grid has free cells, I can navigate.\n\nBut to be complete, let's list 5 turns or so.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 38, if I don't eat (2,3), I move up to (3,4), then I can go to other areas, but I miss the food.\n\nNot better.\n\nMove down to (3,2), but only left or right, and (3,1) wall, so risky.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), move left to (2,2), then to (1,2), eat, etc.\n\nBut still, I miss (2,3) food.\n\nSo better to eat it.\n\nTherefore, I think for turn 38, move L.\n\nThen for turn 39, move D to (2,2) to approach (1,2).\n\nThen turn 40 move L to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 41, from (1,2), move U to (1,3) (only choice besides D to (1,1), which is worse).\n\nSimilarly, turn 42 move U to (1,4), turn 43 move U to (1,5), turn 44 move U to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) can be eaten if I plan, but as above, not feasible with the path, so I'll skip it.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: L\n\nThen for turn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, head direction changes.\n\nAt turn 38, move L, direction becomes L.\n\nTurn 39, move D, so from (2,3) down to (2,2), direction now D.\n\nTurn 40, move L to (1,2), which is left, but current direction is D, so moving left is perpendicular, allowed, not reverse.\n\nReverse would be up, opposite to down.\n\nSo moving left or right from down direction is ok.\n\nThen after moving left, direction L.\n\nTurn 41, from (1,2) move U, up, perpendicular to left, ok.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 42 move U to (1,4), direction U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 38):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8, but walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1).

Positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] (length 12).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,3): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 38 if not eaten).\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 43).\n  - (1,2): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 46).\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Plan:**\n- **Immediate Opportunity**: Food at (2,3) must be eaten on turn 38 (life span 1), providing +1 score and growing the snake to length 13. Not eating it wastes the opportunity.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Moving down to (3,2) is dangerous as it leaves only left/right moves, and (3,1) is a wall, potentially trapping the snake.\n  - Food at (2,6) is under the body and can only be eaten if the snake moves away and the head moves onto it later. However, eating it when adjacent to the tail risks collision (Tail Reward Danger rule). With life span 6, it can be targeted later if feasible.\n  - After eating (2,3) and (1,2), the snake may get confined to the left edge (x=1), requiring careful navigation to avoid dead ends.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Prioritize eating (2,3) and (1,2) for score, then navigate to open areas. Avoid the tail risk with (2,6) as it may not be safely reachable within its life span given the snake's position and growth. Focus on maximizing free space after eating available food.\n- **Path Feasibility**: \n  - Turn 38: Move left (L) to (2,3) to eat food (mandatory to avoid loss).\n  - Turn 39: Move down (D) to (2,2) to approach (1,2) food.\n  - Turn 40: Move left (L) to (1,2) to eat food, growing to length 14.\n  - Beyond: From (1,2), only safe moves are up (U) to avoid corner traps. This leads to a path along y-axis, but (2,6) food may expire before it can be eaten safely. Survival is prioritized over this food.\n\n**Planned Actions (5+ Turns):**\n- **Turn 38**: Move L to eat (2,3) (+1 score, length 13). Head at (2,3), direction L.\n- **Turn 39**: Move D to (2,2) (no food, length 13). Head at (2,2), direction D. Tail moves, leaving (2,6) as tail with food.\n- **Turn 40**: Move L to (1,2) to eat food (+1 score, length 14). Head at (1,2), direction L. Only moves are U or D; U is chosen to avoid bottom corner.\n- **Turn 41**: Move U to (1,3) (no food, length 14). Head at (1,3), direction U. Only U move is safe; (1,2) is body, (2,3) is body, left invalid.\n- **Turn 42**: Move U to (1,4) (no food, length 14). Head at (1,4), direction U. Path continues upward to open space.\n- **Turn 43**: Move U to (1,5) (no food, length 14). Head at (1,5), direction U. (2,6) food expires after this turn.\n- **Turn 44**: Move U to (1,6) (no food, length 14). Head at (1,6), direction U. Then, only move is right (R) to (2,6), but food is gone; navigate to center.\n\n**Conclusion**: This plan secures +2 score by eating (2,3) and (1,2), avoids immediate risks, and ensures survival for at least 5 turns. (2,6) is not pursued due to low reward, high risk, and path constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: L \\\\\nTurn 39: D \\\\\nTurn 40: L \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 39, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since walls occupy those, the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. But let's list the snake positions to verify.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nAll these positions are within x from 1 to 6 and y from 3 to 6, so yes, playable area is (1,1) to (6,6), but we have an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, snake head is at (2,3) and direction is L, which is left. So current direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (2,3) from previous position.\n\nThe positions list is head first, so head is (2,3), then body: (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nSince direction is L, and head is at (2,3), that means it came from (3,3) to (2,3) by moving left.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1 each.\n\nLife span: for (2,6), it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so if not eaten, it will be gone in 5 turns. Similarly, (1,2) has life span 8 turns.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a 6x6 grid from (1,1) to (6,6), but since walls are at borders, cells like (1,1), (1,2), etc., are playable except for obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,3)\n\nBody: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nTail is (1,6)\n\nNow, food at (2,6) and (1,2)\n\n(2,6) is occupied by the snake! Let's see: snake positions include (2,6), which is the 12th segment? Positions list: index 0: head (2,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (2,6), 12: (1,6) tail.\n\nSo (2,6) is position index 11, which is part of the body, not the tail. Tail is (1,6).\n\nBut food is at (2,6), which is currently under the snake's body.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is a free cell, I think, since not in snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: all listed, so (1,2) is not in the list, and not a wall, so it should be free.\n\nBut (2,6) has food, but it's under the body.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's find possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head: (2,3), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nBut no instant reverse: since current direction is L, reverse is R (right), so cannot move right on next turn.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L. Not R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move leads to.\n\nMove U (up): from (2,3) to (2,4)\n\nIs (2,4) safe? Not a wall, not a body part? Snake positions: (2,3) is head, (3,3) is next, etc. (2,4) is not in positions, so empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nOccupied by snake: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo (2,4) is not occupied, and not a wall. Walls are at borders, so (2,4) should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, move D (down): to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) not in snake positions, not wall? Walls: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (2,2) is within 1-6, so ok.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not affecting.\n\nMove L (left): to (1,3)\n\n(1,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (1,6), but not (1,3). (1,3) should be free, since x=1 is not wall, y=3, playable.\n\nx=1 is not wall, because walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to y=6 except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle only at (3,1), so (1,3) is free.\n\nBut let's confirm: snake positions include (1,6), so x=1 is accessible.\n\nNow, move R (right) is not allowed because reverse, current direction L, so R is opposite, forbidden.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (2,6) and (1,2).\n\n(2,6) is currently occupied by the snake, specifically position index 11: (2,6).\n\nSince it's under the body, to eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto it.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is occupied, so we need to move such that in some future turn, the snake moves off (2,6) and then head can move to it.\n\nAlso, life span: (2,6) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including current turn 39. So if not eaten by turn 43, it's gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nThe food has a life span, which is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn. So at turn 39, life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns, so at the start of turn 44, it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span N, after one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes N-1.\n\nWhen life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (2,6) at turn 39, life span 5, so it will be present until turn 43, and disappear at turn 44? Let's see:\n\nTurn 39: life span 5\n\nAfter turn 39, countdown decreases, so at turn 40, life span 4\n\nTurn 41: 3\n\nTurn 42: 2\n\nTurn 43: 1\n\nTurn 44: 0, disappears.\n\nBut when is it eaten? If head moves to the cell on turn t, it is eaten at that turn.\n\nSo to eat (2,6), it must be eaten on or before turn 43.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) life span 8, so present until turn 46, disappear at turn 47.\n\nNow, back to (2,6): it is currently under the body at (2,6). To eat it, the snake must move so that (2,6) is vacated, and then head moves to it.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, the body moves forward, so segments shift.\n\nLet's think about the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. The tail cell is vacated unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves, so the cell is vacated.\n\nIf food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the cell where tail was remains occupied, but the snake grows, so a new segment is added at the tail position? Standard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, when food is eaten, snake length +1 for positive food, unchanged for negative.\n\nFor (2,6), it's positive food, so if eaten, length increases.\n\nBut to eat it, it must be free when head moves to it.\n\nCurrently, at turn 39, (2,6) is occupied.\n\nAfter one move, what happens?\n\nSuppose at turn 39, I move in some direction.\n\nHead moves to new position, say to P.\n\nThen the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to segment 1 old position, and so on, up to the tail.\n\nThe tail position is vacated, unless food is eaten at that turn.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten yet, so tail moves, vacating (1,6).\n\nBut for (2,6), it is currently occupied by segment 11. When snake moves, segment 11 will move to the position of segment 10, which is (3,6)? Positions: let's index.\n\nPositions: 0: (2,3) head\n\n1: (3,3)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (5,3)\n\n4: (6,3)\n\n5: (6,4)\n\n6: (6,5)\n\n7: (6,6)\n\n8: (5,6)\n\n9: (4,6)\n\n10: (3,6)\n\n11: (2,6)\n\n12: (1,6) tail\n\nAfter a move, head moves to new cell.\n\nThen, segment 1 moves to (2,3), segment 2 to (3,3), ..., segment 11 moves to (3,6) (which was segment 10), and segment 12 (tail) moves to (2,6) if no food eaten, but (2,6) is the old position of segment 11.\n\nWhen head moves, each body segment i moves to the previous position of segment i-1.\n\nSpecifically, after move:\n\n- New head position: where head moved to\n\n- Body segment 1 (new position 1) = old head position\n\n- Body segment 2 = old position of segment 1\n\n- ...\n\n- Body segment k = old position of segment k-1 for k from 1 to 12\n\nLet old positions be P0, P1, P2, ..., P12 where P0 head, P12 tail.\n\nAfter move to new head Q:\n\n- New head: Q\n\n- New segment 1: P0\n\n- New segment 2: P1\n\n- New segment 3: P2\n\n- ...\n\n- New segment 12: P11\n\n- And if no food eaten, P12 is vacated.\n\nIf food eaten at Q, then no vacate, new tail added at P12, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, for cell (2,6), it is currently P11.\n\nAfter one move, if no food eaten, segment 11 moves to P10, which is (3,6), and P11 (2,6) is now occupied by new segment 12, which moved from P12? New segment 12 is at P11, which is (2,6).\n\nOld P11 is (2,6), after move, new segment 12 is at old P11, which is (2,6).\n\nSince no food eaten, the tail old P12 (1,6) is vacated.\n\nBut (2,6) is still occupied by the new tail? New snake: head at Q, then segments at P0, P1, P2, ..., P11.\n\nP0 to P11 are the positions, with P11 being the new tail.\n\nOld P11 was (2,6), and new tail is at old P11, so (2,6) is still occupied by the new tail.\n\nSimilarly, old P12 (1,6) is vacated.\n\nSo (2,6) remains occupied after the move, because it was the position of segment 11, and after move, it becomes the tail position.\n\nLet's take a smaller example.\n\nSuppose snake: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3). Direction down or something.\n\nAfter move left to (0,1): new head (0,1), body segment 1 at (1,1), segment 2 (tail) at (1,2), and (1,3) vacated.\n\nOld positions: P0 (1,1), P1 (1,2), P2 (1,3)\n\nMove head to (0,1)\n\nNew: head (0,1), seg1 at old P0 (1,1), seg2 at old P1 (1,2), and old P2 (1,3) vacated.\n\nNow, if there was food at (1,2), which was P1, after move, seg2 is at old P1 (1,2), so if head moves to (1,2) at some point, but (1,2) is occupied by body.\n\nIn this case, for (2,6), it is P11, after any move where no food eaten, P11 becomes the new tail position, so (2,6) is still occupied.\n\nOnly when the snake moves such that the segment at (2,6) moves away, but since it's not the tail, it will be occupied until that segment is no longer part of the body, which happens when the tail moves past it.\n\nSpecifically, (2,6) will be vacated when the tail moves off it, but since it's not the tail yet, it will be occupied for several moves.\n\nIn the current state, (2,6) is position 11, and tail is 12 at (1,6).\n\nAfter one move with no food, new tail will be at old P11 (2,6), so (2,6) is still occupied.\n\nAfter another move with no food, new tail at old P10 (3,6), and (2,6) vacated if it was tail, but it was not, old P11 was (2,6), which is now body, but let's track.\n\nI am considering the position of the segment that is at (2,6).\n\nCurrently, segment 11 is at (2,6).\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, segment 11 will move to the position of segment 10, which is (3,6), so (2,6) is left, and the new position for segment 11 is (3,6), and tail moves to (2,6)? No.\n\nAfter move:\n- Head to new position\n- New segment 1 at old P0\n- New segment 2 at old P1\n- ...\n- New segment 11 at old P10\n- New segment 12 (tail) at old P11\n\nSo old P11 (2,6) is now the new tail position.\n\nSo (2,6) is still occupied by the tail.\n\nThen, on the next move, if no food, head moves somewhere, new segment 1 at old head, etc., new tail at old P10, which was (3,6), so (2,6) is vacated because the tail moved to (3,6).\n\nSo after two moves with no food eaten, the cell (2,6) will be vacated.\n\nSimilarly, in general, to vacate a body cell, it takes a number of moves equal to the distance from the head or something.\n\nSpecifically for (2,6), it is currently occupied by segment 11.\n\nThe tail is segment 12 at (1,6).\n\nThe number of segments between head and this cell: head is segment 0, (2,6) is segment 11, so 11 segments away from head.\n\nAfter k moves with no food eaten, the segment at position i will move to a new position, and the cell will be vacated when the tail moves past it.\n\nSince each move with no food, the tail moves forward, so the vacated cell is the old tail position.\n\nTo vacate (2,6), it needs to become the tail position and then the snake moves without eating.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (1,6).\n\nAfter one move with no food, the new tail will be at old P11, which is (2,6), so (2,6) becomes the tail.\n\nThen, on the next move with no food, when head moves, the tail moves off (2,6) to the new position, and (2,6) is vacated.\n\nSo it takes two moves to vacate (2,6): first move to make it tail, second move to move tail off.\n\nSimilarly, for any body cell not tail, it takes two moves to vacate if no food eaten in between.\n\nIf food is eaten during those moves, it might delay or something.\n\nBut in this case, for (2,6) to be eatable, we need to vacate it and then have head move to it.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 39.\n\nCurrent head (2,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U (2,4), D (2,2), L (1,3), R not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, U to (2,4): is (2,4) occupied? Snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), etc. no (2,4), so free. Not wall. So safe to move there.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,2): (2,2) not occupied, not wall, so safe.\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) not occupied, not wall, safe.\n\nR not allowed.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will shift.\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) and (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is currently occupied, so we need to vacate it first.\n\nLet's think about the path.\n\nThe snake is long, 13 segments, so it's quite large on the 6x6 grid.\n\nPlayable area: 6x6 = 36 cells, snake occupies 13, so 23 free, but with food and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so 35 cells total? Grid 1-6 x 1-6, 36 cells, minus walls, but walls are borders, so 36 cells, minus obstacle (3,1), so 35 cells, snake 13, so 22 free cells.\n\nFood at (1,2) and (2,6), but (2,6) is occupied, so (1,2) is free.\n\nNow, to eat (2,6), we need to have it vacated and head move to it.\n\nAs above, it takes two moves to vacate (2,6) if no food eaten.\n\nFirst, after turn 39 move with no food, (2,6) becomes the tail.\n\nAfter turn 40 move with no food, (2,6) is vacated.\n\nThen on turn 41, head can move to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nBut life span: at turn 39, life span 5, so after turn 39, at turn 40, life span 4; turn 41, life span 3; turn 42, life span 2; turn 43, life span 1; turn 44, gone.\n\nSo on turn 41, life span 3, still there, so possible to eat on turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, if we eat on turn 41, it should be ok.\n\nBut we need to have (2,6) vacated by turn 41.\n\nVacated on turn 40 after the move, so on turn 41, it is free to move to.\n\nNow, for that, on turn 39 and turn 40, no food should be eaten, so that the tail moves properly.\n\nIf we eat food on turn 39 or 40, it might affect the vacating.\n\nBut let's first consider the actions.\n\nAlso, there is tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, (2,6) has food, and it will be tail soon.\n\nLet's simulate the moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 39, I need to choose a move.\n\nAlso, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nAnother food at (1,2), life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (1,2) is far from current position.\n\nCurrent head (2,3), (1,2) is at (1,2), which is one left and one down from (2,3)? (2,3) to (1,2) is left and down, but not adjacent; adjacent cells are (1,3), (2,4), (2,2), (3,3), etc.\n\n(1,2) is not adjacent to (2,3); it's diagonal or something.\n\nFrom (2,3), adjacent are (2,4) up, (2,2) down, (1,3) left, (3,3) right, but right not allowed.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is not directly adjacent to (2,3); the distance is |2-1| + |3-2| =1+1=2, so two cells away.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I need at least two moves.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is at (2,6), from (2,3), same x, y from 3 to 6, so up, but there are body in between.\n\nThe snake is from (2,3) to (6,3) to (6,6) to (1,6), so it's like a C shape or something.\n\nLet me sketch the grid:\n\ny=6: (1,6) tail, (2,6) food/body, (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\ny=5: (6,5)\n\ny=4: (6,4)\n\ny=3: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) head\n\ny=2: ? free except food at (1,2)\n\ny=1: with obstacle at (3,1), so (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) free? But not specified.\n\nSo grid:\n\nRows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\n- y=6: x=1: tail, x=2: body with food, x=3: body, x=4: body, x=5: body, x=6: body\n\n- y=5: x=6: body\n\n- y=4: x=6: body\n\n- y=3: x=2: head, x=3: body, x=4: body, x=5: body, x=6: body\n\n- y=2: all free except x=1: food at (1,2)\n\n- y=1: all free except obstacle at (3,1), so (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) free\n\nNow, head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\n(2,4) is free, (2,2) is free, (1,3) is free.\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), then new head (2,4), body: seg1 at (2,3), seg2 at (3,3), ..., up to seg12 at (2,6)? Old positions: P0 (2,3), P1 (3,3), P2 (4,3), P3 (5,3), P4 (6,3), P5 (6,4), P6 (6,5), P7 (6,6), P8 (5,6), P9 (4,6), P10 (3,6), P11 (2,6), P12 (1,6)\n\nAfter move U to (2,4):\n- New head: (2,4)\n- New seg1: old P0 (2,3)\n- New seg2: old P1 (3,3)\n- New seg3: old P2 (4,3)\n- New seg4: old P3 (5,3)\n- New seg5: old P4 (6,3)\n- New seg6: old P5 (6,4)  but (6,4) is old P5, new seg6 at old P5\n- New seg7: old P6 (6,5)\n- New seg8: old P7 (6,6)\n- New seg9: old P8 (5,6)\n- New seg10: old P9 (4,6)\n- New seg11: old P10 (3,6)\n- New seg12: old P11 (2,6)  so tail at (2,6)\n\nAnd old P12 (1,6) vacated.\n\nSo now (2,6) is the tail position, with food on it.\n\nLife span of (2,6) food decreases to 4 at turn 40.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), new head (2,2), body seg1 at (2,3), seg2 at (3,3), ..., similarly, new seg12 at old P11 (2,6), so (2,6) becomes tail.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), new head (1,3), body seg1 at (2,3), seg2 at (3,3), ..., new seg12 at (2,6), again (2,6) becomes tail.\n\nIn all cases, after one move with no food eaten, (2,6) becomes the tail position.\n\nThen, on the next move, turn 40, if I move without eating, the tail will move off (2,6), and it will be vacated.\n\nFor example, at turn 40, from whatever position, if head moves and no food eaten, then new tail will be at the position of the previous segment, and (2,6) vacated.\n\nThen on turn 41, head can move to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nBut when head moves to (2,6), it eats the food, so snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and (2,6) is now part of the body, but since head is there, it's fine, no collision.\n\nBut there is a danger: tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the head is on the food, and the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is where the old tail was, but since head was adjacent, after growth, the head and new tail are adjacent, but that's not necessarily collision; collision is when head touches body, including itself.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nAfter eating, head moves to the food cell, which was tail, so now head is on that cell, and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail position, which is adjacent to the head position before the move, but after move, head is on the food cell, which was tail, so the new tail is at the old tail position, which might be adjacent to the new head position.\n\nFor example, suppose tail is at T, head at H adjacent to T.\n\nHead moves to T to eat food. After move, head is at T, and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the new tail is still at the old tail position? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place, so a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows by one, with the new segment at the old tail.\n\nPositions: old head H, old tail T, food at F.\n\nHead moves to F. If F is not T, then after move: new head at F, body segments: first body at old H, then next at old body positions, and tail at old T, but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the old tail position has a new segment, so the new tail is still at old T, and length increased.\n\nBut in this case, if F is T, and head moves to T, which has food.\n\nAfter move: new head at T (which was old tail), and the body: new segment 1 at old H, new segment 2 at old body 1, etc., up to the new tail at the position where the old tail was, but since food eaten, no movement of tail, so the old tail position has a new segment, and the segment that was second last is now the new tail? Let's think.\n\nStandard: when food eaten at F, head moves to F, and the tail does not move, so the new snake has the same body segments plus an additional segment at the old tail position.\n\nSo the cell F is occupied by new head, and the old tail position is occupied by a new body segment.\n\nIf F is the old tail position, then head moves to T, which is F, and a new segment is added at old T, but since head is moving to T, and new segment at T, but T is the same cell, so head and new segment are on the same cell? That can't be.\n\nClarify.\n\nCase 1: food not at tail position.\n\nHead moves to food cell F, which is free. Then new positions: head at F, body segments: seg1 at old head, seg2 at old seg1, ..., segN at old segN-1, and new segN+1 at old tail position. So old tail position is now occupied by new segment.\n\nCase 2: food at tail position.\n\nHead moves to tail position T, which has food. Since head moves to T, and T was occupied by tail, but when head moves there, the tail was there, but after move, new head at T, and the body: the first body segment is at old head position, and the old tail segment is gone or what?\n\nThe positions: old snake has positions P0 head, P1, P2, ..., Pk tail.\n\nHead moves to food at F, which is Pk, the tail position.\n\nAfter move: new head at Pk (old tail), and the new body segments: new seg1 at P0 (old head), new seg2 at P1 (old seg1), ..., new segk at Pk-1 (old segk-1), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at Pk, but Pk is where the head is, so it would have two segments on the same cell, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, it must be that when food is on the tail position, and head moves to it, since the head is moving to the tail cell, and the tail is there, but after eating, the tail doesn't move, but the head is now on that cell, so there is a collision immediately.\n\nThe rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nBut in this case, when head moves to the tail cell to eat food, the head and the tail are on the same cell after the move, which is a collision.\n\nSimilarly, even if not, the new segment added at old tail would be on the same cell as head if food was at tail.\n\nSo, it's dangerous to eat food on the tail position if head is adjacent, but in general, eating food on tail position might cause collision.\n\nSpecifically, the rule says only when head is adjacent to tail.\n\nBut let's read: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nSo only if head is adjacent to tail and food on tail cell.\n\nIf head is not adjacent, it might be safe to eat food on tail.\n\nFor example, head at (1,1), tail at (1,3), with body in between, food at (1,3). Head moves to (1,2) first, not adjacent to tail, then to (1,3) to eat. After move, head at (1,3), body seg1 at (1,2), which was old head, and new tail at (1,3) but head is there? No.\n\nOld positions: head (1,2), tail (1,3) with food.\n\nHead moves to (1,3) to eat. New head at (1,3), new body seg1 at old head (1,2), and since food eaten, new segment added at old tail (1,3), but (1,3) is where head is, so collision.\n\nTherefore, it is always dangerous to eat food on the tail cell, because after move, head and new segment would occupy the same cell if food was at tail.\n\nBut the rule only mentions when head is adjacent, but in this case, even if not adjacent, it might be a problem.\n\nThe rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nThe \"newly grown tail\" might mean the new segment added, which is at the old tail position.\n\nSo if head moves to the old tail position, and a new segment is added there, but head is already there, so collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat food on the tail cell without collision, because the head moves to that cell and a new segment is placed there.\n\nHence, food on tail cell cannot be eaten safely; it always causes collision if head moves to it.\n\nBut the rule specifies \"if the head is adjacent to the tail\", implying that if not adjacent, it might be possible, but from above, it seems not.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpret.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIt says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nAfter eating, the newly grown tail is at the old tail position, and the head is at the food position, which is the old tail position, so they are on the same cell, so collide.\n\nTherefore, whenever the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it to eat, they collide.\n\nIf the food is not on the tail cell, but head is adjacent to tail, and head moves to a different food, it might be ok.\n\nBut in this case, for (2,6), it will become the tail after one move.\n\nThen, if I try to eat it on turn 40 or later, it might be dangerous.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 39, after any move, (2,6) becomes the tail.\n\nThen at turn 40, if I move the head to (2,6), it would be eating food on tail cell, which causes collision, death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot directly eat (2,6) when it is tail.\n\nI need to eat it before it becomes tail or after it is vacated.\n\nBut it is currently body, not tail.\n\nTo eat it, I need head to move to (2,6) when it is free.\n\nAs earlier, after two moves with no food, it is vacated on turn 40, then on turn 41, head can move to it.\n\nAt that time, it is not tail, it is free cell with food.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nFor example, on turn 41, (2,6) is vacated, head moves to (2,6), eats food, snake grows, no problem.\n\nAnd since it is not the tail cell at that time, no issue with tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger only applies if eating the food on the tail cell when head is adjacent.\n\nBut when vacated, it's not tail cell, so safe.\n\nIn this case, for (2,6), we can eat it on turn 41.\n\nNow, back to turn 39 actions.\n\nI need to choose a move that allows me to reach (2,6) on turn 41 or when it's free.\n\nFirst, (2,6) will be vacated after turn 40 move, so free for turn 41.\n\nOn turn 41, head needs to be able to move to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), so head must be adjacent to it on turn 40 to move to it on turn 41.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,6): (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7) but y=7 wall, so (1,6), (3,6), (2,5).\n\n(1,6) is current tail, will be vacated soon.\n\n(3,6) is body, (2,5) is free? Let's see current free cells.\n\nAfter turn 39 move, the grid changes.\n\nI need to plan the moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 39, I have three choices: U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), then new head (2,4), and (2,6) becomes tail.\n\nThen on turn 40, I can move to positions adjacent to (2,4): U (2,5), D (2,3), L (1,4), R (3,4)\n\nBut (2,3) is now body, occupied by seg1, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\n(2,5) is free? Current state, (2,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) free, (3,4) free.\n\nAlso, direction: after moving U, new head direction is U, so for next turn, cannot move D (down), instant reverse.\n\nIf I move to (2,4) on turn 39, head direction U.\n\nThen turn 40, possible moves: U to (2,5), D not allowed, L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\n(2,5) is free, (1,4) free, (3,4) free.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 40, then from there, on turn 41, I can move to (2,6) if possible.\n\n(2,6) is adjacent to (2,5), so yes.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to other places.\n\nBut (2,6) is tail on turn 40, so if I move to (2,6) on turn 40, I would be eating food on tail cell, which kills, so I must not move to (2,6) on turn 40.\n\nOn turn 40, (2,6) is tail with food, so moving to it causes death.\n\nTherefore, on turn 40, I should not move to (2,6).\n\nInstead, I can move to (2,5) or (1,4) or (3,4), then on turn 41 to (2,6).\n\n(2,5) is free, so moving to (2,5) on turn 40 is safe.\n\nThen on turn 41, move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (1,4) on turn 40, then on turn 41, I can move to (1,5) or (1,3) or (2,4), but not directly to (2,6) since not adjacent. (1,4) to (2,6) is not adjacent, |dx|=1, |dy|=2, not adjacent. So I cannot reach (2,6) directly from (1,4).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4), not adjacent to (2,6).\n\nSo only if I go to (2,5) on turn 40, I can go to (2,6) on turn 41.\n\nNow, on turn 39, if I move U to (2,4), then on turn 40 I can move U to (2,5), then turn 41 to (2,6).\n\n(2,5) needs to be free and safe on turn 40.\n\nCurrently, (2,5) is free, no issue.\n\nBut after turn 39 move, what is the state?\n\nAfter turn 39 move U to (2,4):\n- New head: (2,4)\n- New body: seg1 at (2,3), seg2 at (3,3), seg3 at (4,3), seg4 at (5,3), seg5 at (6,3), seg6 at (6,4), seg7 at (6,5), seg8 at (6,6), seg9 at (5,6), seg10 at (4,6), seg11 at (3,6), seg12 at (2,6)  // tail with food\n- Vacated: (1,6)\n\nSo (2,5) is still free.\n\nOn turn 40, move U to (2,5): from (2,4) to (2,5), direction U.\n\nNew head (2,5), body seg1 at (2,4), seg2 at (2,3), seg3 at (3,3), ..., up to seg12 at (3,6)? Old positions from above: head (2,4), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (3,3), ..., seg11 (3,6), seg12 (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (2,5):\n- New head: (2,5)\n- New seg1: old head (2,4)\n- New seg2: old seg1 (2,3)\n- New seg3: old seg2 (3,3)\n- ...\n- New seg12: old seg11 (3,6)  // since old seg11 was (3,6)\n- And vacated old seg12 (2,6)  // but (2,6) had food, but not eaten since head not moved there\n\nNow, (2,6) is vacated and has food.\n\nThen on turn 41, head at (2,5), can move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nMove to (2,6): new head (2,6), eats food, so snake grows, no vacate, new tail at old tail position, which is (3,6).\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), seg1 at (2,5), seg2 at (2,4), seg3 at (2,3), seg4 at (3,3), ..., up to seg12 at (3,6), and new seg13 at old tail (3,6)? Old tail was (3,6), so new segment added at (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) was occupied by old seg11, which is now seg12 or something.\n\nAfter move: new head at (2,6), new seg1 at old head (2,5), new seg2 at old seg1 (2,4), new seg3 at old seg2 (2,3), new seg4 at old seg3 (3,3), ..., let's not list all, but the point is, no collision, and food eaten.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, if on turn 39 I move differently.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (2,2) on turn 39.\n\nThen new head (2,2), body seg1 at (2,3), seg2 at (3,3), ..., similarly, new seg12 at (2,6), tail with food.\n\nThen on turn 40, from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), but (2,3) is body (seg1), occupied, cannot. D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\n(2,3) is occupied, so U not possible.\n\nD to (2,1): if free, not wall, y=1, x=2, not obstacle, so free.\n\nL to (1,2): (1,2) has food, so if move to (1,2), eat food there, but we want to eat (2,6) later.\n\nBut (1,2) is food, so eating it now might be an option.\n\nBut let's first consider for (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,2), to reach (2,6) on turn 41, I need to be adjacent to (2,6) on turn 40.\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, (2,2) at y=2, not adjacent.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2): U not possible, D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\nNone of these are adjacent to (2,6), so on turn 40, I cannot be adjacent to (2,6), so on turn 41 I cannot move to (2,6) directly.\n\nMoreover, (2,6) will be vacated after turn 40 move, but if I am not near, I might not reach in time.\n\nLife span: (2,6) must be eaten by turn 43, so turn 41,42,43 possible.\n\nBut if I move D on turn 39, I am at (2,2), far from (2,6).\n\nThen I need to go up, but the body is in the way.\n\nFor example, after turn 39 move D to (2,2):\n- Head (2,2), body: seg1 (2,3), seg2 (3,3), ..., seg12 (2,6) tail.\n\nNow, from (2,2), I can move, say, L to (1,2) to eat food there, or D to (2,1), or R to (3,2).\n\nSuppose I move L to (1,2) on turn 40: eat (1,2) food, so snake grows.\n\nThen head at (1,2), body includes seg1 at (2,2), etc., and tail at (2,6) still? No, after eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nAfter turn 39: head (2,2), positions: head (2,2), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (3,3), ..., seg11 (3,6), seg12 (2,6) tail.\n\nMove to (1,2) on turn 40: (1,2) has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head (1,2), new body seg1 at old head (2,2), seg2 at old seg1 (2,3), ..., up to seg12 at old seg11 (3,6), and new seg13 at old tail (2,6). So (2,6) still occupied by new segment, not vacated.\n\nAnd food at (2,6) still there, but occupied.\n\nTo vacate (2,6), we need to not eat food so that tail moves off.\n\nBut here we ate (1,2), so (2,6) remains occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat on turn 40, say move to (2,1) or (3,2), then (2,6) vacated on turn 40, but I am at (2,1) or (3,2), far from (2,6), and on turn 41 I might not reach it.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) on turn 40, I can move to (1,1), (2,2), (3,1) but (3,1) obstacle, so (1,1) or (2,2).\n\n(2,2) was vacated? After turn 40 move.\n\nTurn 40 from (2,2) move to (2,1): head to (2,1), new seg1 at (2,2), new seg2 at (2,3), ..., new seg12 at (3,6), vacated (2,6).\n\nSo (2,6) vacated.\n\nBut head at (2,1), to reach (2,6), I need to go up, but the row y=3 has body from (2,3) to (6,3), so I need to go around, which takes many turns.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can go to (2,2) but (2,2) is now body? After above, new seg1 at (2,2), so occupied.\n\nPositions: after turn 40 move to (2,1): head (2,1), seg1 (2,2), seg2 (2,3), ..., up to seg12 at (3,6)\n\nSo (2,2) occupied, (2,3) occupied, etc.\n\nSo from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2) but occupied, L to (1,1), R to (3,1) obstacle, D to (2,0) wall, so only L to (1,1).\n\nThen from (1,1), can go to (1,2) or (1,0) wall, etc. But (1,2) has food but life span long, might be eaten later.\n\nBut to reach (2,6) from (1,1), it takes at least 5 moves: e.g., (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) or (2,6), but (1,6) might be free or not.\n\nAfter vacated, (1,6) was vacated earlier, but now might be occupied or not.\n\nComplicated, and (2,6) life span short, by turn 43, if I am at (1,1) on turn 41, I cannot reach (2,6) in time.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (3,2) on turn 40, similar issue.\n\nTherefore, moving D on turn 39 makes it hard to reach (2,6) in time.\n\nNow, if I move L to (1,3) on turn 39.\n\nThen new head (1,3), body seg1 at (2,3), seg2 at (3,3), ..., new seg12 at (2,6) tail.\n\nDirection: moved L, so head direction L.\n\nThen turn 40, possible moves: from (1,3), U to (1,4), D to (1,2), L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) but (2,3) is body (seg1), occupied, cannot.\n\nSo possible: U to (1,4), D to (1,2)\n\n(1,2) has food, so if move D, eat (1,2).\n\nBut again, if I eat (1,2), then (2,6) remains occupied.\n\nIf not, move U to (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 40, move U to (1,4), then new head (1,4), body seg1 at (1,3), etc., new seg12 at (3,6) or something, vacated (2,6).\n\n(2,6) vacated.\n\nBut head at (1,4), to move to (2,6) on turn 41, not adjacent, |dx|=1, |dy|=2, not possible.\n\nFrom (1,4), can move to (1,5) or (1,3) or (2,4).\n\n(1,5) might be free.\n\nThen to (1,6) or (2,5), etc., to reach (2,6) later, but on turn 41 not directly.\n\nSo only if I go to (2,5) on turn 40, I can go directly to (2,6) on turn 41.\n\nAnd to be at (2,5) on turn 40, I need to be at (2,4) or (1,5) or (3,5) or (2,6) on turn 39, but (2,6) occupied.\n\nOn turn 39, if I am at (2,4), I can go to (2,5) on turn 40.\n\n(2,4) is reachable by moving U from current.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), I can go to (1,4) on turn 40, but not to (2,5) directly.\n\nFrom (1,3), on turn 40, I can only go U to (1,4) or D to (1,2), neither is (2,5).\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,5) on turn 40 if I move L on turn 39.\n\nSimilarly, moving D, I go south, away.\n\nTherefore, the best choice on turn 39 is to move U to (2,4), so that on turn 40 I can move U to (2,5), then on turn 41 to (2,6) to eat.\n\nNow, about the other food at (1,2), it has life span 8, so I can eat it later after (2,6).\n\nBut I need to think about survival and long-term.\n\nAfter eating (2,6) on turn 41, snake is longer, and I need to find a path to eat (1,2) or other food.\n\nBut for now, with the life span constraint, (2,6) must be eaten soon.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,6), the snake will be in a different position.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 39: move U to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 40: move U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 41: move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nAfter that, I need to continue.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, but the format says to list actions starting from turn t1, so turn 39,40,41,... but I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAfter turn 41, head at (2,6), just ate, so direction U (since moved up to it).\n\nNow, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move D (down).\n\nU to (2,7) wall, not possible.\n\nD to (2,5), but (2,5) is now body, since after eating, seg1 is at (2,5), so occupied.\n\nAfter turn 41: head moved to (2,6), so positions: head (2,6), seg1 at (2,5), seg2 at (2,4), seg3 at (2,3), seg4 at (3,3), ..., and new tail at (3,6).\n\nSpecifically, from earlier: after turn 41 move to (2,6), head (2,6), body: seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,4), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (3,3), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (6,4), seg9 (6,5), seg10 (6,6), seg11 (5,6), seg12 (4,6), and seg13 (3,6) new tail.\n\nNow, from (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5) but occupied by seg1.\n\nL to (1,6), which might be free? After vacations, (1,6) was vacated earlier, so should be free.\n\nR to (3,6) but (3,6) is tail, occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (1,6), or R to (3,6) but occupied, or D occupied, U wall, so only L to (1,6) is possible? (1,6) should be free.\n\n(1,6) was vacated on turn 39 or 40, and not occupied since, so yes, free.\n\nAnd not wall.\n\nSo on turn 42, from (2,6), direction U, cannot move D, so move L to (1,6).\n\nThen head to (1,6), no food, so tail moves, etc.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (1,2) to eat the other food.\n\nBut (1,2) has life span 8, from turn 39, so at turn 42, life span 5? Turn 39: life span 8, turn 40:7, turn41:6, turn42:5, etc., so still time.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 39,40,41, and perhaps more, but the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence of actions, maybe 5 turns or so.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows multiple turns.\n\nBut for this, turn 39 to 41 are set to eat (2,6), then I need to continue.\n\nSince the food at (1,2) is important, I should head towards it after.\n\nBut after turn 42, head at (1,6) if I move L.\n\nThen from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5), L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6) but (2,6) is head or body? After turn 42, head at (1,6), body includes (2,6), so (2,6) occupied.\n\nSo only D to (1,5).\n\nThen to (1,4), etc., down to (1,2).\n\nBut I need to avoid the body.\n\nCurrently, after eating (2,6), the snake has segments around.\n\nBut since I can move down from (1,6) to (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and (1,2) has food, so I can eat it on turn 46 or something.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nSince the immediate goal is to eat (2,6), and moving U on turn 39 is the way.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise?\n\nFor example, if I move D or L, I might eat (1,2) first, but (1,2) has longer life, so better to eat (2,6) which is about to expire.\n\nPrioritize the food with shorter life span.\n\n(2,6) life span 5 at turn 39, so must eat soon.\n\n(1,2) life span 8, can wait.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,6), I have more length, but that might not be urgent.\n\nNow, another thing: internal obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant for now.\n\nSo for turn 39, move U.\n\nThen turn 40, move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 41, move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 42, from (2,6), only possible move L to (1,6), as above.\n\nThen turn 43, from (1,6), move D to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 44, from (1,5), move D to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 45, from (1,4), move D to (1,3)? (1,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter moves, let's not list all, but since I need to output actions.\n\nThe answer should be from turn 39 onwards.\n\nBut how many turns? Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output format shows multiple, I'll provide 5 turns: 39 to 43.\n\nBut at turn 43, I might be at (1,4) or something.\n\nSince after turn 41, I need to go to (1,2).\n\nAfter turn 41, head at (2,6), move L to (1,6) on turn 42.\n\nThen turn 43, from (1,6) move D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 44, from (1,5) move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 45, from (1,4) move D to (1,3)? (1,3) : at some point it might be occupied, but in the path, it should be free.\n\nInitially, (1,3) was free, and after moves, when I move to (1,6), (1,5), etc., (1,3) should be free until I reach it.\n\nSimilarly, turn 46, move D to (1,2) to eat, but life span at turn 46: original life span 8 at turn 39, turn 46 is 7 turns later? Turn 39:8, turn40:7, ..., turn46:1, so on turn 46, life span 1, can eat.\n\nBut for now, I'll output up to turn 43 or so.\n\nSince the sequence to eat (2,6) is fixed, I can start with that.\n\nNow, about the direction: after moving U on turn 39, head direction is U, so on turn 40, moving U is fine, not reverse.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 40 moving U to (2,5), direction U, then turn 41 moving U to (2,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 42, from (2,6) move L to (1,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 43, from (1,6) move D to (1,5), direction D.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nThen for subsequent, but I need to include in the answer.\n\nSince after turn 41, it's open, but to show thinking ahead, I can add a few more.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn the state, there might be other considerations, but I think this is fine.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,6), I lose a point, and it's easy to get.\n\nSo I think moving U on turn 39 is best.\n\nBut earlier I considered only U, but what about moving L to (1,3) and then to (1,2) to eat immediately.\n\nOn turn 39, move L to (1,3), then on turn 40, I can move D to (1,2) to eat the food there.\n\nThen I eat (1,2) on turn 40, get +1, length +1.\n\nBut (2,6) food might expire without eating, since I might not reach it in time.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I am at (1,2), and need to go to (2,6), but far, and body in between, hard to reach by turn 43.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) on turn 40, after eating, head at (1,2), body includes (1,3), (2,3), etc., so I can move U to (1,3) but occupied, or to (1,1), or (2,2) if free, but (2,2) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 39 move L to (1,3): head (1,3), body seg1 (2,3), seg2 (3,3), ..., seg12 (2,6) tail.\n\nThen turn 40 move D to (1,2): eat food at (1,2), so new head (1,2), new seg1 at (1,3), new seg2 at (2,3), ..., new seg12 at (3,6), new seg13 at (2,6) tail? Old tail (2,6), so new segment at (2,6), so (2,6) still occupied with food.\n\nThen to reach (2,6) later, it is still occupied, and to vacate it, I need to not eat food so tail moves off, but it might take time.\n\nMoreover, the segment at (2,6) is now part of the body, and to vacate, it needs to become tail and move off, which might be after many moves.\n\nBy turn 43, it might not be vacated, and food expires.\n\nSo I miss the (2,6) food.\n\nTherefore, better to eat (2,6) first.\n\nThus, the plan to move U on turn 39 is optimal.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nThen, as above, Turn 42: L (to (1,6))\n\nTurn 43: D (to (1,5))\n\nI could continue to Turn 44: D to (1,4), etc., but 5 turns from 39 to 43.\n\nTurn 39,40,41,42,43: that's 5 turns.\n\nActions: U, U, U, L, D\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (2,6) due to its short remaining life span (5 turns at turn 39, disappearing after turn 43). The food at (1,2) has a longer life span (8 turns) and can be targeted later. The snake's current position and direction limit immediate moves, but a sequence can be planned to safely eat (2,6) by turn 41 while avoiding collisions and walls.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 39)\n- **Snake Head**: (2,3), direction Left (L).\n- **Possible Moves**: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L). Right (R) is invalid due to no instant reverse.\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Occupied by the snake's body (segment 11). To eat it:\n  - (2,6) must be vacated first. This requires two moves with no food eaten: on turn 39, (2,6) becomes the tail; on turn 40, (2,6) is vacated after the tail moves off.\n  - Head must be adjacent to (2,6) on turn 40 to move there on turn 41 for eating.\n  - Life span: 5 at turn 39, so it must be eaten by turn 43 (present until turn 43, gone at turn 44).\n- **Food at (1,2)**: Life span 8 at turn 39, so it can be eaten later (e.g., by turn 46).\n- **Grid Constraints**: Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1). Playable area is (1,1) to (6,6).\n- **Risks**: \n  - Moving to (2,6) on turn 40 would cause death (tail reward danger, as it is the tail cell then).\n  - Body collisions must be avoided during movement.\n\n### Plan to Eat (2,6) Safely\n1. **Turn 39: Move U (to (2,4))** \n   - Why: Moves head to (2,4), which is safe and free. After move, (2,6) becomes the tail (no food eaten). Direction changes to U.\n   - Enables access to (2,5) on turn 40.\n\n2. **Turn 40: Move U (to (2,5))** \n   - Why: From (2,4), moving U to (2,5) is safe and free. No food eaten, so (2,6) is vacated (tail moves off). Direction remains U.\n   - Head is now adjacent to (2,6), setting up the eat on turn 41.\n\n3. **Turn 41: Move U (to (2,6))** \n   - Why: Eats the food at (2,6). Snake grows by 1 (score +1). Direction changes to U.\n   - (2,6) is now free and safe to move to (vacated on turn 40). No tail reward danger (not tail cell when eaten).\n\n### Post-Eating Plan for Survival and Further Scoring\nAfter eating (2,6), the snake must avoid walls and body collisions while navigating toward (1,2) for future scoring. The head is at (2,6) with direction U after turn 41. Possible moves:\n- U to (2,7): Wall, invalid.\n- D to (2,5): Occupied by body segment (seg1), invalid.\n- R to (3,6): Occupied by tail, invalid.\n- L to (1,6): Free and safe (vacated earlier).\n\nThus:\n4. **Turn 42: Move L (to (1,6))** \n   - Why: Only safe move. Direction changes to L.\n\n5. **Turn 43: Move D (to (1,5))** \n   - Why: From (1,6), moving D to (1,5) is safe and free. Direction changes to D. This starts the path toward (1,2) for future eating (life span allows).\n\n### Long-Term Consideration (5+ Turns Ahead)\n- **Beyond Turn 43**: Continue moving down to (1,4), (1,3), and (1,2) to eat the food there by ~turn 46 (life span 8 at turn 39, so eat by turn 46).\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No collisions: All moves avoid body and walls.\n  - Tail reward danger: Addressed by not eating (2,6) when it was the tail.\n  - Food expiration: (2,6) eaten in time; (1,2) can be reached later.\n- **Score Maximization**: Eating (2,6) yields +1; (1,2) can yield another +1 later. Survival is ensured by not taking risky moves.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\nThe actions for turns 39 to 43 are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: L \\\\\nTurn 43: D\n}",

        "score": 12,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 40, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). So the head is at (2,4) and the tail is at (2,6). The head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to get to (2,4) from (2,3), I assume? Let me confirm the movement.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ...]. Since the head is at (2,4) and the previous position was (2,3), which is directly below, so moving from (2,3) to (2,4) is Up. Yes, head direction is U.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (3,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has positive value +1, so no negative food here.\n\nThe food at (2,6) is interesting because (2,6) is currently occupied by the tail of the snake. Specifically, looking at snake positions: (2,6) is the last element, so it's the tail.\n\nNow, the rule about food under the body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. But for the tail, there's a special danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail grows and collides with the head.\n\nIn this case, the head is at (2,4), tail is at (2,6). Are they adjacent? Let's see the positions: (2,4), (2,3), ... (2,6). From (2,4) to (2,6) is not directly adjacent; there are other segments in between. The snake body is from (2,4) down to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on, up to (2,6).\n\nList the positions in order:\n\nIndex 0: head (2,4)\n\nIndex 1: (2,3)\n\nIndex 2: (3,3)\n\nIndex 3: (4,3)\n\nIndex 4: (5,3)\n\nIndex 5: (6,3)\n\nIndex 6: (6,4)\n\nIndex 7: (6,5)\n\nIndex 8: (6,6)\n\nIndex 9: (5,6)\n\nIndex 10: (4,6)\n\nIndex 11: (3,6)\n\nIndex 12: tail (2,6)\n\nSo the head is at (2,4), and tail at (2,6). The distance between head and tail: in terms of grid, (2,4) to (2,6) is two cells apart vertically, but not adjacent. Adjacent would be sharing an edge, like (2,4) and (2,5) or (2,3), etc.\n\n(2,4) and (2,6) are not adjacent; (2,5) is not a position, so they are separated.\n\nTherefore, the food at (2,6) is under the tail, but since head is not adjacent to tail, it might be possible to eat it later without immediate danger, but we need to consider the tail reward danger rule only when head is adjacent.\n\nNow, life span: food at (2,6) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn. So from turn 40, it will be gone by turn 44 if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) life span 7, gone by turn 47.\n\n(3,2) life span 10, gone by turn 50.\n\nAll food is positive, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1, except for negative food which isn't present.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders and internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake body occupies: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake positions: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nSo that's 13 segments.\n\nFood at: (2,6) but that's occupied by tail, (1,2), (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is near the internal wall at (3,1), but (3,2) is not a wall, so food is accessible.\n\nNow, head is at (2,4) facing Up. So possible moves: since facing Up, I can go Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be reverse, and rule says no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so cannot go D next.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nU: to (2,5)\n\nL: to (1,4)\n\nR: to (3,4)\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, (2,5): is it occupied or wall?\n\nGrid: y=5, x=2. Walls: borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (2,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacle at (3,1), not (2,5). Snake positions: (2,5) is not in the list. Current positions: (2,4), (2,3), etc., no (2,5). So (2,5) is free? But food is not there, so just empty cell.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): x=1,y=4, not border, not wall, not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4, not border, wall at (3,1) but (3,4) is different, not occupied by snake? Snake has (3,3), (3,6), but not (3,4). Positions: (3,3) and (6,4), etc., no (3,4). So all three possible moves seem safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, the food at (2,6) is under the tail. Since tail is at (2,6), and if the snake moves, the tail will move only if no food is eaten. If we don't eat food, tail moves forward, so the cell (2,6) will be vacated after the tail moves.\n\nLet's simulate the movement.\n\nOn each turn, the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. If no food, tail moves, so the last position is vacated.\n\nCurrently, food at (2,6) is under the tail. To eat it, we need the head to move to (2,6) after the tail has moved away.\n\nBut tail is at (2,6), and it will move only if no food is eaten in that turn.\n\nAlso, life span is decreasing.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 40, so it will disappear after turn 44, meaning it can be eaten on turns 40,41,42,43? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo at turn 40, life_span=4, so:\n\n- After turn 40, if not eaten, life_span becomes 3\n\n- After turn 41, life_span 2\n\n- After turn 42, life_span 1\n\n- After turn 43, life_span 0, so it disappears, cannot be eaten on turn 44.\n\nTypically, food can be eaten on the turn when life_span >0, and after eating or after countdown to 0, it's gone.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might mean it exists for N turns including the current one.\n\nLet's read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food with life_span L at turn t, it will be present until turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, life_span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until life_span=1, after that turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on any turn from t to t + L - 1.\n\nFor (2,6) at turn 40, life_span=4, so can be eaten on turns 40,41,42,43. Disappears after turn 43, so not on turn 44.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) life_span=7, can be eaten turns 40 to 46.\n\n(3,2) life_span=10, turns 40 to 49.\n\nNow back to eating (2,6). It's under tail. To eat it, we need the head to move to (2,6) when it is free and has food.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) is occupied by tail. When the snake moves, if we don't eat food, the tail moves to the next position. But the tail is at (2,6), and since the snake is moving, the tail will move to where the second last segment was, but only if no growth.\n\nLet's think about the snake movement.\n\nThe snake has segments: head, then body, then tail.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed if no food eaten, or stays if food eaten.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Choose direction for head to move to new cell.\n\n- If new cell has food and life_span >0, then eat: food disappears, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new head position, and new tail segment added? No.\n\nStandard Snake: when head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, meaning the segment that was tail remains, and head adds a new segment. So length increases by one.\n\nIf no food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed from its position.\n\nIn terms of positions list: if eat food, new head position added, and positions list gains one element (the new head), so tail position stays the same? Let's see.\n\nPositions: let’s say snake is [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new head position, then [H, B1, B2, ...] but the last element T is removed, so new positions [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., second_last], so tail was at T, now removed, new tail is second_last.\n\nAfter move with eating: new head position, and positions become [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so tail T remains, new segment added at head, so tail position doesn't change, but since we add at head, the tail cell is still occupied.\n\nIn this case, for food under tail, it is only accessible when the tail moves away, i.e., when we don't eat food, the tail vacates its cell.\n\nThen, if there is food on that cell, it can be eaten later when head moves there.\n\nBut for (2,6), it has food, but currently occupied.\n\nTo eat it, we need to vacate (2,6) first, then move head there later.\n\nVacate by not eating food for one turn, so tail moves.\n\nBut when tail moves, the cell (2,6) becomes free, but the food is there, so it's available to eat.\n\nThen head can move to it.\n\nBut we need to ensure that when head moves to (2,6), it is not colliding with body.\n\nNow, in this case, after tail moves, (2,6) is free, but head might not be adjacent to it immediately.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, the tail grows and occupies the same cell as head? No.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, head at (2,4), tail at (2,6), not adjacent, so no danger for now.\n\nBut if head were adjacent to tail, and we eat food on tail cell, it would cause collision.\n\nHere, not adjacent.\n\nNow, to eat (2,6), we need to move in such a way that after tail moves, head can go to (2,6).\n\nFirst, let's see where the tail will move.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ]\n\nThe tail is at (2,6), and it is connected to (3,6), which is the second last.\n\nThe direction: from (3,6) to (2,6) is left, so the tail is moving left to (2,6) from (3,6)? When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the head moves to new position, each segment moves forward, so the tail (2,6) will be removed, and the new tail will be the previous position of the second last segment, which is (3,6)? Let's think.\n\nAfter one move without eating:\n\n- Head moves to new position, say to (2,5) for example.\n\nThen new positions: new head at (2,5), then the old head (2,4) becomes the first body segment, then (2,3), then (3,3), and so on, up to (3,6), and the tail (2,6) is removed because no growth. The last segment was (2,6), but since we don't add a new segment, we remove the last one, so positions become: [new_head, (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6)] and (2,6) is vacated.\n\nThe second last was (3,6), which becomes the new tail.\n\nSo cell (2,6) is now free, and since food is there, it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut head is at (2,5) in this case, which is adjacent to (2,6).\n\n(2,5) and (2,6) are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf head is at (2,5) and we move to (2,6), that would eat the food.\n\nBut at that point, before eating, is the head adjacent to the tail? After the move, the tail is at (3,6), which is at (3,6), head at (2,5), so (2,5) and (3,6) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, but adjacency is only up/down/left/right, not diagonal. So not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, no tail reward danger.\n\nWe can eat it safely.\n\nBut in this case, if we go to (2,5) on this turn, then next turn to (2,6).\n\nBut let's see the life span: at turn 40, we can eat on turn 40,41,42,43.\n\nIf we go to (2,5) on turn 40, that's moving to an empty cell, no food, so no eat, tail moves, (2,6) vacated.\n\nThen on turn 41, head at (2,5), we can move to (2,6) to eat food.\n\n(2,6) has food with life span, after turn 40, if not eaten, life span decreases to 3, but on turn 41 it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nBut we have other food to consider.\n\nAlso, need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (2,4) facing U.\n\nOptions: U to (2,5), L to (1,4), R to (3,4)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each.\n\nU to (2,5): as above, empty cell, no food, so after move, snake moves, tail at (2,6) vacates, new tail at (3,6). Head now at (2,5), facing U? Head direction: after moving U, new direction is U.\n\nThen from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\n(2,6) now has food and is free, so moving U to (2,6) eats food, increases length.\n\nL to (1,5) or R to (3,5) both possible, but (2,6) is tempting.\n\nBut we need to think if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating at (2,6), the snake grows, so positions: new head at (2,6), then previous head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), etc., and tail stays at (3,6)? When we eat, we add a new segment at head, so positions become: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), (2,6) but (2,6) is new head, and the old tail (3,6) remains, so now tail is at (3,6), and we have a new segment at head.\n\nOriginal positions before eating at (2,6): let's say after turn 40 move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)  // 12 segments? Original 13, after move no eat, we have 12 segments: new head (2,5), then old head (2,4), ..., up to (3,6) as tail.\n\nList: indices after move without eat: [new_head, pos0, pos1, ..., pos11] where pos0 was head, now body, pos11 was second last, now tail.\n\nOriginal: pos0=(2,4), pos1=(2,3), pos2=(3,3), pos3=(4,3), pos4=(5,3), pos5=(6,3), pos6=(6,4), pos7=(6,5), pos8=(6,6), pos9=(5,6), pos10=(4,6), pos11=(3,6), pos12=(2,6) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,5) without eating: new positions: head = (2,5), then body: pos0=(2,4), pos1=(2,3), pos2=(3,3), ..., up to pos11=(3,6), and tail pos12 is removed. So positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)] so 13 segments? No: original 13 segments, after move no eat, we remove tail, so 12 segments.\n\nCount: new head + 12 body segments, but the body segments are the first 12 of original, minus the tail.\n\nOriginal 13 positions: index 0 to 12.\n\nAfter move: new head at (2,5), then positions from index 0 to 11 become the body, so segments: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — that's 13 positions? (2,5) new, then (2,4) old head, (2,3) index1, ..., (3,6) index11, and index12 (2,6) is removed. So the positions are: new head (2,5), and then old positions from 0 to 11: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). That's 12 segments? New head + 11 body + tail? Let's list: 1. (2,5) head, 2. (2,4), 3. (2,3), 4. (3,3), 5. (4,3), 6. (5,3), 7. (6,3), 8. (6,4), 9. (6,5), 10. (6,6), 11. (5,6), 12. (4,6), 13. (3,6) tail. (3,6) is the last, which was index11, now tail. So 13 segments? I think I confused.\n\nOriginal positions: 13 segments.\n\nWhen moving without eating food:\n\n- Head moves to new cell.\n\n- Each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\n- The tail segment (last) is removed.\n\nSo the new positions list has one fewer segment.\n\nFor example, from positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with N segments.\n\nAfter move to new_head without eating: new positions [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{N-2}] , where B_{N-2} is the new tail, and T is removed.\n\nHere N=13, positions: H = (2,4), B1 = (2,3), B2 = (3,3), B3 = (4,3), B4 = (5,3), B5 = (6,3), B6 = (6,4), B7 = (6,5), B8 = (6,6), B9 = (5,6), B10 = (4,6), B11 = (3,6), T = (2,6)\n\nAfter moving head to new cell, say (2,5), without eating:\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nThen new body: H becomes first body: (2,4)\n\nThen B1: (2,3)\n\nB2: (3,3)\n\n...\nUp to B11: (3,6)\n\nAnd T (2,6) is removed, not included.\n\nSo new positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]  // 13 positions? From (2,5) to (3,6), that's 13 cells, but we have new head and 12 old positions from index 0 to 11, which is 13 segments? Index 0 to 12 original, after move, new head and positions from 0 to 11, so 1 + 12 = 13 segments, but we removed the tail, so it should be 12.\n\nOriginal: 13 segments.\n\nAfter move without eating: we add a new head position, and remove the tail position, so net change -0, still 13 segments? No.\n\nWhen we add new head, the list becomes [new_head, old_head, old_B1, ..., old_B11], and old_T is removed. Old_head to old_B11 is 12 positions, plus new_head, 13, but old_B11 was the second last, which is now the last, tail.\n\nIn terms of count, number of segments remains the same when no eating, because head moves, tail moves, so same length.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard Snake: when no food eaten, snake moves to new cell, the tail cell is vacated, but the length remains the same, so the number of segments is constant.\n\nPositions: for a snake of length L, positions list has L elements.\n\nAfter moving without eating: new positions list has L elements: new head, and the first L-1 elements of the old positions list.\n\nFor example, old positions: [P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1}] with P0 head, P_{L-1} tail.\n\nAfter moving to new cell Q without eating: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{L-2}], so the new tail is P_{L-2}, and P_{L-1} is vacated.\n\nLength L remains.\n\nWith eating: new positions [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{L-1}], length L+1, tail P_{L-1} remains.\n\nIn this case, L=13.\n\nAfter move to (2,5) without eating: new positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ] because P_{L-2} is index 11, (3,6), which becomes new tail, and (2,6) vacated.\n\nYes.\n\nSo cell (2,6) is now free and has food.\n\nHead at (2,5), facing U (since we moved U).\n\nFrom here, we can move U to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\n(2,6) is now free, so moving to it eats the food, and since head at (2,5) is adjacent to (2,6), and tail is at (3,6), not adjacent to head, so no tail reward danger, safe to eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows to length 14, positions: new head at (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), and the old tail (3,6) remains, so now tail is at (3,6), but (3,6) is still there, and new segment at (2,6), so positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ] so tail still at (3,6).\n\nLength 14.\n\nNow, back to turn 40 decision.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5) on turn 40, then on turn 41 I can move U to (2,6) to eat the food at (2,6).\n\nLife span is 4 at turn 40, so on turn 41, after turn 40, life span decreases to 3, so can be eaten on turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, I could move directly to eat other food, but (2,6) is close.\n\nOther options: move L to (1,4) or R to (3,4).\n\n(1,4) is empty, no food.\n\n(3,4) is empty, no food.\n\nBut there is food at (1,2) and (3,2), which are below.\n\nHead at (2,4), if I move U to (2,5), I go away from those foods.\n\nIf I move L or R, I might go towards them.\n\nBut (2,6) food has short life span, only 4 turns, while others have 7 and 10, so (2,6) is urgent to eat soon.\n\nAlso, by eating it, I get +1 and grow, which is good.\n\nBut let's check if there are risks.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), that's safe.\n\nThen to (2,6), also safe as above.\n\nAfter that, head at (2,6), facing U.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: U, but y=6, U would be (2,7), but y=7 is wall, since border y=7, so (2,7) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nD: to (2,5), but (2,5) is the neck, which is the body segment right behind head, so moving D would cause collision with body at (2,5).\n\nL: to (1,6)\n\nR: to (3,6)\n\n(3,6) is the tail, but after eating, tail is at (3,6), which is adjacent? (2,6) and (3,6) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), that would be moving onto the tail cell.\n\nBut (3,6) has no food now, since we just ate at (2,6), and (3,6) is occupied by tail.\n\nSo moving to (3,6) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (2,5) collides with body.\n\nMoving L to (1,6) might be possible.\n\n(1,6) is within bounds, x=1,y=6, not wall, and not occupied, since only snake positions are as above.\n\nAfter eating at (2,6), positions include (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), etc., and (3,6), no (1,6), so (1,6) free.\n\nSo from (2,6), after eating, head at (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, invalid; D to (2,5) body, collision; L to (1,6) free; R to (3,6) body, collision. So only possible move is L to (1,6).\n\nThen we must go L to (1,6).\n\nThen head at (1,6), facing L? After moving L, direction L.\n\nThen from there, we can go U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\nU to (1,7) wall; D to (1,5); L to (0,6) wall since x=0; R to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, collision.\n\n(2,6) is the previous position, now body segment.\n\nSo from (1,6), possible moves: U wall, D to (1,5), L wall, R body. Only D to (1,5) is possible.\n\n(1,5) should be free? After previous positions, (1,5) not occupied, yes.\n\nSo move D to (1,5).\n\nThen head at (1,5), facing D? After moving D from (1,6), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (1,6) which is the neck, body; D to (1,4); L to (0,5) wall; R to (2,5) body. So only D to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) might be free or not.\n\nInitially, on turn 40, if we go this path, on turn 40 move U to (2,5), turn 41 move U to (2,6) eat, then turn 42 move L to (1,6), turn 43 move D to (1,5), turn 44 move D to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) was where? On turn 40, head was at (2,4), we moved to (2,5), so (1,4) was not occupied, and after moves, it might be free.\n\nBut let's not simulate too far yet.\n\nThe point is, after eating at (2,6), we are forced to go left and down, which might lead to dead end or something.\n\n(1,4) is at bottom left, and there is food at (1,2), which is below.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nPerhaps better to consider other initial moves.\n\nAnother option: on turn 40, move L to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is empty, no food.\n\nThen head at (1,4), facing L (since we moved L).\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4) which is body? (2,4) was previous head, now body segment.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4) without eating, positions: new head (1,4), then old head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), ..., up to (3,6), and (2,6) vacated? Since no eat, tail (2,6) removed, new tail (3,6).\n\nPositions: [(1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead at (1,4), body at (2,4), etc.\n\nFrom (1,4), moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), L wall, R to (2,4) body, collision. So only U or D.\n\nU to (1,5) or D to (1,3).\n\n(1,5) free, (1,3) free? Not occupied.\n\nThen, we can go towards food at (1,2), which is below.\n\n(1,2) is food, life span 7.\n\nFrom (1,4), if we go D to (1,3), then to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the tail food.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), (2,6) is vacated, food at (2,6) is still there, but head is at (1,4), not adjacent, so we can go to (2,6) later? But from (1,4), to go to (2,6), it's not direct, and life span short.\n\nSimilarly, if we move R to (3,4) on turn 40.\n\n(3,4) empty.\n\nThen head at (3,4), facing R.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4) body, R to (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is body, so cannot go L.\n\nU (3,5), D (3,3), R (4,4).\n\n(3,3) is body? Positions after move: new head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc., so (3,3) is body segment, so D to (3,3) collision.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) free, (4,4) free.\n\nThen we can go towards (3,2) food.\n\nBut (3,2) is near (3,1) wall, so need to be careful.\n\nNow, comparing all, the food at (2,6) has short life span, so it might be best to eat it soon.\n\nAlso, it's easy to get: by going U to (2,5), then U to (2,6).\n\nIf I go directly to other places, I might miss it.\n\nMoreover, after eating it, I grow, which might be useful.\n\nBut as I saw, after eating at (2,6), I am forced to go left to (1,6), then down to (1,5), etc., which might lead to the left side, where there is food at (1,2).\n\nWhereas if I go down or right, I can go to other foods.\n\nBut let's think about risks and long-term.\n\nFirst, the internal wall at (3,1), so around (3,2) might be tight.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the bottom and right, so the top-left is relatively free.\n\nCurrent occupied cells: (2,4),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6),(5,6),(4,6),(3,6),(2,6)\n\nSo the area around (1,y) for y=4 to6 might be free, and (1,2) etc.\n\nAlso, (3,4) to (5,4) free, etc.\n\nFood at (1,2) and (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is above the wall at (3,1), so (3,2) is accessible, but moving down from (3,2) to (3,1) is wall, so need to approach from sides.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is corner, x=1,y=2, borders x=0,y=0 nearby.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nSince (2,6) food has only 4 turns life, and it's under tail, I should prioritize eating it.\n\nSo on turn 40, move U to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 41, move U to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nNow, for turn 42, after eating, head at (2,6), and as before, only possible move is L to (1,6).\n\nThen on turn 43, from (1,6), only D to (1,5).\n\nThen on turn 44, from (1,5), only D to (1,4), since U to (1,6) body, L wall, R to (2,5) body? After moves, on turn 42: head to (1,6), positions: after eating at turn 41, head at (2,6), positions as above.\n\nAfter turn 41 eat at (2,6): positions [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]\n\nHead at (2,6), direction U? Last move was U to (2,6), so facing U.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (1,6), so new head (1,6), facing L.\n\nPositions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ] length 14.\n\nNow from (1,6), moves: U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5), L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6) body. So only D to (1,5).\n\nMove D to (1,5), turn 43.\n\nNew head (1,5), facing D.\n\nPositions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ] and tail at (3,6)? Last is (4,6) or? Positions list: new head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), ..., up to (4,6), and (3,6) is still there? From previous, after turn 42, positions included (3,6), but when we move, without eating, since (1,5) no food, so no eat, move to (1,5), new positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ] and tail (3,6) is removed? Old positions had (3,6) as last, but in the list above, after turn 41, positions end with (3,6), so when moving to (1,5) without eating, new head (1,5), then old head (1,6)? After turn 42, head was at (1,6), positions: let's index.\n\nAfter turn 41: positions P0=(2,6), P1=(2,5), P2=(2,4), P3=(2,3), P4=(3,3), P5=(4,3), P6=(5,3), P7=(6,3), P8=(6,4), P9=(6,5), P10=(6,6), P11=(5,6), P12=(4,6), P13=(3,6)  // 14 segments\n\nTurn 42 move L to (1,6): eat? (1,6) has food? No, not specified, so no, empty. So no eat, move to (1,6), new positions: new head (1,6), then P0=(2,6), P1=(2,5), P2=(2,4), P3=(2,3), P4=(3,3), P5=(4,3), P6=(5,3), P7=(6,3), P8=(6,4), P9=(6,5), P10=(6,6), P11=(5,6), P12=(4,6)  // P13=(3,6) removed, so new tail is P12=(4,6)\n\nPositions: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead (1,6), tail (4,6)\n\nTurn 43 move D to (1,5): (1,5) empty, no eat, new head (1,5), then old head (1,6), then P0=(2,6), P1=(2,5), ..., up to P12=(4,6), but P12 is (4,6), which was tail, now part of body, and the last of old positions is (4,6), which is P12, but after remove tail, which was (4,6)? After turn 42, positions: index 0: (1,6) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,6), 12: (5,6), 13: (4,6) tail\n\nMove to (1,5) without eating: new head (1,5), then positions from index 0 to 12: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and index 13 (4,6) removed. So new positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)\n\nHead at (1,5), facing D.\n\nNow turn 44, from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6) which is the neck, body segment, collision; D to (1,4); L to (0,5) wall; R to (2,5) which is body? (2,5) is in positions, index 3: (2,5), yes body, so collision. So only possible move is D to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) should be free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nMove D to (1,4).\n\nThen head at (1,4), facing D.\n\nFrom here, we can go to (1,3), etc. towards (1,2) food.\n\n(1,2) food is at y=2, so we can go down.\n\nBut we need to think beyond 5 turns.\n\nSince the question is to output actions for turns starting from t1=40, and think ahead, but output for multiple turns, but not specified how many, but in answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence.\n\nBut how many? At least for the immediate actions to eat the food or something.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince (2,6) food is urgent, let's plan to eat it.\n\nSo on turn 40: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 41: move U to (2,6) to eat\n\nThen turn 42: move L to (1,6)  // only choice\n\nThen turn 43: move D to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 44: move D to (1,4)\n\nNow from (1,4), facing D, we can move D to (1,3) or U to (1,5) but (1,5) is body, or L wall, R to (2,4) which may be body.\n\nAfter turn 44 move to (1,4): let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 43: head at (1,5), positions as above.\n\nAfter move to (1,4) without eating (assuming no food), new head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), ..., up to (5,6), and tail removed, etc.\n\nBut (1,4) is empty, no food mentioned, so no eat.\n\nThen from (1,4), moves: U to (1,5) body, collision; D to (1,3); L wall; R to (2,4). Now (2,4) might be occupied.\n\nIn positions, after move, (2,4) is part of body, so collision if move R.\n\nSo only D to (1,3).\n\nThen to (1,2) to eat food there.\n\n(1,2) has food, so can eat on turn 46 or something.\n\nBut life span is 7, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, we have (3,2) food.\n\nBut after going left, we might be away from (3,2).\n\nPerhaps on turn 40, instead of U, I could move in a way to eat (2,6) later or go for other food.\n\nBut (2,6) has short life, so better to eat it now.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 40, move directly to a position to eat (2,6) on turn 40, but it's occupied, so cannot.\n\nMust vacate first.\n\nSo minimum two turns: first move away to vacate, then move back.\n\nBut in this case, moving U to (2,5) vacates (2,6) and sets up to eat next turn.\n\nIf I move L or R, (2,6) is vacated too, but head is farther, so it might take more turns to reach, and life span short.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (1,4) on turn 40, (2,6) vacated, but head at (1,4), to go to (2,6), I need to go right and up, but from (1,4) to (2,6) is two moves: e.g., U to (1,5), then R to (2,5), but (2,5) might be occupied later, or directly? From (1,4) to (2,6) not adjacent, so need at least two moves, but after vacating, on turn 41, head at (1,4), I can move U to (1,5), then turn 42 move R to (2,5), then turn 43 move U to (2,6) if food still there.\n\nBut life span: at turn 40, life span 4, after turn 40, to 3; turn 41, to 2; turn 42, to 1; turn 43, to 0 after turn, so on turn 43, before move, life span 1, can eat, but after move, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nOn turn 43, if I move to (2,6), it can be eaten if life span >0.\n\nAt start of turn 43, life span=1, so I can eat it.\n\nBut I need to reach by turn 43.\n\nFrom above: turn 40 move L to (1,4), vacate (2,6)\n\nTurn 41 move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 42 move R to (2,5)\n\nTurn 43 move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly possible, but takes one more turn, and I have to go through (1,5) and (2,5), which might be occupied, but in this case, after vacating, (2,5) might be free initially, but after moves, it could be occupied by body.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 40 move L to (1,4), positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,6), tail (4,6) or something, (2,6) vacated.\n\n(2,5) not occupied.\n\nTurn 41 move U to (1,5), new head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), etc., (2,5) free.\n\nTurn 42 move R to (2,5), new head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), etc.\n\nThen turn 43 move U to (2,6), eat.\n\nBut compared to the first approach, I eat on turn 41 vs turn 43, and in first approach I eat on turn 41, here on turn 43, which is later, but life span allows, turn 43 is ok.\n\nBut in first approach, I eat earlier and have more time for other things.\n\nAlso, in first approach, after eating, I go left, which is towards (1,2) food.\n\nIn second approach, after eating at (2,6) on turn 43, I am at (2,6), same as before, forced to go left.\n\nBut I wasted turns going to (1,4) and back.\n\nSo better to go directly U on turn 40.\n\nMoreover, by going U, I stay in a position to eat other foods later.\n\nNow, about the other food: (1,2) and (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is at bottom left, (3,2) is near the obstacle.\n\nAfter eating (2,6) and going left, I can head down to (1,2).\n\n(3,2) might be harder to reach from there.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to eat (3,2) later.\n\nLife span 10, so many turns.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think for turn 40: U\n\nThen turn 41: U to eat\n\nThen turn 42: L\n\nThen turn 43: D\n\nThen turn 44: D\n\nBut I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is eaten on turn 41, and we have actions up to turn 44.\n\nBut turn 44 is t1+4, so 5 turns including t1.\n\nt1=40, so turns 40,41,42,43,44.\n\nActions: 40: U, 41: U, 42: L, 43: D, 44: D\n\nBut on turn 44, after moving to (1,4), we can go to (1,3) next, but not in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should include one more to show going to food.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better way.\n\nAnother option: on turn 40, move R to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4), facing R.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5) or (4,4), but not down to (3,3) body.\n\n(3,5) free, (4,4) free.\n\nThen from there, to reach (2,6), it might take longer, and life span short.\n\nFor example, to go to (2,6) from (3,4): need to go left and up, but (2,4) might be body.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,4) not efficient for (2,6).\n\nSo best to go U on turn 40.\n\nMoreover, by going U, I might be able to access other areas.\n\nAfter going to (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), then I can go down to (1,3), (1,2) to eat that food.\n\n(1,2) life span 7, at turn 40, so by turn 46 can eat, so on turn 45 or 46 I can be there.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) can be eaten later.\n\nBut there might be a risk in the left corridor.\n\nFor example, after going to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (1,2) eat.\n\nBut (1,2) is at corner, after eating, head at (1,2), then where to go?\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,3) body, D to (1,1), L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) might be free, (2,2) might be free.\n\nBut need to avoid walls.\n\nSince internal wall at (3,1), (3,2) is food, so from (2,2) I can go to (2,1) or (3,2), but (3,2) has food, and (2,1) might be wall? Borders, y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is not wall, x=2,y=1.\n\nWalls: x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 borders, and (3,1) internal.\n\nSo (2,1) is free, (3,2) free.\n\nBut (3,1) is wall, so from (3,2), cannot go down.\n\nI can go to (3,2) from (2,2) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBut not immediate concern.\n\nFor now, I think the sequence to eat (2,6) is good.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 40: U (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 41: U (to (2,6) eat)\n\nTurn 42: L (to (1,6))\n\nTurn 43: D (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 44: D (to (1,4))\n\nBut on turn 44, after moving to (1,4), we can go D to (1,3) on next turn, but not in the sequence.\n\nSince the food at (1,2) is there, I can extend.\n\nBut the output should be for turns starting from t1, and I need to specify actions.\n\nPerhaps 5 actions for 5 turns.\n\nt1 to t1+4.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can provide for as many as I want, but at least to show the plan.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I can provide for the critical part.\n\nI think 5 turns are fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,6) is under tail, and by eating it, we avoid missing it.\n\nAlso, all food positive, no negative.\n\nSo I think U on 40 is best.\n\nBut on turn 40, moving U to (2,5), is there any risk? (2,5) free, no wall, no body, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, next moves.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: D\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n\nBut in turn 42, we move L to (1,6), which is necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving differently after eating, but no choice.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the food life spans and avoiding collisions. The food at (2,6) has a short life span of 4 (disappearing after turn 43) and is currently under the tail. Eating it requires vacating the cell first and then moving the head there, which can be achieved in two turns. The other foods at (1,2) and (3,2) have longer life spans (7 and 10, respectively), so they can be targeted later. Moving up on turn 40 vacates (2,6) and positions the head to eat it on turn 41. After eating, the snake is forced left due to body and wall constraints, but this path also leads toward the food at (1,2). The sequence below ensures the snake eats the high-urgency food at (2,6) while setting up for future opportunities.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 40 (Current State)**:\n  - Head at (2,4), facing Up.\n  - Possible moves: Up (to (2,5)), Left (to (1,4)), Right (to (3,4)).\n  - Moving Up to (2,5) is safe (empty cell) and vacates (2,6) for eating next turn. Left or Right moves delay eating (2,6) and risk missing it due to short life span.\n\n- **Turn 41**:\n  - After moving Up to (2,5), head is at (2,5), facing Up.\n  - (2,6) is now free and has food (life span 3 after turn 40, so edible).\n  - Moving Up to (2,6) eats the food (+1 score, length increases). No tail reward danger (head at (2,5) not adjacent to tail at (3,6)).\n\n- **Turn 42**:\n  - After eating, head at (2,6), facing Up.\n  - Possible moves: Up (to (2,7) wall, invalid), Down (to (2,5) body, collision), Left (to (1,6)), Right (to (3,6) body, collision).\n  - Only Left to (1,6) is safe.\n\n- **Turn 43**:\n  - Head at (1,6), facing Left.\n  - Possible moves: Up (to (1,7) wall, invalid), Down (to (1,5)), Left (to (0,6) wall, invalid), Right (to (2,6) body, collision).\n  - Only Down to (1,5) is safe.\n\n- **Turn 44**:\n  - Head at (1,5), facing Down.\n  - Possible moves: Up (to (1,6) body, collision), Down (to (1,4)), Left (to (0,5) wall, invalid), Right (to (2,5) body, collision).\n  - Only Down to (1,4) is safe. This moves toward (1,2) food (life span 7, edible until turn 46).\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond 5 Turns):\n- After turn 44, head at (1,4), facing Down. Move Down to (1,3) on turn 45, then to (1,2) on turn 46 to eat the food if still present. The food at (3,2) can be targeted later (life span 10, edible until turn 49) by navigating via (2,2) or (4,2), avoiding the internal wall at (3,1).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 41: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 42: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 43: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 44: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t1 = 41.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls occupy these, I can't go to those coordinates. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, cells I can't move into: all where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and specifically (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (2,5), then body segments: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the snake has 13 segments. Head at (2,5), tail at (3,6).\n\nHead direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,6) with life span 3 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,2) with life span 6 and value +1\n\n- (3,2) with life span 9 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nLife span: for (2,6), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 41, life span 3, so it will be there on turn 41, 42, 43, and disappear before turn 44? Let me clarify the life span countdown.\n\nIt says: \"life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (2,6) with life_span=3 on turn 41: on turn 41, countdown=3; turn 42, countdown=2; turn 43, countdown=1; turn 44, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 44? Or after turn 43?\n\nTypically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N turns, including the current one. But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so if life_span is L on turn t, it will be present until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on the turn it's spawned, countdown is L. After that turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then it disappears.\n\nFor (2,6) on turn 41: countdown=3, so it will be there for turn 41, 42, 43; on turn 44, countdown=0, so it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): life_span=6 on turn 41, so present until turn 46.\n\n(3,2): life_span=9, present until turn 49.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for turns 41, 42, 43, etc., but the output should be for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead, but I think I need to specify actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, and so on. But how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but in the output, it might be a sequence. I think I should provide a sequence for several turns, but since the state might change, I need to simulate based on current info.\n\nI should plan a sequence of moves for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding death.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Grid size: from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls on borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so valid cells are x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6. But (3,1) is an obstacle, so (3,1) is blocked.\n\ny=1 is the bottom row? Let's define coordinates. Typically, y=0 might be top or bottom, but in the snake positions, we have (2,5), (2,4), etc., and head direction U (up) from (2,5) to... current head is (2,5), moving U, which is (x,y+1)? The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n\nIn standard coordinates, y+1 might be up or down, but here U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up, decreasing y is down. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right, so x=1 to 6.\n\nIn the snake positions, head at (2,5), which is x=2, y=5. Moving U, which is to (2,6), since U (x,y+1).\n\nBut (2,6) is at y=6, which is the top row? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row of playable area.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is in positions, which is top-right corner playable.\n\nNow, food: (2,6) is at (2,6), which is directly above the head at (2,5). Since head is at (2,5) moving U, if I move U now, I go to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has food with value +1 and life span 3.\n\nBut I need to check if I can eat it safely.\n\nFirst, movement constraints: head direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite to U, and no instant reverse. So possible moves from current: U, L, R. Not D.\n\nNow, let's list possible actions for turn 41.\n\nCurrent head: (2,5)\n\nAfter move:\n\n- If U: go to (2,6)\n\n- If L: go to (1,5)  (since L (x-1,y))\n\n- If R: go to (3,5)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nFirst, walls: x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, and (3,1) obstacle.\n\nFor (2,6): x=2, y=6. y=6 is not y=7, so not wall. x=2 between 1 and 6, so ok. But is it occupied? (2,6) is a food position, but food can be under body? Let's see snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]\n\n(2,6) is not in this list; it's a food cell, not occupied by snake. But food can spawn under body, but here (2,6) is not under snake; it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) and (3,2) are also not in snake positions.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is not in the snake body segments listed. Snake has (6,6) and (5,6), etc., but (2,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) and (3,2) are free.\n\nNow, if I move U to (2,6), I will eat the food there, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: since positive food, length increases by one, so new head at (2,6), and tail stays? When you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; the head moves to the food, and since it's eaten, a new segment is added, but the movement happens: head moves to new position, if food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: each turn, head moves to new cell. If that cell has food, food is eaten, and snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added. If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,6), which has food, I eat it, so head at (2,6), and the body: the previous head (2,5) becomes part of body, and since food eaten, no tail movement, so tail stays at (3,6), and new segment will be added when? After the move, the snake positions update: new head at (2,6), previous head (2,5) now second segment, and so on, down to tail. Since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays, effectively adding a new segment at the tail position.\n\nSo after eating, snake length increases by one, tail position remains until next move.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), ..., (3,6) ]\n\nAfter moving U and eating food at (2,6):\n\nNew head: (2,6)\n\nThen body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ..., up to the tail (3,6) remains, and since food eaten, no tail movement, so the tail (3,6) stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nTypically: the head moves to new cell. If food eaten, the tail does not move, so the snake gains a segment. The new positions are: [new_head] + previous positions, but the last element (tail) is not removed.\n\nSo positions become: [ (2,6) ] + [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]  so now 14 segments, with tail still at (3,6).\n\nYes.\n\nIf no food eaten, the tail moves off its position.\n\nNow, back to moving to (2,6): is it safe?\n\n(2,6) is within bounds, not wall, and not occupied by body, since no body there.\n\nBut after moving, the head is at (2,6), and the body includes (2,5), which is adjacent, but that's fine, as long as not colliding.\n\nNow, but there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIt says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (3,6), and we're moving to (2,6), which is adjacent? (2,6) and (3,6) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nHead moving to (2,6), tail is at (3,6). Are they adjacent? Yes, since |dx|=1, dy=0, so adjacent.\n\nNow, if we eat food at (2,6), which is not the tail cell; the tail cell is (3,6), which may or may not have food.\n\n(3,6) is currently part of the snake, so no food there. The food is at (2,6), which we're moving to.\n\nThe Tail Reward Danger is about eating food that is on the tail cell, but only if head is adjacent and moves to it.\n\nLet me read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nHere, tail cell is (3,6), and it does not have food; the food is at (2,6). So this doesn't apply.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the tail remains at (3,6), so no immediate collision.\n\nThen next turn, when we move, the tail might move or not.\n\nBut for now, moving to (2,6) seems safe for the immediate move.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all food:\n\n- Food at (2,6): life span 3, so available on turns 41,42,43; gone on 44.\n\n- Food at (1,2): life span 6, available turns 41 to 46.\n\n- Food at (3,2): life span 9, available turns 41 to 49.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), I eat the food, gain +1, length to 14.\n\nThen head at (2,6), direction U (since I moved U).\n\nFrom there, I can move U, but y=6, U would be (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot move U. So from (2,6), possible moves: D (down, to (2,5)), but (2,5) is now the second segment, so if I move D to (2,5), I collide with body, death.\n\nL to (1,6), or R to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is the current tail position.\n\nAfter we move to (2,6) and eat, positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), ..., (3,6)\n\n(3,6) is the tail.\n\nIf from (2,6) I move R to (3,6), what happens?\n\n(3,6) is currently occupied by the tail.\n\nBut in snake, moving to the tail cell is usually allowed because the tail will move away, but only if no food is eaten, so tail moves.\n\nBut if I move to a cell that has food, it's eaten, and tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case, (3,6) does not have food; it's the tail position.\n\nIf I move to (3,6), which is occupied by tail, but since the tail will move (if no food eaten), it should be ok, as long as after move, the tail moves, so it's free.\n\nStandard rule: moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves forward at the same time.\n\nBut in terms of collision, head moves to new cell, then if that cell is not food, tail is removed, so the cell is vacated.\n\nIf the cell has food, tail not removed.\n\nIn moving to (3,6) from (2,6):\n\nCurrent positions before this move (after turn 41): head at (2,6), body (2,5) to (3,6)\n\nNow turn 42, I move R to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is the tail position.\n\nSince I move to (3,6), and it does not have food (assuming no food there), then: head moves to (3,6), which was tail, but since no food, the tail is removed, so effectively, the snake moves, tail moves off.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,6), then body: (2,6), (2,5), ..., up to the segment before tail. The previous tail (3,6) is now head, so the segment that was before tail becomes new tail.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (2,6), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,4), ..., 12: (3,6)  let's count.\n\nAfter turn 41: positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ] 14 segments? No.\n\nTurn 41 start: before move, 13 segments.\n\nAfter moving U to (2,6) and eating: new head (2,6), previous positions all remain, so [ (2,6) ] + [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ] so 14 positions, tail at (3,6).\n\nNow turn 42: I move R to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is the current tail, and no food there (since food at (2,6) was eaten, and no other food there).\n\nSo, head moves to (3,6), and since no food eaten, the tail is removed. The tail is at (3,6), but head is moving to it, so after head moves to (3,6), the tail is removed, so the new positions are: head (3,6), then the body from index 1 to second last: that is, (2,6), (2,5), ..., up to (4,6), and the tail (3,6) is gone, so new tail is the previous segment before tail, which was (4,6)? Positions: after move, head at (3,6), then the first body segment is (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). So 13 segments again, tail at (4,6).\n\nAnd (3,6) was occupied but now head is there, and tail moved, so no collision.\n\nIf there was food at (3,6), it would be eaten, tail not move, but no food.\n\nSo moving to tail cell is safe if no food or if food, but with caution.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nBack to turn 41 choices.\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), I eat the food, but then from (2,6), I cannot move U (wall), cannot move D to (2,5) (body), so only L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6, which is within bounds, not wall, and not occupied by body currently? After turn 41, body has (2,6), (2,5), etc., (1,6) not occupied, so moving to (1,6) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is tail, which as above is ok.\n\nBut after eating at (2,6), the food is gone, so no food at (2,6) anymore.\n\nLife span is short, only 3 turns, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n\nBut I need to consider other options.\n\nWhat if I don't go U? I can go L or R.\n\nFirst, go L to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is within bounds, not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), etc., (1,5) not in list, so free.\n\nIf I move L to (1,5), no food there, so no eat, tail moves: head to (1,5), then body: (2,5), (2,4), ..., and tail (3,6) moves off? Since no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]\n\nAfter moving L to (1,5): new head (1,5), then body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), and tail (3,6) is removed? Since no food, the last segment is removed, so new positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ] tail at (4,6).\n\nLength 13.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move U, D, L, R, but head direction is L (since I moved L), so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L to (0,5) but x=0 wall, so cannot L, or R to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body, so collision.\n\nFrom (1,5), after moving L:\n\n- U to (1,6): possible, not occupied\n\n- D to (1,4): possible, not occupied\n\n- L to (0,5): x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R to (2,5): (2,5) is second segment, body, so if move there, collision.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R from current to (3,5).\n\nCurrent head (2,5), move R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is not occupied? Snake has (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc., (3,5) not in list, so free.\n\nNo food at (3,5), so no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), and tail (3,6) removed, so positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ] tail at (4,6).\n\nThen from (3,5), head direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is not in body anymore? After move, positions have (4,6) as tail, (3,6) is free? In the new positions, (3,6) is not there, so (3,6) is free.\n\nD to (3,4), or R to (4,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) to U (3,6): (3,6) is free now.\n\nD to (3,4): free? Not occupied.\n\nR to (4,5): free? Not occupied.\n\nL to (2,5): but (2,5) is second segment, body, collision.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\nNow, back to turn 41 choice.\n\nI need to think about the food and long-term.\n\nFood at (2,6) is very close and will disappear soon, in 3 turns. If I don't eat it now, I might not get another chance.\n\nBut if I eat it, I get +1, but then I'm at (2,6) with limited moves.\n\nFrom (2,6), after eating, I have to move L or R.\n\nSay I move L to (1,6).\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction L (since moved L).\n\nFrom (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (1,5); R to (2,6) but (2,6) is body now; L to (0,6) x=0 wall invalid.\n\nSo only D to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) may or may not be body, but after previous, if I moved to (1,6), from (2,6), moving L to (1,6).\n\nAfter turn 41: at (2,6) with body down to (3,6)\n\nTurn 42: move L to (1,6), no food at (1,6), so no eat, tail moves: head to (1,6), body: (2,6), (2,5), ..., and tail (3,6) removed, so positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6).\n\nThen from (1,6), only move D to (1,5), since U and L invalid, R to (2,6) body.\n\nSo move D to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) free? Not in positions, so ok.\n\nThen head at (1,5), and so on.\n\nBut I'm moving away from other food.\n\nIf from (2,6) I move R to (3,6), as before, it's safe.\n\nThen at (3,6), I can move, say, D to (3,5) or U, but U to (3,7) wall, invalid, so D to (3,5) or L to (2,6) body or R to (4,6) which may be body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) on turn 42, positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), etc., down to (4,6) or something.\n\nFrom above, after turn 42 move to (3,6) with no eat, positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) tail at (5,6).\n\nThen from (3,6), moves: U to (3,7) wall invalid; D to (3,5); L to (2,6) body; R to (4,6) which is body? (4,6) is in the body, yes, position before tail is (5,6), but (4,6) is in the list, yes, so R to (4,6) body, collision.\n\nOnly possible move D to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) may be free or not. In positions, after move, (3,5) not there, so free.\n\nSo move D to (3,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut the point is, if I go to (2,6) on turn 41, I eat the food, but then I'm stuck in the top row and have to move left or right, then down, and I might be cornered or something.\n\nThere are other foods at (1,2) and (3,2), which are bottom-left and bottom-middle.\n\n(1,2) and (3,2) are at y=2, which is near bottom.\n\ny=1 is bottom wall, but y=2 is ok.\n\nSnake body is mostly on the top and right, with tail around (3,6) to (6,6), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,2) or (3,2), I need to go down.\n\nCurrently at (2,5), if I don't go up, I can go left or right to start moving down.\n\nFor example, if I go L to (1,5), then I can go D to (1,4), then further down to (1,2) for food.\n\nSimilarly, if go R to (3,5), then down to (3,4), etc., to (3,2).\n\nFood at (1,2) and (3,2) have longer life span, 6 and 9 turns, so I have time.\n\nBut (2,6) is only available for 3 turns, including now.\n\nIf I miss it, it's gone.\n\nBut eating it might put me in a bad position.\n\nLet's think about the board state.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 (since walls at 0 and 7).\n\nObstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) blocked.\n\nSnake positions turn 41:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nBody: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nSo the snake is like: from (2,5) down to (2,3), right to (6,3), up to (6,6), left to (3,6).\n\nSo it's a sort of U-shape or something.\n\nEmpty cells: let's list free cells.\n\nAll cells not occupied by snake or walls or obstacle.\n\nWalls: borders and (3,1).\n\nSnake occupies: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nSo occupied: row y=3: (2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(6,3)\n\ny=4: (2,4), (6,4)\n\ny=5: (2,5), (6,5)\n\ny=6: (6,6),(5,6),(4,6),(3,6) and (2,6) is food, not occupied by snake.\n\nFood at (2,6), so (2,6) is free for movement, but has food.\n\nSimilarly, other free cells.\n\nFor example, (1,1) to (1,6) except where occupied.\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) obstacle, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — all free except (3,1) wall.\n\nBut snake not there.\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) — all free, no snake, and food at (1,2) and (3,2).\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3) occupied, (3,3) occ, etc, so (1,3) free\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4) occ, (3,4) free?

Since no eat, tail removed, so positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ] tail at (6,6)\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move U, D, L, R but head direction D (since moved D), so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nPossible: D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall invalid, R to (2,5) body, so only D to (1,4).\n\nThen continue down to (1,3), (1,2), etc.\n\nAt (1,2) there is food, which I can eat.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,6) I move R to (3,6), then down to (3,5), (3,4), etc to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) has food.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\nTurn 41: if I move U, eat (2,6), score +1.\n\nThen on subsequent turns, I can go down to eat other food.\n\nBut if I don't eat (2,6) now, it might disappear, and I lose the opportunity.\n\nSince life span 3, on turn 41,42,43 it is there.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 41, I can eat on 42 or 43.\n\nFor example, on turn 41, I move L to (1,5).\n\nThen head at (1,5), no eat, tail moves to (4,6)? As before.\n\nThen on turn 42, from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\n(1,6) has no food, but (2,6) has food.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), then at (1,6), then I can move R to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 41: move L to (1,5), no eat, positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n\nTurn 42: from (1,5), head direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L invalid, R to (2,5) body collision, so only U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), no food there, so head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) and tail (4,6) removed?

Positions have (3,3), but not (3,6), so (3,6) is free.\n\nCan move R to (3,6).\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut moving L to (1,6) is impossible because it's occupied.\n\nSo from (2,6) after late eating, I can only move R to (3,6) if possible.\n\nIn this case, (3,6) is free, so ok.\n\nBut I have fewer options.\n\nWhereas if I eat early, I might have more space.\n\nBut in both cases, after eating (2,6), I have to move to (3,6) or (1,6) if possible.\n\nNow for long-term, I have other food at (1,2) and (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is at bottom-left, (3,2) near bottom, but (3,1) is obstacle, so (3,2) is above the obstacle.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I can go from (1,5) down to (1,4), (1,3), (1,2).\n\nSimilarly for (3,2), from (3,5) down to (3,4), (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by snake, so I need to wait for it to move or go around.\n\nCurrent snake body has (3,3) occupied, so (3,2) is free, but to eat it, I need head at (3,2).\n\nSince the snake will move, the body might clear.\n\nFor example, if I start moving down, the tail will move, freeing up space.\n\nSimilarly for (1,2).\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nLet me consider the options for turn 41.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (2,6), eat food, score +1, length 14.\n\nThen from there, on turn 42, I can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay I move L to (1,6) on turn 42.\n\nNo food at (1,6), so no eat, tail moves.\n\nPositions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) tail (5,6) but after move, since no eat, tail removed, so positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]? Let's list: after move to (1,6), no eat, so head (1,6), then the previous body except tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions before turn 42 move: after turn 41, positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ] 14 segments.\n\nMove to (1,6), no food, so new head (1,6), then body: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) and tail (3,6) removed, so positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] 13 segments, tail at (5,6).\n\nThen turn 43, from (1,6), only move D to (1,5), as before.\n\nMove D to (1,5), no food, so head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) and tail (5,6) removed, positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ] tail at (6,6).\n\nThen turn 44, from (1,5), head direction D, so cannot U.\n\nMove D to (1,4), no food, etc.\n\nI can continue to (1,3), (1,2) to eat food at (1,2) on turn, say, 45 or so.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (1,4) on turn 44, then (1,3) on turn 45, then (1,2) on turn 46.\n\nFood at (1,2) life span 6, on turn 41 countdown 6, so available turns 41 to 46, so on turn 46, it is available if countdown >0.\n\nTurn 41: countdown=6, turn 42:5, turn 43:4, turn 44:3, turn 45:2, turn 46:1, turn 47:0 disappear.\n\nSo on turn 46, countdown=1, still there, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach (1,2) on turn 46.\n\nOn turn 45 at (1,3), move to (1,2) on turn 46 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,2).\n\nBut in this path, I ate (2,6) on 41, and (1,2) on 46.\n\nNow, option: on turn 41, move L to (1,5), not eat (2,6) yet.\n\nThen turn 41: move L to (1,5), no eat, positions as before: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n\nTurn 42: from (1,5), move U to (1,6), no food, so head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) and tail (4,6) removed, positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)\n\nTurn 43: move R to (2,6), eat food, head (2,6), body [ (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] and since eat, tail not move, so positions: [ (2,6) ] + body, so 14 segments, tail at (5,6)\n\nThen turn 44: from (2,6), can move L to (1,6) but (1,6) is body, collision; U wall; D to (2,5) body; R to (3,6) free? (3,6) not in positions, so move R to (3,6)\n\nNo food, so head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) and tail (5,6) removed? No eat, tail removed, so new positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) tail at (6,5)\n\nThen I can move down from there.\n\nBut I ate both foods, but the (2,6) was eaten later.\n\nIn terms of score, same, but position might be different.\n\nNow, to reach (1,2), in the first option, I can go directly from left side.\n\nSimilarly, I can consider going for (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) has longer life span.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (3,1), so to reach (3,2), I need to approach from above or sides.\n\nSince (3,3) is occupied, I need to move the snake to free it.\n\nFor example, if I move down from current position.\n\nOn turn 41, if I move R to (3,5).\n\nThen head at (3,5), no eat, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n\nThen turn 42, from (3,5), head direction R, so cannot L.\n\nMove D to (3,4), no food, or U to (3,6), or R to (4,5)\n\nSay move D to (3,4).\n\nThen head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) tail (4,6) removed, positions: [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)\n\nThen turn 43, move D to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\n(3,3) is in the body.\n\nMove L to (2,4) or R to (4,4), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), moves: U to (3,5) body; D to (3,3) body; L to (2,4) body; R to (4,4) free.\n\nSo only R to (4,4).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nTo reach (3,2), I need to clear the body at (3,3).\n\nSince the snake will move, if I move away, the tail will move, freeing (3,3).\n\nFor example, in the first option where I go left, the body at (3,3) will be freed when tail moves.\n\nIn general, by moving towards the bottom, I can free up space.\n\nBut let's think about risk.\n\nIf I eat (2,6) now, I'm at the top, and the body is below, so I have less room to manouver.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I can go down and eat other food, and maybe come back for (2,6) if possible, but it might disappear.\n\nSince I can eat it on turn 42 or 43 from (1,6) or other cells.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) then to (2,6) if possible.\n\nOn turn 41 move R to (3,5).\n\nTurn 42 move U to (3,6), if free.\n\nAfter turn 41 move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n\n(3,6) is not occupied, so move U to (3,6) on turn 42.\n\nNo food, so head (3,6), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) tail (4,6) removed, positions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)\n\nThen turn 43, from (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5) body, etc.\n\nMove L to (2,6), which has food, so eat it.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut in all cases, I can eat (2,6) by turn 43.\n\nNow for long-term survival, after eating (2,6), I need to navigate to other food without dying.\n\nThe area near (1,2) and (3,2) is more open, so perhaps it's better to go down first.\n\nAlso, there might be a risk at (2,6) because if I eat it and then move, I might be forced into a corner.\n\nBut in this grid, from (2,6), I can move to (1,6) or (3,6), then down.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can go to (1,5), (1,4), etc, to (1,2).\n\nSimilarly from (3,6) to (3,5), etc, but (3,3) is occupied, so I need to go around or wait.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), I can move to (3,5), but (3,5) might be free, then to (3,4), but (3,3) is body, so on turn after, I can go to (3,4), then to (4,4) or something, but (3,3) will be freed when tail moves.\n\nTo minimize risk, I should avoid the top row since it's cramped.\n\nMoreover, the food at (2,6) is only +1, same as others, and I have other opportunities.\n\nBut since it's there, not eating it means losing potential score.\n\nBut survival is priority.\n\nLet's see if there is any immediate danger.\n\nCurrently, no.\n\nAnother thing: the head is adjacent to tail? Head at (2,5), tail at (3,6), distance |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so not adjacent.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI think for turn 41, I should not go U to eat the food immediately, because it might limit my options. Instead, go left or right to start descending.\n\nBut which way?\n\nGo left to (1,5), then I can go down to (1,4), etc to (1,2).\n\nOr go right to (3,5), then down to (3,4), but (3,3) occupied, so I might go to (4,4) or something.\n\nLet's see the food at (3,2) and (1,2).\n\n(3,2) has life span 9, so plenty of time, (1,2) life span 6, also time.\n\nBut (1,2) is closer if I go left.\n\nFrom current (2,5), to (1,5) then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) in 4 moves, but on turn 41 move to (1,5), turn 42 to (1,4), turn 43 to (1,3), turn 44 to (1,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (3,5), turn 41, then to (3,4) turn 42, but on turn 42, from (3,5) move D to (3,4), then turn 43 to (3,3)? But (3,3) is body, not free, so I cannot move there directly.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (4,4) or (2,4) or (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, so only to (4,4) or (2,4) if free.\n\n(2,4) is body currently, but as snake moves, it might free.\n\nIn general, it might take longer to reach (3,2) because of the body.\n\nWhereas to (1,2), the path is clearer, only (1,3) to free, but it is free now.\n\n(1,3) is free, so from (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2).\n\nOn turn 42 at (1,4), turn 43 to (1,3), turn 44 to (1,2).\n\nAnd (1,2) food available until turn 46.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 44.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I can go for (3,2).\n\nBut (2,6) food will disappear on turn 44, so if I don't eat it by turn 43, I miss it.\n\nOn turn 43, if I am at (1,4) or something, I can't reach (2,6) in time.\n\nFor example, if I go for (1,2) path:\n\nTurn 41: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 42: move D to (1,4)  (from (1,5), head direction L, so can move D or U, but U to (1,6) not towards food, so move D to (1,4))\n\nThen turn 43: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 44: move D to (1,2) eat food.\n\nOn turn 43, I am at (1,3), and (2,6) is at top, I can't reach it in one move, so I miss eating (2,6).\n\nIf on turn 42 I go to (1,6) instead, then on turn 43 I can eat (2,6), as before.\n\nBut then I delay eating (1,2).\n\nLet's compare scores.\n\nIf I eat (2,6) on turn 41 or 43, I get +1 soon.\n\nIf I go directly for (1,2), I eat on turn 44, +1 later.\n\nBut both give +1, so no difference in score, but timing might affect survival.\n\nSince the grid might have more food later, but here only three foods given, all positive.\n\nFor long-term, after eating one food, I can go for the other.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat both if possible.\n\n(2,6) must be eaten by turn 43, (1,2) by turn 46, (3,2) by turn 49.\n\nI can eat (2,6) first, then (1,2), then (3,2).\n\nFor example, on turn 41 move U to (2,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 42 move L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 43 move D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 44 move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 45 move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 46 move D to (1,2) eat.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2), (3,2) to eat, but on turn 47, at (1,2), move to (2,2), then turn 48 to (3,2) eat.\n\nBut (3,2) available until turn 49, so ok.\n\nAnd I ate all three foods.\n\nBut is this safe?\n\nOn turn 41 to 46, as above.\n\nOn turn 46 at (1,2), eat, then head at (1,2), body grows.\n\nThen turn 47 move R to (2,2), no food? (2,2) may have no food, so move, tail moves.\n\nThen turn 48 move R to (3,2) eat.\n\nThen score +3.\n\nBut need to check if (2,2) is free, etc.\n\n(2,2) is free, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, if I start by going left without eating (2,6), I might miss it.\n\nFor example, turn 41 move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 42 move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 43 move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 44 move D to (1,2) eat\n\nThen I missed (2,6), so only +1 from (1,2), then I can go for (3,2), but missed one food.\n\nSo better to eat (2,6) as well.\n\nTherefore, for turn 41, I should move U to eat (2,6).\n\nThen from there, move L to (1,6) on turn 42, then D to (1,5) on turn 43, and so on down to (1,2).\n\nAfter eating (1,2), go to (3,2).\n\nBut after eating (1,2) on turn 46, at (1,2), then I need to go to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at x=3,y=2, so from (1,2), I can move R to (2,2) on turn 47, then R to (3,2) on turn 48 to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) first, but that might take longer.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 41: U (to (2,6), eat food)\n\nThen turn 42: L (to (1,6))\n\nTurn 43: D (to (1,5))  // since from (1,6), only D possible\n\nIn turn 43, from (1,6), after moving L on turn 42, head at (1,6), direction L, so on turn 43, moves: D to (1,5), or U invalid, L invalid, R to (2,6) body, so only D to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 44: from (1,5), head direction D (since moved D), so can move D to (1,4) or U to (1,6) body, L invalid, R to (2,5) body, so only D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 45: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)  // similarly, only D possible if no other options, but (1,3) free\n\nFrom (1,4), head direction D, so can move D to (1,3), or L invalid, R to (2,4) which may be free, but to go to food, better go D.\n\nTurn 46: from (1,3), move D to (1,2) eat\n\nThen turn 47: from (1,2), head direction D, so can move U to (1,3) body? After eating, positions: on turn 46 move to (1,2) eat, so head (1,2), body previous: after turn 45, positions depend.\n\nLet's track positions to be safe.\n\nAfter turn 45: let's start from turn 41.\n\nTurn 41: move U to (2,6), eat, positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]\n\nTurn 42: move L to (1,6), no food, so head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) and tail (4,6) removed, so positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)\n\nTurn 43: move D to (1,5), no food, so head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) and tail (5,6) removed, positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ] tail at (6,6)\n\nTurn 44: move D to (1,4), no food, head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) and tail (6,6) removed, positions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) ] tail at (6,5)\n\nTurn 45: move D to (1,3), no food, head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) and tail (6,5) removed, positions: [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4)\n\nTurn 46: move D to (1,2), eat food, so head (1,2), and since eat, tail not move, positions: [ (1,2) ] + [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) ] 14 segments, tail at (6,4)\n\nThen turn 47: from (1,2), head direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: D to (1,1) but y=1, not wall? y=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 is playable, but (1,1) is free, and not wall.\n\ny=0 wall, so y=1 to 6 playable.\n\n(1,1) free, no food.\n\nL to (0,1) x=0 wall invalid.\n\nR to (2,2) free.\n\nSo can move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1).\n\nTo go to (3,2), better move R to (2,2).\n\nMove R to (2,2), no food, so head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), etc., tail moves?

Positions: indices, tail is (6,4), removed, so body from index 1 to 13 except tail is removed? New positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\nThen turn 48: move R to (3,2)? (3,2) is food, but move to (3,2) from (2,2).\n\nHead direction R (since moved R), so can move R to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, so eat it.\n\nThen score another +1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer should be from turn 41 onwards.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, I can output for turns 41 to 45 or so.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 41, I decided U.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nThen for turn 42, I need to specify.\n\nIn the plan, turn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: D\n\netc.\n\nBut I should confirm if this is optimal.\n\nAnother option: after eating (2,6) on turn 41, move R to (3,6) on turn 42.\n\nThen from (3,6), move D to (3,5) on turn 43, then to (3,4) on turn 44, but (3,4) free, then to (3,3)?

The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate action (turn 41)**: The food at (2,6) has a short life span (3 turns, disappearing after turn 43) and is directly accessible by moving up. Eating it now secures +1 score and increases snake length to 14, with minimal immediate risk.\n- **Subsequent moves**: After eating (2,6), moving left to (1,6) on turn 42 avoids the body and walls, then descending down the left column (turns 43-46) to reach the food at (1,2) by turn 46. This path is safe and efficient, leveraging the open left side of the grid to avoid body collisions and capitalize on the food at (1,2) (life span 6, available until turn 46).\n- **Long-term**: This sequence eats two foods (+2 score) by turn 46 and positions the snake to potentially eat (3,2) later (life span 9, available until turn 49). The moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions, with no instant reversals.\n- **Risk avoidance**: Moving up on turn 41 is safe as (2,6) is not under the tail and no Tail Reward Danger applies. Descending left minimizes entrapment risks compared to other paths.\n\n**Planned Moves (Turns 41-46)**:\n- **Turn 41**: Move U (up) to (2,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length 14). Head direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 42**: Move L (left) to (1,6). No food here, so no growth. Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 43**: Move D (down) to (1,5). No food here, so no growth. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 44**: Move D (down) to (1,4). No food here, so no growth. Head direction remains D.\n- **Turn 45**: Move D (down) to (1,3). No food here, so no growth. Head direction remains D.\n- **Turn 46**: Move D (down) to (1,2) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length 15). Head direction remains D.\n\n**Why this sequence?**  \n- **Turn 41 (U)**: Eats (2,6) immediately to capture the time-sensitive reward before it disappears.  \n- **Turn 42 (L)**: Avoids moving down (into body) or right (into a less open area), steering toward the left column for safer descent.  \n- **Turns 43-46 (D)**: Descends efficiently to (1,2), eating it on turn 46 just before it disappears. This path is collision-free and maximizes score by securing two foods quickly.  \n- **5+ turns ahead**: By turn 46, the snake has eaten two foods and is positioned to navigate toward (3,2) for another +1, with a clear path (e.g., move right to (2,2) on turn 47, then to (3,2) on turn 48).  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- No wall or obstacle collisions: All moves stay within x=1-6, y=1-6, avoiding (3,1).  \n- No body collisions: The sequence avoids the snake's body at all steps (e.g., on turn 41, (2,6) is free; on turn 42, (1,6) is free; etc.).  \n- No instant reversals: E.g., from U on turn 41, L on turn 42 is not opposite; from D on turn 43, D on turn 44 is not opposite.  \n- Tail Reward Danger: Not triggered, as no food is on the tail cell when the head is adjacent.  \n\nThis plan scores +2 by turn 46 with minimal risk, prioritizing survival by keeping the snake in open areas and setting up for future food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: L \\\\\nTurn 43: D \\\\\nTurn 44: D \\\\\nTurn 45: D \\\\\nTurn 46: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe grid has walls. From the state, border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (2,6), and it's moving Up. The body segments are listed: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. So the tail is at (3,6).\n\nFood items:\n\n- One at (1,2) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- Another at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nCurrent turn is 42.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns, but the answer format says to output actions starting from turn 42 onwards, probably for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead,\" I should plan at least 5 moves, but I need to output the actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. I think I need to provide a sequence, but it might be open-ended. I should simulate a few moves ahead to decide the best immediate action.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see:\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo possible positions: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). That's 14 segments.\n\nLet me plot this:\n\n- Row y=6: (2,6) head, then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — (3,6) is the tail.\n\nPositions: index 0: (2,6) head, index 1: (2,5), index 2: (2,4), index 3: (2,3), index 4: (3,3), index 5: (4,3), index 6: (5,3), index 7: (6,3), index 8: (6,4), index 9: (6,5), index 10: (6,6), index 11: (5,6), index 12: (4,6), index 13: (3,6) tail.\n\nSo on y=6: from x=2 to x=6, but not all, (2,6) head, (6,6) is index 10, (5,6) index 11, (4,6) index 12, (3,6) index 13.\n\nAlso, on y=5: (2,5) index 1, (6,5) index 9\n\ny=4: (2,4) index 2, (6,4) index 8\n\ny=3: (2,3) index 3, (3,3) index 4, (4,3) index 5, (5,3) index 6, (6,3) index 7\n\nAnd internal obstacle at (3,1), but y=1 is not occupied by snake except possibly, y=3 has positions, but (3,1) is obstacle.\n\nNow food: (1,2) and (3,2), both at y=2.\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2, (3,2) at x=3,y=2.\n\nHead is at (2,6), moving Up. But Up means increasing y, since U is (x,y+1). In coordinates, typically (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? I need to know the orientation.\n\nThe movement: U (x,y+1) so y increases up, I assume, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo head at (2,6), which is near the top, since y=7 is wall.\n\nMoving Up: U is (x,y+1), so from (2,6), moving Up would go to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so that's invalid. Can't move Up because it would hit the wall.\n\nSnake head direction is U, but at (2,6), moving U to (2,7) is impossible since y=7 wall.\n\nBut the snake is at (2,6) with direction U, meaning it just moved there or is facing up? The head direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: U\", which I think is the current facing direction.\n\nBut in terms of movement, I can choose to move in a different direction, except I can't instantly reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) on the next turn, because that would be reverse.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo current direction is U, so I cannot move D on turn 42.\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- U: to (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- D: to (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied by the body, specifically index 1: (2,5), which is a body segment.\n\nCan I move to a body segment? Only if it's the tail, and even then, it might be risky.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is safe because when the head moves there, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nBut in this case, (2,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,6). (2,5) is the second segment, so moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, L: to (1,6) — is that valid? x=1,y=6, borders are walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not wall, y=6 not wall. Also, no internal obstacle. But is (1,6) occupied? Snake positions: (2,6), (2,5), etc., (1,6) is not listed, so empty? Let's see all positions: from (2,6) to (3,6), no (1,6), so (1,6) should be free.\n\nR: to (3,6) — (3,6) is the tail, index 13. Since it's the tail, moving to (3,6) should be safe because the tail will move away.\n\nD: to (2,5) is body, not tail, so collision.\n\nU: to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,6) with current direction U:\n\n- L: to (1,6) — empty, I think.\n\n- R: to (3,6) — tail, so safe.\n\n- D: not possible, body collision.\n\n- U: not possible, wall.\n\nAlso, cannot move D because it's reverse? Current direction is U, so moving D would be opposite, so not allowed on next turn.\n\nThe rule is: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo for turn 42, since current direction is U, I cannot choose D as the action.\n\nBut in this case, D is already invalid because of body, so only L and R are possible.\n\nL to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, (1,6) is empty, and (3,6) is tail.\n\nBut (3,6) is the tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n\nFood at (1,2) and (3,2), both positive, life span 5 and 8 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 42, so (1,2) disappears after 5 turns, i.e., on turn 47 it will be gone if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (1,2), life span 5 at turn 42, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning on turn 47 it will be gone. Turn 42: life span 5, after turn 42, it becomes 4, then 3,2,1, and after turn 46, it becomes 0 and disappears, so not present on turn 47. Similarly for (3,2) with life span 8, disappears after 8 turns, on turn 50.\n\nBut I need to eat it before it disappears.\n\nNow, head at (2,6), food at (1,2) and (3,2), which are both at y=2, far below.\n\ny=2 is down, since y=6 is high, y=0 bottom.\n\nSo from (2,6) to (1,2) or (3,2) is several moves away.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 14 segments.\n\nI need to plan a path to get to the food without dying.\n\nFirst, for immediate move, turn 42: I can go L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I go R to (3,6), which is the tail. After moving, the head is at (3,6), and since I ate nothing, length unchanged, tail moves away. The tail was at (3,6), but when head moves to (3,6), the tail moves to the next position. Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,6), then body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nIf I move R to (3,6):\n\n- New head position: (3,6)\n\n- Since no food eaten, tail moves away. The tail is the last segment, so the new tail will be the previous second last, which is (4,6)? Positions: after head moves, the body shifts.\n\nStandard snake movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSo after moving head to (3,6), the segment that was at (2,6) is now head at (3,6), then the segment that was at (2,5) moves to (2,6), (2,4) to (2,5), ..., up to (3,6) was tail, but (3,6) is now head, so the segment that was at (4,6) moves to where? Let's list the positions before move:\n\nIndex: 0: (2,6) head\n\n1: (2,5)\n\n2: (2,4)\n\n3: (2,3)\n\n4: (3,3)\n\n5: (4,3)\n\n6: (5,3)\n\n7: (6,3)\n\n8: (6,4)\n\n9: (6,5)\n\n10: (6,6)\n\n11: (5,6)\n\n12: (4,6)\n\n13: (3,6) tail\n\nAfter move R to (3,6):\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nThen body: the segment that was index 0 moves to new head, so index 0 new: (3,6)\n\nThen index 1 moves to where index 0 was, (2,6)\n\nIndex 2 moves to where index 1 was, (2,5)\n\n...\n\nUp to index 13 was at (3,6), but (3,6) is now head, so the tail segment is removed? Since no food eaten, length same, so tail is removed.\n\nAfter head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,6)\n\nThen body segments: the previous positions from index 0 to 12, but shifted.\n\nSpecifically: the new body starts from previous index 0 position: (2,6) becomes the new neck? Let's think:\n\n- New head at (3,6)\n\n- New position 1: previous head position (2,6)\n\n- New position 2: previous position 1 (2,5)\n\n- New position 3: previous position 2 (2,4)\n\n- New position 4: previous position 3 (2,3)\n\n- New position 5: previous position 4 (3,3)\n\n- New position 6: previous position 5 (4,3)\n\n- New position 7: previous position 6 (5,3)\n\n- New position 8: previous position 7 (6,3)\n\n- New position 9: previous position 8 (6,4)\n\n- New position 10: previous position 9 (6,5)\n\n- New position 11: previous position 10 (6,6)\n\n- New position 12: previous position 11 (5,6)\n\n- New position 13: previous position 12 (4,6)  // this is the new tail, since tail was index 13, but not included.\n\nPrevious tail was index 13 at (3,6), which is now head, so it's gone. New tail is the segment that was at index 12: (4,6)\n\nSo new snake: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] so tail at (4,6)\n\nHead at (3,6), direction after moving R, so new head direction is R.\n\nIf I move L to (1,6):\n\nNew head at (1,6)\n\nThen body: previous (2,6) becomes position 1, (2,5) position 2, ..., up to previous index 12 (4,6) position 13, and tail (3,6) is removed, so new tail at (4,6) or what?\n\nPrevious positions: after head move to (1,6)\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nNew position 1: (2,6)\n\nNew position 2: (2,5)\n\n...\n\nNew position 13: previous index 12 (4,6)  // since previous index 13 (3,6) is not included, new tail at (4,6)\n\nBody segments: from previous index 0 to 12 except head is new.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nHead direction now L.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go R to (3,6), it's safe, but (3,6) was tail, now head there, and the area around.\n\nIf I go L to (1,6), also safe, empty cell.\n\nBut I need to get to the food at (1,2) or (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is at bottom-left, (3,2) is at x=3,y=2.\n\nNow, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is wall, can't go there.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the right and bottom.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid:\n\ny=7: wall\n\ny=6: cells (1,6), (2,6) head, (3,6) tail, (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) — (6,6) is occupied, (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) all occupied.\n\nFrom positions: at y=6: (2,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) so x=1,6 is free, x=2,3,4,5,6 occupied except x=1 free.\n\nx=1,y=6 is free, x=2,y=6 head, x=3,y=6 tail, x=4,5,6 occupied.\n\ny=5: (2,5) and (6,5) occupied, so (1,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) free? Positions: (2,5) and (6,5) occupied, so others free.\n\ny=4: (2,4) and (6,4) occupied, others free.\n\ny=3: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) occupied, so (1,3) free, and (3,3) to (6,3) occupied.\n\ny=2: food at (1,2) and (3,2), and no snake, I think. Snake positions: y=3 has (2,3) etc., y=2 not occupied.\n\ny=1: wall at bottom, but internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) wall, other cells at y=1 might be free but y=1 is above y=0 wall? y=0 is wall, y=1 is the first row, but (3,1) is obstacle, so cells at y=1: x=1,2,4,5,6 should be free, but since y=0 wall, y=1 is playable except obstacles.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nTo reach (1,2) or (3,2), from head at (2,6).\n\nIf I go left to (1,6), then I can go down from there.\n\nIf I go right to (3,6), I might go down or left.\n\nBut (3,6) is now head if I go right.\n\nBut let's think about the food life span.\n\n(1,2) has life span 5, so it will disappear on turn 47 if not eaten. Turn 42: life span 5, after turn 42: 4, turn 43:3, turn 44:2, turn 45:1, turn 46:0 and disappears, so not available on turn 46 or after? On turn 46, life span 0, so gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 8, turn 42:8, turn 43:7, ..., turn 49:1, turn 50:0 gone.\n\nTo eat (1,2), I need to reach it by turn 45 at the latest, since on turn 46 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2) by turn 49.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (1,2): delta x=1-2=-1, delta y=2-6=-4, so Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| =1+4=5, so at least 5 moves if direct path.\n\nBut there might be obstacles or body in the way.\n\nSimilarly to (3,2): dx=3-2=1, dy=2-6=-4, distance 1+4=5.\n\nSo both are 5 moves away in theory.\n\nBut from (2,6), if I go L to (1,6), then to (1,2) is down, but I need to go to y=2.\n\nFrom (1,6) to (1,2) is directly down, but I need to check if cells are free.\n\nPath: (1,6) to (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2).\n\nNow, are these cells free?\n\n(1,5): from earlier, y=5, (2,5) and (6,5) occupied, so (1,5) should be free.\n\n(1,4): y=4, (2,4) and (6,4) occupied, so (1,4) free.\n\n(1,3): y=3, (2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(6,3) occupied, so (1,3) free.\n\n(1,2): food, free except for food.\n\nBut (1,2) has food, so I can eat it when I move there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,2) from (2,6) via R then down.\n\nBut let's see the situation.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nIf head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (3,6), no food there, so not an issue now.\n\nFood is at (1,2) and (3,2), far away.\n\nSo for turn 42, I need to choose between L and R.\n\nIf I go L to (1,6), I can then go D to (1,5), etc., down to (1,2) in 4 more moves: from (1,6) to (1,5) turn 43, (1,4) turn 44, (1,3) turn 45, (1,2) turn 46. But on turn 46, food at (1,2) has life span 0? Turn 42: life span 5, after move, turn 43, it decreases to 4, so on turn 46, after move, life span should be 2? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 42, food life span is 5.\n\nAfter each turn, including when the snake moves, the life span decreases.\n\nSo when I move on turn 42, after the move, life span decreases for all food.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nSo for food at (1,2), life span 5 at turn 42 (before any action).\n\nAfter turn 42 action, life span becomes 4.\n\nAfter turn 43, becomes 3.\n\nAfter turn 44, becomes 2.\n\nAfter turn 45, becomes 1.\n\nAfter turn 46, becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo to eat it, I need to be on (1,2) on turn 45 or earlier? When I move to a food cell, I eat it during the move.\n\nOn turn t, when I move to a cell with food, I eat it, and then life span decreases after the move? Or before?\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nBut when I eat, it's during the move.\n\nI think: at the start of turn, before action, food has certain life span.\n\nThen I choose action, move to cell.\n\nIf the cell has food, I eat it, get reward, and length increases.\n\nThen, after the move, for all food, life span decreases by 1. If life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if not eaten.\n\nFor example, to eat (1,2), I need to move to (1,2) when its life span >0.\n\nAt turn 42, life span 5, if I could move to it now, I can eat, but I'm at (2,6), far.\n\nEarliest I can be at (1,2) is turn, say, 46 or 47, depending on path.\n\nFrom turn 42:\n\nTurn 42: move from (2,6) to, say, (1,6) or (3,6)\n\nSuppose I go to (1,6) on turn 42.\n\nThen turn 43: from (1,6) I can go D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 44: D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 45: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 46: D to (1,2)\n\nOn turn 46, when I move to (1,2), the food is still there if life span >0 before move.\n\nAt turn 46 start, life span of (1,2) would be: turn 42 start:5, after turn 42:4, after turn 43:3, after turn 44:2, after turn 45:1, so at turn 46 start, life span=1.\n\nThen I move to (1,2), eat it, since life span >0.\n\nThen after move, life span decreases to 0, but I already ate it, so it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I arrive on turn 45: at turn 45 start, life span=2 (after turn 44 decrease), I move to (1,2), eat, then after move life span dec to 1, but since eaten, it's removed.\n\nLife span decreases after the turn, so when I move to a cell, if food is present at the start of turn, I can eat it.\n\nAt start of turn, food with life span >0 is present.\n\nI move to it, eat it.\n\nThen after move, life span decreases, but for that food, since eaten, it's gone.\n\nFor other food, life span decreases.\n\nSo for (1,2), at turn 46 start, life span=1, present, I can eat it if I move there.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 45 start, life span=2, I can eat.\n\nBut turn 45 is earlier.\n\nWith the path above, I arrive on turn 46.\n\nCan I arrive earlier?\n\nFrom (2,6) turn 42, if I go directly down, but I can't, because (2,5) is body, and D is reverse? Current direction U, so I cannot move D on turn 42.\n\nOnly L or R.\n\nSo I must go L or R first.\n\nIf I go L to (1,6) on turn 42, then D on turn 43 to (1,5), D turn 44 to (1,4), D turn 45 to (1,3), D turn 46 to (1,2), eat on turn 46.\n\nIf I go R to (3,6) on turn 42, then I need to go down or left to reach (3,2) or (1,2).\n\n(3,2) is closer in x, but same y distance.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go D to (3,5), but (3,5) free? y=5, positions: (2,5) and (6,5) occupied, so (3,5) free? x=3,y=5.\n\ny=5 cells: (1,5) free, (2,5) occupied, (3,5) free, (4,5) free, (5,5) free, (6,5) occupied.\n\nSo (3,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) should be free, y=4: (2,4) and (6,4) occupied, so (3,4) free.\n\n(3,3) is occupied by snake, index 4: (3,3)\n\n(3,2) is food.\n\nBut to go from (3,6) to (3,2), I need to go down, but (3,3) is occupied, so I cannot go directly to (3,3) from (3,6) because (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) but (3,3) is body.\n\nFrom (3,6), turn 42 move to (3,6), new head at (3,6), direction R.\n\nThen turn 43: from (3,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut U to (3,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) — (3,5) free, as above.\n\nL to (2,6) — but (2,6) is now body? After move, positions: head at (3,6), body at (2,6), (2,5), etc., so (2,6) is occupied by body.\n\nR to (4,6) — (4,6) is body, occupied.\n\nCurrent direction after move is R, so I cannot move L (opposite) on next turn.\n\nFrom (3,6), new head direction is R, since I moved R to there.\n\nSo for turn 43, current direction R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (3,5) free, valid\n\n- L: (2,6) body, and also opposite direction? Current direction R, L is opposite, so cannot move L.\n\n- R: (4,6) body, occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (3,5).\n\nSo turn 43: D to (3,5)\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 44: from (3,5), can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (3,6) — but (3,6) was head, now body? After previous move, positions: after turn 43, head to (3,5), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), etc.\n\nSo (3,6) is occupied by body.\n\nD to (3,4) — (3,4) free? y=4, (2,4) occupied, (6,4) occupied, (3,4) should be free.\n\nL to (2,5) — (2,5) occupied by body.\n\nR to (4,5) — (4,5) free? y=5, (4,5) free.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) body, invalid\n\n- D: (3,4) free, valid\n\n- L: (2,5) body, invalid\n\n- R: (4,5) free, valid\n\nAlso, cannot move U because opposite to current D.\n\nSo can go D or R.\n\nTo reach (3,2), I should go D to (3,4).\n\nTurn 44: D to (3,4)\n\nHead at (3,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 45: from (3,4), move to (3,3)? (3,3) is occupied by body.\n\nAfter turn 44, positions: head to (3,4), body: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), etc., so (3,3) is still body? Let's not get into details.\n\n(3,3) is a body segment, so I cannot move to (3,3) directly.\n\nMove to (3,3) would cause collision.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go L, R, or D, but D to (3,3) body, invalid.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4):\n\nU to (3,5) — (3,5) is body, invalid\n\nD to (3,3) — body, invalid\n\nL to (2,4) — (2,4) is body, invalid\n\nR to (4,4) — (4,4) free? y=4, (2,4) occupied, (6,4) occupied, (4,4) should be free.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,4).\n\nTurn 45: R to (4,4)\n\nNow head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nThen to reach (3,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), and there's obstacle at (3,1), but not blocking directly.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go L to (3,4), but (3,4) is now body? After move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), etc., so (3,4) occupied.\n\nU to (4,5) — (4,5) free? y=5, (4,5) free.\n\nD to (4,3) — (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (5,4) — free? y=4, (5,4) free? No snake at y=4 except (2,4) and (6,4), so (5,4) free.\n\nCurrent direction R, cannot move L.\n\nSo possible: U, D, R, but D to (4,3) body, invalid, so U to (4,5) or R to (5,4).\n\nNot getting closer to (3,2).\n\nThis is taking too long; I might not reach (3,2) in time or at all directly.\n\nSimilarly for (1,2), if I go left first, I can reach it by turn 46.\n\nBut let's confirm the path to (1,2) from left move.\n\nTurn 42: L to (1,6)\n\nHead at (1,6), direction L.\n\nTurn 43: from (1,6), can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (1,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) free, valid.\n\nL to (0,6) wall, invalid. x=0 wall.\n\nR to (2,6) body, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction L, cannot move R (opposite).\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,5).\n\nTurn 43: D to (1,5)\n\nHead at (1,5), direction D.\n\nTurn 44: from (1,5), move D to (1,4) free, or other?\n\nU to (1,6) body, invalid? After move to (1,5), body includes (1,6), so (1,6) occupied.\n\nD to (1,4) free.\n\nL to (0,5) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,5) body, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction D, cannot move U.\n\nSo only D to (1,4).\n\nTurn 44: D to (1,4)\n\nHead at (1,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 45: from (1,4), U to (1,5) body, invalid; D to (1,3) free; L to (0,4) wall; R to (2,4) body, invalid. Only D to (1,3).\n\nTurn 45: D to (1,3)\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 46: from (1,3), U to (1,4) body, invalid; D to (1,2) free and food; L to (0,3) wall; R to (2,3) body, invalid. Only D to (1,2), eat food.\n\nSo I eat on turn 46, with life span 1 at start, so safe.\n\nNow, if I go right first to (3,6) on turn 42, I might not reach either food easily, as above.\n\nBut there is another food at (3,2) with life span 8, so I can reach it later.\n\nBut (1,2) has shorter life, so I should prioritize eating it before it disappears.\n\n(3,2) has longer life, so I can get it after.\n\nBut when I eat (1,2), my snake grows, so I need to be careful with space.\n\nBut since I'm going to the left side, it might be open.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I will have length 15, and head at (1,2).\n\nThen I can consider going to (3,2) or other.\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), and there's obstacle at (3,1), so I need to approach from above or sides.\n\nBut let's think about the immediate choice.\n\nFor turn 42, if I go left, I can eat (1,2) on turn 46.\n\nIf I go right, I might not eat any food soon, and (1,2) might disappear before I can reach it.\n\nWith the path above, if I go right, I ended up at (4,4) by turn 45, not close to (1,2) or (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,6) turn 42 R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 43 D to (3,5)\n\nThen from (3,5) turn 44, I could go R to (4,5) instead of D, but (4,5) is free.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go down, etc., but to (3,2), it's messy.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) turn 44, head at (4,5), direction? After moving from (3,5) to (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 45: can go U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (4,6) body, invalid? After move, positions: head to (4,5), body (3,5), (3,6), etc., so (4,6) is body? Let's not.\n\n(4,6) is occupied by body, as per initial, but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut roughly, (4,6) might be body.\n\nD to (4,4) free.\n\nL to (3,5) body, invalid.\n\nR to (5,5) free? y=5, (5,5) free.\n\nCurrent direction R, cannot move L.\n\nSo can go D or R or U, but U to (4,6) body, invalid, so D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n\nThen from there, to reach (3,2) is farther.\n\nWhereas from left path, I can eat on turn 46.\n\nMoreover, with life span, (1,2) must be eaten by turn 45 or 46.\n\nTurn 45: at turn 45 start, life span=2, if I can be at (1,2) on turn 45.\n\nBut from head at (2,6) turn 42, to (1,2) in 3 moves? Impossible, min distance 5.\n\nTurn 42 to 45 is 3 moves later, but I start from (2,6) after turn 42 move.\n\nAfter turn 42 move, head at new position.\n\nFor example, if turn 42 move to (1,6), then after turn 42, head at (1,6).\n\nThen turn 43 to (1,5), turn 44 to (1,4), turn 45 to (1,3), not (1,2) yet.\n\nTo reach (1,2) on turn 45, I need to be at (1,3) on turn 44 or something.\n\nFrom (2,6) turn 42, after move to (1,6), then on turn 43 to (1,5), turn 44 to (1,4), turn 45 to (1,3), turn 46 to (1,2).\n\nSo on turn 45, I'm at (1,3), not (1,2).\n\n(1,2) can be eaten on turn 46 at earliest with this path.\n\nSimilarly, no faster way.\n\nIf I could go down immediately, but I can't because of body and direction constraint.\n\nAnother option: from (2,6) turn 42, go L to (1,6), then as above.\n\nOr, is there a way to go down faster?\n\nFor example, after going to (1,6), on turn 43, I go D to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut I have to go step by step.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving in a way to clear the body faster, but it's slow.\n\nNow, for the other food at (3,2), with life span 8, I have until turn 49 to eat it.\n\nBut if I eat (1,2) first, I can then go to (3,2).\n\nFrom (1,2) after eating on turn 46, head at (1,2), direction D (since I came from above).\n\nThen I can move to (2,2) or (1,1), but y=1 is not wall, except (3,1) obstacle.\n\n(1,1) is playable? y=1, x=1, not wall, not obstacle except (3,1), so (1,1) free.\n\nBut (1,1) is adjacent to wall? y=0 wall, but y=1 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) might be free.\n\nBut (3,2) has food.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go R to (2,2), then down or right to (3,2).\n\n(2,2) should be free, no snake there.\n\nThen to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is food, I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I can go directly if possible.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 42, going left seems better to get the food with short life.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) is at (3,2), and the body is near, but not adjacent.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but tail is not near food.\n\nNow, if I go right to (3,6), I might be able to reach (3,2) but with difficulty because of the body at (3,3).\n\nThe body at (3,3) might move away as the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,6) on turn 42, then to (3,5) on turn 43, then on turn 44, from (3,5) I can go to (3,4) if free, but (3,4) is free, turn 44 D to (3,4), then on turn 45, from (3,4) I can go to (3,3)? But (3,3) is body.\n\nBut depending on how the body moves.\n\nLet's simulate the body positions if I go right.\n\nTurn 42: move R to (3,6), head at (3,6), body: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail. (3,3) is still there.\n\nTurn 43: move D to (3,5), head at (3,5), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) tail. (3,3) still body.\n\nTurn 44: move D to (3,4), head at (3,4), body: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) tail. (3,3) still body.\n\nNow turn 45: from (3,4), I want to go to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by body, so invalid.\n\nI can go to (4,4) or other.\n\nBut (3,3) is still occupied until the tail moves.\n\nThe tail is moving, but slowly.\n\nFor example, on turn 45, if I could wait, but I have to move.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go L to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, invalid.\n\nOr R to (4,4), free.\n\nOr U to (3,5) body, invalid.\n\nD to (3,3) body, invalid.\n\nSo must go R to (4,4).\n\nThen head at (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, (3,3) will eventually move, but it might take time.\n\nThe segment at (3,3) will be shifted.\n\nFor example, after turn 44, positions as above.\n\nOn turn 45, if I move head somewhere, say to (4,4), then body shifts: new head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) tail. (3,3) still there.\n\nThen on turn 46, from (4,4), I can go to (4,3) or other.\n\n(4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nGo to (3,4) but (3,4) is body now.\n\nNot easy to reach (3,2).\n\nWhereas if I go left, I eat (1,2) on turn 46, and the left side is open.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I grow, so the tail doesn't move, but in this case, since I eat, the length increases.\n\nIn the left path, on turn 46 I move to (1,2) and eat, so new head at (1,2), and the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (1,2), then previous positions from (1,3) to (1,6), (2,6), etc., with the tail still at (4,6) or wherever.\n\nAfter eating, the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nBut in this case, it should be fine.\n\nNow, for the food at (3,2), after I eat (1,2), I can go to it.\n\nBut (3,2) has life span 8 at turn 42, so on turn 46, after 4 turns, life span 8-4=4? Turn 42 start:8, after turn 42:7, turn 43:6, turn 44:5, turn 45:4, turn 46:3, so on turn 46 start, life span 3, plenty of time.\n\nFrom (1,2) on turn 46, I can go to (2,2), then (3,2), for example.\n\n(2,2) should be free, (3,2) food.\n\nIf I go directly.\n\nTurn 46: head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (1,3) body, invalid (since after eating, body includes (1,3), (1,4), etc.)\n\nD to (1,1) — (1,1) free, I assume.\n\nL to (0,2) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,2) free.\n\nCurrent direction D, cannot move U.\n\nSo can go D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nTo reach (3,2), I should go R to (2,2).\n\nTurn 46: R to (2,2) — but after eating on turn 46, let's not confuse.\n\nOn turn 46, I move to (1,2) and eat, so head now at (1,2), direction from previous, which was D to (1,2).\n\nThen for the next move, turn 47: from (1,2), current direction D.\n\nCan move: U to (1,3) body, invalid; D to (1,1) free; L to (0,2) wall; R to (2,2) free.\n\nCannot move U because opposite to D? Current direction D, U is opposite, so cannot move U.\n\nSo can move D or R.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction R.\n\nThen turn 48: from (2,2), move to (3,2) if possible.\n\n(3,2) is food, and should be free except food.\n\nIs there body? Not near, so yes.\n\nMove R to (3,2), eat.\n\nSo I can eat (3,2) on turn 48.\n\nLife span at turn 48 start: after turn 46 decrease to 3? Turn 46 start: for (3,2), turn 42 start:8, after turn 42:7, ..., after turn 45:4, after turn 46:3, after turn 47:2, so turn 48 start:2, eat on turn 48.\n\nGood.\n\nIf I had gone right first, I might not eat (1,2) at all, and it disappears.\n\nSo for turn 42, going left is better.\n\nBut is there a reason to go right?\n\nPerhaps to avoid potential dead ends or something.\n\nThe left side seems open.\n\nAfter eating both foods, I need to survive, but that's later.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but it doesn't block the path to (3,2) from above.\n\n(3,2) can be accessed from (3,3) or (2,2) or (4,2), but (3,3) might be occupied.\n\nBut with the body moving, it might free up.\n\nIn the short term, going left allows me to eat the time-sensitive food.\n\nMoreover, by going left, I'm moving away from the dense body area.\n\nThe body is mostly on the right and bottom, so left is freer.\n\nTherefore, for turn 42, I should move L to (1,6).\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nThe format is to start from turn 42 action, then turn 43, etc., but how many turns? I think I should provide the immediate action and perhaps a few more, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to plan ahead but output the actions.\n\nThe answer format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\n\nProbably for several turns, but it might be up to me.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can output for the next few turns.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 43: move D to (1,5)  // as per above, only choice\n\nTurn 44: move D to (1,4)  // only choice\n\nTurn 45: move D to (1,3)  // only choice\n\nTurn 46: move D to (1,2) and eat\n\nThen after that, as above, turn 47: from (1,2) move R to (2,2)  // since cannot go U, and D or R, R to go to food\n\nIn turn 47, from (1,2) after eating on turn 46, head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 47: possible moves D to (1,1) or R to (2,2), cannot go U or L.\n\nI choose R to (2,2) to approach (3,2).\n\nThen turn 48: from (2,2), move R to (3,2) and eat, if possible.\n\nFrom (2,2), after moving to (2,2) on turn 47, head at (2,2), direction R (since moved R).\n\nThen turn 48: can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (2,3) — (2,3) might be body? After previous moves, it might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 46: head at (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — length 15 after eating (1,2).\n\nPositions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nSo (2,3) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is where head will be on turn 47 if I move there.\n\nTurn 47: move R to (2,2), new head at (2,2), then body: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ... tail.\n\nSo (2,3) is still occupied.\n\nThen on turn 48, from (2,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,3) — body, invalid\n\nD to (2,1) — (2,1) free? y=1, (2,1) should be free, not wall or obstacle.\n\nL to (1,2) — body, invalid (since (1,2) is now body)\n\nR to (3,2) — food, and should be free.\n\nCurrent direction R, cannot move L.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nU invalid, L invalid.\n\nSo I can go R to (3,2) and eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSo turn 48: move R to (3,2) eat.\n\nThen I have eaten both foods.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nBut for the answer, I think I need to output actions from turn 42 onwards.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead, but output the actions for the turns.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, for turns where there is only one choice, it's fine, but I should specify.\n\nNow, for turn 42, action L.\n\nThen turn 43: D\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D\n\nBut turn 46 is to (1,2), eat.\n\nThen turn 47: R to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: R to (3,2)\n\nBut I don't need to go that far, but since I thought ahead.\n\nIn the initial state, head direction is U, and I move L, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nAfter moving L, new direction L.\n\nThen turn 43 move D, which is not opposite to L, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nIf I had gone R on turn 42, I might miss the food.\n\nSo I think L is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 42, action is L (left).\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of actions starting from turn 42, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. The key priorities are:\n- Eat the positive food at (1,2) before it disappears (life span 5 at turn 42, so must be eaten by turn 46).\n- Avoid the internal obstacle at (3,1) and walls.\n- Manage the snake's direction to prevent instant reversals and collisions.\n- After eating (1,2), target the food at (3,2) (life span 8 at turn 42, so must be eaten by turn 49).\n\nFrom the current state (turn 42):\n- Snake head is at (2,6) with direction U (up).\n- Moving up is invalid (wall at y=7), and moving down is invalid (body collision at (2,5)) and also an instant reverse (not allowed).\n- Possible moves: left (L) to (1,6) or right (R) to (3,6) (tail, safe).\n\nChoosing L to (1,6) is optimal because:\n- It allows a direct path to (1,2) in 4 moves (turns 43-46), ensuring it is eaten before it disappears.\n- The right move (R to (3,6)) leads to a less efficient path, risking the loss of (1,2) due to body obstructions near (3,2) and a longer route.\n- After eating (1,2), the snake can easily reach (3,2) by turn 48.\n\n### Planned Sequence (5+ turns ahead)\n- **Turn 42**: Move L (left) to (1,6).  \n  - Reason: Avoids walls/body, starts path to (1,2). New direction: L.\n- **Turn 43**: Move D (down) to (1,5).  \n  - Reason: Only valid move (U: wall, L: wall, R: body). Continues descent to (1,2). New direction: D.\n- **Turn 44**: Move D (down) to (1,4).  \n  - Reason: Only valid move (U: body, L: wall, R: body). Progress toward (1,2). New direction: D.\n- **Turn 45**: Move D (down) to (1,3).  \n  - Reason: Only valid move (U: body, L: wall, R: body). Sets up for eating (1,2) on next turn. New direction: D.\n- **Turn 46**: Move D (down) to (1,2) and eat food (+1 score, length increases to 15).  \n  - Reason: Eats (1,2) with life span 1 remaining (safe). New direction: D.\n- **Turn 47**: Move R (right) to (2,2).  \n  - Reason: Path to (3,2); D to (1,1) is valid but less direct; U and L invalid. New direction: R.\n- **Turn 48**: Move R (right) to (3,2) and eat food (+1 score, length increases to 16).  \n  - Reason: Eats (3,2) with life span 2 remaining (safe); U, D, L invalid or suboptimal.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods efficiently, avoids all risks (walls, body collisions, instant reverses), and ensures survival. After turn 48, the snake can explore open areas (e.g., around (4,2) or (2,1)) for more food, but the immediate plan is secure.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 43: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 44: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 45: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 46: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 47: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 48: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 43, and I have to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells. Internal obstacle at (3,1) means that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,6), and the body segments follow: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). That's 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (1,6)\n\n- Then (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) as tail.\n\nThe head direction is left (L), meaning it's moving left from the previous position. Since head is at (1,6) and direction is L, it came from the right, so previous head was at (2,6) or something. Snake positions show (1,6) is head, then (2,6) is next, so yes, it was moving left to (1,6).\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (3,2) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (5,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll are positive food since value is 1, and no negative food mentioned. Value 1 means +1 point and length increase.\n\nLife span: (1,2) has life 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including this one. Since current turn is 43, it will disappear after turn 46? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, at turn t, food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t + L? Or after turn t + L - 1?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and it disappears after N turns, that means after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span N, after one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears before turn t+N or something.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, life span is N, then at turn t+1, it becomes N-1, and so on. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So for food at (1,2) with life span 4 at turn 43:\n\n- Turn 43: life span 4\n\n- Turn 44: life span 3\n\n- Turn 45: life span 2\n\n- Turn 46: life span 1\n\n- Turn 47: life span 0, disappears before turn 47? Or at the end of turn 46?\n\nI think it's common to have it disappear when life span reaches 0, so after turn 46, before turn 47, it's gone. Similarly for others.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know when it's available.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 7 at turn 43, so available until turn 43+6=49? Let's calculate:\n\n- Turn 43: L=7\n\n- Turn 44: L=6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 49: L=1\n\n- Turn 50: L=0, disappears\n\nSo available from turn 43 to 49 inclusive? At turn 49, L=1, so it can be eaten on turn 49, then disappears after that.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) L=10, available until turn 52.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,6), direction L (left). So possible moves from here: since direction is L, I can move U (up), D (down), or L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right. Possible moves: U, D, or L.\n\nBut I have to consider the grid and obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls. And (3,1) is wall.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (1,6)\n\nBody: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nSo let's plot this:\n\nRow y=6: (1,6) head, (2,6), and (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — (4,6) is tail? Positions: (1,6), (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), so at y=6, we have (1,6), (2,6), and later (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nSimilarly, y=5: (2,5), (6,5)\n\ny=4: (2,4), (6,4)\n\ny=3: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nAnd (3,3) to (6,3) at y=3.\n\nNow food at (1,2), (3,2), (5,5)\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2\n\n(3,2) at x=3,y=2\n\n(5,5) at x=5,y=5\n\nHead at (1,6), so (1,2) is directly below but with obstacles? From (1,6) to (1,2), but there might be body or walls.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (1,6):\n\n- Up (U): to (1,7) but y=7 is wall, so cannot.\n\n- Down (D): to (1,5)\n\n- Left (L): to (0,6) but x=0 is wall, so cannot.\n\n- Right (R): but cannot because direction is L, and R is opposite, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is Down to (1,5).\n\nIs that right?\n\ny=7 is wall, so (1,7) is invalid.\n\nx=0 is wall, so (0,6) invalid.\n\nRight is not allowed due to direction.\n\nSo only Down to (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) is not occupied by snake body? Let's see snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), etc. (1,5) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n\nAlso, no food there.\n\nSo from (1,6), only move is D to (1,5).\n\nBut that seems too constrained. Let me double-check.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]\n\nSo cells occupied: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nSo (1,5) is not occupied, and no wall except borders and (3,1).\n\n(1,5) is within bounds, x=1,y=5, not wall.\n\nSo yes, only possible move is Down to (1,5).\n\nBut after moving, the direction changes. I need to think ahead.\n\nSince I have to plan multiple turns, I should consider the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t=43, head at (1,6), move D to (1,5).\n\nThen on turn 44, head at (1,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,6), but (1,6) is now the second segment? After move, snake positions: when head moves to (1,5), the tail moves, so the body segments shift.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten, so tail (4,6) is removed? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), ..., up to tail (4,6)\n\nAfter move down to (1,5):\n\nNew head: (1,5)\n\nThen the body: previous head (1,6) becomes new neck, so positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), then (2,6), then (2,5), ..., and since no food, tail (4,6) is removed.\n\nThe segments: after move, the first body segment is the old head position, which is (1,6), then the next is (2,6), which was second, then (2,5) which was third, and so on, up to (5,6) or something. Let's list:\n\nOld positions: index 0: (1,6) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,6), 12: (5,6), 13: (4,6) tail.\n\nAfter move down, new head at (1,5), old head (1,6) becomes body segment 1, then segment 1 (2,6) becomes segment 2, segment 2 (2,5) becomes segment 3, ..., and tail segment 13 (4,6) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,5), then body: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) and (4,6) is gone, so tail is now (5,6).\n\nSegments: new index 0: (1,5), 1: (1,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,5), 12: (6,6), 13: (5,6) — (5,6) was 12 in old? Old had 14 segments, after move, 13 segments since no growth.\n\nOld had 14 positions, after move, head new, body from old 0 to 12, but old 0 becomes body, old 1 to 13 become new body, but since no growth, the last one is removed, so new positions: new head + old positions 0 to 12, but old 0 is now first body, old 1 to 12 are next, and old 13 removed.\n\nStandard: new head position, then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: [new head] + [previous positions without last]\n\nSo new: head (1,5), then previous (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — (5,6) was the second last, (6,6) was last? Previous positions: index 0 to 13: 0:(1,6), 1:(2,6), 2:(2,5), 3:(2,4), 4:(2,3), 5:(3,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(5,3), 8:(6,3), 9:(6,4), 10:(6,5), 11:(6,6), 12:(5,6), 13:(4,6)\n\nSo without last, so new body: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — and tail is (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is the last body segment now.\n\nBut (4,6) is gone.\n\nNow, on turn 44, head at (1,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves from (1,5):\n\n- U: to (1,6) — but (1,6) is now occupied by the first body segment. After move, (1,6) is the second segment, so head cannot move there, collision.\n\n- D: to (1,4) — is this free? y=4, x=1. (1,4) not in snake positions, not wall, so possible.\n\n- L: to (0,5) — x=0 is wall, cannot.\n\n- R: to (2,5) — (2,5) is occupied by body? New positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), ... (2,5) is the fourth segment? Segments: 0: (1,5), 1: (1,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (2,5), so (2,5) is occupied, so cannot move right to (2,5).\n\nAlso, direction is D, so moving right is not opposite; opposite would be U, since down to up.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so opposite is U. So I can move D, L, or R, but L and R are perpendicular.\n\nFrom (1,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: opposite, not allowed.\n\n- D: down to (1,4)\n\n- L: left to (0,5) wall, invalid\n\n- R: right to (2,5)\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied by the snake body at position 3: (2,5)\n\nSo moving to (2,5) would collide with body.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is D to (1,4).\n\nIs (1,4) free? Yes, not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo on turn 44, must move D to (1,4).\n\nThen turn 45, head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,5) — but (1,5) is now the first body segment (since head moved to (1,4), old head (1,5) becomes body), so occupied, cannot.\n\n- D: to (1,3)\n\n- L: to (0,4) wall, cannot\n\n- R: to (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is occupied? After previous move to (1,4), new positions: head (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)? Let's list.\n\nPrevious on turn 44: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nAfter move down to (1,4): new head (1,4), then body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — and (5,6) removed, so tail is (6,6).\n\n(2,4) is part of body, segment 5? Positions: index 0: (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (2,5), 5: (2,4), etc.\n\nSo (2,4) is occupied.\n\nTherefore, from (1,4), move D to (1,3) is possible? (1,3) not occupied? Current body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ... (2,3) is there.\n\n(1,3) is not in the list, so free.\n\nMove R to (2,4) but occupied, so only D to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at y=3, x=1.\n\nNow, is there wall? (3,1) is wall, but (1,3) is not.\n\nSo move D to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 46, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,4) — but (1,4) is now body (previous head), occupied.\n\n- D: to (1,2) — (1,2) has food! But let's see.\n\n- L: to (0,3) wall, cannot\n\n- R: to (2,3) — (2,3) is occupied? Current positions: after move to (1,3), new head (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) is segment 7? Positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — tail (6,6), and (5,6) was removed earlier.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, so cannot move R.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) has food with value 1, life span 4 at turn 43.\n\nAt turn 43, life span 4, so on turn 46, what is life span?\n\nTurn 43: L=4\n\nTurn 44: L=3\n\nTurn 45: L=2\n\nTurn 46: L=1, so still available, can be eaten on turn 46.\n\nIf head moves to (1,2) on turn 46, it eats the food.\n\nThen snake grows, so tail is not removed, length increases.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, from (1,3), move D to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (6,6), head at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (1,2), then body includes old head (1,3), etc., and since food eaten, tail stays, so the segment that was tail remains, and new head is added, so snake grows.\n\nPositions after eating: new head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — and since food eaten, no removal, so 15 segments.\n\nNow, but I need to think ahead. This is one path, but at turn 43, I have only one choice: move down.\n\nThen at turn 44, only down, turn 45 only down, turn 46 eat food at (1,2).\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns, and there are other foods.\n\nFirst, at turn 43, I must move down to (1,5), no choice.\n\nThen turn 44, must move down to (1,4), no choice.\n\nThen turn 45, must move down to (1,3), no choice.\n\nThen turn 46, move down to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nAfter that, on turn 46, head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nNow, possible moves: from (1,2), direction down.\n\n- U: to (1,3) — (1,3) is now the first body segment, occupied, cannot.\n\n- D: to (1,1) — is (1,1) free? Not occupied, not wall? Walls: y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not border, x=1, so (1,1) should be free unless obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not (1,1), so (1,1) is free.\n\n- L: to (0,2) wall, cannot\n\n- R: to (2,2) — (2,2) is free? Not in snake positions.\n\nSnake positions after eating at (1,2): head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo (2,2) not occupied, free.\n\nAlso, direction D, so U is opposite, not allowed, so cannot move up.\n\nPossible moves: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nNow, I need to think about other foods.\n\nFood at (3,2) and (5,5).\n\n(3,2) has life span 7 at turn 43, so at turn 46, L=4? Turn 43: L=7, turn 44: L=6, turn 45: L=5, turn 46: L=4, so available.\n\n(5,5) L=10 at turn 43, turn 46: L=7, available.\n\nNow, from (1,2), I can go down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\nIf I go down to (1,1), then I might be stuck.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom, y=1, and y=0 is wall, so from (1,1), I can only go right or up, but up to (1,2) occupied.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf on turn 46, move D to (1,1):\n\nHead to (1,1), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), etc. with tail.\n\nThen from (1,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,2) occupied, cannot\n\n- D: to (1,0) but y=0 wall, cannot\n\n- L: to (0,1) wall, cannot\n\n- R: to (2,1) — (2,1) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo only move R to (2,1).\n\nThen turn 47, head at (2,1), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (2,1):\n\n- U: to (2,2)\n\n- D: to (2,0) wall, cannot\n\n- L: to (1,1) occupied, cannot\n\n- R: to (3,1) but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move U to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) should be free, no food or anything.\n\nThen move U to (2,2).\n\nNow at (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,3) — but (2,3) is occupied by body? Current positions after move to (2,2): previous head (2,1), body from before: after move to (2,1), positions: head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ... but (1,1) is first body, (1,2), etc.\n\n(2,3) is in body: let's list.\n\nAfter turn 46: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nThen move to (1,1): new head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — tail (6,5) or (6,6)? Old tail (6,6), but since no food, tail removed? When moving to (1,1), no food eaten, so tail removed.\n\nOld positions: 16 segments? After eating at (1,2), 15 segments: head (1,2), and 14 body? Earlier I said 15 positions.\n\nAt turn 46 after eating: positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — that's 16 positions? Head and 15 body? No.\n\nSnake positions include head, so after eating, length increased, so 15 segments: indices 0 to 14.\n\n0: (1,2), 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,4), 14: (6,5) — and (6,6) was tail but since we ate food, it stays? When you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment remains.\n\nAt turn 46, after moving to (1,2) and eating, positions are: new head (1,2), then the previous positions except the tail is not removed, so all previous body segments are kept.\n\nPrevious before move: at turn 45 head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — 15 positions including head? Turn 45: head (1,3), and 14 body segments? Let's count.\n\nAt turn 45, before move to (1,3): from earlier.\n\nAt turn 44, head (1,4), positions: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — 14 segments.\n\nThen move to (1,3): new head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — and (6,6) removed, so 14 segments.\n\nThen at turn 46, move to (1,2) and eat food: new head (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — and since food eaten, no removal, so the tail (6,5) stays, and we have 15 segments.\n\nPositions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — that's 15 positions.\n\n(6,6) was removed earlier, not here.\n\nNow back to turn 46, after eating at (1,2), head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nMove D to (1,1): new head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — and (6,5) removed, so tail (6,4).\n\nThen from (1,1), move R to (2,1): new head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — tail (6,3).\n\nThen from (2,1), move U to (2,2): new head (2,2), body (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3).\n\nNow at (2,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,3) — but (2,3) is occupied, in body, segment 11? Positions: 0:(2,2), 1:(2,1), 2:(1,1), 3:(1,2), 4:(1,3), 5:(1,4), 6:(1,5), 7:(1,6), 8:(2,6), 9:(2,5), 10:(2,4), 11:(2,3), 12:(3,3), 13:(4,3), 14:(5,3) — so (2,3) is index 11, occupied.\n\n- D: to (2,1) occupied, cannot\n\n- L: to (1,2) occupied, cannot\n\n- R: to (3,2) — (3,2) has food! And it's free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,2) is food position, value 1.\n\nAlso, direction U, so moving right is allowed.\n\nSo can move R to (3,2) to eat food.\n\nBut life span: at turn 47, what is life span of (3,2)? Turn 43 L=7, turn 44 L=6, turn 45 L=5, turn 46 L=4, turn 47 L=3, so available.\n\nSo on turn 47, after moving to (2,2), I can eat (3,2).\n\nBut in this path, I moved to (2,2) on turn 47? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 43: move D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 44: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 45: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 46: move D to (1,2) eat food\n\nThen turn 47: move D to (1,1) — but in the sequence above, I moved to (1,1) on turn 47? Turn 46 is move to (1,2), so turn 47 is from (1,2).\n\nIn my earlier, at turn 46 after eating, head at (1,2), then on turn 47, I moved to (1,1), then turn 48 to (2,1), turn 49 to (2,2).\n\nBut at (2,2), on turn 49, I can move to (3,2).\n\nBut let's see the food at (3,2) life span.\n\nTurn 43: L=7\n\nTurn 44: L=6\n\nTurn 45: L=5\n\nTurn 46: L=4\n\nTurn 47: L=3\n\nTurn 48: L=2\n\nTurn 49: L=1\n\nTurn 50: L=0, disappear.\n\nSo on turn 49, L=1, can be eaten.\n\nIn this path, on turn 49, I am at (2,2), move to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut I have to consider if I can get there earlier.\n\nAlternative at turn 46: from (1,2), instead of moving down, I could move right to (2,2).\n\nThen I can reach (3,2) faster.\n\nTurn 46: head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nMove R to (2,2): new head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — and (6,5) removed, tail (6,4).\n\nDirection now R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,3) — (2,3) is occupied, body segment 9? Positions: 0:(2,2), 1:(1,2), 2:(1,3), 3:(1,4), 4:(1,5), 5:(1,6), 6:(2,6), 7:(2,5), 8:(2,4), 9:(2,3), 10:(3,3), etc. so (2,3) occupied.\n\n- D: to (2,1) — free? Not occupied, possible.\n\n- L: to (1,2) occupied, cannot\n\n- R: to (3,2) — free, and food, can eat.\n\nDirection R, so moving left is opposite? Opposite to R is L, but L is to (1,2) occupied anyway.\n\nSo can move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I move R to (3,2) on turn 47, I eat the food immediately.\n\nTurn 47: from (2,2) move R to (3,2) eat food.\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nAfter eating, positions: new head (3,2), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), etc. with no tail removal.\n\nThen I have to move from there.\n\nBut let's compare.\n\nFirst, in the forced path, I eat (1,2) on turn 46, then if I go down, I eat (3,2) on turn 49.\n\nIf from (1,2) I go right to (2,2) on turn 46, then to (3,2) on turn 47, I eat (3,2) earlier.\n\nAnd (1,2) is already eaten, so not available.\n\nFood (1,2) life span: at turn 46 L=1, eaten, so gone.\n\n(3,2) L=4 at turn 46, etc.\n\nBut in terms of score, I get both foods, but timing might matter for other things.\n\nNow, there is also (5,5) food.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter eating (1,2) and (3,2), I am at (3,2) or somewhere.\n\nTo maximize, I should try to get to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) has long life, L=10 at turn 43, so available until turn 52.\n\nNow, back to turn 43, I have no choice but to move down.\n\nSimilarly, turn 44 down, turn 45 down, turn 46 to (1,2) eat.\n\nThen at turn 46, from (1,2), I can choose to go right to (2,2) or down to (1,1).\n\nIf I go right to (2,2), then on turn 47, from (2,2) I can go to (3,2) to eat or to (2,1).\n\nSince (3,2) is food, I should eat it on turn 47.\n\nThen after that, head at (3,2), direction R (if I moved right).\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,3) — (3,3) is occupied? After eating at (3,2), positions: new head (3,2), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — since ate food, tail not removed, so (3,3) is segment 11? Index 0: (3,2), 1: (2,2), 2: (1,2), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,6), 7: (2,6), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (3,3), 12: (4,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (6,3), 15: (6,4) — so (3,3) is occupied.\n\n- D: to (3,1) but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n- L: to (2,2) occupied, cannot\n\n- R: to (4,2) — (4,2) free? Not occupied, possible.\n\nDirection R, so moving L is opposite, not allowed, so cannot move left anyway.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,2).\n\nThen to (4,2), and so on.\n\nI can go to (5,2), (6,2), but (6,2) might be near walls.\n\nBut I need to get to (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go up or down, but body is above.\n\nThe snake body is mostly at y=3 and above, so from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied, or D to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nSince I have to plan 5+ turns, and at turn 43, I must move down, the sequence is forced until turn 46.\n\nThen at turn 46, I have a choice.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turns starting from t1.\n\nt1=43, so I need to output actions for turn 43, 44, 45, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nSince from 43 to 46 is forced, I can output those.\n\nThen for later turns, I need to specify.\n\nBut I should think about the food at (5,5).\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,2) must be eaten by turn 46 since L=1 on turn 46, disappears after.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) can be eaten later.\n\nBut in the path where I go down to (1,1), I might not get to (3,2) in time if I go that way, but I can, as I did earlier.\n\nBut if I go right from (1,2), I can eat (3,2) on turn 47, which is better.\n\nThen after that, I can head towards (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, which is currently occupied by body? At turn 43, (5,3) is body, but (5,5) is not, it has food.\n\nLater, it might be free.\n\nAfter eating (1,2) and (3,2), the snake is longer, and body is around.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,2) on turn 47, head at (3,2), move to (4,2) on turn 48.\n\nThen turn 48: head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,3) — but (4,3) is occupied, in body, segment 12? After move to (4,2): from previous, after move to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), etc. (4,3) is in body.\n\n- D: to (4,1) — free? Not occupied, possible.\n\n- L: to (3,2) occupied, cannot\n\n- R: to (5,2) — free, possible.\n\nSo move to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nIf to (5,2), then to (5,1) or (6,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to get to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at y=5, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go U to (5,3), but (5,3) might be occupied.\n\nAt turn 48, positions: if head at (5,2), let's not trace.\n\nTo reach (5,5), I can go via (4,2) to (4,1) or (5,2), then up, but the row y=3 has body, so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move D to (4,1), then to (5,1), then to (5,2), but (5,2) might be free, then to (5,3)? (5,3) is body.\n\nAt some point, the tail moves, so cells become free.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nFrom (4,2), move R to (5,2), then from (5,2), I can move U to (5,3) if free, but (5,3) is occupied until the tail moves.\n\nWith 16 segments or so, it takes many moves to free cells.\n\nBut (5,5) has life until turn 52, so I have time.\n\nBut to plan 5 turns from turn 43, I can output the forced moves.\n\nTurn 43: only possible move is D\n\nTurn 44: from (1,5), only move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 45: from (1,4), only move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 46: from (1,3), only move D to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nThen at turn 46, after eating, head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nNow for turn 47, I have choices: move D to (1,1) or move R to (2,2).\n\nI should choose to move R to (2,2) to get closer to (3,2) and (5,5).\n\nMoving down to (1,1) might dead end.\n\nSo better to go right.\n\nThen on turn 47, from (1,2), move R to (2,2).\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen on turn 48, from (2,2), I can move R to (3,2) to eat food, or D to (2,1).\n\nBut moving to (3,2) eats food, good.\n\nSo I should do that.\n\nThen turn 48: move to (3,2) eat.\n\nBut turn 48 is from (2,2) to (3,2).\n\nIn terms of turn numbers.\n\nTurn 46: at (1,2), move R to (2,2) — this is turn 46 action? Turn 46 is the move to (1,2), which we did.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nAt the start of turn 43, head at (1,6), we move to (1,5) during turn 43.\n\nSimilarly, turn 44: move from (1,5) to (1,4)\n\nTurn 45: move from (1,4) to (1,3)\n\nTurn 46: move from (1,3) to (1,2) and eat.\n\nNow, after turn 46, head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nNow for turn 47: we need to choose move.\n\nIf we move R to (2,2), then during turn 47, head moves to (2,2).\n\nThen at start of turn 48, head at (2,2), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 48, we can move R to (3,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, we can eat (3,2) on turn 48.\n\nLife span: turn 48, (3,2) L=2? Turn 43 L=7, turn 44 L=6, turn 45 L=5, turn 46 L=4, turn 47 L=3, turn 48 L=2, so yes, available.\n\nEat on turn 48.\n\nThen for later, we can plan to go to (5,5).\n\nBut for the answer, since we need to output for multiple turns, I can output up to turn 48 or so.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so from turn 43, at least to turn 48.\n\nAlso, for the food at (1,2), we eat it on turn 46, good.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 43: move D\n\nTurn 44: move D\n\nTurn 45: move D\n\nTurn 46: move D (to eat (1,2))\n\nThen turn 47: move R (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 48: move R (to (3,2) to eat)\n\nNow, for turn 49, I need to specify, but I can stop at 5 turns or more.\n\nSince the snake is long, and after eating (3,2), head at (3,2), we move to (4,2) on turn 49, for example.\n\nBut let's see possible.\n\nAfter turn 48: move to (3,2) eat, head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 49, only move R to (4,2), as we said earlier.\n\nThen turn 50, from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) or R to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut I can output up to turn 48 for now.\n\nSince the question is to maximize score, and we eat two foods quickly.\n\nAlso, avoid risks; in this path, no immediate risk.\n\nNow, another thing: at turn 43, is there any other possibility? Earlier I thought only down, but let's confirm the initial state.\n\nHead at (1,6), direction L.\n\nMoves: U to (1,7) invalid wall.\n\nD to (1,5) valid.\n\nL to (0,6) invalid wall.\n\nR invalid opposite.\n\nSo only D.\n\nSimilarly, next moves forced until turn 46.\n\nAt turn 46, after moving to (1,2), if I move down to (1,1), I can still get to (3,2) but later, as I did, on turn 49, but by going right, I eat on turn 48, better.\n\nAnd (1,2) life is short, so eating it is good.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life longer, but eating early is fine.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 43: D\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D (to eat food at (1,2))\n\nTurn 47: R (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 48: R (to (3,2) to eat)\n\nI can add turn 49: from (3,2) move R to (4,2)\n\nBut since direction is R, and only possible move, as above.\n\nThen turn 50: from (4,2), move to (5,2) or (4,1), but I can decide to go towards (5,5).\n\nFor example, move R to (5,2), then U to (5,3) when free, but not yet.\n\nBut for the output, I think 5 moves are enough, from turn 43 to 47 or 48.\n\nTurn 43 to 47 is 5 turns: 43,44,45,46,47.\n\nOr to 48.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 46 is D, turn 47 R, turn 48 R.\n\nSo I can output up to turn 48.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this case, no issue, since tail is far.\n\nAlso, food under body: but (1,2) is not under body, it was free.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Planned Moves\n\n**Current State (Turn 43):**\n- **Snake Head Position**: (1, 6)\n- **Snake Direction**: Left (L)\n- **Grid Constraints**: \n  - Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1).\n  - Snake body occupies: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] (14 segments).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,2): value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 46).\n  - (3,2): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 49).\n  - (5,5): value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 52).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- From (1,6) with direction L:\n  - Up (U) to (1,7): Invalid (y=7 wall).\n  - Down (D) to (1,5): Valid (empty cell).\n  - Left (L) to (0,6): Invalid (x=0 wall).\n  - Right (R): Invalid (instant reverse from L not allowed).\n- Only possible move at turn 43 is **D (down)** to (1,5).\n- Subsequent moves are constrained until turn 46 due to body positions and walls, leading to the food at (1,2) being eaten on turn 46 to avoid missing it (life span 4, expires after turn 46).\n- After turn 46, prioritize reaching (3,2) for efficient eating and then position for (5,5) long-term. Moving right from (1,2) on turn 47 is optimal to approach (3,2) quickly, avoiding dead ends near (1,1).\n\n**5+ Turn Plan (Prioritizing Survival and Score Maximization):**\n1. **Turn 43**: Move down (D) to (1,5) – only valid move.\n2. **Turn 44**: Move down (D) to (1,4) – only valid move from (1,5) with direction D.\n3. **Turn 45**: Move down (D) to (1,3) – only valid move from (1,4) with direction D.\n4. **Turn 46**: Move down (D) to (1,2) – eats positive food (+1 score, length +1), avoids expiration.\n5. **Turn 47**: Move right (R) to (2,2) – positions for (3,2), avoids risky down move to (1,1) which limits options.\n6. **Turn 48**: Move right (R) to (3,2) – eats positive food (+1 score, length +1), efficient use of life span.\n7. **Beyond (for context)**: \n   - Turn 49: Move right (R) to (4,2) – only valid move from (3,2) with direction R.\n   - Then aim for (5,5) via safe path (e.g., down to (4,1) or right to (5,2) when possible), leveraging long life span of (5,5).\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Avoids dead ends (e.g., moving down to (1,1) traps the snake). Path ensures open space for maneuvering.\n- **Food Timing**: Eats (1,2) just before expiration (turn 46) and (3,2) efficiently (turn 48), maximizing score. (5,5) can be targeted later with minimal risk.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: No tail reward danger (tail is distant) or body collisions in the plan.\n- **Life Span Tracking**:\n  - (1,2): Eaten on turn 46 (L=1, valid).\n  - (3,2): Eaten on turn 48 (L=2, valid).\n  - (5,5): L=7 at turn 48, ample time (disappears after turn 52).\n\n**Planned Moves (Output Format):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: D (down)  \nTurn 44: D (down)  \nTurn 45: D (down)  \nTurn 46: D (down)  \nTurn 47: R (right)  \nTurn 48: R (right)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 44, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,5), and the body segments follow. The direction is down (D), which means the snake was moving downward to get to (1,5). Since it's moving down, the previous position was above, but looking at the positions: [(1,5), (1,6), ...]. (1,6) is above (1,5) because y increases upward? No, let's clarify the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, (0,0) might be the bottom-left or top-left. But here, the walls are given as y=0 and y=7, and snake positions: (1,5) to (1,6). (1,6) has a higher y-value, so if y=0 is bottom, then y=6 is higher up, so moving from (1,6) to (1,5) is moving down, which matches the head direction D.\n\nSo, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nHead at (1,5), direction down, so it came from (1,6) to (1,5).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (1,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (1,2), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including this turn? Let's see the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 44, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 46? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n\n- At turn t, countdown = N\n\n- After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + N - 1, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n\nFor food at (1,2), life span 3 at turn 44: can be eaten on turns 44, 45, 46. Disappears after turn 46.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 6: can be eaten turns 44 to 49.\n\n(5,5) life span 9: turns 44 to 52.\n\nNow, snake positions: list all to understand the body.\n\nSnake: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nTail: (5,6)\n\nLength: 14 segments.\n\nNow, head direction is down, so it just moved to (1,5) from (1,6).\n\nPossible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on this turn.\n\nPossible moves from (1,5):\n\n- Down: to (1,4)\n\n- Left: to (0,5) but x=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- Right: to (2,5)\n\n- Up: not allowed, and also (1,6) is body, but let's check.\n\nFrom (1,5), moving:\n\n- Down: (1,4) - is this free? Need to check if it's wall or body.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,4) is within bounds, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1), not here.\n\nBody: snake positions: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc. (2,5) is a body segment, but it's not the head position.\n\n(1,4) is not in the snake positions, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, right: to (2,5). (2,5) is a body segment? Positions: index 3 is (2,5), which is the fourth segment? Head is index 0: (1,5), index 1: (1,6), index 2: (2,6), index 3: (2,5), so (2,5) is occupied by the body.\n\nBut rule: moving into body is deadly, except for the tail, because tail will move.\n\nTail is (5,6), so (2,5) is not tail, it's a body segment, so moving to (2,5) would collide with body and die.\n\nSimilarly, up: to (1,6), but (1,6) is index 1, body segment, and also instant reverse not allowed.\n\nLeft: to (0,5), but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nDown: to (1,4), which seems free.\n\nIs (1,4) occupied? Not in positions: positions are (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ... (2,4) is index 4, so (1,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nBut let's list all positions to confirm:\n\n(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nSo (1,4) is not occupied, and not wall, so down is possible.\n\nAre there any other moves? Left is wall, right is body ( (2,5) ), up not allowed and body.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,4)? But that can't be right; I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Head at (1,5), direction down, so from (1,6) to (1,5), so moving down.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will update. When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the segment at tail end is removed.\n\nSo if I move down to (1,4), new head is (1,4), tail (5,6) is removed, so new positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)] wait no.\n\nOriginal positions: 14 segments.\n\nAfter move, head moves to (1,4), and tail is removed, so the new body is: head (1,4), then the previous head (1,5) becomes second segment, then (1,6), then (2,6), and so on, up to (6,6), but (6,6) was second last, tail was (5,6), so after tail removed, (6,6) is new tail? Let's index.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: head (1,5), 1: (1,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,5), 12: (6,6), 13: tail (5,6)\n\nAfter moving down to (1,4), new head is (1,4), then segments: new position 0: (1,4), then 1: old 0 (1,5), 2: old 1 (1,6), 3: old 2 (2,6), 4: old 3 (2,5), 5: old 4 (2,4), 6: old 5 (2,3), 7: old 6 (3,3), 8: old 7 (4,3), 9: old 8 (5,3), 10: old 9 (6,3), 11: old 10 (6,4), 12: old 11 (6,5), 13: old 12 (6,6) — and old tail (5,6) is gone, so new tail is (6,6).\n\nLength remains 14 since no food eaten.\n\nBut I need to consider food.\n\nNow, back to possible moves at turn 44.\n\nFrom (1,5), only down to (1,4) is valid? But is that true?\n\nWhat about the tail? The tail is at (5,6), which is not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nBut moving to (1,4) is safe for now.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are other options. Left to (0,5): x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nRight to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by index 3, which is a body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nUp to (1,6): (1,6) is occupied by index 1, body segment, and also instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo indeed, only down to (1,4) is possible at turn 44? But that seems limiting. Perhaps I need to think about the food or future moves.\n\nBut the rule says: I have to choose an action, and for this turn, only down is valid? But let's double-check the positions.\n\nSnake positions: (1,5) head, (1,6) which is above, so (1,6) is occupied, (2,6) right of that, etc.\n\n(2,5) is directly to the right of head at (1,5), and it's occupied.\n\n(1,4) below is free.\n\nBut is there food? Food at (1,2), which is below, but not adjacent yet.\n\nSince only one move is possible, I must go down to (1,4).\n\nBut the problem is to think multiple turns ahead, so for turn 44, I have to choose, and only one choice.\n\nBut let's list all adjacent cells to head (1,5):\n\n- Up: (1,6) - occupied by body, and reverse, invalid\n\n- Down: (1,4) - free\n\n- Left: (0,5) - wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,5) - occupied by body (index 3), invalid\n\nSo yes, only down is possible for turn 44.\n\nSo for turn 44, action must be D.\n\nThen, after that, at turn 45, head is at (1,4), and direction is down (since I moved down).\n\nNow, from (1,4), possible moves.\n\nFirst, current direction down, so I can move down, left, right, but not up (reverse).\n\nMoves:\n\n- Down: to (1,3)\n\n- Left: to (0,4) wall, invalid\n\n- Right: to (2,4)\n\n- Up: to (1,5) - but (1,5) is now the second segment after move, but let's see the state after turn 44 move.\n\nAfter turn 44, move D to (1,4):\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — tail (6,6)\n\n(2,4) is a body segment? In new positions, index 5 is (2,4)? Let's list:\n\nIndex 0: head (1,4)\n\nIndex 1: (1,5)  // previous head\n\nIndex 2: (1,6)  // previous index 1\n\nIndex 3: (2,6)  // previous index 2\n\nIndex 4: (2,5)  // previous index 3\n\nIndex 5: (2,4)  // previous index 4\n\nIndex 6: (2,3)  // previous index 5\n\nIndex 7: (3,3)  // previous index 6\n\nIndex 8: (4,3)  // previous index 7\n\nIndex 9: (5,3)  // previous index 8\n\nIndex 10: (6,3)  // previous index 9\n\nIndex 11: (6,4)  // previous index 10\n\nIndex 12: (6,5)  // previous index 11\n\nIndex 13: (6,6)  // previous index 12, new tail\n\n(5,6) was old tail, removed.\n\nNow, at (1,4), head.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (1,5) - occupied by index 1, body segment\n\n- Down: (1,3) - is this free? Not in positions, and not wall, so free\n\n- Left: (0,4) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,4) - occupied by index 5, body segment, not tail\n\nTail is (6,6), far away.\n\nSo possible moves from (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3) - free\n\n- Right to (2,4) - body, collision, invalid\n\n- Up to (1,5) - body and reverse? Current direction is down (since last move was down), so moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- Left invalid.\n\nSo only down to (1,3) is possible? That can't be; I'm stuck going down the left edge.\n\n(1,3) is free, yes.\n\nThen at turn 45, I must move down to (1,3).\n\nThen new head at (1,3), and so on.\n\nBut there's food at (1,2), which is below (1,3), so I can go to it.\n\nLet's think about the food.\n\nFood at (1,2): at turn 44, life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 44,45,46.\n\nTurn 44: head at (1,5), I move to (1,4), not eating.\n\nTurn 45: head at (1,4), move to (1,3), not eating.\n\nTurn 46: head at (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nBut at turn 46, head at (1,3), direction down, move down to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) has food with value 1, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nFirst, from turn 44 to 46.\n\nTurn 44: move D to (1,4) — no food, so tail removed, positions as above.\n\nTurn 45: from (1,4), only move D to (1,3) — no food at (1,3), so move to (1,3), new head (1,3), tail removed: tail was (6,6), so new positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 45 move to (1,3):\n\nHead: (1,3)\n\nThen: (1,4)  // previous head\n\nThen: (1,5)  // previous index 1\n\nThen: (1,6)  // previous index 2\n\nThen: (2,6)  // previous index 3\n\nThen: (2,5)  // previous index 4\n\nThen: (2,4)  // previous index 5\n\nThen: (2,3)  // previous index 6? After turn 44, index 6 was (2,3), but in turn 45 move, when I move to (1,3), the segments:\n\nNew index 0: (1,3)\n\nNew index 1: (1,4)  // old head\n\nNew index 2: (1,5)  // old index 1\n\nNew index 3: (1,6)  // old index 2\n\nNew index 4: (2,6)  // old index 3\n\nNew index 5: (2,5)  // old index 4\n\nNew index 6: (2,4)  // old index 5\n\nNew index 7: (2,3)  // old index 6\n\nNew index 8: (3,3)  // old index 7\n\nAnd so on, up to new index 13: (6,5)  // old index 12, since tail was removed, old index 12 (6,6) was tail? After turn 44, positions had 14 segments, tail (6,6).\n\nAfter turn 45 move to (1,3), no food, so tail removed: old tail (6,6) gone, so new segments from old index 0 to 12 except that head moved? Better: new head at (1,3), then the first 13 segments of previous positions except the tail is not included.\n\nPrevious after turn 44: positions [ (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ] 14 positions.\n\nAfter move to (1,3), new head (1,3), then the first 13 of previous: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — and (6,6) removed.\n\nSo new tail is (6,5).\n\nNow at turn 46, head at (1,3), direction down (last move down).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down to (1,2) — has food? Food at (1,2) is present, life span: at turn 44 it was 3, so turn 45 it becomes 2, turn 46 it becomes 1, then after turn 46 it disappears? Life span countdown.\n\nAt turn 44, food (1,2) life span 3.\n\nAfter turn 44, countdown decreases to 2.\n\nAfter turn 45, countdown decreases to 1.\n\nAfter turn 46, countdown decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 46, since during turn 46 it is still there.\n\nSo at turn 46, (1,2) has food.\n\nMove down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen, eating food: snake grows, so when I move to (1,2), head moves there, and tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nPositions: new head (1,2), then previous head (1,3) becomes body, and so on, tail stays.\n\nSo length increases to 15.\n\nBut is it safe? (1,2) is free, not body, not wall.\n\nAfter eating, the food is consumed, so removed.\n\nNow, but I need to think about the tail reward danger.\n\nHere, when I eat at (1,2), the head is at (1,2), tail is at (6,5), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSo eating (1,2) on turn 46 is fine.\n\nBut at turn 44 and 45, I have no choice but to go down to reach it.\n\nBut at turn 44, I can only go down, similarly turn 45.\n\nBut is there another food or something?\n\nThere is food at (3,2) and (5,5).\n\nBut at turn 44, I have to go down.\n\nPerhaps for turn 44, since only one move, I must choose D.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format: I need to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 44.\n\nThe problem says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut at turn 44, only one action is possible, so I should output that.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 44, action D.\n\nThen turn 45, from (1,4), only down to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 46, from (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nBut after that, what?\n\nAt turn 46, after eating (1,2), head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nThen I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (1,2):\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Left to (0,2) wall invalid\n\n- Right to (2,2)\n\n- Up to (1,3) - but (1,3) is body segment, and reverse? Current direction down, so up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\nNow, (1,1) is free? Not wall, not in body positions yet.\n\nAfter turn 46, positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — and tail is (6,5) since I ate, no tail move, so positions have 15 segments.\n\n(1,1) not occupied, so down to (1,1) possible.\n\nRight to (2,2): (2,2) is free? Not in positions, so yes.\n\nAlso, food at (3,2) and (5,5).\n\n(3,2) is at x=3,y=2, life span 6 at turn 44, so at turn 46, life span should be 4? Let's keep track of food life spans.\n\nAt turn 44:\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,2): life 3, disappears after turn 46\n\n- (3,2): life 6, disappears after turn 49? At turn 44, life 6, so can be eaten turns 44 to 49 (since after 6 decreases: t44:6, t45:5, t46:4, t47:3, t48:2, t49:1, t50:0 disappear)\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): life 9, t44:9, so t44 to 52.\n\nAt turn 46, after eating (1,2), head at (1,2).\n\nI can go right to (2,2) or down to (1,1).\n\nIf I go down to (1,1), then I might be cornered.\n\n(1,1) is above y=0, but y=0 is wall, so (1,1) is ok, but from there, I can go right or up, but up to (1,2) which is body.\n\nLet's think long-term.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eat other food.\n\nFood at (3,2) is close, at (3,2).\n\nFrom (1,2), going right to (2,2), then I can go to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut (3,2) has an internal obstacle? Obstacle at (3,1), not (3,2), so (3,2) should be free.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1), which is below (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is food position.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is another food.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the left and bottom, but let's see the grid.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid going down to (1,1) because it might lead to dead end.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I go down to (1,1), then at (1,1), possible moves:\n\n- Down to (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Left to (0,1) wall invalid\n\n- Right to (2,1)\n\n- Up to (1,2) body, and reverse not allowed if direction down.\n\nCurrent direction to (1,1) would be down, so from (1,1), moves: down invalid, left invalid, right to (2,1), up to (1,2) but body and reverse.\n\nSo only right to (2,1) possible.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle, or (2,0) invalid.\n\nBut (2,1) might be free.\n\nBut this seems messy, and I might not reach other food easily.\n\nBetter to go right from (1,2) to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to (3,2) to eat food.\n\n(3,2) has food, value 1.\n\nAt turn 46, I am at (1,2), I move to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\nIf I move right to (2,2), no food there, so tail moves.\n\nThen at turn 47, head at (2,2), direction right (since I moved right from (1,2) to (2,2)? From (1,2) to (2,2) is moving right, so direction R.\n\nThen from (2,2), possible moves: left, right, down, up? But no instant reverse, so cannot move left (opposite of right).\n\nCurrent direction right, so cannot move left.\n\nMoves:\n\n- Right to (3,2) — has food? (3,2) has food, so I can eat it.\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Up to (2,3)\n\n- Left to (1,2) — but reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: right to (3,2), down to (2,1), up to (2,3).\n\n(2,1) and (2,3) need to be free.\n\nFirst, at turn 46, after moving to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — 15 segments, tail (6,5).\n\n(2,1) is free? Not occupied.\n\n(2,3) is occupied? (2,3) is in positions, index 9? Positions: index 0: (2,2) head, index 1: (1,2), index 2: (1,3), ..., let's find (2,3).\n\nPrevious positions after turn 46: before move, head at (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,3) is there? After eating at turn 46, positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n(2,3) is index 8? Index 0: (1,2), 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3), etc.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), new head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — and tail (6,5) removed, so new tail (6,4).\n\n(2,3) is index 9 in new? New positions: head (2,2), then index 1: (1,2), index 2: (1,3), index 3: (1,4), index 4: (1,5), index 5: (1,6), index 6: (2,6), index 7: (2,5), index 8: (2,4), index 9: (2,3), index 10: (3,3), ..., up to index 14: (6,4) tail.\n\n(2,3) is occupied by index 9, so (2,3) is body.\n\nTherefore, from (2,2), moving:\n\n- Right to (3,2) — free? Not occupied, and not wall.\n\n- Down to (2,1) — free\n\n- Up to (2,3) — but (2,3) is occupied, body, invalid\n\n- Left not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: right to (3,2) or down to (2,1).\n\n(3,2) has food, so I should go right to eat it.\n\nThen at turn 47, move right to (3,2), eat food, grow to 16 segments.\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction right.\n\nNow, after that, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 44.\n\nAt turn 44, I must go down to (1,4).\n\nThen turn 45, down to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 46, from (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat, as planned.\n\nIn turn 46, from (1,3), I move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen at (1,2), I need to choose: go right to (2,2) or down to (1,1).\n\nIf I go down to (1,1), it might be risky, but let's see.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I go down to (1,1), then at (1,1), only move right to (2,1), as earlier.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle, or to (2,2), or (2,0) invalid, or (1,1) body.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2) or (3,1) obstacle, or (2,0) invalid, or (1,1) body and reverse if direction.\n\nBut to reach (3,2), from (2,1) I can go up to (2,2), but (2,2) might be occupied later.\n\nIt's messy, and I might miss the food at (3,2).\n\nBetter to go right from (1,2) to (2,2) directly.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to (3,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,5) is there.\n\nBut life span is long, so I have time.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nBut at turn 44, only one action: D.\n\nThen turn 45, from (1,4), only action: D to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 46, from (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut is there a choice? From (1,3), head at (1,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down to (1,2) — has food\n\n- Left to (0,3) wall invalid\n\n- Right to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (1,4) — body, and reverse not allowed.\n\nRight to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied? At turn 46, before move, head at (1,3), positions: after turn 45, we have head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), ..., tail (6,5)\n\n(2,3) is index 7 or something, occupied, so cannot move to (2,3).\n\nSo only down to (1,2) is possible at turn 46? Let's list positions at turn 46 before action.\n\nAfter turn 45: head at (1,3), positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] tail (6,5)\n\n(2,3) is index 7, occupied.\n\nSo from (1,3), only down to (1,2) is valid, since left invalid, right body, up reverse and body.\n\nSo I must go down to (1,2) and eat the food.\n\nThen at turn 46, head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nNow, from (1,2), I can go down to (1,1) or right to (2,2), as before.\n\nDown to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) is free, (2,2) is free.\n\nIf I go down to (1,1), then I have to go right to (2,1), etc., which might not be efficient.\n\nIf I go right to (2,2), then I can go to (3,2) to eat next turn.\n\nFood at (3,2) is still available.\n\nAt turn 46, after eating (1,2), the food (3,2) has life span: at turn 44, life 6, turn 45:5, turn 46:4, so still 4 turns left, can be eaten later.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,2), if I go right to (2,2), no food, so tail moves.\n\nThen at turn 47, head at (2,2), direction right (since moved right).\n\nThen I can move right to (3,2) to eat.\n\n(3,2) is free, so I eat and grow.\n\nThen after that, head at (3,2), I can go up, down, left, right, but not left reverse.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2): to (3,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,2) but left reverse not allowed.\n\n(3,3) is occupied? After eating at (3,2), positions include (3,3) as body.\n\nAfter turn 47: if I move to (3,2), eat, so new head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), etc., so (3,3) is still there? In positions, (3,3) is a segment.\n\nFrom (3,2), moving to (3,3) would be into body, collision.\n\n(3,1) is obstacle.\n\n(4,2) might be free.\n\n(2,2) is body, and left reverse.\n\nSo from (3,2), possible: down to (3,1) but obstacle, invalid; up to (3,3) body, invalid; left to (2,2) body and reverse invalid; right to (4,2) — which should be free.\n\nSo only right to (4,2) possible.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor the immediate turns, at turn 44, action D.\n\nTurn 45, action D.\n\nTurn 46, action D to (1,2) eat.\n\nThen at turn 47, from (1,2), I need to choose: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf I go R to (2,2), then turn 48, from (2,2) I can go R to (3,2) to eat, assuming (3,2) is still there.\n\nAt turn 47, if I move to (2,2), no eat, so (3,2) still there.\n\nThen turn 48, move to (3,2) eat.\n\nBut at turn 47, from (1,2), if I go down to (1,1), then turn 48 from (1,1) go R to (2,1), then turn 49 from (2,1) go U to (2,2) or R to (3,1) invalid, so U to (2,2), then I can go to (3,2) later, but it might be cutting close with life span.\n\nBetter to go directly right to (2,2) at turn 47.\n\nMoreover, going down to (1,1) might lead to dead end if not careful.\n\nSo I think it's better to go right at turn 47.\n\nNow for turn 44 to 46, actions are fixed: D, D, D.\n\nThen for turn 47, from (1,2), I choose R to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 48, from (2,2), move R to (3,2) to eat.\n\nThen turn 49, from (3,2), move R to (4,2), as only choice.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (5,5) or other areas.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output 5+ turns ahead, starting from turn 44.\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D (to eat (1,2))\n\nTurn 47: from (1,2) to (2,2), so R\n\nThen turn 48: from (2,2) to (3,2), R\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2) to (4,2), R\n\nBut at turn 49, after moving to (4,2), head at (4,2), direction right.\n\nThen I can go to (5,2) or other.\n\nBut I need to eat (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), which is up and right.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go up to (4,3), but (4,3) might be body.\n\nLet's not plan all, but for 5 turns, from turn 44 to 48 or 49.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t1=44.\n\nOutput for turn 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, etc.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nAt turn 44, action D\n\nTurn 45: action D\n\nTurn 46: action D (to (1,2))\n\nThen at turn 47, from (1,2), I have a choice: D or R.\n\nI think R is better to go towards other food.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 48, from (2,2), I can go R to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut is (3,2) still available? Yes, life span until turn 49.\n\nAt turn 47, if I move to (2,2), no eat, so (3,2) still there.\n\nTurn 48 move to (3,2) eat.\n\nNow, for turn 49, from (3,2), after eating, head at (3,2), direction right, only move to (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I think for the first few turns, it's determined.\n\nPerhaps I should output:\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D  // eats (1,2)\n\nTurn 47: R  // to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: R  // to (3,2) and eat\n\nThen turn 49: R  // to (4,2)\n\nBut at turn 49, from (3,2) to (4,2), but after turn 48, I eat at (3,2), so at turn 49, head at (3,2), move to (4,2).\n\nIn the sequence, turn 48 action is R to (3,2), which eats food, so at that point.\n\nBut for turn 49, action from (3,2) to (4,2), R.\n\nNow, to think about tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body: but in this case, no food under body mentioned.\n\nSo for now, this seems fine.\n\nBut at turn 47, from (1,2), if I go down to (1,1), it might be possible but riskier.\n\nFor example, if I go D to (1,1) at turn 47, then turn 48 from (1,1) move R to (2,1), then turn 49 from (2,1) move U to (2,2), then I can go to (3,2), but at turn 49, (3,2) might be eaten or not, but life span allows, but it takes more turns.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 49, I can go to (3,2) immediately if not eaten.\n\nBut in the first plan, I reach (3,2) by turn 48.\n\nIn the down plan, I reach (2,2) at turn 49, then to (3,2) at turn 50.\n\nBut at turn 50, (3,2) life span: from turn 44 life 6, turn 50 is t44+6, which is the last turn? Life span 6 at t44, disappears after turn 49, meaning after turn 49 it is gone, so at turn 50 it is not there.\n\nLife span N=6 at turn 44, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nt44:6, t45:5, t46:4, t47:3, t48:2, t49:1, after t49 it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 49, but not after.\n\nAt turn 50, it is gone.\n\nIn the first plan: turn 48 I eat (3,2).\n\nIn the down plan: at turn 49, I am at (2,2), I can move to (3,2) to eat on turn 49, which is possible.\n\nBut it takes one extra turn, and I have to go through (1,1) and (2,1), which might be unnecessary.\n\nSo better to go right directly at turn 47.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D  // to (1,2) eat\n\nTurn 47: R  // to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: R  // to (3,2) eat\n\nThen for turn 49, from (3,2) move R to (4,2)\n\nBut since I need to output 5+ turns, I can include up to turn 49.\n\nOr more.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nIn answer format, it should be a sequence.\n\nAlso, for the boxed answer.\n\nNow, another thing: at turn 48, when I move to (3,2), I eat, but is there any danger?\n\nHead at (3,2), tail is somewhere, not adjacent, so fine.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,1), but not affecting.\n\nThen from (3,2), only right to (4,2).\n\nAt (4,2), I can go to (5,2) or (4,3), etc., to reach (5,5).\n\nBut for now, I think the first 5 actions are set.\n\nTurn 44 to 48: D, D, D, R, R\n\nBut turn 44,45,46: D\n\nTurn 47: R to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: R to (3,2)\n\nThat's 5 actions.\n\nI can add turn 49: R to (4,2)\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 44, there is any other possibility, but I think not.\n\nAnother point: the food at (1,2) could be eaten earlier, but at turn 44, I cannot, since I have to move down first.\n\nUnless... but no.\n\nAlso, the special case about food under body: but here, no food is under body initially.\n\nFor example, is there food at (2,5) or something? No, food only at (1,2), (3,2), (5,5).\n\n(2,5) is body, but no food there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo for answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 44: D Turn 45: D Turn 46: D Turn 47: R Turn 48: R }\n\nBut turn 48 is to (3,2) to eat, which is good.\n\nTo be complete, I can add more, but I think 5 actions are enough for now.\n\nThe problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", and here going down and then right seems safe.\n\nGoing to (1,1) might risk if I get stuck, but not necessarily, but right is better.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 44 and Beyond\n\n**Current State (Turn 44):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (3,1)).\n- **Snake**: Head at (1,5) with direction down (D). Body segments: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] (length 14). Tail at (5,6).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,2): Value +1, life span 3 (can be eaten on turns 44, 45, 46; disappears after turn 46).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 6 (can be eaten on turns 44 to 49; disappears after turn 49).\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life span 9 (can be eaten on turns 44 to 52; disappears after turn 52).\n\n**Movement Constraints and Risks:**\n- Current direction is down (D), so instant reverse (up/U) is not allowed on turn 44.\n- From head position (1,5), only valid move is down (D) to (1,4) because:\n  - Left (L) to (0,5) is a wall (x=0).\n  - Right (R) to (2,5) is occupied by body segment (index 3; not tail).\n  - Up (U) to (1,6) is instant reverse and occupied by body.\n- After moving down on turn 44, the snake must continue down on turns 45 and 46 to reach and eat the food at (1,2) on turn 46. This is optimal as it secures +1 score and avoids letting the food expire.\n- After eating (1,2), moving right (R) on turn 47 toward (3,2) is prioritized for long-term score and survival. Moving down to (1,1) is possible but risky, as it leads to a dead-end near the wall (y=0), reducing access to other food and increasing collision risk.\n- Eating (3,2) on turn 48 is planned, as it expires soon (life span 1 on turn 49). This requires moving right on turns 47 and 48.\n- Post-turn 48, moving right to (4,2) is necessary to avoid collisions and position for reaching (5,5) later.\n\n**5+ Turn Lookahead Strategy:**\n- **Immediate Goal (Turns 44-46)**: Secure (1,2) before it expires. Only down moves are possible due to constraints.\n- **Medium Goal (Turns 47-48)**: Head toward (3,2) to eat it before expiration. Moving right is safe and efficient.\n- **Long-Term Goal (Post-Turn 48)**: Navigate toward (5,5) while avoiding obstacles. The path from (4,2) can go upward (e.g., to (4,3) or (5,2)) but requires careful planning to avoid body collisions (e.g., segments around (3,3) and (4,3)). Survival is prioritized; (5,5) has a long life span, so no rush.\n- **Risks Mitigated**:\n  - No tail reward danger: Tail is distant when eating (1,2) and (3,2).\n  - Body collisions avoided by not moving into occupied cells.\n  - Wall and obstacle (3,1) avoided.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 44 to 49):**\n- **Turn 44**: Move down (D) to (1,4). Only valid move; no food eaten.\n- **Turn 45**: Move down (D) to (1,3). Only valid move; no food eaten.\n- **Turn 46**: Move down (D) to (1,2). Eats food (+1 score, length increases to 15). Head now at (1,2), direction D.\n- **Turn 47**: Move right (R) to (2,2). Positions snake toward (3,2); no food eaten. Head now at (2,2), direction R.\n- **Turn 48**: Move right (R) to (3,2). Eats food (+1 score, length increases to 16). Head now at (3,2), direction R.\n- **Turn 49**: Move right (R) to (4,2). Only valid move (no reverse, body/wall blocks other directions). Positions for future movement toward (5,5). Head now at (4,2), direction R.\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating two positive foods quickly while ensuring survival. Post-turn 49, continue navigating open spaces (e.g., upward) to reach (5,5) safely.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 44\\text{: D} \\quad \\text{Turn } 45\\text{: D} \\quad \\text{Turn } 46\\text{: D} \\quad \\text{Turn } 47\\text{: R} \\quad \\text{Turn } 48\\text{: R} \\quad \\text{Turn } 49\\text{: R} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 45, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's 8x8? Let me check: x=0 to x=7 inclusive is 8 units, similarly for y. But walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the walls are the borders, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (1,4), and it's moving down (direction D). The positions are: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]. Since head is at (1,4) and direction is down, moving down would be to (1,3), but let's see the current position.\n\nHead is at (1,4), direction D, so last move was down to (1,4). From (1,5) to (1,4)? Positions: index 0 is head: (1,4), then body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), etc. So the snake is moving downwards. From (1,5) to (1,4) is down, yes.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all.\n\nLife span: for (1,2) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 45, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 46? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 45, life span 2, after turn 45 it becomes 1, after turn 46 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 45 or 46, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 5, so disappears after turn 49? Turn 45: life=5, turn 46:4, turn 47:3, turn 48:2, turn 49:1, turn 50:0 gone? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n\n- Turn t: life span L\n\n- After turn t, L decreases by 1\n\n- When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nSo for (1,2): life span 2 at turn 45. After turn 45, L=1 (still there). After turn 46, L=0, disappears. So available on turns 45 and 46.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): life span 5 at turn 45. After turn 45, L=4; ... after turn 49, L=0, disappears. So available turns 45 to 49.\n\n(5,5): life span 8, available turns 45 to 52.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,4), direction down. Possible moves: since current direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So cannot move up. Can move down, left, or right.\n\nNow, let's see the grid. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nPlayable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n\n(3,1) is an obstacle, so cell (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake body: positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nHead: (1,4)\n\nBody: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo the tail is (6,6).\n\nNow, food at (1,2), (3,2), (5,5).\n\n(1,2) is below head? Head at (1,4), down is decreasing y, I assume? Coordinates: y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y increases up or down? The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see.\n\nU: (x,y+1) — so if y increases, it's moving up, so higher y is up.\n\nD: (x,y-1) — lower y is down.\n\nSo head at (1,4), which is x=1, y=4.\n\nFood at (1,2): x=1, y=2, so directly below, since y=2 < y=4.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): x=3, y=2\n\n(5,5): x=5, y=5\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,4) with direction down:\n\n- Down: to (1,3)\n\n- Left: to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Right: to (2,4)\n\n- Up: but cannot, instant reverse.\n\nSo valid moves: down to (1,3) or right to (2,4)\n\nNow, (2,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (2,4) is in the list, it's the 5th segment? Positions: index 0: (1,4) head, index 1: (1,5), index 2: (1,6), index 3: (2,6), index 4: (2,5), index 5: (2,4), yes (2,4) is the body segment at index 5.\n\nBut can I move to (2,4)? Rule about body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail.\n\nHere, (2,4) is not the tail; tail is (6,6). So moving to (2,4) would cause collision and death.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3): is it occupied? Let's see snake positions: (2,3) is at index 6? Positions: ... (2,3) at index 6, (3,3) index 7, etc. (1,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but is it a wall? x=1, y=3, walls are borders and (3,1), so (1,3) should be free.\n\ny=3 is between 1 and 6, x=1 between 1 and 6, not obstacle.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- Down to (1,3): free, no collision\n\n- Right to (2,4): occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\n- Left: to (0,4) wall, invalid.\n\n- Up: invalid, instant reverse.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) is directly below, at (1,2).\n\nIf I move down to (1,3), then on next turn I can move down to (1,2) to eat the food.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's simulate.\n\nCurrent turn 45: head at (1,4), move down to (1,3). Then snake positions update: new head at (1,3), then body: the tail moves? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length increases, so tail stays, new head added.\n\nWithout eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed.\n\nSo if I move to (1,3) without eating, new positions: head at (1,3), then the body segments follow: previous head (1,4) becomes body, so positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] and tail (6,6) is removed, so length decreases? No.\n\nSnake has 14 segments: from (1,4) to (6,6), 14 positions.\n\nWhen moving without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n\nSo new head at (1,3), then the first body segment is the old head (1,4), then (1,5), and so on, up to (6,5), and (6,6) is removed. So new positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] — 14 segments? Original 14 segments, after move, head new position, tail removed, so 13 segments? Let's count.\n\nOriginal positions: 14 cells.\n\nAfter move: head to (1,3), then the body: positions 1 to 13 of original become the body from index 1 to 13, but since tail is removed, the new snake has the same segments except the tail is gone and head is new.\n\nEasier: the snake moves forward, so the cell that was head is now neck, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nNew positions: [new_head] + body[:-1] or something.\n\nSpecifically: new_head = (1,3)\n\nThen the body segments are the previous positions except the last one is removed.\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0 to 13: (1,4), (1,5), ..., (6,6)\n\nAfter moving down to (1,3): new head at (1,3), then the first body segment is previous head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), and the previous tail (6,6) is removed, so (6,5) is now the last body segment? Previous positions: index 12: (6,5), index 13: (6,6)\n\nSo after move, new body: from index 1: (1,4) to index 12: (6,5), and index 13 is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — that's 14 segments? (1,3) to (6,5) is 14 cells? List: 1.(1,3), 2.(1,4), 3.(1,5), 4.(1,6), 5.(2,6), 6.(2,5), 7.(2,4), 8.(2,3), 9.(3,3), 10.(4,3), 11.(5,3), 12.(6,3), 13.(6,4), 14.(6,5). Yes, still 14, but I removed the tail? Mistake.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, it does not grow, so length remains the same, but the tail moves.\n\nThe head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake occupies a new head position and loses the tail position.\n\nNumber of segments: if no food eaten, length unchanged, so from 14 segments, after move, still 14 segments, but shifted.\n\nNew head at (1,3), then the segments from index 0 to 12 of previous become the body segments 1 to 13? Previous index 0: head (1,4), after move, it becomes body segment at position 1.\n\nNew positions: new head at (1,3)\n\nThen segment 1: previous head (1,4)\n\nSegment 2: previous segment 1 (1,5)\n\nSegment 3: previous segment 2 (1,6)\n\nSegment 4: previous segment 3 (2,6)\n\nSegment 5: previous segment 4 (2,5)\n\nSegment 6: previous segment 5 (2,4)\n\nSegment 7: previous segment 6 (2,3)\n\nSegment 8: previous segment 7 (3,3)\n\nSegment 9: previous segment 8 (4,3)\n\nSegment 10: previous segment 9 (5,3)\n\nSegment 11: previous segment 10 (6,3)\n\nSegment 12: previous segment 11 (6,4)\n\nSegment 13: previous segment 12 (6,5)\n\nAnd previous segment 13 (6,6) is no longer part of snake; it's vacated.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nLength 14, tail at (6,5).\n\nNow, at turn 45, after moving to (1,3), I can consider turn 46.\n\nOn turn 46, head at (1,3), direction is down (since I moved down).\n\nFood at (1,2) is below, life span was 2 at turn 45, after turn 45, life span decreases to 1, so available on turn 46.\n\nIf I move down to (1,2), I eat the food.\n\nThen, since I eat positive food, length increases, so new head at (1,2), and tail does not move, so the previous tail (6,5) stays, and new positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), ..., up to (6,5), and the segment before tail is (6,4), but since tail doesn't move, the body is all previous positions.\n\nPrevious positions: head (1,3), body (1,4) to (6,5)\n\nAfter eating at (1,2): new head at (1,2), then the entire previous snake becomes body, so positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] — 15 segments, with tail at (6,5).\n\nBut is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (6,5), head at (1,2), not adjacent.\n\nBut the food at (1,2) is under the snake? No, (1,2) was free, I move to it.\n\nBut there's a special case: food can spawn under body, but in this case, (1,2) is not under body, it's free.\n\nIn the current state, food at (1,2) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions include (1,4) to (6,6), (1,2) is not listed, so free.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3) on turn 45, on turn 46 head at (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's see if that's safe.\n\nFirst, on turn 45, only move is down to (1,3), so I have to do that.\n\nBut for thinking ahead, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nThen possible moves: down to (1,1)? y=1, which is not wall, but is it free? Also, walls: y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable? Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, except obstacles.\n\n(1,1): is it occupied? After eating, snake is at (1,2), (1,3), etc., not (1,1), so free. No obstacle at (1,1), only (3,1) is obstacle.\n\nSo down to (1,1) possible.\n\nLeft to (0,1) wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,1)? (2,1) not occupied, free? Let's see.\n\nOr up to (1,3), but (1,3) is body, and direction is down, so moving up is instant reverse? Direction after moving to (1,2) is down, so cannot move up.\n\nCurrent direction after move to (1,2) is down.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (1,1), left invalid, right to (2,1), up invalid.\n\n(2,1) is x=2,y=1, should be free.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger for other food.\n\nFirst, back to turn 45.\n\nOn turn 45, I must move down to (1,3), no choice.\n\nThen on turn 46, head at (1,3), direction down.\n\nFood at (1,2) is below, life span 1, will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nI can move down to (1,2) to eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? Let's see the area.\n\nAfter eating, head at (1,2), as above.\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,1), or right to (2,1), or up to (1,3) but invalid instant reverse.\n\n(1,1) is free, I think.\n\n(2,1) is free.\n\nBut there is food at (3,2) and (5,5).\n\nAlso, after eating at (1,2), the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid eating it.\n\nOn turn 46, I could move right or something, but from (1,3), direction down, possible moves: down to (1,2), right to (2,3), left to (0,3) wall invalid, up to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, and moving up is instant reverse? Direction is down, opposite is up, so cannot move up.\n\nSo only down or right.\n\nMove right to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is occupied? In the positions after turn 45: snake at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc. (2,3) is in the list, it's the body segment at index 7 or something.\n\nAfter turn 45, positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nSo (2,3) is at index 7, which is body, not tail. Tail is (6,5).\n\nSo moving to (2,3) would be collision, invalid.\n\nTherefore, from (1,3), only possible move is down to (1,2), since right is occupied, left wall, up invalid.\n\nSo on turn 46, I must move down to (1,2) and eat the food.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo for turn 45 and 46, it's determined.\n\nTurn 45: move down to (1,3)\n\nTurn 46: move down to (1,2) and eat food.\n\nNow, after that, head at (1,2), direction down, length 15.\n\nFood at (1,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nRemaining food: (3,2) life span 5 at turn 45, after turns 45 and 46, life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 46, after eating, let's track life spans.\n\nTurn 45: food (1,2) life 2, (3,2) life 5, (5,5) life 8\n\nAfter turn 45: (1,2) life decreases to 1, still there; (3,2) life to 4; (5,5) life to 7\n\nThen on turn 46, I eat (1,2), so it's gone.\n\nAfter turn 46: (3,2) life decreases to 3 (since after turn 46); similarly (5,5) to 6.\n\nNow, at turn 46 end, head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nNow turn 47: head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,1), right to (2,2), left wall, up to (1,3) invalid instant reverse.\n\n(1,1) and (2,2) should be free.\n\n(1,1): x=1,y=1, not wall, not occupied? After eating, snake positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — tail at (6,5).\n\nSo (1,1) not occupied, free.\n\n(2,2) not in positions, should be free.\n\nAlso, no obstacle at (2,2).\n\nSo I can move down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\nNow, I need to think about getting other food.\n\nFood at (3,2) and (5,5).\n\n(3,2) is at x=3,y=2, which is below and right.\n\nFrom (1,2), moving right to (2,2) gets me closer to (3,2).\n\nMoving down to (1,1) might be a dead end or something.\n\nAlso, tail at (6,5), not adjacent.\n\nNow, I should consider the life spans.\n\n(3,2) has life span, at turn 47, after decreases: at start of turn 47, (3,2) life span: since after turn 46 it decreased to 3, so available for 3 more turns? Life span at turn 47: after previous decrease.\n\nAfter turn 46, life span of (3,2) is 3 (from 4 to 3 after turn 46? Let's track:\n\n- Turn 45: (3,2) life span 5\n\n- After turn 45: decreases to 4 (available)\n\n- Turn 46: still 4? No, after each turn, at the end of the turn, life span decreases.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current) after the turn.\"\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nBut in terms of when it decreases.\n\nFrom the example: for (1,2) at turn 45 life 2, after turn 45 it becomes 1, after turn 46 it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, the life span is L, and after the turn, it decreases to L-1.\n\nIf after decrease L=0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (3,2):\n\n- Start turn 45: life 5\n\n- After turn 45: life 4\n\n- Start turn 46: life 4\n\n- After turn 46: life 3\n\n- Start turn 47: life 3\n\n- After turn 47: life 2\n\n- Start turn 48: life 2\n\n- After turn 48: life 1\n\n- Start turn 49: life 1\n\n- After turn 49: life 0, disappears\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) start turn 45 life 8, after turn 45:7, turn 46:6, turn 47:5, etc.\n\nNow back to turn 47: head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nI can move down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\nIf I move down to (1,1), then head at (1,1), direction down.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: down to (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid. Left wall, right to (2,1), or up to (1,2) but instant reverse since direction down.\n\nSo only right to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) should be free.\n\nThen after that, I can go to (3,1) but (3,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (3,1), so cannot go there.\n\nFrom (1,1), move right to (2,1), then from (2,1), direction right (since moved right), then possible moves: up to (2,2), down to (2,0) wall, left to (1,1), instant reverse invalid, right to (3,1) but obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only up to (2,2).\n\nThen to (2,2), and so on.\n\nBut this might be inefficient.\n\nBetter to go directly to (3,2) from (1,2) via (2,2).\n\nSo on turn 47, move right to (2,2).\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction right (since I moved right from (1,2)).\n\nNow, food at (3,2) is adjacent right.\n\nOn turn 48, I can move right to (3,2) to eat it.\n\nBut is (3,2) free? Currently, no snake there, and not wall.\n\nBut let's see the snake positions after turn 47.\n\nAfter turn 46: snake at (1,2), (1,3), ..., (6,5)\n\nOn turn 47, I move right to (2,2) without eating, so no food, so move: new head at (2,2), tail removed, so positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — and (6,5) removed? Previous tail (6,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] — 15 segments? Original 15, after move no eat, length 14? After turn 46, length 15.\n\nAfter eating at turn 46, length 15.\n\nOn turn 47, move to (2,2) no eat, so new head at (2,2), previous positions except tail removed.\n\nPrevious: head (1,2), body (1,3) to (6,5)\n\nAfter move: new head (2,2), then body: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — and (6,5) removed. So 14 segments, tail at (6,4).\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nOn turn 48, head at (2,2), direction right.\n\nMove right to (3,2) to eat the food.\n\nBut (3,2) has value 1, positive.\n\nAfter eating, length increases to 15.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Tail is at (6,4), head at (2,2), not adjacent.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,2), direction right.\n\nThen I can consider moving to other areas.\n\nThere is food at (5,5).\n\nBut now, the snake is around the bottom-left, need to go to (5,5) which is top-right? y=5, since y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so y=5 is high.\n\nCurrent head at (3,2) after eating.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,2), direction right.\n\nCan move right to (4,2), up to (3,3), down to (3,1) but (3,1) obstacle, invalid, or left to (2,2) instant reverse invalid.\n\nSo possible: right to (4,2) or up to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is occupied? After eating at (3,2), let's see positions.\n\nBut before that, on turn 48.\n\nI need to plan from turn 47.\n\nAt turn 47, I have choice: from (1,2) move down or right.\n\nIf I move down to (1,1), then as before, only to (2,1), then to (2,2), etc., might take more turns.\n\nMoving right directly to (2,2) is better to reach (3,2) faster.\n\n(3,2) life span: at turn 47, life 3, so I have until turn 49 to eat it.\n\nIf I go to (1,1) first, it takes extra turn.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 47: move down to (1,1)\n\nThen head at (1,1), direction down.\n\nThen turn 48: move right to (2,1) (only choice, as before)\n\nThen head at (2,1), direction right.\n\nThen turn 49: move up to (2,2) (only choice, since down wall, left invalid instant reverse, right to (3,1) obstacle invalid)\n\nThen at (2,2), then turn 50: move to (3,2) if possible.\n\nBut (3,2) life: start turn 47 life 3, after turn 47: life 2, after turn 48: life 1, after turn 49: life 0, disappears. So on turn 50, it's gone, cannot eat.\n\nTurn 49: after turn 48, life 1, start turn 49 life 1, after turn 49 life 0 disappears.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 49.\n\nIf I go to (1,1) on turn 47, then turn 48 to (2,1), turn 49 to (2,2), but on turn 49 at (2,2), I can move to (3,2) to eat, but (3,2) is still there at start of turn 49, life 1.\n\nAfter turn 49, it disappears, so I can eat on turn 49.\n\nBut from (2,2), I need to move to (3,2).\n\nIn the direct path: turn 47 move right to (2,2), turn 48 move right to (3,2) eat.\n\nSo I eat on turn 48, one turn earlier.\n\nAnd (3,2) is eaten before it expires.\n\nIn the indirect path, I eat on turn 49, still within life span.\n\nBut the direct path is faster, and I avoid going to the corner.\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,2), I can head towards (5,5).\n\nSo better to go direct.\n\nThus on turn 47, move right to (2,2).\n\nThen on turn 48, move right to (3,2) and eat.\n\nNow, after turn 48: head at (3,2), direction right, length 15? After turn 47, when I moved to (2,2) no eat, length was 14 (since from 15 after turn 46, move no eat to 14).\n\nTurn 46: after eating (1,2), length 15.\n\nTurn 47: move to (2,2) no eat, so length 14.\n\nThen turn 48: move to (3,2) and eat, so length increases to 15.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then previous head (2,2), and all body, so [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] — tail at (6,3)? Previous positions before move: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), ..., (6,4) but (6,4) was tail? After turn 47: positions [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] — tail (6,4)\n\nAfter eating at (3,2): new head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (6,4), so positions: [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] — 16 segments, tail at (6,4).\n\nNow, head at (3,2), direction right.\n\nNow turn 49: possible moves from (3,2): right to (4,2), up to (3,3), down invalid (obstacle), left invalid instant reverse.\n\n(4,2) and (3,3) are both possible? (4,2) should be free, (3,3) is occupied? In the positions, (3,3) is body segment, index 11 in the list above.\n\nIn new positions: index 0: (3,2) head, index 1: (2,2), index 2: (1,2), ..., index 11: (3,3)? Positions: ... (2,3) at index 10, (3,3) at index 11, yes.\n\nSo (3,3) is body, not tail.\n\nMoving to (3,3) would cause collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move up to (3,3), only possible move is right to (4,2).\n\nSo move to (4,2).\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction right.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) is at x=5,y=5.\n\nI need to go there, but there are obstacles and the snake body.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,2), tail (6,4)\n\nThe grid has internal obstacle at (3,1), but that's below.\n\nI can move up or right, etc.\n\nFrom (4,2), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: right to (5,2), up to (4,3), down to (4,1), left to (3,2) invalid instant reverse.\n\n(4,1): y=1, not wall, but is it free? (4,1) not in snake positions, no obstacle, so free.\n\n(5,2) free? Probably.\n\n(4,3) is occupied? In positions, (4,3) is body, index 12: (4,3), yes body.\n\nSo cannot move up to (4,3).\n\nSo possible: right to (5,2) or down to (4,1).\n\nNow, (5,5) is at (5,5), so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (4,2), moving down to (4,1) might not be good, as it's a corner.\n\nMoving right to (5,2) is better.\n\nThen to (5,2), then up to (5,3), but (5,3) is body? Current positions: after moving to (4,2), let's see.\n\nFirst, on turn 49, move to (4,2) no eat, so positions update.\n\nPrevious head (3,2), move to (4,2), no food, so new head (4,2), tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions: head (3,2), body (2,2) to (6,4)\n\nAfter move: new head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — and (6,4) removed. Tail at (6,3).\n\nNow head at (4,2), direction right.\n\nTurn 50: possible moves: right to (5,2), up to (4,3), down to (4,1), left invalid.\n\n(4,3) is body, as above, index 13 in new positions? New positions: head (4,2), body: (3,2), (2,2), ..., (6,3)\n\n(4,3) is at index 13: (4,3), yes body, so cannot move up.\n\nDown to (4,1): free, probably.\n\nRight to (5,2): free.\n\nSo move right to (5,2).\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction right.\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2), possible moves: right to (6,2), up to (5,3), down to (5,1), left to (4,2) invalid instant reverse.\n\n(6,2): should be free, not wall.\n\n(5,3): is it body? Current positions: after turn 50, head (5,2), previous: head (4,2), body (3,2) to (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (5,2) no eat: new head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — and (6,3) removed? Previous tail (6,3) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] — tail at (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is tail.\n\nNow, (5,3) is tail, and I want to move up to (5,3)? But (5,3) is occupied by tail.\n\nBut I can move to tail because it will move.\n\nRule: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nSo moving to (5,3) is possible, and since it's tail, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, right to (6,2), or down to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) might be free.\n\nBut to reach (5,5), I need to go up.\n\nFood at (5,5), so moving up to (5,3) is towards it.\n\n(5,3) is tail, so if I move there, since no food, the tail moves, so I don't eat, but I occupy the cell.\n\nOn turn 51, from (5,2), move up to (5,3).\n\nSince (5,3) is tail, and I move to it, but no food there, so it's just moving, the tail moves away.\n\nAfter move: new head at (5,3), then the body: previous head (5,2), and previous body except tail is added, but since I moved to tail position, and no food, the snake moves, tail is removed.\n\nPrevious positions: head (5,2), body (4,2) to (5,3) — (5,3) is tail.\n\nMove to (5,3): since it's tail, no collision.\n\nNew head at (5,3), then the body: previous positions from index 1: (4,2), (3,2), ..., up to the segment before tail, which is (4,3)? Previous positions: index 0: (5,2), index 1: (4,2), index 2: (3,2), ..., index 15: (5,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3): new head (5,3), then body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — and (5,3) was tail, but now head is there, so the previous tail position is vacated, but in the body, the last segment is (4,3).\n\nNew positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] — tail at (4,3).\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction up (since moved up from (5,2)).\n\n(5,5) is at y=5, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: up to (5,4), down to (5,2) but (5,2) is now body, and moving down is instant reverse? Direction is up, opposite is down, so cannot move down.\n\nLeft to (4,3), right to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is tail, but let's see.\n\n(4,3) is tail, so I can move to it if I want.\n\nBut (5,4) and (6,3) possible.\n\n(5,4): should be free? Not in positions.\n\n(6,3): not in positions, but earlier it was, but after moves, should be free now.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), etc., no (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nSo both free.\n\nMove up to (5,4) or right to (6,3) or left to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is tail, so I can move to it.\n\nTo reach (5,5), moving up is direct.\n\nSo move up to (5,4).\n\nThen to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 51, (5,5) life span started at 8 turn 45.\n\nAfter turn 45:7, 46:6, 47:5, 48:4, 49:3, 50:2, 51:1? Start turn 51: after turn 50, life span decreases.\n\nTurn 45: start life 8\n\nAfter turn 45:7\n\nStart turn 46:7\n\nAfter turn 46:6\n\n...\n\nStart turn 51: life? After turn 50: life span decreases to, let's calculate.\n\nStart turn 45: 8\n\nAfter turn 45: 7\n\nStart turn 46: 7\n\nAfter turn 46: 6\n\nStart turn 47: 6\n\nAfter turn 47: 5\n\nStart turn 48: 5\n\nAfter turn 48: 4\n\nStart turn 49: 4\n\nAfter turn 49: 3\n\nStart turn 50: 3\n\nAfter turn 50: 2\n\nStart turn 51: 2\n\nAfter turn 51: 1\n\nStart turn 52: 1\n\nAfter turn 52: 0, disappears\n\nSo on turn 51, life span 2, so I have time.\n\nOn turn 51, from (5,2) I moved to (5,3), but that was turn 51.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nTurn 45: move down to (1,3)\n\nTurn 46: move down to (1,2) eat\n\nTurn 47: move right to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: move right to (3,2) eat\n\nTurn 49: move right to (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: move right to (5,2)\n\nNow turn 51: at (5,2), move up to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction up.\n\nTurn 52: from (5,3), move up to (5,4)\n\nNo food there, so move, new head (5,4), tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nAfter move: new head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — and (4,3) was tail? Previous tail (4,3) removed? Previous positions before move: after turn 51, positions [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (5,4) no eat: new head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) — and (4,3) removed. Tail at (3,3).\n\nNow head at (5,4), direction up.\n\nTurn 53: move up to (5,5) to eat the food.\n\n(5,5) is food, positive.\n\nAfter eating, length increases.\n\nNo danger.\n\nBut I need to think about survival after that.\n\nSince the question is to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but in answer format, it should be a sequence of actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe state is turn t1=45, and I need to output actions for turn 45, 46, etc.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since food life spans are short, I can plan until I eat or something.\n\nBut for now, from above, for turn 45 and 46, fixed.\n\nTurn 47: I have choice, but I decided to move right.\n\nSimilarly, later turns.\n\nBut to be complete, let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 45: move down (only choice)\n\nTurn 46: move down (only choice) and eat\n\nTurn 47: from (1,2), move right to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 48: move right to (3,2) and eat\n\nTurn 49: from (3,2), move right to (4,2) (only choice)\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2), move right to (5,2)\n\nNow turn 51: from (5,2), I can move up to (5,3) or other, but I chose up to (5,3)\n\nBut on turn 51, at (5,2), I could move down to (5,1) or right to (6,2), but moving up is better for (5,5).\n\n(6,2) is free, but (5,5) is up.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (5,1) might lead to dead end.\n\nSo move up to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 52: move up to (5,4)\n\nTurn 53: move up to (5,5) and eat.\n\nBut (5,5) life span at turn 53: start turn 53, after decreases.\n\nEarlier: start turn 51: life 2 (after turn 50:2)\n\nAfter turn 51:1\n\nStart turn 52:1\n\nAfter turn 52:0, disappears? After turn 52: life decreases to 0, so disappears before turn 53?\n\nStart turn 51: life 2\n\nAfter turn 51: life 1 (still there)\n\nStart turn 52: life 1\n\nAfter turn 52: life 0, disappears\n\nSo on turn 52, at start, life 1, I can eat it.\n\nOn turn 52, I am at (5,4), I can move to (5,5) to eat.\n\nIn turn 52, from (5,4), move up to (5,5) to eat.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 51: at (5,2) move to (5,3)\n\nTurn 52: at (5,3) move to (5,4)\n\nBut on turn 52, I should move directly to (5,5) if possible, but from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or to (5,5) directly? No, adjacent moves only.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 52, I move to (5,4), not to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 53 to (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 52, after turn 52, (5,5) disappears if not eaten.\n\nStart turn 52: life 1, if I don't eat on turn 52, after turn 52, life decreases to 0 and disappears, so I miss it.\n\nProblem.\n\nOn turn 52, if I am at (5,4), I can move to (5,5) to eat.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 52 I am at (5,3)? Let's see turn numbers.\n\nTurn 50: at (5,2) after move\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2) move to (5,3)  // now at (5,3)\n\nTurn 52: from (5,3) move to (5,4)  // but (5,5) must be eaten on turn 52 or before.\n\nOn turn 52, at (5,3), I should move to (5,4) only if I can reach (5,5) next, but on turn 52, I need to eat (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move up to (5,4), but not directly to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is two steps away? (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 52, if I move to (5,4), I don't eat (5,5), and after turn 52, it disappears.\n\nSo I need to be at (5,5) on turn 52 to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 52, I am at (5,3), so I can only reach (5,4) or other, not (5,5).\n\nSo I miss the food.\n\nMistake in planning.\n\nNeed to reach (5,5) by turn 52.\n\nTurn 51: at (5,2), I need to go directly towards (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move up to (5,3), but that takes two more turns.\n\nMove right to (6,2), then up, but (6,3) or something.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so from (5,2), moving up to (5,3) on turn 51, then on turn 52 to (5,4), but I need to be at (5,5) on turn 52.\n\nImpossible from there.\n\nOn turn 51, I am at (5,2), (5,5) is at same x, y+3, so I need to move up three times: turn 51 to (5,3), turn 52 to (5,4), turn 53 to (5,5), but on turn 53, (5,5) is gone.\n\nAfter turn 52, it disappears, so last chance turn 52.\n\nBut on turn 52, from (5,3), I can only go to (5,4), not to (5,5).\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,5) if I go this way.\n\nI need to be closer earlier.\n\nFor example, on turn 50, I am at (4,2), I moved to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nOn turn 50, from (4,2), I could move down to (4,1) or right to (5,2).\n\nBut moving down might not help.\n\nTo reach (5,5) faster, from (4,2) on turn 50, move right to (5,2) as before.\n\nBut then stuck.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 50, I could move up, but earlier I couldn't because (4,3) was body.\n\nOn turn 50, at (4,2), direction right.\n\nMove up to (4,3) but it was body, but at that time, after turn 49, positions.\n\nAfter turn 49: head at (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), ..., (5,3) tail? Let's recall.\n\nAfter turn 48: ate at (3,2), positions [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] tail (6,4)\n\nTurn 49: move to (4,2) no eat, so new head (4,2), tail removed, positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] tail (5,3)  // (6,4) removed\n\n(4,3) is at index 13: (4,3), body.\n\nOn turn 50, from (4,2), move to (5,2) or down to (4,1).\n\n(4,3) is body, so cannot move up.\n\nSo no way to go up from (4,2) directly.\n\nThe only way to reach (5,5) in time is to be at (5,4) on turn 51 or something, but let's see the life.\n\n(5,5) must be eaten by turn 52.\n\nStart turn 52: life 1, if eaten on turn 52, before decrease.\n\nAfter turn 52 it disappears, but on turn 52 I can eat it if I move there.\n\nSo I need to be at (5,4) or (6,5) or (4,5) or (5,6) on turn 51, then move to (5,5) on turn 52.\n\n(5,4) or adjacent cells.\n\nBut on turn 51, I am at (5,2) or (5,3) depending.\n\nOn turn 50, I am at (4,2) or (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 50, if I move up to (5,3) on turn 50? On turn 50, from (4,2), I moved to (5,2), but I could have moved down to (4,1), but that doesn't help.\n\nOn turn 50, at (4,2), only moves are to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\nMoving to (4,1) is worse.\n\nSo on turn 50, move to (5,2).\n\nThen on turn 51, at (5,2), I can move up to (5,3), but then on turn 51 I am at (5,3), then turn 52 to (5,4), not (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 51, I can move right to (6,2), then on turn 52 to (6,3) or (6,1) or (5,2) invalid, but not to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is not adjacent from there.\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,5) by turn 52 from this path.\n\nTherefore, I missed the opportunity to eat (5,5) because I took too long in the bottom.\n\nAlternative: on turn 47, from (1,2), instead of moving right to (2,2), I could move down to (1,1), but that would make me later for (3,2), and still not reach (5,5) faster.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can go to (2,1), then (2,2), then to (3,2) on turn 49 or 50, but (3,2) life until turn 49, so I can eat it, but then to (5,5) even later.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,5) with this snake position; the food will expire.\n\nPerhaps I should not have eaten (1,2) and (3,2), but I had to, because no choice.\n\nOn turn 45 and 46, I had to eat (1,2), then on turn 47 to (2,2), turn 48 to (3,2) eat, etc.\n\nMaybe from (3,2) after eating, on turn 49, I could go up or something, but I couldn't because (3,3) was occupied.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (5,5) in time.\n\n(5,5) life span 8 at turn 45, so I have 8 turns to eat it, from turn 45 to 52.\n\nBut the snake is at (1,4) on turn 45, (5,5) is at (5,5), distance |5-1| + |5-4| = 4+1=5 cells, so at least 5 moves, but with the body, it might take more.\n\nTurn 45: at (1,4)\n\nTurn 46: to (1,2) after move, but (1,2) is at same x, y=2, so from (1,4) to (1,2) in two moves down.\n\nThen turn 47: to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: to (3,2)\n\nNow at (3,2), to (5,5), |5-3| + |5-2| = 2+3=5 cells, need 5 moves, but from turn 48 to turn 52 is 4 turns (48,49,50,51,52), so on turn 52 I can be there.\n\nTurn 48: at (3,2)\n\nTurn 49: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 52: to (5,4)  -- but (5,5) is not eaten.\n\nTo reach (5,5) on turn 52, I need to be at (5,4) on turn 51.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 48, to (5,4) in 4 moves? (3,2) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4) in 4 moves, turn 49 to (4,2), turn 50 to (5,2), turn 51 to (5,3), turn 52 to (5,4), not (5,5).\n\n(3,2) to (4,2) to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, to (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) on turn 53, too late.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 48, move right to (4,2) turn 49, then on turn 50, if I could move up, but from (4,2) on turn 50, I cannot move up to (4,3) because it's body.\n\nThe only way is to go around, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) move down to (4,1) on turn 50, then to (4,0) wall, invalid, or to (5,1) on turn 51, then to (5,2) on turn 52, worse.\n\nSo it's not possible to eat (5,5) with the current path; I have to accept that I miss it or find a way to be faster.\n\nBut since I have to prioritize survival, I can focus on not dying.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can move to other areas.\n\nBut for now, in the actions, I should output the sequence I have.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 53 or so.\n\nSince (5,5) can't be eaten, I can ignore it and just move safely.\n\nBut let's list the actions from turn 45.\n\nTurn 45: move D (down)\n\nTurn 46: move D (down) eat at (1,2)\n\nTurn 47: move R (right) to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: move R (right) to (3,2) eat\n\nTurn 49: move R (right) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: move R (right) to (5,2)\n\nNow on turn 51, at (5,2), direction right.\n\nMove U (up) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 52: at (5,3), move U (up) to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 53: at (5,4), move U to (5,5) but no food, or to other.\n\nBut (5,5) gone, so move to (5,5) or other.\n\nBut to continue, I can move to (5,5) if free, but no food.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut for the answer, I think outputting a sequence is fine.\n\nThe food at (5,5) will expire, so I don't eat it.\n\nIn the initial plan, I have to move down on 45 and 46.\n\nThen on 47, I moved right.\n\nBut on turn 47, from (1,2), I could move down to (1,1), but that doesn't help.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D\n\nTurn 47: R\n\nTurn 48: R\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nBut for the box, I need to put in the format.\n\nSince the snake is long, I need to avoid self-collision.\n\nIn this path, it should be ok.\n\nAfter turn 52, at (5,4), I can move to (5,5) or (6,4) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify further.\n\nPerhaps output 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state is turn 45, so from 45 to 50 or 52.\n\nI think for the answer, I can output from turn 45 to turn 50, for example.\n\nLet's see the core rules: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but for output, it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\" so I need to specify a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output the necessary moves.\n\nSince on turn 51 and 52 I have moves, but for the food, it's gone.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: D\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: R\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: R\nTurn 50: R\n}\n\nBut on turn 50, at (5,2), and I need to think ahead.\n\nPerhaps include up to where I have.\n\nSince after turn 50, I can go up.\n\nBut I think this is fine.\n\nTo maximize score, I ate two food, missed one, but it's ok.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 45):**\n- **Snake Position:** Head at (1,4), body segments at (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Tail at (6,6).\n- **Head Direction:** Down (D).\n- **Food:**\n  - (1,2): Value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 46).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 49).\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 52).\n- **Walls:** Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n- **Grid Size:** Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (7x7 grid with borders).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Turn 45 Movement Options from (1,4):** \n  - Current direction is down (D). Cannot move up (U) due to instant reverse.\n  - Left to (0,4): Wall, invalid.\n  - Right to (2,4): Occupied by body (not tail), collision risk.\n  - Down to (1,3): Free (not wall, obstacle, or body).\n  - **Only valid move: Down (D) to (1,3).**\n\n- **Turn 46 Movement from (1,3):**\n  - After moving down, head at (1,3), direction down.\n  - Food (1,2) available (life span 1 after turn 45).\n  - Down to (1,2): Free, can eat food.\n  - Right to (2,3): Occupied by body, collision.\n  - Left/Up: Invalid (wall or instant reverse).\n  - **Only valid move: Down (D) to (1,2) to eat food.**\n\n**Long-Term Planning (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Goal:** Maximize score by eating positive food ( (3,2) and (5,5) ) while prioritizing survival. (1,2) must be eaten on turn 46.\n- **Challenges:**\n  - **Food (3,2):** Must be eaten by turn 49. Path: From (1,2) after turn 46, move right to (2,2) on turn 47, then right to (3,2) on turn 48 to eat.\n  - **Food (5,5):** Must be eaten by turn 52. However, snake is at (3,2) after turn 48, and (5,5) is 5 cells away (|5-3| + |5-2| = 5 moves). With turns 49-52 available:\n    - Turn 49: (3,2) → (4,2)\n    - Turn 50: (4,2) → (5,2)\n    - Turn 51: (5,2) → (5,3)\n    - Turn 52: (5,3) → (5,4) — but (5,5) not reached until turn 53 (too late, disappears after turn 52).\n    - **Conclusion:** (5,5) cannot be reached in time due to body obstacles and distance. Focus on survival and eating (3,2).\n  - **Survival Priority:** Avoid dead ends (e.g., bottom-left corner) and body collisions. After eating (3,2), move right to open areas.\n- **Path Safety:**\n  - After eating (3,2) on turn 48, head at (3,2), direction right. Only valid move is right to (4,2) on turn 49 (up to (3,3) is body collision, down to (3,1) is obstacle).\n  - Continue to (5,2) by turn 50, then move up to avoid corners.\n  - No tail reward danger (tail distant during food consumption).\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 45-50):**\n- **Turn 45:** Move down (D) to (1,3) — only valid move.\n- **Turn 46:** Move down (D) to (1,2) — eat (1,2), only valid move.\n- **Turn 47:** Move right (R) to (2,2) — optimal path toward (3,2), avoiding dead end at (1,1).\n- **Turn 48:** Move right (R) to (3,2) — eat (3,2), only valid move.\n- **Turn 49:** Move right (R) to (4,2) — only valid move (up/down blocked).\n- **Turn 50:** Move right (R) to (5,2) — continue toward open area, preparing for future moves (e.g., up to (5,3) on turn 51).\n\nThis sequence eats two positive foods (+2 score) and ensures survival for at least 5 turns. (5,5) is unattainable, so it is ignored to avoid unnecessary risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: D \\\\\nTurn 46: D \\\\\nTurn 47: R \\\\\nTurn 48: R \\\\\nTurn 49: R \\\\\nTurn 50: R\n}",

Let me confirm.\n\nWalls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So playable cells are from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (3,1) which is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: Head is at (1,3), and it's moving down (direction D). The positions are: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nLet me list these out to understand the shape:\n\n- Head: (1,3)\n\n- Then (1,4) — since head is at (1,3) and moving down, but (1,4) is above? No: positions are listed head first, so (1,3) is head, then (1,4), which is north of head? y increases up or down? I need to know the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The walls are given with y=0 and y=7, and snake head direction is D (down). Current head is at (1,3), and previous position must be (1,4) since it's moving down? Positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), ...]\n\n(1,3) to (1,4): if y increases upwards, then (1,4) is north of (1,3), so moving from (1,4) to (1,3) would be down. Yes, direction is D, so from (1,4) to (1,3) is down. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I think. Head at (1,3), moving down to lower y.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), then (1,4) which is above (higher y), then (1,5), (1,6) — so (1,6) is top, since y=7 is wall. y=6 is just below y=7.\n\nThen (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo the snake is like: from (1,3) down to? (1,3) is head, moving down, but next segment is (1,4), which is above, so the body goes up to (1,6), then right to (2,6), then down to (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), then right to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5).\n\nTail is at (6,5).\n\nLength of snake: 14 segments.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (3,2) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (5,5) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (1,2), life span 1, meaning it disappears after 1 turn, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 46, life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. After turn 46, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 4, so disappears after 4 more turns, including turn 46? Let's read: \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor a food with life_span L on turn T, it will disappear at the end of turn T + L - 1? Or after T + L turns? I need to clarify.\n\nSuppose on turn T, a food has life_span L. After T, it has L-1 left, and so on. After L-1 turns, on turn T + L - 1, it has 1 left, and after that turn, it disappears. So it can be eaten up to and including turn T + L - 1.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo for food at turn T with life_span N, on turn T, countdown is N. After turn T, countdown becomes N-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns where countdown >=1.\n\nFor (1,2) at turn 46, life_span 1, so countdown=1, it can be eaten on turn 46, but after turn 46, it disappears, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life_span 4, so on turn 46, countdown=4, can be eaten until turn 49 (since after 4 decreases: turn 46:4, 47:3, 48:2, 49:1, then disappears after turn 49).\n\nTurn 49: countdown=1, can be eaten on turn 49, then disappears.\n\n(5,5) life_span 7, so from turn 46 to 52 inclusive.\n\n(4,6) life_span 10, turns 46 to 55 inclusive.\n\nNow, head is at (1,3), direction down. So possible moves: from (1,3) moving down, to (1,2)? But (1,2) has food, and also, is it a wall? Walls are x=0/x=7, y=0/y=7, so (1,2) is within 1-6, y=2>0, so not wall. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1), not here.\n\nBut snake body: is (1,2) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo (1,2) is not occupied by snake, and no wall, so moving down to (1,2) is possible.\n\nBut there's food at (1,2). If I move down to (1,2), I eat the food.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nAlso, direction: I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up to (1,4), which is the body anyway.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,3), moving down, so I can move down to (1,2), left to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, so cannot, right to (2,3)? (2,3) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (2,3) is in the list, index 7? Positions: index 0: head (1,3), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (1,6), 4: (2,6), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,3), 8: (3,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) is occupied by the body, so moving right to (2,3) would be collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, up to (1,4) is also body, and opposite direction? Current direction down, up is opposite, so cannot move up anyway.\n\nSo possible actions:\n\n- Down to (1,2): not wall, not body? (1,2) not in snake positions, so yes.\n\n- Left to (0,2): x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Right to (2,3): occupied by snake at (2,3), so collision.\n\n- Up: to (1,4), occupied by snake and opposite direction, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) has food with value +1, life span 1, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nFirst, is head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (6,5). Head at (1,3), which is not adjacent; (1,3) to (6,5) is far away. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\nHead (1,3), neighbors: (1,2), (1,4), (0,3), (2,3). None of these is (6,5), so not adjacent to tail. So no issue.\n\nAlso, the food is at (1,2), not on tail. Tail is at (6,5), no food there.\n\nSo moving to (1,2) seems safe and I get the food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so new tail position: when I eat, I grow, so after moving to (1,2), head is at (1,2), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes: new head (1,2), then previous head (1,3) becomes segment, and so on, up to tail (6,5), but since I ate, tail stays, so positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] — 15 segments.\n\nBut turn 46: I move to (1,2), eat food.\n\nNow, for future turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut the food at (1,2) has life span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears, and I miss it.\n\nSince it's the only move, I have to go down to (1,2).\n\nIs there any other move? Earlier I thought only down is possible, but let's confirm.\n\nCurrent position: (1,3)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (1,4) — occupied by snake body, and also opposite to current direction (current down, up opposite), so invalid.\n\n- D: (1,2) — not occupied, not wall, has food.\n\n- L: (0,2) — x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R: (2,3) — occupied by snake at (2,3), invalid.\n\nSo indeed, only down to (1,2) is possible.\n\nSo for turn 46, I must move down to (1,2) and eat the food.\n\nThen, after that, head is at (1,2), direction down? I moved down, so new direction is down.\n\nNow, for turn 47, head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,1)? y=1, not wall (y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable), but (1,1) is it occupied? Snake positions after move: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), etc. (1,1) not occupied, no wall except borders, internal obstacle at (3,1), not (1,1).\n\n(1,1) should be free.\n\nLeft to (0,2) wall.\n\nRight to (2,2)? (2,2) is it occupied? Current snake: after moving to (1,2) and eating, positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nSo (2,2) is not occupied, and not wall.\n\nUp to (1,3) — but (1,3) is the body, occupied, and also if I move up, opposite to current direction? Current direction is down (since I just moved down), so moving up would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves from (1,2):\n\n- D: to (1,1) — not occupied, not wall\n\n- L: to (0,2) wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (2,2) — not occupied\n\n- U: to (1,3) occupied and opposite, invalid\n\nSo I can move down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\nNow, I need to think about future food and survival.\n\nAvailable food:\n\n- (3,2) value 1, life span 4, countdown 4 on turn 46, but after turn 46, on turn 47, countdown 3, etc.\n\n- (5,5) value 1, life span 7, on turn 47 countdown 6\n\n- (4,6) value 1, life span 10, on turn 47 countdown 9\n\n(1,2) was eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, head at (1,2), I can go to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nIf I go down to (1,1), that's the bottom row, y=1, above y=0 wall.\n\nThen from there, I can move left or right, but not up (opposite? if I moved down to (1,1), direction down, then from (1,1), moving down to (1,0) is wall, invalid; left to (0,1) wall; right to (2,1); up to (1,2) which is body.\n\n(2,1) might be free, but let's see.\n\nIf I go right to (2,2) from (1,2), then I'm at (2,2), direction right? Since I moved right.\n\nThen from there, I can go up, down, right, but not left (opposite).\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the snake body is long, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nMoreover, there's food at (3,2), which is close.\n\n(3,2) is at x=3,y=2.\n\nCurrently head at (1,2), so (3,2) is two steps right, but I have to go through (2,2).\n\nIf I move right to (2,2) on turn 47, then on turn 48, from (2,2), I can move right to (3,2) to eat the food.\n\nBut is (3,2) safe to eat? Let's see.\n\nFirst, on turn 47, from (1,2), if I move right to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction right.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), ... up to tail (6,5). Since I didn't eat, tail moves? On turn 46 I ate, so tail stayed. Now on turn 47, if I don't eat, tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 46: I moved to (1,2) and ate, so snake grew to 15 segments: positions as above.\n\nOn turn 47, I move to a new position.\n\nIf I move to (2,2), which has no food, so no eat, so tail moves: the tail was at (6,5), and since the snake moves, the last segment is removed.\n\nSo after moving to (2,2), head at (2,2), then the previous head (1,2) becomes segment, and tail (6,5) is removed, so new positions: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] — tail now at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) was previously second last, now last.\n\nAnd (6,5) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved down to (1,1), similar thing.\n\nBut back to the plan.\n\nIf on turn 47 I move right to (2,2), then on turn 48, from (2,2), direction right, I can move right to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, value 1.\n\nIs it safe? (3,2) is not occupied by snake? Current positions after turn 47: head (2,2), body: (1,2), (1,3), etc. (3,2) not in list, and not wall.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,1), not (3,2).\n\nSo moving to (3,2) should be fine, eat the food.\n\nBut life span: (3,2) life span 4 on turn 46, turn 47 countdown 3, turn 48 countdown 2, so can be eaten on turn 48.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, tail stays.\n\nBut now, head at (3,2), after moving from (2,2) to (3,2), direction right.\n\nThen what? I need to go somewhere.\n\nThere is food at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the bottom and right.\n\nAfter eating at (3,2), positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to tail, but since ate, tail doesn't move, so positions include (6,4) as tail? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 47: if I moved to (2,2) without eating, positions: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] tail at (6,4)\n\nThen turn 48: move to (3,2) and eat, so new head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), etc., and tail (6,4) stays, so snake has 16 segments now.\n\nBut (3,2) is at y=2, and the body is at (3,3), which is below.\n\nFrom (3,2), I need to move. Possible directions: since I moved right to (3,2), direction right.\n\nCan move up, down, right, not left (opposite).\n\nUp to (3,3)? (3,3) is occupied by snake body? Positions: after eating, head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\n(3,3) is in the body, so moving up to (3,3) would be collision.\n\nDown to (3,1)? But (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nRight to (4,2)? (4,2) is it free? Not occupied, not wall, I think.\n\n(4,2) should be free.\n\nLeft: cannot, opposite.\n\nSo from (3,2), only possible move is right to (4,2), since up and down are invalid.\n\nDown to (3,1) is wall, up to (3,3) is body, left to (2,2) is body and opposite, right to (4,2) should be free.\n\n(4,2) not in positions, not wall.\n\nSo I must move right to (4,2) on turn 48 after eating at (3,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (5,2), (4,1), (4,3), etc., but (4,3) is body? Positions after moving to (4,2): since I moved to (4,2) without eating (no food there), so tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 48: ate at (3,2), so positions with growth: head (3,2), body (2,2), (1,2), ..., (6,4), 16 segments.\n\nThen turn 49: move to (4,2), no food, so head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), etc., and tail moves, so remove (6,4), new tail is (6,3)? Previous positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (6,3), (6,4) — tail (6,4).\n\nAfter move to (4,2) no eat, head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — tail at (6,3), since (6,4) removed.\n\n(6,4) was tail, removed, so tail is now (6,3).\n\nAnd (6,4) free.\n\nNow head at (4,2), direction right (since moved right from (3,2)).\n\nPossible moves: right to (5,2), down to (4,1)? (4,1) is above y=0? y=1, not wall, but (4,1) free? Not occupied.\n\nUp to (4,3) — (4,3) is occupied by snake? Positions: (4,3) is in the list, body segment.\n\nLeft to (3,2) — occupied and opposite direction.\n\nSo can move right to (5,2) or down to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is not wall, and not occupied.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,1), but (4,1) should be free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,5) food, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the other option at turn 47.\n\nAt turn 47, from (1,2), I could have moved down to (1,1) instead of right to (2,2).\n\nIf I move down to (1,1) on turn 47.\n\nThen head at (1,1), direction down (since moved down).\n\nSnake positions: after move, no eat (assuming no food at (1,1)), so head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), ..., and tail moves, remove (6,4), new positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] tail at (6,3).\n\n(6,4) was tail, removed.\n\nNow from (1,1), I can move: down to (1,0) wall, invalid; left to (0,1) wall; right to (2,1); up to (1,2) occupied and opposite direction? Current direction down, up is opposite, so cannot move up.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) should be free.\n\nThen on turn 48, from (1,1) move to (2,1), head at (2,1), direction right (since moved right).\n\nThen from (2,1), can move up to (2,2), right to (3,1), but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid; down to (2,0) wall; left to (1,1) occupied and opposite.\n\nSo only move up to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) should be free.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (2,1) move to (2,2), head at (2,2), direction up (since moved up from (2,1)).\n\nThen I can go to (3,2) to eat food, etc.\n\nBut the food at (3,2) has countdown, on turn 47: after turn 46, countdown for (3,2) is 3 (since turn 46:4, turn 47:3), turn 48:2, turn 49:1, then disappears.\n\nSo on turn 49, if I can reach (3,2), I can eat it.\n\nIn this path: on turn 47: move to (2,1) from (1,1)? Turn 47: from (1,2) move down to (1,1), no eat.\n\nTurn 48: from (1,1) move right to (2,1), no eat.\n\nTurn 49: from (2,1) move up to (2,2), no eat.\n\nThen on turn 50, from (2,2) I can move right to (3,2) to eat, but on turn 50, (3,2) countdown: turn 46:4, 47:3, 48:2, 49:1, so after turn 49, it disappears, so on turn 50, it's gone. So I miss the food.\n\nIn the first path, if I go directly to (2,2) on turn 47, then turn 48 to (3,2), I eat on turn 48 with countdown 2.\n\nIf I go down to (1,1) first, I only reach (2,2) on turn 49, and (3,2) is gone by turn 50, so I can't eat it.\n\nTherefore, it's better to go right to (2,2) on turn 47 to get the (3,2) food.\n\nMoreover, going to (1,1) might be riskier, as I'm near the border.\n\nSo for turn 47, moving right to (2,2) is better.\n\nThen, as before, on turn 48 to (3,2) eat.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (3,2) move right to (4,2), as only option.\n\nThen from (4,2), as before, I can move right to (5,2) or down to (4,1).\n\nNow, food at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, (4,6) at x=4,y=6.\n\nAfter turn 49, head at (4,2), after moving from (3,2) to (4,2) on turn 49? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 46: move down to (1,2) eat, head at (1,2)\n\nTurn 47: move right to (2,2) no eat, head at (2,2), tail moved, positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), ..., (6,3) tail? Earlier: after turn 47 move to (2,2) no eat, head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — tail at (6,3)\n\n(6,4) was removed.\n\nTurn 48: move to (3,2) and eat, head at (3,2), new positions with growth: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — tail (6,4)? When I eat, tail doesn't move, so the last segment before move was tail (6,3), but since I ate, it stays, so positions: after moving to (3,2) and eat, head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), ..., (6,3), and tail remains, so (6,3) is still there, but I added a new segment? When snake eats, it grows, so the segment that would be removed is not removed, so the tail stays put.\n\nBefore turn 48 move, positions: head (2,2), body (1,2) to (6,3) tail, 14 segments? After turn 47: 15 segments? Initial snake was 14, turn 46 ate, became 15. Turn 47 no eat, moved to (2,2), head (2,2), body (1,2) to (6,3), 14 segments? Let's count positions.\n\nAfter turn 46: positions 15: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — head (1,2), tail (6,5)\n\nTurn 47: move to (2,2), no eat, so head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — tail (6,4), 14 segments.\n\n(6,5) removed.\n\nTurn 48: move to (3,2) and eat (3,2), so head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — and since ate, tail (6,4) stays, 15 segments.\n\nTurn 49: from (3,2) move to (4,2), no food there, so head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (6,3), and tail moves, remove (6,4), new positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — tail (6,3), 14 segments.\n\n(6,4) removed.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: right to (5,2), down to (4,1), up to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied (body), left to (3,2) occupied and opposite.\n\nSo can move right to (5,2) or down to (4,1).\n\nNow, (4,1) is at y=1, near bottom.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\n(5,5) is up and right, (4,6) is up.\n\nI need to navigate to them.\n\nAlso, the body is at (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nIf I move down to (4,1), then I'm at bottom, might be harder to get up.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can move right to (5,1) or left to (3,1) but (3,1) obstacle, or up to (4,2) which is body after I move.\n\nBut let's see later.\n\nIf I move right to (5,2), then I can go up to (5,3), but (5,3) is body? Current positions after turn 49: head (4,2), body (3,2) to (6,3), so (5,3) is occupied.\n\nFrom (5,2), if I move up to (5,3), collision.\n\nBut I need to reach (5,5) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at top, y=6.\n\nFrom current position (4,2), I can go to (5,2), then from (5,2), I can move down to (5,1) or right to (6,2) or up to (5,3) but occupied.\n\n(6,2) should be free? (6,2) not occupied, not wall.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go up, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (5,5).\n\n(5,5) has life span 7 on turn 46, so on turn 47:6, 48:5, 49:4, 50:3, 51:2, 52:1, disappears after.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life span 10, turn 49:7 left, etc.\n\nTo reach (5,5) from (4,2), I need to go up.\n\nBut directly up is blocked at (4,3).\n\nSo I need to go around.\n\nFor example, go right to (5,2), then to (6,2), then up to (6,3), but (6,3) is tail or body? After turn 49, positions have (6,3) as tail? Positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — (6,3) is tail.\n\nSo if I go to (6,2), then to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied now, but when I move, the tail might move.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOn turn 50, from (4,2), I move right to (5,2), no eat (no food), so head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3)? Positions: previous head (4,2), body (3,2) to (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) no eat, head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3), and (6,3) removed.\n\n(6,3) was tail, removed, so tail is (5,3).\n\nNow head at (5,2), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: right to (6,2), down to (5,1), up to (5,3) but (5,3) occupied, left to (4,2) occupied and opposite.\n\nSo can move right to (6,2) or down to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is bottom, (6,2) is right.\n\nIf I move to (6,2), then on turn 51, from (6,2), I can move up to (6,3) or down to (6,1), etc.\n\n(6,3) is now free, since tail moved.\n\nAfter turn 50, (6,3) is free.\n\nFrom (6,2), move up to (6,3), no eat probably.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move up to (6,4), which is free, or left to (5,3), but (5,3) is body? Current positions after turn 50: head (5,2), body (4,2) to (5,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) is tail.\n\nIf I move to (6,3) on turn 51, no eat, head (6,3), then (5,2), (4,2), ..., (5,3) removed? Let's not get lost.\n\nI need to go to (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (6,4), then to (6,5), but (6,5) might be free.\n\n(6,5) was tail earlier, but moved.\n\nOn turn 51, from (5,2) move to (6,2), head (6,2), direction right.\n\nThen positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3)\n\nThen turn 52: from (6,2) move to (6,3), no eat, head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (4,3), (5,3) removed, new tail (4,3)? Positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,3) move to (6,4), no eat, head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), etc., tail moves.\n\nThen turn 54: to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,5), from (6,4) I can move left to (5,4), then to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) has food, and on turn 54, countdown: turn 46 life span 7, so last eat turn 52 (turn 46+6=52? Turn 46:7, 47:6, ..., 52:1, can eat on turn 52. Turn 53: gone? Turn 52 countdown 1, eaten or disappears after turn 52.\n\nTurn 46: countdown 7\n\nTurn 47:6\n\n...\n\nTurn 52:1, can be eaten on turn 52, then after turn 52, disappears.\n\nTurn 53: gone.\n\nIn my sequence, on turn 52, head is at (6,3), not at (5,5).\n\nSo I might not reach (5,5) in time if I go this way.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 49, I could move down to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 50, from (4,1), I can move right to (5,1) or up to (4,2) but occupied, etc.\n\n(5,1) free, then from (5,1) to (5,2), but (5,2) might be occupied later.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for (4,6) first, which has more time.\n\n(4,6) life span 10, turn 46:10, turn 49:7, etc., last eat turn 55.\n\nFrom current position (4,2) on turn 49, I can go to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (5,5) but (5,5) may be gone.\n\n(5,5) gone by turn 53.\n\nFrom (6,4), on turn 53, I can move left to (5,4), then to (5,5) on turn 54, but too late.\n\nTurn 52 is last chance.\n\nOn turn 50, if I am at (5,2), I could move up? But (5,3) is occupied, so I can't.\n\nUnless I go around.\n\nAnother idea: from (4,2) on turn 49, move down to (4,1), then to (5,1), then to (5,2), but (5,2) is where I would be if I moved directly, same issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to go left or something, but left is body.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nThe grid is 6x6 playable, but with obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake occupies 14 cells on turn 49.\n\nFree cells: all except walls, obstacle, and snake.\n\nWalls: borders and (3,1)\n\nSnake positions turn 49: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — 16 positions? No, after turn 49, positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — that's 16 cells? But earlier I said 14 segments.\n\nMistake.\n\nAfter turn 49: from turn 48, after eating at (3,2), positions 15: head (3,2), body (2,2) to (6,4) tail? Turn 48: after move to (3,2) and eat, positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — 16 segments? Initial 14, turn 46 ate, 15, turn 47 no eat 14, turn 48 ate, 15 segments.\n\nTurn 46: after eat, 15 segments.\n\nTurn 47: no eat, move to (2,2), head (2,2), body (1,2) to (6,4), 14 segments (since tail moved).\n\nPositions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — that's 15 positions? Indices: 0 head, 1 to 14 body, 15 positions? No: from (2,2) to (6,4), let's count: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — 15 positions, but turn 47 should be 14 after no eat? Initial turn 46: 15 segments.\n\nTurn 46: after eat, 15 segments.\n\nTurn 47: move to (2,2), no eat, so head (2,2), then the previous head (1,2) becomes first body, and tail (6,4) is removed, so positions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — 14 segments. (6,4) removed.\n\nYes, 14 positions.\n\nTurn 48: move to (3,2) and eat, so head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — and since ate, tail (6,3) stays, so 15 segments.\n\nTurn 49: move to (4,2), no food, so head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3), 14 segments.

But (5,3) is occupied.\n\n(5,3) is body.\n\nGo to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (5,5) but (5,5) gone, or to (4,5), then to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is food.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (5,5) gone, but to (4,5) or directly to (4,6) if possible.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is near the top.\n\nCurrent positions have (2,6), (1,6), etc.\n\n(4,6) is free, I think.\n\nLet's list free cells around.\n\nFrom (4,2), move right to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nThen turn 51 to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 52 to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 53 to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 54 to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 55 to (5,5) but (5,5) gone, or to (6,6) but y=6, x=6, not wall, but (6,6) may be free.\n\nThen from (6,5) to (6,6), then to (5,6), then to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) can be eaten on turn 57? Turn 55 at (6,5), turn 56 to (6,6), turn 57 to (5,6), turn 58 to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) life span 10 from turn 46, last eat turn 55 (turn 46+9=55? Turn 46:10, 47:9, ..., 55:1, can eat on turn 55.\n\nTurn 56: gone.\n\nSo on turn 55, I can be at (4,6) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 55 at (6,5), not (4,6).\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 53, I can move left to (5,4), then to (5,5) but gone, or to (4,4), then to (4,5), then to (4,6).\n\nTurn 53: at (6,4), move to (5,4) or (6,5) or (5,3) but (5,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nLet's define a path.\n\nTurn 49: head at (4,2), move to (5,2)  (let's choose this for now)\n\nTurn 50: at (5,2), move to (6,2)  (right)\n\nTurn 51: at (6,2), move to (6,3)  (up, say)\n\nTurn 52: at (6,3), move to (6,4)  (up)\n\nTurn 53: at (6,4), move to (6,5)  (up)\n\nTurn 54: at (6,5), move to (5,5) but (5,5) gone, or to (6,6) or (5,5) invalid, so to (6,6) if possible.\n\n(6,6) not wall, free.\n\nTurn 54: to (6,6)\n\nTurn 55: from (6,6) move to (5,6)\n\nTurn 56: to (4,6) but turn 56, (4,6) countdown: turn 46:10, turn 56:10-10=0?

Turn 53 at (6,4), move to (6,5)\n\nTurn 54 at (6,5)\n\nThen turn 55, from (6,5) I can move left to (5,5) gone, or up to (6,6), or down to (6,4) but occupied, etc.\n\n(5,5) gone, so to (6,6)\n\nBut (6,6) to (4,6) is two steps, can't reach in one turn.\n\nSo I cannot reach (4,6) on turn 55 from (6,5).\n\nIf on turn 53 at (6,4), I move left to (5,4) instead of to (6,5).\n\nTurn 53: at (6,4), move to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 54: at (5,4), move to (5,5) gone, or to (4,4), or to (5,3) but (5,3) may be body.\n\nAfter turn 52, positions depend.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps from (4,2) on turn 49, move down to (4,1), then to (5,1), then to (5,2), same as before.\n\nOr, another idea: since (4,3) is occupied, but the tail is at (5,3), and as I move, the tail moves, freeing space.\n\nFor example, on turn 50, from (4,2), move to (5,2), then on turn 51, from (5,2), I can move down to (5,1), then on turn 52 to (5,0) wall, not, or to (6,1), etc., not helping.\n\nI think I can't reach (5,5) in time, and (4,6) is possible but tricky.\n\nPerhaps I should have chosen a different path earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 47, from (1,2), instead of going right to (2,2), I could have gone down to (1,1), but then I miss the (3,2) food, which is bad.\n\n(3,2) is close and easy to get.\n\nSo for turn 46, I must move down to (1,2).\n\nFor turn 47, move right to (2,2) to get the (3,2) food.\n\nThen for turn 48, move to (3,2) eat.\n\nThen for turn 49, move to (4,2).\n\nNow for turn 49, from (4,2), I can move to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\nTo reach (4,6), I can go to (4,1), but that's away.\n\nGo to (5,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), etc., as before.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I move down to (4,1), then on turn 50 to (5,1), turn 51 to (5,2), turn 52 to (6,2), turn 53 to (6,3), turn 54 to (6,4), turn 55 to (6,5), turn 56 to (5,5) gone or (6,6), not (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 51, move to (5,3) but (5,3) may be free by then.\n\nOn turn 51, where is the tail?\n\nLet's simulate from turn 49.\n\nTurn 49: head at (4,2), move to (5,2)  (right, no eat)\n\nPositions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail -- 14 segments, tail (5,3)\n\nTurn 50: from (5,2) move to (6,2)  (right, no eat)\n\nHead (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) -- tail (4,3), 14 segments.

Only valid move is Down to (1,2) due to:\n  - Wall at x=0 (left invalid).\n  - Body at (1,4) (up invalid and opposite direction).\n  - Body at (2,3) (right invalid).\n- **Food at (1,2)**: Positive food with value +1 and life span 1 (disappears after this turn). Eating it is safe since:\n  - Head is not adjacent to tail (tail at (6,5), far away).\n  - No collision risk.\n- **Long-term**: Eating this food maximizes immediate reward and avoids missing it. Survival is not at risk with this move.\n\n### Plan for Turns 47-51 (5+ Turns Ahead)\n\n- **Prioritize survival and food access**: After eating (1,2), the snake grows to 15 segments. The next food at (3,2) (value +1, life span 4) can be eaten by turn 48. Other foods ( (5,5) and (4,6) ) are farther but have longer life spans; however, the body layout blocks direct paths, and they may not be reachable in time due to distance and disappearing counts. Focus on:\n  - Reaching (3,2) quickly (eaten on turn 48).\n  - Avoiding dead ends (e.g., bottom row at y=1 is riskier).\n  - Moving right/up when possible to access open areas.\n\n- **Turn 47 (head at (1,2), direction Down)**:\n  - Move Right to (2,2) to approach (3,2). Moving Down to (1,1) is possible but delays reaching (3,2) and risks missing it (life span decreases).\n\n- **Turn 48 (head at (2,2), direction Right)**:\n  - Move Right to (3,2) to eat food. This is the only valid move (up to (2,3) is body, down to (2,1) is valid but misses food, left opposite).\n\n- **Turn 49 (head at (3,2), direction Right)**:\n  - Move Right to (4,2). Only valid move (up to (3,3) is body, down to (3,1) is wall, left opposite).\n\n- **Turn 50 (head at (4,2), direction Right)**:\n  - Move Right to (5,2). Moving Down to (4,1) is valid but leads to bottom row, which may limit future moves. Moving right keeps options open for navigating upward later.\n\n- **Turn 51 (head at (5,2), direction Right)**:\n  - Move Right to (6,2). This avoids the bottom row and positions the snake to move up (e.g., to (6,3) on later turns) for better board coverage.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Food Capture**: Eats two foods ((1,2) and (3,2)) by turn 48, increasing score by +2 and length to 16.\n- **Survival**: Avoids collisions and dead ends. The path uses open spaces and leverages tail movement to free cells.\n- **Long-term**: After turn 51, the snake can move up (e.g., (6,2) to (6,3)) to access the right side, but (5,5) and (4,6) are likely unreachable before disappearing (based on life spans and distance). New food may spawn, so positioning in less confined areas is better.\n- **Risks Avoided**: No tail reward danger, no wall/body collisions. Movement constraints respected (no instant reverse).\n\n### Answer Format\nActions for turns 46 to 51 (6 turns, including current):\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: D (down)  \nTurn 47: R (right)  \nTurn 48: R (right)  \nTurn 49: R (right)  \nTurn 50: R (right)  \nTurn 51: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 47, and I'm the snake AI. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells go from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (1,2), then body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). That's 15 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\nHead: (1,2)\n\nThen: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — that's vertical down on x=1.\n\nThen: (2,6) — right to (2,6)\n\nThen: (2,5) — down? (2,6) to (2,5) is down? y decreases as we go down, I assume? Let's see coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y increases upwards, but here it might be decreasing? No, let's think.\n\nThe head direction is given as D, which is down, meaning (x,y-1). So head is at (1,2), direction down, so next would be to (1,1), but (1,1) might be within bounds? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, I think. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nHead at (1,2), direction down, so moving down decreases y.\n\nSnake positions: from head (1,2), then (1,3) — if y increases upwards, (1,3) is up from (1,2)? That might be inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the coordinate system has y increasing downwards. Let's see the sequence.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nHead at (1,2), then (1,3), which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, (1,3) is north of (1,2), but the head direction is down, which should be decreasing y. Contradiction.\n\nHead direction is D, down, meaning from current position, moving to (x,y-1). But current head is (1,2), so moving down should go to (1,1). But the next segment is (1,3), which has y=3 > y=2, so if y increases upwards, (1,3) is above (1,2), so moving up, not down.\n\nBut direction is given as down. Inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the coordinate system has y=0 at top, y increasing downwards. That makes sense because moving down increases y if y=0 is top.\n\nConfirm: if y=0 is top, then moving down increases y-coordinate.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) down to (1,3) if y increases down.\n\nYes, that must be it. Because head at (1,2), direction down, and next segment is (1,3), which is down if y increases downward.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,6) to (2,6) is right, then to (2,5) which is up? (2,6) to (2,5): if y increases down, y=5 is above y=6, so moving up.\n\nThen (2,5) to (2,4) up, (2,4) to (2,3) up, (2,3) to (3,3) right, and so on.\n\nHead direction is down, meaning the snake was moving down to reach (1,2), I think. Direction is the current movement direction.\n\nSo at turn 47, snake head is at (1,2), and it is facing down, so last move was down to (1,2). But the previous position is (1,3)? Positions list: head (1,2), then body (1,3), so the segment after head is where the head came from, so from (1,3) to (1,2) was moving down? From (1,3) to (1,2): if y increases down, (1,3) to (1,2) is moving up (decreasing y), but direction is down, which is increasing y? I'm confused.\n\nLet me define the coordinate system properly.\n\nAssume that (0,0) is top-left corner, y increases downward, x increases right.\n\nSo:\n\n- U: (x, y-1)  // up, decrease y\n\n- D: (x, y+1)  // down, increase y\n\n- L: (x-1, y)  // left, decrease x\n\n- R: (x+1, y)  // right, increase x\n\nIn the state, head direction is D, down, so (x, y+1).\n\nHead position is (1,2), so if it moves down, it would go to (1,3).\n\nBut the snake positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), etc. So (1,3) is the first body segment, meaning the head was at (1,3) before moving to (1,2)? That doesn't make sense for direction down.\n\nPerhaps the positions are listed from head to tail, so head is current position, then the next is the segment that was head one step ago, and so on to tail.\n\nSo at turn 47, head is at (1,2). The direction is D, down, meaning that to reach (1,2), the snake moved from the previous head position to (1,2) by moving down. So previous head position was (1,3), because moving down from (1,3) to (1,2)? From (1,3) to (1,2) is moving up if y increases down, because y decreases from 3 to 2.\n\nIf y increases downward, (1,3) to (1,2) is decreasing y, so up, not down.\n\nBut direction is given as D, down. Contradiction.\n\nUnless the direction is the direction the head is facing, so for the next move, it can move in that direction or adjacent, but not reverse.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nHead direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" – this is the current direction the head is facing, which determines what moves are possible without instant reverse.\n\nFor example, if current direction is D, I can move D, L, or R, but not U, because U is reverse.\n\nSimilarly, the positions: head at (1,2), and the body segments follow.\n\nThe sequence of positions shows the path: from head to tail.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) to (2,6) to (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,4) to (6,5).\n\nSo, from head (1,2) to next (1,3): that means the snake moved from (1,2) to (1,3) at some point, but currently head is at (1,2), so the body at (1,3) is where the head was one step ago.\n\nSo the move that brought the head to (1,2) was from where? If previous head was at (1,1), moving down to (1,2), but (1,1) is not in the body; the body starts at (1,3).\n\nPositions: head (1,2), then (1,3), so (1,3) is the first body segment, meaning at turn 46, head was at (1,3), and it moved to (1,2) at turn 47.\n\nMoving from (1,3) to (1,2): if y increases downward, (1,3) to (1,2) is decreasing y, so moving up (U).\n\nBut the current head direction is given as D, down. That can't be right because if it moved from (1,3) to (1,2), it moved up, so direction should be U.\n\nBut it's given as D. Perhaps I have the coordinate system wrong.\n\nAnother possibility: y=0 at bottom, y increasing upward. But walls are y=0 and y=7, with y=0 bottom or top?\n\nThe problem says: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" It doesn't specify which is top or bottom, but from the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), etc.\n\nLet's look at the movement definitions:\n\n\" U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)` \"\n\nSo U: (x, y+1) — if y+1, that means y increases as we go up? Typically in math, y increases up, but in computer graphics, y often increases down.\n\nIn this notation, U is (x,y+1), so if y+1 for up, that suggests that y increases as we go up, so (0,0) bottom-left or top-left?\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up, x increases right.\n\nThen U: (x,y+1) up\n\nD: (x,y-1) down\n\nL: (x-1,y) left\n\nR: (x+1,y) right\n\nThen for snake positions: head at (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), etc.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,3): if y increases up, (1,3) is above (1,2), so moving up.\n\nBut head direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1), so from (1,2) down would be to (1,1).\n\nBut the body has (1,3), which is above, so the move to current position: from previous head to current head.\n\nAt turn 46, head was at (1,3), moved to (1,2) at turn 47. Moving from (1,3) to (1,2): if y increases up, (1,2) has lower y, so moving down (D). Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo from (1,3) to (1,2) is down, decreasing y, so direction is D.\n\nThen the body: from (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) to (2,6) etc.\n\nFrom (1,3) to (1,4): (1,4) has higher y, so up, but in the sequence, it's body segments, so the snake was moving up before.\n\nBut current direction is down.\n\nAnyway, for our purpose, we need the current state.\n\nSo grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (1,2)\n\nBody: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nTail is at (6,5)\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,2) with value 1, life_span 3 (so disappears after 3 turns, including current, so at turn 50 it will be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 47, life_span=3, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning it exists on turns 47,48,49, gone on turn 50.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) value 1, life_span 6, so exists turns 47 to 52, gone on 53.\n\n(4,6) value 1, life_span 9, exists turns 47 to 55.\n\nAll food has value 1, positive.\n\nNow, current turn 47, head at (1,2), direction D (down), so cannot move U (up) because that would be reverse.\n\nPossible moves from (1,2): D, L, R.\n\n- D: down to (1,1)  // y decreases, since y increases up? Let's clarify coordinate.\n\nFrom above: U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), so for (1,2):\n\n- U: (1,3)  // up\n\n- D: (1,1)  // down\n\n- L: (0,2)  // left, but x=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- R: (2,2)  // right\n\nBut current direction is D, so I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n\nU is reverse, so not allowed.\n\nL: (0,2) is x=0, wall, so invalid.\n\nR: (2,2) is empty? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nFirst, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (1,1) is y=1, not wall, but y=0 is wall, so (1,1) is playable.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is wall.\n\nNow, snake occupied cells:\n\nFrom positions: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(1,1) is not occupied, and not wall except border, but y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=1 to y=6 playable.\n\nSimilarly x.\n\nSo from (1,2), possible moves:\n\n- D: to (1,1) - down, y-1. Is (1,1) free? Not occupied by snake or wall? Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) is not wall, and not in snake positions, so free.\n\n- L: to (0,2) - x=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- R: to (2,2) - is (2,2) occupied? Snake positions: (1,2), (1,3), etc., no (2,2), so free.\n\n- U: to (1,3) - but U is reverse, not allowed because current direction is D.\n\nSo possible actions: D or R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid 6x6, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells outside 1-6 are walls, and internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nTail at (6,5).\n\nFood: (3,2), (5,5), (4,6)\n\nAll value +1.\n\nLife span: (3,2) expires after turn 49, so must be eaten by turn 49.\n\n(5,5) expires after turn 52.\n\n(4,6) expires after turn 55.\n\nNow, current turn 47.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,2), D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nI need to evaluate both options with lookahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving D to (1,1).\n\nIf I move to (1,1), what happens.\n\nNew head at (1,1), direction now D (since I moved down).\n\nThen snake grows only if I eat food, but no food at (1,1), so length same, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move, head at (1,1), body: the tail will move, so the last segment (6,5) is removed, and new head added.\n\nPositions: after moving to (1,1), the new positions: head (1,1), then previous head (1,2) becomes body, so [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] and tail was (6,5), which is removed, so the segment before tail is (6,4), which is now tail? Let's list new positions.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (1,2), then body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nAfter moving down to (1,1), new head at (1,1), then the previous head (1,2) is added to body, and the tail (6,5) is removed, so new positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nNow, from (1,1), direction D (down, but y=1, down to y=0 is wall, so I can only move R or U? Direction is D, so possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nD to (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,1) - (2,1) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nU to (1,2) - but U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction after moving D is D, so from (1,1), moving D to (1,0) invalid, L to (0,1) invalid, R to (2,1) possible, U not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,1).\n\nThen to (2,1), and so on.\n\nBut (2,1) is free, but then from there, I need to think.\n\nIf I go to (1,1), then I must go to (2,1) next, since only choice.\n\nFrom (2,1), direction would be R (since I moved right from (1,1)).\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but not reverse, so since moved R, cannot move L.\n\nDirection after move to (2,1) is R.\n\nSo can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (2,2), D to (2,0) invalid, R to (3,1), but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo only U to (2,2) possible.\n\n(2,2) is free? Currently, snake has (2,3), (2,4), etc., but after two moves, positions change.\n\nLet's simulate turn by turn.\n\nTurn 47: move D to (1,1)\n\nNew positions: head (1,1), body: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)  // tail (6,5) removed\n\nFood: (3,2), (5,5), (4,6) all present, life span decrease to 2,5,8 respectively? Turn 47, food life span decreases every turn including current, so after turn 47, life span of (3,2) is 2, meaning it has 2 turns left, so exists turn 48 and 49.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life span 5, (4,6) life span 8.\n\nTurn 48: from (1,1), only possible move R to (2,1)\n\nNew head (2,1), direction R (since moved right)\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), body: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)  // tail (6,4) removed? Previous tail was (6,4), removed, and (6,3) is now tail.\n\nPositions after move: head (2,1), then previous head (1,1) added, tail removed. Previous positions: head was (1,1), body (1,2) to (6,4)\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), new head (2,1), body: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)  // since (6,4) was tail, removed.\n\n(6,3) is now tail.\n\nFood: (3,2) life span now 1 (after turn 48), (5,5) life span 4, (4,6) life span 7.\n\nFrom (2,1), direction R, so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (2,2): (2,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nD to (2,0) invalid.\n\nR to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (2,2).\n\nTurn 49: move U to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), direction U (up)\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // tail (6,3) removed\n\nFood: (3,2) is at (3,2), life span now 0 after turn 49? After turn 49, it disappears, so on turn 49 it can be eaten.\n\nAt turn 49, before move, food (3,2) has life span 1, so it exists and can be eaten on turn 49.\n\nBut in this move, I'm moving to (2,2), not to (3,2), so not eaten.\n\nAfter move to (2,2), (3,2) is still there, but after turn 49, it disappears.\n\nNow from (2,2), direction U, so can move U, L, R, not D (reverse).\n\nU to (2,3): but (2,3) is occupied by snake? Current positions: body has (2,3)? From above, positions include (2,3), which is part of body.\n\nAfter turn 49 move, positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // (2,3) is a body segment, so (2,3) is occupied.\n\nSo U to (2,3) is collision, invalid.\n\nL to (1,2): (1,2) is occupied, body segment.\n\nR to (3,2): (3,2) is food, but is it free? Currently, snake not on it, so can move there.\n\nD to (2,1) but D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: only R to (3,2), since U and L are occupied or invalid.\n\nL to (1,2) is occupied, U to (2,3) occupied, D not allowed, so only R to (3,2).\n\nAnd (3,2) has food.\n\nTurn 50: move R to (3,2), eat food, so snake grows.\n\nNew head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nSince food eaten, length increases, so tail does not move.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then body: previous head (2,2) and all body, so [(3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] and tail was (5,3), but since grown, no removal, so 16 segments? Original was 15, after eating, head added, no tail removed, so length 16.\n\nPositions: new head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // yes, 16 positions.\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nFood eaten, so (3,2) removed, other food: (5,5) life span now 3 (after turn 50), (4,6) life span 6.\n\nFrom (3,2), direction R, so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (3,3): but (3,3) is occupied, body segment.\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) is wall, invalid.\n\nR to (4,2): (4,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo only R to (4,2).\n\nTurn 51: move R to (4,2)\n\nNew head (4,2), direction R.\n\nNo food, so tail moves: positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // tail (5,3) removed\n\nTail was (5,3), removed.\n\nNow from (4,2), direction R, so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied, body.\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nR to (5,2): (5,2) free.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo possible U, D, R but U occupied, so D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I have food at (5,5) and (4,6) to consider.\n\nThis path seems to be heading right, but I'm at (4,2), and need to go to (5,5) or (4,6).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, (4,6) at x=4,y=6.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go down to (4,1) or right to (5,2).\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nFirst, this is one option: moving D at turn 47.\n\nBut in this case, I ate the food at (3,2) on turn 50, just before it expired.\n\nNow, second option at turn 47: move R to (2,2)\n\nFrom (1,2), move R to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), direction R (since moved right)\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)  // tail (6,5) removed? No, after move, head to (2,2), previous head (1,2) to body, tail (6,5) removed.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)  // tail (6,5) removed, so (6,4) tail.\n\nFood same as before.\n\nFrom (2,2), direction R, so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied, body segment.\n\nD to (2,1): (2,1) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nR to (3,2): (3,2) has food.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2) to eat food.\n\nIf I move R to (3,2) on turn 48, I can eat the food immediately.\n\nTurn 48: move R to (3,2), eat food.\n\nNew head (3,2), direction R.\n\nGrow, so no tail removal.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)  // 16 segments, tail (6,4)\n\nFood (3,2) eaten, removed.\n\nOther food: (5,5) life span 4 after turn 48, (4,6) life span 7.\n\nFrom (3,2), direction R, so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (3,3): (3,3) occupied.\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (4,2): (4,2) free.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo only R to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 49: move to (4,2), no food, tail moves.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // tail (6,4) removed, (6,3) was there, but tail was (6,4) removed, so (5,3) tail? Previous: after eating, positions up to (6,4), so after move no eat, head to (4,2), body from (3,2) to (6,3), tail (6,4) removed? Let's list:\n\nAfter turn 48: positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nTurn 49: move to (4,2), no food, so new head (4,2), body: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), ... up to (6,3), and tail (6,4) removed, so positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // (6,3) is included, (6,4) removed, so tail (5,3)? (5,3) is last.\n\n(5,3) is position before (6,3), so with (6,4) removed, (6,3) is now tail.\n\nBody: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — yes, tail (6,3).\n\nFrom (4,2), direction R, can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (4,3): occupied, body.\n\nD to (4,1): free.\n\nR to (5,2): free.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo D or R.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which might be accessible.\n\nBut let's compare the two choices at turn 47.\n\nIf I move D at 47, I end up eating (3,2) on turn 50, just in time.\n\nIf I move R at 47, I can eat (3,2) on turn 48, earlier.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat it, so no difference in score for that food.\n\nBut there might be risks or other opportunities.\n\nNow, the other food: (5,5) and (4,6).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the tail position and potential dangers.\n\nIn the first path (move D at 47), by turn 51, I was at (4,2), with tail around (5,3) or something.\n\nIn the second path (move R at 47), at turn 49, I am at (4,2), similar position.\n\nBut let's see the tail movement.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,6) might be easier to reach from some positions.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with the tail.\n\nRecall the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo if the tail is on a food, and I eat that food when moving to tail position, it causes collision because tail doesn't move and head grows into it.\n\nIn this case, currently, tail is at (6,5), which has no food, so no issue.\n\nBut after moves, tail moves.\n\nIn the state, food positions: (3,2), (5,5), (4,6), none of which are occupied by snake, so no food under body except possibly, but can be eaten later.\n\nNow, back to turn 47 choice.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2) at turn 47, I can immediately go to (3,2) on turn 48 to eat food.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,2), and then I have options to go towards other food.\n\nIf I move D to (1,1) at turn 47, I am forced to go to (2,1) then (2,2), then to (3,2) on turn 50 to eat, but on turn 50, the food (3,2) might be gone? No, life span: at turn 47, life_span=3, so exists on 47,48,49, gone on 50. So on turn 49, it can be eaten, turn 50 it is gone.\n\nIn the D path: on turn 49, I was at (2,2), and moved to (3,2) on turn 50? No.\n\nIn D path:\n\nTurn 47: move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 48: move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 49: move U to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 50: from (2,2) to (3,2) to eat food, but on turn 50, food (3,2) has expired, since after turn 49 it disappears.\n\nTurn 49: food (3,2) has life span 1, so on turn 49, before move, it exists. If I move to it on turn 49, I eat it.\n\nIn D path, on turn 49, I moved to (2,2), not to (3,2), so I didn't eat it on turn 49.\n\nThen on turn 50, food is gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nIn D path:\n\nTurn 49: I am at (2,2), and I move to (3,2) on turn 50, but on turn 50, the food (3,2) has disappeared because after turn 49, life span 0, gone.\n\nSo in D path, I missed the food at (3,2).\n\nWhereas in R path, I eat it on turn 48.\n\nSo moving D at 47 causes me to miss the food at (3,2), while moving R allows me to eat it.\n\nTherefore, moving R is better for getting that food.\n\nNow, for the other food.\n\nAlso, moving to (1,1) might be riskier because I am in the corner.\n\nIn R path, I eat (3,2) on turn 48, then to (4,2) on turn 49.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 49, I can choose to go to (4,1), (5,2), or other, but direction from (4,2) is R, so U, D, R possible.\n\nU to (4,3) occupied, so only D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nNow, food at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, which might be near the top? y=6 is high y, since y increases up.\n\ny=6 is the top row, since walls at y=0 bottom, y=7 top wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6, y=6 is the highest row.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is at (4,6).\n\n(5,5) at (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is near the bottom, might not be good.\n\n(5,2) is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (3,1), so bottom row has a wall.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to go up.\n\nBut currently, the snake has segments at (1,6), (2,6), etc., but they will move.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's plan a path to get both remaining food.\n\nFood (5,5) and (4,6), both have time, (5,5) expires after turn 52, (4,6) after turn 55.\n\nAt turn 49, after eating (3,2), I am at (4,2) with direction R.\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I go R to (5,2), then from (5,2), direction R, can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (5,3): but (5,3) might be occupied? At that time, positions change.\n\nLet's simulate from turn 49 in R path.\n\nTurn 49: at (4,2), move to (5,2) for example.\n\nNew head (5,2), direction R.\n\nNo food, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions after turn 48: head (3,2), body to (6,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,2), new head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // tail (6,4) removed, so (5,3) is last? Body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is body.\n\nFrom (5,2), direction R, so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (5,3): occupied, body.\n\nD to (5,1): free? (5,1) not wall, not occupied.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo D to (5,1) or R to (6,2).\n\nIf I go to (6,2), then from there, U to (6,3) or D to (6,1), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (5,5) or (4,6).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so from (5,2), I need to go up.\n\nBut U is occupied, so I have to go D or R first, then find a way up.\n\nFor example, if I go R to (6,2), then from (6,2), direction R, can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,3): might be occupied? At that time, positions: after move to (6,2), head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), etc., and (6,3) might be free if tail moved.\n\nPrevious tail was (5,3), but moved.\n\nLet's not get bogged down.\n\nSince (4,6) is available, and from current position, it might be better to go towards it.\n\nAnother option: from (4,2) on turn 49, I could go D to (4,1), but (4,1) is near the bottom, and obstacle at (3,1), so (4,1) might lead to dead end.\n\n(4,1) is free, but then from there, I can go to (4,0) invalid, (3,1) wall, (5,1) or (4,2) but reverse not allowed.\n\nFrom (4,1), if I go there, direction would be D (if I moved down from (4,2)? From (4,2) to (4,1) is down, D.\n\nThen from (4,1), direction D, can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nD to (4,0) invalid, L to (3,1) wall, R to (5,1) free.\n\nThen to (5,1), and so on, but I'm going away from the food at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\nSo probably not good.\n\nTherefore, from (4,2), better to go R to (5,2).\n\nThen to (5,2), then I can go U? But U occupied, so D to (5,1) or R to (6,2).\n\nIf I go R to (6,2), then from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) or D to (6,1), etc.\n\n(6,3) might be free or not.\n\nAt that point, positions: after moving to (6,2), let's say turn 50: from (5,2) to (6,2)\n\nNew head (6,2), direction R.\n\nNo food, tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions: head (5,2), body (4,2) to (5,3) (since tail was (5,3))\n\nAfter move to (6,2), new head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // tail (5,3) removed, so (4,3) tail? Body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nFrom (6,2), direction R, can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,3): (6,3) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nD to (6,1): free.\n\nR to (7,2) invalid, x=7 wall.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf I go U to (6,3), then from (6,3), I can go to (6,4), (5,3), etc., but (5,5) is at (5,5), so I need to go left and up.\n\n(6,3) to (6,4) U, or to (5,3) L, etc.\n\nBut (5,3) might be occupied later.\n\nTo reach (4,6), from (6,3), I can go to (6,4), (6,5), then to (5,5) or something.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is on the top row.\n\nCurrently, the snake has segments at (1,6), (2,6), but they are moving.\n\nSince I have time, I can go to (4,6) later.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the tail is near or something.\n\nAnother thing: the head is adjacent to tail danger.\n\nBut currently, no food under tail.\n\nPerhaps for turn 47, moving R is better because I get the food at (3,2) and can then maneuver.\n\nIf I move D at 47, I miss (3,2) and end up in a corner.\n\nSo I think R is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format; I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to output from turn 47 onwards for a few turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should output the actions for the next few turns based on the best path.\n\nSince moving R at 47 allows me to eat (3,2) and then I can go for other food.\n\nNow, from there, I should head towards (4,6) or (5,5).\n\n(4,6) has longer life, (5,5) shorter life, so prioritize (5,5).\n\n(5,5) expires after turn 52, so must be eaten by turn 52.\n\nCurrent turn after eating (3,2) is turn 48 or 49.\n\nIn R path: turn 47 move R to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48 move R to (3,2) eat\n\nThen turn 49 at (3,2) move R to (4,2)\n\nNow at (4,2), turn 49.\n\nI need to go to (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (5,5), I can go right then up or up then right.\n\nBut from (4,2), U is blocked, so I need to go D or R first.\n\nIf I go R to (5,2), then from (5,2), U is blocked, so I need to go D to (5,1) or R to (6,2).\n\nIf I go to (6,2), then U to (6,3), then to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (5,5), but (6,5) might be occupied? Not necessarily.\n\nAt turn 49, positions after move to (4,2): head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) // tail (6,3)? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 49 move to (4,2): no eat, so head (4,2), body from (3,2) to (6,3), tail (6,4) removed? Positions: previous after turn 48: head (3,2), body (2,2) to (6,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,2), new head (4,2), body: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)  // (6,4) removed, so (6,3) tail.\n\n(6,3) is tail.\n\nFrom (4,2), move R to (5,2) on turn 50? Turn 49 I am at (4,2), I need to move on turn 50.\n\nLet's define turns.\n\nTurn 47: action\n\nTurn 48: action\n\netc.\n\nSo for turn 47, if I choose R.\n\nThen turn 48: move to (3,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2) move to (4,2)\n\nNow turn 50: from (4,2), I can move to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\nSay move to (5,2)\n\nThen new head (5,2), direction R.\n\nNo food, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // tail (6,3) removed, so (5,3) tail? Body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is body segment.\n\nFrom (5,2), direction R, move U to (5,3) occupied, D to (5,1) free, R to (6,2) free.\n\nSo on turn 51, I can move to (6,2) for example.\n\nNew head (6,2), direction R.\n\nNo food, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // tail (5,3) removed, so (4,3) tail? Body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (4,3)\n\nFrom (6,2), direction R, can move U to (6,3) free, D to (6,1) free.\n\nSay move U to (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nNew head (6,3), direction U.\n\nNo food, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)  // tail (4,3) removed, so (3,3) tail.\n\nFrom (6,3), direction U, can move U to (6,4) free, L to (5,3) free, D not allowed, R invalid.\n\nU to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so from (6,3), I can go L to (5,3), then to (5,4), then to (5,5).\n\nOn turn 53: from (6,3) move to (5,3)\n\nThen to (5,4) on turn 54, then to (5,5) on turn 55, but (5,5) expires after turn 52, so on turn 53 it is gone? Life span at turn 47: 6, so exists turns 47 to 52, gone on 53.\n\nTurn 52 is the last to eat.\n\nOn turn 52, if I am at (6,3), I can move to (6,4) or (5,3), neither is (5,5), so I miss it.\n\nIf from (6,2) on turn 51, I go D to (6,1), that's worse.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 50, instead of going to (6,2), I could go D to (5,1), then to (5,0) invalid, or to (6,1), etc., not helpful.\n\nSo in this path, I might miss (5,5).\n\nBut I have (4,6) with longer life.\n\nTo eat (5,5), I need to be there sooner.\n\nFrom turn 49 at (4,2), I could go directly up, but U is blocked.\n\nOnly after moving away.\n\nAnother idea: from (4,2) on turn 49, instead of going R, I can go D to (4,1), but then I can go R to (5,1), then to (5,2), same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can go to the left or something, but the body is there.\n\nThe snake body is blocking the left and top.\n\nFor example, at turn 49, positions have (1,2) to (1,6), (2,6), etc., so the top-left is occupied.\n\nBut as I move, the tail moves, so paths open up.\n\nTo reach (5,5) quickly, from (4,2), I need to go up, but blocked, so I have to go right or down, then find a way.\n\nSince (4,6) is at (4,6), I could go directly to it from (4,2) by going up, but blocked at (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is occupied until the tail moves.\n\nFor example, at turn 50, if I move to (5,2) from (4,2), then positions change, (4,3) might be free later.\n\nAt turn 50, after moving to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), etc., and (4,3) is still body, but (5,3) is tail, which might move.\n\nBut (4,3) is not free.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps for turn 47, moving R is still the best to get (3,2), and then I can go for (4,6) which has more time.\n\n(4,6) at (4,6), from (4,2), I can go to (4,3) when it's free.\n\nAt turn 49, (4,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter a few moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,2) on turn 50, then to (6,2) on turn 51, then to (6,3) on turn 52, then to (6,4) on turn 53, then to (6,5) on turn 54, then to (5,5) but (5,5) expired, or to (4,6) from (6,5) to (5,5) or (5,6) but (5,6) might be wall? y=6 is playable, x=5,y=6.\n\n(5,6) is free.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (5,5) L or to (5,6) U? (6,5) to (5,5) is left, (6,5) to (5,6) is up-left? Not adjacent directly.\n\nFrom (6,5), can move L to (5,5), U to (6,6) but y=6, U to (6,7) invalid, or D to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) expired.\n\n(4,6) can be reached from (5,6) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor the immediate, at turn 47, moving R to (2,2) allows me to eat the food at (3,2) on turn 48, while moving D causes me to miss it.\n\nMoreover, moving to (1,1) might trap me.\n\nSo I think for turn 47, I should move R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n\nSince the answer should include multiple turns, I can output:\n\nTurn 47: R\n\nTurn 48: R (to eat food)\n\nThen turn 49: R (to (4,2))\n\nThen from there, I need to decide.\n\nBut to think ahead, from (4,2), I can go to (5,2) to start heading right, then to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (5,5) if possible, but (5,5) expires after turn 52, so on turn 52 I need to be at (5,5).\n\nIf on turn 49 I am at (4,2), turn 50 to (5,2), turn 51 to (6,2), turn 52 to (6,3), not at (5,5), so I miss it.\n\nIf from (4,2) on turn 49, I go D to (4,1), then turn 50 to (5,1), turn 51 to (6,1), turn 52 to (6,2), still not.\n\nNo way to reach (5,5) by turn 52 from there.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), and I am at (4,2) on turn 49, I need to be at (5,5) on turn 52 at latest.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (5,5) is 3 steps in Manhattan, but with obstacles or body, it might be possible if I can go up.\n\nBut at turn 49, (4,3) is occupied, so I cannot go up immediately.\n\nOn turn 50, if I move to (5,2), (4,3) might still be occupied, but (5,3) is tail, which moves when I move.\n\nOn turn 50, if I move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), etc., and (4,3) is body, (5,3) is tail.\n\n(5,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 51, if I move from (5,2) to (6,2), then positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), etc., and (4,3) still body, (5,3) removed, so (4,3) tail or something.\n\nAfter move to (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), ..., and (5,3) removed, so (4,3) is now the last body segment? Earlier list: body includes (4,3), which is still there.\n\n(4,3) is not free.\n\nFor example, to go to (5,3), on turn 51, (5,3) is free if it was tail and removed, but in this case, on turn 50, (5,3) is tail, and when I move to (6,2), (5,3) is removed, so (5,3) is free on turn 51.\n\nOn turn 51, from (6,2), I can move U to (6,3) or to (5,3)? (5,3) is not adjacent to (6,2); adjacent are U (6,3), D (6,1), L (5,2) but L is reverse? Direction from (6,2) is R, so L is not allowed.\n\nFrom (6,2), can move U, D, R, but R invalid, so U or D.\n\nCannot move to (5,3) directly from (6,2).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,5) in time.\n\nTherefore, I should focus on (4,6) which has more time.\n\n(4,6) expires after turn 55, so I have until turn 55 to eat it.\n\nFrom current position, I can go there later.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), I can go to (5,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), then to (5,5) if available or to (4,6) from (6,6) but y=6, (6,6) is playable.\n\n(6,6) is x=6,y=6.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (6,6) U, then to (5,6) L, then to (4,6) L.\n\nOr directly from (6,5) to (5,5) L or to (5,6) U.\n\nBut (5,5) may expire.\n\nSince (4,6) is at (4,6), I can go directly from the left when the path is clear.\n\nBut for now, at turn 47, I think moving R is the best choice.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output:\n\nTurn 47: R\n\nTurn 48: R (to eat food at (3,2))\n\nThen for turn 49, from (3,2) move R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 50, from (4,2) move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51, from (5,2) move R to (6,2)\n\nTurn 52, from (6,2) move U to (6,3)\n\nAnd so on, but I need to specify a few turns.\n\nThe format says to output for turns t1, t1+1, etc., so for turn 47 and a few more.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but the output is the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output the sequence for 5 turns.\n\nBut in the D path, I missed the food, so R is better.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,6), which I can get later.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not affecting directly.\n\nSo I think for turn 47, move R.\n\nThen turn 48 move R to eat.\n\nThen turn 49 move R to (4,2)\n\nAfter that, I can go up when possible.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll output the first few moves.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 47\n\n**Current State (Turn 47):**\n- **Grid Boundaries:** Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n- **Internal Obstacle:** (3,1) is blocked.\n- **Snake:**\n  - Head at (1,2) with direction D (down).\n  - Body segments: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Tail at (6,5).\n  - Length: 15 segments.\n- **Food:**\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life_span 3 (exists on turns 47, 48, 49; disappears on turn 50).\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life_span 6 (exists on turns 47 to 52; disappears on turn 53).\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life_span 9 (exists on turns 47 to 55; disappears on turn 56).\n\n**Immediate Moves from (1,2) with Direction D:**\n- Cannot move U (up, reverse direction).\n- D (down to (1,1)): Valid, as (1,1) is free (not wall or occupied).\n- L (left to (0,2)): Invalid (x=0 wall).\n- R (right to (2,2)): Valid, as (2,2) is free.\n\n**Evaluation of Options (5+ Turn Lookahead):**\n- **Option 1: Move D to (1,1) on turn 47**\n  - Path leads to corner with limited mobility.\n  - Forces move to (2,1) on turn 48 (only valid move).\n  - Then move to (2,2) on turn 49.\n  - Food at (3,2) cannot be eaten by turn 49 (missed by turn 50).\n  - Snake misses +1 score and growth opportunity.\n  - Long-term: Trapped near bottom, hard to reach (5,5) or (4,6) efficiently. High risk with low reward.\n  \n- **Option 2: Move R to (2,2) on turn 47**\n  - Positions snake to eat (3,2) on turn 48.\n  - After eating, snake grows to 16 segments, opening paths as tail moves.\n  - Enables access to (5,5) or (4,6) with better positioning.\n  - (5,5) has shorter life (expires turn 52) but can be prioritized after eating (3,2).\n  - (4,6) has longer life (expires turn 55), allowing flexible planning.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving R on turn 47 is optimal. It secures the +1 food at (3,2) immediately, avoids the risky corner, and sets up for long-term survival and further food collection. Missing (3,2) by moving D is unacceptable for score maximization.\n\n**Multi-Turn Plan (5+ Turns):**\n- **Turn 47:** Move R to (2,2) to position for food.\n- **Turn 48:** Move R to (3,2) to eat food (+1, grow to 16 segments).\n- **Turn 49:** Move R to (4,2) to avoid body collisions and head toward open area.\n- **Turn 50:** Move R to (5,2) to continue toward (5,5) or (4,6).\n- **Turn 51:** Move R to (6,2) to reach right edge, preparing for upward movement.\n- **Beyond (5 turns):** After turn 51, prioritize reaching (5,5) by turn 52 via (6,3) or (5,3) if possible, or focus on (4,6) if (5,5) is missed. Avoid tail risks and walls.\n\n**Final Action Sequence (Turns 47 to 51):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 47: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 48: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 49: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 50: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 51: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 48. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders and at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,2), followed by body segments: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (1,2)\n\n- Segment 2: (1,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (1,6)\n\n- Segment 6: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 7: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 9: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 10: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 11: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 12: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 13: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 14: (6,4)\n\nThe snake has 15 segments? Let's count: from head to tail: positions 0 to 14, so 15 segments. Head at index 0, tail at index 14.\n\nSnake head direction is R (right), meaning it was moving right to get to (2,2). Since it's at (2,2) and direction is R, it came from left, probably from (1,2), but (1,2) is the first body segment, which matches.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,2) with value 1 and life_span 2 (so it disappears in 2 turns, including this one? Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 48, life_span=2, so it will disappear after turn 49? Let's clarify life_span.\n\nLife_span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for food at (3,2): life_span=2 at turn 48. After turn 48, it decreases to 1. After turn 49, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 48 or 49, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) with value 1, life_span=5, so available until turn 52 (since turn 48:5, 49:4, 50:3, 51:2, 52:1, disappears after 52? After turn 52, it would be gone, so last chance to eat is turn 52.\n\nLife_span N means it disappears after N turns from now. So at turn t, life_span=N, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\nTypically in such games, if life_span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, countdown is N-1. After turn t+1, countdown is N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown is 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + (N-1), inclusive.\n\nFor (3,2): life_span=2 at turn 48, so countdown: turn 48:2, turn 49:1, turn 50:0 (disappears). So can be eaten on turn 48 or 49.\n\nFor (5,5): life_span=5 at turn 48, so available turns 48 to 52 (countdown 5,4,3,2,1), disappears after turn 52.\n\nFor (4,6): life_span=8, value 1, available turns 48 to 55.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,2), direction R (right).\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next, because that would be opposite.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see the grid. I should sketch this to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,2)\n\nBody: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nTail is (6,4)\n\nFood: (3,2), (5,5), (4,6)\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to head? Head is at (2,2), so (3,2) is one step right.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is at row 5, column 5? Coordinates: (x,y), so (5,5) is x=5,y=5.\n\n(4,6) is x=4,y=6.\n\nNow, head at (2,2), and food at (3,2) which is directly right. But can I move right to (3,2)?\n\nFirst, is (3,2) occupied? By snake or wall?\n\nWalls: (3,1) is wall, but (3,2) is not a wall. Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo (3,2) is not in this list, so not occupied by snake body. Walls are only borders and (3,1), so (3,2) is free.\n\nBut (3,2) has food, and it's adjacent right.\n\nHowever, there's a special case: food can be under snake body? But here, (3,2) is not under snake; it's free.\n\nFood positions are given, so (3,2) has food, and it's not occupied, so I can eat it by moving there.\n\nBut there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, what is the tail? Tail is at (6,4). Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (2,2), tail at (6,4), distance: |2-6|=4, |2-4|=2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (2,2) and (6,4) are not adjacent. So no immediate danger from that.\n\nBut when I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nIf I move to (3,2), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (3,2), and tail stays where it is? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, you move to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so you grow by one segment.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,2), which has food, I eat it, so head moves to (3,2), and a new segment is added, so the tail remains in place for this turn, but since I ate food, the length increases, so the tail doesn't advance.\n\nBut in terms of positions: after moving to (3,2), the new positions: head is (3,2), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and so on, up to tail (6,4) which stays because we ate food.\n\nNow, after this move, the tail is still at (6,4), not moving.\n\nNow, for the next move, the snake will move from (3,2), and the tail will move only if no food is eaten.\n\nBut here, we ate food, so tail stays.\n\nNow, is there any collision? At (3,2), is it safe? (3,2) is not occupied by body, as per positions, and not wall.\n\nBut let's check the body segments. After moving to (3,2), the body includes (2,2), (1,2), etc., so (3,2) is now head, and (2,2) is neck, so no collision.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nFood at (3,2) has short life, only until turn 49, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2): U, D, R (L not allowed).\n\n- U: up to (2,3)\n\n- D: down to (2,1)\n\n- R: right to (3,2)\n\nNow, (2,3): what is there? Snake positions: (2,3) is in the list, it's a body segment. Specifically, it's segment 9: (2,3), which is part of the body.\n\nSo if I move up to (2,3), I collide with my own body, death.\n\nCannot move up.\n\nD: down to (2,1). Is (2,1) occupied? Snake positions: (2,1) not listed. Walls: y=0 is wall, but (2,1) is y=1, not border. x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7 are borders. (2,1): x=2, y=1, not border. Internal obstacle: (3,1), which is different. So (2,1) should be free? But is it occupied by snake?\n\nSnake positions: all listed, (2,1) not there, so free.\n\nBut y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is above y=0, should be ok.\n\n(2,1) is at y=1, x=2.\n\nNow, R: to (3,2), which has food and is free.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves: D or R. U is into body, L not allowed.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), I eat the food, snake grows to 16 segments, head now at (3,2), direction R.\n\nThen, from (3,2), where can I move?\n\nDirection is now R, so cannot move L (left) next.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R.\n\nU: up to (3,3)\n\nD: down to (3,1)\n\nR: right to (4,2)\n\nNow, (3,3): is it occupied? Snake has segment at (3,3), which is segment 10: (3,3). So moving to (3,3) would collide with body.\n\nCannot move up.\n\nD: down to (3,1). But (3,1) is an internal obstacle wall, so cannot move there.\n\nR: right to (4,2). Is (4,2) occupied? Not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSo from (3,2), only possible move is R to (4,2).\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), head at (4,2), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves? Since I ate food at previous move, the tail stayed, but when I move to (4,2), I don't eat food, so the tail should move.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAt turn 48, if I move R to (3,2), eat food, so positions: new head (3,2), then previous body: (2,2) becomes second segment, (1,2) third, ..., up to tail (6,4) still there since we grew.\n\nThe tail is (6,4), and since we ate, it doesn't move this turn.\n\nNow turn 49: I move from (3,2) to (4,2). (4,2) has no food, so head moves to (4,2), and tail moves: the last segment is removed, so tail was (6,4), removed, and the new tail is the second last, which was (6,3)? Positions after turn 48: head (3,2), then segments: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) — tail is (6,4).\n\nAfter moving to (4,2) without eating, the head moves to (4,2), and the tail is removed, so the new positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (6,3), and (6,4) is removed, so tail is now (6,3)? Let's see the list.\n\nPrevious positions before move: index 0: (3,2), 1: (2,2), 2: (1,2), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,6), 7: (2,6), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (3,3), 12: (4,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (6,3), 15: (6,4) — since we grew to 16 segments at turn 48.\n\nAfter turn 48, with growth: positions: [ (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) ]\n\nHead at (3,2), tail at (6,4).\n\nNow turn 49: move to (4,2), no food, so head moves to (4,2), and tail is removed, so new positions: [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) ] and (6,4) gone. Tail now (6,3).\n\nHead at (4,2), direction from (3,2) to (4,2) is right, so direction R.\n\nNow from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2).\n\nBut cannot move opposite, current direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nSo U, D, R.\n\n(4,3): is it occupied? In positions, (4,3) is segment 13 in the new list? New positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), ..., (4,3) is there, index 13: (4,3)? In the list above, after move: [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) ]\n\nSo (4,3) is position index 13, which is a body segment. So moving U to (4,3) would collide.\n\nD: down to (4,1). Is (4,1) occupied? Not in snake, not wall (walls at y=0, x=0,7, and (3,1) wall, but (4,1) is different). (4,1) should be free.\n\nR: right to (5,2). (5,2) not occupied, free.\n\nSo from (4,2), can move D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nBut I need to think about the food and long-term.\n\nBack to turn 48, I have another choice: move D to (2,1).\n\nAt turn 48, from (2,2), move D to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) has no food, so head moves to (2,1), tail moves: since no food eaten, tail advances.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (2,2), body (1,2) to (6,4).\n\nAfter move down: head to (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail (6,4) is removed, so new positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) ] and (6,4) gone. Tail now (6,3).\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D (down).\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: L, R, D (cannot U, opposite to down).\n\nU would be up, opposite, not allowed.\n\nD: down to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nL: left to (1,1)\n\nR: right to (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is wall, internal obstacle, cannot.\n\n(1,1): is it occupied? Not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSo only move L to (1,1).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nBut moving down might not be good, as it leads to a corner or something.\n\nNow, food at (3,2) is close, but I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, x=4.\n\nNow, the snake body is coiled, so I need to navigate without colliding.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating the food at (3,2) immediately because after eating it, I am forced to move right to (4,2), and then from (4,2), I can go down to (4,1) or right to (5,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,2), then I can go towards (5,5) or something.\n\nBut let's see the grid layout.\n\nI should map the grid.\n\nCreate a grid 8x8.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also (3,1) wall.\n\nSo cells:\n\ny=7: all wall\n\ny=6: x=0 wall, x=7 wall, cells: (1,6), (2,6) snake, (3,6) free? (4,6) food, (5,6) free? (6,6) wall? x=6,y=6 not border, x=7 is border.\n\nx from 0 to 7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo for y=6 (row 6): x=0 wall, x=1 to 6 free except obstacles, but obstacle only at (3,1), so (1,6) snake, (2,6) snake, (3,6) free, (4,6) food, (5,6) free, (6,6) free? x=6,y=6, x=6 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so free, but (6,6) not occupied, but in snake positions, at turn 48, (6,4) is tail, (6,3) is body, (5,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) snake, (3,5) free, (4,5) free, (5,5) food, (6,5) free? But (2,5) is snake, etc.\n\nI need to list free cells or something.\n\nSince the snake is long, many cells are occupied.\n\nAt turn 48, occupied by snake:\n\n(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo let's list all snake positions:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — vertical at x=1, y=2 to 6\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) — at x=2, y=2 to 6, but (2,2) is head, (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is there.\n\nThen (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — horizontal at y=3, x=3 to 6\n\nThen (6,4) — tail\n\nAnd head (2,2)\n\nAlso walls at borders and (3,1)\n\nFood at (3,2), (5,5), (4,6)\n\n(3,2) is free, as not occupied.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to plan to eat food and survive.\n\nThe food at (3,2) has short life, only 2 turns, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nTurn 48 and 49 are the only chances.\n\nIf I don't eat it at turn 48, I can eat it at turn 49, but from where?\n\nAt turn 48, if I move D to (2,1), then at turn 49, I move to (1,1), as we saw.\n\nThen from (1,1), I can move to (1,0) but y=0 wall, or to (0,1) x=0 wall, or to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, or to (2,1) which is my neck? After moving to (1,1), positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nIf I move to (1,1) at turn 49, (1,1) is free, so head moves to (1,1), no food, tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions after turn 48 move to (2,1): head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), etc. up to (6,3)\n\nThen move to (1,1): head to (1,1), tail removed, so new head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\n(1,2) is still there, but now it's after (2,2), so moving to (1,1) is fine, no collision.\n\nFrom (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), but (1,2) is body, collision; D to (1,0) wall; L to (0,1) wall; R to (2,1) which is neck, but in snake, moving to the cell that was just vacated might be ok? No, (2,1) is the second segment now.\n\nPositions: head (1,1), then (2,1), so (2,1) is the neck, moving to it would collide.\n\nSo from (1,1), no possible moves? U to (1,2): (1,2) is in the list, index 3: (1,2) is body, yes.\n\nD to (1,0) wall.\n\nL to (0,1) wall.\n\nR to (2,1): (2,1) is the second segment, so moving there would be collision.\n\nSo indeed, from (1,1), all moves are invalid, death.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (2,1) at turn 48 leads to death at turn 49, because I get stuck.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move down at turn 48; it's suicidal.\n\nSo the only safe move at turn 48 is to move right to (3,2) and eat the food.\n\nThen, as before, from (3,2), I must move right to (4,2) at turn 49.\n\nNow at turn 49, after moving to (4,2), head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nAs before, U to (4,3) is body, collision; D to (4,1) free; R to (5,2) free.\n\nNow, (4,1) is at y=1, above wall y=0.\n\n(5,2) is free.\n\nI need to think about the other food.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is near the top.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2) after turn 49.\n\nLet's outline the moves.\n\nTurn 48: move R to (3,2), eat food, grow.\n\nPositions after turn 48: head (3,2), body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nTurn 49: move to (4,2), no food, so head to (4,2), tail removed: (6,4) gone, new tail (6,3)\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 50: from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), then head to (5,2), no food (assuming), so tail moves: remove (6,3), new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n(6,3) removed.\n\nFrom (5,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2)\n\nCannot move L (opposite).\n\n(5,3): is occupied? In positions, (5,3) is the last segment now? Positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), ..., (5,3) is index 14: (5,3), body segment. So moving U to (5,3) collision.\n\nD to (5,1): free? (5,1) not occupied, not wall.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo can move D or R.\n\nIf I move to (4,1) at turn 50 instead.\n\nFrom (4,2), move D to (4,1).\n\nHead to (4,1), no food, tail moves: remove (6,3), new positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), but (4,2) is neck, collision; D to (4,0) wall; L to (3,1) wall; R to (5,1)\n\n(5,1) free? Yes.\n\nSo only move R to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), and so on.\n\nBut moving down to (4,1) might be limiting.\n\nNow, back to food: (5,5) is at (5,5), life_span 5, so available until turn 52.\n\n(4,6) at (4,6), life_span 8, available until turn 55.\n\nAfter turn 49, head at (4,2), I should aim to go towards (5,5) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is directly above, but there are body segments in the way.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I go up, but (4,3) is occupied, so I cannot go up directly.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nPerhaps moving right to (5,2) is better, then I can go up towards (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), from (5,2), I need to go up to y=5.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nLet's see what cells are free.\n\nI should simulate a few turns.\n\nFirst, at turn 48, I must move R to (3,2) to survive.\n\nThen turn 49, move to (4,2).\n\nNow at turn 50, from (4,2), I should move R to (5,2) to go towards the center or to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 50: move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2), I can move U to (5,3) but it's body, collision; D to (5,1); R to (6,2)\n\n(6,2) is free? x=6,y=2, not wall, not occupied.\n\n(5,1) free.\n\nIf I move R to (6,2), head to (6,2), no food, tail moves: remove (5,3), new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\n(5,3) removed.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) but x=7 wall.\n\nCannot move L (opposite).\n\n(6,3): is it occupied? In positions, (6,3) not in list, free? After tail move, positions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (4,3) is last, (6,3) not there, so free.\n\n(4,3) is at index 14: (4,3), so (6,3) free.\n\nD to (6,1) free.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nSo U or D.\n\n(6,3) is above, (6,1) below.\n\nBut (5,5) is food, so going up might be better.\n\nMove U to (6,3).\n\nThen head to (6,3), no food, tail moves: remove (4,3), new positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n\n(4,3) removed.\n\nDirection U (since moved up from (6,2) to (6,3)? From (5,2) to (6,2) was right, then to (6,3) is up, so direction now U.\n\nThen from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\nCannot move D (opposite to up).\n\n(6,2) is neck, collision if move down.\n\nU to (6,4): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nL to (5,3): free? (5,3) not in positions, free.\n\nR invalid.\n\nSo can move U or L.\n\n(6,4) is where tail was, but now free.\n\n(5,3) is left.\n\nFood at (5,5), so moving left to (5,3) then up might be good.\n\nBut (5,3) is free, yes.\n\nMove to (5,3) at turn 52? Let's list turns.\n\nTurn 50: move to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move to (6,2)\n\nTurn 52: from (6,2) move U to (6,3) — I said move U to (6,3) at turn 51? Turn 51: from (5,2) move to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 52: from (6,2) move to (6,3)\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,3), move L to (5,3) or U to (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is free, and from there I can go to (5,4) or something.\n\n(5,5) is food at (5,5), so from (5,3), I can go up to (5,4), then (5,5).\n\nBut I need to check if (5,4) is free.\n\nAt turn 53, positions depend.\n\nFirst, food (5,5) life_span 5 at turn 48, so available turns 48 to 52. Turn 48: count 5, 49:4, 50:3, 51:2, 52:1, disappears after turn 52? After turn 52, it is gone.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 52 or before.\n\nTurn 52 is the last chance.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 52, head is at (6,3) or where?\n\nTurn 48: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2)  // I moved to (6,2) at turn 51\n\nAt turn 51, from (6,2), I can move U to (6,3) or D to (6,1), etc.\n\nBut food (5,5) must be eaten by turn 52.\n\nAt turn 51, head at (6,2), (5,5) is at (5,5), which is not adjacent; it's two moves away.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (5,5): need to go left and up, but not directly possible in one turn.\n\nDistance: |6-5|=1, |2-5|=3, so at least 3 moves, but at turn 51, if I move to (6,3), still far.\n\nAt turn 50, head at (5,2), (5,5) is at y=5, x=5, so from (5,2) to (5,5) is up 3 steps.\n\nBut at turn 50, I am at (5,2), I can move, but (5,3) is occupied at that time.\n\nAt turn 50, after moving to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), ..., and (5,3) is body segment.\n\nSpecifically, in the list: (5,3) is the last segment before tail move? After turn 50 move to (5,2), positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] since we removed (6,3) or something? Let's correct.\n\nAfter turn 49: positions [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) ] head (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: move to (5,2), no food, so head to (5,2), tail removed: (6,3) gone, new positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] and (5,3) is still there? Index: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — (5,3) is the 15th segment? List: 0:(5,2), 1:(4,2), 2:(3,2), 3:(2,2), 4:(1,2), 5:(1,3), 6:(1,4), 7:(1,5), 8:(1,6), 9:(2,6), 10:(2,5), 11:(2,4), 12:(2,3), 13:(3,3), 14:(4,3), 15:(5,3) — yes, (5,3) is body.\n\nSo at turn 50, (5,3) is occupied, so I cannot move up to (5,3) from (5,2).\n\nI can only move D to (5,1) or R to (6,2).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), from (5,2), I need to go up, but (5,3) is blocked until the snake moves.\n\nAt turn 51, if I move R to (6,2), then positions: head to (6,2), tail removed: (5,3) gone, new positions: [ (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\n(5,3) removed.\n\nNow (5,3) is free, but head at (6,2), not at (5,2).\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is free, as not in positions.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), from (6,2) or (6,3), it's not close, and turn 52 is last chance, but I can't reach it by turn 52.\n\nAt turn 51, head at (6,2), to reach (5,5), I need to go to (6,3) or (5,2), but (5,2) is neck, cannot.\n\nIf I move U to (6,3) at turn 51, head at (6,3), then at turn 52, I can move L to (5,3) or U to (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is free now, move to (5,3), but (5,3) is not (5,5), still need to go to (5,4) and (5,5), but at turn 52, I am at (5,3) or (6,3), not at (5,5).\n\nIf at turn 51 I am at (6,2), move to (6,3), then turn 52 move to (5,3), head at (5,3), then I can move to (5,4) if free, but at turn 52, positions: after move to (5,3), let's see.\n\nTurn 51: moved to (6,3) from (6,2)? Turn 51: from (6,2) move to (6,3), head (6,3), no food, tail removed: (4,3) gone? Positions after turn 50: [ (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] after tail move when moving to (6,2) at turn 51? Turn 51 move from (5,2) to (6,2): head to (6,2), tail (5,3) removed, positions: [ (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\nThen turn 51 move to (6,3): from (6,2) to (6,3), head to (6,3), no food, tail removed: (4,3) gone, new positions: [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\n(4,3) removed.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 52: from (6,3), move L to (5,3) or U to (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is free, move to (5,3), head to (5,3), no food, tail moves: remove (3,3), new positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)\n\n(3,3) removed.\n\nNow at (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), which I can move to from (5,4) or (4,5), etc.\n\nAt turn 52, head at (5,3), (5,5) is still available? Life_span: at turn 48, life_span=5, so after 4 turns, at turn 52, countdown should be 1, so available on turn 52.\n\nAfter turn 52, it disappears, so last chance turn 52.\n\nBut at turn 52, head is at (5,3), (5,5) is two steps away, I can't eat it on turn 52 because it's not adjacent.\n\nTo eat on turn 52, I need to be at (5,4), (4,5), (5,6), or (6,5) on turn 52.\n\nBut at turn 52, I am at (5,3), so not adjacent, and after turn 52, it disappears.\n\nSo I missed the food at (5,5).\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat (5,5).\n\nBut at turn 50, from (4,2), instead of moving R to (5,2), I could move D to (4,1), but that might not help.\n\nFrom (4,2) at turn 50, move D to (4,1).\n\nThen head to (4,1), no food, tail moves: remove (6,3), positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] after turn 49, positions include (5,3) and (6,3), but when moving to (4,1) at turn 50, tail (6,3) removed, so positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] and (5,3) is still there? Index: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — (5,3) is body.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 51: from (4,1), move R to (5,1) as only move, head to (5,1), no food, tail moves: remove (5,3), positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\n(5,3) removed.\n\nDirection R (from (4,1) to (5,1) is right).\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1) neck, collision, R to (6,1)\n\n(6,1) free.\n\nSo move R to (6,1) or U to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free now? In positions, (5,2) not there, free.\n\nBut (5,5) is far, and turn 52 last chance, not reachable.\n\nSo in both cases, I cannot eat (5,5) because the body is blocking the way.\n\nAt turn 48, after eating (3,2), I am at (3,2), and (5,5) is available, but from (3,2) at turn 49, I have to move to (4,2), then at turn 50, I can only go to (5,2) or (4,1), both not helping for (5,5).\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the food at (3,2) at turn 48, but I have to, because the only alternative is down, which kills me.\n\nAt turn 48, if I don't move, but I have to move.\n\nOr is there a way to eat (3,2) later? But it disappears after turn 49.\n\nAt turn 48, if I move to (3,2), I eat it.\n\nIf I don't move to it, at turn 49, I could move to it from (2,2) but at turn 49, from where?\n\nAt turn 48, I must move, and only R or D, D leads to death, so only R.\n\nSo I have to eat (3,2) at turn 48.\n\nThen I miss (5,5) because of the body.\n\nBut there is another food at (4,6), life_span 8, so available longer.\n\nI should focus on that.\n\nAfter turn 49, head at (4,2), I can move to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is same x, different y.\n\nFrom (4,2), I need to go up, but (4,3) is occupied.\n\nSo I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move R to (5,2), then to (5,3) later when free, or to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut let's plan to reach (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), and it has food.\n\nAt turn 48, positions include (1,6), (2,6), etc., so (4,6) is free.\n\nLife_span 8, so available turns 48 to 55.\n\nAt turn 49, head at (4,2), I can move to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\nIf I move to (5,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), etc., as before.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can go up to (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n\n(4,6) is at x=4, so I need to go left.\n\nBut the body is on the left.\n\nPerhaps I can move up from other positions.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 50, from (4,2), instead of moving R or D, but I have to choose.\n\nI think for now, I should proceed with moving R at each step to free space.\n\nThen later, when the body moves, I can access other areas.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger, but not relevant now.\n\nPerhaps for the immediate moves, I can plan turn by turn.\n\nSince the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=48.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, etc.\n\nFrom above, at turn 48, must move R to (3,2).\n\nTurn 49, must move R to (4,2).\n\nTurn 50, from (4,2), I can move R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nMoving R to (5,2) seems better to go towards the center.\n\nThen turn 51, from (5,2), move R to (6,2) or D to (5,1).\n\nMove R to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 52, from (6,2), move U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nMove U to (6,3) to go up.\n\nThen turn 53, from (6,3), move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n\nMove L to (5,3) to go towards (5,5) but (5,5) is gone, so towards (4,6) or other.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), from (5,3), I can go to (5,4), (5,5), then to (4,5) or something.\n\nBut (5,5) is gone, so to (4,5) or directly.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,3), move to (5,4), then to (5,5), then to (4,5) or (5,6), but (5,6) might be free.\n\ny=6, x=5.\n\nIn initial, (1,6), (2,6) are snake, (3,6) free, (4,6) food, (5,6) free, (6,6) free.\n\nAs the snake moves, cells free up.\n\nFor example, at turn 53, if I am at (5,3), I can move to (5,4), assuming free.\n\nThen to (5,5), but no food, then to (4,5) or (5,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is food, so from (4,5) or (3,6) or (5,6), I can eat it.\n\nSince life_span long, I have time.\n\nBut let's define the moves for the first few turns.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAt turn 50, if I move D to (4,1), then I am at (4,1), then must move R to (5,1), then to (6,1), then from (6,1), I can move U to (6,2) or D to (6,0) wall, so U to (6,2), but then I am at (6,2), same as before.\n\nBut moving down might be riskier if there are walls.\n\nSo better to move right.\n\nMoreover, for the food at (4,6), I can reach it later.\n\nSo for turn 48 to 52:\n\nTurn 48: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2)  // from (4,2) to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2)  // from (5,2) to (6,2)\n\nTurn 52: move U to (6,3)  // from (6,2) to (6,3)\n\nNow, at turn 52, head at (6,3), and I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, since I am thinking 5 turns ahead, this seems reasonable for survival.\n\nI could at turn 50 move D, but I think R is better.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) is eaten at turn 48, good.\n\n(5,5) is missed, but it was not reachable anyway.\n\n(4,6) can be targeted later.\n\nFor example, from (6,3) at turn 52, I can move to (6,4) or (5,3).\n\n(5,3) might be free, as the body has moved.\n\nThen to (5,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I can go to (4,5) or (3,6), etc.\n\nBut I think for now, the moves are fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 48: R\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nBut turn 52 is t1+4, since t1=48, t1+4=52.\n\nThe answer should include at least 5 turns: 48 to 52 or 48 to 53.\n\nLet's see the format: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably 5 turns.\n\nAlso, for turn 51, from (5,2) to (6,2), I moved R, but at turn 51, from (5,2), I could move D to (5,1), but I chose R to go to the right.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 52, from (6,2) to (6,3) U.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the initial, there is a special case about food under body, but not here.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nSo I think this is ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves at least 5 turns ahead (turns 48 to 52). The key considerations are:\n\n- **Immediate Risks**: At turn 48, moving up (U) from (2,2) leads to body collision at (2,3), and moving down (D) leads to a dead end at turn 49 (stuck at (1,1) with no valid moves). Thus, moving right (R) to (3,2) is the only safe option, allowing the snake to eat the positive food at (3,2) (life_span=2, so it must be eaten by turn 49).\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (5,5) (life_span=5) is unreachable by turn 52 (its last available turn) due to body blockages, so it is skipped. The food at (4,6) (life_span=8) has a longer lifespan and can be targeted later (beyond turn 52). Eating (3,2) now adds +1 to the score and increases length.\n- **Path Planning**: After eating (3,2), the snake must move right to (4,2) to avoid collisions. From there, moving right to (5,2) and (6,2) avoids body segments and walls, opening up space for future maneuvers. At (6,2), moving up to (6,3) positions the snake to access the upper grid later, aiming for (4,6) or other areas.\n- **Long-term Survival**: Moving right and up avoids tight spaces and body collisions. The snake's body will gradually shift, freeing cells (e.g., (1,2)-(1,6) area) for navigation. By turn 52, the snake is at (6,3), with options to head toward (4,6) or explore safely.\n\n**Planned Moves (turns 48-52):**\n\n- **Turn 48**: Move R (right) to (3,2) – Eat positive food (+1 score, length increases).\n- **Turn 49**: Move R (right) to (4,2) – Safe move, no food.\n- **Turn 50**: Move R (right) to (5,2) – Avoids body; positions for upward movement.\n- **Turn 51**: Move R (right) to (6,2) – Stays clear of walls and body.\n- **Turn 52**: Move U (up) to (6,3) – Begins ascent toward (4,6) area.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival, avoids all immediate collisions, and sets up for future food collection (e.g., (4,6) by turn 55).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 49: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 50: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 51: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 52: U (up)\n}",

        "step": 49,

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 49, and I have to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (3,2), and the body segments follow: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). That's 16 segments, so the snake is 16 units long.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,5) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 10 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, so each gives +1 score and increases length by 1 when eaten.\n\nLife span: for (5,5), it disappears after 4 turns, meaning on turn 49 + 4 = turn 53, it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (4,6) lasts until turn 49 + 7 = 56, and (2,2) until turn 59.\n\nBut life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so on turn 49, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left, including turn 49. So if not eaten by turn 52, it disappears before turn 53? Let me clarify the life-span rule.\n\nIt says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, for food with life span L on turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\nSuppose a food appears on turn T with life span N. On turn T, countdown is N. After turn T, countdown becomes N-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So if countdown is C on a given turn, it disappears after C turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns until countdown > 0.\n\nFor example, food with life span 4 on turn 49: countdown=4 on turn 49, so it can be eaten on turn 49, 50, 51, 52. After turn 52, it disappears, so not available on turn 53.\n\nSimilarly, life span 7 on turn 49: available until turn 55 (since 49+6=55? Turn 49: countdown=7, turn 50:6, ..., turn 55: countdown=1, turn 56: countdown=0, disappears. So last chance to eat is turn 55 for life span 7.\n\nGeneral: on turn T, food with life span L is available from turn T to turn T + L - 1 inclusive.\n\nFor (5,5): L=4, available turns: 49,50,51,52\n\n(4,6): L=7, available turns: 49 to 55\n\n(2,2): L=10, available turns: 49 to 58\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,2), direction R (right). So from (3,2), moving right would go to (4,2), but let's see what's around.\n\nFirst, I need to find possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head: (3,2)\n\nPossible directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n\nBut movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left). So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and obstacle at (3,1)\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- U to (3,3): what's there? Let's see snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo (3,3) is a body segment? Let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\nIndex: 0: (3,2) head\n\n1: (2,2)\n\n2: (1,2)\n\n3: (1,3)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,5)\n\n6: (1,6)\n\n7: (2,6)\n\n8: (2,5)\n\n9: (2,4)\n\n10: (2,3)\n\n11: (3,3)\n\n12: (4,3)\n\n13: (5,3)\n\n14: (6,3)\n\n15: (6,4) tail\n\n(6,4) is the tail.\n\nNow, for moving from head (3,2):\n\n- U to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by snake body at index 11. But is it safe? When moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so collision only if head hits a body segment that is not the tail, and the tail will move.\n\nGeneral rule: after moving, if head is in a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides. But since the tail moves, if head moves to the current tail position, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by segment at index 11, which is not the tail. Tail is at (6,4). So if head moves to (3,3), which is a body cell, it will collide because that segment is still there when head arrives.\n\nAfter movement, the snake shifts: head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its position.\n\nSo when head moves to a cell, if that cell was occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's a collision. If it was the current tail, it's ok because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, (3,3) is index 11, which is not tail, so moving to (3,3) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, check other directions.\n\n- R to (4,2): what is at (4,2)? Let's see if it's occupied or wall.\n\nSnake positions: (4,2) not in the list. Walls: borders, so (4,2) is within bounds? x=4, y=2, min x=0 max x=7, min y=0 max y=7, so (4,2) is valid, no wall. Obstacle at (3,1), not (4,2). So (4,2) is empty? Food? Foods are at (5,5), (4,6), (2,2), not (4,2). So (4,2) is free.\n\n- D to (3,1): (3,1) is an obstacle, wall. So cannot move there.\n\n- L to (2,2): but (2,2) is the first body segment, index 1. And also, cannot move left because current direction is R, opposite is not allowed. But even if allowed, (2,2) is occupied, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R but D is wall, U is body collision, R is free.\n\nU to (3,3): (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nD to (3,1): wall, collision.\n\nR to (4,2): free, no collision.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,2)? But that can't be right; let me double-check.\n\nSnake positions: (3,2), (2,2), ... so (2,2) is adjacent, but moving R to (4,2) is not adjacent in the sense that (4,2) is not directly a neighbor? Head at (3,2), adjacent cells: up (3,3), down (3,1), left (2,2), right (4,2).\n\n(3,3) is occupied by snake body at index 11? List: positions: (3,2) head, (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), ... so (3,3) is index 11, yes.\n\n(2,2) is index 1.\n\n(4,2) is not in the list, so free.\n\n(3,1) is wall.\n\nSo indeed, only right to (4,2) is safe? But what about the tail? No, tail is far away.\n\nBut let's confirm the move: if I move R to (4,2), head moves to (4,2), then the body: segment 1 moves to (3,2) which was head, segment 2 moves to (2,2), and so on, tail moves from (6,4) to (6,3)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAfter move R:\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nThen body: segment 0 (old head) becomes segment 1: (3,2)\n\nSegment 1 was (2,2) becomes segment 2: (2,2)\n\nBetter to think: the positions shift.\n\nOld positions: indices 0 to 15: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nAfter move R, head moves to (4,2), then the body segments follow: the new segment 1 is the old head position (3,2), segment 2 is old segment 1 (2,2), segment 3 is old segment 2 (1,2), ..., up to segment 15 is old segment 14 (6,3), and the tail old segment 15 (6,4) is left, so removed.\n\nNew snake: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nOld segment 15 was (6,4), not included, so tail is now (6,3).\n\nAnd (4,2) is free, so no collision.\n\nBut is (4,2) within bounds? x=4, y=2, yes, not wall.\n\nSo moving R to (4,2) is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought U and D are not possible, only R.\n\nU to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied, and it's not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,1) wall.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo for turn 49, only possible move is R to (4,2).\n\nBut the problem is to think ahead for multiple turns, not just one.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,2), which is currently occupied by the snake body? (2,2) is segment index 1, which is the second segment.\n\nBut food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) has food with value 1, life span 10.\n\nBut it's under the snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,2), and then head moves to it.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is occupied, so not accessible.\n\nSimilarly, other foods at (5,5) and (4,6).\n\nNow, for turn 49, I must move R to (4,2), as that's the only choice.\n\nThen, after that, head is at (4,2), direction is now R, since I moved right.\n\nCurrent direction was R, I moved R, so new direction is R.\n\nNow, from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\nBut cannot move opposite, current direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nSo possible: U, D, R.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- U to (4,3): what is there? Snake positions after move: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nSo (4,3) is occupied by segment index 13? New indices: 0: (4,2) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (1,2), 4: (1,3), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,6), 8: (2,6), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (4,3), 14: (5,3), 15: (6,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) is index 13, body segment, not tail (tail is (6,3)), so moving to (4,3) would collide.\n\n- D to (4,1): is it wall? y=1, x=4, borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall unless specified. Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also internal obstacle (3,1). (4,1) is not x=0,7 or y=0,7, and not (3,1), so it should be free. But is it occupied? Not in snake positions, so free.\n\n- R to (5,2): (5,2) not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves: D to (4,1) or R to (5,2). U is collision.\n\nNow, also, food: (5,5), (4,6), (2,2)\n\n(2,2) is occupied by body, index 2 now? New positions: index 2 is (2,2), which has food under it, but since body is there, cannot eat yet.\n\nI need to think about eating food.\n\nFor (5,5): at (5,5), which is not occupied, so if head moves there, can eat.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) at (4,6), free.\n\n(2,2) occupied.\n\nAlso, life span: (5,5) has life span 4 on turn 49, so after turn 49, on turn 50, life span decreases to 3, etc.\n\nTurn 49: I must move to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 50: head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nI can move D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), head to (5,2), then snake: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc., tail (5,3)? Old tail (6,3) moves to (6,2)? Let's not get into details unless necessary.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go towards food.\n\nBut let's think longer term.\n\nFirst, the food at (2,2) is under the body, and it's at index 2, which is close to head.\n\nThe snake is long, 16 segments.\n\nTo eat the food at (2,2), I need the body to move away from (2,2), so that it becomes free, then head can move to it.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is occupied by segment, and as the snake moves, that segment will move to the next position.\n\nFor example, if I move right from (4,2) to (5,2), then the segment at (2,2) will move to where? When head moves to (5,2), body shifts: new segment 1 is old (4,2), segment 2 is old (3,2), segment 3 is old (2,2) which moves to old segment 2 position? After move to (5,2):\n\nNew positions: head (5,2)\n\n1: (4,2)  // old head\n\n2: (3,2)  // old segment 1\n\n3: (2,2)  // old segment 2\n\n4: (1,2)  // old segment 3\n\n5: (1,3)  // old segment 4\n\nand so on, up to tail: old segment 15 (6,3) moves to (6,2)? Old positions had (6,3) as tail, after move, new segment 15 is old segment 14 (5,3)? Let's list old after turn 49 move.\n\nAfter turn 49: snake at (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nIndex 0: (4,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (1,2), 4: (1,3), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,6), 8: (2,6), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (4,3), 14: (5,3), 15: (6,3)\n\nNow, if on turn 50, I move R to (5,2):\n\nHead to (5,2), which is free.\n\nNew head: (5,2)\n\nThen body: segment 1: old head (4,2)\n\nSegment 2: old segment 1 (3,2)\n\nSegment 3: old segment 2 (2,2)\n\nSegment 4: old segment 3 (1,2)\n\nSegment 5: old segment 4 (1,3)\n\n...\n\nSegment 15: old segment 14 (5,3)\n\nAnd old segment 15 (6,3) is gone.\n\nSo (2,2) is still occupied by segment 3.\n\nThe food at (2,2) is under the body, so it remains under until the body moves away.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the segment that was at (2,2) moves to a new position, but the cell (2,2) might become free if no other segment is there.\n\nFor example, after this move, segment 3 is at (2,2), but in the new positions, segment 3 is at (2,2), so (2,2) is still occupied by the snake, so food is still covered.\n\nTo free (2,2), I need the snake to move such that the segment at (2,2) moves and no other segment comes to (2,2).\n\nSince the snake is moving, positions change.\n\n(2,2) can be freed when the segment that was there moves away and no new segment comes.\n\nBut in this case, the body is dense around there.\n\nLet's see the path: the snake has a loop or something.\n\nPositions: from head (4,2), to (3,2), to (2,2), then to (1,2), up to (1,6), then right to (2,6), down to (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), then to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).\n\nSo (2,2) is connected to (1,2) and (3,2), etc.\n\nTo free (2,2), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (2,2) moves to another cell, and (2,2) is not reoccupied immediately.\n\nFor example, if I move the head in a way that the body moves.\n\nBut it's complicated; I should focus on the available food first.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (4,6) are accessible, while (2,2) is under body and has long life, so I can go for the other food first.\n\n(5,5) has short life, only until turn 52.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2) - must do.\n\nTurn 50: head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nI can move D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), then head to (5,2).\n\nFrom there, I can go to (5,3) or (5,1) or (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is occupied by body, segment 14 in current, which is (5,3), so not good.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), new positions: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) is tail.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2)\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nU to (5,3): (5,3) is tail, so moving to tail is safe, and if there is food, I can eat, but no food at (5,3).\n\nD to (5,1): free, no wall or body.\n\nR to (6,2): free, since no body there, walls x=7 is wall, but x=6, y=2 is not border, so free.\n\nSo options: U, D, R.\n\nU to (5,3) is safe because it's tail.\n\nThen, if I move U to (5,3), head to (5,3), which was tail, so I eat nothing, snake moves, tail moves away.\n\nNew head (5,3), body: (5,2), (4,2), etc., tail old (4,3) or something.\n\nBut no food eaten.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go to (6,2) or (5,1), etc.\n\nBut let's think about food.\n\nFood at (5,5): I need to reach it.\n\nFrom current position after turn 49, head at (4,2), I can move to (4,1) or (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nIf I move to (5,2) on turn 50, then from (5,2), I can move U to (5,3) on turn 51, but (5,3) is tail, so safe, but no food.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or (6,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\n(6,3) is wall? x=6, y=3, not border, so free.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nFood at (5,5), so I can go up from there.\n\nBut let's plan a path to (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 50, if I move R to (5,2), then turn 51 move U to (5,3), turn 52 move U to (5,4), turn 53 move U to (5,5). But (5,5) food life span 4, available until turn 52, so on turn 53 it is gone? Turn 52 is last chance.\n\nTurn 49: food life span 4, available turns 49,50,51,52.\n\nTurn 53 it disappears.\n\nSo to eat on turn 52, I need to be at (5,5) on turn 52.\n\nIf I move:\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2) to (5,2)  // at (5,2) on turn 50\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2) to (5,3)  // at (5,3) on turn 51\n\nTurn 52: from (5,3) to (5,4)  // at (5,4) on turn 52, not (5,5)\n\nThen I can move to (5,5) on turn 53, but food gone.\n\nIf on turn 51 from (5,2) I move directly to (5,4)? But I can only move one step at a time, so from (5,2) to (5,3) or (5,4) not possible; must be adjacent cells.\n\nSo from (5,2) on turn 51, I can only go to (5,3), (5,1), (6,2), or (4,2) but (4,2) is body, so not.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2) on turn 50, positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), ..., (5,3) tail.\n\nOn turn 51, from (5,2), move U to (5,3): head to (5,3), which was tail, so it becomes new head, and the tail moves away, so no growth, snake length same.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail? Old tail was (5,3), which is now head, so new tail is old segment 14 (4,3).\n\nList: after turn 50 move to (5,2): positions (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\nIndex 0: (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (1,2), 5: (1,3), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,6), 9: (2,6), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,4), 12: (2,3), 13: (3,3), 14: (4,3), 15: (5,3) tail.\n\nOn turn 51, move U to (5,3): head to (5,3), which is current tail, so no collision, and no food, so snake moves: new head (5,3), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (4,3), and tail old (4,3) is removed? New segments: segment 1: old head (5,2), segment 2: old segment 1 (4,2), ..., segment 14: old segment 13 (3,3), segment 15: old segment 14 (4,3), and old tail (5,3) is now head, so new tail is (4,3).\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nOn turn 52, from (5,3), I can move to (5,4), which is free, then on turn 53 to (5,5), but food at (5,5) is gone on turn 53.\n\nTurn 52: from (5,3) to (5,4), at (5,4) on turn 52.\n\n(5,5) food is available on turn 52, but I am at (5,4) on turn 52, so to eat on turn 52, I need to be at (5,5) on turn 52.\n\nBut on turn 52, I am at (5,4), so I can't eat it.\n\nIf on turn 51, from (5,2), I move to (5,3), which is on turn 51, and (5,3) is not food, then on turn 52 from (5,3) to (5,4), at (5,4) on turn 52, still not (5,5).\n\nSo I can't reach (5,5) by turn 52 from this path.\n\nFrom turn 50 position (4,2), instead of moving R to (5,2), I could move D to (4,1).\n\nOn turn 50, from (4,2) move D to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is free, no wall or body.\n\nNew head (4,1), direction down.\n\nThen snake: head (4,1), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc., tail (5,3) or something.\n\nPositions after move: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nFrom (4,1), on turn 51, I can move to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, or (3,1) obstacle, or (5,1), or (4,2) but (4,2) is body.\n\nCurrent direction D (down), so cannot move U (up).\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,1) obstacle, R to (5,1), D to (4,0) wall. So only possible move R to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is free, not wall or body.\n\nSo move to (5,1) on turn 51.\n\nThen from there, it's far from (5,5), and I have only until turn 52 for (5,5), so impossible to reach from here.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat the (5,5) food because from current position, even on turn 50, I can only be at (4,2) or move to (5,2) or (4,1), both are not close enough to reach (5,5) by turn 52.\n\nTurn 49: at (3,2), move to (4,2) on turn 50? Turn 49 action is move to (4,2), so on turn 49, after move, head at (4,2) for turn 50 start.\n\nLet's clarify the turn timing.\n\nTurn t1: I take action, move to a new position, and that becomes the state for next turn.\n\nOn turn 49, I perform action, move to new cell, then the state updates for turn 50.\n\nSo on turn 49, after action, head is at new position for the start of turn 50.\n\nFor food on turn 49, I can eat if I move to food cell on this turn.\n\nBut on turn 49, head at (3,2), food at (5,5), (4,6), (2,2), none at (3,2), so no eat.\n\nI move to (4,2), not food.\n\nSo on turn 50, head at (4,2), food still available.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move to (5,2) or (4,1) on turn 50.\n\nIf to (5,2), on turn 50, at (5,2), not (5,5).\n\nThen turn 51, from (5,2) to (5,3) or other, at best (5,3) on turn 51.\n\nTurn 52 from (5,3) to (5,4), at (5,4) on turn 52.\n\n(5,5) is available on turn 52, but I am at (5,4), so I can move to (5,5) on turn 53, but on turn 53 it's gone.\n\nIf on turn 52 I am at (5,4), I can move to (5,5) on turn 52? On turn 52, I start at some position, say (5,4), then I move to (5,5) on that turn, so I eat on turn 52.\n\nBut on turn 52, I need to be at (5,5) after move.\n\nSo to be at (5,5) on turn 52, I need to move to (5,5) on turn 52.\n\nThat means on turn 51, I need to be adjacent to (5,5), so at (5,4), (4,5), (5,6), or (6,5).\n\nBut from above, on turn 51, I can be at (5,3) if I moved to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nFrom (5,3), (5,4) is adjacent, so on turn 52, I can move to (5,4) or to (5,5)? From (5,3), I can move to (5,4), which is adjacent, but not directly to (5,5) unless I move multiple steps.\n\nOn turn 51, if I am at (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) on turn 51, then on turn 51 I am at (5,4).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) to eat on turn 52.\n\nYes!\n\nPath to eat (5,5) on turn 52:\n\n- Turn 49: move R to (4,2)  // must, only choice\n\n- Turn 50: from (4,2) move R to (5,2)  // at (5,2) on turn 50\n\n- Turn 51: from (5,2) move U to (5,3)  // at (5,3) on turn 51\n\n- Turn 52: from (5,3) move U to (5,4)  // at (5,4) on turn 52? No\n\nOn turn 51, after moving U to (5,3), I am at (5,3) for the start of turn 52.\n\nThen on turn 52, I move from (5,3) to (5,4) or to (5,5)? (5,5) is not adjacent to (5,3); adjacent cells are (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), (4,3).\n\n(5,4) is up, (5,2) down, (6,3) right, (4,3) left.\n\n(5,5) is two steps away, so I cannot reach it directly.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 52, I move to (5,4), then on turn 53 to (5,5), but food gone.\n\nIf on turn 51, from (5,2), I move directly to (5,4)? Not possible, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo from (5,2) on turn 51, I can only go to (5,3), (5,1), (6,2), or (4,2) but (4,2) is body.\n\nNone of these are (5,4) or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is not adjacent to (5,2).\n\nSo it's impossible to be at a cell adjacent to (5,5) on turn 51 from this path.\n\nFrom turn 50, if I move to (4,1) instead.\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2) move D to (4,1)  // at (4,1) on turn 50\n\nTurn 51: from (4,1) only move R to (5,1)  // at (5,1) on turn 51\n\nFrom (5,1), on turn 52, I can move to (5,2), (5,0) wall, (6,1), (4,1) body.\n\n(5,2) is free, so at (5,2) on turn 52, still not close to (5,5).\n\nNo way to reach (5,5) by turn 52, so I should abandon this food and focus on others.\n\nFood at (4,6) with life span 7, available until turn 55.\n\nAnd (2,2) with life span 10, until turn 58.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is under body, so I need to free it.\n\nFirst, on turn 49, only move is R to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 50, I have choices: move to (5,2) or to (4,1).\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, x=4.\n\nFrom current position, head at (4,2) on turn 50, I can go up.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I move to (5,2), then to (5,3), etc., but I can go towards (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,2), move to (4,1) is down, not helpful.\n\nMove to (5,2), then from there, I can move to (5,3) or (6,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to go north.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I could move up, but (4,3) is occupied, so I cannot.\n\nOn turn 50, from (4,2), move to (5,2), then on turn 51, from (5,2) move to (5,3), which is tail, so safe.\n\nThen on turn 51, at (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or (6,3) or (5,2) or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is body, so not.\n\n(5,4) is free, so move to (5,4) on turn 51.\n\nThen from (5,4), on turn 52, move to (5,5) but food gone, or (5,3), or (6,4), or (4,4).\n\n(4,4) might be free.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nAlso, food at (4,6), so from (5,4), I can move to (5,5) or (4,4) or (5,3) or (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is not wall, but in previous positions, (6,4) was tail, but now it's free.\n\nAfter various moves, let's assume.\n\nPerhaps I should create a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and (3,1).\n\nCells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is internal obstacle.\n\nSnake positions on turn 50 start: after turn 49 move, head at (4,2), body as listed.\n\nFree cells: all except snake and walls.\n\nFood at (5,5), (4,6), (2,2) but (2,2) occupied.\n\nNow for (4,6), I can plan to reach it.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I move to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nThen at (5,2), move U to (5,3) on turn 51 (since it's tail, safe).\n\nThen at (5,3), on turn 51, I can move U to (5,4) on turn 51? On turn 51, from (5,2) move to (5,3), at (5,3) for turn 52 start.\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,3) move U to (5,4).\n\nAt (5,4) for turn 53 start.\n\nThen on turn 53, from (5,4) move U to (5,5), but no food, or to (4,4) or (6,4) or (5,3).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nFrom (5,4), move L to (4,4) on turn 53.\n\nThen from (4,4), move U to (4,5) on turn 54.\n\nThen to (4,6) on turn 55.\n\n(4,6) food available until turn 55, so on turn 55 I can eat it.\n\nLife span 7 on turn 49, available turns 49 to 55, so on turn 55, I can eat if I move to it.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6).\n\nBut is (4,4) free? Currently not occupied, but need to check if it becomes occupied.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (2,2) to consider.\n\nBut first, let's see the other option on turn 50.\n\nIf on turn 50, from (4,2) I move D to (4,1), then to (5,1) on turn 51, then from (5,1) I can move to (5,2) or (6,1) or (5,0) wall, etc., which is south, away from (4,6), so not good for reaching food.\n\nSo better to move to (5,2) on turn 50 to go north.\n\nAlso, for the food at (2,2), it is under the body at position (2,2), which is segment.\n\nTo eat it, I need the cell to be free and head to move there.\n\nCurrently, on turn 50, after move to (4,2), the snake has (2,2) as index 2 or something.\n\nIn positions, (2,2) is occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, the segment at (2,2) will move to the next position.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, the body shifts.\n\nSuppose I continue moving east or north, the body at (2,2) might stay or move.\n\nBut (2,2) is part of the body, and when the snake moves, the segment that was at (2,2) moves to where the previous segment was.\n\nFor instance, if I move head to (5,2) on turn 50, then the segment at (2,2) moves to (1,2) or something? In the shift, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nIn the example above, after move to (5,2), the position (2,2) is still occupied by the same segment, but it is now at a different index, but the cell is occupied until the segment moves away.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by a segment may become free if no new segment comes.\n\nSpecifically for (2,2), in the current configuration, it is occupied by a body segment.\n\nAfter a move, that segment moves to a new cell, and (2,2) might be free if not reoccupied.\n\nFor example, on turn 50, after moving to (5,2), the new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), etc. so (2,2) is still occupied by the body.\n\nSimilarly, if I move again, the segment at (2,2) will move to the position of the previous segment, which is (1,2) in the list, so it moves to (1,2), and (2,2) is now free, because no new segment comes to it.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOn turn 50 start: positions (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nIndex 0: (4,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (1,2), 4: (1,3), etc.\n\nIf on turn 50, move R to (5,2): head to (5,2), new segment 1: (4,2), segment 2: (3,2), segment 3: (2,2), segment 4: (1,2), segment 5: (1,3), ..., so (2,2) is still occupied by segment 3.\n\nThen on turn 51, move U to (5,3): head to (5,3), new segment 1: (5,2), segment 2: (4,2), segment 3: (3,2), segment 4: (2,2), segment 5: (1,2), segment 6: (1,3), etc.\n\n(2,2) occupied by segment 4.\n\nOn turn 51, after move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (1,2), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (1,6), 10: (2,6), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,4), 13: (2,3), 14: (3,3), 15: (4,3) tail.\n\n(2,2) occupied.\n\nOn turn 52, from (5,3) move U to (5,4): head to (5,4), new segment 1: (5,3), segment 2: (5,2), segment 3: (4,2), segment 4: (3,2), segment 5: (2,2), etc.\n\n(2,2) still occupied.\n\nWhen will (2,2) be free? When the segment that is at (2,2) moves away and no other segment comes.\n\nFor example, when the snake moves, the segment at (2,2) will move to the position of the previous segment it was following.\n\nIn this case, the segment at (2,2) is following (3,2) or something.\n\nFrom the list, the segment at position k moves to the old position of segment k-1.\n\nBut for the cell (2,2), it will be free when the segment that was there moves to a new cell, and the cell is not the target of another segment.\n\nIn this path, the segment at (2,2) is moving to (1,2) eventually, but in the shifts, it stays at (2,2) for a while.\n\nLet's see when it moves.\n\nFor example, if on some turn, the head moves, and the segment that was at (2,2) is not the first, so it moves to the position of the segment before it.\n\nIn the initial position, segment at index 2 is at (2,2), and it follows index 1 at (3,2).\n\nWhen the snake moves, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, which is (3,2), but only if the head moves and the body shifts.\n\nSuppose on a turn, the head moves to a new position, then index 1 moves to old head position, index 2 moves to old index 1 position, and so on.\n\nSo for cell (2,2), if it was occupied by index k, after move, index k moves to old position of index k-1.\n\nSo the cell (2,2) is vacated, and if no other index moves to it, it is free.\n\nIn this case, for example, on turn 50, after move to (5,2), the old position of index 2 is (2,2), but index 3 moves to old index 2 position, which is (2,2), so (2,2) is reoccupied by index 3.\n\nSimilarly, on subsequent moves, the position (2,2) is always occupied because the segment that was there moves away, but the next segment moves in.\n\nIn this specific snake configuration, the body is such that (2,2) is always occupied until the tail part moves.\n\nNotice that the snake has a loop: from (2,2) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) to (2,6) to (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (3,3), etc.\n\nSo (2,2) is connected to (1,2) and (3,2).\n\nWhen the snake moves north, the segment at (2,2) will move to (3,2) if the head moves east, but in our case, we are moving the head away, so the body at (2,2) will eventually move to (1,2) or something.\n\nLet's fast forward.\n\nSuppose I keep moving the head east and north.\n\nFor example, after several moves, the tail will move, and the body will shift.\n\nSpecifically, when the segment that was at (1,2) moves, etc.\n\nBut it might take many moves to free (2,2).\n\nSince the food has long life, I can focus on (4,6) first.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with the food at (2,2) because of tail reward danger.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo if the head is next to the tail, and there is food on the tail cell, if I eat it, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on the tail cell, so they collide.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (2,2), which is not the tail; tail is at (6,3) or something.\n\nCurrently tail is at (6,3), far from head.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut if later the tail is near and there is food, I need to be careful.\n\nFor now, let's plan to eat (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nPath from turn 50.\n\nTurn 50: head at (4,2), move R to (5,2)  // better for north\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2) move U to (5,3)  // to (5,3)\n\nTurn 52: from (5,3) move U to (5,4)  // to (5,4)\n\nNow on turn 52, at (5,4), I can move to (4,4), (5,5), (6,4), or (5,3).\n\n(5,5) food gone, so not useful.\n\n(4,4) is free, let's assume.\n\nThen move to (4,4) on turn 52.\n\nThen turn 53: from (4,4) move U to (4,5)  // (4,5) should be free\n\nTurn 54: from (4,5) move U to (4,6)  // eat on turn 54? Turn 54 action move to (4,6), so eat on turn 54.\n\nBut food available until turn 55, so on turn 54 I can eat.\n\nLife span 7 on turn 49, available turns 49 to 55, so on turn 54, countdown=2 on turn 54? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 49: life span 7, countdown=7\n\nTurn 50: countdown=6\n\n...\n\nTurn 54: countdown=2\n\nTurn 55: countdown=1\n\nTurn 56: countdown=0, disappear\n\nSo available on turn 54, countdown=2, can be eaten.\n\nOn turn 55, countdown=1, can be eaten.\n\nOn turn 56, gone.\n\nSo eating on turn 54 or 55 is fine.\n\nIn the path, on turn 54 I move to (4,6) to eat.\n\nNow, on turn 52, after moving to (5,4), I move to (4,4) on turn 52.\n\nBut I need to check if (4,4) is safe.\n\nCurrently, on turn 52, after previous moves.\n\nLet's trace the snake positions.\n\nStart turn 50: positions as above.\n\nTurn 50 action: move R to (5,2), so new positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail\n\nTurn 51 action: move U to (5,3), head to (5,3), which was tail, so no eat, new positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail\n\nTurn 52 action: move U to (5,4), head to (5,4), new positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) tail\n\n(4,3) was tail, now gone.\n\nNow (3,3) tail.\n\n(5,4) is head.\n\nOn turn 52, from (5,4), I can move to (4,4), which should be free, not wall, not in positions.\n\nSo move to (4,4) on turn 52.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail? Old tail (3,3) moves to (3,2)? New segments: segment 1: old head (5,4), segment 2: old segment 1 (5,3), segment 3: old segment 2 (5,2), segment 4: old segment 3 (4,2), segment 5: old segment 4 (3,2), ..., up to segment 15: old segment 14 (2,3), and old segment 15 (3,3) gone, so tail is (2,3).\n\nPositions: head (4,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (2,2), 7: (1,2), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (1,6), 12: (2,6), 13: (2,5), 14: (2,4), 15: (2,3) tail.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by segment 6.\n\nNow on turn 53: from (4,4) move U to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) should be free.\n\nNew head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) tail? Old tail (2,3) gone, new tail (2,4).\n\nThen turn 54: from (4,5) move U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nHead to (4,6), which has food, so eat, snake grows.\n\nNew snake: head (4,6), then the body as before but tail not removed, so length increases by 1.\n\nPositions: head (4,6), segment 1: old head (4,5), segment 2: old segment 1 (4,4), ..., up to old tail (2,4), and new segment at the end, so the body has one more segment.\n\nBut we don't need the full list.\n\nNow, for turn 49 to 54, I have actions.\n\nBut turn 49 is given, I need to output from turn 49.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2)  // only choice\n\nThen for turn 50, I need to choose move.\n\nIn the path above, on turn 50 I moved R to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 51 U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 52 U to (5,4)\n\nBut on turn 52, I moved to (4,4), which is left.\n\nIn terms of direction, when I move from (5,4) to (4,4), it's left, so direction changes.\n\nBut no problem.\n\nNow, what about the food at (2,2)? It has long life, so I can go for it after.\n\nBut after eating (4,6), the snake is longer, and I can plan to free (2,2).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo for turn 49,50,51,52,53,54 at least.\n\nTurn 49 is given, I need to output action for turn 49 and beyond.\n\nIn the state, turn t1=49, so I output from turn 49.\n\nAlso, for turn 49, action is R, as only choice.\n\nThen turn 50: in my plan, I move R to (5,2)\n\nBut is there a better move? I could move D to (4,1), but that seems worse, as it goes south.\n\nSo R is better.\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2) move U to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 52: from (5,3) move U to (5,4)\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,4) I need to move to (4,4) for the path to (4,6).\n\nBut on turn 52, from (5,4), I could move to other places, but to reach (4,6), moving to (4,4) is good.\n\nThen turn 53: from (4,4) move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 54: from (4,5) move U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,2), I can consider later, but for 5 turns, up to turn 54.\n\nTurn 49 to 54 is 6 actions: 49,50,51,52,53,54.\n\nt1=49, so turns 49,50,51,52,53,54.\n\nIn the path, on turn 54 I eat (4,6).\n\nBut I need to output actions only, not the eating.\n\nAlso, on turn 49, I don't eat, turn 50 no, etc.\n\nBut in the plan, it seems fine.\n\nTo include the (2,2) food, but it might not be possible in 5 turns.\n\nFor example, to free (2,2), I need the body to move away.\n\nCurrently, in the snake, (2,2) is occupied, and as I move, it might take time.\n\nFor instance, after eating (4,6), the snake is longer, and I can maneuver to free the area.\n\nBut for now, the plan to eat (4,6) by turn 54 is good.\n\nOn turn 50, if I move to (4,1), it might be worse.\n\nSo I think the sequence is:\n\nTurn 49: R (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 50: R (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 51: U (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 52: U (to (5,4))\n\nThen from (5,4), on turn 52, move to (4,4), which is L (left).\n\nThen turn 53: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 54: U to (4,6)\n\nNow, directions: from (5,4) to (4,4) is left, so action L.\n\nCurrent direction at turn 52 start: after turn 51 move U to (5,3), then on turn 52 move U to (5,4), so direction is U (up).\n\nThen from (5,4) to (4,4), moving left, which is not opposite to up, so allowed. Opposite of up is down, left is perpendicular, ok.\n\nThen from (4,4) to (4,5) up, same direction.\n\nThen to (4,6) up.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nAfter move, head at (4,2), direction R\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2), direction R\n\nTurn 51: move U to (5,3), now direction U\n\nTurn 52: move U to (5,4), direction U\n\nTurn 53: move L to (4,4)? From (5,4) to (4,4) is left, so action L.\n\nBut current direction is U, so moving left is allowed, not opposite.\n\nThen after move to (4,4), direction is L (left)\n\nThen turn 54: move U to (4,5), but from (4,4) to (4,5) is up, which is perpendicular to current direction L, so allowed.\n\nThen direction U.\n\nThen to (4,6) U.\n\nBut turn 54 action U to (4,6).\n\nIn the answer, I need to output for each turn.\n\nBut for turn 53, I have move to (4,4), but (4,4) is not food, only on turn 54 I eat.\n\nThe actions are fine.\n\nI could output more turns, but 5+ turns, so up to turn 54 is 6 turns, including turn 49.\n\nt1 to t1+5 is 6 turns.\n\nt1=49, turns 49,50,51,52,53,54.\n\nNow, but on turn 52, when I move to (5,4), is (4,4) free? In the positions, after turn 52 move to (5,4), positions include (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc., (4,4) not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) free, (4,6) has food.\n\nAlso, no walls or obstacles.\n\nSo safe.\n\nFor the food at (2,2), it is still under body, but with life span 10, I can go for it later after turn 54.\n\nBut for the answer, I think this sequence is good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: L  // to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: U  // to (4,5)? Turn 53: to (4,4), then turn 54: to (4,5), but to reach (4,6) on turn 54, from (4,4) to (4,5) on turn 53, then to (4,6) on turn 54.\n\nIn my earlier:\n\nTurn 52: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 53: to (4,4)  // L from (5,4)\n\nTurn 54: to (4,5)  // U from (4,4) to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55: to (4,6) to eat, but I can eat on turn 54 if I go directly, but from (4,4) to (4,6) not adjacent.\n\nSo need turn 54 to (4,5), then turn 55 to (4,6).\n\nBut food available on turn 55, so I can eat on turn 55.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 52 at (5,4)\n\nTurn 53: move to (4,4) action L\n\nAt (4,4) for turn 54\n\nTurn 54: move to (4,5) action U\n\nAt (4,5) for turn 55\n\nTurn 55: move to (4,6) action U to eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output up to where? 5+ turns, so I can output to turn 54, or more.\n\nSince eating on turn 55, I might include turn 55.\n\nBut let's see the minimum.\n\nTurn 49 to 53 is 5 turns: 49,50,51,52,53.\n\nBut on turn 53 I am at (4,4), not eaten yet.\n\nTo include the eating, I can output to turn 55.\n\nBut the answer format can have multiple lines.\n\nPerhaps output for turns 49 to 54.\n\nIn turn 54 I am at (4,5), not eaten.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo save, I can output fewer, but 5+ turns, so at least to turn 54.\n\nt1=49, t1+5=54, so 6 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 54 action is U to (4,5).\n\nThen for turn 55, I can omit.\n\nBut in the plan, I need to think ahead.\n\nSince the question is to output actions, and I have a plan.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 51, when I move U to (5,3), it was tail, but no food, so ok.\n\nNow for the food at (2,2), after this, I can plan to free it.\n\nFor example, by moving the snake, the body at (2,2) will eventually move.\n\nBut not necessary for now.\n\nSo I think the sequence is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: L  // from (5,4) to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: U  // from (4,4) to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55: U to (4,6) to eat, but not in output.\n\nBut since I output to turn 54, it's ok.\n\nTo be complete, I can output to turn 55.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn the answer format, I should output for the turns requested, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so output multiple actions.\n\nI think output from turn 49 to turn 54 is fine.\n\nNow, write in boxed.\n\nBut on turn 53, action L from (5,4) to (4,4), and direction was U, so moving left is fine.\n\nSimilarly, turn 54 U to (4,5).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the actions:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the plan prioritizes reaching and eating the positive food at (4,6) by turn 55, as it has a life span of 7 and is accessible. The food at (5,5) is ignored because it cannot be reached by its last available turn (turn 52) from the starting position. The food at (2,2) is under the snake's body and has a long life span (until turn 58), so it can be targeted later after freeing the cell. The sequence avoids collisions and walls, and leverages the snake's movement to position for the (4,6) food.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 49 (Current State)**: Only possible safe move is right (R) to (4,2), as up (U) leads to body collision at (3,3), down (D) leads to wall at (3,1), and left (L) is opposite to current direction (R) and would cause collision.\n- **Path to (4,6)**: \n  - From turn 50, move right (R) to (5,2) to start heading north.\n  - Then move up (U) to (5,3) on turn 51 (safe as it moves to the tail position).\n  - Move up (U) to (5,4) on turn 52.\n  - Move left (L) to (4,4) on turn 53 to align for the food.\n  - Move up (U) to (4,5) on turn 54.\n  - Finally, move up (U) to (4,6) on turn 55 to eat the food (available until turn 55).\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: The plan covers turns 49 to 54 (6 turns), with turn 55 completing the eat. Thinking beyond, after eating (4,6), the snake can focus on freeing and eating (2,2) by maneuvering the body away.\n- **Risks Avoided**: No negative food present. Tail reward danger is not a concern here, as the tail is not adjacent to the head during the plan. All moves are validated for collisions and direction constraints.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 49: R (right) to (4,2) – only safe move.\n- Turn 50: R (right) to (5,2) – positions for north movement.\n- Turn 51: U (up) to (5,3) – safe tail move.\n- Turn 52: U (up) to (5,4) – continues north.\n- Turn 53: L (left) to (4,4) – aligns for (4,6) approach.\n- Turn 54: U (up) to (4,5) – final step before eating.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 49: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 50: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 51: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 52: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 53: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 54: U (up)\n}",

        "step": 50,
        "score": 15,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 50. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (4,2), and it's moving right (R). The body segments are listed: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]. That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (5,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (4,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (2,2) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1 each. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but I need to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n\nLife span: (5,5) disappears after 3 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 50, it will disappear after turn 52? Let me clarify the life span countdown.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (5,5) with life span 3, it was placed or appeared at some turn, and on turn 50, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn 50, life span is 3, so after turn 50, it becomes 2; after turn 51, it becomes 1; after turn 52, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 50, 51, or 52.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) has life span 6, so disappears after turn 55? Let's not get into absolute turns; I should think in terms of remaining life.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know how many turns I have.\n\nCurrent turn: 50\n\nFood (5,5): life span 3, so available until turn 52 (inclusive). Turn 50: life=3, turn 51: life=2, turn 52: life=1, turn 53: life=0, gone. So last chance to eat is turn 52.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life span 6, available until turn 55.\n\n(2,2): life span 9, available until turn 58.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,2), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: Since head is moving right, I can go U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so opposite is L, which is not allowed. So possible moves from (4,2): right to (5,2), up to (4,3), down to (4,1). But (4,1): let's check if it's valid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls. (4,1): y=1, not y=0, so no wall. But internal obstacle at (3,1), which is not (4,1), so (4,1) should be free.\n\nBut let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: let's list them to see what's occupied.\n\nHead: (4,2)\n\nBody: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nNow, (2,2) is a body segment, and there's food at (2,2) with value 1. But (2,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body, specifically the third segment.\n\nFood at (2,2) is under the snake's body. According to rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, other cells: I need to know where I can move without dying.\n\nFirst, from head position (4,2), possible next positions:\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nLeft to (3,2) is not possible because (3,2) is the second segment, and moving left would cause collision? Let's see.\n\n(3,2) is the neck, directly behind head. If I move left to (3,2), that's where the neck is, but after moving, the snake moves, so the neck will move forward.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its current cell, unless you eat food, in which case tail doesn't move.\n\nBut collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it's collision, except if it's the current tail position, because tail moves away.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt current state, snake positions: head at (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), etc. up to tail at (6,3).\n\nIf I move to a cell, say, to (5,2). After move, head moves to (5,2), and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves off (6,3) to (5,3)? Let's simulate.\n\nAfter one move, the new positions depend on the direction and whether food is eaten.\n\nBut for collision check, when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's a collision. Because after moving, that body segment will still be there, except the tail cell, which will be vacated when tail moves.\n\nStandard Snake rules: when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the cell is free, then head moves there, and tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is now free.\n\n- If the cell has food, head moves there, tail does not move, so snake grows.\n\n- If the cell is occupied by body or wall, collision, die.\n\nBut specifically, moving to the current tail position is safe because after moving, tail moves away, so that cell is no longer occupied.\n\nIn this case, current tail is (6,3).\n\nNow, from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- Right to (5,2): what is (5,2)? Looking at snake positions, (5,2) is not listed. Positions are: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (5,2) is not occupied, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, up to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied, it's the 14th segment? Let's count: head (4,2) index 0, (3,2) index 1, (2,2) index 2, (1,2) index 3, (1,3) index 4, (1,4) index 5, (1,5) index 6, (1,6) index 7, (2,6) index 8, (2,5) index 9, (2,4) index 10, (2,3) index 11, (3,3) index 12, (4,3) index 13, (5,3) index 14, (6,3) index 15 tail.\n\nSo (4,3) is index 13, which is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (6,3).\n\nIf I move up to (4,3), that cell is currently occupied by a body segment (index 13), which is not the tail, so moving there would cause collision because after move, that segment will still be there when head arrives? At the moment of move, head moves to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, down to (4,1): (4,1) is not in the snake positions, so should be free, but check walls.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1): x=4 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border. Internal obstacle at (3,1), which is different, so (4,1) should be empty and safe.\n\nLeft to (3,2): (3,2) is currently the second segment, index 1. Not tail, so moving left would be to a body-occupied cell, collision.\n\nAlso, cannot move left because it's opposite direction? Current direction is R, so moving L is instant reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,2):\n\n- Right (R) to (5,2): empty, safe\n\n- Up (U) to (4,3): occupied by body, unsafe\n\n- Down (D) to (4,1): empty, safe\n\nDown to (4,1) is possible.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (5,5) with life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 52 (since turn 50: life=3, eat on 50,51,52; gone on 53)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 6, eat by turn 55\n\n- (2,2) with life span 9, eat by turn 58\n\nBut (2,2) is currently occupied by the snake body at index 2. So to eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away from (2,2), and then head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, the body segment at (2,2) will move when the snake moves, depending on the direction.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (5,5) and (4,6) are free, I think.\n\n(5,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,3) is there, but (5,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(4,6): not listed, free.\n\n(2,2): occupied by body.\n\nNow, head at (4,2), I need to plan moves.\n\nFirst, immediate options: move R to (5,2), D to (4,1), or U to (4,3) but U is unsafe, so only R or D.\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), then new head position (5,2), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can go R to (6,2), U to (5,3), or D to (5,1), but (5,3) is occupied by index 14, body segment, so moving U to (5,3) would be collision? (5,3) is index 14, not tail.\n\nTail is (6,3), so (5,3) is not tail, so moving to (5,3) from (5,2) would be unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,1): should be free, walls ok.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) not occupied, walls: x=6<7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so ok.\n\nBut (6,3) is tail, but (6,2) is different.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), the snake positions: head to (5,2), then segments shift, so (4,2) becomes new neck, then (3,2), etc., and tail (6,3) moves to (5,3)? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) ]\n\nIf head moves right to (5,2), and no food eaten, so tail moves off (6,3), new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — and tail was (6,3), but since no eat, tail moves to (5,3)? After move, the body segments: the old head (4,2) becomes new position 1, old position 1 (3,2) becomes position 2, ..., old position 14 (5,3) becomes position 15, old position 15 (6,3) is removed since no growth.\n\nSo new snake: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — so tail is (5,3) now.\n\n(5,3) is now tail.\n\nIf from (5,2), I move up to (5,3), which is now the tail, so it should be safe because tail will move away.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), if no food, tail moves, but if I eat food, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut (5,3) has food? Currently, food is at (5,5), (4,6), (2,2), no food at (5,3), so moving to (5,3) would not eat food, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut back to turn 50.\n\nOption 1: move R to (5,2)\n\nThen at (5,2), I can:\n\n- R to (6,2): free\n\n- U to (5,3): now tail, safe\n\n- D to (5,1): free\n\nIf I go U to (5,3), since it's tail, no collision, and no food, so snake moves, tail moves to (4,3) or something.\n\nNew positions after move to (5,2): as above.\n\nThen if move U to (5,3): head to (5,3), which was tail, so no collision, and since no food there, tail moves off, new tail is the previous position 14, which was (4,3) in new list? After first move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), ..., (5,3) at end.\n\nList indices after move to (5,2): [ (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ]\n\nThen move U to (5,3): (5,3) is the current tail, so head moves to (5,3), and since no food, the tail is removed, so new positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), ..., up to (4,3), and (5,3) was tail, removed, so the segment before that is (4,3) which becomes new tail? Positions: after moving to (5,3), the new head is (5,3), then the body is (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — so tail is (4,3).\n\n(5,3) was occupied, but since it was tail, it's ok.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) is close, but not eaten yet.\n\nOption 2 from (4,2): move down to (4,1)\n\nThen head at (4,1), direction down.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: L to (3,1), R to (5,1), U to (4,2), or D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so D invalid.\n\nU to (4,2): but (4,2) is now the neck after move? After moving down to (4,1), new positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), ..., up to tail (6,3) shifted.\n\nCurrent: [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), ... (6,3) ]\n\nMove D to (4,1): no food, so new positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (6,3) removed, so new tail is (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is now position 1, the neck.\n\nIf from (4,1) I move U to (4,2), which is the neck, so occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, L to (3,1): (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nR to (5,1): (5,1) not occupied, walls ok, so possible.\n\nD to (4,0) invalid.\n\nSo from (4,1), only possible move is R to (5,1), since U and L are invalid, D wall.\n\nU to (4,2) is invalid because it's body, L to (3,1) wall, D wall, so only R to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go to (6,1), (5,2), (5,0) but y=0 wall, so (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut (5,2) might be occupied or not, depending.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), etc., tail (5,3) shifted.\n\nNew positions after move to (4,1): [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ]\n\nThen from (4,1) move R to (5,1): no food, so new head (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), ..., (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3) removed, new tail (4,3)? Positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] tail (4,3)\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- R to (6,1): free\n\n- U to (5,2): (5,2) is now position 2 in the list? After above, positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), etc. so (5,2) not occupied, it was in previous but not now. Current positions: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), ... (4,3) so (5,2) is free.\n\nU to (5,2): free\n\nD to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid\n\nL to (4,1): but (4,1) is position 1, neck, body occupied, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo from (5,1), can go R to (6,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nBut this seems messy, and I'm not closer to food.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) is at y=5, x=5, head at (4,2), so I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) at y=6, (2,2) at y=2 but occupied.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by body, and it has food, so I need to free it up.\n\nCurrently at turn 50, snake has segment at (2,2), which has food under it.\n\nTo eat that food, I need the body to move away from (2,2), and then head to move to (2,2).\n\nThe body at (2,2) will move when the snake moves, but it depends on the direction the snake is going.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) is index 2, so it will move to where index 1 was when the head moves.\n\nBut index 1 is (3,2), so if head moves, (2,2) will move to (3,2) if the neck moves, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the snake's path.\n\nThe snake is currently on row 2 from x=1 to x=4, but with segments at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) head.\n\nThen it goes up to (1,3) to (1,6), then right to (2,6), down to (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), then to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).\n\nSo the tail is at (6,3), and the body is dense around (2,2) to (2,3) etc.\n\nFood at (2,2) is under the body, so to eat it, I need the snake to move so that the body leaves (2,2), and then head comes back.\n\nFor example, if I move the head away, the body will follow, so (2,2) will be vacated after some moves.\n\nCurrently, if I move head to (5,2) or (4,1), the body at (2,2) will eventually move.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nLet's think about the food with short life span.\n\n(5,5) has only 3 turns left, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nDistance from head (4,2) to (5,5): delta x=1, delta y=3, so Manhattan distance 4, so at least 4 moves to reach, but with obstacles.\n\nDirect path: from (4,2) to (5,2) then to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied, but after moving, it might be free.\n\nAt turn 50, head at (4,2).\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), turn 51 head at (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move U to (5,3), which at that point might be tail or something.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) at turn 51, positions: as before, head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), ..., (5,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) is tail, so moving U to (5,3) is safe, no food, so snake moves, tail moves off.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), head at (5,3), then body (5,2), (4,2), etc., tail (4,3) or something.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), which should be free.\n\nThen to (5,5) to eat food at (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) has life span 3, available on turn 50,51,52.\n\nTurn 50: move to (5,2) or (4,1)\n\nIf I go to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2) move U to (5,3) — safe, since it was tail.\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: after move to (5,3), head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (4,3)? After moving to (5,3), since no eat, tail (5,3) was removed, so body is (5,2), (4,2), ..., up to (4,3), so tail is (4,3).\n\nYes.\n\nNow from (5,3), move U to (5,4): (5,4) not occupied, free.\n\nTurn 52: head at (5,4), then I can move U to (5,5) to eat food.\n\n(5,5) is food with value 1, so eat, snake grows, tail doesn't move.\n\nLife span: on turn 50, (5,5) life=3, turn 51 life=2, turn 52 life=1, so on turn 52 it can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sequence for eating (5,5):\n\nTurn 50: R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 52: U to (5,4)? No, from (5,3) to (5,4), then turn 53 to (5,5)? But on turn 52, I can move directly to (5,5) from (5,4)? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 50: move to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move to (5,3) — at this point, head at (5,3)\n\nThen on turn 51, after move, head is at (5,3), so for turn 52, from (5,3) I can move U to (5,4), or directly to (5,5)? No, each move is one cell, so from (5,3) to (5,4) or (6,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\n(5,5) is at y=5, so from (5,3) to (5,4) then to (5,5).\n\nSo turn 52: move to (5,4)\n\nTurn 53: move to (5,5) to eat.\n\nBut (5,5) life span: turn 50 life=3, turn 51 life=2, turn 52 life=1, turn 53 life=0, gone. So on turn 53, it disappears, so I can only eat on turn 52 or earlier.\n\nTurn 52: if head is at (5,4), I move to (5,5) on turn 53, but turn 53 it's gone, so I miss it.\n\nProblem: I need to be at (5,5) on turn 52 to eat it.\n\nOn turn 52, head must be at (5,5).\n\nBut from turn 50, head at (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: move to (5,2) — turn 51 head (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move to (5,3) — turn 52 head (5,3)\n\nFrom (5,3), to reach (5,5) I need two moves: to (5,4) on turn 52, then (5,5) on turn 53, too late.\n\nIf from (5,2) on turn 51, I go directly to (5,4)? No, can only move one cell per turn.\n\nUnless I go diagonally, but no, only up, down, left, right.\n\nSo from (5,2) on turn 51, I can only go to adjacent cells: (6,2), (5,3), (5,1), not (5,4).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,5) by turn 52 from (4,2) with only two moves; minimum three moves: e.g., (4,2)->(5,2)->(5,3)->(5,4) by turn 52, then (5,5) on turn 53, but food gone.\n\n(4,2) to (5,5) is |dx|=1, |dy|=3, min moves 4, since Manhattan distance.\n\n|dx| = |5-4| =1, |dy| = |5-2| =3, total 4 moves.\n\nSo from turn 50 position, to eat on turn 52, I need to be there on turn 52, so I must start moving earlier, but I can't, because turn 50 is the first move.\n\nTurn 50: move from (4,2) to somewhere.\n\nAfter move on turn 50, head at new position on turn 51? The state is given at turn 50 before move.\n\nTurn 50: I choose action, which moves the head to a new cell for turn 51? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nThe problem says: \"Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\" and state at turn t_1 before action.\n\nIn the input: \"Current turn: t1 = 50\" so at turn 50, before move.\n\nAfter I choose action, the head moves to the new cell, and that becomes the state for turn 51.\n\nSimilarly, food life span decreases after each turn, including after turn 50 action.\n\nLife span countdown decreases every turn, including current turn.\n\nSo for food at (5,5), life span 3 at turn 50.\n\nAfter turn 50 action, life span decreases to 2, and so on.\n\nThe food can be eaten when the head moves onto it during a move.\n\nTo eat on turn t, I move onto it on turn t action.\n\nFor (5,5), it can be eaten on action turn 50, 51, or 52.\n\nOn turn 52 action, if head moves to (5,5), it can be eaten, since life span >0 before decrease? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 50, before action, life span=3.\n\nAfter action turn 50, life span decreases to 2.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 51 action, to 1.\n\nAfter turn 52 action, to 0, and disappears.\n\nIf on turn 52 action, I move to (5,5), at that moment, life span is still 1 before decrease, so I can eat it, then after eat, life span decreases to 0.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 50 or 51.\n\nBut on turn 53, it's gone, cannot eat.\n\nTo eat (5,5), I must have head at (5,5) on action turn 50, 51, or 52.\n\nFrom (4,2) at turn 50, I can reach (5,5) in 3 moves: e.g., (4,2)->(4,3)->(4,4)->(5,4) but not (5,5), or (5,2)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(5,5) on turn 53, too late.\n\nMinimum moves: from (4,2) to (5,5) is 4 moves: e.g., (4,2)->(5,2)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(5,5) or (4,2)->(4,3)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(5,5) etc, all take 4 moves to reach (5,5).\n\nSo on turn 50, after move, head at new cell turn 51.\n\nTurn 51 after move, head at another, turn 52 at another, turn 53 at (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 53, food is gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (5,5) because I cannot reach it in 2 or 3 moves from current position with the path available.\n\n2 moves: from (4,2) turn 50 move, to say (5,2) on turn 51, then turn 51 move to (5,3) or (5,4)? Cannot reach (5,5) in one move from there.\n\nFrom (4,2), in two moves, I can be at (5,3) if I go right then up, but (5,3) is not (5,5).\n\n(5,3) to (5,5) is two more moves.\n\nSo yes, impossible to reach (5,5) by turn 52 for eating.\n\nSince life span 3 at turn 50, I need to eat by turn 52, but I can only reach on turn 53 at earliest.\n\nUnless there is a shorter path.\n\nFor example, if I could go directly, but no.\n\nFrom (4,2), move up to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied, so I cannot move there, it's lethal.\n\nMove down to (4,1), then to (5,1), etc, even farther.\n\nSo indeed, I cannot eat (5,5) at all; it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, for other food.\n\n(5,5) is lost.\n\nNow, food at (4,6) with life span 6, so available until turn 55.\n\nLife span 6 at turn 50, so after turn 50 action, life=5, turn 51 life=4, ..., after turn 55 action, life=0, gone. So can eat on turns 50 to 55 inclusive? Turn 50: before action life=3 for (5,5), but for (4,6) life=6.\n\nAt turn t, before action, life span as given.\n\nAfter action, it decreases.\n\nCan eat when moving onto it during action.\n\nSo for (4,6), life span 6 at turn 50, can be eaten on action turn 50,51,52,53,54,55.\n\nAfter turn 55 action, life=0, gone.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2), life span 9 at turn 50, eat by turn 58.\n\nNow, (4,6) is at (4,6), head at (4,2), distance |dy|=4, |dx=0|, so Manhattan 4, can reach in 4 moves.\n\nBut with obstacles or body in way.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is occupied, but can be eaten later.\n\nBut there is a danger with tail reward.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from current.\n\nAt turn 50, from (4,2), move R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), I go to the bottom, which might be dead end, as earlier, only way out is to (5,1), then to (6,1) or (5,2), but (5,2) might be occupied later.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nGrid size 8x8, walls at borders, obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake occupies many cells.\n\nFree cells: let's list all cells not wall or snake.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,1)\n\nSnake positions: from (1,2) to (4,2) on row 2, then (1,3) to (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\nSo occupied: row 2: x=1,2,3,4 y=2\n\nRow 3: x=1 y=3, x=2 y=3, x=3 y=3, x=4 y=3, x=5 y=3, x=6 y=3? (6,3) is tail.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, (3,3), etc.\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,y) wall, (7,y) wall, (x,0) wall, (x,7) wall.\n\nSo within, row 0 and 7 all wall, row 1: y=1, x from 1 to 6 except (3,1) obstacle.\n\n(3,1) is wall, so (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) free? But y=1, not wall except borders.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so for y=1, cells (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are free, (3,1) wall.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: occupied by snake x=1,2,3,4 y=2, so (5,2), (6,2) free.\n\n(0,2) wall, (7,2) wall.\n\nRow 3: occupied x=1,2,3,4,5,6 y=3? (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) all occupied by snake.\n\nRow 4: (1,4) occupied, (2,4) occupied, (3,4)? Not listed, so free. (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) free. But (1,4) occupied, (2,4) occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (1,4), (2,4) are occupied, so row 4: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) free, (0,4) wall, (7,4) wall.\n\nSimilarly, row 5: (1,5) occupied, (2,5) occupied, (3,5) free, (4,5) free, (5,5) food, (6,5) free.\n\n(5,5) is food, not occupied.\n\nRow 6: (1,6) occupied, (2,6) occupied, (3,6) free, (4,6) food, (5,6) free, (6,6) free.\n\nRow 7 all wall.\n\nAlso, row 1 as above.\n\nSo free cells include (5,2), (6,2), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), and row 1 cells.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nSince (5,5) is impossible to eat, I should focus on other food.\n\n(4,6) at (4,6), life span 6, so I have time.\n\n(2,2) at (2,2) with food under body, life span 9, plenty of time.\n\nBut to eat (2,2), I need to free the cell.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is occupied by body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, that segment will move away.\n\nFor example, if I move the head to the right or down, the body will follow, so after some moves, (2,2) will be vacated.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (2,2) is index 2 in the list.\n\nWhen the head moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo after one move, if no growth, the tail moves off, and each segment advances.\n\nAfter one move, the segment that was at (2,2) will move to where the previous index 1 was, which is (3,2) if head moved.\n\nBut let's say I move head to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nAfter move, head at (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) still there, but shifted to position 3, but cell (2,2) is still occupied until the tail moves.\n\nAfter move to (5,2), the snake occupies (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc., so (2,2) is still occupied.\n\nThe food at (2,2) is under the body, so to eat it, the body must move away, meaning that the snake moves so that no segment is at (2,2), and then head moves to it.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment at (2,2) moves to a different cell.\n\nSince the snake is moving, eventually if I go away, (2,2) will be free.\n\nBut it depends on the path.\n\nThe body at (2,2) will move when the snake moves, but only if the head moves and the chain reaction.\n\nAfter the head moves, the next segment moves to the old head position, and so on.\n\nSo after one move, the segment that was at index 1 moves to old head position, index 2 moves to old index 1 position, etc.\n\nFor cell (2,2), it is occupied by whatever segment is there after moves.\n\nTo vacate (2,2), I need the segment currently at (2,2) to move to a different cell, and no other segment to move to (2,2) immediately.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I can move the head in a circle or something to free the cell faster.\n\nBut let's first decide the immediate move.\n\nAnother option: since the tail is at (6,3), and I can move towards the food at (4,6).\n\nHead at (4,2), (4,6) is directly above, same x, dy=4.\n\nI can go up, but from (4,2), I cannot go up because (4,3) is occupied.\n\nSo I need to go around.\n\nFor example, move right to (5,2), then up to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied, but after moving to (5,2), (5,3) is tail, so I can move to it safely on turn 51.\n\nThen from there to (5,4), (5,5), but (5,5) is food, but I can't eat it, so I can go to (5,4), then to (4,4) or (6,4), etc.\n\nBut let's think about (4,6).\n\nFrom head, I can go to (5,2), then to (5,3) on turn 51 (safe), then to (5,4) on turn 52, then to (5,5) on turn 53 but food gone, so better to go to (4,4) or something.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go to (4,4) or (5,5) or (6,4) or (5,3).\n\n(4,4) is free, then from (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6) to eat.\n\n(4,5) is free, (4,6) is food.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move U to (5,3)  -- safe, no eat\n\nTurn 52: move U to (5,4)  -- free, no eat\n\nTurn 53: move L to (4,4)  -- free, no eat\n\nTurn 54: move U to (4,5)  -- free, no eat\n\nTurn 55: move U to (4,6)  -- eat food, since life span on turn 55 before action is at least 1? Let's check life span.\n\n(4,6) life span 6 at turn 50.\n\nAfter turn 50 action, life=5\n\nAfter turn 51, life=4\n\nAfter turn 52, life=3\n\nAfter turn 53, life=2\n\nAfter turn 54, life=1\n\nAfter turn 55 action, life=0, gone.\n\nOn turn 55 action, if I move to (4,6), at that moment, life span is 1 before decrease, so I can eat it.\n\nYes, on turn 55 I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I can reach earlier, but this works.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (2,2)?\n\nIt has life span 9, so available until turn 58.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), the snake will grow, so it will be longer.\n\nBut I can plan to eat (2,2) later.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the path.\n\nFrom current, turn 50: move R to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2), move U to (5,3) -- which is safe, as it was tail.\n\nThen turn 52: from (5,3), move U to (5,4) -- free\n\nTurn 53: from (5,4), move L to (4,4) -- free\n\nTurn 54: from (4,4), move U to (4,5) -- free\n\nTurn 55: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) -- eat food\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases.\n\nNow, during this, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nAlso, on turn 53, moving to (4,4), is it safe? At that point, the snake body might be there, but let's simulate the snake positions roughly.\n\nAfter turn 50: move R to (5,2), no eat, so new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail\n\nAfter turn 51: move U to (5,3), no eat (no food there), so head to (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail\n\nAfter turn 52: move U to (5,4), no eat, head to (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) tail\n\nAfter turn 53: move L to (4,4), no eat (assuming no food), head to (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail? Positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) -- tail should be (2,3)? From previous, after turn 52, tail was (3,3), but after move to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) -- (2,3) is position 14, tail? Indices: after turn 52: positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ] so tail (2,3)\n\nThen move L to (4,4): from (5,4) to (4,4), which is adjacent, yes. (4,4) is free, no food mentioned, so no eat. New positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) -- tail (2,3) removed, so new tail (2,4)\n\nAfter turn 54: move U to (4,5), head to (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail\n\nAfter turn 55: move U to (4,6), head to (4,6), which has food, so eat, grow, tail does not move. New positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) and tail stays, so snake longer.\n\n(2,5) was tail, now not moved, so it becomes part of body.\n\nNow, all seems safe.\n\nBut we have food at (2,2) to consider.\n\n(2,2) has food under it, but currently occupied by body.\n\nAfter several moves, in the sequence above, at turn 53, (2,2) is still occupied, e.g., in turn 53 positions, (2,2) is occupied by body.\n\nAs we move, the body at (2,2) moves away slowly.\n\nFor example, in turn 54 positions, (2,2) is still there.\n\nIn turn 55, after eating (4,6), (2,2) might still be occupied or not.\n\nBut to eat (2,2), I need to have head move to it when it's free.\n\nCurrently, with the path to (4,6), I am moving away, so (2,2) will be free when the tail passes, but tail is moving.\n\nSince the snake is long, and I'm moving up, the tail will follow, so eventually (2,2) will be free.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\n(2,2) life span 9, so after turn 50, available until turn 58.\n\nAfter turn 58 action, life=0.\n\nCan eat on turn 58.\n\nIn the current plan, by turn 55, I eat (4,6), then I can turn back to eat (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is at bottom left, while I'm at top.\n\nAfter turn 55, head at (4,6), I need to go to (2,2), which is far.\n\nManhattan distance |4-2|=2, |6-2|=4, total 6, so 6 moves.\n\nBut from turn 55, I have until turn 58 to eat, so 4 actions: turn 55,56,57,58.\n\nTurn 55 I am at (4,6) after eating, so for turn 56,57,58,59? Turn 55: after action, I am at (4,6).\n\nThen turn 56: I can move from (4,6) to somewhere.\n\nTo reach (2,2) in 3 moves: from (4,6) to (4,5) to (4,4) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2), takes more than 3.\n\nMinimum 4 moves: e.g., (4,6)->(4,5)->(4,4)->(3,4)->(2,4) but not (2,2).\n\n(2,4) to (2,2) is 2 more moves.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (2,2) |dx|=2, |dy|=4, min 6 moves.\n\nSo from turn 56 to turn 58, I can move 3 times, reach in 3 moves to, say, (3,4) or something, not (2,2).\n\nOn turn 58, I can be at (2,2) only if I start from closer.\n\nBut at turn 55, I'm at (4,6), so on turn 56 move, turn 57 move, turn 58 move, I can be at a cell within 3 moves, but (2,2) is 6 away, so impossible to reach by turn 58.\n\nTurn 56,57,58: three actions, max 3 moves away.\n\nFrom (4,6), in three moves, I can be at (4,3) or (2,6), etc, but (2,2) is too far.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (2,2) if I go for (4,6) first.\n\nBut I have another choice at turn 50: move down to (4,1).\n\nThen I might be able to free (2,2) faster.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (4,1) on turn 50.\n\nThen as earlier, only can move right to (5,1) on turn 51.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can move right to (6,1) or up to (5,2).\n\nSay move up to (5,2) on turn 52.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut (2,2) might be freed earlier.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,1) on turn 50, positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), etc., tail (5,3) or something.\n\n(2,2) still occupied.\n\nThen move right to (5,1) on turn 51: head (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n\n(2,2) occupied.\n\nThen if move up to (5,2) on turn 52: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n\nStill occupied.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) is moving slowly.\n\nTo free (2,2), I need the snake to move so that the body leaves it.\n\nFor example, if I can make the snake turn, but it's fixed.\n\nSince the snake is moving, after several moves, when the tail passes (2,2), it will be free, but tail is at (6,3), far.\n\nIn the original position, the tail is at (6,3), and (2,2) is near the head, so as I move away, (2,2) will be vacated when the segment moves.\n\nBut the time to vacate depends on how I move.\n\nIf I move in a way that the snake shortens the path or something, but no growth.\n\nPerhaps I should go directly to free (2,2).\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I could move left, but I can't, occupied and reverse.\n\nMove down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), then right to (6,1), then up to (6,2), etc., but not helping.\n\nNotice that (2,2) is occupied, but the food can be eaten only when head moves to it after it's free.\n\nThe fastest way might be to keep moving so that the body segment at (2,2) moves away.\n\nBut in the sequence to (4,6), by turn 55, (2,2) might be free.\n\nLet's estimate.\n\nIn the first plan, after turn 55, when I am at (4,6), the tail is at (2,5) or something, but (2,2) is still occupied because the snake body is long and moving slowly.\n\nFor example, from the positions after turn 55: head (4,6), body (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nAs I move from (4,6), if I go down, the body will follow, so (2,2) will eventually be free when the tail passes, but tail is at (2,5), so it will take time.\n\nFor instance, to move the tail from (2,5) to beyond, it needs many moves.\n\nSpecifically, the distance from tail to (2,2) is small, but the snake must move for the tail to advance.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be free when the segment that is there moves to another cell and no one comes.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should abandon (4,6) and focus on (2,2) first.\n\nAt turn 50, move down to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 51: move right to (5,1)  -- only choice\n\nThen turn 52: from (5,1), I can move up to (5,2) or right to (6,1)\n\nIf move up to (5,2), then similar to before.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move to (5,3) if it is tail, but after moving to (5,1) on turn 51, positions: let's not simulate.\n\nBut (2,2) is still not free.\n\nTo free (2,2) faster, I need to move the head in a way that the body at (2,2) is forced to move soon.\n\nBut it's not directly controllable.\n\nSince the snake is on a grid, and I move, the body will follow the path.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be vacated when the tail of the current snake moves off it, but the tail is at (6,3), and the snake has 16 segments, so it takes at least 16 moves for the tail to move to (2,2)? Not necessarily.\n\nThe time for a particular cell to be vacated depends on the movement.\n\nFor example, if I move the head away from (2,2), the segment at (2,2) will move to the next position after a few moves.\n\nIn the current configuration, the segment at (2,2) is index 2, so when the head moves once, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, which is (3,2) if head moves right, so (2,2) is vacated only if no other segment moves to it, but in this case, after head moves to (5,2), the new position at (2,2) is still occupied, by the segment that was index 3, which was (2,2) becomes the position for the next segment.\n\nAfter one move, the cell (2,2) is still occupied by the segment that was at (1,2) or something.\n\nLet's take a smaller example.\n\nSuppose snake: head at A, neck B, then C at (2,2), etc.\n\nAfter head moves to new, neck moves to A, C moves to B, so if B was not (2,2), then C moves to B, so (2,2) is now vacated if C was the only one there.\n\nIn this case, positions: head (4,2), neck (3,2), then (2,2), so (2,2) is index 2.\n\nAfter head moves to (5,2), new head (5,2), neck at (4,2) (old head), then the next segment at (3,2) (old neck), then at (2,2) (old index 2), so (2,2) is still occupied by the same segment? No.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (4,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (1,2), etc.\n\nAfter move right to (5,2), no eat, new positions: index 0: (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (1,2), etc.\n\nSo the cell (2,2) is now occupied by index 3, which was index 2 before, but it's the same cell occupied.\n\nThe segment that was at (2,2) is now at (3,2), and (2,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at (1,2), which moved to (2,2).\n\nSo (2,2) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n\nTo vacate (2,2), I need that no segment is assigned to it after the move.\n\nFor that, the segment that was at (2,2) must move away, and no segment from behind moves to it.\n\nBut since the snake is connected, when the head moves, the whole body shifts, so (2,2) will be occupied until the tail passes it.\n\nThe tail is at (6,3), which is far, so it will take many moves for the tail to reach the area.\n\nFor example, from (6,3) to (2,2), Manhattan distance 4+1=5, but since the snake moves one per turn, it takes at least 5 moves for the tail to move to adjacent, but to vacate (2,2), it will be when the segment that was at (2,2) has moved far, and the tail has passed.\n\nIn practice, with the snake length, it might take around 10 moves or more to free (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) life span 9, so at turn 50, after 9 turns, on turn 59 it might be gone, but life span 9 at turn 50, after turn 58 action, life=0, so must eat by turn 58.\n\nIf it takes many turns to free, I might not have time.\n\nIn the first plan, when I go to (4,6) by turn 55, (2,2) is still occupied, and I have only 3 turns to act, but I can't reach it.\n\nIf I move down at turn 50, I might be closer to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied, so I need to wait for it to free.\n\nPerhaps I should move in a way that I can eat (2,2) sooner.\n\nBut it's risky because of the tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo if the tail has food, and I eat it, when I grow, the new tail is at the same position, so head and tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (2,2), which is not tail, it's a body segment.\n\nSo when I eat it, it's not the tail, so no problem, I think.\n\nThe danger is only if I eat food that is on the tail cell when head is adjacent.\n\nBut here, (2,2) is not tail, so eating it should be fine, as long as I move to it when it's free.\n\nSo no tail reward danger for (2,2).\n\nNow, back to the decision.\n\nAt turn 50, I have two choices: R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nIf I go R to (5,2), I can eat (4,6) on turn 55, as planned.\n\nBut (2,2) will be lost because I can't eat it by turn 58.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), then I am closer to the bottom, and I might be able to free (2,2) sooner or eat other food.\n\nBut (4,6) might be too far to reach in time? Life span 6, until turn 55.\n\nFrom (4,1), to reach (4,6), Manhattan distance |dy|=5, so 5 moves.\n\nTurn 50: move D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (5,1)  -- only choice\n\nTurn 52: from (5,1), move R to (6,1) or U to (5,2)\n\nIf move U to (5,2), then turn 53 to (5,3), etc, similar to before, but to (4,6) it would take longer.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6), from turn 52 at (5,1), move U to (5,2) turn 53, then to (5,3) turn 54, to (5,4) turn 55, to (4,4) turn 56, to (4,5) turn 57, to (4,6) turn 58, but on turn 58, (4,6) life span: after turn 55 action, life=1 for (4,6)? Let's calculate.\n\n(4,6) life span 6 at turn 50.\n\nAfter turn 50 action (move to (4,1)), life=5\n\nAfter turn 51 action (move to (5,1)), life=4\n\nAfter turn 52 action (move to (5,2)), life=3\n\nAfter turn 53 action (move to (5,3)), life=2\n\nAfter turn 54 action (move to (5,4)), life=1\n\nAfter turn 55 action (move to (4,4)?), life=0, gone.\n\nOn turn 55, after action, life=0, so I cannot eat on turn 55 or later.\n\nTo eat on turn 54, I need to be at (4,6) on turn 54 action.\n\nBut from turn 52 at (5,1), I can go to (5,2) on turn 53, then to (5,3) on turn 54, not to (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,1) on turn 52, I can move right to (6,1), then up, but (4,6) is far.\n\nNo way to reach (4,6) by turn 54 from (4,1) start.\n\nSo if I move down at turn 50, I cannot eat (4,6) because I can't reach it in time.\n\nWhereas if I move right at turn 50, I can eat (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nFor (2,2), with life span 9, if I don't go for (4,6), I might eat (2,2) later, but I need to free it first.\n\nIf I move down at turn 50, I am closer, but still (2,2) occupied.\n\nFor example, turn 50 move D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 51 move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 52 move R to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 53 move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 54 move U to (6,3) but (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 52, after move to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n\nThen move R to (6,1): head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n\n(2,2) occupied.\n\nThen move U to (6,2): head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n\nStill.\n\nI think it will take at least 10 turns to free (2,2), but with life span 9, I might not make it.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (6,3), to move to (2,2), it needs to go left and down, but with the body, it will take many turns.\n\nSince the snake must move, the vacating of (2,2) depends on the movement of the head.\n\nBut roughly, the number of moves to free a cell is related to the position in the snake.\n\n(2,2) is index 2 from head, so when the head moves 2 steps, the segment at (2,2) moves to a new cell, but the cell (2,2) might be occupied by the next segment.\n\nAfter k moves, the cell (2,2) will be free when the tail segment has passed it.\n\nThe tail is at index 15, so it needs about 15 moves for the tail to reach the area, but not exactly.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the sure food at (4,6) and forget about (2,2).\n\n(2,2) might not be eatable in time.\n\nMoreover, there is the food at (5,5) which I can't eat, and (4,6) which I can.\n\nSo I think moving right at turn 50 is better.\n\nThen I can eat (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions for several turns.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"maximize score\", but since only one food can be eaten in this plan, and (2,2) might be lost, but I have no choice.\n\nPerhaps after eating (4,6), I can try to eat (2,2) if possible, but with life span, on turn 55, (2,2) life span: at turn 50 life=9, after 5 actions (turn 50 to 54), life=9-5=4, so on turn 55, before action, life=4, can eat until turn 58.\n\nFrom turn 55 head at (4,6), to (2,2), min 6 moves, so by turn 61, but life only until turn 58, so impossible.\n\nThus, (2,2) cannot be eaten regardless.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat (4,6) and ignore (2,2).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 50: R (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 51: U (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 52: U (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 53: L (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 54: U (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 55: U (to (4,6)) eat\n\nNow, for the answer format, I need to list actions starting from turn 50.\n\nAlso, think 5 turns ahead, so up to turn 54 or 55.\n\nSince turn 55 is the eat, I can include.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 53 L to (4,4), is (4,4) free? Yes, as per earlier.\n\nAnd no issues.\n\nTo be thorough, let's confirm the moves.\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2) move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2) move U to (5,3) — safe, tail\n\nTurn 52: from (5,3) move U to (5,4) — free\n\nTurn 53: from (5,4) move L to (4,4) — free\n\nTurn 54: from (4,4) move U to (4,5) — free\n\nTurn 55: from (4,5) move U to (4,6) — eat\n\nAll good.\n\nFor the boxed answer.\n\nThe current turn is 50, so actions from turn 50 onwards.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: L\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nI think that's the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (4,6) within its life span (available until turn 55) while avoiding the impossible-to-reach food at (5,5) (life span too short) and the difficult-to-reach food at (2,2) (occupied and insufficient time). The plan involves moving the snake towards (4,6) efficiently, considering the grid constraints and snake body positions.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food at (5,5)**: Life span of 3 at turn 50 means it disappears after turn 52. The Manhattan distance from (4,2) to (5,5) is 4, requiring at least 4 moves. The earliest arrival is turn 53 (after moves on turns 50, 51, 52), but the food is gone by then. Thus, eating (5,5) is impossible, and it is ignored.\n- **Food at (4,6)**: Life span of 6 at turn 50 means it can be eaten on turns 50–55. The Manhattan distance from (4,2) to (4,6) is 4, but due to body obstructions, a path via (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), and (4,4) is chosen to avoid collisions and ensure arrival by turn 55.\n- **Food at (2,2)**: Life span of 9 at turn 50 means it can be eaten on turns 50–58. However, it is under the snake's body (segment at turn 50), and freeing the cell requires many moves (estimated >10 turns due to snake length and position). After eating (4,6) on turn 55, the head is at (4,6), and reaching (2,2) (Manhattan distance 6) by turn 58 is impossible. Thus, eating (2,2) is not feasible.\n- **Movement Safety**: \n  - At turn 50, from head (4,2) moving right (current direction R), possible moves are R (to (5,2)), U (to (4,3), but occupied—deadly), or D (to (4,1)). Only R and D are safe, but D leads to a dead end and risks missing (4,6). R is chosen to start the path to (4,6).\n  - The path avoids walls (borders and (3,1)) and body collisions. Moving to the tail cell (e.g., (5,3) on turn 51) is safe since the tail moves away.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence ensures the snake survives and eats (4,6) on turn 55. After that, the snake can explore for new food, but no other food is reachable within their life spans.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 50–55):\n- **Turn 50**: Move R to (5,2) – Positions snake for upward movement, avoids immediate collision, and starts path to (4,6).\n- **Turn 51**: Move U to (5,3) – Safe, as (5,3) is the tail cell at this turn (tail moves away after move).\n- **Turn 52**: Move U to (5,4) – Free cell, continues path toward (4,6).\n- **Turn 53**: Move L to (4,4) – Free cell, aligns for direct upward move to (4,6).\n- **Turn 54**: Move U to (4,5) – Free cell, final approach to (4,6).\n- **Turn 55**: Move U to (4,6) – Eat food (life span 1 before decrease; value +1, snake grows).\n\nThis plan eats one food (+1 score) and ensures survival for future opportunities. Actions beyond turn 55 depend on new state but are not needed here as per the 5+ turn requirement.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 51: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 52: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 53: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 54: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 55: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 51. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,1) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,2), and the body segments follow: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nSnake head direction is R (right), meaning it's moving to the right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (5,5) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (4,6) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- At (2,2) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive). But (2,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions, (2,2) is the fourth segment (index 3 if head is 0). So, food is under the body at (2,2).\n\nFood can spawn under the body, but to eat it, the body must move away, and then the head must move onto it. Also, there's a tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the new tail grows into the head.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at borders, so cells outside x=0-7 or y=0-7 are invalid, but since borders are walls, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nList playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSo grid:\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)  but (3,1) is blocked, but y=3 is not blocked except for (3,1) which is at y=1.\n\n(3,1) is blocked, so for y=1, (3,1) is wall.\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  since (3,1) is wall.\n\nNow snake positions: head at (5,2), moving right, so from (5,2), next could be (6,2) or other directions, but current direction is R, so if it continues, it would go to (6,2).\n\nBut let's list all positions:\n\nIndex 0: (5,2) head\n\n1: (4,2)\n\n2: (3,2)\n\n3: (2,2)\n\n4: (1,2)\n\n5: (1,3)\n\n6: (1,4)\n\n7: (1,5)\n\n8: (1,6)\n\n9: (2,6)\n\n10: (2,5)\n\n11: (2,4)\n\n12: (2,3)\n\n13: (3,3)\n\n14: (4,3)\n\n15: (5,3) tail\n\nThe snake has a loop or something. From head (5,2) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) to (2,6) to (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) tail.\n\nSo the tail is at (5,3), which is above the head? Head at (5,2), tail at (5,3), so adjacent vertically.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (5,5): life span 2, so it disappears after turn 51 + 2 = turn 53? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 51, life span is 2, meaning after 2 more turns it will disappear? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (5,5), life span 2 at turn 51. After turn 51, life span becomes 1. After turn 52, life span 0, so it disappears at the end of turn 52 or beginning of turn 53? I think it disappears after the countdown reaches 0.\n\nTypically, if life span is L at turn t, it will be present until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n\nAt turn t, life span is L, it decreases every turn, so after turn t, at start of turn t+1, life span is L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears, so after turn when it was 1, at start of next turn it disappears.\n\nBut for movement, when snake moves, it can eat food on the cell it moves to at that turn.\n\nSo for food with life span L at turn t:\n\n- It can be eaten during turns from t to t+L-1.\n\n- At turn t+L, it is gone.\n\nHere turn t=51.\n\nFood at (5,5): life span 2, so can be eaten on turn 51 or 52. After turn 52, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life span 5, can be eaten from turn 51 to 55.\n\n(2,2): life span 8, can be eaten from turn 51 to 58.\n\nBut (2,2) is currently occupied by the snake body, segment index 3. So to eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away from (2,2), then head moves onto (2,2).\n\nCurrently, head is at (5,2), moving right.\n\nPossible moves from (5,2): since direction is R, it can go right to (6,2), up to (5,3), or down to (5,1), but not left because that would be opposite direction? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). So cannot move left immediately.\n\nAlso, cannot move into walls or body, except tail is okay if it moves.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves for turn 51.\n\nFrom head (5,2), direction R.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- R: right to (6,2). Is (6,2) valid? x=6, y=2, borders: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is within 1 to 6, y=2 within 1 to6, and no internal wall, so (6,2) is free? But is it occupied?\n\nSnake positions: (5,2) head, (4,2), (3,2), etc. down to (5,3) tail. (6,2) not in positions, so empty, I assume.\n\nFood not at (6,2), so moving to (6,2) is empty cell.\n\n- U: up to (5,3). (5,3) is the tail! Tail is at (5,3). Moving to tail is okay because the tail will move away when snake advances. So it's safe to move to the tail position, as long as no other body part is there.\n\nIn snake, when head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats and grows, so tail doesn't move; if not, tail moves forward.\n\nBut here, (5,3) is the tail. So if head moves to (5,3), since it's the tail, and if there's no food, it just moves, no problem. But if there were food, it might be dangerous, but there is no food at (5,3).\n\nFood is at (5,5), (4,6), (2,2). (5,3) has no food.\n\nSo moving to (5,3) is safe.\n\n- D: down to (5,1). (5,1) is within bounds? y=1, x=5, and (3,1) wall, but (5,1) is not wall, so it should be free. No snake body there, I think. Snake positions: all listed, no (5,1), so empty.\n\nBut y=1, and (3,1) is wall, but (5,1) is fine.\n\n- L: left to (4,2). But (4,2) is the first body segment. Moving to body segment is deadly, collision. So cannot move left to (4,2).\n\nAlso, cannot move left because it's opposite direction? Current direction R, moving L is reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: R to (6,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1). L not possible.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food to consider.\n\nFirst, food at (5,5) has short life, only until turn 52. So if we want to eat it, must be on turn 51 or 52.\n\nTurn 51: head at (5,2). To go to (5,5), it's not adjacent; (5,5) is at (x=5,y=5), head at (5,2), so same x, different y.\n\nDistance: |dy| = 3, so at least 3 moves needed, but with turns.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (5,5): need to move up three times.\n\nBut we have only two turns to eat it: turn 51 and 52.\n\nOn turn 51, from (5,2), if we move up to (5,3), that's closer.\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,3) to (5,4), but (5,4) is not food, then on turn 53 to (5,5), but food gone by turn 53? Turn 52 is the last chance to eat.\n\nLife span: at turn 51, life span=2, so it can be eaten on turn 51 or 52.\n\nAfter turn 52, it disappears.\n\nSo to eat on turn 52, head must be at (5,5) on turn 52.\n\nOn turn 51, head must move to a position from which it can reach (5,5) on turn 52.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves: to (6,2), (5,3), or (5,1).\n\nIf move to (5,3) on turn 51, then from (5,3) on turn 52, can move to (5,4), (6,3), or (4,3), but not down to (5,2) reverse.\n\n(5,4) is not (5,5), so cannot reach (5,5) from (5,3) in one move; need two moves: to (5,4) then (5,5), but that would be turn 53, too late.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,2) if move to (6,2) on turn 51, then on turn 52 from (6,2) can move to (6,3), (6,1), or (5,2) but reverse not allowed, or (7,2) but x=7 is wall, invalid. So only (6,3) or (6,1).\n\nNeither is (5,5).\n\nIf move down to (5,1) on turn 51, then from (5,1) can go to (5,2) but reverse? Direction would be from (5,1), after moving down, direction is D, so moving up to (5,2) is reverse? Current direction: after moving, the new direction is set.\n\nOn turn 51, after move, the head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nSo if from (5,2) move D to (5,1), then new head position (5,1), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,1) direction D, can move down? But y=1, down to (5,0) which is y=0, wall, invalid. Or left to (4,1), or right to (6,1), or up to (5,2) but up is opposite to current direction D? Current direction is D, so moving U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (5,1) direction D, possible moves: L to (4,1), R to (6,1), or D invalid.\n\nCannot go to (5,2) because reverse.\n\nSo no way to reach (5,5) from any of these in one move from turn 51 position.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (5,5) on turn 51 or 52, because head is at (5,2) and (5,5) is three steps away, but we have only two turns to be there, and we can't be at (5,5) on turn 51 or 52 starting from (5,2) with only one move possible per turn.\n\nOn turn 51, if we move directly, but (5,5) is not adjacent to (5,2); adjacent cells are (6,2), (5,3), (5,1), (4,2) but invalid.\n\nSo no, cannot reach (5,5) on turn 51.\n\nOn turn 52, head must be at (5,5). But on turn 51, head is at one of the adjacent cells to (5,5), which are (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5).\n\n(5,6) is y=6, within bounds, (4,5), (6,5) all possible.\n\nBut on turn 51, head is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to any of these; the closest is (5,3) or (6,2), but from (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) takes two moves.\n\nSo indeed, impossible to eat (5,5) food. It will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSo we can ignore this food; it's not reachable in time.\n\nNext, food at (4,6) with life span 5, so can be eaten from turn 51 to 55.\n\nAnd (2,2) with life span 8, but it's under the snake body now.\n\nFirst, let's plan the snake's movement.\n\nCurrent head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R to (6,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1).\n\nNow, let's consider each option.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (6,2) on turn 51.\n\nThen new head position (6,2), direction R.\n\nNow, from here, possible moves on next turns.\n\nBut we need to think multiple steps.\n\nAlso, tail is at (5,3), which will move when snake moves, unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten on this move.\n\nSo after move to (6,2), the new positions: head at (6,2), then body: previous head (5,2) becomes body, so snake: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] and tail was (5,3), but since no food, tail moves away, so the last segment (5,3) is removed, and new tail is (4,3)? Let's see the list.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0 to 15: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,2), the new head is (6,2), and the body starts from previous position 0, which is (5,2), so new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) and tail (5,3) is removed, so the segment (4,3) is now the tail? The body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed if no growth.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n\nSo new positions: [ (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] and (5,3) is gone, so tail is (4,3).\n\nLength is now 15? Original 16 segments, after move, head moved to new position, tail removed, so 15 segments. Positions from index 0 to 14.\n\nNew snake: head (6,2), then body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nFrom (6,2), direction R, possible moves on turn 52: R to (7,2) but x=7 wall, invalid; U to (6,3); D to (6,1); L to (5,2) but L is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed. So only U or D.\n\n(6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is empty? In new positions, (6,3) not occupied, yes.\n\n(6,1) empty.\n\nFood at (4,6) and (2,2), but (2,2) is still occupied by body.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (5,3) on turn 51.\n\n(5,3) is the current tail. Moving to tail is safe.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), since no food there (food not at (5,3)), so tail is removed? When head moves to (5,3), which was tail, but since no food eaten, the tail is removed, but head is moving to the tail position, so effectively, the snake doesn't grow, and the tail is gone, so the new snake has head at (5,3), and the body starts from previous head position? Let's see.\n\nOriginal positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), ..., up to tail (5,3).\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3): new head at (5,3), and since (5,3) was tail, and no food, so the tail is removed, but it's the same cell, so the new body should be the previous positions except the tail is not included, and head is new.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,3), then previous body: (5,2) becomes first body, then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) and tail was (5,3) but removed, so the last is (4,3), but (4,3) is now the tail? Let's list.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (1,2), 5: (1,3), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,6), 9: (2,6), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,4), 12: (2,3), 13: (3,3), 14: (4,3), 15: (5,3)\n\nAfter head moves to (5,3): new head (5,3), then the body is previous positions 0 to 14, but position 0 (5,2) is now first body segment, then 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), ..., up to 13: (3,3), 14: (4,3), and position 15 (5,3) is now head, so it's not body, but since we moved to it, and no growth, we remove the last segment, which was (5,3), but it's occupied by head, so we don't add a new segment, and we remove the tail, which was (5,3), but it's the same cell, so the snake shortens by one segment? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail cell is vacated, so the snake positions shift: the new head is at the new position, the previous head becomes first body, and so on, and the tail position is removed from the list.\n\nIn this case, head moves to (5,3), which was the tail position. So after move, new head at (5,3), and the body is from (5,2) to (4,3), but (5,2) is previous head, now first body, then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) and the tail (5,3) is gone, so (4,3) is now the new tail? But (4,3) was position 14, and position 15 is removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then segments: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3).\n\nSo the snake is now from (5,3) to (4,3), with (5,2) to (4,3) as body.\n\nLength 15 segments.\n\nDirection: after moving U, new direction U.\n\nOption 3: Move D to (5,1) on turn 51.\n\nNew head (5,1), direction D.\n\nThen body: (5,2), (4,2), etc. down to (4,3), tail (5,3) removed, so tail is (4,3).\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3).\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nFood at (5,5) is not reachable, so ignore.\n\nFood at (4,6) can be eaten until turn 55.\n\nFood at (2,2) can be eaten until turn 58, but it's under the body at (2,2), which is currently occupied.\n\nTo eat (2,2), the body must move away, then head moves in.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is occupied by the snake, segment index 3 in original.\n\nIn the current positions, it's the fourth segment.\n\nAfter any move, it might shift.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (5,3), which is not near.\n\nNow, let's think about the map. The snake has a lot of body on the left and top.\n\nPerhaps we can try to eat the food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n\nHead at (5,2), so we need to go up and left.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (4,6): delta x = -1, delta y = +4, so at least 5 moves, but with turns, we can do it in fewer if we move diagonally, but we can only move one cell at a time, so minimum 5 moves: e.g., U, U, U, L, U or something.\n\nBut we have time until turn 55.\n\nFirst, let's consider the move for turn 51.\n\nIf we move R to (6,2), then we are at the right edge.\n\nFrom there, we can go up to (6,3), then to (6,4), etc, to reach (4,6), but (4,6) is left and up from there.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (4,6): need to go left and up.\n\nBut at (6,2), we can only move U or D on turn 52, since no reverse.\n\nIf U to (6,3), then from (6,3) direction U, can move U to (6,4), L to (5,3), or R invalid, D reverse.\n\nSimilarly, if D to (6,1), then at bottom, might be dead end.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, x=6.\n\nFrom there, can move L or U, but not D or R.\n\nBut let's not go there; it might be risky.\n\nIf we move U to (5,3) on turn 51, then at (5,3), direction U.\n\nFrom (5,3), on turn 52, can move U to (5,4), L to (4,3), or R to (6,3), or D but reverse not allowed.\n\n(5,4) is empty, (4,3) is body? In the positions after move to (5,3), the body has (5,2), (4,2), etc, and (4,3) is tail, so (4,3) is tail, moving to tail is safe if no food, but no food at (4,3).\n\nFrom (5,3) move L to (4,3), which is tail, so safe.\n\nThen to (4,3), direction L.\n\nThen can move to (4,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,6), from (5,3), we can go up to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), then left to (4,6), but (5,5) has food but it will be gone soon, but we can't eat it, as we saw.\n\n(5,6) is at y=6, then to (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) but (5,5) food gone by turn 53, on turn 52 we might be at (5,4), turn 53 at (5,5) but food gone, or if we go directly.\n\nOn turn 51, if at (5,3), turn 52 move U to (5,4), turn 53 move U to (5,5) but food at (5,5) gone on turn 53, so on turn 53, if we move to (5,5), it might be gone, so no food.\n\nThen turn 54 to (5,6), turn 55 to (4,6) or (6,6), etc.\n\nBut to eat (4,6) on turn 55, we need to be at (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 51, after moving U to (5,4) on turn 52, U to (5,5) on turn 53 (but no food), U to (5,6) on turn 54, then on turn 55, from (5,6) can move L to (4,6) to eat, or D to (5,5), or R to (6,6), etc.\n\nSo if we move L to (4,6) on turn 55, we can eat it, since life span 5, turn 51 to 55, so on turn 55 it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is currently occupied by the snake. In the current state, it's the position of segment, which is body.\n\nTo eat it, we need the snake to move so that this cell is vacated, then head moves in.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (2,2) is part of the body.\n\nWhen the snake moves, this segment will move only if the parts before it move.\n\nThe snake is moving, so each turn, the body segments shift.\n\nFor example, on turn 51, if we move the head, the body will shift, so the segment at (2,2) might move to a new position.\n\nIn original positions, index 3: (2,2)\n\nAfter head moves, depending on direction.\n\nIf head moves to (6,2), then the new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) becomes (2,2) still? No, the body segments shift towards the head.\n\nWhen head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it.\n\nSo for index 1, it moves to where index 0 was, index 2 to where index 1 was, etc.\n\nIn this case, after head moves to (6,2), the new body segment 1 is at (5,2), which was previous head.\n\nSegment 2 is at (4,2), previous segment 1 position.\n\nSegment 3 is at (3,2), previous segment 2 position.\n\nSegment 4 is at (2,2), previous segment 3 position.\n\nPrevious segment 3 was (2,2), so segment 4 moves to (2,2)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: 0: (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (1,2), etc.\n\nAfter head moves to (6,2), new positions:\n\nHead: (6,2)\n\nBody 1: previous pos 0: (5,2)\n\nBody 2: previous pos 1: (4,2)\n\nBody 3: previous pos 2: (3,2)\n\nBody 4: previous pos 3: (2,2)  so (2,2) is still occupied by body 4.\n\nSimilarly, body 5: previous pos 4: (1,2)\n\nAnd so on, up to body 15: previous pos 14: (4,3)  and tail removed.\n\nSo (2,2) is still occupied by the body.\n\nSimilarly, if we move head to (5,3), new positions: head (5,3), body 1: (5,2), body 2: (4,2), body 3: (3,2), body 4: (2,2), so (2,2) still occupied.\n\nIf move to (5,1), similarly, (2,2) still occupied.\n\nSo after one move, (2,2) is still occupied by a body segment.\n\nTo vacate (2,2), we need the snake to move such that the segment that was at (2,2) moves away, and no other segment moves there immediately.\n\nBut since the body moves in a chain, when the head moves, the tail end moves away.\n\nFor example, the segment at (2,2) will move when the segment before it moves.\n\nCurrently, the segment before (2,2) is (3,2), which is at index 2.\n\nIf the head moves, and the body shifts, the segment that was at (3,2) will move to where (2,2) was? No.\n\nIn the shift, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for the cell (2,2), it is occupied by segment 3.\n\nAfter a move, segment 3 moves to the position that segment 2 was at before the move.\n\nBefore move, segment 2 is at (3,2).\n\nSo after move, segment 3 moves to (3,2).\n\nThen the cell (2,2) is vacated only if no new segment moves there.\n\nBut after the shift, the new occupant of (2,2) would be segment 4, which was at (1,2) before, moves to (2,2)? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: positions: seg0: (5,2), seg1: (4,2), seg2: (3,2), seg3: (2,2), seg4: (1,2), etc.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, say (6,2):\n\nNew seg0 (head): (6,2)\n\nNew seg1: old seg0 position (5,2)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 position (4,2)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 position (3,2)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 position (2,2)  so (2,2) is now occupied by new seg4, which was old seg3.\n\nOld seg3 was at (2,2), new seg4 is at old seg3 position (2,2), so it stays.\n\nThe cell (2,2) is still occupied.\n\nTo vacate (2,2), we need the snake to move in such a way that the segment that is at (2,2) moves, and the next segment does not move to (2,2), which only happens if the snake is growing or something, but normally, when no growth, the tail moves away, but the body segments shift, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but other cells may be occupied.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (5,3), not (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is in the middle.\n\nSo to vacate (2,2), we need the snake to move so that the segment at (2,2) moves to a different position, and since the segments shift, the cell (2,2) will be occupied by the next segment, unless that segment is the tail and it is removed.\n\nBut the segment after (2,2) is (1,2), which is not tail.\n\nTail is at (5,3).\n\nOnly when the tail moves, the cell is vacated, but for middle cells, they are always occupied unless the snake shortens, but it doesn't.\n\nThe only way to vacate a body-occupied cell is for that part of the body to move away, but since the body is connected, it's difficult; usually, only the tail cell is vacated when the snake moves without eating.\n\nFor a cell under the body to be vacated, it requires that the segment occupying it moves away and no other segment moves in, which can happen if that segment is the tail and it moves, or if the snake turns and the body leaves the cell empty.\n\nFor example, if the snake makes a turn, the body might leave some cells empty.\n\nIn this case, at (2,2), it is occupied, and the snake is mostly horizontal at that point.\n\nTo eat the food at (2,2), we need to have the head move to (2,2) after it is vacated.\n\nFirst, we need to vacate (2,2).\n\nCurrently, the snake has a segment at (2,2), and it is connected to (3,2) before and (1,2) after.\n\nIf the snake moves in a way that the segment at (2,2) moves to (3,2) or something, but let's see the path.\n\nPerhaps we can have the snake change direction so that the body moves away from (2,2).\n\nFor example, if the head moves, and the body shifts, the segment that was at (3,2) might move to (4,2) or something, but let's simulate.\n\nSuppose on turn 51, we move the head to (5,3) U.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,3), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), etc.\n\n(2,2) is still occupied by body segment (now index 4 or something).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,3) we can move L to (4,3), which is the tail, so safe.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), new head (4,3), body: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), etc.\n\n(2,2) still occupied.\n\nOr if we move U from (5,3) to (5,4), then head (5,4), body: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc. still (2,2) occupied.\n\nTo vacate (2,2), we need the segment that is there to move away, and since it's not the tail, the only way is for the snake to grow or for the body to stretch, but in this case, we need to move the head in a way that the body at (2,2) is no longer there after some moves.\n\nPerhaps after several moves, when the tail moves, but the tail is far away.\n\nThe tail is at (5,3), and the body at (2,2) is fixed until the head moves enough to pull it.\n\nSince the snake is long, it will take many moves for the body at (2,2) to move.\n\nFor example, each time the head moves, the body segments shift, so the segment at (2,2) will move to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nCurrently, the segment before (2,2) is at (3,2), so when that moves, (2,2) will move to (3,2).\n\nBut to have (2,2) vacated, we need that no segment moves to it, which means that the segment that was behind it does not move to (2,2), but since the segments shift, the segment behind will move to (2,2) if it was at (1,2) or something.\n\nIn general, for a cell occupied by a body segment, it will be vacated only if that segment is the tail and it moves, or if the snake eats food and grows, but that's not helpful.\n\nOtherwise, the cell remains occupied until the segment moves away and the gap is not filled, but in a snake, the body is contiguous, so cells are only vacated at the tail when it moves.\n\nFor internal body cells, they are always occupied unless the snake shortens, which it doesn't without eating negative food, but here all food is positive.\n\nSo, in this case, since (2,2) is occupied by a body segment, and it's not the tail, it will remain occupied as long as the snake is there, and the only way to vacate it is for the tail to pass through it or something, but the tail is at (5,3), far away.\n\nThe distance from tail to (2,2) is many segments, so it will take at least the number of segments between for (2,2) to be vacated.\n\nFor example, the segment at (2,2) is index 3, tail is index 15, so 12 segments away, so after 12 moves, the tail will be at (2,2) if the snake doesn't turn, but it will turn.\n\nBut when the tail moves to (2,2), it will be vacated when the tail moves away.\n\nSo eventually, (2,2) can be vacated, but it might take many turns.\n\nLife span is 8, so from turn 51 to 58, we have time.\n\nBut let's estimate how many turns to vacate (2,2).\n\nThe segment at (2,2) will move when the head moves, but it moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nTo have the cell (2,2) empty, we need the segment that is there to move and no new segment to move in, which only happens when that segment is the tail.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (2,2) is not the tail; the tail is at (5,3).\n\nThe number of segments between head and this segment is 3 (since head index 0, this index 3), so after 3 moves, this segment will be at the position where the head was at some point, but the cell (2,2) will be occupied by the next segment.\n\nAfter k moves, the segment that was at position i will be at position i-k if k<=i, or removed if k>i, but since it's body, it shifts.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be occupied until the tail moves past it.\n\nThe tail is at index 15, position (5,3).\n\nThe position (2,2) is occupied by segment 3.\n\nThe distance from segment 3 to tail is 12 segments.\n\nSo after approximately 12 moves, the tail will be near (2,2), and when it moves away, (2,2) will be vacated.\n\nBut it might be less if the snake turns.\n\nFor example, if the head moves up, the body might not all move straight.\n\nBut roughly, it will take at least 12 turns for the tail to reach the area, so (2,2) might be vacated around turn 51 + 12 = turn 63, but life span only to turn 58, so it might not be vacated in time to eat the food.\n\nLife span 8 at turn 51, so disappears after turn 58, so last eat on turn 58.\n\nTurn 51 + 12 = 63 > 58, so it might not be possible to eat (2,2) food because the body may not move away in time.\n\nLet's see the snake path: from (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) etc, so at (2,2), it is part of the horizontal section from (1,2) to (2,2) to (3,2), etc.\n\nIf the head moves right or up, the body will eventually pull, but the segment at (2,2) will move to (3,2) when the head moves, then to (4,2), etc, but the cell (2,2) will be occupied by the segment that was at (1,2), which is now moving to (2,2), so it stays occupied.\n\nOnly when the tail moves from (1,6) or something, it might vacate, but the tail is at (5,3), and the body goes from (1,2) to (1,6) to (2,6) etc, so the cell (2,2) is on a different part.\n\nTo vacate (2,2), we need the tail to be the segment that is at (2,2), but currently it's not, and it will take many moves for the tail to reach that position.\n\nSince the snake is long, and the tail is far, it might not happen within 8 turns.\n\nFor example, the shortest path from tail to (2,2) is not direct, but the number of moves for the tail to move to (2,2) is at least the Manhattan distance or more, but in terms of segments, there are 12 segments between, so after 12 moves, the tail could be at (2,2) if the snake moves straight, but it's not.\n\nBut in any case, it's likely that (2,2) remains occupied for many turns, and with life span 8, it may not be vacated by turn 58.\n\nTherefore, it might not be feasible to eat the (2,2) food.\n\nSo perhaps we should focus on the food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free, and can be eaten until turn 55.\n\nHead at (5,2), so we need to go to (4,6).\n\nPossible paths.\n\nFirst, for turn 51, we need to choose a move.\n\nOptions: R to (6,2), U to (5,3), or D to (5,1).\n\nD to (5,1) might be risky because it's near the bottom, and we might get trapped.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), we can only move to (4,1), (6,1), or up to (5,2) but reverse not allowed if we moved down.\n\nAfter moving D to (5,1), direction D, then can only move L or R, not U or D.\n\nThen from (5,1), if move L to (4,1), then to (3,1) but (3,1) is wall, so from (4,1) can move to (4,2), (4,0) invalid, (3,1) wall, (5,1) but reverse, so only (4,2) if possible.\n\nBut (4,2) might be occupied.\n\nIn current state, (4,2) is body, but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut it could be messy, so better to avoid going down.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (6,2) puts us on the edge.\n\nMoving U to (5,3) is towards the center and up, which is better for reaching (4,6).\n\nSo I think moving U to (5,3) on turn 51 is a good choice.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to (5,4), etc.\n\nAlso, after moving U, new direction U.\n\nOn turn 52, from (5,3) direction U, can move U to (5,4), L to (4,3), or R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is the tail, so moving to (4,3) is safe.\n\n(5,4) is empty.\n\n(6,3) empty.\n\nTo reach (4,6), we can go directly up then left.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,4) on turn 52.\n\nThen from (5,4) direction U, can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4), D reverse not allowed.\n\n(5,5) has food but it will be gone on turn 53, so on turn 53, if we move to (5,5), it might be gone, no food.\n\nSo better not to go there.\n\nMove to (4,4) or (6,4).\n\nSay move L to (4,4) on turn 52 from (5,4)? On turn 52 from (5,3) move to (5,4), then on turn 53 from (5,4) move to (4,4) or something.\n\nLet's make a plan to reach (4,6) by turn 55.\n\nTurn 51: move U to (5,3)  // now at (5,3), dir U\n\nTurn 52: move U to (5,4)  // at (5,4), dir U\n\nTurn 53: from (5,4) dir U, move L to (4,4)  // now at (4,4), dir L\n\nThen turn 54: from (4,4) dir L, can move L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3), or R reverse not allowed.\n\n(4,5) is up, towards (4,6).\n\nMove U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55: from (4,5) dir U (since moved U), can move U to (4,6), which is the food, so eat it.\n\nYes, and on turn 55, life span allows.\n\nNow, is this path safe? Need to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, on turn 51: move U from (5,2) to (5,3). (5,3) was tail, so safe, no issue.\n\nAfter move, snake positions: head (5,3), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nTurn 52: move U to (5,4). (5,4) is empty, no food, so move there.\n\nNew head (5,4), direction U.\n\nBody: previous head (5,3) becomes body, so new positions: head (5,4), body1: (5,3), body2: (5,2), body3: (4,2), body4: (3,2), ..., down to body15: (3,3) and tail (4,3) removed, so tail is (3,3)? Let's list.\n\nPrevious positions after turn 51: head (5,3), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nAfter moving to (5,4): new head (5,4), body1: (5,3), body2: (5,2), body3: (4,2), body4: (3,2), body5: (2,2), body6: (1,2), body7: (1,3), body8: (1,4), body9: (1,5), body10: (1,6), body11: (2,6), body12: (2,5), body13: (2,4), body14: (2,3), body15: (3,3) and tail (4,3) removed, so the last body is (3,3), tail (3,3)? Body15 is (3,3), which is now tail.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then body: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nLength 15 segments.\n\nTurn 53: move L to (4,4). From (5,4) direction U, moving L is left, which is not reverse, so allowed.\n\n(4,4) is empty? No snake body there, yes.\n\nNew head (4,4), direction L.\n\nBody: previous head (5,4) becomes body1, so positions: head (4,4), body1: (5,4), body2: (5,3), body3: (5,2), body4: (4,2), body5: (3,2), body6: (2,2), body7: (1,2), body8: (1,3), body9: (1,4), body10: (1,5), body11: (1,6), body12: (2,6), body13: (2,5), body14: (2,4), tail (3,3) but (3,3) was tail, removed? After move, tail is removed.\n\nPrevious tail (3,3) removed, new tail is (2,4)? Body14: (2,4), since body13 is (2,5), body14: (2,4), and body15 was (3,3) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body1: (5,4), body2: (5,3), body3: (5,2), body4: (4,2), body5: (3,2), body6: (2,2), body7: (1,2), body8: (1,3), body9: (1,4), body10: (1,5), body11: (1,6), body12: (2,6), body13: (2,5), body14: (2,4) tail? Body14 is (2,4), and (2,3) was body14 before? After turn 52, positions had body14: (2,3)? Let's keep track.\n\nAfter turn 52: positions: head (5,4), body1: (5,3), body2: (5,2), body3: (4,2), body4: (3,2), body5: (2,2), body6: (1,2), body7: (1,3), body8: (1,4), body9: (1,5), body10: (1,6), body11: (2,6), body12: (2,5), body13: (2,4), body14: (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\nI think I missed; after turn 52, body14 is (2,3), tail (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 53, move to (4,4): new head (4,4), body1: (5,4), body2: (5,3), body3: (5,2), body4: (4,2), body5: (3,2), body6: (2,2), body7: (1,2), body8: (1,3), body9: (1,4), body10: (1,5), body11: (1,6), body12: (2,6), body13: (2,5), body14: (2,4) and tail (3,3) removed, so new tail is (2,4)? Body14 is (2,4), but body13 is (2,5), body14: (2,4), so tail is (2,4).\n\nPositions: head (4,4), body1: (5,4), body2: (5,3), body3: (5,2), body4: (4,2), body5: (3,2), body6: (2,2), body7: (1,2), body8: (1,3), body9: (1,4), body10: (1,5), body11: (1,6), body12: (2,6), body13: (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is tail.\n\nNow turn 54: from (4,4) direction L, can move L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3), or R to (5,4) but reverse not allowed.\n\n(4,5) is empty, move U to (4,5).\n\nNew head (4,5), direction U.\n\nBody: body1: (4,4), body2: (5,4), etc., tail moves away.\n\nTurn 55: from (4,5) direction U, move U to (4,6), which has food, so eat it, snake grows, tail doesn't move.\n\nNow, all moves seem safe, no collision.\n\nIf on turn 53 we moved differently, but this works.\n\nWe could go faster, but this reaches on turn 55 to eat.\n\nNow, for turn 51, we move U to (5,3).\n\nBut is there a better first move?\n\nIf we move R to (6,2) on turn 51, then we can go up to (6,3), then (6,4), then (5,4), then (4,4), then (4,5), then (4,6) on turn 56, but turn 56 is after turn 55, and food disappears after turn 55, so on turn 56 it's gone, cannot eat. Turn 55 is the last chance.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (4,6) in fewer moves? Minimum Manhattan distance |dx|=2, |dy|=4, so 6 moves, from turn 51 to 56, but turn 56 too late.\n\nTurn 51: at (6,2)\n\nTurn 52: to (6,3) or (6,4) if possible, but only one move per turn.\n\nTurn 52: from (6,2) move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 53: to (6,4)\n\nTurn 54: to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf to (6,5), turn 55 to (6,6) or L to (5,5) but (5,5) gone, or to (5,6) not (4,6).\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 53, move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 54: from (5,4) move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 55: to (4,5) or (4,3), not (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 55, can move U to (4,5), not to (4,6) directly.\n\nThen on turn 56 to (4,6), too late.\n\nSo cannot reach from right side in time.\n\nIf move D to (5,1), worse.\n\nSo moving U on turn 51 is best.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe question says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1.\n\nIn the state, current turn is 51, so I need to list actions for turn 51, 52, 53, etc.\n\nBut how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd since we planned to turn 55, I can list up to there.\n\nBut for the move, on each turn, we decide based on state, but since we have a plan, we can list.\n\nIn the plan above, we have:\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: L (from (5,4) to (4,4))\n\nIn turn 53, from (5,4) we moved L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 54: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: U to (4,6)\n\nBut after turn 55, we eat, but we need to continue? The question is to provide actions for the sequence, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"maximize score\" and \"long-term\", but for now, we can provide until we eat the food.\n\nBut after eating, we need to survive, but we can think later.\n\nSince we are to think 5+ turns ahead, and we have 5 turns from 51 to 55, we can list 5 actions.\n\nt1=51, so turns 51 to 55 or 56.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nIn the plan, turn 51: U\n\nBut at turn 51, moving U to (5,3) is fine.\n\nThen turn 52: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 53: from (5,4), we moved L to (4,4), but we could move U to (5,5) but no food, or R to (6,4), but we chose L to go towards (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, turn 54: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: U to (4,6)\n\nNow, is there any risk? For example, when moving to (4,4) on turn 53, is it safe? At that point, snake body includes (5,4), (5,3), etc., but (4,4) was empty, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: when we move to (4,6) on turn 55, head to (4,6), which is food, so we eat, and snake grows, so the tail doesn't move. But is head adjacent to tail before move? Before moving, on turn 54, head at (4,5), tail at, let's see.\n\nAfter turn 54 move to (4,5), we need to see positions.\n\nBut in general, as long as head is not adjacent to the tail cell with food, it should be fine. Here, the food is at (4,6), not on tail, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, in previous moves.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nTherefore, for turn 51: U\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as per plan.\n\nBut since the answer should list actions, and we think ahead.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions for turn 51 to 55.\n\nBut turn 55 is the eat move.\n\nNow, for the format.\n\nAlso, on turn 53, we move L, but from (5,4), moving L is to (4,4), which is west, so left.\n\nIn terms of direction.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (4,6) while avoiding collisions and considering the food life spans. The food at (5,5) cannot be reached before it disappears on turn 53, and the food at (2,2) is currently under the snake's body and is unlikely to be vacated within its life span due to the snake's length and position. Therefore, the plan focuses on reaching (4,6) by turn 55 to eat it safely.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 51)**:\n  - Head at (5,2), direction right.\n  - Possible moves: Right to (6,2), Up to (5,3), or Down to (5,1). Left is invalid (reverse direction and body collision).\n- **Food Analysis**:\n  - (5,5): Life span 2 (disappears after turn 52), unreachable from (5,2) in 2 turns. Ignored.\n  - (4,6): Life span 5 (eatable until turn 55). Target for eating on turn 55.\n  - (2,2): Life span 8 (eatable until turn 58), but under body and unlikely to be vacated in time. Not targeted.\n- **Path to (4,6)**:\n  - From (5,2), moving Up to (5,3) on turn 51 starts an efficient path upward.\n  - Continue Up to (5,4) on turn 52.\n  - Move Left to (4,4) on turn 53 to approach the target.\n  - Move Up to (4,5) on turn 54.\n  - Move Up to (4,6) on turn 55 to eat the food.\n- **Collision and Risk Avoidance**:\n  - All moves avoid walls, body segments (except safe tail moves), and reverse directions.\n  - Moving to (5,3) on turn 51 is safe as it is the current tail position and no food is present.\n  - The path to (4,6) stays within bounds and avoids known obstacles (e.g., internal wall at (3,1) is irrelevant here).\n  - No tail reward danger: (4,6) is not the tail cell, and head is not adjacent to tail when eating.\n- **Long-Term Survival**:\n  - After eating on turn 55, the snake grows, increasing length to 17. Future moves (beyond turn 55) should focus on open spaces (e.g., moving left or right from (4,6) to avoid trapping), but the sequence up to turn 55 ensures survival and score gain.\n\n### Planned Moves (5 Turns Ahead):\nThe sequence below eats the food at (4,6) on turn 55 and is collision-free based on the current state and projected positions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: L \\\\\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 52, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at the borders, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nThe border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning that any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6, and x from 1 to 6. But let's see the snake positions: for example, (1,2), (1,3), etc., which have x=1, so x=1 is playable, similarly y=1 to y=6 should be playable. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6; y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. Yes, playable grid is 6x6: (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). That's 16 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving in the positive y-direction.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,5) with life span 1, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive) – but (2,2) is occupied by the snake's body! It's the fifth segment in the list: positions are [(5,3) head, (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), ...]. So (2,2) is part of the body, but food is there? That must be food spawned under the body.\n\nFood can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, (6,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll foods are positive, value 1, so no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (5,5) it's 1, meaning it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 52, life span 1 means after this turn, it might disappear? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor food at (5,5) with life span 1 on turn 52. On turn 52, if the snake eats it, it gets eaten before disappearing? Or does it disappear at the end of turn 52?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and N is life span. With countdown decreasing each turn, including current.\n\nI think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn, if life span is K, it will disappear after K more turns. So for life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, meaning at the end of turn 52, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nBut during turn 52, if the head moves to that cell, it can be eaten before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for (2,2), it has life span 7, so it will last several turns, but it's under the body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away first.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, what is the tail? Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n\nIndex 0: head (5,3)\n\n1: (5,2)\n\n2: (4,2)\n\n3: (3,2)\n\n4: (2,2)  // this is where food is, but it's a body segment\n\n5: (1,2)\n\n6: (1,3)\n\n7: (1,4)\n\n8: (1,5)\n\n9: (1,6)\n\n10: (2,6)\n\n11: (2,5)\n\n12: (2,4)\n\n13: (2,3)\n\n14: (3,3)\n\n15: (4,3)  // tail\n\nSo tail is at (4,3)\n\nHead is at (5,3), moving up, direction U.\n\nFrom head (5,3), moving U would go to (5,4).\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite to U, and no instant reverse.\n\nDirections: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n\nCurrent direction U, so I cannot move D on next turn. Allowed moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, grid boundaries: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNow, let's find where the head can move:\n\nCurrent position (5,3)\n\nMove U: (5,4) – is this valid? y=4, between 1 and 6, x=5, between 1 and 6. Check if wall or obstacle: not wall, obstacle at (3,1) not relevant. So (5,4) is empty? Need to check if occupied by body.\n\nSnake positions: (5,4) is not in the list, so it should be free, unless food or something, but food doesn't block, only if head moves to food, it eats.\n\nCells can have food, but snake can move there to eat, or if empty, just move.\n\nBut body segments occupy cells, so cannot move to body segment except tail under certain conditions.\n\nRule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move to the cell occupied by the tail segment, because tail will move forward.\n\nSo, for a move to be safe, the target cell must not be a wall, not an obstacle, not a body segment except if it is the tail.\n\nIn this case, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,4)\n\nWhat is at (5,4)? Not in snake positions, so empty or food? Food is at (5,5), (4,6), (2,2), (6,5). (5,4) not listed, so empty. So U to (5,4) is safe.\n\n- L: to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is in snake positions: it's the tail, index 15: (4,3)\n\nSince it's the tail, and if I move to (4,3), after moving, the tail will move away, so it should be safe, as long as no other collision.\n\nRule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nSo moving to tail position is allowed and safe, because after move, tail moves, so head doesn't collide with body.\n\n- R: to (6,3)\n\n(6,3) – x=6, y=3. Walls: x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is playable, y=3 playable. Not obstacle, not in snake positions, so empty. Safe.\n\n- D: not allowed, since opposite direction.\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival and maximize score.\n\nFirst, let's list the food:\n\n- (5,5): life span 1, value 1. At turn 52, life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. So only available on turn 52.\n\n- (4,6): life span 4, value 1. So available for 4 more turns, including turn 52? Life span decreases each turn including current, so on turn 52, life span 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including this one? Or after this turn, 3 left?\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's ambiguous. Let me assume that at the start of turn, if life span is K, it will be present for this turn and disappear after K turns, meaning it has K turns left including current.\n\nFor example, life span 1: available only this turn, disappears after.\n\nLife span 2: available this turn and next, disappears after next turn.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nSo for (5,5): life span 1, so must be eaten on turn 52 or it's gone.\n\n(4,6): life span 4, so available turns 52,53,54,55, disappears after turn 55.\n\n(2,2): life span 7, available turns 52 to 58.\n\n(6,5): life span 10, available turns 52 to 61.\n\nNow, (2,2) is currently under the body at position (2,2), which is index 4 in snake positions. To eat it, the body must move away, then head moves to it.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (2,2) will move when the snake moves.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,3), and head is at (5,3), adjacent? Head (5,3) and tail (4,3) are adjacent horizontally, since |5-4|=1, |3-3|=0, so yes, adjacent.\n\nIf the tail has food, and head eats it, it could be dangerous due to Tail Reward Danger.\n\nBut tail is at (4,3), and is there food there? Food is at (2,2), (5,5), etc., not at (4,3), so no food on tail. So no issue.\n\nFood at (2,2) is under a body segment, not tail.\n\nNow, for turn 52, I need to choose action.\n\nOption 1: Move towards (5,5) to eat it this turn.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), head at (5,3), moving U would go to (5,4), not (5,5). To reach (5,5) from (5,3), I need to move up twice: first to (5,4), then to (5,5). But (5,5) has life span 1, so only on turn 52. If I move to (5,4) on turn 52, I can't eat (5,5) on turn 52 because I'm not on it. On turn 52, if I move to (5,4), I'm not eating any food, then (5,5) disappears. So I miss it.\n\nTo eat (5,5) on turn 52, I must move directly to (5,5) from current position.\n\nCurrent position (5,3), (5,5) is two steps up. But I can only move one cell per turn. So from (5,3) to (5,5) requires two moves: first to (5,4), then to (5,5). But on turn 52, I can only move to (5,4), not to (5,5). Then on turn 53, (5,5) is gone if life span 1.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (5,5) because it disappears after this turn, and I can't reach it in one move from (5,3). Distance is |5-5| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2, so two moves away. Since only one move per turn, I can't reach it this turn. So (5,5) cannot be eaten; it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, for other foods.\n\nSo for (5,5), it's out of reach, so ignore it.\n\nNow, other foods: (4,6), (2,2), (6,5)\n\n(2,2) is under body, so I need to free that cell first.\n\nCurrent snake position has segment at (2,2), which is the fourth body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nLet me simulate the snake movement.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's find a safe path to eat food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 16 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nPlayable grid: 6x6, from (1,1) to (6,6), minus obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6 except (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSo total cells: 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 16 cells, so 19 free cells, including food positions.\n\nFood at (4,6), (2,2), (6,5), and (5,5) which is about to disappear.\n\n(5,5) will disappear, so after turn 52, only three foods.\n\nNow, (2,2) is occupied by body, so not free yet.\n\nFree cells: all cells not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nList all playable cells: for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (3,1)\n\nSnake positions: from (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nSo occupied: (5,3),(5,2),(4,2),(3,2),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)\n\nNow, food at (4,6), (6,5), and (2,2) but (2,2) is occupied, so only (4,6) and (6,5) are on free cells.\n\n(2,2) has food but under snake, so not accessible yet.\n\nFree cells: total playable cells minus snake minus obstacle.\n\nPlayable cells: 6x6=36 minus (3,1) = 35 cells.\n\nSnake: 16 cells.\n\nBut (3,1) is obstacle, not occupied by snake, so free cells: 35 - 16 = 19 cells, including the food positions except (2,2) which is occupied.\n\n(4,6) and (6,5) are free, (2,2) is occupied.\n\nAlso, (5,5) is free but will disappear.\n\nSo after turn 52, if no eat, snake still 16, (5,5) disappears, so free cells: 19 minus (5,5) = 18, plus (2,2) has food but occupied, so when snake moves, if tail moves, (4,3) is freed, but (2,2) might be freed later.\n\nI need to plan moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 52, I have to choose one of U, L, R.\n\nU to (5,4)\n\nL to (4,3) which is tail\n\nR to (6,3)\n\nNow, let's see the consequences.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), new head position (5,4), body follows, tail at (4,3) moves to where? When head moves to (5,4), the segment that was at (5,3) becomes body at (5,3), and tail (4,3) might move depending on the move.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, so the cell that was tail is freed, unless food is eaten.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten if move to (5,4), since no food there.\n\nSo after move U:\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), then body: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) and tail was (4,3), but since no eat, tail is removed, so new tail is (3,3)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: [ (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\nHead moves to (5,4), so new head (5,4)\n\nThen the body segments shift: the first body segment is the old head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), etc., up to (3,3), and the last segment (4,3) is removed since no grow.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nTail is now (3,3)\n\nHead at (5,4), direction was U, but after move, new direction depends on action.\n\nFor next move, I can choose based on new position.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (4,3): (4,3) is the tail, so moving to tail position.\n\nSince no food there, head moves to (4,3), which was tail, so after move, the tail is removed, but since head takes that cell, it's ok, and new tail is the previous second last.\n\nPrevious positions: [ (5,3), (5,2), ..., (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove head to (4,3), so new head (4,3)\n\nThen body: old head (5,3) becomes first body, then (5,2), (4,2), ..., (3,3), and the last segment (4,3) is gone, but it's the target, so new positions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nTail is (3,3)\n\nIf move R to (6,3): new head (6,3), body [ (5,3), (5,2), ..., (4,3) ], tail removed, so new positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ] and tail (3,3)\n\nIn all cases, after move, tail is at (3,3) or similar, but in U move, tail is (3,3), in L move, tail is (3,3), in R move, tail is (3,3). In all cases, the new tail is (3,3) because the last segment removed was (4,3), and (3,3) becomes tail.\n\nIn U move: new positions have (3,3) as last.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, back to food.\n\n(5,5) is not reachable, so ignore.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is above. Life span 4, so available for 4 turns.\n\n(6,5) at (6,5), right and up.\n\n(2,2) at (2,2), which is currently occupied, but in the body. In the current position, (2,2) is occupied, but when the snake moves, if no eat, the tail moves, freeing (4,3), but (2,2) is still occupied until that segment moves.\n\nTo free (2,2), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (2,2) is no longer there, which happens when it becomes the tail and is removed, or when the body moves away.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is the fourth segment from head. When the head moves, this segment will shift, but it stays at (2,2) for now? No.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,4), new positions: as above, (2,2) is still there, at index 5 in the new list: [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), ... ] so (2,2) is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L or R, (2,2) remains occupied for now.\n\nIt will take several moves for (2,2) to be freed, depending on how the snake moves.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) will move only when the head moves and the body shifts.\n\nFor instance, each time the head moves without eating, the tail is removed, but the body segments move to the next position.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves to a new position.\n\nSince the snake is moving, eventually that segment will be the tail and be removed, freeing the cell.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nCurrent snake length 16, the segment at (2,2) is the 5th segment (index 4, 0-based).\n\nWhen the head moves, this segment doesn't move immediately; it stays until the movement propagates.\n\nThe distance from head to that segment is 4 steps (since indices 0 to 4, difference 4).\n\nWhen the head moves, the segment at position i moves to the previous position of i-1, but for the cell, it changes when the segment leaves it.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think that the cell is occupied until the segment moves out.\n\nFor the segment at index k, it will move when the head has moved k times, because each head move causes the segment to move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, segment at index 1 moves to where index 0 was after head moves.\n\nSimilarly, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on.\n\nSo for the cell at (2,2), occupied by segment index 4, it will be freed after 4 head moves, because after 4 moves, that segment will have moved to a new position, and the cell is free.\n\nAfter 4 head moves without eating, the tail has been removed 4 times, so the segment that was at index 4 is now at index 0 or something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt turn 52, positions: S0: (5,3), S1: (5,2), S2: (4,2), S3: (3,2), S4: (2,2), S5: (1,2), etc.\n\nAfter one move, say head moves to new position, S0 new, S1 becomes old S0, S2 becomes old S1, etc., S15 removed.\n\nSo after one move, S4 is now at old S3 position, which was (3,2)? Old S3 is (3,2), so new S4 is at (3,2), so the cell (2,2) is now occupied by S5? Let's not confuse.\n\nAfter head move, the new position for segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i>0.\n\nFor i=0, new position based on move.\n\nFor cells: the cell that was occupied by S15 (tail) is freed.\n\nThe cell that was occupied by S4 is now occupied by S5? No.\n\nAfter move, new S0 = new head position\n\nNew S1 = old S0\n\nNew S2 = old S1\n\nNew S3 = old S2\n\nNew S4 = old S3\n\nNew S5 = old S4\n\nand so on, up to new S15 = old S14, and old S15 is removed.\n\nIn this case, for cell (2,2), it was occupied by old S4.\n\nAfter move, new S4 = old S3 = (3,2)  (since old S3 is (3,2))\n\nNew S5 = old S4 = (2,2)\n\nSo new S5 is at (2,2), so (2,2) is still occupied, by new S5.\n\nSimilarly, after any move, the cell (2,2) is still occupied because the segment that was there is now at a different index, but the cell may have the same or different segment.\n\nIn this case, after one move, S5 is at (2,2), so still occupied.\n\nAfter two moves, it might be different.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be freed only when no segment is on it, which happens when the segment that was on it has moved away and no new segment comes, but since the snake is contiguous, it only happens when that position is the tail and is removed.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) is currently S4. S4 will become the tail after 12 moves, because there are 12 segments after it (S5 to S15, that's 11 segments, S5 to S15 is 11, plus S4 itself, so from S4 to tail, there are 12 segments? Indices S4 to S15 is 12 segments.\n\nS4 is the 5th segment, S5 to S15 is 11 segments, so S4 is 12 segments from the tail.\n\nAfter 12 head moves without eating, S4 will be the tail and be removed, freeing (2,2) at that point.\n\nBut if the snake eats food, it grows, so it takes longer.\n\nSince there is food at (2,2), when it is freed, the food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut for now, it's occupied.\n\nSo to eat (2,2), I need to free it first, which takes many turns, and it has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nLife span 7 from turn 52, so available until turn 58.\n\nAfter 12 moves, it would be turn 52+12=64, which is after turn 58, so it might disappear before being freed if I don't eat and grow.\n\nTurn 52: life span 7, so available on turns 52,53,54,55,56,57,58. Disappears after turn 58.\n\nOn turn 58, it is still available if not eaten.\n\nBut to free (2,2), if I never eat, after 12 moves, on turn 52+12=64, which is after 58, so on turn 58, the cell might still be occupied.\n\nLet's calculate when (2,2) is freed.\n\nCurrent turn 52, position S4 at (2,2).\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the segment that was at S4 will be at new position, and after m moves, it becomes the tail.\n\nInitially, distance from head: 4 steps (indices difference).\n\nAfter each move without eating, the distance decreases by 1, because the tail is removed.\n\nAfter d moves, the segment that was at distance d becomes the tail and is removed on the d-th move.\n\nFor example, segment at index i, distance i from head.\n\nAfter i moves without eating, it becomes the tail and is removed.\n\nHere, S4 at index 4, so after 4 moves without eating, on the 4th move, it becomes the tail and is removed, freeing the cell.\n\nOn turn 52, after 4 moves, on turn 56, S4 becomes the tail and is removed when no eat.\n\nLet's see:\n\nTurn 52: positions, S4 at (2,2)\n\nAfter one move no eat: new positions, S4 is now at old S3 position, but the cell (2,2) is occupied by new S5 (old S4)\n\nAfter two moves no eat: new S4 at old S3 of previous, etc.\n\nAfter k moves, the segment that was S4 is now at index 4-k if k<4, or removed if k=4.\n\nFor k=4, after 4 moves no eat, S4 has been shifted and is now the tail, and on the 4th move, it is removed.\n\nSo on turn 56, after 4th move, the cell (2,2) is freed, because the tail was removed from there or from wherever.\n\nWhen S4 is removed, it is removed from its current position, which may not be (2,2).\n\nInitially at turn 52, S4 at (2,2)\n\nAfter one move no eat: S4 moves to old S3 position, say P3, so (2,2) is now occupied by S5 (old S4)\n\nAfter two moves: S4 at P2, S5 at P3, (2,2) occupied by S6 or something.\n\nAfter 4 moves, S4 has been moved to the head position or something, and is removed as tail.\n\nThe cell (2,2) is freed only if no segment is on it, which depends on the path.\n\nBut in general, after 4 moves, the segment that was on (2,2) is gone, but other segments might be there if the snake moves over it.\n\nTo ensure (2,2) is free, I need to move the snake such that after 4 moves, no segment is on (2,2), which is likely if the snake doesn't double back.\n\nBut for now, it's complicated.\n\nFor turn 52, I should focus on available food: (4,6) and (6,5)\n\n(4,6) at (4,6), life span 4\n\n(6,5) at (6,5), life span 10\n\nHead at (5,3), direction U.\n\nTo reach (4,6): from (5,3) to (4,6), I need to move left and up.\n\nSimilarly to (6,5): right and up.\n\nAlso, the grid has an obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant immediately.\n\nNow, possible moves for turn 52: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), then I'm closer to both foods, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) but (5,5) will be gone, or L to (4,4) or R to (6,4), etc.\n\nIf I move L to (4,3), which is tail, then I'm at (4,3), which is closer to (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), then U to (4,5), then U to (4,6), so 3 moves to eat (4,6).\n\nLife span 4, so available for 4 turns including turn 52.\n\nOn turn 52, if I move to (4,3), I'm not eating (4,6) yet.\n\nTurn 52: move to (4,3), no eat.\n\nTurn 53: from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 54: U to (4,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 55: U to (4,6), eat.\n\nSo on turn 55, I eat (4,6), within life span.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (6,3) on turn 52, then to (6,4) on turn 53, to (6,5) on turn 54, eat on turn 54, life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut (4,6) has shorter life span, so I might prioritize it.\n\nAlso, need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's check if moving L to (4,3) is safe.\n\nMoving to (4,3), which is tail, allowed, no problem.\n\nAfter move, head at (4,3), body as before but shifted, tail at (3,3).\n\nNow, from (4,3), possible moves: since I moved L, which is left, so new direction L, so I can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite).\n\nL would be to (3,3), but (3,3) is now the tail, so I can move to it.\n\nU to (4,4), D to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is body, currently occupied by new S2 or something, let's see new positions after move L.\n\nPrevious positions: [ (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove head to (4,3), new head (4,3)\n\nBody: old head (5,3) becomes S1, then (5,2) S2, (4,2) S3, (3,2) S4, (2,2) S5, (1,2) S6, (1,3) S7, (1,4) S8, (1,5) S9, (1,6) S10, (2,6) S11, (2,5) S12, (2,4) S13, (2,3) S14, (3,3) S15, and old S15 (4,3) is gone, but head is there.\n\nNew positions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nTail at (3,3)\n\nFrom (4,3), move U to (4,4): free? (4,4) not in positions, so yes.\n\nMove D to (4,2): (4,2) is in positions, S3, body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nMove L to (3,3): (3,3) is tail, so can move to it.\n\nMove R to (5,3): but R is opposite to current direction L? Current direction after move is L, since I moved left to (4,3), so direction L.\n\nMoving R would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nL to (3,3) tail, U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, not tail, so deadly collision, cannot move D.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), body [ (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ], tail (3,3)\n\nHead at (6,3), direction R.\n\nCan move R, U, D, not L (opposite).\n\nR to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nU to (6,4), D to (6,2).\n\n(6,4) and (6,2) should be free, not in positions.\n\nNow, back to turn 52.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), new head (5,4), direction U.\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nU to (5,5) but (5,5) has food but life span 1, on turn 52, if I move to (5,5) on turn 53? On turn 52 I move to (5,4), on turn 53 I can move to (5,5), but (5,5) disappears after turn 52, so on turn 53 it's gone. So I can't eat it.\n\n(5,5) only available turn 52, missed.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go towards (4,6) or (6,5).\n\nTo (4,6): from (5,4) to (4,6) is left and up, e.g., L to (4,4), then U to (4,5), U to (4,6).\n\nOr U to (5,5) but gone, so not.\n\nTo (6,5): from (5,4) R to (6,4), then U to (6,5).\n\nOr U to (5,5) gone.\n\nNow, life span of (4,6) is 4, so I need to eat by turn 55.\n\nIf I move U on turn 52 to (5,4), then on turn 53 move L to (4,4), turn 54 U to (4,5), turn 55 U to (4,6), eat on turn 55.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 53 I move U from (5,4) to (5,5) but gone, or to (4,4) etc.\n\nBut (5,5) gone, so from (5,4), moving U to (5,5) on turn 53 is not possible, since food disappeared.\n\nSo only options are L or R or D, but direction U, so can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (5,5) not available, so effectively L or R from (5,4).\n\nL to (4,4) or R to (6,4).\n\nThen from there to food.\n\nSimilarly for other starting moves.\n\nNow, also, I need to consider the Tail Reward Danger, but no food on tail now.\n\nAnd long-term survival.\n\nThe snake is quite long, and the grid has limited space, especially with the left column occupied.\n\nLook at the snake positions: it has a lot of body on the left: from (1,2) to (1,6) and (2,3) to (2,6), so the left side is crowded.\n\nMoving right might be better to open space.\n\nFor example, if I move R to (6,3) on turn 52, then I can go to (6,5) soon.\n\nFrom (6,3), move U to (6,4) on turn 53, then U to (6,5) on turn 54, eat.\n\n(6,5) life span 10, no problem.\n\nIf I move to (4,6), it might be riskier because the top-left has body.\n\n(4,6) is at top, y=6, which is below y=7 wall, so y=6 is playable.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), I need to go to (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is current position if I move L, or from (5,4) if I move U first.\n\nBut let's think about the path to (4,6).\n\nFrom head (5,3), if I move L to (4,3) on turn 52, then U to (4,4) on turn 53, U to (4,5) on turn 54, U to (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nOn turn 55, eat.\n\nNow, is (4,4) free? Currently, not occupied, yes.\n\n(4,5) : not occupied, food is at (4,6), (6,5), etc., not (4,5), so free.\n\n(4,6) has food.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5) to (4,6) is up.\n\nBut when I move to (4,6), I eat, so snake grows.\n\nNow, need to check if there are risks.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,6), the tail grows, so I need to have space.\n\nBut let's not go too far yet.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,5), easier.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,2) will be available for a while, but I can eat it later.\n\nNow, for turn 52, I need to choose.\n\nAlso, moving to (4,3) or (6,3) might be better than (5,4) because (5,4) is in the middle, and I might get boxed in.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nList the occupied cells to see free space.\n\nPlayable area: x=1-6, y=1-6 except (3,1)\n\nOccupied snake: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nSo the left and bottom are filled.\n\nFree cells: for example, (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) has food, (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) food, (6,6), and (2,1), (3,1) obstacle, (4,1), (5,1), (1,1), etc.\n\ny=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) obstacle, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nFrom snake, (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) occupied, so (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) free? (3,1) obstacle.\n\n(1,1) free, (2,1) free, (4,1) free, (5,1) free, (6,1) free.\n\ny=2: (1,2) occupied, (2,2) occupied, (3,2) occupied, (4,2) occupied, (5,2) occupied, (6,2) free\n\ny=3: (1,3) occupied, (2,3) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (4,3) occupied, (5,3) occupied, (6,3) free\n\ny=4: (1,4) occupied, (2,4) occupied, (3,4) free, (4,4) free, (5,4) free, (6,4) free\n\ny=5: (1,5) occupied, (2,5) occupied, (3,5) free, (4,5) free, (5,5) free, (6,5) food\n\ny=6: (1,6) occupied, (2,6) occupied, (3,6) free, (4,6) food, (5,6) free, (6,6) free\n\nSo free cells: (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\nAnd (5,5) will disappear after turn 52.\n\nAlso (6,5) has food, (4,6) has food.\n\nNow, the snake is at (5,3), if I move U to (5,4), I go to a free cell, but then I might be surrounded if I go up.\n\n(5,4) is free, then from there, if I go U, (5,5) is free but disappearing, so on turn 53, (5,5) gone, so I can go to (5,5) but no food, or L to (4,4), R to (6,4), etc.\n\nIf I go to (5,4), I can then go to (4,4) or (6,4) to reach food.\n\nBut moving directly towards food might be better.\n\nSince (4,6) has shorter life span, I should prioritize eating it.\n\nLife span 4, so I need to eat by turn 55.\n\nFrom current position (5,3), the fastest way to (4,6) is to go left then up, e.g., move L to (4,3) on turn 52, then U to (4,4) on 53, U to (4,5) on 54, U to (4,6) on 55.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4) on 52, then L to (4,4) on 53, U to (4,5) on 54, U to (4,6) on 55, same number of turns.\n\nBut from (5,4) to (4,4) is left, which might be against direction if I moved U, but after moving U to (5,4), direction is U, so I can move L to (4,4), no problem.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (6,3) first would delay eating (4,6).\n\nFor (6,5), I can eat later.\n\nSo for turn 52, moving L to (4,3) or U to (5,4) both allow me to reach (4,6) by turn 55.\n\nMoving R to (6,3) would let me eat (6,5) faster but (6,5) has more time.\n\nSince (4,6) might be riskier to reach, let's check if the path is clear.\n\nTo (4,6): from (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6).\n\n(4,4) free, (4,5) free, (4,6) food.\n\nNo obstacles.\n\nBut after eating at (4,6), the snake grows, so length 17, and I'm at (4,6), which is top row.\n\nThen I need to find a way out without colliding.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), I can move L, R, D, not U (wall or out of bound).\n\ny=6, U would be to (4,7) which is y=7 wall, so invalid.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves L to (3,6), R to (5,6), D to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) free, (5,6) free, (4,5) free.\n\nBut (4,5) is where the neck was before eating, but after eating, the body is behind.\n\nWhen I eat at (4,6), new head (4,6), then body includes the previous head at (4,5) or something.\n\nLet's simulate after eating (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nAssume I am at (4,5) on turn 54, head, then move U to (4,6) on turn 55, eat.\n\nSo before move turn 55: head at (4,5), body following.\n\nAfter move to (4,6), eat, so new head (4,6), the previous head (4,5) becomes body, and no tail removed, so new segment added, positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), then previous body... ]\n\nPrevious on turn 54: head (4,5), then let's say from earlier, on turn 54 head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nFrom the path: turn 52: move to (4,3) or (5,4), but let's take moving L on turn 52.\n\nTurn 52: move L to (4,3)\n\nPositions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ] tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 53: move U to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), body [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ] tail (2,3)?

Disappears after turn 55, so on turn 56, it's gone.\n\nTurn 55 is the last chance.\n\nOn turn 55, if I am at (5,5), I can move to (4,5) or (5,6), not directly to (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,5) to (4,6) is not adjacent; (4,6) is left and up, but from (5,5), moving L to (4,5), then U to (4,6), but on turn 56, (4,6) gone.\n\nSo if I am at (5,5) on turn 55, I can move to (4,5) or (5,6) or (6,5) but (6,5) eaten, etc.\n\n(4,5) is free, but to reach (4,6) from (4,5) I need to move U on turn 56, but on turn 56, (4,6) disappeared.\n\nSo impossible to eat (4,6) if I go to (6,5) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,5) on turn 54, on turn 55 I can move to (5,5) or (6,6), but not to (4,6) directly.\n\nAnd (4,6) can only be reached from (4,5), (3,6), or (5,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (5,6) or (4,5), but not to (4,6) in one move.\n\nSo if I don't start moving towards (4,6) by turn 52 or 53, I cannot reach it in time.\n\nTherefore, to eat (4,6), I must begin moving towards it now.\n\nFor (6,5), I have more time.\n\nSo I should prioritize (4,6) since it has shorter life span.\n\nThus, for turn 52, I should move towards (4,6).\n\nEither move L to (4,3) or U to (5,4).\n\nMoving L to (4,3) is directly left, closer to x=4.\n\nMoving U to (5,4) is up, then left.\n\nBoth are fine, but moving L might be more direct.\n\nAlso, moving to (4,3) is moving to the tail, which is safe and frees a cell.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating (4,6), I can move to the right.\n\nBut let's commit to moving L on turn 52.\n\nThen as above, I can eat (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It says \"action on turn t1, action on turn t1+1, ...\" so probably for several turns, but not specified how many. Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=52.\n\nSo I need to output actions for turn 52,53,54,55,56, etc.\n\nBut I need to plan.\n\nSince the state may change after each move, especially after eating, I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut food life span decreases, so I need to consider.\n\nFor now, I'll plan to eat (4,6) by turn 55.\n\nSo turn 52: move L to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 53: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: move U to (4,6) and eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 56, I need to move from (4,6).\n\nAs before, can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\n(3,6) is free, (5,6) is free.\n\nMoving R to (5,6) might be better to avoid the left crowded area.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move U, but y=6, U to (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5), but (5,5) disappeared, so free.\n\nL to (4,6) body, no.\n\nR to (6,6).\n\nSo can move D to (5,5), or R to (6,6).\n\nSay move to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is now free, (6,6) free.\n\nThen I can go towards (6,5), but (6,5) is already eaten or not? (6,5) has life span 10, so still available.\n\nAfter eating (4,6) on turn 55, (6,5) is still there.\n\nOn turn 56, from (4,6), if I move R to (5,6), then head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen turn 57: from (5,6), can move D to (5,5), L to (4,6) body, no, R to (6,6), U invalid.\n\nSo move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf move D to (5,5), then to (5,4), etc., towards (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), from (5,5) move R to (6,5) on turn 58, eat.\n\nLife span 10, turn 52 to 61, so turn 58 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (2,2) later if possible.\n\n(2,2) life span 7, until turn 58.\n\nBut to eat (2,2), I need to free it and move head there.\n\nCurrently occupied, will be freed around turn 56 as earlier calculation.\n\nOn turn 52, S4 at (2,2), after 4 moves no eat, on turn 56, it is removed.\n\nIn the sequence, if I eat on turn 55 at (4,6), then the snake grows, so the segment removal is delayed.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 55 I eat at (4,6), so no tail removed, length increases.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) was S4 initially, but after moves, it shifts.\n\nInitially turn 52, S4 at (2,2)\n\nAfter turn 52 move L no eat: S4 moves to old S3 position, which is (3,2) in this case? In the move L to (4,3), new S4 = old S3 = (3,2), new S5 = old S4 = (2,2), so (2,2) occupied by S5.\n\nAfter turn 53 move U no eat: new S5 = old S4 = (3,2) or something, but in positions, after turn 53: as above, positions have S5 at (2,2)? Let's see.\n\nFrom earlier simulation:\n\nAfter turn 53: positions [ (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ] so (2,2) is S6? Index: head S0 (4,4), S1 (4,3), S2 (5,3), S3 (5,2), S4 (4,2), S5 (3,2), S6 (2,2), etc.\n\nSo S6 at (2,2)\n\nAfter turn 54 move U no eat: new positions [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ] so S7 at (2,2)? S0 (4,5), S1 (4,4), S2 (4,3), S3 (5,3), S4 (5,2), S5 (4,2), S6 (3,2), S7 (2,2)\n\nThen turn 55 move U to (4,6) and eat: so no remove, new head (4,6), body [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ] and new segment, so S16 at (2,4)? Positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ] so (2,2) is S8? S0 head (4,6), S1 (4,5), S2 (4,4), S3 (4,3), S4 (5,3), S5 (5,2), S6 (4,2), S7 (3,2), S8 (2,2), etc.\n\nSo (2,2) is still occupied by S8.\n\nTo free it, I need to have that segment moved away.\n\nSince I ate on turn 55, length 17, the segment at S8 will take longer to become tail.\n\nBut (2,2) has food, and life span 7, until turn 58.\n\nOn turn 58, it must be eaten or disappear.\n\nBut on turn 58, it is still occupied, so cannot eat unless freed.\n\nBut freeing might take many turns, and with growth, it might not be freed in time.\n\nFor example, the distance to tail: from S8 to tail, about 9 segments, so after 9 moves no eat, it becomes tail, but if I eat, it delays.\n\nSince life span short, and snake long, it might not be feasible to eat (2,2) in time, or risky.\n\nPerhaps ignore (2,2) for now.\n\nFocus on (4,6) and (6,5).\n\nFor the action sequence, I'll go for eating (4,6).\n\nSo turn 52: L\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U to eat (4,6)\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,6), move R to (5,6) (since moving left to (3,6) might be towards crowded area)\n\nThen turn 57: from (5,6), move D to (5,5) (since U invalid, L to (4,6) body, R to (6,6))\n\n(6,6) is free, (5,5) free.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 58: move R to (6,5) and eat.\n\n(6,5) life span 10, turn 58 is within, since available until turn 61.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut for now, output for 5+ turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output the first few actions.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to specify actions for each turn.\n\nPerhaps start with turn 52: L\n\nThen for turn 53, it depends, but since I planned, I can list.\n\nTo be safe, let's confirm the moves.\n\nFirst, on turn 52, move L to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 53, from (4,3), direction L, so can move U, D, L.\n\nBut D to (4,2) is body, not safe, so only U or L.\n\nL to (3,3) which is tail, or U to (4,4)\n\nI planned U to (4,4)\n\nSimilarly, turn 54 from (4,4), direction U, move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55 U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 56 from (4,6), direction U, but U invalid, so can move L, R, D.\n\nD to (4,5) body, so move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6)\n\nI choose R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 57 from (5,6), direction R (since moved right), can move R to (6,6), D to (5,5), not U or L (L to (4,6) body)\n\nSo move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6)\n\nI said D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 58 from (5,5), direction D (since moved down), can move D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5), not U.\n\n(6,5) has food, so move R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen and so on.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 57 or more.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output for the sequence.\n\nAlso, for turn 52, moving U to (5,4) is also possible, but moving L is more direct for (4,6).\n\nIn moving U first, from (5,4) I might have more options.\n\nBut let's stick with L.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 52: L\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nThen for turn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: D\n\nBut in turn 57, from (5,6) to (5,5), direction down.\n\nThen turn 58: R to (6,5)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food at (2,2) might not be eaten, and I have to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not in the path.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering food life spans and collision risks. The current state (turn 52) has the snake head at (5,3) moving upward (\"U\"). Key food items are:\n- (5,5) with life span 1 (disappears after turn 52, unreachable in one move, so ignored).\n- (4,6) with life span 4 (must be eaten by turn 55).\n- (6,5) with life span 10 (can be eaten later).\n- (2,2) with life span 7 (currently under snake body; eating it requires freeing the cell and may not be feasible by turn 58 due to snake length and movement constraints).\n\nThe snake is long (16 segments), and the grid has limited space, with the left side (x=1-2) crowded. Prioritizing (4,6) is critical due to its short life span. Moving left (\"L\") on turn 52 positions the snake closer to (4,6) efficiently. The sequence below ensures eating (4,6) by turn 55 and then heads toward (6,5) for a second food item, avoiding dead ends and leveraging open space on the right.\n\n### Planned Actions (5+ Turns)\n- **Turn 52: L (left)**  \n  Move to (4,3), which is the tail cell (safe). This avoids the crowded left area and starts the path to (4,6). After move: head at (4,3), direction L.\n\n- **Turn 53: U (up)**  \n  Move to (4,4), a free cell. From (4,3), moving U is safe and progresses toward (4,6). D (down) is invalid (leads to body collision at (4,2)), and L (left) to (3,3) is possible but less efficient for the target. After move: head at (4,4), direction U.\n\n- **Turn 54: U (up)**  \n  Move to (4,5), a free cell. Continues the path to (4,6). After move: head at (4,5), direction U.\n\n- **Turn 55: U (up)**  \n  Move to (4,6) and eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 17). This is within the life span (turn 55 is the last chance). After move: head at (4,6), direction U.\n\n- **Turn 56: R (right)**  \n  From (4,6), moving U is invalid (y=7 wall), D leads to body collision (at (4,5)), and L to (3,6) is possible but heads toward crowded left. Moving R to (5,6) is safer, accessing open space on the right. After move: head at (5,6), direction R.\n\n- **Turn 57: D (down)**  \n  From (5,6), U is invalid (y=7 wall), L leads to body collision (at (4,6)), and R to (6,6) is possible but delays reaching (6,5). Moving D to (5,5) positions for (6,5). After move: head at (5,5), direction D.\n\n- **Turn 58: R (right)**  \n  Move to (6,5) and eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 18). (6,5) is within life span (available until turn 61). From (5,5), moving R to (6,5) is direct and safe. After move: head at (6,5), direction R.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Prioritizes high-risk food**: (4,6) is eaten just before it disappears (turn 55), leveraging its full value.\n- **Avoids risks**: \n  - No movement into walls or body segments (except safe tail moves).\n  - The path avoids the crowded left side (x=1-2) after turn 56, reducing collision risk.\n  - (2,2) is not targeted; freeing it takes too long (estimated after turn 58), and eating it risks Tail Reward Danger or may not be possible within life span.\n- **Maximizes long-term survival**: \n  - After eating (4,6), moving right opens space in less crowded areas (x=5-6).\n  - (6,5) is eaten on turn 58, contributing to score without urgency.\n  - Future turns can explore remaining space (e.g., (3,6), (6,6), or bottom-right cells) with minimal risk.\n- **Efficiency**: The sequence uses minimal turns to reach food, with no wasted moves.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Food at (2,2)**: Life span 7 means it disappears after turn 58. However, with the snake length and current position, freeing (2,2) requires about 4-5 moves without eating, but growth from eating (4,6) and (6,5) delays this. By turn 58, (2,2) is likely still occupied or unreachable safely, so it is ignored.\n- **Contingency**: If unexpected obstacles arise (e.g., new food spawns), the AI can adapt after turn 58, but the grid has ample free cells (e.g., (3,4)-(3,6), (6,6)) for maneuvering.\n- **5+ turns planned**: The sequence covers 7 turns (52-58), ensuring (4,6) and (6,5) are eaten while maintaining safety.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 53: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 54: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 55: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 56: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 57: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 58: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 53, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning columns 0 and 7 are walls, and y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) inclusive? Let's confirm.\n\nBorder cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Therefore, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. That's a 6x6 grid? x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6, so yes, 6x6 cells.\n\nBut there's also an internal obstacle at (3,1). So (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: head is at (4,3), and direction is L, which is left, so moving west.\n\nSnake body: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nLet me list the positions in order: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). That's 16 segments.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so +1 each.\n\nLife span: (4,6) has 4 turns left, (2,2) has 6, (6,5) has 9.\n\nCurrent turn is 53, so food disappears after N turns including current, so for (4,6), it will disappear after turn 56? Life span N means it disappears after N turns from now, including the current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nSo if life span is 4 at turn 53, it decreases to 3 on turn 54, 2 on 55, 1 on 56, and disappears after turn 56, so it can be eaten on turns 53,54,55,56. Similarly for others.\n\nNow, snake head is at (4,3), moving left, so from (4,3), moving left would go to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is part of the snake body? Let's see the positions: head (4,3), then body: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is the last position, which is the tail.\n\nSince the snake is moving, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away, so if head moves to (3,3), which is currently occupied by the tail, that should be okay because the tail will move forward, freeing up that cell.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, where is the tail? The positions list: (3,3) is the last one, so tail is at (3,3).\n\nHead is at (4,3), tail at (3,3), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n\nIs there food at (3,3)? The food positions are (4,6), (2,2), (6,5). (3,3) is not listed, so no food there. So moving to (3,3) should be safe because tail will move.\n\nBut let's confirm the snake movement.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, left. So possible moves from (4,3): left to (3,3), up to (4,4), down to (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied by the body? Positions: (4,2) is the fourth segment? List: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), so (4,2) is a body segment.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is the tail at index 15.\n\nWhen snake moves, if head moves to (3,3), which is currently tail, but since tail moves, it becomes the new head position, and the old tail is removed, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to (4,4), which should be empty, or to (4,2), which is occupied by body.\n\n(4,2) is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,3) should be safe because it's the tail.\n\nMoving up to (4,4): is that free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nFirst, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacle (3,1).\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,1) blocked.\n\nSnake occupies: all positions listed: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (4,4) is not occupied, I think. Let's list all occupied cells from positions:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n- (3,2), (3,3)\n\n- (4,2), (4,3)\n\n- (5,2), (5,3)\n\nAnd head (4,3), tail (3,3)\n\n(4,4) is not in the list, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is tail.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,3) with current direction L (left):\n\n- Left to (3,3): since it's tail, should be safe.\n\n- Up to (4,4): free cell.\n\n- Down to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by body segment (index 3), so moving there would collide, death.\n\n- Right to (5,3): but (5,3) is the second segment, index 1, so occupied, death. Also, current direction is left, so moving right would be reverse, but rule says \"no instant reverse\", cannot move opposite on next turn. Since current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: Left or Up. Down and Right are invalid.\n\nNow, Left to (3,3) or Up to (4,4).\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food to consider: (4,6), (2,2), (6,5)\n\n(2,2) is occupied by the snake body? Positions: (2,2) is index 5, which is body segment. But food can be under body, and can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nFood at (2,2) with value 1, life span 6.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) and (6,5) are free, I think.\n\n(4,6): is it occupied? Snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), but not (4,6), so free.\n\n(6,5): not in positions, free.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move so that (2,2) is vacated, then head moves there.\n\nBut currently, (2,2) is the 6th segment? Positions index: 0: (4,3) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (2,2), so yes, (2,2) is a body segment.\n\nLife span 6, so it will disappear after turn 58? Current turn 53, life span 6: countdown 6 on turn 53, then 5 on 54, ..., 1 on 58, disappears after 58, so can be eaten on turns 53 to 58.\n\nBut since it's under body now, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from it.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nNow, my goal is to maximize score, so eat positive food, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,3), no food there.\n\nNow, let's think about possible paths.\n\nFirst, from current position (4,3), I can go left to (3,3) or up to (4,4).\n\nIf I go left to (3,3), new head at (3,3), which was tail. Then tail moves to where? After move, the tail is removed, so the new tail depends on the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, length same, tail removed.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,3): since (3,3) was tail, after head moves there, the new snake positions: head at (3,3), then the body segments shift, so the new body starts from old head (4,3), then (5,3), etc., and tail is the second last segment.\n\nCurrent positions: indices 0: (4,3) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (2,2), 6: (1,2), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (1,6), 11: (2,6), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,4), 14: (2,3), 15: (3,3) tail.\n\nIf head moves to (3,3), which is current tail position. Since no food eaten, new head at (3,3), and the segment that was at (4,3) becomes the new first body segment, so positions: new head (3,3), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). The tail was (3,3), but now head is there, and the last body segment is (2,3), so new tail at (2,3).\n\nOld tail (3,3) is now head, so it's removed from tail and becomes head, but the cell is the same, but in terms of positions, the new list is [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ] so 16 segments, tail at (2,3).\n\n(2,3) was index 14, now index 15.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (4,4), new head (4,4), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), etc., tail (2,3).\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 53.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (3,3)\n\n- New head at (3,3)\n\n- Direction was L, so now head direction is L.\n\n- Possible next moves from (3,3): current direction L, so can move L, U, D, but not R (reverse).\n\n(3,3): adjacent cells:\n\n- Left: (2,3) - but (2,3) is now the new tail? After move, positions have (2,3) as tail, so moving to (2,3) might be okay if it's tail.\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2) - (3,2) is a body segment, index 5 in new positions? New positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), ... so (3,2) is index 5, body, not tail. Tail is (2,3).\n\n- Right: (4,3) - but (4,3) is the first body segment, occupied, and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,3), with direction L:\n\n- Left to (2,3): (2,3) is tail, so should be safe.\n\n- Up to (3,4): free?\n\n- Down to (3,2): occupied by body, death.\n\n- Right: invalid.\n\n(3,4) is free? Current occupied: snake at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)\n\nSo (3,4) not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is tail.\n\nAlso, walls: (3,4) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,1), not relevant here.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible: L to (2,3) or U to (3,4).\n\nIf I go left to (3,3) at turn 53, then at turn 54, I can go to (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nBut (2,3) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nNow, food at (2,2) is on the body, but after this move, (2,2) is still occupied? After move to (3,3), positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), ... so (2,2) is index 6, body segment, so food under it, not eatable yet.\n\nLife span 6, so it has time.\n\nOption 2 at turn 53: Move Up to (4,4)\n\nNew head at (4,4), direction was L, but I moved U, so new direction U.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail at (2,3)\n\nFrom (4,4), direction U, possible moves:\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,3) - but (4,3) is first body segment, occupied, and also reverse? Direction U, down is opposite, so invalid.\n\n- Left to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (5,4) - but (5,4) may be free? Current occupied: (4,4) head, (4,3), (5,3), etc., (5,4) not in list, so free.\n\nAlso walls: x=5, y=4 is within 1-6.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,1) not relevant.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nDown invalid.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (4,6), which is above, life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 56.\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, x=4.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go up to (4,5), then to (4,6) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,5), life span 9, plenty of time.\n\nFood at (2,2) under body.\n\nAlso, tail at (2,3).\n\nNow, for long-term, I should aim to eat (4,6) soon since it has short life.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has longer life, but it's under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nBut (2,2) is deep in the body, so it might take time to expose it.\n\nLet's see the snake shape.\n\nThe snake is coiled: from head (4,3), to (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then right? (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3).\n\nSo it's like a filled area.\n\nTo free (2,2), I need the tail to move away, but tail is at (2,3) or after moves.\n\nCurrently after turn 53, if I move up to (4,4), tail at (2,3).\n\n(2,2) is occupied, and to eat it, head must be on (2,2) when it's free.\n\nBut (2,2) is surrounded: above (2,3), which is tail, but tail moves.\n\nPerhaps I can move the tail away.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,6). It's at (4,6), and I'm at (4,3) or (4,4).\n\nIf I go up to (4,4) at turn 53, then at turn 54 I can go up to (4,5), then at turn 55 to (4,6) to eat it.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nIf I go left to (3,3) at turn 53, then from (3,3), I can go up to (3,4), then to (3,5), etc., but (4,6) is at x=4, so I might not reach it directly, and life span is short.\n\nFrom (3,3) I can go up to (3,4), then to (4,4) or (3,5), but to reach (4,6), I need to go right or up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nTurn 53: if I move left to (3,3), then turn 54: from (3,3) I can move up to (3,4) or left to (2,3).\n\nIf I move up to (3,4), then at (3,4), direction U if I moved up.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go up to (3,5), left to (2,4), or right to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), so from (3,4) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6) would take turns 54,55,56.\n\nBut turn 56 is the last chance for (4,6), since life span 4: on turn 53 countdown 4, turn 54:3, turn 55:2, turn 56:1, after turn 56 disappears. So can be eaten on turn 56.\n\nIf I go to (4,6) on turn 56, I can eat it.\n\nBut from (3,3) at turn 54, if I go to (3,4), then turn 55 to (4,4), turn 56 to (4,5)? (4,5) is not (4,6).\n\n(4,6) from (4,5).\n\nIf at turn 54 I am at (3,4), I can go to (4,4) on turn 54? Turn 54 from (3,4).\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 53: start at (4,3)\n\nOption A: move left to (3,3) at turn 53.\n\nTurn 54: from (3,3), move up to (3,4)  // for example\n\nThen at turn 54, head at (3,4)\n\nNow, to reach (4,6), I need: from (3,4) to (4,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4) move right to (4,4)\n\nTurn 56: from (4,4) move up to (4,5)\n\nBut (4,6) is not reached yet. Turn 57: from (4,5) to (4,6), but on turn 57, (4,6) food has disappeared, since after turn 56 it's gone.\n\nLife span: on turn 53, countdown 4; after turn 53, if not eaten, countdown 3 on turn 54; after turn 54, countdown 2 on 55; after turn 55, countdown 1 on 56; after turn 56, countdown 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 56, but not after.\n\nSo to eat on turn 56, head must be on (4,6) on turn 56.\n\nIn the path above, on turn 56, head is at (4,5), not (4,6), so I miss it.\n\nIf from (3,4) at turn 54, I go up to (3,5), then turn 55 to (3,6) or (4,5), but (4,6) is at (4,6), so from (3,5) to (4,5) to (4,6) would be turn 55 and 56, but turn 55: from (3,5) to (4,5), turn 56: from (4,5) to (4,6), eat on turn 56.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 54, I can move right to (4,4) or up to (3,5), etc.\n\nIf I move up to (3,5) at turn 54, then at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 55: from (3,5), I can go up to (3,6), right to (4,5), or left to (2,5), down to (3,4) but reverse, invalid if direction U.\n\nDirection U, so can go U, L, R.\n\n(3,6) is y=6, which is border? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable, y=6 is top row, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 to 6.\n\nSo (3,6) is playable.\n\nFrom (3,5), move right to (4,5) at turn 55.\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,5) move up to (4,6) to eat.\n\nYes, so I can eat (4,6) on turn 56 if I go through (3,5) and (4,5).\n\nBut this requires that at turn 54 I am at (3,4) and move to (3,5), then turn 55 to (4,5), turn 56 to (4,6).\n\nBut at turn 53, if I moved left to (3,3), then turn 54 I need to move to (3,4) first, not directly to (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 54, if I move up to (3,4), then at turn 54 head at (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 55, from (3,4) I can move up to (3,5), then turn 56 to (4,5)? No, from (3,5) to (4,5) on turn 55 or 56.\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4) move up to (3,5)\n\nTurn 56: from (3,5) move right to (4,5)\n\nBut to eat (4,6), I need to be at (4,6) on turn 56, but at turn 56 I am at (4,5), so I can move to (4,6) on turn 57, but too late.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 56, I can move up to (3,6) or right to (4,5), not directly to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent to (3,5); (3,5) adjacent are (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5).\n\nTo reach (4,6) from (3,5), I need to go to (4,5) first or (3,6), then to (4,6) if possible.\n\nBut (4,6) from (4,5) or (3,6) or (5,6), etc.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can go to (4,5) on turn 56, then to (4,6) on turn 57, but turn 57 food is gone.\n\nTherefore, if I start by moving left at turn 53, I cannot reach (4,6) by turn 56; I can only be at (4,5) on turn 56 at best, missing the food.\n\nIf I go directly from (3,3) to (3,4) on turn 54, but I can't go faster.\n\nThe only way to eat (4,6) on turn 56 is to be at (4,5) on turn 55 or (4,6) earlier, but earlier not possible since life span.\n\nIf I am at (4,5) on turn 55, then on turn 56 I move to (4,6).\n\nTo be at (4,5) on turn 55.\n\nFrom current, turn 53.\n\nIf I move up to (4,4) at turn 53, then turn 54 I can move up to (4,5), then turn 55 to (4,6)? Turn 55: from (4,5) to (4,6) to eat.\n\nBut life span: on turn 55, countdown is 2? Turn 53: countdown 4, after turn 53 eaten or not? When is food eaten?\n\nFood is eaten when head moves onto the cell on that turn.\n\nSo on turn 53, if head at (4,6), eat.\n\nBut currently not at (4,6).\n\nAt turn 55, if head at (4,6), eat, and countdown on turn 55 is 2, so it can be eaten.\n\nLife span N at turn t, means it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, since after N turns it disappears.\n\nFor example, life span 4 at turn 53: can be eaten on turn 53 (countdown 4), 54 (3), 55 (2), 56 (1), and after turn 56, gone.\n\nSo turn 56 is last chance with countdown 1.\n\nSimilarly, turn 55 with countdown 2 is fine.\n\nIn the case where I move up at turn 53 to (4,4), then turn 54 to (4,5), then turn 55 to (4,6) to eat on turn 55.\n\nThat works, and I eat it before the last turn.\n\nIf I go left first, I can't reach until turn 56 or later, but on turn 56 I might reach if I go directly, but as above, I can be at (4,5) on turn 56 but not (4,6).\n\nSo only by moving up at turn 53 can I eat (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nTherefore, to get this food, I should move up at turn 53.\n\nBut I need to consider risks.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so length increases.\n\nNow, another food at (2,2) under body.\n\nCurrently occupied, life span 6, so can be eaten until turn 58.\n\nAfter I eat (4,6), the snake will be longer.\n\nBut (2,2) is at the body, so I need to move the tail or something to expose it.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,3) after some moves.\n\nAlso, food at (6,5) with life span 9, so I have time.\n\nBut let's see the grid and possible dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's plan for the immediate food.\n\nAt turn 53, move up to (4,4) to start heading towards (4,6).\n\nThen turn 54: from (4,4), direction U, I can move up to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55: from (4,5), move up to (4,6) to eat.\n\nNow, when I eat on turn 55, the snake grows, so new head at (4,6), and the tail does not move, so positions: after move to (4,6), since food eaten, length increases, so tail stays, and new segment added.\n\nAfter turn 54: suppose head at (4,5), positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), etc., tail (2,3) or wherever.\n\nAfter eating at (4,6) on turn 55: head moves to (4,6), food eaten, so new positions: head (4,6), then the previous head (4,5) becomes body, and all body segments, tail not removed, so length increases by one.\n\nPrevious positions at turn 54: let's trace.\n\nAt turn 53: move U to (4,4)\n\nPositions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail\n\nTurn 54: move U to (4,5)\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail\n\nNow turn 55: move U to (4,6)\n\n(4,6) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (4,6), then previous head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) and tail not removed, so 17 segments, tail still (2,3)? No, the last segment is (2,3), but since we added a new head, the body includes all previous, so positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ] so tail at (2,3), but (2,3) is now index 17.\n\nBut (2,2) is still occupied, index 9, body segment.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: up to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so death. Cannot move there.\n\nDown to (4,5) - but (4,5) is first body segment, occupied, and reverse direction? Direction U, down is opposite, invalid.\n\nLeft to (3,6)\n\nRight to (5,6)\n\n(3,6) and (5,6) may be free.\n\nCurrent occupied: as above, (4,6) head, (4,5), (4,4), etc., and (1,6), (2,6), etc.\n\n(3,6): is it occupied? Not in the list, so free.\n\n(5,6): not in list, free.\n\nAlso, walls: no issue.\n\nSo from (4,6), can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nCannot go U or D.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) and (2,2).\n\n(2,2) has life span 6, at turn 53, so by turn 58.\n\nTurn 55 now, so countdown for (2,2): on turn 55, countdown should be? Original life span 6 at turn 53.\n\nAfter turn 53, countdown 5 on 54, 4 on 55, 3 on 56, 2 on 57, 1 on 58, gone after 58.\n\nSo on turn 55, countdown 4, so can be eaten on 55,56,57,58.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 9 at turn 53, on turn 55 countdown 7.\n\nNow, (2,2) is still under body, at position index 9 in current snake.\n\nTo eat it, I need to have (2,2) free and head there.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is occupied, and it will be freed when the snake moves away from it, but since it's not the tail, it might take time.\n\nThe tail is at (2,3), which is adjacent.\n\nIf I move the tail, (2,2) might be exposed later.\n\nBut let's see the area around (2,2): it's at (2,2), with (1,2) above? y=2, x=2.\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3)\n\n(1,2) is occupied by snake, (3,2) occupied, (2,1): y=1, x=2, is it wall? Walls at y=0, but y=1 is not wall, but internal obstacle? Internal obstacle at (3,1), not (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is free? But let's see.\n\nFirst, walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7; internal (3,1).\n\nSo (2,1) is not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: from above, after turn 55, positions include (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), but not (2,1), so (2,1) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is tail.\n\n(2,3) is tail, and if I move the head towards there, I might be able to free (2,2).\n\nFor example, if I move the tail away from (2,3), then (2,2) could be freed later.\n\nBut (2,2) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the segment at (2,2) will only move if the part before it moves.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (2,2) is connected; when the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nIn this case, since (2,2) is not the head or tail, it stays occupied until the snake moves such that the segment that was at (2,2) moves to another cell.\n\nFor example, in the current positions after turn 55, (2,2) is the 10th segment? Positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail.\n\nSo (2,2) is index 9, (1,2) is index 10, etc.\n\nWhen snake moves, if head moves to a new cell, say to (3,6) or (5,6), then the body shifts: the segment that was at (4,6) moves to where head was, but head moves, so each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSpecifically, the first body segment (4,5) moves to the old head position? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second to the old first body position, and so on, until the tail, which is removed if no food eaten.\n\nIn this case, after turn 55, if no food eaten on turn 56, head moves to new cell, say (3,6), then new positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) and tail (2,3) is removed, so (2,2) is still there, but at new index.\n\n(2,2) is now index 10 or something, still occupied.\n\nTo free (2,2), I need the snake to move such that the segment that is at (2,2) moves away, which means that the part of the snake before it must move, and it will take multiple moves for that segment to be the tail and move away.\n\nSince (2,2) is fixed in position until the snake body shifts.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be free only when the segment that occupies it moves to another cell, which happens when the snake moves and that segment is not the tail.\n\nBut it will be freed when it becomes the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nCurrently, after turn 55, (2,2) is index 9, and tail is index 17 at (2,3), so there are 8 segments after it, so it will take at least 8 moves for (2,2) to become the tail, and then one more move to free it.\n\nAfter each move, the tail is removed, so the segment that was at (2,2) will move to the position of the previous segment in front of it each time the snake moves without eating.\n\nLet k be the index from head; head index 0, tail index L-1.\n\nThe segment at position i will move to the position of segment i-1 when the head moves, for i from 1 to L-1.\n\nThen the tail is removed.\n\nFor a body segment at a cell, it will be freed when that segment moves to a different cell, which happens every move, but the cell is reoccupied by the next segment if there is one.\n\nThe cell is free only when no segment is on it.\n\nFor (2,2), it is occupied by the 9th segment (from head, index 8 if 0-based? Positions list: index 0: head, 1: (4,5), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (2,2), 9: (1,2), 10: (1,3), etc. up to 17: (2,3)\n\nSo (2,2) is at index 8.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if head moves to a new cell, the segment at index 1 moves to index 0 old position, index 2 to index 1 old position, ..., index 8 to index 7 old position, and so on, up to index 17 moving to index 16 old position, and the tail index 17 is removed.\n\nSo the cell that was occupied by index 8 ( (2,2) ) will now be occupied by index 9 moving to that position? After move, the new index 8 will be the old index 9, which was (1,2), so (1,2) moves to (2,2), so (2,2) is still occupied, by the segment that was at (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, the cell is only freed when the tail moves away from it, but since the tail is at (2,3), and it moves, (2,3) might be freed if not reoccupied.\n\nBut for (2,2), it remains occupied until the segment that is destined to be there moves or something.\n\nActually, the cell (2,2) will be occupied as long as there is a body segment on it, which will be until that segment is the tail and the tail moves away without the new tail being there.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at index 8 will be at (2,2) until it moves to the position of index 7, which happens when the snake moves and index 8 becomes index 7 in the new list, and so on.\n\nIt will take exactly the number of moves equal to the distance from head to that segment for it to become the tail.\n\nSince index 8 is 8 positions from head, it will take 8 moves for this segment to be the tail (when head has moved 8 times, this segment is at index 0, but it's the position that changes).\n\nAfter k moves, the segment that was at index k will be at the tail position and then removed on the next move.\n\nFor example, after 0 moves, index 8 is at (2,2)\n\nAfter 1 move, the segment that was index 8 is now at index 7, which is the position of old index 7, (3,2)? Old index 7 is (3,2), so new index 7 is old index 8, which was at (2,2), but moves to the position of old index 7, which is (3,2), so now it is at (3,2)\n\nSimilarly, the cell (2,2) is now occupied by new index 8, which is old index 9, (1,2), moving to (2,2)\n\nSo the cell (2,2) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n\nIt will always be occupied until the segment that is the last to occupy it moves away when it becomes the tail.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be free only when the tail is at (2,2) and then the tail moves away.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,3), not at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is index 8, tail is index 17.\n\nThe tail will reach (2,2) after 9 moves, because from index 17 to index 8, difference 9 positions, so after 9 moves, the segment that is now index 8 will be at index 17-9=8? Let's think.\n\nAfter m moves, the segment that was at position i is now at position i - m if i-m >=0, or removed.\n\nFor the cell (2,2), it is currently occupied by the segment at index 8.\n\nAfter m moves, this segment will be at index 8 - m.\n\nWhen 8 - m = -1, it means it was removed after m=8 moves? Index from 0.\n\nAfter m moves, the segment that was at index k is now at index k - m for k-m >=0, or if k-m <0, it has been removed.\n\nSpecifically, after m moves, segments with original index <= m-1 have been removed or shifted.\n\nThe segment at original index k will be at new index k - m after m moves, for k >= m.\n\nFor k < m, it has been removed.\n\nFor example, after 1 move, original index 0 (head) is gone, new head is the new position.\n\nOriginal index 1 is now at index 0, index 2 at index 1, etc., up to index 17 at index 16, and index 17 removed.\n\nFor the segment at original index 8, after 1 move, it is at new index 8 - 1 = 7.\n\nAfter 2 moves, at index 6, and so on, until after 8 moves, it is at new index 8-8=0, so it is the head? No.\n\nAfter m moves, the segment that was at index k is now at index k - m.\n\nWhen k - m = 0, it is the head.\n\nWhen k - m = -1, it has been removed.\n\nFor original index 8, after 8 moves, it is at index 0, so it is the head.\n\nAfter 9 moves, it is removed, but it was the head at move 8.\n\nBut we care about the cell (2,2).\n\nThe cell (2,2) is occupied as long as some segment is on it.\n\nIt will be vacated when the segment that is on it moves away and no other segment moves to it.\n\nSince the snake is contiguous, the cell will be free only when the tail is at (2,2) and then the tail moves away without the head or body moving to it immediately, but in this case, when the tail moves from (2,2), the cell is freed.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,3), and (2,2) is occupied by index 8.\n\nThe tail will move to (2,2) when index 8 becomes the tail.\n\nIndex 8 will be the tail after how many moves?\n\nCurrent tail is index 17.\n\nThe distance from index 8 to index 17 is 9 positions (indices 8 to 17 inclusive is 10 segments, but the index difference is 9).\n\nAfter d moves, the current index i will be at position i - d in the new list.\n\nWhen i - d = L-1, it is the tail, where L is current length.\n\nCurrent L=17 after turn 55.\n\nIndex 17 is tail.\n\nFor index 8 to be the tail, it must be at position 16 in new indexing, but let's set.\n\nAfter m moves, the segment that was at index k is now at index k - m.\n\nThe tail is at index L-1 - m for the new length, but when no food eaten, length decreases? No, length is constant when no food eaten, but when no food, tail is removed, so length decreases by 1 per move without food.\n\nIn this case, after turn 55, L=17.\n\nIf no food eaten, each move, length decreases by 1 as tail is removed.\n\nAfter first move without food, L=16, tail at new index 15.\n\nThe segment that was at original index k will be at new index k - 1 after one move, for k >=1, and original index 0 is gone.\n\nFor the cell (2,2), it is occupied by the segment at original index 8.\n\nAfter 1 move, this segment is at new index 7, and the cell it occupies is the position of old index 7, which is (3,2), so (2,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at original index 9, moving to (2,2).\n\nAfter 2 moves, original index 8 is at new index 6, at position of old index 6, (4,2), and (2,2) is occupied by original index 10, and so on.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be occupied until the segment that is the last to be on it moves away when it becomes the tail.\n\nSpecifically, the segment that is currently at (1,2) (index 9) will move to (2,2) on the first move, then on subsequent moves, other segments move to (2,2), until the segment that was at (2,3) or something.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be free when the tail is at (2,2) and then the tail moves to another cell.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,3).\n\nThe tail will be at (2,2) when the segment that is now at (2,2) becomes the tail.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) is index 8, and tail is index 17, so it will take 9 moves for index 8 to become the tail, because after 9 moves, original index 8 will be at index 8-9= -1, which means it was removed after 8 moves? Let's calculate.\n\nAfter m moves, the segment at original index k is removed when m > k, or at index k-m for m <= k.\n\nFor k=8, after m moves:\n- if m <=8, it is at index 8-m\n- if m >8, it has been removed.\n\nIt is the tail when it is at index L-1 - (m - c) but it's messy.\n\nSince the tail moves forward each move, the position (2,2) will be the tail after the snake has moved such that the tail is at (2,2).\n\nCurrently, the path from head to tail is long, but the tail is at (2,3), and (2,2) is one cell away, but occupied.\n\nThe tail can move to (2,2) if the head moves in a way that the body shifts and the tail position changes.\n\nFor example, if the head moves and the second last segment is at (2,2), then tail can move to (2,2).\n\nBut currently, the segment before tail is (2,4), at index 16.\n\nPositions: index 16: (2,4), index 17: (2,3) tail.\n\nSo to have tail at (2,2), the segment at (2,2) must be the one before tail at some point.\n\nIt will take many moves.\n\nPerhaps it's not efficient to try to eat (2,2) soon, since it's deep in the body and life span is 6, but turn 55, countdown 4, so by turn 58.\n\nBut with the snake size, it might be tight.\n\nFood at (6,5) is free and has long life, so I can go for that.\n\nBack to turn 53 decision.\n\nIf I move up at turn 53 to (4,4), then turn 54 to (4,5), turn 55 to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen at (4,6), I need to move to (3,6) or (5,6).\n\nLet's see which is better.\n\nFirst, (3,6): from (3,6), I can go down or left or right, but not up (wall).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) similar.\n\nFood at (6,5) is at (6,5), which is near.\n\nFrom (4,6), if I move right to (5,6), then I can go down to (5,5), then to (6,5) to eat (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6) I can go right to (4,6) but occupied, or down to (3,5), etc., but (6,5) is farther.\n\nSo moving right to (5,6) might be better to reach (6,5).\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant for now.\n\nBut I need to consider the risk of trapping myself.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the left and bottom, so the right side is more open.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), head at (4,6), if I move to (5,6), then to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, after turn 55, tail at (2,3), no food.\n\nBut if I go towards (6,5), I might be safe.\n\nIf I had moved left at turn 53 to (3,3), I might not get the (4,6) food, and I might be in a worse position.\n\nFor example, at (3,3), I could go up to (3,4), then I have options, but I miss the food.\n\nSince (4,6) has short life, it's better to eat it.\n\nAlso, score is important.\n\nMoreover, by moving up, I avoid potential collision or dead end.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (3,3), which is tail, safe, but then I am at (3,3), and I have to move, say to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nIf I move to (2,3), which is tail, safe, but then at (2,3), I can go to (2,4) or (1,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by body, so cannot, and (1,3) is occupied, (2,4) may be free or not.\n\nAfter moving left to (3,3) at turn 53, positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail\n\nThen turn 54: move to (2,3) which is tail, new head (2,3), then body (3,3), (4,3), etc., tail (2,4)? New positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) tail\n\n(2,2) is still occupied.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move to (2,4) or (1,3) or (2,2) or (3,3), but (3,3) is body, (1,3) body, (2,2) body, only (2,4) is tail? (2,4) is tail, so moving to (2,4) is safe, or I can go down to (2,2) but occupied, death, or left to (1,3) occupied, death, or up to (2,4) which is tail.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4) is up, y+1.\n\ny=3 to y=4.\n\nSo only possible move to (2,4) which is tail.\n\nThen after that, I am at (2,4), and so on.\n\nBut it might lead to a corner.\n\nWhereas moving up to (4,4) opens more space.\n\nMoreover, with food at (4,6) to eat.\n\nTherefore, at turn 53, I should move Up.\n\nThen at turn 54, from (4,4) with direction U, move Up to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55, from (4,5) move Up to (4,6) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, at turn 56, from (4,6) with direction U, I need to move Left to (3,6) or Right to (5,6).\n\nNow, which one?\n\nFood at (6,5) is at (6,5), which is bottom-right.\n\nIf I move right to (5,6), then I can go down to (5,5), then right to (6,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,6), I have to go down to (3,5), then right to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied, or to (3,4), etc., which might take longer to reach (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has life span 9, turn 53, so at turn 56, countdown 6, plenty of time.\n\nBut moving right might be more direct.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), from (5,6), direction R (since I moved right from (4,6)).\n\nThen I can move down to (5,5), since U and D are not reverse, direction R, so can move U, D, L, but not R reverse? Direction is the direction I moved to get there.\n\nFrom (4,6) I move right to (5,6), so new direction R.\n\nThen from (5,6), possible moves: right to (6,6), up invalid (wall or reverse? y=6, up to y=7 wall, so cannot, since wall.\n\nDown to (5,5)\n\nLeft to (4,6) but occupied, and reverse direction, invalid.\n\nSo only down to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move down, left, right.\n\nTo (5,4), (6,5), or (4,5), but (4,5) may be occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is food.\n\nSo I can go directly to (6,5).\n\nIf I move left from (4,6) to (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move down to (3,5), left to (2,6) but may be occupied, or right to (4,6) occupied invalid.\n\nSo only down to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,4), (3,6) invalid, (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is occupied, so to (3,4) or (2,5) or (4,5) invalid.\n\nThen to reach (6,5) is longer.\n\nSo better to move right to (5,6) at turn 56.\n\nThen turn 57 to (5,5), then turn 58 to (6,5) to eat.\n\nNow, about (2,2) food, it might not be worth it since it's under body and time is short; by turn 58, countdown 1, but I may not be able to eat it if not freed.\n\nBut with the moves, it might be difficult, and I have other food.\n\nSo I can ignore (2,2) for now.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 53.\n\nSince I need to output for several turns, but it depends on the state.\n\nI can output the sequence based on the plan.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn 53: Move Up to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: Move Up to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: Move Up to (4,6) eat food\n\nTurn 56: Move Right to (5,6)\n\nNow, from there, I can continue.\n\nBut at turn 56, after move to (5,6), positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 55, positions as before.\n\nTurn 56: move right to (5,6), no food, so new head (5,6), then body (4,6), (4,5), etc., tail removed, so tail was (2,3), removed, new tail at (2,4) or something.\n\nBut (2,2) still occupied.\n\nThen turn 57: from (5,6), direction R, only down to (5,5) possible.\n\nMove Down to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 58: from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) to eat, since (6,5) has food.\n\n(6,5) is free? Yes.\n\nSo eat on turn 58.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut for the output, I think I need to provide actions for turn 53 to, say, 5 turns or so.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions, probably for as many as I can, but it might be state-dependent.\n\nI can output for turn 53 to 58 or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps for now, I can output up to turn 56 or 57.\n\nBut I think for the decision at turn 53, moving Up is best.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nThen at turn 56, I said move R to (5,6)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 55, from (4,6), I move R.\n\nThen turn 57: move D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 58: move R to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, since the state changes, I might not need all, but I think providing the immediate actions is fine, with the plan.\n\nSince the question says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should show the plan.\n\nBut in answer format, it lists turns.\n\nNow, another thing: at turn 55, after eating (4,6), head at (4,6), and I move to (5,6) or (3,6).\n\nI chose (5,6) to go to (6,5).\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,6), then to (5,5), then to (6,5), but (6,5) is at x=6, which is not wall, x=6 is playable since walls x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok.\n\ny=5 ok.\n\nThen after eating, I can move away.\n\nBut let's see if the snake can get stuck.\n\nThe snake body is long, but the area on the right is free.\n\nFor example, cells like (3,1) blocked, but (6,5) is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving left to (3,6) to avoid the right side, but (6,5) is there, so I need to go there.\n\nMoving to (5,6) is fine.\n\nNow, about the food at (2,2), I probably can't eat it in time, so I'll leave it.\n\nLife span 6 at turn 53, by turn 58 it disappears, and I'm at (6,5) on turn 58, far away.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nThen turn 57: D (down to (5,5))\n\nBut turn 57 is after, I can include.\n\nSince the output should start from turn 53, and I need to specify actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo for turn 53, 54, 55, 56, etc.\n\nI think for 5 turns: 53 to 57.\n\nBut at turn 56, from (4,6), I move R.\n\nThen turn 57 from (5,6) move D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 58 to (6,5), but that's turn 58.\n\nPerhaps up to turn 57 is fine.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output the actions taken.\n\nI think I should output:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nThen for turn 57, it depends, but from above, I would move D to (5,5)\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAfter turn 56 move to (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen at (5,6), walls: up y=7 wall, left to (4,6) occupied, right to (6,6) but x=6,y=6, which is within bounds? x=6 not wall, x=7 wall, so (6,6) is playable.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nFrom (5,6), with direction R, possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down: to (5,5)\n\n- Left: to (4,6) occupied and reverse, invalid\n\n- Right: to (6,6)\n\n(6,6) is free? Not occupied by snake or wall.\n\nSo I can move right to (6,6) or down to (5,5).\n\nIn my earlier plan, I wanted to go to (6,5), so moving down to (5,5) is better.\n\nI can move right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), but that takes an extra move.\n\nSince (6,5) is at (6,5), from (5,6) I can go down to (5,5), then to (6,5).\n\nOr from (5,6) go right to (6,6), then down to (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) is food, so I should go directly if possible, but not adjacent.\n\n(5,6) to (6,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, so must go through (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nShortest is down to (5,5), then right to (6,5).\n\nSo at turn 57, from (5,6) move down to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 58 move right to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, since turn 57 is t1+4, I can include.\n\nt1=53, so t1+1=54, etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 53, I think moving U is clear.\n\nIn the beginning, I had the option to move left, but I would miss the food.\n\nTo be thorough, if I move left at turn 53, I go to (3,3), then I might go up to (3,4), etc., but I can't get (4,6), and (2,2) is hard to get, so score lower.\n\nSo better to move up.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nThen turn 56: R (to (5,6))\n\nBut at turn 56, from (4,6), I could move L to (3,6), but I think R is better.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I'll go with R.\n\nThen turn 57: D (down to (5,5))\n\nBut for the box, I think up to turn 56 or 57.\n\nThe answer should include multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: 53 to 57.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: D  // to (5,5)\n\nThen implicitly, turn 58: R to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut I think that's fine.\n\nNow, in the state, snake head direction: at turn 53, direction is L, I move U, so new direction U.\n\nThen turn 54 move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 55 move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 56 move R, so direction changes to R.\n\nThen turn 57 move D, which is not reverse, since direction R, down is perpendicular.\n\nOk.\n\nNo instant reverse issue.\n\nAlso, no collision.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - Food at (4,6) has a short life span (disappears after turn 56) and is accessible by moving up immediately. Eating it on turn 55 is feasible and adds +1 to the score.\n  - Food at (2,2) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately. Freeing it would require multiple moves, and with a life span ending after turn 58, it is risky and time-consuming to pursue given the snake's current position and length. It is safer to ignore this food for now.\n  - Food at (6,5) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 61) and can be targeted after eating (4,6). Moving right from (4,6) sets up a path to (6,5).\n\n- **Movement and Collision Risks**:\n  - At turn 53, the snake head is at (4,3) with direction left. Possible moves are left to (3,3) (tail, safe) or up to (4,4) (free). Moving down to (4,2) or right to (5,3) causes body collision or is invalid due to reverse movement.\n  - Moving up to (4,4) allows access to (4,6) by turn 55, avoiding the loss of this food.\n  - After eating (4,6) on turn 55, moving right to (5,6) avoids walls and body collisions, and sets up a path to (6,5) for future turns.\n  - Moving left at turn 53 would miss the (4,6) food and potentially trap the snake in the crowded left side of the grid.\n\n- **Long-Term Survival**:\n  - The path up then right keeps the snake in open areas, reducing collision risks. The right side of the grid (e.g., (5,6), (5,5), (6,5)) has fewer obstacles and more space to maneuver.\n  - After turn 57, moving down to (5,5) and then right to (6,5) on turn 58 eats the (6,5) food, adding another +1. Further turns can focus on exploring open areas to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe planned moves for turns 53 to 57 are:\n\n- **Turn 53**: Move Up (U) to (4,4) to start heading toward (4,6).\n- **Turn 54**: Move Up (U) to (4,5) to position for eating (4,6) next turn.\n- **Turn 55**: Move Up (U) to (4,6) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases).\n- **Turn 56**: Move Right (R) to (5,6) to avoid walls and body, and begin path to (6,5).\n- **Turn 57**: Move Down (D) to (5,5) to continue toward (6,5) efficiently.\n\nThis sequence eats one food by turn 55 and sets up for a second food by turn 58, while avoiding all immediate risks. Beyond turn 57, the next move (turn 58) should be Right (R) to (6,5) to eat the food there if no new risks emerge.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 53\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57\\text{: D} }",

        "step": 54,
        "score": 15,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 54, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't move to those cells. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is U (up), so currently moving upwards.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,6) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 54, life span is 3, meaning it will be gone after turn 56? Let me clarify: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so after turn t + N - 1 or something? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span is L, then at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So for (4,6), at turn 54, life span=3, so it will be there for turns 54,55,56, and disappear after turn 56 (so not on turn 57).\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has value 1, life span 5, so available from turn 54 to 58 (since 5 turns: 54,55,56,57,58).\n\nAnd (6,5) with value 1, life span 8, available for many turns.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food here. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells (0,y), (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x, are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Let's list them in order:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nThen (4,3) — directly below head? Head is at (4,4), moving up, so previous position was down, but let's see the list.\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nSo from head to tail: (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6) -> (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3)\n\nTail is at (2,3).\n\nNow, head at (4,4), direction U, so it just moved up to (4,4) from (4,3)? Positions list: index 0 is head, so at turn 54, head is at (4,4), which it just moved to, so previous head position was (4,3) at turn 53, but (4,3) is now the second segment.\n\nDirection is U, meaning it moved up to (4,4).\n\nNow possible moves from (4,4): since direction is U, I can go U (up to (4,5)), L (left to (3,4)), R (right to (5,4)). Cannot go D (down to (4,3)) because that's opposite direction and also it's the body, but the rule is no instant reverse, so I cannot move down because it's opposite to current direction U.\n\nCurrent head direction U, so I cannot move D on the next turn.\n\nAlso, moving into body is deadly, except for the tail, because tail moves.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are occupied by snake.\n\nFrom positions: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: let's list them:\n\n- Row y=4: (4,4), (1,4), (2,4)\n\ny=4: (4,4) head, (1,4), (2,4)\n\ny=3: (4,3), (5,3), (1,3), (2,3) tail\n\ny=2: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (4,6) value 1, life span 3 (turns 54,55,56)\n\n- (2,2) value 1, life span 5 (turns 54 to 58)\n\n- (6,5) value 1, life span 8 (turns 54 to 61)\n\n(2,2) is a food position, but (2,2) is also a snake body segment? Snake positions include (2,2), which is the 7th segment or something. Positions: index 0: (4,4), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (2,2), etc.\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied by the snake body. Food is at (2,2), but the snake is on it? That must be a special case.\n\nCore rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for (2,2), food is under the snake body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, other food is not under snake, I think.\n\n(4,6) is not occupied by snake, (6,5) not occupied.\n\n(2,2) is occupied, so it's covered.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (2,3), and (2,2) has food under it? (2,2) is not tail; tail is (2,3).\n\nTail is (2,3), and (2,2) is a body segment with food under it.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from head (4,4) direction U.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R. Cannot D.\n\n- U: to (4,5)\n\n- L: to (3,4)\n\n- R: to (5,4)\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, (4,5): is it wall? x=4,y=5, not border or obstacle. Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (4,5) is within 0-7, and not (3,1), so ok. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: y=5 has (1,5) and (2,5), not (4,5), so free. So (4,5) is safe to move.\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4. Not border. Internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,4) is different, so ok. Snake? y=4: (4,4), (1,4), (2,4), no (3,4), so free. Safe.\n\n(5,4): x=5,y=4. Not border, not obstacle. Snake? y=4: positions at (4,4), (1,4), (2,4), no (5,4), so free. Safe.\n\nAll three moves seem safe immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, food at (4,6) is close, life span 3, so I should consider eating it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has food under it, but I need to move the body away first.\n\n(6,5) is farther.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (4,6). It's at (4,6), head at (4,4), so if I move up twice, I can reach it: to (4,5) then to (4,6).\n\nBut life span 3, so I can eat it on turn 54,55, or 56.\n\nIf I move U to (4,5) on turn 54, then on turn 55 I can move U to (4,6) to eat it, assuming it's still there.\n\nSince life span decreases each turn, at turn 54, life span=3, so after turn 54, it will have life span 2 on turn 55, and so on. So it can be eaten on turn 54,55,56.\n\nTurn 54: head at (4,4), I can move to (4,5), not directly to (4,6).\n\nTo eat on turn 54, I need to be at (4,6), but I'm at (4,4), so impossible this turn.\n\nEarliest I can eat is turn 55: if I move to (4,5) on turn 54, then to (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nOr later.\n\nBut life span 3, so if I don't eat by turn 56, it disappears.\n\nNow, is moving to (4,5) safe? Yes, as above.\n\nBut after moving to (4,5), what about the next moves.\n\nAlso, tail is at (2,3), and snake is long, 16 segments.\n\nI need to think about the path.\n\nAnother food at (2,2), but it's under the snake body at (2,2), which is position index 6.\n\nTo eat that, I need the body to move away from (2,2), and then head to move there.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (2,2) will move when the snake moves.\n\nWhen the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, when head moves from (4,4) to a new position, say (4,5), then the new positions will be: head at (4,5), then segment 1 at (4,4) (previous head), segment 2 at (4,3) (previous seg1), and so on, down to tail.\n\nCurrent positions: let's index them for clarity.\n\nAt turn 54:\n\nHead: P0 = (4,4)\n\nP1 = (4,3)\n\nP2 = (5,3)\n\nP3 = (5,2)\n\nP4 = (4,2)\n\nP5 = (3,2)\n\nP6 = (2,2)\n\nP7 = (1,2)\n\nP8 = (1,3)\n\nP9 = (1,4)\n\nP10 = (1,5)\n\nP11 = (1,6)\n\nP12 = (2,6)\n\nP13 = (2,5)\n\nP14 = (2,4)\n\nP15 = (2,3)  // tail\n\nAfter one move, say to (4,5), new positions:\n\nHead: (4,5)\n\nThen P0 becomes body: (4,4)\n\nP1 becomes (4,3)? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, the body segments follow: the new segment 1 is the old head position, new segment 2 is old segment 1, and so on, up to new tail which is old second to last or something.\n\nStandard snake: after move, new head at new position, then each body segment takes the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for move to (4,5):\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (5,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (5,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (4,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (3,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (2,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (1,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (1,3)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (1,4)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (1,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (1,6)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (2,6)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (2,5)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (2,4)  // new tail, since old P15 is dropped? Total segments 16, after move, snake grows only if it eats food, otherwise same length.\n\nIf no food eaten, when head moves, tail moves away from its position, so the last position is vacated.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten on this move, so the tail, old P15 (2,3) is left, and new tail is old P14 (2,4) at position new seg15.\n\nLet's list new positions after moving to (4,5) with no eat:\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew body:\n\n- Seg1: (4,4)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (4,3)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (5,3)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (5,2)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (4,2)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (3,2)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (2,2)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (1,2)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (1,3)  // old seg8\n\n- Seg10: (1,4)  // old seg9\n\n- Seg11: (1,5)  // old seg10\n\n- Seg12: (1,6)  // old seg11\n\n- Seg13: (2,6)  // old seg12\n\n- Seg14: (2,5)  // old seg13\n\n- Seg15: (2,4)  // old seg14\n\nOld seg15 (2,3) is no longer part of snake, so vacated.\n\nNow, the food at (2,2) is still under the body? New seg7 is at (2,2), which was old seg6, and food is there, but it's still occupied by snake body, so not eatable yet.\n\nSimilarly, for other moves.\n\nBack to turn 54.\n\nI have three choices: U to (4,5), L to (3,4), or R to (5,4).\n\nI need to think which one is better for long-term.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,6) is tempting, but let's see the risks.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5) on turn 54, then on turn 55 I can go U to (4,6) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n\nBut when I eat at (4,6), on turn 55, after moving to (4,6), it eats, so new head at (4,6), and the tail doesn't move, so snake grows, new positions include the old tail position.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5), or D to (4,4), but D might be possible if not reverse, but from (4,5), if I came from (4,4), so direction would be U, so D would be reverse? When at (4,5), the head direction depends on how I got there.\n\nIf I moved from (4,4) to (4,5) on turn 54, then at turn 55, head is at (4,5), and I just moved up, so direction is U. So I cannot move down to (4,4) because that's opposite.\n\nSimilarly, I can move U, L, or R.\n\n(4,6) is up, which has food.\n\n(3,5) left, (5,5) right.\n\n(4,6) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut is it safe to go to (4,6)?\n\n(4,6) is not wall, not obstacle. Is it occupied? After moving to (4,5) on turn 54, the snake positions at turn 55 before move: head at (4,5), body at (4,4), (4,3), etc. as above. (4,6) is not in the body positions, so free. So moving to (4,6) on turn 55 should be safe, and I eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows, so new length 17.\n\nBut after that, where am I? Head at (4,6), which is near the top border, y=6, and walls at y=7, so I have to be careful not to go up to (4,7) which is wall.\n\ny=7 is wall, so from (4,6), I cannot go up to (4,7).\n\nAlso, the body is below.\n\nNow, another thing: the tail is at (2,4) after turn 54 move, but after eating on turn 55, it changes.\n\nBut let's think if there are risks.\n\nPerhaps I should consider other options.\n\nFor example, if I don't go for (4,6), I could go left or right to explore or go for other food.\n\nBut (4,6) is close and time-sensitive.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) food is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nHow to free (2,2)? The segment at (2,2) will move when the snake moves, but it depends on the path.\n\nCurrently, P6 is at (2,2) with food.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no eat, the tail moves away, but the body segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I move, P6 will move to the position of P5 or something.\n\nIn the move to (4,5) on turn 54, new seg6 is at (3,2) (old P5), new seg7 at (2,2) (old P6), so (2,2) is still occupied by new seg7.\n\nOld P6 is now new seg7 at (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I keep moving, it might take time for that segment to move away.\n\nThe food at (2,2) has life span 5, so it will be there until turn 58, so I have time.\n\n(6,5) has life span 8, even more time.\n\nSo (4,6) is urgent, only 3 turns left.\n\nI should prioritize eating (4,6).\n\nSo on turn 54, move U to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 55, move U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nAfter that, head at (4,6), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nNow, from (4,6), possible moves: since direction U, I can go U, but y=7 is wall, so (4,7) is invalid. Cannot go U.\n\nCan go L to (3,6), R to (5,6), or D to (4,5). But D is opposite to current direction U, so cannot go D? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so I cannot move D to (4,5) because it's opposite.\n\nSo only possible: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nNow, (3,6): not wall, not obstacle. Is it occupied? At turn 55 after eating, let's see positions.\n\nAt turn 54: after move to (4,5), positions as above: head (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nThen on turn 55, move to (4,6) and eat food, so since I eat, the tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,6)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,5)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,4)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (4,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (5,3)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (5,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (3,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (2,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (1,2)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (1,3)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (1,4)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (1,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (1,6)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (2,6)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (2,5)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (2,4)  // and since eaten, no tail move, so new seg17: old tail position? When eating, the new segment is added at the tail, but the tail doesn't advance, so the last position is kept.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake grows.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving head to food cell, the body moves as usual, but the tail doesn't shorten; it stays, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added there? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet's clarify the growth.\n\nTypically in snake: when head moves to a food cell, it eats, so the head is on the food, and then the body moves, but the tail does not move; it stays in place, so the snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n\nFor example, before move: head at A, tail at Z.\n\nAfter move without eat: head to B, tail moves to Y, Z vacated.\n\nAfter move with eat: head to food at B, then body shifts, so new head at B, new seg1 at A, ..., new tail at Z, and since eaten, the tail doesn't move, so Z is still part of snake, and we add a new segment at Z? No.\n\nBetter to think: the snake has positions list. When moving without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, so the last position is removed.\n\nWith eating, head moves to new position (food), each body segment moves to previous position, but the last position is not removed; instead, it stays, so the tail remains, and we add an extra segment at the tail, meaning the snake length increases by one.\n\nIn positions: suppose positions before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eat: [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where Bk is the new tail, and T is gone.\n\nAfter move with eat: [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so the tail T stays, and since newH is added, the list has one more element, with T still there.\n\nFor example, in our case at turn 55:\n\nBefore turn 55 move, positions at turn 54 end: head at (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)  // 16 segments, tail at (2,4)\n\nNow, move head to (4,6) and eat food.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,6)\n\nThen new seg1: old head (4,5)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,4)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (4,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (5,3)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (5,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (3,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (2,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (1,2)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (1,3)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (1,4)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (1,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (1,6)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (2,6)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (2,5)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (2,4)  // and since eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, but the tail was at (2,4), and we keep it, so new seg17: (2,4)? No.\n\nWhen eating, the tail does not move, so the last position is retained, and we add an extra segment at that position? I think I have it.\n\nStandard: after eating, the head moves to the food, the body follows as usual, but the tail remains, so the snake has one more segment. The new tail is the old tail, and it doesn't advance.\n\nIn the list: the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_seg1, ..., old_tail] so the old_tail is still there, and since we added new_head, the length increases.\n\nFor example: old positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]  length N\n\nAfter move with eat to new_head: [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  length N+1\n\nThe tail is still T.\n\nIn this case, at turn 55 after eating at (4,6):\n\nNew positions: head (4,6), then (4,5) old head, (4,4) old seg1, (4,3) old seg2, (5,3) old seg3, (5,2) old seg4, (4,2) old seg5, (3,2) old seg6, (2,2) old seg7, (1,2) old seg8, (1,3) old seg9, (1,4) old seg10, (1,5) old seg11, (1,6) old seg12, (2,6) old seg13, (2,5) old seg14, (2,4) old seg15  // and since eaten, we keep the old tail, so new seg16 is old seg15 (2,4), and new seg17 is the old tail position? No.\n\nOld positions at turn 54 end: indices 0 to 15: P0=(4,5), P1=(4,4), P2=(4,3), P3=(5,3), P4=(5,2), P5=(4,2), P6=(3,2), P7=(2,2), P8=(1,2), P9=(1,3), P10=(1,4), P11=(1,5), P12=(1,6), P13=(2,6), P14=(2,5), P15=(2,4)\n\nAfter move with eat to (4,6): new head at (4,6)\n\nThen new body: the first body segment is old head P0 (4,5)\n\nThen new seg2 is old P1 (4,4)\n\nNew seg3 is old P2 (4,3)\n\nNew seg4 is old P3 (5,3)\n\nNew seg5 is old P4 (5,2)\n\nNew seg6 is old P5 (4,2)\n\nNew seg7 is old P6 (3,2)\n\nNew seg8 is old P7 (2,2)\n\nNew seg9 is old P8 (1,2)\n\nNew seg10 is old P9 (1,3)\n\nNew seg11 is old P10 (1,4)\n\nNew seg12 is old P11 (1,5)\n\nNew seg13 is old P12 (1,6)\n\nNew seg14 is old P13 (2,6)\n\nNew seg15 is old P14 (2,5)\n\nNew seg16 is old P15 (2,4)  // and since eaten, the tail is not removed, so we have 17 segments: new head and all old segments, with the last one being the old tail.\n\nSo new tail is at (2,4)\n\nAnd the food at (2,2) is now at new seg8 position, still occupied.\n\nBack to head at (4,6) after turn 55.\n\nDirection is U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6), since U to (4,7) is wall, D to (4,5) is opposite and also occupied by body.\n\n(4,5) is now body segment, so moving to (4,5) would be body collision.\n\nBut anyway, cannot move D due to reverse rule.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, (3,6): x=3,y=6, not wall, not obstacle. Is it occupied? Current positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), (4,4), etc. (3,6) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) not occupied.\n\nSo both possible.\n\nI need to choose which way to go for long-term survival.\n\nThere is food at (6,5), which is at (6,5), value 1.\n\nAlso, the area on the right might be more open.\n\nLeft side has the body coiled.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), I can go down or left, but let's see the grid.\n\nGrid: walls at borders, obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake body occupies left and bottom area.\n\nAfter being at (4,6), if I go L to (3,6), then from there, possible moves: U not, y=7 wall; D to (3,5); L to (2,6); R to (4,6) but occupied.\n\nDirection: if I move L to (3,6), then direction is L.\n\nThen from (3,6), can go L to (2,6), D to (3,5), or U not, R to (4,6) occupied or reverse.\n\n(2,6) is a body segment? Current positions after turn 55: (2,6) is new seg14, which is body, so (2,6) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): let's see if occupied.\n\nPositions: y=5 has (1,5), (2,5), (4,5)? (4,5) is seg1, (2,5) is seg15? After turn 55 eat: positions: head (4,6), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (5,2), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (3,2), seg8 (2,2), seg9 (1,2), seg10 (1,3), seg11 (1,4), seg12 (1,5), seg13 (1,6), seg14 (2,6), seg15 (2,5), seg16 (2,4)\n\nSo (3,5) not in list, free.\n\n(2,6) is seg14, occupied.\n\nSo from (3,6), after moving there, I can go L to (2,6) but occupied, not possible; D to (3,5); or R to (4,6) occupied; U not possible. Only D to (3,5) is possible? L to (2,6) is occupied, so only D to (3,5) is valid move from (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 55, then at turn 56, from (3,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,6) but (2,6) is occupied by seg14, so collision; R to (4,6) occupied by head previous position or something? At turn 56, before move, head at (3,6), positions include (4,6) as previous head, but (4,6) is body now, occupied.\n\nSpecifically, (2,6) and (4,6) are both occupied, U not possible, so only possible move is D to (3,5).\n\nThen to (3,5).\n\nFrom there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut it might be restrictive.\n\nIf from (4,6) I go R to (5,6) on turn 55.\n\nThen at (5,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U not, D to (5,5), L to (4,6) occupied, R to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is not wall? x=6,y=6, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is not border, y=6 not border, so (6,6) is free? But walls at x=0,x=7, so x=6 is within, y=6 within.\n\nIs (6,6) occupied? Not in positions, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) not occupied.\n\nSo from (5,6), I can go R to (6,6) or D to (5,5).\n\nIf I go to (6,6), then from there, only down or left, but (5,6) occupied.\n\n(6,6) is corner, might be risky.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can go D to (5,5), then to (6,5) or other.\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (3,1), but not relevant here.\n\nNow, back to turn 54 decision.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5) on turn 54, then U to (4,6) on turn 55 to eat, then at turn 55, I have to go either L or R.\n\nGoing L to (3,6) might lead to a dead end as above, only to (3,5).\n\nGoing R to (5,6) might be better, as I can go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is close to (6,5) food.\n\n(6,5) has life span 8, so no rush.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (4,6) at all, if it leads to a bad position.\n\nAnother option at turn 54: instead of U, I could go L or R.\n\nFor example, go L to (3,4) on turn 54.\n\nFrom (4,4), L to (3,4).\n\nThen direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but occupied or reverse.\n\nCurrent direction L, so R would be reverse, cannot.\n\nSo U, D, or L.\n\n(3,5): not occupied, free.\n\n(3,3): let's see, y=3 has positions: after move to (3,4), let's compute positions.\n\nAt turn 54, after move L to (3,4) with no eat.\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (5,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (5,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (4,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (3,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (2,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (1,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (1,3)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (1,4)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (1,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (1,6)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (2,6)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (2,5)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (2,4)  // tail, old P15 (2,3) vacated.\n\n(3,5) not occupied.\n\n(3,3) not occupied.\n\n(2,4) is occupied by new seg15.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3), or L to (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, so only U or D.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (5,4) on turn 54.\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nNew seg1: (4,4)\n\nNew seg2: (4,3)\n\nNew seg3: (5,3)\n\n etc, similar to above.\n\n(5,5) or (5,3) etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is body, so from (5,4), can go U to (5,5), D to (5,3) occupied or reverse, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4).\n\nSo only U or R.\n\n(6,4) is free.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to consider the food at (2,2) that is under body.\n\nHow can I free it?\n\nThe segment at (2,2) will move when the snake moves, but it depends on the movement pattern.\n\nCurrently, at turn 54, P6 is at (2,2) with food.\n\nAfter moves, it shifts.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the body moves away from (2,2), but it will take several turns.\n\nSince the food has life span 5, I can plan to free it later.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the body is coiled, so I need to uncoil or something.\n\nThe tail is at (2,3), and if I can move the tail away, but the tail moves when the head moves.\n\nPerhaps I should aim to go towards the area where the food is to free it.\n\nBut (2,2) is occupied, so I need to have the head not near when it frees, or something.\n\nRule: to eat, the body must move away, then head moves there.\n\nSo when the snake moves, if the segment that was at (2,2) moves to a new position, then (2,2) is vacated, and food is there, so it can be eaten if head moves to it.\n\nBut at that point, the cell is free, so head can move to it.\n\nFor example, currently at turn 54, (2,2) occupied.\n\nAfter a move, if no eat, the position might be vacated or not.\n\nIn the move to (4,5) on turn 54, new seg7 at (2,2), so still occupied.\n\nIf I move again, say to (4,6) on turn 55 with eat, then new seg8 at (2,2), still occupied.\n\nTo free (2,2), I need a move where the segment that was at (2,2) moves to a different position, and no new segment is added there.\n\nFor instance, when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away.\n\nBut the segment at (2,2) is not the tail; tail is at (2,3) or something.\n\nLet's find when the segment at (2,2) will move.\n\nThe position (2,2) is occupied by P6 at turn 54.\n\nWhen the snake moves, P6 will become the position of P5 at the previous turn.\n\nIn general, the body segments follow the path.\n\nTo have (2,2) vacated, the segment that was there must move, and not be replaced.\n\nSince the snake is moving, each move, the body segments shift, so the cell (2,2) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves to a new position, and no other segment moves to it immediately.\n\nBut in the shifting, it might be occupied by the next segment, but not necessarily.\n\nFor example, in the list, when head moves, each body segment takes the position of the previous segment, so the cell that was occupied by a body segment may be vacated if it's the tail, or occupied by the next segment.\n\nSpecifically, for a cell, it is vacated only when the segment that was there is the tail and no eat, so tail moves away.\n\nFor non-tail segments, when they move, their old position is taken by the segment behind them, so it doesn't vacate immediately.\n\nOnly the tail position is vacated when no eat.\n\nFor (2,2), it is occupied by P6, which is not tail, so when P6 moves to a new position, its old position (2,2) will be taken by P7, which moves to (2,2) in the new positions.\n\nSimilarly, only when the tail is at (2,2) and it moves, then (2,2) is vacated.\n\nCurrently at turn 54, tail is at (2,3), not (2,2).\n\nP6 is at (2,2), P7 at (1,2), etc., tail P15 at (2,3).\n\nSo to have the tail at (2,2), I need to move in a way that the tail comes to (2,2).\n\nBut the tail moves only when the head moves without eating.\n\nEach time head moves without eating, the tail advances to the next position in the path.\n\nThe tail is at (2,3), and it was at (1,4) or something, let's see the path.\n\nThe snake has been moving, but from the positions, the tail is at (2,3), and before that it was at (2,4) at some point, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps for now, since (2,2) food has life span 5, I can ignore it for a few turns and focus on other food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is available.\n\nBut (4,6) is urgent.\n\nAnother risk: if I go to (4,6), I am near the top, and with the body below, I might get trapped.\n\nBut let's think about the grid size.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders.\n\nAfter eating at (4,6), head at (4,6), and I have to go left or right.\n\nIf I go right to (5,6), then I can go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nFrom (5,6) to (5,5), then to (5,4) or (6,5) etc.\n\n(6,5) is food, so I can eat it later.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (6,5) to eat.\n\nLife span 8, so ok.\n\nBut let's see if I can plan 5 turns.\n\nTurn 54: at (4,4), direction U.\n\nOption 1: U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55: U to (4,6) eat food.\n\nThen turn 55: at (4,6), must go L or R.\n\nSay go R to (5,6)  (I choose R for now)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 56: from (5,6), direction R, can go R to (6,6) or D to (5,5).\n\n(6,6) is free, but then from (6,6), I can go D to (6,5) or L to (5,6) occupied.\n\n(6,5) has food, so I can go D to (6,5) to eat on turn 57? Let's see.\n\nIf on turn 56, from (5,6) I go D to (5,5).\n\nThen at (5,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 57: from (5,5), can go D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5), U to (5,6) but occupied or reverse.\n\nDirection D, so U would be reverse, cannot.\n\nSo D, L, or R.\n\n(5,4) : let's see if occupied later.\n\n(4,5): at turn 57, it might be occupied.\n\n(6,5) has food.\n\nSo I can go R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen after eating, head at (6,5), and so on.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nBut in this case, no food at tail, so ok.\n\nBut let's check the positions as I go.\n\nFirst, for turn 54, I think U to (4,5) is good to get the food.\n\nThen for turn 55, U to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen for turn 55, I need to choose L or R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,6), then on turn 56, I can go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nIf I go to (5,5), then on turn 57 to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter eating at (4,6), positions as above.\n\nThen move to (5,6) on turn 55: new head (5,6), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (4,2), seg8 (3,2), seg9 (2,2), seg10 (1,2), seg11 (1,3), seg12 (1,4), seg13 (1,5), seg14 (1,6), seg15 (2,6), seg16 (2,5), seg17 (2,4)  // 17 segments after growth.\n\nThen turn 56, from (5,6), move to say (5,5) with no eat.\n\nNew head (5,5), new seg1 (5,6), new seg2 (4,6), new seg3 (4,5), etc., and tail moves, so new tail is old seg16 (2,5)? Old positions: head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), ..., seg17 (2,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no eat: new head (5,5), new seg1 (5,6), new seg2 (4,6), new seg3 (4,5), new seg4 (4,4), new seg5 (4,3), new seg6 (5,3), new seg7 (5,2), new seg8 (4,2), new seg9 (3,2), new seg10 (2,2), new seg11 (1,2), new seg12 (1,3), new seg13 (1,4), new seg14 (1,5), new seg15 (1,6), new seg16 (2,6), new seg17 (2,5)  // new tail (2,5), old (2,4) vacated.\n\n(2,2) is now at new seg10, still occupied with food.\n\nThen on turn 57, from (5,5), move to (6,5) to eat food.\n\nNew head (6,5), and grow, so positions include old tail, etc.\n\nBut (6,5) is food, so eat.\n\nThen head at (6,5), near right wall.\n\nx=6, wall at x=7, so can go left or down.\n\nBut body around.\n\nThe point is, by going for (4,6) and then (6,5), I can eat two foods.\n\nBut I have to avoid trapping myself.\n\nThe food at (2,2) might be freed later.\n\nLife span 5, so at turn 58 it disappears.\n\nTurn 54,55,56,57,58.\n\nAt turn 54, life span 5, so available turn 54,55,56,57,58.\n\nOn turn 58, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nTo eat (2,2), I need the cell free and head there.\n\nCurrently occupied, so I need to free it.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) is P6 at turn 54.\n\nAs the snake moves, this segment will move to different positions.\n\nFor example, if I move in a certain way, the position (2,2) might be vacated when the tail is there and moves.\n\nBut tail is at (2,3), so if I move, tail moves to (2,4) or something.\n\nAt turn 54, tail at (2,3).\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat, new tail at (2,4), as earlier.\n\n(2,2) still occupied.\n\nThen after eat at (4,6), tail at (2,4).\n\nThen after move to (5,6), tail at (2,5) or something.\n\nIt might take time.\n\nSince the snake is long, freeing (2,2) might not be easy, and it might not be worth it for one food, especially if it risks the snake.\n\nBut let's see the map.\n\nThe body is coiled in the left-bottom corner, so moving away might free it eventually.\n\nFor example, if I go to the right, the tail might follow and free up space.\n\nBut for now, at turn 54, I think going U to (4,5) is the best to get the urgent food.\n\nThen on turn 55, I should go R to (5,6) to have more space, rather than L which might be tight.\n\nThen I can go for (6,5) later.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output moves for multiple turns.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but the answer should be a sequence of actions for the next few turns, starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=54.\n\nSo I need to output actions for turn 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, etc.\n\nBut I have to decide based on the state.\n\nSince the future depends on food and positions, I need to simulate.\n\nBut food life span decreases, so I need to consider.\n\nAlso, after moves, the state changes.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a sequence.\n\nLet me try to plan.\n\nTurn 54: from (4,4) direction U, move U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55: from (4,5) direction U, move U to (4,6) eat food at (4,6)\n\nNow at (4,6) direction U, but can only go L or R. I choose R to (5,6) for more space.\n\nMove R to (5,6), direction R.\n\nTurn 56: from (5,6) direction R, possible moves: R to (6,6) or D to (5,5)\n\n(6,6) is available, but then from there, I can go D to (6,5) to eat the food there, or L to (5,6) occupied.\n\n(6,5) has food, so I can go directly to (6,5) from (5,6)? Not directly, (5,6) to (6,5) is diagonal, not adjacent; only up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,5), I need to go to (5,5) or (6,6) first.\n\nSay I go D to (5,5) on turn 56.\n\nThen at (5,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 57: from (5,5), can go D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) has food, so move R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction R (since moved right).\n\nNow turn 58: from (6,5), direction R, can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so cannot R.\n\nL to (5,5) might be occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5) on turn 57, positions: let's not compute all, but (5,5) was previous head, so occupied.\n\nU to (6,6), D to (6,4), or L to (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo U or D.\n\n(6,6) might be free or not.\n\nAt turn 57 before move, after turn 56 move to (5,5) no eat.\n\nPositions at turn 56 end: after move to (5,5), head at (5,5), body: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc., and tail at (2,5) or something.\n\nThen on turn 57, move to (6,5) and eat, so new head (6,5), grow, positions include (5,5) as body, etc.\n\nAt turn 58, from (6,5), direction R, so can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5) occupied, R not possible.\n\n(6,6): if not occupied, free.\n\n(6,4) free.\n\nSay go U to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), can go D to (6,5) occupied, L to (5,6) might be occupied, or U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, not possible. Only L or D, but D to (6,5) occupied, so only L to (5,6) if free.\n\nBut (5,6) might be body.\n\nIn this path, after turn 57, head at (6,5), body around, (5,6) and (6,6) might be free or not, but it could get tight.\n\nTo avoid, on turn 56 from (5,6), instead of going to (5,5), I could go to (6,6).\n\nThen at (6,6), direction R.\n\nTurn 57: from (6,6), can go D to (6,5) to eat food, or L to (5,6) occupied.\n\nSo go D to (6,5) eat.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 58: from (6,5), direction D, can go D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R not, U to (6,6) occupied.\n\n(6,4) and (5,5) possible.\n\n(5,5) might be free.\n\nThen I can move to (5,5) or (6,4).\n\nBetter than previous.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 54: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: U to (4,6) eat\n\nTurn 55: R to (5,6)  // on turn 55 after eating, move to (5,6)\n\nIn the sequence, turn 55 action is after the state, but in the answer, it's the action for that turn.\n\nFor turn 55, from the state at turn 55, but the state changes after each action.\n\nIn the answer format, it's \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action\", so for each turn, the action based on the state at that turn.\n\nBut since I'm planning, I need to specify the actions.\n\nFor turn 55, after moving to (4,5) on turn 54, at turn 55 start, head at (4,5), direction U, so action U to (4,6).\n\nThen after that, at turn 56 start, head at (4,6), direction U, but then I move to (5,6), so action R.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U to (4,6) eat\n\nThen at turn 55, after eating, head at (4,6), direction U, but for turn 56 action, from (4,6), I move to (5,6), so action R.\n\nThe turns: turn 54 action: move from (4,4) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55 action: move from (4,5) to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 56 action: move from (4,6) to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 57 action: from (5,6) to (6,6) or to (5,5)\n\nIn my earlier, I said on turn 56 from (5,6) to (6,6)\n\nTurn 56 action is from head position at turn 56 start.\n\nAfter turn 55 action, at turn 56 start, head at (4,6)? No.\n\nTurn 54 action: move to (4,5), so at turn 55 start, head at (4,5)\n\nTurn 55 action: move to (4,6), so at turn 56 start, head at (4,6)\n\nThen turn 56 action: from (4,6), I move to (5,6), so action R\n\nThen at turn 57 start, head at (5,6), direction R (since moved right)\n\nThen turn 57 action: from (5,6), I can move to (6,6) or (5,5)\n\nSay move to (6,6), action R\n\nThen at turn 58 start, head at (6,6), direction R\n\nThen turn 58 action: from (6,6), move to (6,5) to eat, action D\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut on turn 57, from (5,6) to (6,6), then on turn 58 to (6,5) eat.\n\n(6,5) food life span 8, at turn 54, so on turn 58 it's still there, life span decreases to 4 on turn 58? Life span at turn 54: 8, turn 55:7, turn 56:6, turn 57:5, turn 58:4, so yes.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,2), with this path, it might not be eaten, but I can try later if possible.\n\nBut in this sequence, I eat two foods.\n\nNow, is there a better initial move?\n\nSuppose at turn 54, I go L to (3,4) instead.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), etc., but (4,6) food might expire before I can reach it.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (4,6) is not direct, need multiple turns, by turn 56 it might be gone.\n\nFor example, turn 54 L to (3,4), then turn 55 U to (3,5), then turn 56 U to (3,6), then to (4,6) but on turn 56, life span of (4,6) is 1, since turn 54:3, turn 55:2, turn 56:1, so on turn 56 I can eat if I reach, but from (3,6) to (4,6) is adjacent, so on turn 57? Turn 56 action from (3,6) to (4,6), but at turn 56 start, if head at (3,6), I can move to (4,6) if free.\n\nBut let's see: after turn 54 L to (3,4), at turn 55 start head (3,4), move U to (3,5), at turn 56 start head (3,5), move U to (3,6), at turn 57 start head (3,6), then move R to (4,6) to eat, but on turn 57, life span of (4,6) was 3 at turn 54, turn 55:2, turn 56:1, turn 57:0, so it disappears before turn 57? Life span decreases every turn including current, but when does it disappear?\n\nCore rules: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAt turn t, with life span L, it is present.\n\nAfter turn t, life span becomes L-1.\n\nIf L-1 >0, still present; if L-1=0, disappears after turn t.\n\nSo for (4,6) at turn 54: L=3, present.\n\nTurn 55: L=2, present.\n\nTurn 56: L=1, present.\n\nTurn 57: L=0, not present, disappeared.\n\nSo on turn 56, it is still present with L=1, so can be eaten on turn 56.\n\nBut on turn 57, gone.\n\nIn the sequence, if on turn 56, I am at (3,6), I can move to (4,6) on turn 56 to eat.\n\nBut from above: after turn 55 move to (3,5), at turn 56 start head (3,5), I move to (3,6) or directly to (4,6)? (3,5) to (4,6) not adjacent, only to (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(4,5) might be occupied.\n\nIn the state after turn 55, if I went to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), etc., (4,5) is not necessarily occupied, but let's not compute.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (4,5) if free, then on turn 57 to (4,6), but on turn 57 it's gone.\n\nOnly on turn 56 I can eat (4,6) from (3,6) or (4,5) or (5,6), but from (3,5), to reach (4,6) on turn 56, I need to be at adjacent cell on turn 56 start.\n\nAt turn 56 start, if I am at (4,5) or (3,6) or (5,6), I can move to (4,6).\n\nBut in the path from (3,4) on turn 55, if I go to (4,5) on turn 55, but on turn 55 from (3,4), I can go to (4,5) if possible.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction L, I can go to (4,5)? (4,5) is not adjacent to (3,4); adjacent cells are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is body, so cannot.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to (4,5) from (3,4).\n\nI have to go to (3,5) or (3,3) or (2,4).\n\nThen to (4,6) on turn 56 only if I am at (4,5) or (3,6) or (5,6) on turn 56 start.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) turn 54, go U to (3,5) turn 55, then at turn 56 start at (3,5), move to (3,6), then on turn 57 to (4,6) but too late.\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 56 start, I can move to (4,5) if free, then to (4,6) on turn 56? From (3,5) to (4,5) is possible if (4,5) free.\n\nIn the positions after turn 55, if head at (3,5), body includes (3,4), (4,4), etc., (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nAssuming it is free, then move to (4,5) on turn 56, but then from (4,5), I can move to (4,6) on turn 56? Turn 56 action: from (3,5) to (4,5), then at turn 57, from (4,5) to (4,6), but on turn 57 (4,6) gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 56, I need to move directly to (4,6) on turn 56 action, so I need to be at (4,5), (3,6), (5,6), or (4,7) but wall, at turn 56 start.\n\nIf at turn 56 start I am at (4,5), I can move to (4,6).\n\nBut to be at (4,5) on turn 56 start, I need to have moved there on turn 55.\n\nOn turn 55, from where? At turn 55 start, if I was at (4,4), I could go to (4,5), but if I went left on turn 54, I am at (3,4) on turn 55 start.\n\nFrom (3,4), I cannot go to (4,5) directly.\n\nThe only way to be at (4,5) on turn 56 start is if I go to (4,5) on turn 55 action from (4,4) on turn 55 start.\n\nBut if on turn 54 I went left, I am not at (4,4) on turn 55 start.\n\nTherefore, if I don't go up on turn 54, I cannot reach (4,6) in time to eat it before it disappears.\n\nThus, going U on turn 54 is necessary to eat (4,6).\n\nTherefore, I should go U on turn 54.\n\nThen the sequence as before.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output turns 54 to 58 or so.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 55, after going to (4,5), I go U to (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 56, from (4,6) to (5,6), action R.\n\nThen on turn 57, from (5,6) to (6,6), action R.\n\nThen on turn 58, from (6,6) to (6,5), action D to eat.\n\nBut on turn 58, (6,5) is still there.\n\nLife span 8 at turn 54: turn 55:7, 56:6, 57:5, 58:4, so yes.\n\nNow, for turn 59, etc., but I think for the answer, 5 turns might be enough, from 54 to 58.\n\nt1=54, so turns 54,55,56,57,58.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: R\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nBut on turn 58, I go to (6,5) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 57: from (5,6) to (6,6), then turn 58: from (6,6) to (6,5).\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it clearer.\n\nPerhaps I should include the food at (2,2), but it might not be feasible soon.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not in the way.\n\nSo I think this is ok.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 54 to 58, thinking 5 turns ahead. The plan prioritizes eating the time-sensitive positive food at (4,6) (life span 3, expiring after turn 56) and then the food at (6,5) (life span 8, less urgent). Moving towards (4,6) on turn 54 is critical to avoid missing it. After eating (4,6), the snake moves right to (5,6) to access more open space and avoid the coiled body on the left, reducing collision risk. Then, it moves to (6,6) to position for eating (6,5) on turn 58. The food at (2,2) is under the body and has a longer life span (5 turns), so it is not prioritized immediately to avoid unnecessary risk in the congested area.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food at (4,6)**: Must be eaten by turn 56. Moving up on turns 54 and 55 secures this +1 score and grows the snake.\n- **Food at (6,5)**: Eaten on turn 58 for another +1 score. The path via (5,6) and (6,6) is safe and efficient.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: \n  - The left side (e.g., moving to (3,6)) is riskier due to the snake's body, potentially leading to dead ends. Moving right provides more space.\n  - Wall and collision checks are performed for each move. For example, from (4,6), moving up is impossible (y=7 wall), and down is invalid (reverse move), leaving only left or right; right is chosen for better long-term options.\n  - Tail reward danger is not a concern here, as no food is adjacent to the tail.\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverse moves are made (e.g., after moving up, down is not allowed next).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 58, the snake can explore the bottom-right area (e.g., (6,4) or (5,5)) to avoid walls and seek more food, but the sequence focuses on the critical 5 turns.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence:\n- **Turn 54**: Move U (up) to (4,5). This positions the head closer to (4,6) and avoids missing the food. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 55**: Move U (up) to (4,6). This eats the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to 17 segments). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 56**: Move R (right) to (5,6). This avoids the left-side body cluster and heads towards (6,5). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 57**: Move R (right) to (6,6). This further positions for (6,5) and stays clear of walls. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 58**: Move D (down) to (6,5). This eats the positive food at (6,5) (+1 score, snake grows to 18 segments). Direction becomes D.\n\nThis sequence earns +2 score from food and positions the snake in a safer area with options for future moves (e.g., to (6,4) or (5,5) on turn 59).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: R \\\\\nTurn 57: R \\\\\nTurn 58: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 55. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,1) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,5), and direction is Up. The body segments are listed: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,6) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 4, value +1\n\n- (6,5) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (2,4) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including this one, so after turn 55, life span of (4,6) will be 1, then 0, so it disappears after turn 56 if not eaten.\n\nCurrent head direction is Up, so moving Up means increasing y-coordinate. From (4,5), Up would go to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has food! But I need to be careful because of the tail reward danger. What is the tail position? Snake positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), etc. The tail is the last segment, which is (2,4).\n\nIf I move Up to (4,6), I eat the food there. But since it's positive food, snake length increases by one. After eating, the head moves to (4,6), and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since it's growing, the tail doesn't move immediately? No, in Snake, when you eat, the tail stays in place for that turn, so the new segment is added at the tail position, but the snake moves, so the tail position changes.\n\nStandard Snake movement: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves one cell forward if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn this case, if I eat food at (4,6), head moves to (4,6), and since food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is still (2,4)? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn start: snake positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), ..., (2,4)]\n\nIf I move Up to (4,6), which has food. So after move:\n\n- Head moves to (4,6)\n\n- Since food eaten, the body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n\nTypically: when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the tail does not advance; the snake grows. So the new position list: the head is at new position, then the previous head becomes part of body, and all segments shift except the tail stays, so the snake gets longer.\n\nFor example: positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n\nAfter moving and eating:\n\n- New head: (4,6)\n\n- Then the previous positions: (4,5) becomes neck, (4,4) becomes next, and so on, down to tail (2,4) still there, but since no tail advance, the tail remains, so the list has one more segment.\n\nIn terms of positions: new snake: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), ..., (2,4)] with the last segment still (2,4), so length increased by one.\n\nBut (2,4) is the tail, and it has food? (2,4) has food according to the list: (2,4) with life span 10, value 1.\n\nIn the food positions, (2,4) is listed, so there is food at (2,4).\n\nBut (2,4) is currently occupied by the tail segment. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nHere, (2,4) is the tail, and if I eat at (4,6), the tail doesn't move, so (2,4) remains occupied by the tail, so the food there can't be eaten yet because the snake is still on it.\n\nMoreover, after this move, the head is at (4,6), and the tail is at (2,4).\n\nNow, about tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (4,6), head at (4,6), tail at (2,4). Are they adjacent? (4,6) and (2,4): difference in x is 2, y is 2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So (4,6) to (2,4) is not adjacent; it's two steps away. So no immediate danger.\n\nBut the food at (2,4) is under the tail, so to eat it, the tail needs to move away first.\n\nNow, back to moving to (4,6). (4,6) is within bounds? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is x=4, y=6, which is within 1 to 6? y=6, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable, since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so cells y=1 to y=6 are ok? Let's see the walls.\n\nCells occupied by walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also internal (3,1).\n\nSo for (4,6): x=4 between 1 and 6, y=6, y=6 is not y=0 or y=7, so it's valid, no wall.\n\nNow, is there a body segment at (4,6)? Snake positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), etc. (4,6) is not in the list, so empty, except for food.\n\nSimilarly, food is there, so moving to (4,6) is possible and eats the food.\n\nBut life span of (4,6) is 2 at turn 55. After this turn, it decreases to 1, but since I eat it now, it's consumed.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, but if I eat it this turn, it should be fine.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 55, life span 2, after turn 55, it becomes 1, and after turn 56, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nBut if I move to it on turn 55, I eat it before it disappears, so it should be eaten.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, other options: I could move in other directions.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,5), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: Up to (4,6), Down to (4,4), but (4,4) is the first body segment, so collision if I go down. Down would be (4,4), which is part of the body, so I die if I go there.\n\nLeft: (3,5), is that free? Snake positions: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), etc. (3,5) not listed, so probably free. But walls: internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,5) is not that, and borders ok. So (3,5) should be free.\n\nRight: (5,5), not in snake positions, walls ok, so free.\n\nDown is blocked by body.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: since current direction is Up, I cannot move Down next turn, but Down is already blocked by body anyway.\n\nSo possible actions: Up, Left, or Right.\n\nNow, Up leads to eating food at (4,6).\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list all food:\n\n- (4,6): life span 2, so after turn 55, if not eaten, life span 1, then after turn 56, gone.\n\n- (2,2): life span 4, so will disappear after turn 58? Turn 55: life span 4, after turn 55: 3, turn 56: 2, turn 57: 1, turn 58: 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): life span 7, disappear after turn 61.\n\n(2,4): life span 10, disappear after turn 64.\n\nBut (2,4) is currently under the tail, so to eat it, the tail must move away first.\n\nNow, snake length is 16, as per positions list.\n\nIf I eat (4,6), length becomes 17.\n\nBut let's consider the grid.\n\nI should sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but walls at borders and (3,1) blocked.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 playable? y=1 to 6 inclusive? For example, (1,1) to (6,6), but (3,1) is blocked, so not all cells.\n\nList all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is an internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,5)\n\nThen: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) tail.\n\nSo the snake body covers many cells.\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (4,6) - free, I think? Not occupied by snake, yes.\n\n- (2,2) - but (2,2) is a body segment? Snake positions: (2,2) is the 8th segment? List: index 0: (4,5), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), yes, (2,2) is occupied by the snake, so food is under the body.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is the tail, food under it.\n\n(6,5) is free? Not in snake positions, so yes.\n\n(2,4) is tail, so food under tail.\n\nNow, to eat food under body, the body must move away first.\n\nFor (2,2), it's a body segment, not tail, so when the snake moves, if that segment moves, it might expose the food.\n\nSimilarly for (2,4), tail.\n\nBack to turn 55 decision.\n\nOptions: U, L, or R.\n\nU: to (4,6), eat food. Then snake grows to 17 segments.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) tail. Since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so (2,4) still there, and length 17.\n\nBut (2,4) has food under it, but since snake is on it, not eaten.\n\nNow, life span of (4,6) is consumed.\n\nOther food still there.\n\nThen for next turn, head at (4,6), direction was U, but after move, direction is U? The head direction will be updated based on move.\n\nThe state gives current head direction, which is U, but after I move, the new direction depends on what I do.\n\nFor the next move, I need to consider possible actions from there.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nL: Left to (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is free? Snake positions: no (3,5), walls: (3,1) blocked but (3,5) is different, so free.\n\nR: Right to (5,5), similarly free.\n\nNow, if I go Left to (3,5), no food there, so snake moves, tail advances.\n\nCurrent tail is (2,4). When no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves forward, so the segment at tail position is removed.\n\nSo from positions: move head to (3,5), then body: (4,5) becomes segment, (4,4), ..., up to the second last, and tail (2,4) is removed, new tail is the previous one, which is (2,5)? Positions: after move, head (3,5), then previous head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), ..., down to (2,5), and (2,4) is left, so tail is (2,5)? Let's see the list.\n\nCurrent positions: indices: 0:(4,5), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(5,3), 4:(5,2), 5:(4,2), 6:(3,2), 7:(2,2), 8:(1,2), 9:(1,3), 10:(1,4), 11:(1,5), 12:(1,6), 13:(2,6), 14:(2,5), 15:(2,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving left to (3,5), no food eaten, so:\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nThen the body: positions 0 to 14 become the new body segments, but since tail advances, we remove the last one.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,5), then seg1: (4,5), seg2: (4,4), seg3: (4,3), seg4: (5,3), seg5: (5,2), seg6: (4,2), seg7: (3,2), seg8: (2,2), seg9: (1,2), seg10: (1,3), seg11: (1,4), seg12: (1,5), seg13: (1,6), seg14: (2,6), and new tail is (2,5) which was seg14, but seg14 was (2,6)? Positions: after head move, the list is [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) ] and (2,5) is removed, so tail is (2,6)? Let's count.\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nThen the first body segment is the old head (4,5)\n\nThen (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), and then (2,5) was the 15th, but since no growth, we don't include it, so the last body segment is (2,6), which was position 13, but in new list, it's the 14th segment? Better to think: the snake had 16 segments, after move with no eat, it has 16 segments, head moved, tail removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) ] and that's 15 positions? No:\n\nOld list had 16 positions: indices 0 to 15.\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,5), then old positions 0 to 14 become the body segments, but since tail advances, we take positions 0 to 14 for the body, but position 0 is the old head, which is now the neck, position 1 to 14 are the rest, and position 15 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new snake: head (3,5), then body: old pos0: (4,5), old pos1: (4,4), ..., up to old pos14: (2,5)? Old pos14 is (2,5), and old pos15 is (2,4) removed.\n\nOld positions: 0:(4,5), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(5,3), 4:(5,2), 5:(4,2), 6:(3,2), 7:(2,2), 8:(1,2), 9:(1,3), 10:(1,4), 11:(1,5), 12:(1,6), 13:(2,6), 14:(2,5), 15:(2,4)\n\nAfter move left to (3,5), no eat:\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nNew body: the first segment is old head (4,5) which is old pos0\n\nThen old pos1: (4,4)\n\nOld pos2: (4,3)\n\nOld pos3: (5,3)\n\nOld pos4: (5,2)\n\nOld pos5: (4,2)\n\nOld pos6: (3,2)\n\nOld pos7: (2,2)\n\nOld pos8: (1,2)\n\nOld pos9: (1,3)\n\nOld pos10: (1,4)\n\nOld pos11: (1,5)\n\nOld pos12: (1,6)\n\nOld pos13: (2,6)\n\nOld pos14: (2,5)  -- this is now the tail, since old pos15 removed.\n\nSo new tail is (2,5)\n\nAnd the food at (2,4) is now exposed, since tail moved to (2,5), so (2,4) is free with food.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,2), it's still occupied by body, since (2,2) is old pos7, which is now in the body.\n\nIn new positions, (2,2) is the 8th segment or something.\n\nBut food at (2,2) is under it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (5,5), similar thing.\n\nBut let's first consider going up to (4,6) with food.\n\nTurn 55: move U to (4,6), eat food. Life span was 2, consumed.\n\nNew snake: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) tail. Length 17.\n\nHead at (4,6), direction was U, but now head is at (4,6), and I just moved U, so for next move, I can go U, L, R, but not D (down) because that would be reverse, but also, U from (4,6) would be to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\ny=7 is wall, so from (4,6), I cannot go U.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,6), D to (4,5), or R to (5,6).\n\nBut (4,5) is the neck, so if I go down to (4,5), I collide with body, die.\n\nSo cannot go D.\n\nL to (3,6): is that free? (3,6) not in snake positions, walls: x=3,y=6, not wall except borders, but y=6 ok, x=3 ok, not (3,1), so free.\n\nR to (5,6): similarly free.\n\nAlso, food at (6,5) and (2,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) is tail, with food, but head is at (4,6), not adjacent.\n\nNow, life span of (4,6) is gone, others remain.\n\n(2,2) has food under it, life span 4.\n\nAfter this move, at turn 56, head at (4,6), I need to choose move.\n\nIf I go L to (3,6), no food, so snake moves, tail advances from (2,4) to where? Current tail is (2,4), but after move with no eat, tail advances.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,6), body down to tail (2,4)\n\nIf I move to (3,6), no food there, so new head (3,6), then body: (4,6) becomes neck, (4,5), (4,4), ..., up to the second last, and tail (2,4) removed, new tail is (2,5)? Similar to before.\n\nOld positions: 0:(4,6), 1:(4,5), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(5,3), 5:(5,2), 6:(4,2), 7:(3,2), 8:(2,2), 9:(1,2), 10:(1,3), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,5), 13:(1,6), 14:(2,6), 15:(2,5), 16:(2,4) tail? Earlier I had 17 positions after eating.\n\nAfter eating at turn 55, positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ] so 17 segments.\n\nIf move to (3,6) no eat, new head (3,6), then body: old pos0: (4,6), old pos1: (4,5), ..., up to old pos15: (2,5), and old pos16: (2,4) removed, so new tail is (2,5)? Old pos15 is (2,5), which becomes the new tail.\n\nNew positions: [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) ] so tail at (2,5)\n\nFood at (2,4) is now exposed and can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut (2,4) is at (2,4), head at (3,6), not adjacent.\n\nIf from (4,6) I go R to (5,6), similar.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,2). It's under a body segment. In the current state, (2,2) is occupied, so to eat it, that segment must move away.\n\nIn the snake path, (2,2) is a segment that will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment at (2,2) advances, then the cell (2,2) might be free if no new segment is added, but since the snake moves, the position changes.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, each segment moves to the next position, so the cell that was occupied by a segment might be vacated if that segment moves and no new segment is added there.\n\nFor (2,2), it is currently occupied by the 7th segment (in initial state).\n\nAs the snake moves, that segment will move to the next position in the path.\n\nFor example, in initial state, if I move left or right, the segment at (2,2) might move to a different cell.\n\nBut it's complicated to track.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should consider the available space and the food locations.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the left side, from x=1 to 4, with a loop.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), then down to (4,4), (4,3), then right to (5,3), down to (5,2), left to (4,2), left to (3,2), left to (2,2), down? (2,2) to (1,2) south, then (1,3) north? y increases up? In coordinates, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up.\n\nSo from (1,2) to (1,3) U, to (1,4) U, to (1,5) U, to (1,6) U, to (2,6) R? x+1, so east, to (2,5) D? y-1, south, to (2,4) D? south again.\n\nSo the tail is at (2,4).\n\nFood at (2,4) under tail.\n\nFood at (2,2) under body.\n\nFood at (4,6) free.\n\nFood at (6,5) free.\n\n(4,6) is north of head, (6,5) is east of head but not directly.\n\nFrom (4,5), (6,5) is two steps right.\n\nIf I don't go up to (4,6), I could go right to (5,5), then to (6,5) to eat that food.\n\nLife span of (4,6) is short, only 2 at turn 55, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n\nAfter turn 55, if not eaten, life span 1, then after turn 56, gone.\n\nSo I have only this turn or next to eat it, but next turn head might not be able to reach it.\n\nFor example, if I go left or right now, from (4,5), to (3,5) or (5,5), then from there, to (4,6) might not be direct.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), but (3,6) not (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go U to (5,6) or L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body.\n\nSo to reach (4,6) from other positions, it's harder.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) on turn 55, then on turn 56, from (3,5), I could go U to (3,6), or R to (4,5) but occupied, or D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), from (3,5) it's not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,5) but (4,5) occupied.\n\nSo I can't reach (4,6) directly from (3,5) in one move; only from (4,5) or (4,7) invalid or (3,6) or (5,6), but (3,6) is adjacent to (4,6)? (3,6) and (4,6) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go U to (3,6), then I am at (3,6), and (4,6) is adjacent right.\n\nBut on turn 56, if I am at (3,6), I can go R to (4,6) if it's still there.\n\nBut on turn 56, after turn 55, if not eaten, life span of (4,6) decreases to 1, then after turn 56, it becomes 0 and disappears, so on turn 56, it is still there with life span 1, so I can eat it on turn 56 if I move to it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,5) on turn 55, then on turn 56 from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6), then (4,6) is adjacent left, so on turn 57 I could go L to (4,6), but on turn 57, after turn 56, if not eaten, it disappears, so only turn 56 is possible to eat (4,6), and only if I am at (3,6) or (5,6) on turn 56.\n\nBut let's timeline:\n\nTurn 55: current, life span of (4,6) is 2. After turn 55, if not eaten, life span becomes 1.\n\nThen turn 56: if eaten on turn 56, it is consumed. After turn 56, if not eaten, life span 0, gone.\n\nSo to eat (4,6), I must move to it on turn 55 or turn 56.\n\nOn turn 55, from current position (4,5), I can move U directly to it.\n\nOn turn 56, I can move to it only if I am at (4,5), (3,6), (5,6), or (4,7) invalid.\n\nSo from current, if I move to (3,5) or (5,5) on turn 55, then on turn 56, I am at (3,5) or (5,5), neither of which is adjacent to (4,6).\n\nFrom (3,5), adjacent cells: (3,6) U, (3,4) D, (2,5) L, (4,5) R but occupied.\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent to (3,5); it's diagonal or something, but not sharing edge.\n\nSimilarly from (5,5), adjacent are (5,6), (5,4), (4,5) occupied, (6,5).\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent.\n\nSo to reach (4,6) on turn 56, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 56.\n\nThe cells adjacent to (4,6) are: (4,5), (4,7) invalid, (3,6), (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is occupied by snake body, so on turn 56, if I move, (4,5) might be different.\n\nBut on turn 56, from whatever position, to move to (4,6), I need to be at (3,6), (5,6), or (4,5), but (4,5) is likely occupied.\n\nFor example, if on turn 55 I move to (3,5), then on turn 56, head at (3,5), body includes (4,5) etc, so (4,5) is occupied, so I cannot move to (4,5) from there.\n\nSimilarly, the only way to be at (3,6) or (5,6) on turn 56 is to move there on turn 55 or from previous.\n\nOn turn 55, from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), or L to (3,5), or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I move L to (3,5) on turn 55, then on turn 56, from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), for example.\n\nThen at (3,6), I can move R to (4,6) on turn 56, if I want.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,5) on turn 55, then on turn 56 move U to (5,6), then on turn 56 at (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) on turn 56.\n\nBut on turn 56, moving to (4,6) eats it, since life span 1.\n\nBut on turn 55, if I go directly U, I eat it now.\n\nGoing indirectly means I might miss it if something happens, but in this case, it should be possible.\n\nHowever, there is risk: when I go to (3,6) or (5,6), I need to make sure it's safe.\n\nBut more importantly, for long-term, I need to consider other food and survival.\n\nNow, the food at (2,2) has life span 4, so I have until turn 58 to eat it, but it's under body, so I need to expose it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) under tail, life span 10, plenty of time.\n\n(6,5) life span 7.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (3,1), but not relevant for now.\n\nNow, if I eat (4,6) now, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver in the tight space.\n\nThe snake is long, 16, and the grid is 6x6 minus walls, so 36 cells minus walls and obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (3,1) blocked, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 16 cells, so 19 free cells, but some have food.\n\nFood at (4,6), (2,2) occupied, (6,5), (2,4) occupied, so two free food, two under snake.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), snake 17 cells, free cells 18.\n\nBut (2,2) and (2,4) have food under, so when exposed, I can eat.\n\nBut the space is limited, and the snake is coiled, so I need to uncoil or something to survive long-term.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid growing now to have more space.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so I should eat positive food when possible, but prioritize survival.\n\nIf I eat (4,6), I get +1, but then I am at (4,6), which is cornered, with limited moves.\n\nFrom (4,6), after eating, I can only go L or R, since U wall, D to (4,5) body.\n\nSo to (3,6) or (5,6).\n\nSay I go L to (3,6), no food, then tail advances, exposing (2,4) food? Tail was at (2,4), after move, if no eat, tail advances to (2,5), so (2,4) exposed.\n\nThen I am at (3,6), with food at (2,4) exposed.\n\nBut (2,4) is at (2,4), I am at (3,6), not adjacent.\n\nI could move towards it.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go D to (3,5), but (3,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) from (4,6), let's trace.\n\nTurn 55: move U to (4,6), eat, positions as above.\n\nTurn 56: move L to (3,6), no food there, so no eat.\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nBody: old head (4,6) becomes neck, then (4,5), (4,4), ..., down to old pos15: (2,5), and old tail (2,4) removed, so new tail is (2,5).\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail.\n\nFood at (2,4) is now exposed and available.\n\nAlso, food at (2,2) is still under body, at position (2,2) which is now the 10th segment or something.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) invalid, D to (3,5), L to (2,6), R to (4,6) but (4,6) is now body, occupied.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nD to (3,5): is (3,5) free? In new positions, no (3,5), so free.\n\nL to (2,6): (2,6) is in positions, it's the 15th segment? Positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\n(2,6) is the 16th segment, so occupied. Index: head 0:(3,6), 1:(4,6), 2:(4,5), 3:(4,4), 4:(4,3), 5:(5,3), 6:(5,2), 7:(4,2), 8:(3,2), 9:(2,2), 10:(1,2), 11:(1,3), 12:(1,4), 13:(1,5), 14:(1,6), 15:(2,6), 16:(2,5) tail.\n\nSo (2,6) is position 15, occupied, so I cannot move L to (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is not in list, so free.\n\nSo from (3,6), only possible move is D to (3,5).\n\nMove D to (3,5), no food there, so no eat.\n\nNew head (3,5), body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), ..., down to (2,6), and tail (2,5) removed, new tail (2,6).\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\nFood at (2,4) is exposed but not eaten, and I am at (3,5).\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is not occupied now, but I am at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nI could go to (2,5) or something.\n\nBut (2,5) was tail, but now it's removed.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go L to (2,5), D to (3,4), R to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, U to (3,6) occupied.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,5) or D to (3,4).\n\n(2,5) is free? Not in positions, so free.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), then I am closer to (2,4).\n\n(2,5) to (2,4) is D.\n\nBut there is food at (2,4), so if I go to (2,4), I can eat it.\n\nBut tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (2,6), head at (3,5), not adjacent to tail.\n\nIf I move to (2,5), no food, so no issue.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go D to (2,4) to eat food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nThe point is, after eating (4,6), I am forced to move left or right, then down, and it might be ok, but the snake is still coiled, and I might run into issues later.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,6) now, I can go to (5,5) for example, to reach (6,5) food.\n\nLet's consider not eating (4,6) and going right.\n\nTurn 55: move R to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is free, no food, so no eat.\n\nNew head: (5,5)\n\nBody: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), and tail (2,4) removed, new tail (2,5).\n\nNew positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nFood at (2,4) exposed.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5) occupied, R to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has food! Value 1, life span 7.\n\nSo I can go R to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nOr U to (5,6), or D to (5,4).\n\nIf I go R to (6,5), eat food, grow.\n\nThen new head (6,5), body: (5,5), (4,5), ..., down to (2,5), and tail (2,4) was removed earlier, so new tail is (2,5)? After eating, tail doesn't advance.\n\nCurrent before move: head (5,5), body to tail (2,5)\n\nMove R to (6,5) eat, so new head (6,5), then body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail. Length 17.\n\nThen from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5) occupied, R to (7,5) wall.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nU to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nNo food there, so I can go, say, D to (6,4), no eat, tail advances, etc.\n\nBut I have eaten (6,5) food.\n\n(4,6) food disappears soon, but I didn't eat it.\n\nIn this path, I ate (6,5) instead.\n\nBut (4,6) is lost if I don't eat it by turn 56.\n\nIn this case, on turn 55 I went to (5,5), then turn 56 to (6,5), ate that, so (4,6) not eaten, and after turn 56 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left on turn 55.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,2) and (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is exposed when tail moves, as in both cases.\n\n(2,2) is still under body.\n\nTo expose (2,2), the segment on it must move.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is occupied, and as the snake moves, that segment will move to the next position.\n\nFor example, in the initial state, the segment at (2,2) will move to where the next segment is, but it's fixed in the chain.\n\nWhen the snake moves, each segment advances to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nSo for example, when head moves, the segment at (2,2) will move to the position that was previously occupied by the segment before it, which is (3,2) or something.\n\nIn initial positions, the segment at index 7: (2,2) will move to the position of index 6, which is (3,2), when the head moves.\n\nBut (3,2) is occupied by index 6, so when head moves, index 6 moves to index 5 position? Let's not confuse.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the cell of the previous segment.\n\nSo for the segment that was at (2,2), it will move to the cell that was occupied by the segment that was before it, which is (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, the cell (2,2) is vacated, unless a new segment is added.\n\nIf no food eaten, (2,2) is vacated, and food there can be eaten if head moves to it later.\n\nIf food eaten, the tail stays, so (2,2) might not be vacated immediately.\n\nIn this case, for (2,2), it is occupied by a body segment, not tail, so when the snake moves without eating, that segment moves away, vacating (2,2), and the food is exposed.\n\nSimilarly for tail, when tail moves, it vacates the cell.\n\nIn initial state, if I move without eating, the segment at (2,2) moves to (3,2), so (2,2) is free, and food there can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, tail at (2,4) moves to (2,5) or something, vacating (2,4).\n\nSo in general, when the snake moves without eating, all body segments advance, so the cells are vacated except for the new positions.\n\nFood under body can be exposed after one move.\n\nFor example, on turn 55, if I move without eating, say to (3,5) or (5,5), then after move, (2,2) and (2,4) are exposed because the segments moved away.\n\nThen I can eat them later.\n\nBut (2,4) is food, and (2,2) is food.\n\nAlso, (4,6) is available for one more turn.\n\nSo let's compare the options.\n\nFirst option: turn 55 move U to (4,6), eat food, grow to 17. Then I am at (4,6) with limited moves, must go to (3,6) or (5,6), say (3,6), then must go to (3,5), then I can go to (2,5) or (3,4), etc. But I have exposed (2,4) food, which I can eat later.\n\nSecond option: turn 55 move L to (3,5), no eat. Then after move, (2,2) and (2,4) are exposed because segments moved. New head at (3,5), body: as earlier, tail at (2,5), food at (2,2) and (2,4) are free.\n\n(2,2) and (2,4) both have food.\n\nHead at (3,5), so I can go to (2,5) or (3,4) or (3,6), etc.\n\n(2,5) is free? In new positions after move L to (3,5), tail at (2,5), but (2,5) is the tail position, so occupied.\n\nPositions after move L: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,4), ..., (2,6), (2,5) tail. So (2,5) occupied.\n\nFood at (2,2) and (2,4) are free.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (3,4), U to (3,6), R to (4,5) occupied.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nSay U to (3,6), no food, then head to (3,6), body advances, tail moves, etc.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (2,6) or something to reach the food.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go D to (3,4), then to (2,4) to eat food there.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 55: move L to (3,5), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail.\n\nFood at (2,2) exposed, (2,4) exposed, (4,6) still there with life span 1.\n\nAt turn 56, head at (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or U to (3,6).\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), no food, then new head (3,4), body: (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail (2,6) removed, new tail (2,6)? Old tail (2,5) removed, new tail is the previous, (2,6).\n\nPositions: new head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\nFood at (2,4) is free, and I am at (3,4), so I can go L to (2,4) next turn to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is free but occupied by body now? (2,2) is in positions, it's the 10th segment, so occupied again? After move, (2,2) is still occupied because the segment moved to it or something.\n\nInitially after turn 55 move, (2,2) is free.\n\nAfter turn 56 move to (3,4), the segment that was at (2,2) moves to where? The body segments shift.\n\nThe segment that was at index 9: (2,2) moves to the position of index 8, which was (1,2)? Let's not.\n\nIn new positions after turn 56: head (3,4), then seg1: (3,5), seg2: (4,5), seg3: (4,4), seg4: (4,3), seg5: (5,3), seg6: (5,2), seg7: (4,2), seg8: (3,2), seg9: (2,2), seg10: (1,2), seg11: (1,3), seg12: (1,4), seg13: (1,5), seg14: (1,6), seg15: (2,6) tail.\n\nSo (2,2) is now occupied by seg9, and food is there, so it's under body again.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is free.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go L to (2,4) to eat food, or U to (3,5) occupied, D to (3,3), R to (4,4) occupied.\n\n(4,4) is seg3, occupied.\n\n(3,5) seg1, occupied.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,4) or D to (3,3).\n\n(2,4) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nGo L to (2,4), eat food.\n\nThen grow, etc.\n\nBut I missed (4,6) food, which disappeared.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right on turn 55.\n\nFor long-term survival, the grid has limited space, and the snake is long, so growing might reduce the free space faster.\n\nBut there are other food to eat.\n\nThe food at (6,5) is also available.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize not growing if it leads to dead end.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is at (2,4), with food under it, and head is at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nIf I can move the tail away and then eat the food at (2,4) when head is adjacent, but without tail reward danger.\n\nBut currently not adjacent.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,2) is closer.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAssume I go up on turn 55.\n\nTurn 55: U to (4,6) eat.\n\nTurn 56: from (4,6), go L to (3,6) (assume, since R similar)\n\nTurn 57: from (3,6), only D to (3,5) as earlier.\n\nTurn 58: from (3,5), go L to (2,5) or D to (3,4).\n\nSay go L to (2,5), no food.\n\nThen head at (2,5), body includes (3,5), (3,6), etc.\n\nThen I can go D to (2,4) to eat food if available.\n\nBut food at (2,4) is exposed after turn 56, but if I don't eat it, it might be there.\n\nLife span 10, plenty.\n\nBut after turn 57, at (2,5), I can go D to (2,4) eat.\n\nThen grow.\n\nBut the snake is getting longer.\n\nIf on turn 55 I go right to (5,5), then turn 56 to (6,5) eat, then I am at (6,5), can go U to (6,6) or D to (6,4), say D to (6,4), then I can explore.\n\nBut the left side food might be harder to reach.\n\nPerhaps for survival, I should avoid the (4,6) food because it's in a corner and eating it might trap me.\n\nBut let's see the free space.\n\nAfter not eating, I have more room to move.\n\nBut I need to eat to score.\n\nAnother point: all food is positive, so eating is good for score, but bad for space.\n\nBut the game is to maximize score, so I should eat when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nThe risk of eating (4,6) is that I am at (4,6) with only two moves, both of which might lead to restricted movement.\n\nWhereas if I go to (5,5), I have more options.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) has options.\n\nAlso, (4,6) has short life, so if I don't eat it, I lose it, but it's only +1.\n\nWhereas (6,5) has life span 7, so I can eat it later.\n\n(2,4) and (2,2) have longer life.\n\nSo perhaps I can sacrifice (4,6) for better position.\n\nBut let's see the map.\n\nGrid:\n\nLet's sketch mentally.\n\ny=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) food, (5,6), (6,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) head, (5,5), (6,5) food\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4) food/tail, (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2) food/body, (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) but (3,1) wall below, but (3,2) is ok.\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) wall, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nBut y=0 and y=7 walls, so not accessible.\n\nSnake: head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) tail.\n\nSo the snake occupies the left and bottom.\n\nFree cells: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,6)? (3,6) not occupied, (4,6) food, (5,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5) food, (6,4), (6,3), (6,6), (6,2), (2,3), (2,1) etc.\n\nList free cells with no snake and no wall.\n\nCells: x1-6, y1-6 except (3,1) wall.\n\nOccupied by snake: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo snake: 16 cells.\n\nFood at (4,6), (2,2), (6,5), (2,4) but (2,2) and (2,4) occupied, so not free.\n\nFree food: (4,6) and (6,5)\n\nFree cells without food: (1,1), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) has food, (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,6), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,3), etc.\n\n(4,1) is free, etc.\n\nNumber of free cells: 35 total cells minus 16 snake minus 1 wall = 18 free cells, including 2 with food and 16 without.\n\n35-16-1=18, yes.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), snake 17, free 17 cells.\n\nIf I eat (6,5), similar.\n\nBut to survive long, I need to have a path to move without colliding.\n\nThe snake is coiled in the left, so moving right might open up space.\n\nPerhaps moving right to (5,5) then to (6,5) to eat, then I can move down or up on the right side.\n\nWhereas if I go up to (4,6), I am stuck on the top row.\n\nSo for long-term, moving right might be better.\n\nAlso, by not eating (4,6), I can expose the food at (2,2) and (2,4) quickly.\n\nFor example, if I move to (5,5) on turn 55, then (2,2) and (2,4) are exposed on turn 56.\n\nThen I can eat them later.\n\nLife span of (2,2) is 4, so after turn 55, life span 3, then 2, then 1, gone after turn 58.\n\nSo I have time to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) life span 10, plenty.\n\nSo let's decide.\n\nI think for better survival, I should avoid the corner and move to the center or right.\n\nSo on turn 55, move R to (5,5).\n\nThen on turn 56, from (5,5), I can move R to (6,5) to eat food, or U to (5,6), or D to (5,4).\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), I eat and grow.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move U or D.\n\nSay move D to (6,4), then I can continue.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,4) is exposed, so I can go left to eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) exposed.\n\nBut the snake is long, so it might take time to reach the left.\n\nBut with life span, it should be ok.\n\nTo prioritize survival, not eating and moving to open space might be better.\n\nBut all moves except down are possible, down is blocked.\n\nSo U, L, R.\n\nU has food but risk, L and R no food but expose other food.\n\nSince the AI should maximize score, eating the available food might be good, but with long-term view.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,6) and then manage.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger for (2,4).\n\nWhen I eat (2,4), if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but in general, when I eat food at a cell, if that cell was the tail position, and head is adjacent, it might be dangerous, but the rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nBut when I eat the food, the tail cell has food, but after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, so if head was adjacent to tail before, after eating, the head is on the food, and the tail is still there, so they are adjacent or not?\n\nFor example, if head is at (2,5), tail at (2,4), adjacent, and (2,4) has food, if I move to (2,4), I eat it, then head moves to (2,4), and tail remains at (2,4)? No.\n\nPositions: before move, head at (2,5), tail at (2,4), say.\n\nI move to (2,4), eat food.\n\nNew head at (2,4)\n\nThen the body includes the old head (2,5), and the old body, and the tail (2,4) is still there? No.\n\nWhen I eat, the tail does not advance, so the new positions are: new head at (2,4), then the old head (2,5), then the old body segments, and the old tail (2,4) is still part of the snake, so I have two segments at (2,4), which is collision, so the snake dies.\n\nThat's the tail reward danger.\n\nSo if head is adjacent to tail and I move to the tail cell to eat food, I die because after eating, the head and tail are on the same cell or adjacent in a way that causes collision.\n\nIn this case, head and tail both at (2,4) after eating, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat food on the tail cell if the head is adjacent to the tail.\n\nIn this state, head at (4,5), tail at (2,4), not adjacent, so no danger for (2,4) yet.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nI think I'll go with moving right to avoid the corner.\n\nSo turn 55: move R to (5,5)\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide actions for turn 55 and future turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but the answer format is to list actions for the current and future turns.\n\nBut I only need to decide for turn 55 now, and the state will update.\n\nThe question is to output the action for turn 55, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to consider the sequence, but for the answer, I think I need to provide the action for turn 55.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since the state changes, I can only decide for turn 55, and the rest depends.\n\nPerhaps I should provide a sequence based on the current state.\n\nBut it's dynamic.\n\nI think for this response, I need to output the action for turn 55.\n\nBased on thinking ahead, I'll choose to move Right.\n\nSo action for turn 55: R\n\nThen for turn 56, it depends, but I can suggest.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps I should eat the food to not waste it.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nAnother idea: if I move U to (4,6), eat, then on turn 56 move to (5,6), then I am at (5,6), which is better than (3,6).\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go R to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, no food.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go U to (5,7) invalid, D to (5,5), L to (4,6) occupied, R to (6,6).\n\nSo D or R.\n\nD to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nAnd (2,4) exposed, etc.\n\nSo not too bad.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R first, I can eat (6,5).\n\nBoth have risks.\n\nBut to maximize, I think eating (4,6) now is fine.\n\nSince life span short, I should eat it.\n\nAnd it's +1.\n\nSo I'll go Up.\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nThen for the sequence, I can plan.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to list multiple turns.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but \"Answer Format: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence of actions for several turns based on current state.\n\nBut the state changes after each move, so it's not possible to predict exactly, but I can assume no new food or something, but the food life span decreases.\n\nPerhaps I can simulate.\n\nLet me try to plan 5 turns.\n\nTurn 55: move U to (4,6) eat food.\n\nNew head position: (4,6)\n\nDirection: U (since moved up)\n\nFood eaten: (4,6) removed.\n\nOther food: (2,2) life span 4-1=3? After turn 55, all food life span decrease.\n\nAt turn 55, before move, life span as given.\n\nAfter turn 55, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n\nBut if eaten, it's removed.\n\nFor (4,6), eaten, removed.\n\nFor others, after turn 55, life span decrease by 1.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nTurn 55: move U\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,6), move R to (5,6) (assume, to avoid left which might be tighter)\n\n(5,6) no food, so no eat.\n\nNew head: (5,6)\n\nBody: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), and tail (2,4) removed, new tail (2,5)? After no eat, tail advances.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail.\n\nFood at (2,4) exposed, life span 10-1=9 after turn 55, then after turn 56, 8.\n\n(2,2) still under body? (2,2) is occupied, food under, life span 4-1=3 after turn 55, then after turn 56, 2.\n\n(6,5) life span 7-1=6 after turn 55, then after turn 56, 5.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction R (since moved right from (4,6)? From (4,6) to (5,6) is R, so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: D to (5,5), R to (6,6), U invalid, L to (4,6) occupied.\n\nSo D or R.\n\nSay move D to (5,5), no food.\n\nNew head (5,5), body: (5,6), (4,6), etc., tail advances to (2,6).\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail. (2,5) removed.\n\nFood at (2,4) exposed, (2,2) still under.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move to (6,5) to eat food there.\n\nMove R to (6,5), eat.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this is messy.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide turn 55 action as U.\n\nThen for turn 56, I can say R, but it's not necessary.\n\nSince the format requires multiple turns, I'll provide a sequence.\n\nBut to save time, I'll decide on turn 55: U\n\nThen for turn 56, from there, move R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 57: from (5,6), move D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 58: from (5,5), move R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 59: from (6,5), move D to (6,4)\n\netc.\n\nBut it's arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps for this case, moving to (4,6) is ok.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and simulated possible moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (4,6) has a short life span (2 at turn 55, decreasing to 1 after turn 55 and disappearing after turn 56). Eating it now secures +1 score and avoids losing it. Other foods have longer life spans: (2,2) life span 4, (6,5) life span 7, (2,4) life span 10, so they can be targeted later.\n- **Risk Assessment**: Moving Up to (4,6) eats the food but places the snake in a corner (only Left or Right moves possible next). However, with careful planning, the snake can navigate to open space and avoid collisions. Moving Left or Right avoids immediate risk but misses the (4,6) food, reducing potential score.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (4,6), moving Right to (5,6) opens access to the right side of the grid, where (6,5) food is available. The snake can then maneuver to eat (6,5) and expose/consume other foods like (2,4) and (2,2) as the body moves. Growing to length 17 is manageable in the 6x6 grid (35 cells minus walls/snake), as 18 free cells remain initially, and the snake can avoid dead ends by heading toward less cluttered areas.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: No immediate body or wall collisions from moving Up. Tail reward danger is not triggered for (2,4) food, as the head is not adjacent to the tail. Food under the body (e.g., (2,2)) will be exposed as the snake moves and can be eaten later.\n\n**Planned Sequence (5 turns):**\n- **Turn 55**: Move Up (U) to (4,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length 17). This must be done now due to the short life span.\n- **Turn 56**: Move Right (R) to (5,6) to avoid the left-side congestion and access the right grid. No food here, so tail advances, exposing (2,4) food.\n- **Turn 57**: Move Down (D) to (5,5) to position for eating (6,5) next turn. No food, tail advances.\n- **Turn 58**: Move Right (R) to (6,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length 18). Life span allows this (5 after turn 56, 4 after turn 57).\n- **Turn 59**: Move Down (D) to (6,4) to avoid the top wall and explore lower areas. No food, tail advances.\n\nThis sequence nets +2 score in 5 turns while maintaining safety:  \n- No wall or body collisions occur.  \n- The snake moves away from the crowded left/top, reducing entanglement risk.  \n- Foods (2,4) and (2,2) are exposed by turn 56 and can be targeted beyond turn 59 (life spans 8 and 2 after turn 56, respectively).  \n- If needed, adjust later moves to eat exposed foods or avoid new risks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: R \\\\\nTurn 57: D \\\\\nTurn 58: R \\\\\nTurn 59: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 56. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders and that one internal point.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,6), and the body segments follow. The head direction is Up, so it's moving upwards.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 3\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (2,4) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. So, I should plan a sequence of moves for the next few turns, starting from turn 56.\n\nFirst, let's map out the snake's body to understand where it is and possible collisions.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nHead is (4,6), direction Up. Since it's moving Up, from (4,6), moving Up would go to (4,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's not possible. y=7 is the top border wall. So moving Up from (4,6) to (4,7) would hit the wall, which is deadly. Therefore, I cannot move Up.\n\nCurrent head direction is Up, but moving Up is impossible because it's at y=6, and y=7 is wall. So I need to change direction.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but since head direction is Up, I cannot instantly reverse to Down. So I can move Left or Right, but not Down or Up (Up is wall, Down might be possible but let's see).\n\nNo instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down. So I cannot move Down on this turn. But since Up is blocked by wall, my only options are Left or Right.\n\nHead is at (4,6). Moving Left would be to (3,6), moving Right to (5,6).\n\nNow, I need to check if these cells are safe: not wall, not body.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and (3,1). (3,6) is not a wall, x=3 is between 1 and 6, y=6 is not 0 or 7. Similarly, (5,6) should be fine.\n\nBody positions: let's list all body cells to avoid.\n\nSnake positions: (4,6) head, (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is a body segment? But there's food at (2,4) with value 1, life span 9. Food can be under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there later.\n\nIn this case, (2,4) is occupied by a body segment, so the food there is under the snake. Similarly, (2,2) has food with life span 3, and it's also a body segment? Let's see: (2,2) is in the snake positions, so yes, occupied.\n\nBut for moving, at turn 56, head is at (4,6), so possible moves:\n\n- Left to (3,6): is (3,6) occupied? Snake positions: (1,6) and (2,6) are there, but (3,6) is not listed. Let's list all coordinates:\n\nBody: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo (3,6) is not in the list, so it should be empty. Similarly, (5,6) is not listed, so empty.\n\n(1,6) is at y=6, x=1, (2,6) at x=2,y=6, so (3,6) is between x=2 and x=4? x=3,y=6 not occupied, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) not occupied.\n\nWalls: (3,1) is wall, but (3,6) is fine.\n\nSo both (3,6) and (5,6) are possible moves.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead. Also, food locations: (2,2), (6,5), (2,4)\n\n(2,2) is currently occupied by the snake body, and it has food with life span 3. But since it's under the body, it can't be eaten yet.\n\n(2,4) is also occupied by body and has food.\n\n(6,5) is free, I think. (6,5) not in snake positions, so yes.\n\nLife spans: (2,2) life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn 56, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 58? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (2,2), life span 3 at turn 56: after turn 56, countdown to 2; after turn 57, to 1; after turn 58, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 56, 57, or 58, but only if head moves to it when it's exposed.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 6: disappears after turn 61? Turn 56: life 6, turn 57:5, ..., turn 61:0, so disappears before turn 62? After N turns from now, meaning after N steps.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L more turns, so it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, countdown is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nSo the food is present for turns when countdown > 0.\n\nAt turn t, countdown = L, it can be eaten on this turn.\n\nAfter turn t, at turn t+1, countdown = L-1, and so on, until countdown =1 at turn t+L-1, and after turn t+L-1, it disappears, so not present at turn t+L.\n\nFor (2,2) at turn 56: life span 3, so present at turn 56 (countdown 3), turn 57 (2), turn 58 (1), disappears after turn 58, so not at turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 6: present from turn 56 to 61 (countdown 6 to 1), disappears after turn 61.\n\n(2,4) life span 9: present from turn 56 to 64.\n\nNow, back to possible moves for turn 56.\n\nHead at (4,6), direction Up, but Up to (4,7) is wall, so impossible. Cannot move Down because reverse not allowed. So only Left or Right.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (3,6)\n\nOption 2: Move Right to (5,6)\n\nI need to evaluate both and think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a food at (6,5), which might be a target.\n\nBut I need to survive and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens if I move Left to (3,6).\n\nAfter move to (3,6), the snake head is at (3,6), and the tail will move. When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten. Since no food at (3,6), I assume? Is there food at (3,6)? Food positions are (2,2), (6,5), (2,4), so no, (3,6) no food.\n\nSo after moving to (3,6), the new head is (3,6), and the tail (2,4) is removed? Snake positions: after move, head to (3,6), then body: previous head was (4,6), which becomes body, so positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)] and tail (2,4) is removed since no food eaten.\n\nSnake was 17 segments long? Positions list has 17 elements: head + 16 body, so length 17.\n\nAfter move without eating, length same, tail removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), and (2,5) is now the last, but (2,5) was second last, after tail removed, the new tail is what was previously the second last.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0 to 16, head 0: (4,6), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,4), ..., up to 16: (2,4)\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), new head is (3,6), then segment 0 becomes body: so body at (4,6), which was head, and segments 1 to 16, but since no food, we remove the last segment, which was (2,4), so positions become: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)] so (2,5) is now the tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move Right to (5,6), new head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), ..., and remove (2,4), so positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nNow, head direction: after moving Left, head is at (3,6), and I moved Left, so new direction is Left.\n\nSimilarly, if move Right, new direction Right.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and survival.\n\nThere is food at (6,5), which is at x=6,y=5. From (5,6), I can go Down to (5,5), then Left to (4,5) or Right to (6,5), but (6,5) has food.\n\n(6,5) is within grid, x=6 is not wall? x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok, y=5 ok.\n\nBut from (5,6), moving Down to (5,5) is possible, then from (5,5) to (6,5) is Right.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 56, I need to choose Left or Right.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,4) and (2,2) under the body, but they might become available later.\n\nFor example, (2,4) is currently occupied, but if the snake moves away, it could be eaten later.\n\nBut life span is long, 9 turns.\n\n(2,2) has shorter life, only 3 turns including current.\n\nAt turn 56, (2,2) is occupied, so it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from it.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is part of the body, position index 9 in the list: (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is index 16.\n\nThe snake will move, so if the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells might be vacated.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat food, the tail moves forward, so (2,4) might be vacated soon.\n\nIn the current state, tail is at (2,4). When I move, if I don't eat, tail is removed, so (2,4) is vacated, and since food is there, it should be available to eat, but only if head moves there, but it's not adjacent yet.\n\nAfter move, the cell (2,4) is empty, and food is there, so it can be eaten if head goes to (2,4) in future.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2), it will be vacated later as the snake moves.\n\nBut (2,2) has shorter life span.\n\nLet's simulate both options.\n\nFirst, option: move Left to (3,6) at turn 56.\n\nThen new positions: head (3,6), body: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // 17 segments, same length.\n\nNow, head at (3,6), direction Left.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to Right (since current dir Left, reverse is Right, so cannot move Right).\n\nAlso, walls: U to (3,7) y=7 wall, impossible.\n\nD to (3,5): is that safe? (3,5) not in positions? Positions: (3,6) head, (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), etc., (4,5) is at (4,5), not (3,5). (3,5) not listed, so empty? But there is internal wall at (3,1), but (3,5) is not wall.\n\nSo D to (3,5) possible.\n\nL to (2,6): (2,6) is in positions, it's a body segment, so collision if I move there.\n\n(2,6) is in the list, index 15 or something, it's occupied.\n\nR to (4,6): but (4,6) is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) wall, impossible\n\n- D: (3,5) - let's see if occupied. Positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\n(3,5) not in list, so empty. Safe.\n\n- L: (2,6) - (2,6) is in positions, occupied by body, collision.\n\n- R: (4,6) - (4,6) is body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move from (3,6) is Down to (3,5).\n\nIf I move Left at turn 56, I must move Down at turn 57 to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 57, head to (3,5), no food there, so tail moves, remove (2,5).\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\n(2,5) removed, so (2,6) is now tail or something.\n\nList: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\nHead direction: moved Down, so now Down.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot reverse, so cannot move Up (since current dir Down, reverse Up).\n\nU to (3,6): but (3,6) is body segment now, collision.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) not in positions? Positions above: (3,5) head, (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc. (4,5) is at (4,5), not (3,4). (3,4) not listed, so empty? But let's check if wall: (3,1) is wall, but (3,4) is not, so should be safe.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) not in positions? Positions: (2,6) is there, (1,5), etc. (2,5) was removed earlier, so empty. But is there food? Food at (2,4), (2,2), etc., not (2,5).\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) is body, position index 3 or 4, it's occupied, collision.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,5):\n\n- U: (3,6) body, collision, impossible\n\n- D: (3,4) empty, possible\n\n- L: (2,5) empty, possible\n\n- R: (4,5) body, collision, impossible\n\nSo can move Down to (3,4) or Left to (2,5).\n\nThis is getting messy. Let's consider the other initial option.\n\nAt turn 56, move Right to (5,6).\n\nThen new positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // and (2,4) removed.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction Right.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot reverse, so cannot move Left (opposite of Right).\n\nU to (5,7): y=7 wall, impossible.\n\nD to (5,5): (5,5) not in positions? Positions: (5,6) head, (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), etc. (4,5) at (4,5), (5,5) not listed, so empty. Safe.\n\nL to (4,6): (4,6) is body, collision.\n\nR to (6,6): (6,6) not wall? x=6, y=6, x=7 is wall, so x=6 ok, y=6 ok. Not occupied, so safe.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\nNow, there is food at (6,5), which is below (6,6).\n\nIf I go Right to (6,6), then from there, I can go Down to (6,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, at turn 56, if I move Right to (5,6), then at turn 57, I can move to (6,6) or (5,5).\n\nIf I move to (6,6), then at turn 58, I can move Down to (6,5) to eat the food, since (6,5) has food.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nAlso, I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFrom (6,6), moving Down to (6,5), is (6,5) safe? At that time, it should be, but let's see the body.\n\nMoreover, after eating at (6,5), the head is there, and snake grows, so new positions include the food cell.\n\nBut first, let's plan.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,2) has short life, only until turn 58.\n\nAt turn 56, it's occupied, so it needs to be vacated and head moved there.\n\nCurrently, (2,2) is occupied, and it's not the tail. The tail is at (2,4) or after move, it changes.\n\nIn the initial state, after move at turn 56, if I move Right, positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nSo (2,2) is still occupied.\n\nAt turn 57, if I move, say, to (6,6), then new head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), etc., tail (2,5) removed, so (2,2) still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, it will take a few turns for (2,2) to be vacated.\n\nThe body segment at (2,2) is fixed until the snake moves past it.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be vacated when the tail moves away, but the tail is moving.\n\nIn this case, after turn 56, tail is at (2,5) if I moved Right.\n\nLet's list the positions in order.\n\nAfter turn 56 move Right: positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nSo the tail is (2,5), and (2,2) is at index 9.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed each time, so (2,2) will be vacated after 8 moves or something? Not necessarily, because the snake is moving.\n\nFor example, at turn 57, if I move to (6,6), new head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // and tail (2,5) removed, so (2,2) still there.\n\nAt turn 58, if I move to (6,5), and eat food there, then head to (6,5), food eaten, so tail not removed, new positions: head (6,5), then previous head (6,6) becomes body, so [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] and since ate, length increases, so no removal, positions have 18 segments.\n\n(2,2) is still occupied.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be vacated when the tail reaches it, but the tail is at (2,6) now, and it will move as the snake moves, but since we ate at (6,5), the tail is fixed until next move.\n\nTo vacate (2,2), it depends on the path.\n\nBut (2,2) has life span until turn 58, so at turn 58, it can be eaten if head is there, but at turn 58, if I'm at (6,5), head is far away, and (2,2) is still occupied or not?\n\nAt turn 56: food at (2,2) countdown 3\n\nTurn 57: countdown 2\n\nTurn 58: countdown 1, can be eaten\n\nTurn 59: disappears\n\nAt turn 58, if (2,2) is still occupied by snake body, it cannot be eaten, even if countdown>0.\n\nThe food can only be eaten if the head moves onto the cell when it is empty and food is there, but since it's under body, it must be vacated first.\n\nAt turn 58, if the snake body is still on (2,2), it can't be eaten.\n\nIn the current positions, (2,2) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n\nThe earliest it can be vacated is when the tail moves to it or past it.\n\nIn the positions after turn 56 move, (2,2) is at index 9, tail at index 16 (2,5).\n\nEach move without eating, the tail index moves forward, but the positions shift.\n\nAfter each move without eating, the tail is removed, so the body segment at the end is gone, so the cell is vacated, but for (2,2), it's not the tail yet.\n\nFor example, after turn 56 move, positions have 17 segments, tail at (2,5).\n\nAfter turn 57 move to (6,6) no eat, new head (6,6), body (5,6) to (2,6), tail (2,5) removed, so positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // 17 segments, tail at (2,6)\n\n(2,2) is still there.\n\nAfter turn 58, if move to (6,5) and eat, then no tail removal, positions grow: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // 18 segments, (2,2) still occupied.\n\nThen at turn 59, if I move somewhere without eating, tail (2,6) removed, so (2,6) vacated, but (2,2) still occupied.\n\n(2,2) is at index 11 now, it will take several moves to vacate.\n\nSpecifically, from the position, to vacate (2,2), the tail needs to reach it or the snake moves so that (2,2) becomes the tail.\n\nBut with the current path, it's slow.\n\nPerhaps it's not feasible to eat (2,2) in time, since life span short.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) has longer life.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate choice.\n\nAt turn 56, moving Left seems bad because it forces me to move Down to (3,5), and from there I have choices, but it might lead to dead end.\n\nMoving Right to (5,6) gives me access to the food at (6,5).\n\nAlso, the grid has an internal wall at (3,1), but it might not affect immediately.\n\nI should aim for the food at (6,5) since it's available and not under body.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nTurn 56: move Right to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 57: from (5,6), I can move Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\nIf I move Right to (6,6), then turn 58: move Down to (6,5) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,5), direction Down.\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move Up because current dir Down, reverse not allowed, so cannot U.\n\nD to (6,4): (6,4) not wall, not occupied yet? At that time, positions: after eating at turn 58, positions as above, but with head at (6,5), so body includes (6,6), (5,6), etc.\n\n(6,4) should be empty.\n\nL to (5,5): (5,5) may be empty or not.\n\nR to (7,5): x=7 wall, impossible.\n\nSo possible: Down to (6,4) or Left to (5,5).\n\nIf I go Down to (6,4), or Left to (5,5).\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (2,6) after eating, but it will move.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nSince I ate food, snake is longer, but I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), if I move Down to (6,4), then head to (6,4), new body segment at (6,5), tail (2,6) removed if no eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see the other choice at turn 57.\n\nAt turn 57 from (5,6), instead of moving Right, I could move Down to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) to eat, or other directions.\n\nBut (5,5) to (6,5) is Right, which might be possible.\n\nBut at turn 57, if I move Down to (5,5), no food, so tail removed, positions change.\n\nThen at turn 58, from (5,5) to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut life span of (6,5) is 6, so at turn 58 it's still there.\n\nBut moving to (5,5) first might not be necessary.\n\nLet's compare to moving Left initially.\n\nIf at turn 56 I move Left to (3,6), then as before, I must move Down to (3,5) at turn 57.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move Down to (3,4) or Left to (2,5).\n\nIf I move Down to (3,4), then head at (3,4), direction Down.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move Up (reverse).\n\nU to (3,5) body, collision.\n\nD to (3,3): (3,3) not occupied? Positions at that time: after turn 57 move to (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] let's assume after turn 57.\n\nAfter turn 56 move Left: positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nThen turn 57 move Down to (3,5): new head (3,5), body (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // tail (2,5) removed.\n\nNow at turn 58, from (3,5), move Down to (3,4): new head (3,4), body (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // tail (2,6) removed? After move, no eat, tail removed, which was (2,6) in previous, so removed, positions up to (1,6), but (1,6) is there.\n\nNew positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nHead at (3,4), direction Down.\n\nThen from (3,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,5): body, collision\n\nD to (3,3): (3,3) not occupied, empty\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) has food, but is it occupied? In positions, (2,2), (1,2), etc., (2,4) not listed, so empty, and food there.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nSo can move Down to (3,3) or Left to (2,4).\n\nIf I move Left to (2,4), I can eat the food there, since it's positive food.\n\n(2,4) has value 1, life span 9, so at turn 58, countdown 7 or something, still there.\n\nBut moving to (2,4) from (3,4) is Left, which is allowed.\n\nThen I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut is there any danger? Tail reward danger?\n\nTail is at (1,6), not adjacent to (2,4), so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, head at (2,4), new body segment, no tail removal.\n\nPositions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // 18 segments.\n\nThen from there, I can move.\n\nBut initially at turn 56, if I moved Left, I can reach (2,4) by turn 58.\n\nBut in the move to (2,4) at turn 58, I eat the food.\n\nNow, compare to moving Right at turn 56, I can eat (6,5) at turn 58.\n\nBoth seem possible, but I need to see which is better for survival.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,2) has short life, but it might not be reachable in time.\n\nFor example, from the Left path, at turn 58, I'm at (2,4) or (3,4), not at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is still occupied and will disappear after turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, in the Right path, (2,2) is far.\n\nSo probably not possible to eat (2,2), so ignore it.\n\nNow, between eating (6,5) or (2,4), both are +1, so same reward.\n\nBut I need to see the board state for long-term survival.\n\nThe snake is currently in a sort of loop or filled area.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and (3,1).\n\nCells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead (4,6)\n\nBody: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo the snake occupies many cells on the left and bottom.\n\nAvailable spaces: for example, (3,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), etc., also (3,5), (3,4), (5,5), (5,4), and so on.\n\n(2,4) has food but occupied.\n\nAfter moving, it might free up.\n\nIn the Left move option, after turn 58, I can eat (2,4) which is now free if I moved to it.\n\nIn the sequence where I move Left at 56, Down at 57 to (3,5), then at turn 58, from (3,5) I can move Left to (2,5) or Down to (3,4).\n\nIf I move to (2,5), let's see.\n\nFrom (3,5), move Left to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is empty at that time? After turn 57, positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\n(2,5) not in list, so empty. No food there.\n\nMove to (2,5), no eat, so tail (2,6) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // tail (2,6) removed.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction Left.\n\nThen from (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move Right (reverse).\n\nU to (2,6): but (2,6) was removed, so empty? But in positions, (1,6) is there, (2,6) not, so empty.\n\nD to (2,4): (2,4) has food, and is it occupied? Not in positions, so empty.\n\nL to (1,5): (1,5) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (3,5): body, occupied.\n\nSo possible: Up to (2,6) or Down to (2,4).\n\nIf Down to (2,4), eat food.\n\nOr Up to (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) might be available.\n\nIn this case, from (2,5), I can go Down to (2,4) to eat at turn 59 or something.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nBack to turn 56 choice.\n\nIf I move Right at turn 56 to (5,6), then to (6,6) at 57, then to (6,5) at 58 to eat.\n\nAfter that, head at (6,5), with body around.\n\nThe area around (6,5) might have space: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), etc.\n\n(5,5) is empty, I think.\n\nSimilarly, in the Left path, after eating at (2,4), I'm on the left side.\n\nBut the grid has more space on the right, since the snake is mostly on the left and bottom.\n\nFor example, cells like (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) is body, (3,4), (3,3), etc.\n\n(4,5) is body in some states.\n\nIn the long term, moving to the right might give more space to maneuver, while on the left, it might be cramped with the body.\n\nAlso, there is the internal wall at (3,1), but it's not blocking immediately.\n\nMoreover, for survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nIf I go left, after eating at (2,4), the head is at (2,4), with body above and below, so I might have limited moves.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) after eating, positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // from earlier.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (2,5): (2,5) not occupied? In positions, (1,5), (1,6), not (2,5), so empty.\n\nD to (2,3): (2,3) not occupied, empty.\n\nL to (1,4): (1,4) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (3,4): (3,4) is body, occupied.\n\nSo can move Up to (2,5) or Down to (2,3).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut it might be ok.\n\nOn the right, after eating at (6,5), head at (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // after turn 58 eat.\n\nThen from (6,5), moves: cannot Up (reverse Down), so U impossible.\n\nD to (6,4): empty\n\nL to (5,5): (5,5) empty? Not in positions, so empty.\n\nR to (7,5) wall, impossible.\n\nSo Down or Left.\n\nIf Down to (6,4), or Left to (5,5).\n\nMore space on the right.\n\nAlso, there might be future food, but not specified, so I need to maximize space for survival.\n\nMoreover, the food at (2,4) has long life, so I can eat it later, while (6,5) has life span 6, so I have until turn 61 to eat it, but it's available now.\n\nIn the Right move, I can eat it at turn 58.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I might lose it, but I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (2,4), it can be eaten later.\n\nBut to prioritize survival, moving right might be better.\n\nAnother risk: when I move to (6,6) at turn 57, from (5,6), moving to (6,6) is safe, but then to (6,5) is Down.\n\nIs there any danger of collision? At turn 58, when I move to (6,5), the body is at (6,6), (5,6), etc., not (6,5), so safe.\n\nAfter eating, the new body is at (6,6), so (6,5) is head, no issue.\n\nNow, for the initial move at turn 56, moving Right seems better.\n\nBut I need to output a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nStarting from turn 56.\n\nLet's define the sequence for moving Right.\n\nTurn 56: move Right to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 57: move Right to (6,6)  // to approach food\n\nTurn 58: move Down to (6,5) to eat food.\n\nNow, after that, at turn 59, head at (6,5), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves: Down to (6,4) or Left to (5,5)\n\nI need to choose which one.\n\n(6,4) is empty, (5,5) is empty.\n\nMoving Down to (6,4) might be towards the bottom, but y=0 wall, so I need to turn eventually.\n\nMoving Left to (5,5) might be towards the center.\n\nTo have more space, moving Left to (5,5) might be better, as (5,5) has more options.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (5,4), (6,5) is body, (4,5) might be body, etc.\n\nIn positions after turn 58: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\n(4,5) is body, so from (6,5), if I move Left to (5,5), (5,5) is empty, no food, so I can move there.\n\nThen at turn 59, move Left to (5,5)\n\nNew head (5,5), no eat, so tail (2,6) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]  // (2,6) removed.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction Left (since moved Left from (6,5)).\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move Right (reverse Left).\n\nU to (5,6): (5,6) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) not occupied, empty.\n\nL to (4,5): (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (6,5): body, occupied.\n\nSo only possible move Down to (5,4).\n\nMust move Down to (5,4).\n\nThen at turn 60, move Down to (5,4)\n\nNew head (5,4), no food, tail (1,6) removed.\n\nPositions: [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]  // tail (1,6) removed.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction Down.\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move Up (reverse).\n\nU to (5,5): body, collision.\n\nD to (5,3): (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nL to (4,4): (4,4) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (6,4): (6,4) not occupied, empty.\n\nSo only possible move Right to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 61, move Right to (6,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this seems like I'm forced into a path, and eventually I might hit a wall or body.\n\nFor example, at (6,4), I can go Down to (6,3) or Left to (5,4) which is body, etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is body now, so from (6,4), move Down to (6,3) or Up to (6,5) body, or Right to (7,4) wall.\n\nSo Down to (6,3) if possible.\n\nBut y=0 wall, so I need to turn left eventually.\n\nThis might be risky.\n\nAfter turn 58, when at (6,5), instead of moving Left to (5,5), I could move Down to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 59, head to (6,4), no eat, tail removed.\n\nPositions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // (1,6) removed? After move, tail was (1,6) or something.\n\nAfter turn 58 eat: positions 18 segments, head (6,5), body up to (1,6) and (2,6), but (2,6) is included.\n\nIn positions, (2,6) is there.\n\nAfter turn 59 move Down to (6,4) no eat, new head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // and tail (2,6) removed? Let's list.\n\nPrevious positions after turn 58: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\nTail is (2,6).\n\nMove to (6,4), no eat, so new head (6,4), body: previous head (6,5) becomes body, so [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]  // and tail (2,6) removed.\n\n(2,6) removed, so positions up to (1,6).\n\nHead at (6,4), direction Down.\n\nThen from (6,4), moves: U to (6,5) body, collision; D to (6,3) empty; L to (5,4) empty? (5,4) not in positions, so empty; R to (7,4) wall impossible.\n\nSo can move Down to (6,3) or Left to (5,4).\n\nThen I can choose.\n\nFor example, move Left to (5,4) at turn 60.\n\nBut (5,4) might be safe.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut it seems I can survive for a while.\n\nIn the Left path, if I move Left at 56, Down at 57 to (3,5), then at turn 58, I can move to (2,4) to eat or to (3,4).\n\nIf I move to (2,4) to eat, then head at (2,4), with body around, as before.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can move Up to (2,5) or Down to (2,3), as I said earlier.\n\nFor example, move Up to (2,5), then from (2,5), can move to (2,6) or (1,5) but (1,5) body, or (3,5) body, so only (2,6) if empty.\n\nAt that time, (2,6) might be vacated.\n\nBut it might be more constrained.\n\nTherefore, for better long-term survival, moving right to access the open area seems preferable.\n\nSo I think at turn 56, move Right.\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 58: D to (6,5) to eat\n\nThen at turn 59, from (6,5), I need to move, say to (5,5) or (6,4).\n\n(5,5) is empty, and moving Left might be better to go towards center.\n\nFrom (6,5), move Left to (5,5) at turn 59.\n\nThen as before, I must move Down to (5,4) at turn 60, then to (6,4) at turn 61, etc.\n\nBut at turn 59, after moving to (5,5), I have to move Down to (5,4), as no other choice.\n\nThen at (5,4), only Right to (6,4).\n\nThen at (6,4), I can move Down to (6,3) or Left to (5,4) but (5,4) is body now.\n\nAt (6,4), after moving from (5,4) to (6,4), head at (6,4), direction Right.\n\nThen moves: U to (6,5) body, D to (6,3), L to (5,4) body, R to (7,4) wall.\n\nSo only Down to (6,3).\n\nThen to (6,2), etc., down to the wall.\n\nBut I can turn left at some point.\n\nFor example, at (6,3), I can move Left to (5,3), but (5,3) might be body.\n\nLet's see positions at that point.\n\nAfter turn 61 move to (6,4), positions: let's not.\n\nTo avoid this, at turn 59, from (6,5), instead of Left, move Down to (6,4).\n\nThen at (6,4), I can move Left to (5,4) at turn 60.\n\n(5,4) is empty, as before.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move Down to (5,3) but (5,3) body, or Left to (4,4) body, or Up to (5,5) body, or Right to (6,4) body, all occupied except possibly Down, but (5,3) occupied.\n\nIn positions after turn 59 move to (6,4): head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(5,4) not occupied, so at turn 60, from (6,4) move Left to (5,4)\n\nNew head (5,4), no eat, tail (1,6) removed.\n\nPositions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nHead at (5,4), direction Left.\n\nThen moves: U to (5,5): (5,5) not occupied, empty\n\nD to (5,3): (5,3) body, occupied\n\nL to (4,4): (4,4) body, occupied\n\nR to (6,4): body, occupied\n\nSo only Up to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 61 move Up to (5,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can move to (5,5), then from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) but body, or (4,5) body, or (5,4) body, or (6,5) body, all occupied, so no move? U to (5,6) body, D to (5,4) body, L to (4,5) body, R to (6,5) body, all occupied, dead end.\n\nOh no, at (5,5), after moving up, positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n(5,5) is head, (5,4) is body, (6,4) body, (6,5) body, (5,6) body, etc., so all adjacent cells occupied, so no possible move, snake dies.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nTherefore, moving Down to (6,4) at turn 59 leads to a dead end later.\n\nIf I move Left to (5,5) at turn 59, from (6,5), then to (5,4) at turn 60, to (6,4) at turn 61, then to (6,3) at turn 62, and so on, down to (6,0) wall, but before that, I can turn left.\n\nFor example, at (6,3), I can move Left to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nAt turn 61, at (6,4), after moving from (5,4) to (6,4), positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nFrom (6,4), move Down to (6,3) at turn 62.\n\n(6,3) empty.\n\nThen head (6,3), direction Down.\n\nThen move Down to (6,2) at turn 63, and so on, to (6,0), but y=0 wall, so at (6,1), I can move Left to (5,1), but (5,1) might be wall or body.\n\n(3,1) is wall, but (5,1) not wall.\n\nBut body: at some point, (5,2) is body, so (5,1) might be free.\n\nBut it's risky.\n\nTo avoid this, after eating at (6,5), I should not go down immediately.\n\nBut from (6,5), I have only two choices: Down or Left.\n\nLeft leads to (5,5), which forces me down, then right, then down, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can move Down to (6,4), but then from (6,4), instead of moving Left to (5,4), I can move Down to (6,3) at turn 60.\n\nThen from (6,3), move Left to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, occupied, or Down to (6,2), etc.\n\nStill not good.\n\nThe problem is that the body blocks the center.\n\nFor long-term survival, it might be better to not eat the food at (6,5) immediately, but that might not be wise.\n\nAt turn 57 from (5,6), instead of moving Right to (6,6), I can move Down to (5,5).\n\nThen at turn 58, from (5,5) move Right to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction Right.\n\nThen from there, same as before.\n\nNo difference.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for the food yet.\n\nBut life span is 6, so I have time, but at turn 56, I need to move.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 56, move Right to (5,6), then at turn 57, move Down to (5,5).\n\nThen at turn 58, from (5,5), I can move to (5,4) or (6,5) to eat.\n\nIf I move to (6,5) to eat, same as before.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), then no eat, tail removed.\n\nBut (6,5) food is there, I should eat it.\n\nPerhaps the initial move Left is better for accessing the left side.\n\nLet's try the Left move sequence.\n\nTurn 56: move Left to (3,6)\n\nTurn 57: move Down to (3,5)  only choice\n\nTurn 58: move Left to (2,5) or Down to (3,4)\n\nIf I move to (2,5), then at turn 59, from (2,5) I can move Down to (2,4) to eat or Up to (2,6).\n\nSay move Down to (2,4) to eat at turn 59.\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction Down.\n\nThen from (2,4), move Up to (2,5) or Down to (2,3).\n\nSay move Down to (2,3) at turn 60.\n\n(2,3) empty, etc.\n\nThen I can move to (2,2) but (2,2) has food but occupied or will be vacated.\n\n(2,2) is body, but after some moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, after eating at (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(2,2) is body, so not free.\n\nWhen I move from (2,4) to (2,3) at turn 60, no eat, tail (1,6) removed, so positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n(2,2) still body.\n\nEventually, (2,2) will be tail or vacated.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nI think for the sake of decision, I'll go with the Right move to eat (6,5) and then try to maneuver.\n\nTo avoid the dead end, after eating at (6,5) at turn 58, at turn 59 move Down to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 60, from (6,4), move Left to (5,4).\n\nThen at turn 61, from (5,4), move Up to (5,5), as before.\n\nBut at (5,5), I am trapped, as all adjacent cells are occupied.\n\nPositions at turn 61 after moving to (5,5): head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nAdjacent: (5,6) body, (5,4) body, (4,5) body, (6,5) body, all occupied, no move, death.\n\nSo this path is bad.\n\nTherefore, I must not move to (5,5) or (5,4) in a way that boxes me in.\n\nAfter (6,4), at turn 60, instead of moving Left to (5,4), move Down to (6,3).\n\nThen at (6,3), move Down to (6,2), and so on.\n\nBut eventually down to wall.\n\nAt (6,2), I can move Left to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, occupied.\n\nIn positions, (5,2) is body, so not free.\n\nAt (6,1), move Left to (5,1), which might be free.\n\nBut it's risky.\n\nPerhaps the best is to not eat the food at (6,5) yet, but that seems wasteful.\n\nOr at turn 57, from (5,6), move Down to (5,5), then at turn 58, instead of eating, move to (5,4), then later eat.\n\nBut (6,5) food might be lost if not eaten soon, but life span 6, so at turn 56 to 61, I can eat at turn 61.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI think I should output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 56, move Right.\n\nThen turn 57, move Down to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 58, move Right to (6,5) to eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I have to accept the path and hope that as the tail moves, space opens up.\n\nFor example, after eating at (6,5), at turn 59 move Down to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 60 move Down to (6,3).\n\nThen at turn 61 move Down to (6,2).\n\nThen at turn 62 move Down to (6,1).\n\nThen at turn 63 move Down to (6,0) but y=0 wall, so at (6,1), I can move Left to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) not wall, not occupied yet.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can move to (5,0) wall or (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) is wall, so (4,1) might be free.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps the initial Left move is safer.\n\nLet's assume for turn 56, move Left to (3,6)\n\nTurn 57: move Down to (3,5)\n\nTurn 58: move Down to (3,4)\n\nThen at (3,4), I can move Left to (2,4) to eat at turn 59.\n\nTurn 59: move Left to (2,4) eat.\n\nThen from (2,4), at turn 60, move Down to (2,3) or Up to (2,5).\n\nSay move Down to (2,3).\n\nThen to (2,2) but (2,2) has food but occupied.\n\nAt turn 60, from (2,4) move Down to (2,3).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // after move no eat, tail removed.\n\n(2,2) is body.\n\nThen from (2,3), move Down to (2,2) to eat if possible.\n\nAt (2,2) there is food, and if I move to (2,2), I can eat it if it's exposed.\n\nAt turn 61, move Down to (2,2).\n\nIs (2,2) occupied? In positions, (2,2) is body, so if I move to it, collision, cannot.\n\nThe cell is occupied by body, so I can't move there.\n\nIt will be vacated later.\n\nFor example, when the tail moves away.\n\nBut at this point, it's not the tail.\n\nSo I cannot eat it yet.\n\nI think I should stop and decide.\n\nI'll go with the Right move and plan to eat the food.\n\nFor the sequence, I'll do:\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: R\n\nTurn 58: D  (eat at (6,5))\n\nThen for turn 59, move D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 60: move L to (5,4)  -- but earlier this led to trap, so perhaps move D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 60: D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 61: D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 62: D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 63: L to (5,1)  -- assuming (5,1) is free\n\nBut at that point, it might be ok.\n\nSince the food at (2,4) has long life, I can go for it later.\n\nBut for now, I'll output a sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: R\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D  -- to (6,1)\n\nThen at (6,1), move L to (5,1) at turn 63, but I need only 5+ turns, so up to turn 61 or so.\n\nThe current turn is 56, so think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 61 or 62.\n\nSo for answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: R\nTurn 57: R\nTurn 58: D\nTurn 59: D\nTurn 60: D\nTurn 61: D\n}\n\nFrom turn 56 to 61, that's 6 turns.\n\nTurn 56 action, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, so 6 actions.\n\nAnd at turn 61, I'm at (6,2) or something, and can continue.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 59 D to (6,4), turn 60 D to (6,3), turn 61 D to (6,2), then from there I can go to (6,1) etc.\n\nBut it should be survivable for now.\n\nTo make it better, after turn 58, at (6,5), move L to (5,5) at turn 59, then D to (5,4) at turn 60, then R to (6,4) at turn 61, then D to (6,3) at turn 62, etc.\n\nBut the trap happens later.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the strategy involves moving towards the food at (6,5) to eat it before its life span expires, while avoiding collisions and considering future moves. The food at (6,5) has a life span of 6, meaning it disappears after turn 61, so it should be eaten by turn 61. The food at (2,2) has a short life span (disappears after turn 58) but is currently under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately; attempting to reach it would be risky and inefficient given the snake's position and the available space. The food at (2,4) has a long life span (disappears after turn 64) and can be targeted later if feasible.\n\nThe snake starts at (4,6) with direction Up. Moving Up is impossible due to the wall at y=7, and moving Down is not allowed due to the no-instant-reverse rule. Thus, only Left or Right are possible. Moving Right to (5,6) is chosen to access the open area on the right and approach the food at (6,5). Moving Left would lead to a confined area with limited escape routes, increasing collision risk.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 56)**: Move Right to (5,6) to avoid walls and body collisions, and to position for reaching (6,5).\n- **Approaching Food (Turns 57-58)**: Move Right to (6,6) on turn 57, then Down to (6,5) on turn 58 to eat the food. This sequence avoids reversals and collisions.\n- **Post-Eating Maneuvers (Turns 59-61)**: After eating at (6,5), the head is at (6,5) with direction Down. Moving Up is impossible (reverse), so Down or Left are options. Moving Down to (6,4) on turn 59 is chosen to explore the bottom-right area, which has more space. Continuing Down to (6,3) and (6,2) on turns 60 and 61 avoids the body-packed center and leverages the open path along the right wall. This path is safe for at least 5 turns and can be extended by turning left (e.g., to (5,2) or (5,1)) when possible to avoid the y=0 wall.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: This sequence prioritizes eating available food (turn 58) while moving towards less crowded areas. The food at (2,4) can be considered later if the snake loops back, but the rightward path offers better expansion room. Risks like the internal wall at (3,1) are avoided.\n\n### Planned Sequence (5+ turns ahead, from turn 56 to turn 61):\n- Turn 56: Move Right (to (5,6)) – Accesses open space and avoids left confinement.\n- Turn 57: Move Right (to (6,6)) – Positions to eat (6,5) next turn.\n- Turn 58: Move Down (to (6,5)) – Eats food (+1 score, snake length increases).\n- Turn 59: Move Down (to (6,4)) – Explores downward; avoids immediate body collisions.\n- Turn 60: Move Down (to (6,3)) – Continues down safely; body is trailing.\n- Turn 61: Move Down (to (6,2)) – Nears the bottom wall but can turn left soon to survive.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one food item, avoids all collisions for 6 turns, and maintains flexibility for future moves. Beyond turn 61, the snake should turn left (e.g., to (5,2)) to avoid the y=0 wall and seek new food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: R\nTurn 57: R\nTurn 58: D\nTurn 59: D\nTurn 60: D\nTurn 61: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 57, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, or y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for y=0 to 7, (7,y) for y=0 to 7, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, (x,7) for x=0 to 7. So the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Internal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: head is at (5,6), and direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nSnake body: let's list the positions:\n\nHead: (5,6)\n\nThen (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nThe positions are given in order: head first, then body segments. So:\n\n- (5,6) head\n\n- (4,6) segment 1\n\n- (4,5) segment 2\n\n- (4,4) segment 3\n\n- (4,3) segment 4\n\n- (5,3) segment 5\n\n- (5,2) segment 6\n\n- (4,2) segment 7\n\n- (3,2) segment 8\n\n- (2,2) segment 9\n\n- (1,2) segment 10\n\n- (1,3) segment 11\n\n- (1,4) segment 12\n\n- (1,5) segment 13\n\n- (1,6) segment 14\n\n- (2,6) segment 15\n\n- (2,5) segment 16? Wait, the list has 17 positions? Let's count:\n\n[(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)] — that's 17 segments. So snake length is 17.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (2,2,2,1) — this is (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ) but here it's given as (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see.\n\nIt says: (2, 2, 2, 1) — probably (x=2, y=2, life_span=2, value=1)\n\nSimilarly, (6,5,5,1) — (6,5, life_span=5, value=1)\n\nAnd (2,4,8,1) — (2,4, life_span=8, value=1)\n\nAll have value 1, so all positive food? Value=1, and penalty for negative is -1, so yes, all positive food here.\n\nLife spans: for (2,2) it's 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 turns, including current turn? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 57, life_span=2, so it will be there for turns 57 and 58, and disappear at turn 59? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for food at (2,2) with life_span=2 at turn 57, it will be present at turn 57 (now), and turn 58, then disappear at turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) with life_span=5: present for turns 57,58,59,60,61, disappear at 62.\n\n(2,4) with life_span=8: present for turns 57 to 64, disappear at 65.\n\nAll value=1, so all good to eat.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,6), direction R (right). So from (5,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But current direction is R, so cannot instantly reverse to L, because \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So opposite of R is L, so cannot move left immediately.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6):\n\n- Up (U): to (5,7) — but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- Down (D): to (5,5) — is that valid? y=5, x=5, within 1-6, no wall? Walls are borders, so (5,5) should be playable, but internal obstacles? Only (3,1) is internal obstacle, so (5,5) is free? But need to check if occupied by snake body.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (5,6)\n\nBody: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is the last segment? Positions: from index 0: (5,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (2,2), 10: (1,2), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,6), 15: (2,6), 16: (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is position 16, which is the tail, I think. Since head is first, tail is last.\n\nNow, for moving to (5,5): is (5,5) occupied? Looking at positions: (5,6) head, (4,6), (4,5), etc. (5,5) is not in the list, so free? (4,5) is at index 2, which is (4,5), not (5,5). (5,3) is there, but not (5,5). So (5,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, down to (5,5): y=5, x=5, not wall, not snake body, so possible.\n\nLeft (L): to (4,6), but (4,6) is the first body segment. Moving to (4,6) would cause collision because head touches body? But rule: body collision except when moving into tail, since tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by the tail after the move, it's ok, because tail moves.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,5). When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away from its current position.\n\nIf head moves to (4,6), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, head would be at (4,6), but that segment was at (4,6), which will move to where? The segment at (4,6) will move to the next position, but since head is moving to (4,6), and the body segment at (4,6) will move to... let's simulate.\n\nBefore move: positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), etc.\n\nIf head moves left to (4,6), but (4,6) is currently occupied by a body segment. After the move, the new head position is (4,6), and the body segments shift: the segment that was at (4,6) moves to where? The positions update: new head is at (4,6), then the old head (5,6) becomes the new neck, but since head moved to (4,6), which was the position of the first body segment, so that segment is now covered.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, all segments shift forward. So the cell that was the tail is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that is not food, then the tail moves away, so the head can move to the previous position of the tail without collision, because tail leaves that cell.\n\nBut if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it will collide because after the move, that body segment is still there or something.\n\nRule: \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly, except when it's the tail and we're moving to it.\n\nSpecifically, moving to the tail cell is allowed because tail moves away.\n\nBut moving to a non-tail body cell is collision.\n\nIn this case, (4,6) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is (2,5).\n\nSo if head moves left to (4,6), which is occupied by a body segment, it should be a collision.\n\nSimilarly, right (R): to (6,6). x=6, y=6. Walls: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not wall? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is within 1 to 6, should be playable. Is (6,6) occupied? Snake positions: (5,6) head, (4,6), etc. (6,6) not listed, so free? But walls: y=6 is not wall, x=6 is not wall, since walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n\nx=6 is not a wall cell; walls are at x=0 and x=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls. Similarly for y. So (6,6) is a valid cell, not wall, and not occupied by snake, so moving right to (6,6) is possible.\n\nBut current direction is R, and moving right is same direction, so allowed.\n\nDown to (5,5) also possible.\n\nUp to (5,7): y=7 is wall, so invalid, death.\n\nLeft to (4,6): occupied by body segment, collision, death.\n\nSo possible moves: Right (R) to (6,6) or Down (D) to (5,5).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival and maximize score.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (2,2) with life_span=2, so must be eaten by turn 58 or it disappears. Turn 57 now, life_span=2, so after this turn, at turn 58, life_span=1, then at turn 59 it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 57 or 58.\n\n- (6,5) with life_span=5, can be eaten turns 57 to 61.\n\n- (2,4) with life_span=8, turns 57 to 64.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,6).\n\nIf I move right to (6,6), then from there, possible moves: U, D, L (since direction would be R, so can't move left? After moving right, new head direction is R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nFrom (6,6), possible:\n\n- Up to (6,7): y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down to (6,5): (6,5) is a food position! Value=1, life_span=5.\n\n- Left to (5,6): but (5,6) is currently the head, but after move, when head is at (6,6), (5,6) will be the first body segment? After moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), etc. (5,6) is now body segment.\n\nIf I move left from (6,6) to (5,6), which would be occupied by the body, so collision, unless it's the tail, but tail is far away.\n\nTail is at (2,5), so (5,6) is not tail, so moving left to (5,6) would be collision.\n\nSo from (6,6), possible moves: Down to (6,5) or... up to (6,7) invalid, left to (5,6) collision, right to (7,6) but x=7 wall, invalid. So only down to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has food, so if I move down to (6,5), I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nIf from (5,6) I move down to (5,5), then from (5,5), possible moves.\n\nFirst, let's consider the choices.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (6,6) at turn 57.\n\nThen from (6,6), only possible move is down to (6,5) at turn 58, eating the food there.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new positions: head to (6,5), and tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nCurrent positions before move turn 57: head (5,6), body segments down to tail (2,5).\n\nAfter moving right to (6,6): positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), ..., up to tail (2,5). Length still 17.\n\nThen move down to (6,5): since (6,5) has food, head moves to (6,5), eats food, so new head at (6,5), and tail does not move, so the body segments: the segment that was at (5,6) moves to where head was? Let's think.\n\nAfter first move to (6,6): positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5) ] — 18 positions? No.\n\nOriginal positions: 17 segments.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, the last segment (tail) is removed unless food eaten.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves, all segments shift, tail is removed.\n\n- If food, head moves, all segments shift, but tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, moving to (6,6): no food there, so head moves to (6,6), then the body: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,6), but since head was at (5,6), and it moves to (6,6), so the segment that was at (4,6) moves to (5,6), and so on, down to the tail: the segment that was at (2,5) is removed? Positions shift.\n\nInitial positions: index 0: (5,6) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (2,2), 10: (1,2), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,6), 15: (2,6), 16: (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving right to (6,6): new head at (6,6). Since no food, tail is removed. So new positions: head (6,6), then the segments shift: segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,6), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (4,6)? No.\n\nThe body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new position 0: (6,6) new head\n\nPosition 1: old position 0, which was (5,6)\n\nPosition 2: old position 1, (4,6)\n\nPosition 3: old position 2, (4,5)\n\n...\n\nUp to position 16: old position 15, (2,6)? Old positions: 0 to 16, 17 segments.\n\nAfter move, head new, then body: segment 1 to 16 are old segments 0 to 15.\n\nOld segment 0 was head at (5,6), becomes new segment 1 at (5,6)\n\nOld segment 1 at (4,6) becomes new segment 2 at (4,6)\n\n...\n\nOld segment 15 at (2,6) becomes new segment 16 at (2,6)\n\nOld segment 16 at (2,5) is not included, since tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nLength 17, same as before? No, removed tail, so from 17 to 16? I think I confused.\n\nInitial: 17 segments.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell with no food: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is discarded, so snake length decreases by 1? No, that can't be right.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard snake: when no food eaten, head moves to adjacent cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated, snake length remains the same.\n\nFor example, head at A, segment at B, tail at C.\n\nMove head to D (no food), then new head at D, segment that was at B moves to A, tail at C moves to B, and C is vacated. Snake still same length.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food cell, segments move, but tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions list: if no food, positions: new head position, then old head position, then old body positions except the last one is removed? Better to think indices.\n\nInitial positions: [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell Q:\n\n- If no food at Q, new positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}] — so length k, same as before? P0 to P_{k-1} is k elements, plus Q, so k+1 positions, but P_{k-1} is the new tail, and Pk is discarded.\n\nNumber of segments: initial k+1 segments? Indices from 0 to k, so k+1 segments.\n\nSet k = last index.\n\nInitial: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., P_m] with m+1 segments.\n\nFor example, here, 17 positions, indices 0 to 16, so 17 segments.\n\nAfter moving to Q with no food:\n\nNew head at Q, then new segment 1 at old P0, new segment 2 at old P1, ..., new segment m at old P_{m-1}, so new positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{m-1}] which has m+1 positions, but old had m+1, new has from Q to P_{m-1}, which is positions 0 to m, so m+1 positions, same number, but the last position is P_{m-1}, and P_m is discarded.\n\nIn this case, for snake, the length remains the same when no food eaten.\n\nWhen food eaten, new positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_m] , so length increases by one.\n\nBack to the move.\n\nAt turn 57, head at (5,6).\n\nIf move right to (6,6), no food there, so new positions: head (6,6), then old head (5,6), then old segment 1 (4,6), old segment 2 (4,5), ..., up to old segment 15 (2,6), and old tail (2,5) discarded.\n\nOld segments: 0: (5,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (2,2), 10: (1,2), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,6), 15: (2,6), 16: (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,6) no food: new head (6,6), then new segment 1: old 0 (5,6), new segment 2: old 1 (4,6), new segment 3: old 2 (4,5), new segment 4: old 3 (4,4), new segment 5: old 4 (4,3), new segment 6: old 5 (5,3), new segment 7: old 6 (5,2), new segment 8: old 7 (4,2), new segment 9: old 8 (3,2), new segment 10: old 9 (2,2), new segment 11: old 10 (1,2), new segment 12: old 11 (1,3), new segment 13: old 12 (1,4), new segment 14: old 13 (1,5), new segment 15: old 14 (1,6), new segment 16: old 15 (2,6)  -- and old 16 (2,5) discarded.\n\nSo new tail is at (2,6).\n\nNow, head at (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen at turn 58, from (6,6), possible moves: as before, only down to (6,5) because up wall, left collision, right wall.\n\nDown to (6,5), and (6,5) has food, so eat food.\n\nNew head at (6,5), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new positions: head (6,5), then old head (6,6), then new segment 1: old (6,6), new segment 2: old segment 1 (5,6), ..., up to new segment 17: old segment 16 (2,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position? When food eaten, the tail stays, so the body segments include the old tail.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) with food: new head at (6,5), then the previous head position (6,6) becomes new segment 1, then previous segment 1 (5,6) becomes new segment 2, ..., previous segment 16 (2,6) becomes new segment 17, and since food eaten, no segment removed, so new segment 18 at the previous tail position? No.\n\nPrevious positions before this move: head (6,6), segment 1 (5,6), segment 2 (4,6), ..., segment 16 (2,6)  -- 17 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5) with food: new head (6,5), then new segment 1 at old head position (6,6), new segment 2 at old segment 1 position (5,6), ..., new segment 17 at old segment 16 position (2,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so new segment 18 at the position where the tail was, but the tail was at (2,6), which is now occupied by segment 17, so new segment 18 at (2,6)? That can't be; it would be on the same cell.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move from its position, so a new segment is created at the tail position, extending the snake.\n\nSo after eating, the new tail is at the old tail position.\n\nIn this case, before move to (6,5), positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) ] -- 17 positions, tail at (2,6).\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) with food: new head at (6,5), then new segment 1 at (6,6) (old head), new segment 2 at (5,6) (old seg1), new segment 3 at (4,6) (old seg2), ..., new segment 17 at (2,6) (old seg16), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position (2,6), so new segment 18 at (2,6)? But that would be two segments at (2,6), which is wrong.\n\nMistake.\n\nThe old tail position is where the new segment is added, but after the body moves, the old tail position is vacated only if no food; if food, it is not vacated, and a new segment is placed there.\n\nBefore the move, the tail is at (2,6).\n\nWhen head moves to (6,5), the body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,6) moves to... no, the head moves, so the position (6,6) is now occupied by the new segment 1 (which was the old head).\n\nThe position (5,6) is occupied by new segment 2 (old segment 1), and so on.\n\nThe position that was the old tail (2,6) is now occupied by new segment 17 (old segment 16).\n\nThe old tail cell (2,6) is now empty because the segment moved to the previous position.\n\nThen, since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is (2,6), so new segment 18 at (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) was just vacated, so it's free.\n\nIn this case, new positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), and new tail at (2,6)? New segment 17: old seg16 at (2,6), and new segment 18 at old tail position, which is also (2,6), so both at (2,6)? That's collision.\n\nI think I double-counted.\n\nLet's simplify.\n\nInitial before move to (6,5): positions A = [H, S1, S2, ..., S16, T] with H=(6,6), T=(2,6)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5) with food eaten:\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- New segment 1: old H position (6,6)\n\n- New segment 2: old S1 position (5,6)\n\n- ...\n- New segment 17: old S16 position (2,6)  // S16 was the second last, at (2,6)\n\n- New segment 18: old T position (2,6)? But old T was at (2,6), which is now occupied by new segment 17.\n\nThe old T position is not a position to add; when food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new body includes the old tail.\n\nStandard: after eating, the snake has the same body plus the new head, so positions: [new head, old head, old S1, old S2, ..., old T] so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, new positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) ]  -- 18 positions, with tail at (2,6).\n\nOld T was at (2,6), and it is now the new tail at (2,6), with the new head at (6,5).\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nIf at turn 57 I move right to (6,6), then at turn 58 move down to (6,5) and eat food, so score +1, snake length 18 now.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction down (since moved D).\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,5): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction is D, so cannot move up (U) instantly.\n\nCurrent position: (6,5)\n\n- Up to (6,6): but (6,6) is now a body segment? After eating, positions include (6,6), which is segment 1, so occupied, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- Down to (6,4): y=4, not wall, not occupied? Let's see positions after eating: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), etc. (6,4) not in list, so free.\n\n- Left to (5,5): free? Not occupied.\n\n- Right to (7,5): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move up because it's opposite? Direction is D, so opposite is U, so cannot move up to (6,6) anyway, and it's occupied.\n\nSo possible: down to (6,4) or left to (5,5).\n\nNow, there is food at (2,4) and (2,2), but (2,2) has short life.\n\nBut from here, it might be far.\n\nFirst, let's consider the other option at turn 57.\n\nOption 2: at turn 57, move down to (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,6) move D to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) no food, so no growth.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then old head (5,6), then old segment 1 (4,6), old segment 2 (4,5), ..., up to old segment 15 (2,6), and old tail (2,5) discarded.\n\nOld positions: 0:(5,6), 1:(4,6), 2:(4,5), 3:(4,4), 4:(4,3), 5:(5,3), 6:(5,2), 7:(4,2), 8:(3,2), 9:(2,2), 10:(1,2), 11:(1,3), 12:(1,4), 13:(1,5), 14:(1,6), 15:(2,6), 16:(2,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no food: new head (5,5), new seg1: old 0 (5,6), new seg2: old 1 (4,6), new seg3: old 2 (4,5), new seg4: old 3 (4,4), new seg5: old 4 (4,3), new seg6: old 5 (5,3), new seg7: old 6 (5,2), new seg8: old 7 (4,2), new seg9: old 8 (3,2), new seg10: old 9 (2,2), new seg11: old 10 (1,2), new seg12: old 11 (1,3), new seg13: old 12 (1,4), new seg14: old 13 (1,5), new seg15: old 14 (1,6), new seg16: old 15 (2,6)  -- tail at (2,6)\n\nLength 17.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction D (down).\n\nNow possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction D, so cannot move up U.\n\n- Up to (5,6): occupied by new seg1, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n\n- Down to (5,4): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- Left to (4,5): free? Positions: (4,5) is new seg3, occupied.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (4,4), etc. So (4,5) is seg3, body, so moving left to (4,5) collision.\n\n- Right to (6,5): (6,5) has food, and not occupied by snake currently? In new positions, no (6,5), so free.\n\nAlso, (6,5) is food.\n\nSo from (5,5), possible moves: down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nMoving right to (6,5) would eat the food.\n\nIf move down to (5,4), no food, so just move.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,2) which has only 2 turns left.\n\nAt turn 57, life_span=2, so can be eaten on turn 57 or 58.\n\nBut snake head is at (5,6) or after move, far from (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is currently occupied by the snake! In initial positions, (2,2) is segment 9.\n\nAt turn 57, position (2,2) has food, but it is occupied by snake body.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:  \n1. The body moves away, and  \n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for (2,2), it is under the body, so to eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away from (2,2), then head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nIn this case, (2,2) is occupied by segment 9.\n\nTo eat it, the snake needs to have the body move away from (2,2), then head move to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is deep in the body, so it will take many moves for that segment to move away.\n\nMoreover, life_span is short.\n\nFor example, at turn 57, if the snake moves in a way that segment at (2,2) moves, but it will take several turns.\n\nLet's see the tail: tail is at (2,5), so when the snake moves, the tail will move first.\n\nBut (2,2) is not tail.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) will only move when the body shifts.\n\nFor instance, if the head moves away, after a few moves, the body at (2,2) will shift to the next position.\n\nBut it might be too late for the food life_span.\n\nSpecifically, food at (2,2) with life_span=2 at turn 57, so after turn 57, at turn 58, life_span=1, then after turn 58, it disappears, so only available on turn 57 and 58.\n\nBut on turn 57, (2,2) is occupied by body, so cannot eat it now.\n\nOn turn 58, if the body has moved away, and head moves to (2,2), it can be eaten.\n\nBut can the body move away by turn 58?\n\nCurrent turn 57, positions include (2,2) occupied.\n\nAfter turn 57 move, depending on action.\n\nFirst, if at turn 57 I move right to (6,6), as in option 1.\n\nAfter move, positions: head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (4,5), ..., and seg10 (2,2) is still there? After move to (6,6) no food, new positions: as above, new seg10 at old (2,2), which is position (2,2), still occupied.\n\nThen at turn 58, move to (6,5) and eat food, new positions include (2,2) as a body segment.\n\nAt turn 58, food at (2,2) has life_span=1, so still there, but occupied by snake body, so cannot eat.\n\nThen after turn 58, it disappears, so never eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 57 I move down to (5,5), after move, new positions have seg10 at (2,2), still occupied.\n\nAt turn 58, if I move, it might still be occupied or not.\n\nBut in both cases, by turn 58, (2,2) is likely still occupied, so cannot eat the food there before it disappears.\n\nFor example, the segment at (2,2) will only move when the snake moves enough for the body to shift.\n\nThe distance from head to that segment: in initial, (2,2) is segment 9, so 8 segments away from head.\n\nEach move, the body shifts, but the position (2,2) may be occupied until the tail moves past it.\n\nSince the tail is at (2,5), and the body is coiled, it might take time.\n\nSpecifically, to vacate (2,2), the segment that is there must move, which happens when the snake moves and that segment is not the last.\n\nBut with the current position, it might take several turns.\n\nFor instance, if the snake moves down or right, the tail is at (2,5) or (2,6), so (2,2) is not near tail, so it will stay occupied for a while.\n\nIn fact, in the new positions after turn 57 move down to (5,5), tail is at (2,6), and (2,2) is still occupied by seg10.\n\nThen at turn 58, if I move, say, to (6,5) or (5,4), the body shifts, seg10 moves to where seg9 was or something, but (2,2) might be vacated only if the segment there is the tail or something.\n\nLet's not waste time; it's clear that (2,2) cannot be vacated and eaten by turn 58, so the food at (2,2) will disappear without being eaten. So we can ignore it for scoring.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,4) has life_span=8, so plenty of time.\n\nFood at (6,5) can be eaten soon.\n\nNow, back to the choices.\n\nAt turn 57, I have two options: R to (6,6) or D to (5,5).\n\nIf I go R to (6,6), then I must go D to (6,5) at turn 58 and eat the food there, getting +1 score.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: as before, D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5), positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) -- and tail at (2,6)? Last is (2,6).\n\n(5,5) is not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) free.\n\nNow, if I move L to (5,5), or D to (6,4).\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,4) which is far.\n\nBut we need to think about survival and other food.\n\nIf I go D to (5,5) at turn 57.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go R to (6,5) to eat the food, or D to (5,4).\n\nIf I go R to (6,5) at turn 58, eat food, similar as above, but one turn later.\n\nLet's compare the sequences.\n\nFirst, sequence A: turn 57 R to (6,6), turn 58 D to (6,5) eat, score +1 at turn 58.\n\nThen at turn 59, from (6,5), direction D, can go L to (5,5) or D to (6,4).\n\n(5,5) is free, (6,4) free.\n\nIf go L to (5,5), then head at (5,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction L, so cannot move R instantly.\n\n- U to (5,6): occupied by body, collision.\n\n- D to (5,4): free\n\n- L to (4,5): may be occupied? Positions: after turn 59 move to (5,5), let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 58: head at (6,5), body as above.\n\nMove to (5,5) at turn 59: no food there, so move with no growth.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then old head (6,5), then old seg1 (6,6), old seg2 (5,6), etc., up to old seg17 (2,6) discarded? Positions: before move, 18 segments? After eating at turn 58, snake has 18 segments.\n\nAfter turn 58 eat at (6,5): positions 18 segments, tail at (2,6).\n\nAt turn 59, move to (5,5) no food: new head (5,5), then new seg1: old head (6,5), new seg2: old seg1 (6,6), new seg3: old seg2 (5,6), new seg4: old seg3 (4,6), and so on, down to new seg17: old seg16 (1,6), and old tail (2,6) discarded.\n\nNew tail at (1,6)? Old seg16 is at (1,6), which becomes new seg17.\n\nLength 18 to 17.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,6): occupied by new seg3? New positions: head (5,5), seg1 (6,5), seg2 (6,6), seg3 (5,6), etc. So (5,6) is seg3, body, collision.\n\n- D to (5,4): free\n\n- L to (4,5): free? Not occupied.\n\n- R to (6,5): occupied by seg1, collision.\n\nAnd cannot move R because opposite direction? Direction is L, opposite is R, so cannot move R anyway.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,4).\n\n(2,4) has food with life_span=8, so can be eaten later.\n\nAlso, after eating the food at (6,5), the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but we have to survive.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1), but not near now.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving towards the other food.\n\nBut first, let's decide the immediate action.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5) at turn 57, then from there I can move right to (6,5) at turn 58 to eat the food, getting +1 at turn 58, same as sequence A but the head position is different.\n\nIn sequence A, after turn 58, head at (6,5), in this case after turn 58, head at (6,5) too.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat the food at (6,5) by turn 58.\n\nIn sequence A: turn 57 R to (6,6), turn 58 D to (6,5) eat.\n\nIn sequence B: turn 57 D to (5,5), turn 58 R to (6,5) eat.\n\nBoth result in head at (6,5) at turn 58 with score +1.\n\nThen the subsequent moves are similar.\n\nBut in sequence A, after turn 57 move to (6,6), the body positions are different from sequence B.\n\nIn sequence A, after turn 57 move to (6,6) no food, positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\nThen turn 58 move to (6,5) eat: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail. 18 segments.\n\nIn sequence B: turn 57 move D to (5,5) no food: head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\nThen turn 58 move R to (6,5) eat: head (6,5), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail. 18 segments.\n\nThe body is different: in sequence A, after eating, the body has (6,6) and (5,6) close, while in sequence B, it has (5,5) and (5,6).\n\nBut both have head at (6,5) at turn 58.\n\nFrom there, the situation is similar.\n\nBut in sequence B, when at (5,5) turn 57, I could instead move down to (5,4) instead of eating immediately, but that might miss the food or delay.\n\nSince the food at (6,5) is there, and I can eat it, better to eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, in sequence A, I eat it at turn 58.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,4).\n\n(2,4) has food, and it is currently occupied by body? Initial positions: (1,4) is segment 12, (2,4) not listed, so free? Food at (2,4), value 1, life_span 8.\n\nIn snake positions, (2,4) not occupied, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut head is at (5,6) or after moves, at (6,5), which is far.\n\nDistance: from (6,5) to (2,4) is |6-2| + |5-4| = 4+1=5 moves away, but with the body, it might take more turns.\n\nLife_span 8, so enough time.\n\nBut we need to plan the path.\n\nThere is also the issue of the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut currently, tail is not near head.\n\nIn the positions, tail is at (2,5) or (2,6), head at (5,6) or (6,6), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moves, tail is at (2,6), head at (6,5), not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the available food and then move towards (2,4).\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is long, 17 segments, and the grid is 6x6 playable area, 36 cells, so snake occupies 17, many cells occupied.\n\nIn fact, with 18 after eating, even more.\n\nFree cells: total cells: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells.\n\nWalls: border not playable, but internal only (3,1) obstacle, so 36 - 1 = 35 playable cells.\n\nSnake 17, so 18 free cells initially? 35-17=18 free cells.\n\nAfter eating, 18 segments, 35-18=17 free.\n\nBut some have food.\n\nFood at (2,2), (6,5), (2,4), but (2,2) will disappear soon.\n\n(2,2) is occupied, so not free for head to move, but food is there.\n\nFree cells are those not occupied by snake or wall.\n\nFor movement, we care about accessible cells.\n\nPerhaps for now, since both options lead to eating the food at (6,5) by turn 58, I can choose either.\n\nBut let's see if one is better for survival or reaching other food.\n\nIn sequence A, after eating, head at (6,5), with body including (6,6) and (5,6) above.\n\nIf I move down to (6,4), or left to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is free in sequence A after turn 58.\n\nThen from there, I can move towards the left side where (2,4) is.\n\nSimilarly in sequence B.\n\nBut in sequence B, after turn 57 move to (5,5), if I don't eat at turn 58, I could move down to (5,4), but then the food at (6,5) might not be eaten, and I can eat it later, but life_span 5, so turns 57 to 61, so I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, at turn 57, move D to (5,5), then at turn 58, instead of moving R to (6,5), I could move D to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go to (5,3) or (4,4) or (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is occupied by body, etc.\n\nLet's list the occupied cells to avoid.\n\nPerhaps it's better to eat the food now to score and have flexibility.\n\nSince the grid is crowded, eating might make it harder to move, but not eating means the snake doesn't grow, which might be better for survival, but the goal is to maximize score, so eating positive food is good.\n\nBut survival is prioritized, so if eating leads to trap, avoid.\n\nBut here, after eating, I can still move.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), I can go to (6,4) or (5,5).\n\n(6,4) is bottom, y=4, then from there I can go left or down to (6,3), etc.\n\n(5,5) is more central.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,4), so moving left might be good.\n\nLet's plan a path to (2,4).\n\nFrom (6,5) to (2,4): I can go west then south, or south then west, but need to avoid body.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), move L to (5,5), then from (5,5), move L to (4,5), but (4,5) may be occupied.\n\nIn sequence A after turn 58: positions have (4,5) as a segment.\n\nIn the list: after eating, positions include (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nSpecifically, (4,5) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) might be free.\n\nFrom (6,5), move D to (6,4), then to (6,3), but (6,3) may be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 58 in sequence A: positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nSo occupied: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nFree cells: for example, (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) but (3,6) may be wall? Walls only border and (3,1), so (3,6) is playable, not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3), (2,4) has food, (2,5), (2,5) not occupied, free.\n\n(2,4) is free and has food.\n\n(3,3) free, (3,4) free, (3,5) free, (5,4) free, (5,5) free, (6,4) free, (6,3) free, (6,2) but y=2, free? (6,2) not occupied, not wall.\n\n(1,1) but (3,1) obstacle, (1,1) may be free.\n\nBut let's not list all.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move to (5,5) or (6,4).\n\nIf move to (5,5), then from (5,5), I can move to (4,5) but occupied, or (5,4) or (5,6) occupied, or (6,5) occupied.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6) occupied, D to (5,4) free, L to (4,5) occupied, R to (6,5) occupied. So only D to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to (5,3) occupied, or (4,4) occupied, or (6,4) free, or (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo only to (6,4) or possibly other.\n\n(5,4) to (6,4) or to (5,3) occupied, so only to (6,4) if I came from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), moves: U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) free. So only R to (6,4).\n\nThen from (6,4), similarly, U to (6,5) occupied, D to (6,3) free, L to (5,4) occupied, R to (7,4) wall. So only D to (6,3).\n\nAnd so on, I might be forced to go down to the bottom, which could be dangerous if I get trapped.\n\nIf from (6,5) I move directly to (6,4), then from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is free, as above.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to (5,3) occupied, or (4,4) occupied, or (5,5) occupied, or (6,4) occupied. So only if I move to (6,3) or something.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I move L to (5,4), then from (5,4), as above, only R to (6,4) or D to (5,3) occupied, so stuck? No, U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied or free? (6,4) is previous position, but after move, it's occupied by body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), the position (6,4) is now body segment.\n\nSo from (5,4), all adjacent may be occupied or wall.\n\nSpecifically, in the area, it might be tight.\n\nTo avoid this, it might be better to not eat the food at (6,5) immediately, so the snake doesn't grow, and I have more space.\n\nFor example, at turn 57, move D to (5,5), then at turn 58, instead of moving R to (6,5) to eat, move D to (5,4) to avoid eating for now.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to other places.\n\nLet's try.\n\nTurn 57: move D to (5,5) no food.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\nTurn 58: move D to (5,4) no food.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), then old head (5,5), old seg1 (5,6), old seg2 (4,6), ..., old seg15 (1,6), old tail (2,6) discarded.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (5,2), seg9 (4,2), seg10 (3,2), seg11 (2,2), seg12 (1,2), seg13 (1,3), seg14 (1,4), seg15 (1,5), seg16 (1,6) tail at (1,6).\n\nHead at (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) free.\n\nSo only R to (6,4).\n\nThen from (6,4), U to (6,5) has food, D to (6,3) free, L to (5,4) occupied, R to (7,4) wall. So can move U to (6,5) to eat, or D to (6,3).\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), eat food, then score +1, snake grows.\n\nOr move D to (6,3) no food.\n\nBut the food at (6,5) is still there for a few turns.\n\nSince I didn't eat it, I can eat it later.\n\nBut at (6,4), moving U to (6,5) is eating.\n\nOr I can go down.\n\nBut to reach (2,4), I need to go left.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I move D to (6,3), then from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3) or R wall.\n\n(5,3) is occupied in positions.\n\nAfter move to (6,3) no food, positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) tail.\n\nFrom (6,3), moves: U to (6,4) occupied, D to (6,2) free, L to (5,3) occupied, R wall. So only D to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), U to (6,3) occupied, D to (6,1) but y=1, free? (6,1) not wall, not occupied, so possible, or L to (5,2) occupied, R wall. So only D to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), U to (6,2) occupied, D to (6,0) wall, L to (5,1) free, R wall. So only L to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), and so on.\n\nI am forced to go down to the bottom, and it might be dead end or something.\n\nBut (3,1) is obstacle, so at (5,1), I can move to (4,1) or (5,2) occupied, etc.\n\nBut it's messy, and I might not be able to reach the other food.\n\nWhereas if I eat the food early, I can then try to move left.\n\nFor example, from (6,5) in sequence A, I move L to (5,5) at turn 59.\n\nThen from (5,5), only move D to (5,4) as earlier.\n\nThen from (5,4), only move R to (6,4).\n\nThen from (6,4), move D to (6,3), and so on, same as above.\n\nBut after eating, I have an extra segment, so it's tighter.\n\nIn the case where I didn't eat, I have one less segment, so more space.\n\nIn the move where I didn't eat, at turn 58 I moved to (5,4), then to (6,4), then I can from (6,4) move U to (6,5) to eat the food if I want, or continue down.\n\nBut from (6,4), moving U to (6,5) eats the food, so I can choose to eat it when I want, within life_span.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (2,4).\n\nFor example, from (6,4), instead of going down, I can go left, but (5,4) is occupied, so I have to go down first.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can only go D to (6,3) or U to (6,5) to eat.\n\nIf I go U to (6,5) eat, then I'm back to the situation with growth.\n\nBut if I go to (6,3), then I can only go down.\n\nAt (6,2), I can go L to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied.\n\nIn the positions when at (6,2), (5,2) is occupied, so only down to (6,1).\n\nThen at (6,1), go L to (5,1).\n\nThen at (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) occupied, D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1), or R to (6,1) occupied.\n\n(4,1) may be free or not.\n\nIn positions at that time, (4,1) might be free.\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then previous positions.\n\nBut it's complicated, and (3,1) is obstacle, so I can go to (4,1), then to (3,1) but obstacle, so to (2,1) or something.\n\nBut it's far from (2,4).\n\nPerhaps it's better to eat the food at (6,5) early and then try to navigate to the left.\n\nBut with the body, it's tight.\n\nNotice that the snake has many segments on the left and top, so the right-bottom is more free.\n\nFor example, cells like (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), etc., are free.\n\n(2,4) has food.\n\nFrom (6,5), if I could move left, but I can't directly.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 57, move D to (5,5), then at turn 58, move R to (6,5) to eat, getting to (6,5) same as before.\n\nThen from there, I can move D to (6,4), then to (6,3), but at (6,3), I can move L to (5,3) but occupied, so only down.\n\nBut at (6,2), if I move L to (5,2), occupied, so down to (6,1), then L to (5,1).\n\nAt (5,1), I can move L to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is free, not wall, not occupied.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) but occupied, D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) obstacle, R to (5,1) occupied. So stuck! No move.\n\nAt (4,1), all adjacent are invalid: U (4,2) occupied, D (4,0) wall, L (3,1) obstacle, R (5,1) occupied. So death.\n\nOh, so if I go down to the bottom, I get trapped at (4,1) or similar.\n\nTherefore, it is dangerous to go down; I should avoid that path.\n\nIn the case where I don't eat, I can at (6,4) move U to (6,5) to eat or not, but if I go down, I get trapped.\n\nSimilarly, after eating, if I go down, I also get trapped but with longer snake.\n\nSo to survive, I should not go down; I should stay in the upper area.\n\nBut how?\n\nFrom (6,5), I can only move to (5,5) or (6,4).\n\n(6,4) leads to trap, so I should move to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), only to (5,4), then to (6,4), then to (6,3), same path to trap.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can only move to (6,4), no choice.\n\nSo from (6,5), whatever I do, if I go to (5,5), then to (5,4), to (6,4), then to (6,3), etc., to death.\n\nIf I go directly to (6,4), same thing.\n\nSo the only way to avoid death is to not be in that position, or to have a different body configuration.\n\nBut in both sequences, after being at (6,5), I am forced to go down and die.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (6,5) leads to a trap.\n\nSo I should not eat it, or not go there.\n\nBut the food is there, and I can eat it, but it causes growth and then death.\n\nSo for long-term survival, I should avoid eating it or avoid going to (6,5).\n\nBut if I don't eat it, I can still move elsewhere.\n\nFor example, at turn 57, move D to (5,5), then at turn 58, move D to (5,4), then at turn 59, from (5,4) move R to (6,4), but from (6,4), I can move U to (6,5) to eat or not.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5) eat, then I'm at (6,5) with growth, then same problem.\n\nIf I don't eat, move D to (6,3), then I go down to death.\n\nSo to avoid death, I should not go to the right-bottom area at all.\n\nPerhaps at turn 57, instead of moving R or D, I have no choice, only R or D from (5,6).\n\nBut moving R leads to (6,6), then to (6,5), death.\n\nMoving D to (5,5), then I can choose not to go right.\n\nFor example, at turn 57 move D to (5,5), then at turn 58 move D to (5,4), then at turn 59 from (5,4) I can only move R to (6,4), but from (6,4), instead of moving U or D, I can move U to (6,5) but that eats or not, or D to (6,3).\n\nBut if I move D to (6,3), then to (6,2), etc., death.\n\nFrom (6,4), I have no other choice.\n\nUnless the body has moved, but in the positions, it's fixed.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the left earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 57 move D to (5,5), then at turn 58, instead of moving down, I have to move right or down, but down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5) eat, death later.\n\nIf I move down to (5,4), then to (6,4), then I can at turn 60 from (6,4) move U to (6,5) to eat, but same.\n\nBut let's see if I can go to (5,4) then to (5,3) but occupied, or to (4,4) occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother possibility: at turn 57, move R to (6,6), then at turn 58, I have to move D to (6,5) eat, then at turn 59, from (6,5) I can move L to (5,5), then to (5,4), same as before.\n\nSo in all cases, once I am at (6,5) or (6,6), I am forced to go down and die.\n\nTherefore, to survive, I should avoid going to the right at all.\n\nBut from (5,6), moving R or D are the only options, and both lead to the right area.\n\nMoving D to (5,5) is not right, but then I can go to (6,5).\n\nBut if I never go to (6,5), I can avoid the trap.\n\nFor example, at turn 57, move D to (5,5), then at turn 58, move D to (5,4), then at turn 59, from (5,4) move to (6,4), then at turn 60, from (6,4) move to (6,3), but that leads down.\n\nFrom (5,4), I have no choice but to move to (6,4).\n\nUnless I can move to other cells, but all other adjacent are occupied.\n\nSo it seems the only way is to not move down initially.\n\nBut at turn 57, from (5,6), I can only move R or D; L and U are invalid.\n\nR leads to death, D leads to death if I go to eat or down.\n\nBut if I move D to (5,5), and then I move in a way that I don't go to the right, but from (5,5), I can only move down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nIf I move down to (5,4), then I have to go right to (6,4), then down.\n\nSo I think the snake is trapped in the right-bottom corner.\n\nPerhaps I can use the food to grow and create space, but it seems difficult.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,4) can be eaten, and it's on the left.\n\nSo I should move left immediately, but I can't from (5,6).\n\nAt turn 57, move D to (5,5), then from (5,5), I can only move down or right, both bad.\n\nMove R to (6,6), then to (6,5), then I can only move left or down, both lead to death.\n\nSo perhaps the only way is to not eat the food at (6,5) and try to move left as soon as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,4) at turn 58, positions have the body shifted, so some cells might be free.\n\nAt turn 57 move D to (5,5): positions head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\nTurn 58 move D to (5,4): new head (5,4), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (5,2), seg9 (4,2), seg10 (3,2), seg11 (2,2), seg12 (1,2), seg13 (1,3), seg14 (1,4), seg15 (1,5), seg16 (1,6) tail.\n\nNow at (5,4), I can move R to (6,4) as before.\n\nBut (6,4) is free.\n\nThen at turn 59 move to (6,4): no food, so new positions: head (6,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (4,6), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (5,3), seg9 (5,2), seg10 (4,2), seg11 (3,2), seg12 (2,2), seg13 (1,2), seg14 (1,3), seg15 (1,4), seg16 (1,5) tail at (1,5)? Old seg15 (1,5) becomes new seg16, old tail (1,6) discarded.\n\nNew tail at (1,5).\n\nHead at (6,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen moves: U to (6,5) has food, D to (6,3) free, L to (5,4) occupied, R wall. So U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), I eat the food, then I am at (6,5) with growth, then same as before, forced down to death.\n\nIf I move D to (6,3), then to (6,2), etc., death.\n\nSo no good.\n\nFrom (6,4), I have to choose, but both bad.\n\nBut if I move U to (6,5) and eat, I die later; if I move D, I die sooner.\n\nSo perhaps eating gives a few more turns, but I die anyway.\n\nTo reach (2,4), I need to go left.\n\nFor example, from the position after turn 58, head at (5,4), if I could move left, but (4,4) is occupied.\n\nIn that position, (4,4) is seg5, occupied.\n\nLater, when the body moves, (4,4) might be vacated.\n\nFor example, after a few moves down, the tail moves, so the left side might free up.\n\nBut in the down path, I die before.\n\nPerhaps at turn 57, I move in a way that the body moves faster.\n\nI think it's hopeless; the snake is trapped.\n\nBut let's check the grid.\n\nPlayable area: x1-6, y1-6.\n\nWalls at borders and (3,1).\n\nSnake positions initial: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and top, with a loop at (5,3) to (5,2) to (4,2), etc.\n\nThe right side is relatively free: (6,y) for y=1-6 except possibly occupied.\n\n(6,5) has food, (6,6) free, etc.\n\nFrom (5,6), if I move R to (6,6), I am on the right edge.\n\nThen I have to go down to (6,5), then I am stuck.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then if I move R to (6,5), same thing.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4), I am lower.\n\nBut at (5,5), I can only move D or R.\n\nSo perhaps for survival, I should move D to (5,5) at turn 57, then at turn 58 move R to (6,5) to eat, score +1, and then accept that I will die soon, but since the food at (2,4) is far, I might not reach it, so +1 is better than 0.\n\nIf I don't eat, I can survive longer but no score.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating +1 is better than 0.\n\nThen after eating, I can have a few more moves before death.\n\nFor example, after eating at (6,5) at turn 58, at turn 59 move L to (5,5), turn 60 move D to (5,4), turn 61 move R to (6,4), turn 62 move D to (6,3), turn 63 move D to (6,2), turn 64 move D to (6,1), turn 65 move L to (5,1), turn 66 move L to (4,1), then at (4,1) stuck, die.\n\nSo I can survive until turn 66, but no more food eaten.\n\nFood at (2,4) has life_span=8, at turn 57, so at turn 65 it disappears, so I might reach it? From (4,1) to (2,4) is far, and I am trapped.\n\nSo no, I can't eat (2,4).\n\nSo only one food eaten.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,5), I can survive longer but no score.\n\nFor example, from turn 57 D to (5,5), turn 58 D to (5,4), turn 59 R to (6,4), turn 60 D to (6,3), turn 61 D to (6,2), turn 62 D to (6,1), turn 63 L to (5,1), turn 64 L to (4,1), then stuck at turn 65.\n\nSurvive to turn 65, no food eaten.\n\nSo score 0.\n\nWhereas if I eat, I have score +1 and survive to turn 66.\n\nBetter to eat.\n\nAlso, there might be a way to eat (2,4), but unlikely.\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, I can move in a way to unoccupy (2,2) but life_span short, not possible.\n\nSo for turn 57, I should move to eat the food.\n\nNow, which move: R to (6,6) or D to (5,5).\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), then at turn 58 I move D to (6,5) eat.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), then at turn 58 I can move R to (6,5) eat or D to (5,4).\n\nBut moving D to (5,4) delays eating or misses it.\n\nSo better to move R or D then eat.\n\nThe result is similar.\n\nBut in move R at turn 57, I go to (6,6), which is corner, then to (6,5).\n\nIn move D at turn 57, I go to (5,5), then to (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move directly to (6,5) without going to corner.\n\nBut (6,6) is not worse.\n\nSo I think either is fine.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAt turn 57, head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nIf I move D, I change direction to down.\n\nIf I move R, I keep direction.\n\nBut no big deal.\n\nPerhaps for the future, moving D to (5,5) allows me to go down, but as we saw, it leads to death.\n\nSo I think I should choose one.\n\nLet's say move R at turn 57 to (6,6), then D at turn 58 to (6,5) eat.\n\nThen for turn 59, from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4).\n\nAs per above, moving L to (5,5) then to (5,4), etc., or D to (6,4) then down.\n\nBut both lead to death, so I can choose arbitrarily.\n\nSince the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nBut the state is at turn 57, and I need to output actions for turn 57, 58, etc.\n\nBut I don't know how many turns, but at least for the immediate.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to move towards (2,4) after eating.\n\nBut from (6,5), I can't directly.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5), if I move L to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then from (5,4), I have to move R to (6,4), then from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or U to (6,5) occupied.\n\nIf I move D to (6,3), then I can at turn 62 from (6,3) move L to (5,3) but occupied, or D to (6,2).\n\nAt some point, the body might have moved, and (5,3) might be free.\n\nFor example, after a few moves down, the tail moves, so the left cells free up.\n\nBut in the down path, by the time I reach bottom, the left might be free, but I am trapped at bottom.\n\nFor instance, when I am at (6,1), the tail might be at (1,5) or something, so (2,4) is free, but I am far away.\n\nAnd I can't move up because the body blocks.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to reach (2,4).\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat the available food and then survive as long as possible.\n\nSo at turn 57, move R to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 58, move D to (6,5) and eat.\n\nThen for turn 59, I can move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4).\n\nLet's choose L to (5,5) to stay higher.\n\nThen turn 60, from (5,5) move D to (5,4).\n\nTurn 61, from (5,4) move R to (6,4).\n\nTurn 62, from (6,4) move D to (6,3).\n\nTurn 63, from (6,3) move D to (6,2).\n\nTurn 64, from (6,2) move D to (6,1).\n\nTurn 65, from (6,1) move L to (5,1).\n\nTurn 66, from (5,1) move L to (4,1).\n\nThen at (4,1), no move, die.\n\nBut turn 66 is many turns ahead.\n\nSince the food at (2,4) disappears at turn 65 (life_span=8 at turn 57, so after 8 turns, turn 65 it disappears, so on turn 64 it can be eaten if available, but it's not.\n\nLife_span=8 at turn 57, so present on turns 57 to 64, disappear at turn 65.\n\nBut I can't reach it.\n\nSo only one food eaten.\n\nIf I don't eat, no food, worse.\n\nSo I think moving to eat is better.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSo for turn 57: R\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nThen for turn 59, say L to (5,5)\n\nBut I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nSince the grid is small, and I will die, but for the format, I can provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 57, move D to (5,5), then at turn 58, move D to (5,4), then at turn 59, from (5,4) move to (6,4), then at turn 60, from (6,4) move U to (6,5) to eat the food, then at (6,5) same as before.\n\nBut I eat later, at turn 60, and the food life_span=5 at turn 57, so at turn 60, life_span=2, so still available, then I eat, score +1, then same death later.\n\nBut I survive longer without growth, so more turns, but no additional score.\n\nFor example, turn 57 D to (5,5), turn 58 D to (5,4), turn 59 R to (6,4), turn 60 U to (6,5) eat, then turn 61 L to (5,5), turn 62 D to (5,4), turn 63 R to (6,4), turn 64 D to (6,3), turn 65 D to (6,2), turn 66 D to (6,1), turn 67 L to (5,1), turn 68 L to (4,1), die at turn 69.\n\nSurvive longer, but still only one food.\n\nBetter to eat earlier to have the score sooner.\n\nBut since the score is the same, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the first case, I eat at turn 58, in this case at turn 60.\n\nBut for the snake, it's similar.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll go with moving right at turn 57.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 57: R\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nThen for turn 59, I need to choose, say L.\n\nBut let's provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nThe instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the turns.\n\nIn answer format, \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list for a few turns.\n\nSince I will die, I can list until I can.\n\nBut for now, for turn 57 and 58.\n\nThen for turn 59, from (6,5), I can move L or D.\n\nLet's move L to (5,5) to try to go left.\n\nThen turn 60 D to (5,4), turn 61 R to (6,4), turn 62 D to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can provide:\n\nTurn 57: R\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nThen it's up to the game.\n\nBut to be complete, let's say for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 59: L\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: R\n\nBut from (5,5) to (5,4) is D, then to (6,4) is R.\n\netc.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I must carefully plan the snake's movements over at least 5 turns, considering the current state and potential future risks. The key constraints and opportunities are:\n\n- **Current Position and Direction**: Snake head at (5,6), moving right (R). Only valid moves are right (R) to (6,6) or down (D) to (5,5), as up (U) hits a wall and left (L) causes body collision.\n- **Food Availability**:\n  - (2,2): Value +1, life_span 2 (disappears after turn 58). Currently under snake body (segment 9), so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it by turn 58. Given the distance and body occupation, this is unlikely and risky to attempt.\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life_span 5 (disappears after turn 61). Accessible and can be eaten soon for +1 score.\n  - (2,4): Value +1, life_span 8 (disappears after turn 64). Far from the head but can be targeted later for additional score.\n- **Risks**:\n  - The snake is long (17 segments) in a 6x6 playable grid (36 cells minus 1 internal obstacle and snake occupancy), leaving limited space. Growing by eating may increase collision risk.\n  - Moving into the bottom-right corner (e.g., (6,5)) risks trapping the snake, as subsequent moves may force a path downward toward dead ends (e.g., (4,1) is a potential trap).\n  - Eating (6,5) is feasible and provides immediate score, but must be done carefully to avoid immediate traps.\n- **Survival Priority**: Avoid the bottom-right trap by not lingering there. After eating (6,5), move left/up if possible to access open areas near (2,4). However, the body configuration limits options, and (2,4) may not be reachable before death. Focus on eating (6,5) for +1 score and maximizing turns survived.\n\n### Decision for Turns 57-61\n- **Turn 57 (t=57)**: Move right (R) to (6,6). This avoids moving down immediately and positions the head to eat (6,5) next turn. Moving down (D) to (5,5) is possible but delays eating and offers no advantage.\n- **Turn 58 (t=58)**: Move down (D) to (6,5) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length 18). Life_span of (6,5) is 5 at t=57, so it is still available. Eating now ensures the score.\n- **Turn 59 (t=59)**: From (6,5), direction is down (D). Valid moves are left (L) to (5,5) or down (D) to (6,4). Moving left (L) is chosen to avoid the downward trap and stay in less constrained areas. (5,5) is free at this stage.\n- **Turn 60 (t=60)**: From (5,5), direction is left (L). Only valid move is down (D) to (5,4), as up (U) to (5,6) causes collision, left (L) to (4,5) causes collision, and right (R) is invalid (opposite direction).\n- **Turn 61 (t=61)**: From (5,4), direction is down (D). Only valid move is right (R) to (6,4), as other directions cause collisions or are invalid.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond 5 Turns)\n- After turn 61, the snake is forced downward: to (6,4) at t=61, then likely to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and finally (5,1) before getting trapped at (4,1) around turn 66-68. Death is inevitable due to the body blocking all escapes, but this sequence maximizes survival turns after scoring.\n- (2,4) food is too far and risky to reach with the current body; attempting it could shorten survival. (2,2) food disappears uneaten by turn 59 due to body occupation.\n- Score: +1 from eating (6,5). No other food can be safely eaten, so focus on survival after scoring.\n\n### Answer\nThe actions prioritize eating (6,5) for immediate score and then avoiding the bottom-right trap as long as possible.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 58: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 59: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 60: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 61: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 7 units wide and tall, but cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). That's 17 segments. Let me count: positions list has 17 elements, so snake length is 17.\n\nHead direction is R, meaning right, so last move was to the right, to (6,6). Since head is at (6,6) and direction is R, it came from left, so previous head was (5,6), which matches the second position.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (2,2) with value 1, life span 1. Value 1 is positive food? It says value1=1, and in the description, positive food has value +1, negative has -1. Here it says \"value1, life_span1\" for each, so (2,2,1,1) means position (2,2), value=1, life_span=1. Similarly, (6,5,4,1) might be (x,y,value,life_span) or (x,y,life_span,value)? Let's see the input format.\n\nIt says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for (2,2,1,1), it's (x,y) = (2,2), value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5,4,1): (6,5), value=4? But in the core rules, food values are +1 or -1, but here it says value=4? That can't be right. Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\". But here, for (6,5,4,1), value=4? That doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 2, 1, 1)\" – it says \"Life Span and Value\" but in the list it's written as (x,y, life_span, value)? No.\n\nThe text says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nBut in the list, it's given as (2, 2, 1, 1) which might be ambiguous. Let's see the punctuation.\n\nIt says: \"(2, 2, 1, 1)\" and then \"(6, 5, 4, 1)\" etc. But according to the format, it should be ( (x,y), value, life_span ). So for (2,2,1,1), it's probably (x,y)=(2,2), value=1, life_span=1. But value=1 is consistent with +1 for positive.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5,4,1): (x,y)=(6,5), value=4? But value should be +1 or -1, not 4. That can't be.\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's check the last one: (1,5,10,1) – life_span=10, value=1?\n\nBut in the description, it says \"value1, life_span1\" in the tuple, so for (2,2,1,1), value=1, life_span=1; for (6,5,4,1), value=4, life_span=1; but value=4 is not +1 or -1. That seems odd.\n\nMaybe it's a typo or I misread the input. Let me read the state again.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n- (2, 2, 1, 1)\n- (6, 5, 4, 1)\n- (2, 4, 7, 1)\n- (1, 5, 10, 1)\"\n\nAnd it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so (2,2,1,1) should be x=2,y=2, value=1, life_span=1. Similarly, (6,5,4,1) x=6,y=5, value=4, life_span=1.\n\nBut value=4 for positive food? That contradicts the core rules. Perhaps in this game, food can have different values, but the core rules say positive is +1, negative is -1. Let me check the core rules.\n\n\"Core Rules 1. Food Mechanics - Positive Food - Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1 - Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1 | Length of snake unchanged\"\n\nIt doesn't say values can be other than +1 or -1. But here we have value=4 for (6,5), which is not +1 or -1. Similarly, (2,4,7,1) value=7? That can't be.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake in the input or my reading. Let's see the punctuation: \" (2, 2, 1, 1) \" – it might be that it's listed as (x,y, life_span, value) or something. But the format says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \", so the first two numbers are x and y, then value, then life_span.\n\nBut for (6,5,4,1), if x=6,y=5, value=4, life_span=1, but value=4 is not standard.\n\nAnother possibility: the \"1\" in \"1,1\" for (2,2) is value=1, life_span=1, similarly for others. But for (6,5,4,1), value=4, life_span=1; (2,4,7,1) value=7, life_span=1; (1,5,10,1) value=10, life_span=1. But the core rules only mention +1 and -1 for values.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps I should assume that the values are as given, so positive food can have different reward values? But the core rules don't say that.\n\nLet me read the core rules carefully: \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, \"-1\" for negative. But in the state, it's given with different values. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem.\n\nPerhaps the tuple is (x,y, value, life_span), and for (2,2,1,1) value=1, which is fine, but for (6,5,4,1) value=4, which is unusual.\n\nMaybe \"4\" is a typo, or it's life_span. Let's look at the last one: (1,5,10,1) – if value=10, life_span=1, or value=1, life_span=10?\n\nThe format is \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\", so for (1,5,10,1), it should be (x,y)=(1,5), value=10, life_span=1.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense with the rules. Unless the rules are simplified, and in this instance, food can have different values.\n\nPerhaps in this game, the value indicates the reward, so for (6,5), eating it gives +4 score and increases length by 1, similarly for others.\n\nI think I have to go with the state as given. So for food:\n\n- (2,2): value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (6,5): value=4, life_span=1\n\n- (2,4): value=7, life_span=1? Wait, (2,4,7,1) – value=7, life_span=1\n\n- (1,5): value=10, life_span=1? (1,5,10,1) – value=10, life_span=1\n\nBut life_span=1 for all? That can't be right. Life_span for (2,2) is 1, (6,5) is 1, but (2,4) has 7,1? (2,4,7,1) – if value=7, life_span=1, or is it value=1, life_span=7?\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the notation.\n\nLet's read the state input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nThen listed as: (2, 2, 1, 1) – so it's (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? The text says \"value1, life_span1\" so it should be value then life_span.\n\nBut for (2,2,1,1), value=1, life_span=1\n\n(6,5,4,1): value=4, life_span=1\n\n(2,4,7,1): value=7, life_span=1\n\n(1,5,10,1): value=10, life_span=1\n\nAll have life_span=1, so they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nLife_span is the number of turns it remains, including current turn, so if life_span=1, it disappears after this turn, so it must be eaten now or not at all.\n\nSimilarly for all food, life_span=1, so they are all expiring this turn.\n\nBut value=4,7,10, which are not +1, but I think I have to accept that in this game, food can have different values.\n\nPerhaps the value is the score reward, and for positive food, length increases by 1, regardless of value, but the score increases by the value.\n\nThe core rules say for positive food, reward value +1 and length +1, but here values are different, so I'll assume that eating food gives score equal to value and increases length by 1 for positive values, but all values are positive here, since 1,4,7,10 all >0.\n\n(2,2,1,1) value=1, (6,5,4,1) value=4, etc. No negative food mentioned.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake.\n\nNow, current turn t1=58.\n\nSnake head at (6,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot reverse instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left), because that would be opposite. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n\nNow, grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: list of 17 cells.\n\nFood at:\n- (2,2) value=1, life_span=1\n- (6,5) value=4, life_span=1\n- (2,4) value=7, life_span=1? (2,4,7,1) – value=7, life_span=1\n- (1,5) value=10, life_span=1? (1,5,10,1) – value=10, life_span=1\n\nAll life_span=1, so if not eaten this turn, they disappear.\n\nSo we must consider eating one of them this turn.\n\nBut we need to think 5+ turns ahead for long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nDraw a 6x6 grid, from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nWalls: border cells are walls, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are out of bound. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\nHead: (6,6)\nThen: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nList the positions in order:\n\n1. (6,6) head\n\n2. (5,6)\n\n3. (4,6)\n\n4. (4,5)\n\n5. (4,4)\n\n6. (4,3)\n\n7. (5,3)\n\n8. (5,2)\n\n9. (4,2)\n\n10. (3,2)\n\n11. (2,2)\n\n12. (1,2)\n\n13. (1,3)\n\n14. (1,4)\n\n15. (1,5)\n\n16. (1,6)\n\n17. (2,6) tail\n\nTail is at (2,6).\n\nFood at:\n- (2,2) but (2,2) is occupied by the snake! Position 11 is (2,2), so there is food at (2,2) which is under the snake body.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) has food, but position 15 is (1,5), so food at (1,5) is under the snake body.\n\nFood at (2,2) and (1,5) are under the snake body.\n\nFood at (6,5) and (2,4) are not occupied by snake, I think.\n\n(2,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: (1,4) is position 14, (1,5) is 15, no (2,4) in snake positions, so (2,4) is free.\n\n(6,5): not in snake positions, head is (6,6), (5,6) is body, no (6,5), so free.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by snake at position 11.\n\n(1,5) is occupied by snake at position 15.\n\nFor food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSince life_span=1 for all, they must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\nBut to eat food under body, we need the body to move away this turn, so that the cell is free, and then head moves to it next turn or something? No.\n\nThe rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nThis must happen in the same turn? Or over time?\n\nTypically, in one turn: when the snake moves, the body moves, so if the body segment that was on the food moves away, and simultaneously, the head moves to that cell, but that might not be possible because the head moves to a new cell, and the body shifts.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt the start of turn, food is at (2,2), which is occupied by body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, say we choose a direction, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo, for example, if the snake moves, the segment at (2,2) will move to where the previous segment was, which is (1,2) or something, depending on the move.\n\nLet's see the current positions.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nAfter move, if head moves to (7,6) but x=7 is wall, so not possible. Head can only move to (6,5), (6,7) invalid, (5,6) is body, (7,6) wall. So possible head moves: from (6,6), R is (7,6) wall, not possible; L to (5,6) but (5,6) is the second segment, so collision if it moves there? No, because when it moves, the body also moves.\n\nStandard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is cut off or something? No, in this case, when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nBut if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nFor food under body: suppose a body segment is on a food cell. When the snake moves, that body segment will move to a new position, so the food cell is vacated, but only if that segment was the one on it and it moves away.\n\nThen, if the head moves to that vacated cell in the same move, it can eat the food.\n\nIn one turn: when the snake moves, the cell that was occupied by a body segment might become free if that segment moves away, and if the head moves to that cell, it can eat the food there.\n\nFor example, food at (2,2): currently occupied by the 11th segment at (2,2).\n\nIf the snake moves in such a way that the segment at (2,2) moves to a different position, then (2,2) is vacated, and if the head moves to (2,2), it can eat the food.\n\nBut the head is at (6,6), which is far away, so it can't move to (2,2) in one move. So impossible to eat food at (2,2) this turn, because the head can't reach it in one step.\n\nSimilarly for (1,5): occupied by 15th segment.\n\nHead at (6,6), can only move to adjacent cells: (6,5), (5,6), or (6,7) invalid, (7,6) invalid. So only (6,5) down or (5,6) left, but (5,6) is body, so moving left to (5,6) would cause collision unless it's the tail, but (5,6) is not tail, it's the second segment.\n\nMoving to a cell occupied by body is deadly, except for the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, for a move, if head moves to a cell that is not tail and occupied by body, collision. If it moves to tail cell, and tail moves, no collision.\n\nIn this case, from (6,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,7) y=7 is wall, invalid\n\n- D: (6,5) – is this occupied? Snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), etc, no (6,5), so (6,5) is free, and there is food there with value=4.\n\n- L: (5,6) – which is the second segment, not tail, so if head moves to (5,6), it would collide with body, deadly.\n\n- R: (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,5), which has food with value=4.\n\nWe can also consider moving to tail, but tail is at (2,6), far away.\n\nSo only one possible move: down to (6,5).\n\nIs that right?\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R, so cannot move L (reverse), but moving L is to (5,6), which is body, so not allowed anyway.\n\nU is wall, R is wall, L is body or reverse, so only D is possible.\n\nD to (6,5) is free and has food.\n\n(6,5) has food with value=4, life_span=1.\n\nSo if we move down, head to (6,5), which is food, so we eat it, score +4, length increases by 1.\n\nThen, since we ate food, the tail does not move, so new tail is still at (2,6), and we add a new segment, so snake becomes longer.\n\nPositions after move: head to (6,5), then the previous head (6,6) becomes the new second segment, and so on, down to the tail which stays because we ate food.\n\nCurrent positions before move: indices from head to tail: 0: (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,2), 8: (4,2), 9: (3,2), 10: (2,2), 11: (1,2), 12: (1,3), 13: (1,4), 14: (1,5), 15: (1,6), 16: (2,6) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (6,5) and eating food: head moves to (6,5), which is food, so we eat it, tail remains, so the new positions: head at (6,5), then the old head (6,6) becomes segment 1, then old segment 1 (5,6) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to old segment 16 (2,6) which is still tail, but since we ate food, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was? No.\n\nStandard: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n\nSo new positions: head at (6,5), then old head (6,6) is now body, then old segment 1 (5,6) is now body, ..., all the way to old tail (2,6) which is still there, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so the tail becomes the new position? Let's think.\n\nTypically: the head moves to new position. If no eat, tail is removed. If eat, tail is not removed, so length increases.\n\nSo after move: positions: head at new position (6,5), then the previous positions from 0 to 16 all remain, but shifted: the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1, but for i from 1 to 16, segment i moves to where segment i-1 was, but segment 0 moves to new head position.\n\nBetter: the new body segments are: the old head position becomes the new segment 1, old segment 1 becomes new segment 2, ..., old segment 15 becomes new segment 16, old segment 16 (tail) becomes new segment 17, and since we ate food, no tail removal, so new length 18, with tail at old tail position (2,6).\n\nNew positions:\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (6,6)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 (5,6)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 (4,6)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 7: old segment 6 (5,3)\n\n- New segment 8: old segment 7 (5,2)\n\n- New segment 9: old segment 8 (4,2)\n\n- New segment 10: old segment 9 (3,2)\n\n- New segment 11: old segment 10 (2,2)\n\n- New segment 12: old segment 11 (1,2)\n\n- New segment 13: old segment 12 (1,3)\n\n- New segment 14: old segment 13 (1,4)\n\n- New segment 15: old segment 14 (1,5)\n\n- New segment 16: old segment 15 (1,6)\n\n- New segment 17: old segment 16 (2,6)  // this is the new tail\n\nSince we ate, tail stays and we have one more segment.\n\nNow, the food at (6,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (2,2) and (1,5) are under body, but since we moved, the segments have shifted.\n\nOld (2,2) was segment 10, which is now at new segment 11 position? After move, new segment 11 is at old (2,2), but the food was there, but since the body moved to it? I'm confused.\n\nBefore move, food at (2,2) is under body segment at (2,2).\n\nAfter the snake moves, the segment that was at (2,2) moves to a new position. In this case, since the head moved down, the body shifts.\n\nThe segment that was at (2,2) was segment 10 (index from 0), which was at (2,2). After move, since the snake moved down, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSpecifically, segment 10 (at (2,2)) will move to where segment 9 was, which is (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, segment 11 (at (1,2)) moves to where segment 10 was, (2,2), and so on.\n\nIn general, for a body segment at position i, after move, it moves to the position that was occupied by segment i-1 before the move.\n\nBefore move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P16.\n\nAfter move: head to new position, say H_new.\n\nThen new position 0: H_new\n\nNew position 1: P0 (old head)\n\nNew position 2: P1 (old seg1)\n\n...\n\nNew position k: P_{k-1} for k from 1 to 16\n\nNew position 17: P16 (old tail, but since ate, it stays)\n\nFor the cell (2,2): before move, it was occupied by segment 10 at P10=(2,2)\n\nAfter move, segment 10 moves to new position, which is P9, which was (3,2), so segment 10 is now at (3,2)\n\nThe cell (2,2) is now occupied by who? After move, new segment 11 is at P10, which was (2,2), so new segment 11 is at (2,2)\n\nBut before move, there was food at (2,2), which was under body. After move, the body segment that was there moved away to (3,2), and the cell (2,2) is now occupied by new segment 11, which moved from (1,2) to (2,2). So the food is still under a body segment, but a different one. Since the head didn't move to (2,2), it wasn't eaten. And since life_span=1, it disappears after this turn, so lost.\n\nSimilarly for (1,5): before move, segment 14 at (1,5) with food.\n\nAfter move, segment 14 moves to P13, which was (1,4), and new segment 15 is at P14, which was (1,5), so food still under body, not eaten.\n\nFood at (2,4) was free, but not eaten since head not there.\n\nBut in this move, we ate (6,5), so it's gone.\n\nNow, after this move, the food all disappear since life_span=1 and not eaten.\n\n(2,2) and (1,5) were not eaten, and (6,5) eaten, (2,4) not eaten.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is free, but head not there, so not eaten, disappears.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo after turn 58, all food gone, we have eaten one food with value 4.\n\nBut we need to plan for future turns.\n\nNow, after moving down to (6,5), head is now at (6,5), and direction was R, but we moved D, so new head direction is D (down).\n\nSnake positions: as above, head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nNew segment 17 is (2,6), tail.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders, obstacle at (3,1).\n\nPossible moves from (6,5): U to (6,6), which is body, segment 1, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nD to (6,4), which should be free? Let's see occupied cells.\n\nCurrent positions: (6,5) head, (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nSo cells occupied: all these.\n\n(6,4) not in list, so free.\n\nL to (5,5)? (5,5) not in positions, should be free.\n\nR to (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,6): occupied by body, segment 1, not tail, so deadly collision.\n\n- D to (6,4): free, no issue\n\n- L to (5,5): free, no issue\n\n- R to (7,5): wall, invalid\n\nAlso, current direction is now D (since we just moved down), so we cannot move up (U) because reverse? Direction constraint: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction after move is down, so we cannot move up on the next turn.\n\nSo for turn t1+1=59, from head (6,5), direction D, so cannot move U (up), because opposite.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R. But R is invalid, so only D or L.\n\nD to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nWe need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nBut currently no food, so we need to survive and wait for new food or something, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so perhaps we assume no new food for now, or we need to explore.\n\nThe problem is to maximize score, so we should try to eat food when available, but now all food gone, so for future, we need to stay alive and eat when possible.\n\nBut we must output actions for multiple turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many turns? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output should be for a sequence, I think we need to provide actions for the next few turns, probably until a decision point or something.\n\nSince no immediate food, we can plan a path.\n\nFirst, at turn t1=58, we must move, and only possible move is down to (6,5) to eat the food.\n\nSo for turn 58, action is D.\n\nThen for turn 59, head at (6,5), direction D, possible moves: D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nNow, let's see the grid and snake.\n\nWe need to avoid dead ends and plan for long survival.\n\nThe snake is long, 18 segments now.\n\nAvailable space: grid 6x6, but walls and obstacles.\n\nCells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6.\n\nOccupied: snake positions, and obstacle at (3,1).\n\nFree cells: total 36 cells, minus 18 snake, minus 1 obstacle, so 17 free cells.\n\nBut many are scattered.\n\nList free cells:\n\nFor y=6: (3,6), (6,6) occupied but (6,6) is body, (1,6) occupied, (2,6) tail, (4,6) occupied, (5,6) occupied, (6,6) occupied, so (3,6) free.\n\ny=5: (1,5) occupied, (2,5)? Not occupied, (3,5)? Not, (4,5) occupied, (5,5) free, (6,5) head.\n\n(6,5) is head, so free except that.\n\nList all cells:\n\nRow y=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) obstacle, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nBut snake: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), etc, no y=1 except obstacle, so (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) free, but (3,1) obstacle.\n\ny=2: (1,2) occupied, (2,2) occupied, (3,2) occupied, (4,2) occupied, (5,2) occupied, (6,2)? Not in list, free.\n\ny=3: (1,3) occupied, (2,3)? Not, (3,3)? Not, (4,3) occupied, (5,3) occupied, (6,3)? Not\n\ny=4: (1,4) occupied, (2,4)? Free, (3,4)? Not, (4,4) occupied, (5,4)? Not, (6,4) free\n\ny=5: (1,5) occupied, (2,5)? Free, (3,5)?

From (5,4) to (6,4) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), but (6,5) is body, deadly.\n\nD to (6,3), free.\n\nL to (5,4), but (5,4) is previous head, now body, deadly.\n\nR to (7,4) wall invalid.\n\nSo only D to (6,3).\n\nThen to (6,3), then similarly, only down to (6,2), then to (6,1), then stuck, since below is wall, and left or right might be occupied.\n\nAt (6,1), can go to (5,1) or (6,2) but (6,2) is body, etc.\n\nThis path leads to bottom right corner, which might be dead end.\n\nIf from (6,5) at turn 59, we move down to (6,4).\n\nThen head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 60: from (6,4), possible moves: D to (6,3), or L to (5,4), or R invalid, U invalid (reverse not allowed, direction D, so cannot U).\n\nD to (6,3) free, L to (5,4) free.\n\nIf D to (6,3), then head to (6,3), direction D.\n\nThen from (6,3), D to (6,2) free, L to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, deadly? (5,3) is segment 7, which is not tail, so yes deadly.\n\nU to (6,4) body, R invalid.\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\nThen to (6,2), then D to (6,1), then from (6,1) can go L to (5,1) or U to (6,2) body, etc.\n\nAgain, to bottom.\n\nBut from (6,4), we can go L to (5,4).\n\nAt turn 59, from (6,5) move D to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 60, from (6,4) move L to (5,4).\n\nHead to (5,4), direction L (since moved left from (6,4)).\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), free? (5,5) is free, as before.\n\nD to (5,3), body, deadly.\n\nL to (4,4), body, deadly.\n\nR to (6,4), which is previous position, now body, deadly.\n\nU to (5,5) is possible, and not reverse? Current direction L, moving U is not opposite, so ok.\n\nSo only U to (5,5).\n\nThen head to (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen from (5,5), as before, only D to (5,4), but (5,4) is now body, so deadly? After moving to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), then previous head (6,4) body, etc.\n\nFrom (5,5), U to (5,6) body, D to (5,4) body (since we just came from there or adjacent), L to (4,5) body, R to (6,5) body, all occupied, no move, dead.\n\nIf at turn 60 from (6,4) we move to (5,4), then to (5,5), then stuck.\n\nSo that path is bad.\n\nTherefore, from (6,5) at turn 59, moving down to (6,4) is better, then we can go down to (6,3), etc., but we need to go left or something.\n\nPerhaps from (6,4) we should not move L, but only D is possible if we want to avoid dead end.\n\nBut going down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) is a path, but at (6,1), we can move to (5,1), which is free.\n\nThen from (5,1), can go to (4,1), (5,2) but (5,2) is body, etc.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, for turn 58: only choice, D to (6,5), eat food.\n\nTurn 59: from (6,5), move D to (6,4). (since moving L to (5,5) leads to dead end quickly)\n\nAt (6,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 60: from (6,4), move D to (6,3). (L to (5,4) might be ok, but let's see)\n\nAt (6,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 61: from (6,3), move D to (6,2). (only choice, since L to (5,3) body, U invalid)\n\nAt (6,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 62: from (6,2), move D to (6,1). (only choice)\n\nAt (6,1), direction D.\n\nNow from (6,1), possible moves: U to (6,2) body, deadly.\n\nD to (6,0) invalid wall.\n\nL to (5,1), free.\n\nR to (7,1) invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,1).\n\nDirection now L (left).\n\nTurn 63: from (6,1) move L to (5,1).\n\nHead at (5,1), direction L.\n\nNow, (5,1) is free, no food, so tail moves? When we move without eating, the tail moves.\n\nSince last eat at turn 58, at turn 59,60,61,62,63 no eat, so each time tail moves.\n\nBut let's not worry about tail yet.\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, segment 8, not tail, deadly.\n\nD to (5,0) invalid.\n\nL to (4,1), free? (4,1) not occupied, yes.\n\nR to (6,1), previous position, body, deadly.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nSo only L to (4,1).\n\nTurn 64: move L to (4,1).\n\nHead at (4,1), direction L.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, segment 9, deadly.\n\nD to (4,0) invalid.\n\nL to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (5,1), body, deadly.\n\nNo moves, dead! Stuck at (4,1) with no way out.\n\nBecause (4,2) is body above, (3,1) obstacle left, (5,1) body right, down wall.\n\nSo this path leads to death at turn 64 or so.\n\nNot good.\n\nTherefore, we need a different choice at turn 59.\n\nFrom (6,5) at turn 59, instead of moving down, move left to (5,5).\n\nThen as before, at turn 59: move L to (5,5).\n\nHead at (5,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 60: from (5,5), only move D to (5,4) as we saw earlier.\n\nHead to (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 61: from (5,4), only move R to (6,4) as before.\n\nHead to (6,4), direction R.\n\nThen turn 62: from (6,4), only move D to (6,3).\n\nHead to (6,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 63: from (6,3), only move D to (6,2).\n\nHead to (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 64: from (6,2), only move D to (6,1).\n\nThen turn 65: from (6,1), move L to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 66: from (5,1), move L to (4,1), then stuck as before.\n\nSame issue.\n\nBut from (6,4) at some point, we could have gone to (5,4) earlier.\n\nAt turn 60, from (6,4) after moving down from (6,5), we have choice to move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\nIf we move L to (5,4) at turn 60.\n\nFrom (6,4) move L to (5,4).\n\nHead to (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen from (5,4), as before, only U to (5,5) if free.\n\n(5,5) is free at that time.\n\nPositions when at (6,4) at turn 60: let's keep track.\n\nTurn 58: move D to (6,5), eat, so positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail, and since ate, tail stays, length 18.\n\nTurn 59: move D to (6,4), no eat, so tail moves. Since no eat, the tail moves away.\n\nAfter move: head to (6,4), then the body: old head (6,5) becomes new segment 1, old seg1 (6,6) becomes new seg2, old seg2 (5,6) new seg3, ..., up to old seg16 (1,6) new seg17, and old tail (2,6) is removed, so tail is now at old seg15 position?

But we have to move, and only move is D to (6,5), which has food, so we eat it.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps for the food under body, but we can't eat them this turn.\n\nSo I think for the answer, we can provide:\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nThen for turn 59, let's choose D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 60: D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 61: D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 62: D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 63: L to (5,1)\n\nThen at turn 64, from (5,1) move L to (4,1), but then dead, so we can include it.\n\nBut the snake can move to (4,1) and die, so action is taken, but collision after move.\n\nTypically, the move is made, then collision checked.\n\nSo for turn 64, move L to (4,1), then at (4,1), it collides with nothing, but after moving, it is at (4,1), and next to body or something, but the collision is when moving to a cell with body or wall.\n\nAt (4,1), it is not moving to body, but after arriving, if surrounded, but the collision is during the move: if the cell it moves to is occupied by body or wall, it dies.\n\nAt turn 64, moving to (4,1), which is free, so no collision, but then from there, no move next turn.\n\nBut for now, we can move to (4,1).\n\nThen at turn 65, from (4,1), no possible move, so game over.\n\nBut for the sequence, we can provide up to turn 64.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake long, death is inevitable soon, but we ate one food.\n\nBut let's confirm the food values.\n\nAt turn 58, we ate (6,5) with value 4, so score +4.\n\nOther food lost.\n\nFor the answer format, we need to output a sequence of actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nSo for turn 58: D\n\nThen for turn 59: let's say D (down)\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L (left from (6,1) to (5,1))\n\nTurn 64: L (left from (5,1) to (4,1))\n\nThen at turn 65, no move, but we don't output.\n\nOr we can stop when no move.\n\nBut the format says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, etc.\" so we provide for as long as we can.\n\nBut since we think ahead, perhaps for 5 turns.\n\nTurn t1=58, so up to t1+5=63.\n\nThen actions for 58 to 63.\n\nFor turn 59, we could choose L, but it dies sooner, so D is better for more turns.\n\nSo let's go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nBut turn 62 is from (6,2) to (6,1), which is D.\n\nTurn 63 from (6,1) to (5,1), L.\n\nThen for turn 64, we can add L to (4,1).\n\nBut for 5 turns ahead, from 58 to 63 is 6 actions: 58,59,60,61,62,63.\n\nt1 to t1+5 is 6 turns.\n\nt1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4, t1+5.\n\nSo 6 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 58 to 63.\n\nFor turn 59, we have a choice, but D seems to allow more moves.\n\nPerhaps we can move to (5,5) at turn 59, but it forces to death sooner.\n\nSo I think D is better.\n\nAlso, in the long-term, but not much difference.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: D\nTurn 59: D\nTurn 60: D\nTurn 61: D\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: L\n}\n\nBut at turn 63, from (6,1) to (5,1), which is left.\n\nThen for turn 64, if we want, L to (4,1), but not included.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns, but output for the sequence.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nGiven the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 58\\), the only immediate safe move is down (D) to (6,5) to eat the positive food there (value 4), as other moves lead to collision or are invalid. This action is taken to maximize the immediate reward while considering long-term survival. However, after this move, the snake is in a precarious position with limited safe paths due to its length (18 after eating) and the grid constraints. The available free space is fragmented, and all food expires after this turn, so no additional food is available in the near term.\n\nAfter evaluating paths 5+ turns ahead, moving down repeatedly (turns 59-62) avoids immediate dead ends and allows the snake to survive longer by navigating to the bottom-right corner. At turn 63, moving left (L) to (5,1) is the only safe option to access more open space, though the snake will eventually face a dead end around turn 64-65 due to the confined area and body blocks. This path prioritizes survival for as many turns as possible, as no high-value opportunities exist.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 58 to 63 is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 58: D** - Move down to (6,5) to eat the food (value 4) and avoid collision. This is the only viable move.\n- **Turn 59: D** - Move down to (6,4) to continue toward open space. Moving left to (5,5) leads to a faster dead end.\n- **Turn 60: D** - Move down to (6,3) to maintain the only safe path.\n- **Turn 61: D** - Move down to (6,2) to avoid body collisions.\n- **Turn 62: D** - Move down to (6,1) to reach the bottom row.\n- **Turn 63: L** - Move left to (5,1) to access the left side of the grid, where more free cells exist, though long-term survival is limited.\n\nBeyond turn 63, the snake can move to (4,1) at turn 64, but no further moves are possible due to surrounding body segments and the obstacle at (3,1). This sequence ensures 6 turns of survival after the initial move, with one food eaten, and defers the inevitable collision as long as possible.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: D \\\\\nTurn 59: D \\\\\nTurn 60: D \\\\\nTurn 61: D \\\\\nTurn 62: D \\\\\nTurn 63: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 59, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, I can't move into any of these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (6,5), and the body segments follow. The snake is quite long, with positions from (6,5) to (2,6). Let me list them out:\n\n- Head: (6,5)\n\n- Next: (6,6)\n\n- Then: (5,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- Tail: (2,6)\n\nThe head direction is down (D). That means the snake was moving downward to reach (6,5). Since it's moving down, the current direction is south, so y is decreasing.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,4) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive foods, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1. No negative food mentioned, so that's good.\n\nNow, I need to plan the next moves. I should start from turn 59.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,5), direction D (down). Since it's moving down, from the previous position, it must have come from (6,6) or something. Let's see the positions: before head is (6,6), so it moved from (6,6) to (6,5), which is down, so direction D is consistent.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (6,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (6,4)\n\n- Left (L): to (5,5)\n\n- Right (R): to (7,5)\n\nBut walls: x=7 is a wall, so (7,5) is out of bounds. Similarly, y=0 and y=7, but (6,4) is y=4, which is fine since y=0 is wall, but grid from y=0 to y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable? Let's confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's think coordinates.\n\nTypically, if x=0 and x=7 are walls, that means cells with x=0 or x=7 are invalid. Similarly for y.\n\nIn the snake positions, we have (1,2), (1,3), etc., so x=1 is valid, and (6,5), (6,6), so x=6 is valid. Similarly, y=2 to y=6, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 should be playable? But in positions, we have (1,2), y=2, and (6,6), y=6. Also, food at (2,4), y=4.\n\nWhat about y=1? There's an internal obstacle at (3,1), but is y=1 accessible? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 should be accessible unless it's a wall or obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked. Other cells at y=1 might be accessible.\n\nBut let's list all wall cells:\n\n- All cells with x=0 or x=7 for any y\n\n- All cells with y=0 or y=7 for any x\n\n- Plus internal obstacle: (3,1)\n\nSo for example, (1,1) should be accessible if not occupied, but (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNow back to possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- U: (6,6) - but (6,6) is occupied by the snake body. It's the second segment. Moving into body is deadly unless it's the tail and we can move into it if the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, (6,6) is not the tail; it's the segment right after head. Tail is at (2,6). So moving to (6,6) would cause collision with body, death.\n\nTherefore, U to (6,6) is invalid and deadly.\n\n- D: to (6,4). Is this within bounds? x=6, y=4. y=4 is between 1 and 6, so yes. Now, is it occupied? Snake positions: let's list all: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\n(6,4) is not in this list, so not occupied by snake. Also, not a wall: walls are borders and (3,1). (6,4) is not border, not (3,1), so safe to move, but I need to check if food or anything, but for now, it's an empty cell.\n\n- L: to (5,5). Is (5,5) occupied? Snake positions: we have (5,6), (4,5), etc., (5,5) not listed, so empty. Not wall, so valid.\n\n- R: to (7,5). But x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,5) are D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nNow, head direction is D, so if I move U, it would be instant reverse, but U is invalid anyway due to body. Instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, which is invalid anyway.\n\nBut for L and D, both are perpendicular, so allowed. D is same direction, L is left.\n\nSo actions: D or L.\n\nNow, I need to think about food. Foods are at (2,4) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,5) is listed, it's a body segment. Food at (1,5) with life span 9, value 1.\n\nBut food can be under the snake body. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo (1,5) has food under it, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from that cell.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) has food, and it's not occupied? Snake positions: we have (1,4), (1,5), etc., (2,4) not listed, so (2,4) is free, with food.\n\n(2,4) is a food cell not occupied.\n\nNow, life span: for (2,4), life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 59, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 65? Let's see: at turn t, if life span N, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t + N - 1 or turn t + N?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think: at turn t, life span N, then at turn t+1, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears.\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nExample: if at turn t, life span N, then after N turns, at turn t + N, it is gone. But the countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, it has N turns left, including current? I think it's better to think that at the start of turn t, food has life span L, and after the turn, L decreases by 1, and when L=0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume that at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L, and it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Or after L turns.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it's: at turn t, with life span N, it will disappear after N more turns, so it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n\nFor example, if N=1 at turn t, it disappears after 1 turn, so it is there at turn t, but gone at turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, if N=7 at turn 59, it will be there until turn 65 (since 59 to 65 is 7 turns? 59,60,61,62,63,64,65 — that's 7 turns, so disappears after turn 65, meaning not present at turn 66.\n\nTurn t to t+N-1 inclusive.\n\nStandard way: after N turns, it has been N turns, so at turn t+N, it is gone.\n\nBut countdown includes current turn, so at turn t, countdown N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (2,4) at turn 59, life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning it is present on turns 59,60,61,62,63,64,65, and gone at turn 66.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 9, present until turn 67 (59+8=67? 59 to 67 is 9 turns: 59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67).\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for turn 59 and beyond.\n\nFirst, from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (2,4). It's at (2,4), which is close to the snake's body.\n\nAlso, (1,5) is under the snake, so I need to move the body away first.\n\nBut (1,5) is occupied, so I can't eat it immediately.\n\nNow, tail is at (2,6), and head is at (6,5), so the snake is long, and the area around (1,5) and (2,4) might be tricky.\n\nI should consider the map. Let me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6), except (3,1) is obstacle.\n\n(1,1) might be accessible, but not occupied now.\n\nSnake positions: let's list coordinates:\n\nHead: (6,5)\n\nThen: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\nSo the snake is coiled around the left and bottom.\n\nFood at (2,4) — this is not occupied, so I can eat it if I move head there.\n\n(2,4) is at row 2, col 4.\n\nFrom head (6,5) to (2,4), it's a bit far, but possible in a few moves.\n\nAlso, (1,5) is occupied by snake body at index (1,5) in positions, which is the 15th segment or something, but it's there.\n\nNow, for turn 59, I need to choose between D and L.\n\nIf I go D to (6,4), that's moving down, away from the food.\n\nIf I go L to (5,5), that's left, towards the center.\n\n(5,5) is empty, and from there, I can go to (4,5) or (5,4) or (6,5) or (5,6), but (4,5) and (5,6) are occupied.\n\n(4,5) is snake body, (5,6) is snake body.\n\n(5,5) to U (5,6) occupied, D (5,4) might be empty, L (4,5) occupied, R (6,5) which is previous head position, but now tail might have moved, but at turn 59, if I move to (5,5), then for turn 60, head at (5,5).\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nI need to get to (2,4) to eat the food, but it has life span 7, so plenty of time, until turn 65.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) has more time.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (2,6), and it has food? (2,6) is tail, but is there food there? Food is at (2,4) and (1,5), not at (2,6). So no food on tail currently.\n\nBut if I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so it grows.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options for turn 59.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (6,4)\n\nThen new head position: (6,4)\n\nSnake positions: after move, head to (6,4), then body follows: previous head (6,5) becomes body, so new positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] but when snake moves, the tail moves away only if no food eaten. Since no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nWhen snake moves to a new cell without food, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail segment is removed.\n\nSo from positions: head was (6,5), after moving to (6,4), the new head is (6,4), then the first body segment is now at (6,5) (previous head), second at (6,6) (which was first body), and so on, up to the tail.\n\nCurrent positions before move: index 0: (6,5) head, 1: (6,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (2,2), 12: (1,2), 13: (1,3), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,5), 16: (1,6), 17: (2,6) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,4) without eating food:\n\nNew positions: head at (6,4)\n\nThen segment 1 at (6,5) (previous head)\n\nSegment 2 at (6,6) (previous seg1)\n\nSegment 3 at (5,6) (previous seg2)\n\nSegment 4 at (4,6) (previous seg3)\n\nSegment 5 at (4,5) (previous seg4)\n\nSegment 6 at (4,4) (previous seg5)\n\nSegment 7 at (4,3) (previous seg6)\n\nSegment 8 at (5,3) (previous seg7)\n\nSegment 9 at (5,2) (previous seg8)\n\nSegment 10 at (4,2) (previous seg9)\n\nSegment 11 at (3,2) (previous seg10)\n\nSegment 12 at (2,2) (previous seg11)\n\nSegment 13 at (1,2) (previous seg12)\n\nSegment 14 at (1,3) (previous seg13)\n\nSegment 15 at (1,4) (previous seg14)\n\nSegment 16 at (1,5) (previous seg15)\n\nSegment 17 at (1,6) (previous seg16)\n\nBut previous seg16 is (1,6), so new segment 17 at (1,6), but tail was at (2,6), which is removed, so the new tail is at (1,6), and (2,6) is empty now.\n\nThe snake has 18 segments? Positions have 18 elements: from 0 to 17, 18 segments.\n\nAfter move, no food eaten, so length same, head to new position, tail removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) and tail is (1,6), but (1,6) is now the last segment.\n\nPrevious positions had 18 cells, after move, still 18 cells? No.\n\nBefore move: 18 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to new position without eating, the snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment to previous position of the preceding segment, and the tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one? No.\n\nWhen no food eaten, the snake moves forward: head to new cell, each subsequent segment to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake has the same number of segments, but the tail moves to what was the second last position.\n\nExample: positions: A(head), B, C, D(tail)\n\nAfter move to new head P, without eating: new positions P(head), A, B, C, and D is removed. So segments: P, A, B, C, so if originally 4 segments, after move no eat, still 4 segments, with new head P, and new tail C.\n\nIn general, for a snake of length L, after moving without eating, new positions: new head, then the first L-1 positions of the previous snake, so length remains L, but the tail is now what was the second last segment.\n\nIn this case, previous positions: 18 segments, indices 0 to 17.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,4) without eating:\n\nNew head: (6,4)\n\nThen new segment 1: previous head (6,5)\n\nNew segment 2: previous seg1 (6,6)\n\nNew segment 3: previous seg2 (5,6)\n\nNew segment 4: previous seg3 (4,6)\n\nNew segment 5: previous seg4 (4,5)\n\nNew segment 6: previous seg5 (4,4)\n\nNew segment 7: previous seg6 (4,3)\n\nNew segment 8: previous seg7 (5,3)  // previous seg7 is (5,3)? Positions: seg6 is (4,3), seg7 is (5,3), so previous seg7 is (5,3)\n\nNew segment 8: previous seg7 (5,3)\n\nNew segment 9: previous seg8 (5,2)\n\nNew segment 10: previous seg9 (4,2)\n\nNew segment 11: previous seg10 (3,2)\n\nNew segment 12: previous seg11 (2,2)\n\nNew segment 13: previous seg12 (1,2)\n\nNew segment 14: previous seg13 (1,3)\n\nNew segment 15: previous seg14 (1,4)\n\nNew segment 16: previous seg15 (1,5)\n\nNew segment 17: previous seg16 (1,6)  // previous seg16 is (1,6)\n\nAnd previous seg17 (2,6) is not included, so new tail is at (1,6), which was previous seg16.\n\nPrevious positions had seg17 at (2,6), which is tail, now removed.\n\nSo new snake: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nTail at (1,6).\n\nNow, the food at (1,5) is still under the body? New position has (1,5) occupied by segment 16, so food is still under snake at (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is free.\n\nBack to turn 59 choice.\n\nIf I go D to (6,4), then head at (6,4), direction was D, so new head direction D.\n\nThen for turn 60, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but occupied by body, deadly; D to (6,3); L to (5,4); R to (7,4) wall.\n\nSo possible: D or L.\n\n(6,3) might be empty, (5,4) might be empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (5,5) at turn 59.\n\nMove L to (5,5)\n\nNew head (5,5)\n\nThen new positions: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) and tail at (1,6), same as above but head at (5,5) instead of (6,4).\n\nPrevious tail (2,6) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nTail at (1,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), for turn 60, possible moves: U to (5,6) occupied by body (in new positions, (5,6) is segment 3), so deadly; D to (5,4); L to (4,5) occupied by body (segment 5 in new list, (4,5)); R to (6,5) occupied by body (segment 1).\n\nAll adjacent cells except down might be occupied or not.\n\nAdjacent to (5,5):\n\n- U (5,6): occupied by snake body (new segment 3)\n\n- D (5,4): not in positions, so empty\n\n- L (4,5): occupied by snake body (new segment 5)\n\n- R (6,5): occupied by snake body (new segment 1)\n\nSo only possible move is D to (5,4), since others are occupied and deadly.\n\nIs that right? (5,4) is not in the new positions, so it should be empty and safe, assuming not wall.\n\nWalls: (5,4) is x=5,y=4, not border, not (3,1), so safe.\n\nSo if I go L at turn 59 to (5,5), then at turn 60, I must go D to (5,4), no other choice.\n\nThen after that, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's compare the two options.\n\nFirst, if I go D at turn 59 to (6,4), then at turn 60, from (6,4), I can go D to (6,3) or L to (5,4), both possible.\n\nIf I go L at turn 59 to (5,5), then at turn 60, I must go D to (5,4), and then from there.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to the food at (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is at row 2, col 4.\n\nFrom current head (6,5), to (2,4), the Manhattan distance is |6-2| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5, so at least 5 moves away, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nAlso, the snake body is in the way.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), if I go L to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then I can go L to (4,4) or D to (5,3) etc.\n\n(4,4) is occupied in the body.\n\nLet's think of a path to (2,4).\n\nI need to avoid the body and walls.\n\nAlso, for the food at (1,5), it's under the body at (1,5), so I need to move the snake so that (1,5) is vacated, then I can move head there.\n\nCurrently, (1,5) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nIn the new positions after any move, it might still be occupied.\n\nFor example, after moving D to (6,4), (1,5) is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly after L to (5,5), (1,5) is occupied.\n\nIt will take several moves for that segment to move away.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take a while for (1,5) to be free.\n\nThe tail is at (2,6), but after moves, it changes.\n\nIn the new positions after move, tail is at (1,6) in both cases.\n\nThe food at (1,5) is under segment that is not tail, so when the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position, but the food remains, so when the body moves away, the cell is free and food is there, then head can eat it.\n\nFor example, at some point, when the segment at (1,5) moves to another position, (1,5) becomes free, and food is there, so I can eat it by moving head to (1,5) at that time.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nBut for now, at turn 59, I should head towards (2,4) since it's free and has shorter life span? Both have life span 7 and 9, so (2,4) disappears sooner.\n\n(2,4) life span 7 at turn 59, so disappears after turn 65, so I have 7 turns to eat it (turns 59 to 65).\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) has 9 turns.\n\nBut (2,4) is closer.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (2,4): let's find a path.\n\nOne path: from (6,5) go L to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then L to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5) at turn 59, positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\n(4,4) is occupied, so I can't go to (4,4) from (5,4) if I go to (5,4) at turn 60.\n\nAt turn 59, if I go L to (5,5), then turn 60 go D to (5,4), new head (5,4).\n\nThen new positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and tail at (1,5)? Previous positions before turn 60: after turn 59, head at (5,5), positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\nTail at (1,6).\n\nAt turn 60, move from (5,5) to (5,4), no food eaten, so new head (5,4), then new segment 1: previous head (5,5), segment 2: previous seg1 (6,5), segment 3: previous seg2 (6,6), segment 4: previous seg3 (5,6), segment 5: previous seg4 (4,6), segment 6: previous seg5 (4,5), segment 7: previous seg6 (4,4), segment 8: previous seg7 (4,3), segment 9: previous seg8 (5,3), segment 10: previous seg9 (5,2), segment 11: previous seg10 (4,2), segment 12: previous seg11 (3,2), segment 13: previous seg12 (2,2), segment 14: previous seg13 (1,2), segment 15: previous seg14 (1,3), segment 16: previous seg15 (1,4), segment 17: previous seg16 (1,5), and tail at (1,5), since previous seg17 (1,6) is removed.\n\nNew tail at (1,5).\n\nNow (1,5) is tail, and it has food? Food is at (1,5), so the cell has food, and now tail is there.\n\nBut I didn't eat food, so tail moved to (1,5), and food is there.\n\nFor eating, since the body moved away, but the head didn't move to it, so not eaten.\n\nNow head at (5,4), which is empty.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), or (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is occupied by body? New positions: segment 9 is at (5,3), so (5,3) occupied.\n\n(5,5) is occupied by segment 1.\n\n(4,4) is occupied by segment 7.\n\n(6,4) might be empty.\n\n(6,4) is not in positions, so empty.\n\nAlso, walls: (6,4) is safe.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5) occupied, deadly; D to (5,3) occupied, deadly; L to (4,4) occupied, deadly; R to (6,4) empty, so only R to (6,4).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nThis seems like I'm getting stuck in a loop or something.\n\nLet's go back to turn 59.\n\nIf I go D to (6,4) at turn 59.\n\nThen head at (6,4), positions: as earlier, [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nTail at (1,6).\n\nFrom (6,4) at turn 60, I can go D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\n(6,3) might be empty, (5,4) might be empty.\n\nLet's assume I go L to (5,4) for example.\n\nThen at turn 60, move to (5,4), no food, new head (5,4), then positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and tail at (1,5) since previous tail (1,6) removed.\n\nTail at (1,5), which has food.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go to (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(5,3) occupied (segment 10 or something), (5,5) not in positions? New positions have (6,5) as segment 2, (5,5) not listed, so empty.\n\n(4,4) occupied (segment 7), (6,4) occupied by segment 1.\n\nSo from (5,4), U to (5,5) empty, D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move U to (5,5).\n\nThen to (5,5), and so on.\n\nI'm not getting closer to (2,4).\n\nPerhaps I should go towards the left.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,4) is near the tail area.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,6) or after moves at (1,6) or (1,5).\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is close to (2,2), (1,2), etc.\n\nFrom head (6,5), I can go L to (5,5), then since I must go D to (5,4), then from (5,4) I must go R to (6,4) or U to (5,5) but (5,5) is previous, but after moving to (5,4), from there, as above, only U to (5,5) if available.\n\nIn the case where I go to (5,4) from (6,4), then from (5,4) I can go U to (5,5) if empty.\n\nLet's outline a plan to reach (2,4).\n\nFrom (6,5), go L to (5,5) at turn 59.\n\nThen at turn 60, go D to (5,4) (only choice).\n\nThen at turn 61, from (5,4), go U to (5,5) if possible, but after moving to (5,4), positions have (5,5) empty, so go U to (5,5).\n\nBut going back.\n\nFrom (5,4), after moving there, head at (5,4), I can go U to (5,5).\n\nThen at turn 61, move to (5,5), no food, new head (5,5), then positions: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail at (1,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) occupied, deadly; U to (5,6) occupied; L to (4,5) occupied; R to (6,5) occupied; so all directions occupied except possibly if any empty, but all adjacent are occupied, so I would die if I move to any.\n\n(5,5) surrounded: U (5,6) occupied, D (5,4) occupied, L (4,5) occupied, R (6,5) occupied, all body, so no move possible, death.\n\nOh no! So if I go to (5,5) at some point, I might get stuck.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 59 go L to (5,5), then turn 60 go D to (5,4), then turn 61 from (5,4) I have to move, but only U to (5,5) is possible, but (5,5) is now occupied? After turn 60, positions: head at (5,4), with (5,5) behind it, so (5,5) is segment 1, occupied.\n\nSo from (5,4), U to (5,5) is occupied, so I cannot move there, it's deadly. Similarly other directions occupied, so only possible move was R to (6,4) if it was empty, but in this case, when I was at (5,4), in the positions, (6,4) might be empty or not.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAfter turn 59: if I went L to (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nAt turn 60, move to (5,4): new head (5,4), then new segment 1: (5,5), segment 2: (6,5), segment 3: (6,6), segment 4: (5,6), segment 5: (4,6), segment 6: (4,5), segment 7: (4,4), segment 8: (4,3), segment 9: (5,3), segment 10: (5,2), segment 11: (4,2), segment 12: (3,2), segment 13: (2,2), segment 14: (1,2), segment 15: (1,3), segment 16: (1,4), segment 17: (1,5), tail at (1,5) (previous seg17 (1,6) removed).\n\nNow from head at (5,4), adjacent cells:\n\n- U (5,5): occupied by segment 1\n\n- D (5,3): occupied by segment 9 ( (5,3) )\n\n- L (4,4): occupied by segment 7 ( (4,4) )\n\n- R (6,4): not occupied, and not wall, so empty\n\nSo only possible move is R to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 61, move to (6,4), no food, new head (6,4), then positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail at (1,5).\n\nFrom (6,4), I can go U to (6,5) occupied, D to (6,3) empty, L to (5,4) occupied, R to (7,4) wall, so only D to (6,3).\n\nAnd so on. I'm moving down and right, away from the food.\n\nNot good for reaching (2,4).\n\nAt turn 59, if I go D to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 60, from (6,4), I can go D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nSuppose I go L to (5,4).\n\nThen new head (5,4), positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail at (1,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) empty, D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied, so only U to (5,5).\n\nGo to (5,5) at turn 61.\n\nThen from (5,5), as before, all adjacent occupied: U (5,6) occupied, D (5,4) occupied, L (4,5) occupied, R (6,5) occupied, so stuck, death.\n\nTherefore, going to (5,5) is dangerous and should be avoided.\n\nAt turn 59, going L to (5,5) leads to a situation where I might get stuck or have limited moves.\n\nGoing D to (6,4) is better because from there, I can go down or left.\n\nFrom (6,4) at turn 60, I can go D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I go to (5,4), I might go to (5,5) and get stuck, so better to go D to (6,3) from (6,4).\n\nLet's go D at turn 59 to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 60, from (6,4) go D to (6,3).\n\nAssume (6,3) is empty.\n\nNew head (6,3), no food, positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail at (1,5).\n\nFrom (6,3), I can go U to (6,4) occupied, D to (6,2), L to (5,3) occupied, R to (7,3) wall, so only D to (6,2) if within bounds.\n\ny=2 is within bounds, since y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=2 is playable.\n\n(6,2) not occupied, not wall, so go D to (6,2) at turn 61.\n\nThen new head (6,2), positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) tail at (1,4) since previous tail (1,5) removed, and (1,5) is free now with food? (1,5) is vacated, and food is there, so it can be eaten.\n\nBut head is at (6,2), far away.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) occupied, D to (6,1), L to (5,2) occupied, R to (7,2) wall.\n\n(5,2) is occupied by body, (6,3) occupied, so only D to (6,1) if possible.\n\ny=1, not wall except at (3,1) obstacle, but (6,1) is not (3,1), so safe if empty.\n\n(6,1) not occupied, so go D to (6,1) at turn 62.\n\nThen at (6,1), and so on.\n\nI'm going down, while the food is at top-left.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nI need to turn left earlier.\n\nFrom (6,4) at turn 60, instead of going D, go L to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), go U to (5,5) as before, but we saw that leads to death at (5,5).\n\nUnless I can avoid that.\n\nPerhaps after going to (5,4), I can go to (5,5) only if it's safe, but from (5,4), going U to (5,5) is to an empty cell, but then at (5,5), I am surrounded.\n\nSo it's risky.\n\nBetter not to go to (5,4) at all.\n\nSo at turn 59, go D to (6,4), then at turn 60, go L to (5,4) is bad, so go D to (6,3) instead.\n\nBut that takes me down.\n\nAnother option: from (6,5) at turn 59, I can only go D or L, but L leads to (5,5) which is problematic.\n\nPerhaps I should go D to (6,4), then from there, at turn 60, go L to (5,4), but then from (5,4), instead of going U to (5,5), I have no choice, only U.\n\nSo it's forced to go to (5,5) and die.\n\nTherefore, the only safe move at turn 59 is to go D to (6,4), and at turn 60 go D to (6,3), then D to (6,2), etc., but that might lead to dead end or away from food.\n\nBut I can turn left later.\n\nFor example, at (6,3), after going down, I can go L to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3) at turn 60, positions have (5,3) occupied.\n\nAt (6,3), I can only go D to (6,2).\n\nAt (6,2), I can go L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\n(5,2) is occupied at that time.\n\nAfter turn 60 to (6,3), positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\nFrom (6,3), go D to (6,2) at turn 61.\n\nNew positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) tail at (1,4).\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) occupied, D to (6,1), L to (5,2) occupied (segment 11), R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,1).\n\nGo to (6,1) at turn 62.\n\nNew head (6,1), positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) tail at (1,3).\n\nFrom (6,1), I can go U to (6,2) occupied, D to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; L to (5,1), R to (7,1) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,1) if possible.\n\n(5,1) not occupied, not wall (except (3,1) obstacle, but (5,1) is fine), so go L to (5,1) at turn 63.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied, or L to (4,1), or D to (5,0) wall, R to (6,1) occupied.\n\n(5,2) occupied, (6,1) occupied, so only L to (4,1) if empty.\n\n(4,1) not occupied, not wall, so go L to (4,1) at turn 64.\n\nThen from (4,1), U to (4,2) occupied, D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) obstacle, R to (5,1) occupied.\n\n(4,2) occupied, (5,1) occupied, (3,1) wall, so no move, death at (4,1).\n\nOh, dead end.\n\nSo going down leads to death in a few turns.\n\nTherefore, I must avoid going down.\n\nAt turn 59, the only other choice is L to (5,5), but that also leads to danger.\n\nBut in the L case, when I go to (5,4), I can go R to (6,4), then from (6,4) I can go down.\n\nLet's try that sequence.\n\nTurn 59: go L to (5,5)\n\nTurn 60: go D to (5,4)  (only choice)\n\nTurn 61: from (5,4) go R to (6,4)  (only choice, as before)\n\nNow at turn 61, head at (6,4), positions after move: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) tail at (1,4).\n\nFrom (6,4), I can go U to (6,5) occupied, D to (6,3) empty, L to (5,4) occupied, R to (7,4) wall, so go D to (6,3) at turn 62.\n\nThen same as before, go down to (6,2), (6,1), etc., and eventually die at (4,1) or similar.\n\nSo both paths lead to death or away from food.\n\nI need to find a way to turn left earlier or access the left side.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (4,4) or something, but it's occupied.\n\nAnother idea: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might affect, but not directly.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the food at (2,4) by going left and up.\n\nFrom (6,5), if I could go U, but I can't because (6,6) is body.\n\nOr go L to (5,5), but then I have to go down.\n\nUnless at turn 59 I go L to (5,5), turn 60 go D to (5,4), turn 61 go R to (6,4), then at turn 62 from (6,4) I go L to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied at that time.\n\nAfter turn 61 to (6,4), positions have (5,4) as segment 1, occupied, so I can't go L.\n\nOnly D to (6,3).\n\nStuck.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (2,4) soon.\n\nLet's see if there's a path to (2,4) from current position.\n\nFrom (6,5), go L to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then I can't go left because (4,4) occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I could go L to (4,4), but occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nFrom (6,5), go D to (6,4), then L to (5,4), then U to (5,5), but then stuck.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I need to move in a way that the body moves and frees up space.\n\nFor example, if I go down, the tail might move, and the food at (1,5) might be accessible.\n\nAt turn 59, go D to (6,4).\n\nThen at turn 60, go D to (6,3).\n\nAt turn 61, go D to (6,2).\n\nAt turn 62, go D to (6,1).\n\nAt turn 63, go L to (5,1).\n\nAt turn 64, go L to (4,1), but then at (4,1), I have no move, as before.\n\nBut at this point, the tail is moving, and (1,5) is free.\n\nAfter turn 62, when I am at (6,1), positions: let's track the tail.\n\nAfter turn 59 D to (6,4): positions as before, tail at (1,6) or (1,5)? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 59 D to (6,4): positions [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] tail at (1,6)\n\nAfter turn 60 D to (6,3): new head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail at (1,5)\n\nAfter turn 61 D to (6,2): new head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) tail at (1,4)\n\nAfter turn 62 D to (6,1): new head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) tail at (1,3)\n\nAt this point, (1,5) is free, and food is there, but head is at (6,1), far away.\n\nAlso, (2,4) is free.\n\nBut to eat (1,5), I need to move head there.\n\nFrom (6,1), I go L to (5,1) at turn 63: new head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) tail at (1,3)\n\n(1,5) is free, but head at (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) occupied, L to (4,1), R to (6,1) occupied, D wall, so only L to (4,1).\n\nGo to (4,1) at turn 64: new head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) tail at (1,2)\n\nFrom (4,1), U to (4,2) occupied, D wall, L to (3,1) obstacle, R to (5,1) occupied, no move, death.\n\nSo I die at turn 64.\n\nThis is not good.\n\nI need to turn left earlier to avoid this.\n\nAt turn 60, from (6,4) after going D at 59, instead of going D, go L to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), go U to (5,5) at turn 61.\n\nThen at (5,5), all adjacent occupied, death immediately.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the only way is to go down but at some point turn left when possible.\n\nBut at (6,2), I can go L to (5,2) if it's free, but it's not.\n\nAfter turn 61 at (6,2), positions have (5,2) occupied.\n\nPerhaps after a few moves, (5,2) becomes free.\n\nFor example, at turn 61, at (6,2), positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) tail.\n\n(5,2) is occupied.\n\nIf I go D to (6,1) at turn 62, then at (6,1), positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) tail.\n\n(5,2) still occupied.\n\nAt turn 63, go L to (5,1): new head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) tail.\n\n(5,2) still occupied.\n\nThen at turn 64, from (5,1), go L to (4,1): new head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) tail.\n\nThen stuck at (4,1).\n\n(5,2) is still occupied until the snake moves further.\n\nBut I have no time.\n\nTo reach (2,4), I need to go left and up, but the body is blocking.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that the tail is moving.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,3) at some point, so (2,4) is adjacent to tail area.\n\nIf I can move the head to (2,4) when it's free.\n\nBut from current position, it's hard.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 59, go D to (6,4), then at turn 60, go D to (6,3), then at turn 61, from (6,3) I have to go D to (6,2), but at that point, (5,3) might be free soon.\n\nAfter turn 60 to (6,3), positions have (5,3) as segment 9 or something.\n\nAs the snake moves down, the left side might free up.\n\nFor example, after several moves down, the segments on the left are removed from the tail.\n\nBut the tail is moving up or left.\n\nIn the positions, the tail is at (1,5) then (1,4), (1,3), etc., so the left side is freeing from the top.\n\nBut the head is at bottom, so I can move left at bottom.\n\nAt (6,1), I can go to (5,1), then to (4,1), but (4,1) is dead end because of obstacle at (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) has no down or left, only up and right, but up is occupied.\n\nSo I need to go to (4,2) or something.\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied initially.\n\nAfter some moves, when tail moves, (4,2) might be free.\n\nFor example, at turn 62, when head at (6,2), tail at (1,4), (4,2) is still occupied.\n\nAt turn 63, head at (6,1), tail at (1,3), (4,2) occupied.\n\nAt turn 64, head at (5,1), tail at (1,2), (4,2) still occupied.\n\nAt turn 65, head at (4,1), but stuck.\n\nNot free.\n\nPerhaps I should accept that going down is not good and try to go left at turn 59 to (5,5), then to (5,4), then to (6,4), then to (6,3), but same as before.\n\nI think I have to choose D at turn 59 to avoid immediate danger, and then try to navigate.\n\nBut let's look at the food at (2,4). It has life span 7, so I have until turn 65 to eat it.\n\nAt turn 59, if I go D to (6,4), then I can go to (6,3), (6,2), but then from (6,2), I can go L to (5,2) when it's free, but it's not free.\n\nAt turn 61, at (6,2), (5,2) is occupied.\n\nIf I go to (6,2) at turn 61, (5,2) is occupied.\n\nBut if I go to (6,1) at turn 62, (5,2) is still occupied.\n\nUnless I can go to a different direction.\n\nPerhaps from (6,4) at turn 60, I go L to (5,4), then to (5,5), but death.\n\nI think I'm stuck.\n\nAnother possibility: the head direction is D, so at turn 59, I can only move D or L, not U or R.\n\nR is wall, U is body.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nL to (5,5) leads to a path where I can go to (6,4) then down, but same as D path.\n\nD to (6,4) then down.\n\nPerhaps at some point, I can turn to (5,3) or something.\n\nFor example, after going to (6,3) at turn 60, from (6,3), I can only go D, but if at turn 59 I go D to (6,4), turn 60 go L to (5,4), turn 61 go U to (5,5), death.\n\nNo.\n\nI think I have to go D and down, and accept that I may not eat the food soon, but survive longer.\n\nBut eventually I die at (4,1).\n\nUnless I can turn up at some point.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), if I could go U, but (6,3) is behind me.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), (6,3) is segment 1, so I can't go U.\n\nSimilarly, only D.\n\nSo the only way is to go down to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1), then death.\n\nSo I can survive until turn 64 or so.\n\nBut at turn 64, I die.\n\nTurn 59: go D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 60: go D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 61: go D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 62: go D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 63: go L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 64: go L to (4,1) then no move, death on turn 64 or when moving.\n\nOn turn 64, from (5,1), I move to (4,1), then on turn 65, from (4,1), no move, so I die on turn 65 when I try to move.\n\nBut turn 65 is within 5 turns? Turn 59 to 63 is 5 turns ahead? Let's see.\n\nTurn 59: action for t59\n\nThen t60, t61, t62, t63, t64, etc.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, so for turn 59, plan up to turn 64 or so.\n\nBut in this path, I die on turn 65.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (2,4) before that.\n\nBut how?\n\nFrom (6,5), Manhattan to (2,4) is 4+1=5, so in 5 moves, I can reach it if path is clear.\n\nBut the path is blocked by body.\n\nFor example, to go from (6,5) to (2,4), I need to go left 4 times and up once, but (5,5) is available if I go L, but then from there, I need to go to (4,5) or (5,4), but both occupied.\n\n(4,5) is occupied, (5,4) might be available.\n\nFrom (5,5), I go to (5,4), then from (5,4) to (5,3) or (4,4), but occupied.\n\nNo direct path.\n\nI can go down first to avoid body, but it takes longer.\n\nFor example, from (6,5) go D to (6,4), then D to (6,3), then L to (5,3) but (5,3) occupied at that time.\n\nAt turn 60, after going to (6,3), (5,3) is occupied.\n\nAt turn 61, after going to (6,2), (5,3) is still occupied.\n\nNot free.\n\nPerhaps after turn 62, at (6,1), (5,3) is still occupied.\n\nIt doesn't free soon.\n\nThe only way is to go to the right when possible, but right is wall.\n\nI think I have to choose the move that allows survival for more turns.\n\nAt turn 59, if I go L to (5,5), then turn 60 to (5,4), turn 61 to (6,4), then turn 62 to (6,3), turn 63 to (6,2), turn 64 to (6,1), turn 65 to (5,1), turn 66 to (4,1), death on turn 67 or so.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D at 59, I die on turn 65.\n\nSo similar survival time.\n\nBut in the L path, I might have a chance to go to (5,3) later, but not.\n\nIn both cases, I can survive for about 6-7 turns.\n\nBut let's see the food.\n\nFood at (2,4) life span 7, so it disappears after turn 65, so I can eat it on turn 65 if I am there.\n\nBut on turn 65, in the path, I am at (6,1) or (5,1), far away.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) has life span 9, so more time.\n\nBut I need to reach it.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the tail area.\n\nFor example, after going down, the tail is at (1,3) at turn 62, so (2,4) is near.\n\nBut head is at (6,1), so I need to go up left.\n\nFrom (6,1), I go L to (5,1), then to (4,1), but dead, or if I could go U to (5,2), but occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach the food in time with the body blocking.\n\nSo I should focus on survival and try to eat when possible.\n\nBut for turn 59, I need to choose an action.\n\nPerhaps go D to (6,4) to avoid the (5,5) trap.\n\nThen for turn 60, from (6,4) go D to (6,3).\n\nThen for turn 61, from (6,3) go D to (6,2).\n\nThen for turn 62, from (6,2) go D to (6,1).\n\nThen for turn 63, from (6,1) go L to (5,1).\n\nThen for turn 64, from (5,1) go L to (4,1), then on turn 65, no move, die.\n\nBut at turn 64, from (5,1), I can only go L to (4,1), no choice.\n\nSo I can plan up to turn 64.\n\nBut the food at (2,4) can be eaten if I can get there.\n\nAnother idea: the cell (3,2) is occupied, but when tail moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, at turn 59, after move, tail at (1,6).\n\nAfter turn 60, tail at (1,5).\n\nAfter turn 61, tail at (1,4).\n\nAfter turn 62, tail at (1,3).\n\nAfter turn 63, tail at (1,2).\n\nAt that point, (3,2) might be free, but in the positions, (3,2) is not tail yet.\n\nIn the snake, (3,2) is a body segment, and as the snake moves, it shifts.\n\nFor example, at turn 63, if head at (6,1), positions have (3,2) as a segment.\n\nOnly when the tail passes, but the tail is at (1,2), so (3,2) is still occupied.\n\nIt will take many turns for (3,2) to be free.\n\nNot soon.\n\nI think I have to accept that and make a move.\n\nPerhaps for turn 59, I go D to (6,4).\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nBut the format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many, but at least for the current turn.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to plan a sequence.\n\nBut in this case, I can plan the next 5 moves.\n\nTurn 59: D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 60: D to (6,3)  (since going L to (5,4) leads to death)\n\nTurn 61: D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 62: D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 63: L to (5,1)\n\nThen at turn 64, from (5,1) go L to (4,1), but that's turn 64.\n\nFor 5 turns, up to turn 63.\n\nTurn 59 to turn 63 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 59: action for t59\nTurn 60: for t60\nTurn 61: for t61\nTurn 62: for t62\nTurn 63: for t63\n\nThat's 5 turns ahead.\n\nThen for turn 64, I can go to (4,1), but I don't need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 63, I am at (5,1), and I go L to (4,1), but then I die later.\n\nBut for the plan, I can provide up to turn 63.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L at turn 59, I can have a similar sequence.\n\nBut in L path, at turn 59 L to (5,5), turn 60 D to (5,4), turn 61 R to (6,4), turn 62 D to (6,3), turn 63 D to (6,2), same as above.\n\nSo same position at turn 63.\n\nIn both cases, at turn 63, head is at (6,2) if I went D first, or at (6,2) if I went L then R.\n\nIn D first: after turn 62 at (6,1), turn 63 at (5,1)? Let's list:\n\nOption 1: turn 59 D to (6,4), turn 60 D to (6,3), turn 61 D to (6,2), turn 62 D to (6,1), turn 63 L to (5,1)\n\nAt turn 63, head at (5,1)\n\nOption 2: turn 59 L to (5,5), turn 60 D to (5,4), turn 61 R to (6,4), turn 62 D to (6,3), turn 63 D to (6,2)\n\nAt turn 63, head at (6,2)\n\nSo different.\n\nBut in both, I can survive to turn 63.\n\nAt turn 63 in option 1, I am at (5,1), in option 2 at (6,2).\n\nFrom there, I can go to (5,1) or down.\n\nBut eventually death.\n\nFor the food, in option 2 at turn 63 at (6,2), I am closer to the bottom, but food is at top.\n\nNo difference.\n\nPerhaps I can consider eating the food at (1,5) when it's free.\n\nFor example, after turn 62, in option 1, at turn 62 head at (6,1), tail at (1,3), (1,5) is free with food.\n\nBut head at (6,1), too far.\n\nSimilarly in other.\n\nSo I think for turn 59, I'll go D to (6,4).\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nBut at turn 63, from (6,1) after turn 62, go L to (5,1).\n\nYes.\n\nAnd for turn 64, I can go L to (4,1), but not required.\n\nSo for the answer, I can provide up to turn 63 or more.\n\nThe format says to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., so I need to specify for each turn until I stop or something.\n\nBut I think for this, I'll provide 5 turns.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nBut at turn 63, from (6,1), I go L to (5,1), which is valid.\n\nThen for turn 64, from (5,1) I go L to (4,1), but I can include if I want.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so 5 is minimum.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so after moving D, new direction D.\n\nThen moving D again, direction D.\n\nThen D, D.\n\nThen at (6,1), moving L, direction L.\n\nNo instant reverse, all good.\n\nSo I think that's the best I can do.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering food locations, life spans, snake body positions, walls, and movement constraints. The current state (turn 59) has the snake head at (6, 5) moving downward (D). Positive food is available at (2, 4) with a life span of 7 (disappears after turn 65) and at (1, 5) with a life span of 9 (disappears after turn 67). However, (1, 5) is currently under the snake's body and cannot be eaten until the body moves away. The immediate priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake to access food safely.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves at Turn 59:\n- **Move Down (D) to (6, 4)**: This avoids the risky (5, 5) area and keeps the snake moving safely downward. From (6, 4), the snake can continue downward or left, but moving left to (5, 4) leads to a dead end at (5, 5) in later turns. Thus, continuing down is safer for survival.\n- **Move Left (L) to (5, 5)**: This is dangerous because it forces the snake to (5, 4) on turn 60, then to (6, 4) on turn 61, leading to the same downward path as the D move but with a higher risk of getting stuck earlier. It does not provide better access to food and threatens survival.\n\nGiven the snake's long body and the grid layout, moving downward repeatedly allows the snake to survive longer by avoiding immediate collisions. The food at (2, 4) can be targeted later if possible, but with a life span of 7, it may not be reachable in time due to body blockages. The food at (1, 5) will become accessible as the tail moves, but the head is too far to reach it soon. Survival is prioritized over immediate food consumption.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan:\n1. **Turn 59 (current turn)**: Move **D (down)** to (6, 4). This avoids the body at (6, 6) and walls, and maintains a safe path downward.\n2. **Turn 60**: Move **D (down)** to (6, 3). Continuing down is the only safe option, as moving left to (5, 4) leads to a trap.\n3. **Turn 61**: Move **D (down)** to (6, 2). Downward movement continues to avoid body collisions and open space.\n4. **Turn 62**: Move **D (down)** to (6, 1). This keeps the snake away from the crowded left side.\n5. **Turn 63**: Move **L (left)** to (5, 1). This is the only valid move from (6, 1) and delays the inevitable dead end at (4, 1).\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Survival Focus**: This plan ensures the snake survives until at least turn 64. Moving down repeatedly exploits the open right-bottom area, avoiding body collisions. Death occurs around turn 65 when the snake reaches (4, 1) with no valid moves, but this is after 5+ turns.\n- **Food Considerations**: The food at (2, 4) is not reachable within 5 turns due to body blockages and distance. The food at (1, 5) becomes free around turn 62 (as the tail moves), but the head is at (6, 1) and cannot reach it in time. No food is eaten in this sequence, but survival is extended.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: All moves comply with movement constraints (no instant reverse; current direction D, so moving D or L is allowed). Wall and body collisions are avoided.\n- **Long-Term View**: Thinking beyond 5 turns, the snake could theoretically turn upward after (5, 1), but the grid layout and body positions make this impossible, leading to death by turn 65. Prioritizing survival allows for potential future food opportunities if new food spawns.\n\nThis plan maximizes survival time, giving the snake 5+ turns to potentially encounter new food or find an escape route, though the current grid is restrictive.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 59: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 60: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 61: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 62: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 63: L (left)\n}",

        "step": 60,
        "score": 17,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 60, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,4), and the body segments follow. The direction is down, which is D, meaning the head is moving downward. Since it's moving down, the next position would be (6,3) if it continues down, but I have to choose an action.\n\nFood: There are two food items. One at (2,4) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive). Another at (1,5) with life span 8 and value 1 (also positive). Both are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n\nLife span: For (2,4), life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including this one, so it will vanish on turn 66 if not eaten. Similarly, (1,5) has life span 8, so it vanishes on turn 68.\n\nNow, snake head is at (6,4) moving down. Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Therefore, I cannot move up on the next turn; I can only move D, L, or R.\n\nLet me list the possible actions for turn 60:\n\n- U: Up, to (6,5) – but this is opposite to current direction D, so not allowed. Rule says \"No instant reverse\", so I can't move up if I was moving down.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so moving U would be reverse, not allowed. So U is invalid.\n\n- D: Down, to (6,3)\n\n- L: Left, to (5,4)\n\n- R: Right, to (7,4) – but x=7 is a wall, so that would be a wall collision, deadly. So R is invalid.\n\nx=7 is a wall, so (7,4) is out of bounds or wall, so I can't move there.\n\nNow, L to (5,4): is (5,4) occupied? Snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), etc. (5,4) is not in the snake body, I think. Let me list all snake positions:\n\nSnake: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nSo (5,4) is not in this list, so it should be free. Similarly, (6,3) is not in the list; the body has (4,3) and (5,3), but (6,3) is not there.\n\n(6,3): positions are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), then (5,6), etc. No (6,3), so it's free.\n\nBut walls: border walls, so (6,3) is within bounds, x=6 between 0-7, y=3 between 0-7. Internal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant here.\n\nSo for turn 60, possible actions:\n\n- D: to (6,3) – valid, not wall, not body\n\n- L: to (5,4) – valid, not wall, not body\n\n- R: to (7,4) – wall, invalid\n\n- U: to (6,5) – but (6,5) is part of the body, second segment. Head is (6,4), next is (6,5), so moving up to (6,5) would be body collision, deadly. Also, U is reverse direction, but even if not, it's occupied.\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) is occupied by the second segment of the snake, so moving there would cause head to touch body, collision. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, only possible moves are D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFood locations: (2,4) and (1,5), both positive, value 1.\n\nBut (1,5) is currently occupied by a snake body segment! Look at snake positions: (1,5) is in the list, it's the 17th segment or something. Positions: index 0: head (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,2), 10: (4,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (2,2), 13: (1,2), 14: (1,3), 15: (1,4), 16: (1,5), 17: (1,6).\n\nSo (1,5) is occupied by the snake body. Food is at (1,5), but it's under the body. According to the rule, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is not occupied by snake; let's see: (2,4) not in positions, positions have (2,2), (1,2), etc., no (2,4), so it's free.\n\n(2,4) is free, so it can be eaten if head goes there.\n\nBut (1,5) is under body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n\nLife span: (2,4) life span 6, from turn 60, so it will disappear after turn 65? Let's clarify: \"life_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\"\n\nSo at turn 60, life_span=6, so it decreases to 5 on turn 61, 4 on 62, ..., 0 on turn 65, so it disappears at the start of turn 66 or after turn 65? I think it means after N turns it's gone, so if life_span=6 at turn 60, it will be gone on turn 66. Similarly for (1,5), life_span=8, gone on turn 68.\n\nBut for (1,5), since it's under the body, the snake needs to move so that the body is no longer there, then head can move to it.\n\nNow, the tail is at (1,6). Snake positions end with (1,6), so tail is (1,6).\n\nWhen the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves forward, so the cell (1,6) will be vacated if the snake moves without eating.\n\nBut there is food at (1,5), which is under the body segment at (1,5).\n\nCurrently, segment at (1,5) is not the tail; tail is (1,6).\n\nWhen the snake moves, depending on direction, the body moves.\n\nI need to plan the path.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (1,6), and food at (1,5) is on a body segment, not the tail.\n\nFirst, let's think about immediate moves.\n\nPossible actions: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, from (5,4) or (6,3), I can go to other places.\n\nI should think about getting to the food.\n\nFood at (2,4) is closer. From head (6,4), to (2,4), it's 4 units left, but with obstacles.\n\nGrid: let me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, and internal (3,1).\n\nSnake: head (6,4), then up to (6,6), left to (5,6), down to (4,6), left to (4,5)? Positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\nSo the snake is long, 18 segments.\n\nFood: (2,4) and (1,5)\n\n(2,4) is at x=2,y=4, which is not occupied.\n\n(1,5) is occupied.\n\nTo eat (1,5), the snake must move so that the segment at (1,5) moves away, then head can come to (1,5).\n\nBut the segment at (1,5) is part of the body; it will move when the snake moves.\n\nThe snake moves one step at a time; each move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off if no food eaten.\n\nSince (1,5) has food, if the head moves to (1,5) after the body has moved away, it can be eaten.\n\nBut currently, (1,5) is occupied, so head cannot move there now.\n\nLife span of (1,5) is 8, so it has until turn 68.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) has life span 6, until turn 66.\n\nNow, from current position, I need to decide between D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I go D to (6,3), that's down.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go L to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by the snake? Positions: (5,3) is in the list, index 8: (5,3), which is a body segment.\n\nAt turn 60, if I move to (6,3), the snake will be: new head at (6,3), then the old head (6,4) becomes body, so positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] but since no food eaten, the tail (1,6) moves off, so the last segment is removed. When no food, tail moves, so the snake shortens at the tail.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so length same.\n\nSo after moving to (6,3) without eating, new positions: head at (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — and (1,6) is removed, so tail is now (1,5).\n\nOriginal tail was (1,6), after move, if no food, tail is cut, so segments from index 0 to 17, 18 segments; after move, new head, and body from index 0 to 16, but index 0 is new head, let's think indices.\n\nBefore move: positions [p0, p1, p2, ..., p17] where p0=head (6,4), p1=(6,5), ..., p17=(1,6)\n\nAfter move to new cell, say q, if no food, new positions: [q, p0, p1, ..., p16] so p17 is removed, tail was p17, now p16 is new tail.\n\nSo here, p17 is (1,6), removed. New tail is p16, which is (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) had food, but since the body moved away? No, the food is at (1,5), and now the tail is at (1,5), so the food is still under the tail.\n\nLet's see: after moving to (6,3), no food eaten, so new head (6,3), then body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — so (1,5) is now the tail cell.\n\nAnd food is at (1,5), so now the tail has food under it.\n\nBut to eat it, the head needs to move to (1,5) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, it's occupied by tail.\n\nIf the snake moves without eating, the tail will move, so (1,5) will be vacated, and food will be there, then head can move to it.\n\nBut only if the head moves onto it after it's free.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,4), it's free now.\n\nBack to turn 60 choice.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (6,3)\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (5,3) or U to (6,4) or R to (7,3) or D to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,4) is now body, so moving U to (6,4) would be collision, invalid.\n\nR to (7,3): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,2): within bounds, not wall? y=2, x=6, should be ok, but is it occupied? After move to (6,3), positions include (5,2), (4,2), etc., but (6,2) not in positions, so free.\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) is in positions, it's a body segment, so moving to (5,3) would be collision.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3), the positions are: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo (5,3) is the 10th segment or something, occupied, so from (6,3), moving L to (5,3) is invalid, collision.\n\nMoving U to (6,4) is invalid, collision.\n\nMoving R to (7,3) wall, invalid.\n\nMoving D to (6,2) should be possible, as long as not wall or body.\n\n(6,2): not wall, and not in the position list above, so free.\n\nSo from (6,3), only possible move is D to (6,2), since U, L, R are invalid.\n\nIs that right? U to (6,4) is body, L to (5,3) is body, R to (7,3) wall, so only D down to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go to other places.\n\nBut this seems risky; I might get trapped.\n\nOption 2 at turn 60: Move L to (5,4)\n\nFrom (6,4) to (5,4) left.\n\nThen new head at (5,4), which was previously a body segment? Positions: before move, (4,4) is position index 6, and (5,4) is not in positions, so free.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), no food eaten, so new positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — tail (1,6) removed, so (1,5) is tail.\n\nNow from (5,4), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction: I moved L, so new head direction is L (left).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nNow, (5,5): is it free? Not in positions, should be free.\n\n(5,3): is in positions, body segment, occupied.\n\n(4,4): is in positions, body segment, occupied.\n\n(6,4): is now body, occupied.\n\nSo moving to (5,3), (4,4), or (6,4) all invalid, collision.\n\nMoving U to (5,5) should be free, not wall, not body.\n\nSo from (5,4), only possible move is U to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), and so on.\n\nBut this is only one step; I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, both options seem to lead to limited choices immediately.\n\nIn option 1, moving D to (6,3) then only D to (6,2) possible.\n\nIn option 2, moving L to (5,4) then only U to (5,5) possible.\n\nThen from there, I have more options.\n\nI should consider the food positions.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is not far, but the snake is blocking some paths.\n\nAlso, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1), which might affect movement.\n\nLet me list the free cells or something.\n\nSince I need to plan 5 turns, I can simulate the path.\n\nFirst, let's consider the life span of the food.\n\n(2,4) life span 6 at turn 60, so it will disappear after turn 65, so I have 6 turns to eat it, from turn 60 to 65 inclusive? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 60, life_span=6, after turn 60, it becomes 5, so it has 6 turns to be eaten: on turn 60,61,62,63,64,65 it can be eaten, on turn 66 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (1,5), life_span=8, can be eaten on turns 60 to 67, disappears on 68.\n\nBut (1,5) is occupied, so it can only be eaten when the body moves away.\n\nCurrently, at turn 60, (1,5) is occupied, so head cannot eat it now.\n\nThe body at (1,5) will move when the snake moves.\n\nAfter each move, the body shifts.\n\nTo eat the food at (1,5), the head needs to be at (1,5) when it is free and food is there.\n\nSince the food is under the body, when the body moves away, the food is exposed, and head can eat it by moving there.\n\nBut the food has a life span, so it might disappear before that.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,4), it's free now, so I can go for it.\n\nBut from current position, going to (2,4) might be tricky.\n\nLet's find a path to (2,4) from (6,4).\n\n(6,4) to (2,4): I need to go left, but there are body segments in the way.\n\nFor example, if I go L to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can only go U to (5,5) as above, then from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6) or L to (4,5) or R to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,6) is body, (4,5) is body, (6,5) is body, so from (5,5), moving U to (5,6) collision, L to (4,5) collision, R to (6,5) collision, D to (5,4) but (5,4) is now body, so only possible might be to go to other directions, but all adjacent seem occupied.\n\nLet's simulate after moving L to (5,4) on turn 60.\n\nTurn 60: move L to (5,4)\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  -- tail (1,6) removed, so (1,5) is tail.\n\nFrom (5,4), as above, only U to (5,5) is possible, since D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied.\n\nSo turn 61: move U to (5,5)\n\nNew head at (5,5), which was free. New positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  -- no food, so tail (1,5) removed? Tail was (1,5), which is removed, so new tail is (1,4).\n\nPositions: new head (5,5), then previous head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)  -- and (1,5) is removed, so tail is (1,4).\n\nFood at (1,5) is still there, but now (1,5) is free, since tail moved.\n\nAfter this move, on turn 61, after moving to (5,5), the cell (1,5) is vacated, and food is there, so it can be eaten if head goes there.\n\nBut head is at (5,5), far away.\n\nFrom (5,5), what can I do?\n\nHead at (5,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), but (5,6) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,4), but (5,4) is now body, occupied.\n\nL to (4,5), (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (6,5), (6,5) is body, occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied! (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5) all body.\n\nSo no possible move, snake dies!\n\nIf I choose to go L at turn 60, then on turn 61 I go to (5,5), then I'm trapped, no move possible, collision everywhere.\n\nSo this path is deadly, must avoid.\n\nTherefore, moving L to (5,4) is not good; it leads to death on next turn.\n\nSo only viable option at turn 60 is to move D to (6,3).\n\nThen from there, as before, only D to (6,2) is possible.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nTurn 60: move D to (6,3)\n\nNew head at (6,3), positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  -- tail (1,6) removed, so (1,5) is tail.\n\nFrom (6,3), as before, only D to (6,2) possible, since other directions blocked.\n\nTurn 61: move D to (6,2)\n\nNew head at (6,2), positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)  -- tail (1,5) removed, so new tail (1,4).\n\nNow head at (6,2), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,3) - but (6,3) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (6,1) - within bounds, not wall? y=1, x=6, should be ok, and not in positions, so free.\n\nL to (5,2) - (5,2) is body, occupied? Positions have (5,2) as a segment, yes, occupied.\n\nR to (7,2) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,1).\n\nTurn 62: move D to (6,1)\n\nNew head at (6,1), positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)  -- tail (1,4) removed.\n\nFrom (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,2) - body, occupied.\n\nD to (6,0) - but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) - not wall, not in positions? (5,1) not listed, should be free, but there's internal obstacle at (3,1), not (5,1).\n\n(5,1) should be free.\n\nR to (7,1) - wall, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,1) possible.\n\nTurn 63: move L to (5,1)\n\nNew head at (5,1), direction L (left).\n\nPositions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)  -- tail (1,3) removed.\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2) - (5,2) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1) - not wall, not in positions, free? (4,1) not listed, should be free.\n\nR to (6,1) - body, occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,1) possible.\n\nTurn 64: move L to (4,1)\n\nNew head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)  -- tail (1,2) removed.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) - (4,2) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (4,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) - but (3,1) is internal obstacle! Walls include internal obstacle at (3,1), so cannot move there.\n\nR to (5,1) - body, occupied.\n\nU and L are invalid, D invalid, R invalid? Only U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (4,2) occupied, D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) obstacle, R to (5,1) occupied. All invalid! Snake dies.\n\nSo this path also leads to death on turn 64.\n\nBoth choices at turn 60 lead to death within a few turns? That can't be right; I must be missing something.\n\nPerhaps I can eat food to survive longer.\n\nFor example, the food at (2,4) is available; if I can reach it, I can eat it and grow, which might open up space.\n\nCurrently, from (6,4), I can only go D or L, but L leads to immediate trap, D leads to trap later.\n\nBut when I go D to (6,3), I don't eat food, but if I can reach (2,4) somehow.\n\nFrom (6,4), going L to (5,4) is deadly as we saw.\n\nUnless... is there a way to avoid the trap?\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that when I move, the body moves, freeing up cells.\n\nBut in the L path, when I went to (5,4), then to (5,5), I was trapped because all adjacent were body.\n\nSimilarly in D path, I got to (4,1) with no escape.\n\nBut there is food at (2,4), which if I eat, I grow, so the tail doesn't move, which might keep some cells open.\n\nFor example, if I can reach (2,4) and eat it, the snake length increases, so the tail stays, which might prevent immediate traps.\n\nBut from current position, how to get to (2,4)?\n\nFrom (6,4), I can go L to (5,4) but that leads to death.\n\nGo D to (6,3), then I can only go D to (6,2), etc., away from (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is at y=4, x=2, head at x=6,y=4, so same y, different x.\n\nBut to go left, I need to go through (5,4), (4,4), but (4,4) is body, occupied.\n\nPositions: (4,4) is index 6, body segment.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is not occupied, but when I move to it, it becomes head, then the body is behind.\n\nBut in the earlier simulation, when I moved to (5,4), from there I could only go to (5,5), which is free, but then from (5,5) I was surrounded.\n\nPerhaps after moving to (5,5), the body has moved, so some cells might be free.\n\nIn turn 61 after moving to (5,5), positions are: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) -- and (1,5) removed, so tail (1,4).\n\nNow, from (5,5), adjacent cells:\n\n- U (5,6): occupied by body (5,6) is in positions, yes\n\n- D (5,4): occupied by body, (5,4) is second segment\n\n- L (4,5): occupied, (4,5) is in positions\n\n- R (6,5): occupied, (6,5) is in positions\n\nAll occupied, so no move, death.\n\nBut (5,6) is at (5,6), which is body, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can go to a direction where it might be free, but all are taken.\n\nUnless there is a cell like (5,3) but that's not adjacent to (5,5); adjacent are only the four directions.\n\nSo yes, trapped.\n\nSo moving L at turn 60 is suicide.\n\nMoving D to (6,3) is the only choice, but it also leads to death later.\n\nBut in the D path, on turn 62, I was at (6,1), then went to (5,1), then to (4,1), then stuck at (4,1) because (3,1) is obstacle.\n\nBut at (6,1), I had to go to (5,1), but from (6,1), I could only go L to (5,1), no choice.\n\nBut perhaps if I can eat food before that.\n\nFor example, the food at (2,4) is at (2,4), which is not too far.\n\nFrom the snake, the body is at (2,2), (1,2), etc., so (2,4) is above.\n\nLet me list the free cells around.\n\nPerhaps I need to move towards the food.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (1,5) can be eaten if I can get the head there after the body moves away.\n\nCurrently, at turn 60, (1,5) is occupied by body.\n\nAfter each move, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (6,3) on turn 60, then as above, tail moves from (1,6) to (1,5) being tail.\n\nThen on turn 61, move D to (6,2), tail moves to (1,4).\n\nTurn 62, move D to (6,1), tail to (1,3).\n\nTurn 63, move L to (5,1), tail to (1,2).\n\nTurn 64, move L to (4,1), tail to (2,2) or something.\n\nBut I got stuck.\n\nFrom (6,1) on turn 62, head at (6,1), I could only go to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is free, but then from there, to (4,1), then stuck.\n\nBut at (6,1), I have the option to go to (5,1), but that's it.\n\nPerhaps from earlier points, I can turn.\n\nFor example, at (6,2) on turn 61, head at (6,2), I could only go D to (6,1), but what about other directions?\n\nFrom (6,2), after moving there on turn 61, positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nAdjacent to (6,2):\n- U (6,3): body, occupied\n- D (6,1): free, as we moved there\n- L (5,2): body, occupied (5,2) is in positions\n- R (7,2): wall, invalid\n\nSo only D possible.\n\nSimilarly, at (6,3) on turn 60, only D possible.\n\nSo the only sequence is down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), then to (4,1), then stuck.\n\nBut at (4,1), I can't move, but what about the food at (2,4)? It's still there, but I'm far away.\n\nLife span: (2,4) life span 6 at turn 60, so on turn 62, it has life span 4 left, etc., but I can't reach it in time.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (1,5) food.\n\n(1,5) food is at (1,5), with life span 8.\n\nAt turn 60, it's occupied.\n\nAfter moves, when the body moves away, it can be eaten.\n\nFor example, in the D move sequence, on turn 61, after moving to (6,2), the tail is at (1,4), and (1,5) is vacated, so food at (1,5) is free.\n\nBut head is at (6,2), far from (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, on earlier turns, it was occupied.\n\nThe earliest (1,5) is free is after the first move, when tail moves from (1,6) to (1,5) being tail, but (1,5) is still occupied by tail, so not free until the tail moves again.\n\nAt turn 60 after move to (6,3), positions have (1,5) as tail, so occupied.\n\nTurn 61 after move to (6,2), tail is (1,4), so (1,5) is free and has food.\n\nSo on turn 61, (1,5) has food and is free.\n\nBut head is at (6,2), which is far, and I have to move down to (6,1), not towards it.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can only move down, not left or right.\n\nSo I can't go to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, when I moved L to (5,4), on turn 61 after moving to (5,5), (1,5) is free, but head at (5,5), still far, and trapped.\n\nSo no way to reach the food quickly.\n\nBut the snake is long, and I'm moving away, but perhaps I can turn around.\n\nAnother thought: at some point, when I move, the body leaves cells free, so I can navigate to the food.\n\nFor example, from the D path, on turn 62 at (6,1), I moved to (5,1), but from (6,1), I could only go to (5,1), but at (5,1), I could go U or L or D, but D is wall, U is occupied, so only L to (4,1).\n\nThen at (4,1), I can go U to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, occupied.\n\nIn positions at (4,1), head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is body, so U to (4,2) occupied.\n\nL to (3,1) obstacle.\n\nD wall.\n\nR to (5,1) body.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied, but if I could eat food to grow, I might not move the tail, so some cells remain occupied, but in this case, I'm not eating food.\n\nSo to survive, I need to eat food soon.\n\nThe only food is at (2,4) and (1,5), both positive.\n\n(2,4) is closer in terms of turns if I can find a path.\n\nFrom current head (6,4), to (2,4), I need to go left, but (5,4) is free, but from there I can only go up to (5,5), then stuck.\n\nUnless after moving to (5,5), some cell becomes free, but in the simulation, all adjacent are occupied.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that the body forms a loop or something, but it's risky.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 60, move D to (6,3), but then from (6,3), I have to go D to (6,2), but at (6,2), I can go nowhere but D.\n\nBut let's list the grid.\n\nLet me sketch the grid at turn 60.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and (3,1).\n\nSnake positions:\n- Head: (6,4)\n- Body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) -- tail\n\nFood: (2,4) and (1,5) but (1,5) occupied.\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,0) to (7,7) minus walls, obstacles, snake.\n\nBut many cells are free, like (0,1), (0,2), etc., but near head, (6,3) is free, (5,4) is free, (7,4) wall, (6,5) body, etc.\n\nFrom (6,4), only (6,3) and (5,4) are free to move.\n\n(5,4) leads to death, (6,3) leads to death in 4 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can, at some point, turn to avoid the obstacle.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), on turn 61, head at (6,2), I can only go D to (6,1), but what if at (6,3), I could do something else, but I can't, only D.\n\nUnless I eat food at some point.\n\nBut there's no food near.\n\nThe food at (2,4) is at (2,4), which is not adjacent to anything I can reach.\n\nFor example, (2,4) is adjacent to (2,3), (2,5), (1,4), (3,4).\n\n(2,3) is not in snake positions, free.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\n(1,4) is body, occupied.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\nBut from current path, I'm going down to (6,1), not towards (2,4).\n\nDistance is 4 in x and 2 in y, but with body in between.\n\nPerhaps I can go left from (6,1) but I can't, only to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) but occupied, or L to (4,1), etc.\n\nAt (5,1), on turn 63, head at (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) -- tail (1,3) removed, so tail (1,2).\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves:\n- U to (5,2): occupied by body (5,2) is in positions\n- D to (5,0): wall, invalid\n- L to (4,1): free, as we moved there\n- R to (6,1): body, occupied\n\nSo only L to (4,1).\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo it seems the snake is forced into a dead end.\n\nBut that can't be; perhaps I missed a move at the beginning.\n\nCurrent direction is D, but at turn 60, I can move L or D, but L leads to immediate death, D leads to death in 4 turns.\n\nBut with D, I have 4 turns, and food life span is 6 for (2,4), so if I can reach it in 4 turns, I can eat it and survive.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (2,4) is 4 cells left, but with body, I can't go directly.\n\nFor example, if I could go left to (5,4), then to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied.\n\nAfter moving, cells become free.\n\nSuppose on turn 60, I move D to (6,3).\n\nThen on turn 61, move D to (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 62, move D to (6,1).\n\nThen on turn 63, move L to (5,1).\n\nThen on turn 64, move L to (4,1), stuck.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can only go to (4,1).\n\nBut at (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) but occupied.\n\nHowever, if on some turn I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the body doesn't shorten, and some cells remain occupied, but that might block or open paths.\n\nFor example, if I eat the food at (2,4) on some turn, the length increases, so the tail stays, and I have more body, which might make it harder to move, but in this case, I'm not near it.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the left side.\n\nAnother idea: from (6,1) on turn 62, head at (6,1), I have to go to (5,1), but from there, instead of going to (4,1), I can go U if possible, but U is occupied.\n\nBut at that point, (5,2) is occupied, but if I wait, it might become free.\n\nBut I have to move each turn.\n\nFor example, on turn 62 at (6,1), I move to (5,1).\n\nThen on turn 63 at (5,1), I move to (4,1).\n\nOn turn 64 at (4,1), no move, die.\n\nBut on turn 64, at (4,1), the only possible move would be U to (4,2), but it's occupied by body.\n\nIn the positions, at that time, (4,2) is a body segment.\n\nIf I could have eaten food earlier, it might be different.\n\nBut the only way is to go for the food at (1,5) when it's free.\n\nOn turn 61, after moving to (6,2), (1,5) is free with food.\n\nHead at (6,2), (1,5) is at distance |6-1| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8 cells away, so at least 8 turns to reach, but food life span 8 at turn 60, on turn 61 it has life span 7, so 7 turns left, but I need 8 turns, so I might not reach it in time.\n\nAt turn 60, food at (1,5) life span 8, so it can be eaten on turns 60 to 67.\n\nOn turn 60, it's occupied, so cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 61, after move, if head can be at (1,5), but head is at (6,2), not there.\n\nThe earliest head can be at (1,5) is when it's free and head moves there.\n\nIt became free on turn 61 (after first move), so on turn 61, it is free, and head can move there if possible.\n\nBut head is at (6,2), far away.\n\nTo move from (6,2) to (1,5), I need to go left and up, but with the body, it's hard.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), I can only move to (6,1), then to (5,1), etc., not towards (1,5).\n\nSo not possible.\n\nSimilarly for (2,4), on turn 60, it's free, head at (6,4), distance 4 left, but I can't go left directly because of the body.\n\nIf I go D to (6,3), then (6,3) to (2,4) is farther.\n\nSo it seems I have no choice but to go down and die in a few turns.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; perhaps I missed a move.\n\nLet's list all possible moves again at turn 60.\n\nHead at (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (6,5): occupied by body and reverse, invalid.\n\nD to (6,3): free, valid.\n\nL to (5,4): free, valid.\n\nR to (7,4): wall, invalid.\n\nSo only D and L.\n\nL leads to immediate death on next turn.\n\nD leads to death in 4 turns.\n\nWith D, I have 4 turns to live, and there is food with life span 6, so if I can eat it within 4 turns, I might survive.\n\nFrom the path, on turn 64, I'm at (4,1), and (2,4) is at (2,4), which is 3 units away in x and 3 in y, but with body, it might be possible if I can navigate.\n\nBut on turn 64 at (4,1), I am stuck, so I can't move to eat.\n\nPerhaps from earlier positions, I can go towards (2,4).\n\nFor example, on turn 63 at (5,1), head at (5,1), I moved to (4,1), but could I move elsewhere?\n\nFrom (5,1), only L to (4,1) possible, as U, D, R all invalid.\n\nU to (5,2) occupied, D wall, R to (6,1) occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nOn turn 62 at (6,1), only D to (6,1) but I moved to (6,1) on turn 62, from (6,2) on turn 61.\n\nAt (6,1), I can only go L to (5,1).\n\nNo other choices.\n\nSo it seems inevitable that the snake dies on turn 64 if I go D, or on turn 61 if I go L.\n\nBut with L, I die sooner, with D, I die later, so better to go D to survive longer and have a chance to eat food if possible.\n\nBut in this case, no chance to eat food.\n\nPerhaps the food at (1,5) can be eaten if the head is near when it's free.\n\nBut head is not near.\n\nAnother thought: the tail reward danger, but it doesn't apply here.\n\nOr perhaps I can move in a way that the body frees up a path.\n\nFor example, if on turn 60 I move D to (6,3), then on turn 61 move D to (6,2), then on turn 62, at (6,1), I move L to (5,1), then on turn 63 at (5,1), I have to move L to (4,1), then on turn 64 at (4,1), I can't move.\n\nBut at (4,1), if I could go U to (4,2), but it's occupied.\n\nHowever, on turn 64, the position of (4,2) might be different.\n\nLet's simulate the positions carefully.\n\nTurn 60: move D to (6,3)\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  -- tail (1,6) removed, so (1,5) tail.\n\nFood at (1,5) is still there, under tail.\n\nTurn 61: move D to (6,2)\n\nNew head (6,2), body: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)  -- tail (1,5) removed, so (1,4) tail.

But I have to move, so on turn 64, when I try to move, I have no valid move, so I die.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for turns where I can move.\n\nPerhaps for turn 64, I can't move, so no action, but the format says to output action for each turn, so I need to specify.\n\nBut in reality, on turn 64, from (4,1), there is no valid move, so I can't choose an action; the game ends.\n\nBut for the sake of the answer, I should output the actions until the last possible move.\n\nOr perhaps assume I move to a cell and die.\n\nBut in the format, I think I output the actions I intend to take.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 64, from (4,1), no valid action, so I can't output an action.\n\nSo perhaps for turn 60 to 63, I have actions, turn 64 no.\n\nBut let's see the turn numbers.\n\nTurn t1=60.\n\nAfter turn 60 move, it's turn 61, etc.\n\nAt turn 63, I move to (5,1), then on turn 64, I am at (5,1), and I need to choose action for turn 64.\n\nFrom (5,1), at turn 64, positions are as above when I was at (5,1) on turn 63, but after move to (5,1), on turn 64, the state is head at (5,1), and body as above.\n\nFrom there, I can only move L to (4,1), which is valid at that time, but after moving to (4,1), I am stuck for the next move.\n\nBut for turn 64 action, I can move L to (4,1), then on turn 65, from (4,1), no move.\n\nSo I can output actions for turn 60 to 64.\n\nTurn 64: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen on turn 65, I die, but I don't need to output turn 65.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so for as many as I can, but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I need to plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn t1=60, so I need to output actions for turn 60,61,62,63,64,65? But I may not survive that long.\n\nIn this case, with D move, I can survive until turn 64 action.\n\nTurn 60: move D\n\nTurn 61: move D\n\nTurn 62: move D\n\nTurn 63: move L\n\nTurn 64: move L\n\nThen on turn 65, from (4,1), no move, die.\n\nBut for turn 64, I output L.\n\nAnd for (2,4) food, it disappears on turn 66, but I can't reach it.\n\nSimilarly for (1,5), on turn 61 it is free, but I'm at (6,2), can't reach.\n\nSo no score increase.\n\nBut perhaps that's the best I can do.\n\nMaybe I can move to (5,4) and hope for a miracle, but it dies immediately.\n\nSo I think moving D is better.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with that.\n\nBut the problem says to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, but in this case, I can't score, so survival is priority.\n\nWith D, I survive 4 more turns, with L, I survive 1 more turn.\n\nSo D is better.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nTurn 64: L\n\nBut on turn 63, when I move L to (5,1), and on turn 64 move L to (4,1), but from (4,1), I can't move further, so for turn 65, I can't output.\n\nBut the 5 turns are turn 60 to 64, that's 5 turns.\n\nTurn t1=60 to t1+4=64, that's 5 actions: 60,61,62,63,64.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I can output that.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nOn turn 63, from (6,1) I move L to (5,1), which is left.\n\nThen on turn 64, from (5,1) move L to (4,1), left again.\n\nAnd for turn 65, I don't output.\n\nSo for the box.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\), the snake must prioritize survival while attempting to eat positive food if possible. After evaluating all possible moves 5+ turns ahead, moving down (D) on turn 60 is the only viable option to avoid immediate death, as moving left (L) leads to a trap on turn 61. The subsequent path is constrained by the snake's body and walls, limiting choices. Although both food items are positive, neither can be reached safely within the food's lifespan or without risking collision, so the plan focuses on maximizing survival turns.\n\n- **Turn 60**: Move D to (6,3). This avoids the immediate trap from moving L and allows the snake to survive longer.\n- **Turn 61**: Move D to (6,2). From (6,3), only down is possible due to body collisions and walls.\n- **Turn 62**: Move D to (6,1). From (6,2), only down is possible.\n- **Turn 63**: Move L to (5,1). From (6,1), only left is possible.\n- **Turn 64**: Move L to (4,1). From (5,1), only left is possible, but this leads to a dead end at (4,1) due to the obstacle at (3,1) and surrounding body segments. No valid move exists on turn 65, resulting in death.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for 5 turns (turns 60-64) with no food eaten, as the food at (2,4) (lifespan 6, disappears after turn 65) and (1,5) (lifespan 8, disappears after turn 67) cannot be reached safely. Moving L on turn 60 would cause death on turn 61, so this path maximizes survival.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 60\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64\\text{: L} }",

        "step": 61,
        "score": 17,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 61. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,3), and the body follows: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That's 18 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nThe head direction is \"D\", which means down. So, moving down would be decreasing y, since y=0 is the bottom? Let me confirm the coordinate system. Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but here it says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is the bottom, and y=7 is the top? But it says walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nHead is at (6,3), direction down, so last move was down, to (6,3) from... let's see the positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), which is above it since y=4 > y=3? y=4 is higher y, so if y increases upwards, (6,4) is above (6,3). But direction is down, so moving from (6,4) to (6,3) would be down, decreasing y. Yes.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (2,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\n(6,3) is the head position? Snake head is at (6,3), and there's food at (6,3)? But food can spawn under the snake's body, and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. Here, the head is already on (6,3), but the food is at (6,3), so it might be under the head.\n\nThe rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nBut in this case, the head is on the food cell now. So, if I move the head away, the body might still be there or not. Let's see.\n\nCurrent position: head at (6,3), which has food. But to eat it, I need the head to move onto it after the body moves away. Since the head is on it now, if I move the head away, the cell might be occupied by the next body segment.\n\nSnake positions: index 0: (6,3) head, index 1: (6,4), which is above, so if head moves, say, left or right, the body will follow, so (6,3) will be occupied by the next segment, which is (6,4) moving to (6,3) when head moves.\n\nBut the food is at (6,3), so if I don't move, I might eat it? But I have to move each turn.\n\nThe rule is: to eat food under the body, the body must move away first, then head moves onto it later.\n\nHere, since head is on it now, and I need to move, if I stay still, I can't, I must move one cell.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,3) with direction down.\n\nCurrent head direction is D (down), so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since last move was down (to here), I cannot move up immediately, because up is opposite to down.\n\nDirections: U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y)\n\nHead direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (6,3), so from (6,4) to (6,3), down.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move up (U) because that would be instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But need to check walls and collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from (6,3):\n\n- Down (D): to (6,2) – y decreases. Is this valid? Walls: y=0 is bottom, so (6,2) is within bounds? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. y=2 is above y=0, so (6,2) is not a wall cell. But is it occupied by body? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nNow, (6,2) is not in this list, so not occupied by body. Also, not a wall. So possible.\n\n- Left (L): to (5,3). x decreases to 5. (5,3) is in snake positions? Yes, (5,3) is the 10th segment? Positions: index 9 is (5,3) if 0-based: head is index 0: (6,3), index 1: (6,4), ..., index 9: (5,3), which is a body segment.\n\n(5,3) is occupied by the snake body, so if I move left to (5,3), it's collision with body, unless it's the tail.\n\nTail is (1,5), so (5,3) is not tail; it's a body segment. Therefore, moving to (5,3) would cause collision and death.\n\nSimilarly, right (R): to (7,3). x=7 is a wall, since border x=7, so moving to (7,3) is wall collision, death.\n\nTherefore, only possible moves are: down (D) to (6,2), or... what about up? Up is invalid because instant reverse not allowed.\n\nPossible actions: D, L, R, but L and R are invalid as above.\n\nL is to (5,3) which is body, R to (7,3) wall.\n\nSo only down (D) to (6,2) is possible? But that seems risky or not?\n\n(6,2) is empty now, but let's see.\n\nFood at (6,3) is under the head. But I need to move, so if I move down to (6,2), the head leaves (6,3), and the next segment, (6,4), moves to (6,3). So (6,3) is now occupied by the body, and food is still there, under the body.\n\nThen, to eat it, I need to move the body away and head back, but that might be tricky.\n\nSince I must move, and only one option: down to (6,2).\n\nBut is that the only option? What about other directions.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction down, so cannot go up.\n\nLeft to (5,3) is body, right to (7,3) wall.\n\nDown to (6,2) is free, as per positions.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions again.\n\nSnake positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n(6,2) not in list, so empty.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (3,1), but (6,2) is not that.\n\nSo only move is down to (6,2).\n\nBut that seems forced. Let me see if I can go left or something.\n\n(5,3) is occupied, yes.\n\nUnless... the tail is moving, but when I move, the tail moves only if I don't eat food.\n\nIn this case, if I move down, head to (6,2), then the body: the segment at (6,4) moves to (6,3), which was head position, and so on, tail at (1,5) moves to where? The second last is (1,4), so tail moves to (1,4)? Let's see the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is left, and if no food eaten, tail disappears.\n\nSo after move down: head to (6,2), then body: position 1 (old (6,4)) moves to (6,3), position 2 (6,5) to (6,4), position 3 (6,6) to (6,5), position 4 (5,6) to (6,6), etc., and tail (1,5) is removed since no growth.\n\nThe food at (6,3) is now under the body at (6,3) after the move.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,4) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is the current tail position? Tail is at (1,5), and there is food at (1,5) with life span 7, value 1.\n\nBut food at (1,5) is under the tail.\n\nNow, for the head, I have to move down to (6,2), since no other choice.\n\nThen on turn 61, action is D.\n\nThen for future turns, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut the question is to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 61.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn 61, 62, etc., for 5+ turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the sequence starting from current turn.\n\nIn the boxed, it says Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nSo for turn 61, I must choose an action, which seems to be only D.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other options.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction down, so cannot go up.\n\nLeft to (5,3): (5,3) is in snake positions, it's the segment before (5,2), etc., not tail.\n\nTail is (1,5), so (5,3) is occupied, so if I move there, head collides with body.\n\nSimilarly, right to (7,3): x=7 is wall.\n\nDown to (6,2): y=2, not wall, not occupied.\n\nBut is there a wall at y=0, but y=2 is fine.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant.\n\nSo yes, only possible move is down to (6,2).\n\nSo for turn 61, action must be D.\n\nThen after move, head at (6,2), body: the segment that was at (6,4) is now at (6,3), and so on, tail (1,5) is removed, so new tail is at (1,4)? Let's list new positions after move down.\n\nCurrent positions before move: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nAfter move down: head to (6,2)\n\nThen body segments: segment 1 (index 1, old (6,4)) moves to head old position (6,3)\n\nSegment 2 (old (6,5)) to old seg1 position (6,4)\n\nSegment 3 (old (6,6)) to (6,5)\n\nSegment 4 (old (5,6)) to (6,6)\n\nSegment 5 (old (4,6)) to (5,6)\n\nSegment 6 (old (4,5)) to (4,6)\n\nSegment 7 (old (4,4)) to (4,5)\n\nSegment 8 (old (4,3)) to (4,4)\n\nSegment 9 (old (5,3)) to (4,3)\n\nSegment 10 (old (5,2)) to (5,3)\n\nSegment 11 (old (4,2)) to (5,2)\n\nSegment 12 (old (3,2)) to (4,2)\n\nSegment 13 (old (2,2)) to (3,2)\n\nSegment 14 (old (1,2)) to (2,2)\n\nSegment 15 (old (1,3)) to (1,2)\n\nSegment 16 (old (1,4)) to (1,3)\n\nSegment 17 (old (1,5)) to (1,4)\n\nAnd tail old (1,5) is gone, so new tail is at (1,4).\n\nNew snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) — that's 18 segments, but tail removed, so 17 segments? Original 18 positions, after move no food eaten, so length decreases? No.\n\nOriginal positions: 18 segments, head + 17 body? List has 18 elements: index 0 to 17.\n\nAfter move: head to new position, each body moves to previous position of predecessor, so the last position (tail) is not occupied anymore, so snake has 17 segments now.\n\nNew positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) — that's 18 positions? (6,2) head, then 17 body, but when moving, the tail is removed, so only 17 segments.\n\nFor example, with 3 segments: head, body, tail. After move, head to new, body to old head, tail removed, so new is head and body only, 2 segments.\n\nSimilarly here, original 18 segments, after move no eat, 17 segments.\n\nPositions: head at (6,2), then body at (6,3) (old head), (6,4) (old seg1), ..., up to (1,4) which is old (1,5) position? Old positions: seg16 was (1,4), seg17 was (1,5).\n\nAfter move: new seg1 is old head (6,3), new seg2 is old seg1 (6,4), ..., new seg16 is old seg16 (1,4)? Let's index.\n\nOld positions: idx0: (6,3), idx1: (6,4), idx2: (6,5), idx3: (6,6), idx4: (5,6), idx5: (4,6), idx6: (4,5), idx7: (4,4), idx8: (4,3), idx9: (5,3), idx10: (5,2), idx11: (4,2), idx12: (3,2), idx13: (2,2), idx14: (1,2), idx15: (1,3), idx16: (1,4), idx17: (1,5)\n\nAfter move down: head to (6,2)\n\nThen new idx1: old idx0 (6,3)\n\nnew idx2: old idx1 (6,4)\n\nnew idx3: old idx2 (6,5)\n\nnew idx4: old idx3 (6,6)\n\nnew idx5: old idx4 (5,6)\n\nnew idx6: old idx5 (4,6)\n\nnew idx7: old idx6 (4,5)\n\nnew idx8: old idx7 (4,4)\n\nnew idx9: old idx8 (4,3)\n\nnew idx10: old idx9 (5,3)\n\nnew idx11: old idx10 (5,2)\n\nnew idx12: old idx11 (4,2)\n\nnew idx13: old idx12 (3,2)\n\nnew idx14: old idx13 (2,2)\n\nnew idx15: old idx14 (1,2)\n\nnew idx16: old idx15 (1,3)\n\nnew idx17: old idx16 (1,4)\n\nOld idx17 (1,5) is not in new positions, so new snake has 17 segments: from (6,2) to (1,4).\n\nNew head at (6,2), direction is down, since I moved down.\n\nNow, food: food at (2,4) with life span 5, but after one turn, life span decreases, so on turn 62, it will be 4, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) with life span 7, but (1,5) was the tail, and we moved, so now (1,5) is empty? But food is there.\n\nFood at (1,5) is still there, but not eaten because head didn't move onto it; it was under tail.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,3) is now under new position (6,3), which is a body segment.\n\nAnd food at (2,4).\n\nNow, for turn 62, head at (6,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since last move was down, cannot move up (U).\n\nSo possible: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\n- Down (D) to (6,1): y=1, not wall. Is it occupied? New snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), ..., (1,4). (6,1) not in list, so free.\n\n- Left (L) to (5,2): (5,2) is in positions? new idx11 is (5,2)? New positions: head (6,2), idx1 (6,3), idx2 (6,4), ..., idx10 (5,3)? List: new idx10 is old idx9 (5,3), new idx11 is old idx10 (5,2), so (5,2) is occupied by body segment.\n\nMoving to (5,2) would collide with body.\n\n- Right (R) to (7,2): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, forced down.\n\nThen turn 62: D to (6,1).\n\nAfter that, head at (6,1), direction down.\n\nThen turn 63: possible moves from (6,1).\n\nDown to (6,0): y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nLeft to (5,1): not occupied? Snake positions after previous move.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think multiple turns.\n\nBut currently, from (6,2), only down to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), down to (6,0) is wall, so cannot.\n\nOther moves: since direction down, cannot move up.\n\nLeft to (5,1): let's see if occupied.\n\nAfter turn 61 move: snake at (6,2), (6,3), ..., (1,4)\n\nAfter turn 62 move down to (6,1): head to (6,1), then body: new idx1 to (6,2), idx2 to (6,3), ..., up to new tail.\n\nOld tail was (1,4), so new positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) — and (1,4) removed, so 17 segments? Similar.\n\nPositions include (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n\n(5,1) not in positions, so free.\n\nAlso, no wall at (5,1).\n\nRight to (7,1) wall.\n\nUp is invalid because instant reverse from down.\n\nSo from (6,1), possible moves: down to (6,0) wall, invalid; left to (5,1) free; right to (7,1) wall; up invalid.\n\nSo only left to (5,1) is possible.\n\nThen turn 63: L to (5,1).\n\nNow, head at (5,1), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNow, food: we have food at (2,4), (1,5), and (6,3) but (6,3) is under body.\n\nAlso, life span decreasing.\n\n(2,4) life span was 5 on turn 61, so on turn 62:4, turn 63:3, etc.\n\n(1,5) life span 7 on turn 61, turn 62:6, turn 63:5, etc.\n\n(6,3) life span 10 on turn 61, turn 62:9, turn 63:8, etc.\n\nNow, from (5,1), head direction L, so last move left.\n\nCannot move right (instant reverse).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\n- Left (L) to (4,1): not occupied? Current snake positions after turn 62 move: let's assume after turn 62, head at (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), ..., (1,3) as above.\n\nAfter move to (5,1) on turn 63: head to (5,1), then body: new idx1 to old head (6,1), new idx2 to old idx1 (6,2), etc.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) — and (1,4) removed? After turn 62, positions were 17 segments, after turn 63 move, no eat, 16 segments.\n\nBut (4,1) is free, no wall.\n\n- Up (U) to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied? In new positions after turn 62, (5,2) is a body segment, e.g., idx13 or something. After turn 62: positions include (5,2), yes, it's there.\n\nAfter turn 62 move to (6,1), positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), ..., (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n\n(5,2) is a body cell, so moving up to (5,2) from (5,1) would collide.\n\n- Down (D) to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Right (R) invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (4,1).\n\nL to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is not wall, not occupied.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), but (4,1) is different.\n\nSo turn 63: L to (4,1).\n\nHead at (4,1), direction left.\n\nThen turn 64: from (4,1), direction L, cannot move right.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\n- Left (L) to (3,1): but (3,1) is internal obstacle! Wall at (3,1), so invalid.\n\n- Up (U) to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied? Current positions after turn 63: head at (4,1), body at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), etc. (4,2) is a body segment, e.g., after turn 63 move, positions include (4,2) as a body cell.\n\nAfter turn 63 move to (4,1): head to (4,1), body: new idx1 to (5,1), new idx2 to (6,1), new idx3 to (6,2), new idx4 to (6,3), ..., and (4,2) might be there.\n\nLet's list: after turn 62: positions (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nAfter move to (4,1) on turn 63: head to (4,1), then body: new idx1 to old head (6,1)? No, new idx1 to position of old head, which is (6,1) from turn 62.\n\nAfter turn 62, head at (6,1), so new idx1 to (6,1), new idx2 to old idx1, which was (6,2), new idx3 to old idx2 (6,3), ..., up to new idx17 to old idx16 (1,3)? Old positions after turn 62: 17 segments, head (6,1), then idx1 (6,2), idx2 (6,3), ..., idx16 (1,3)\n\nAfter move to (4,1): new head (4,1), new idx1: old head (6,1), new idx2: old idx1 (6,2), new idx3: old idx2 (6,3), ..., new idx16: old idx15 (1,2), new idx17: old idx16 (1,3)? But old idx16 is (1,3), and old idx15 is (1,2), etc.\n\nSince no eat, tail removed, so only 16 segments: head (4,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) — and (1,3) removed.\n\n(4,2) is in positions, it's the second last or something.\n\n(4,2) is occupied.\n\nSo from (4,1), moving up to (4,2) is to a body cell, collision.\n\nDown to (4,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (3,1): wall, invalid.\n\nRight invalid.\n\nNo possible moves? But that can't be, I must have a move.\n\nU to (4,2) is occupied, D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) wall, R invalid.\n\nStuck!\n\nBut on turn 63, I moved to (4,1), which is above (4,0) and below (4,2), but (4,2) occupied.\n\nBut in the grid, are there other cells? (4,1) can also move to (3,1) or (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied by body.\n\nAfter turn 63 move, positions include (5,1) as new idx1.\n\nFrom (4,1), adjacent cells: (4,2) up, (4,0) down, (3,1) left, (5,1) right.\n\n(4,2) occupied, (4,0) wall, (3,1) wall, (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo indeed, no valid move, snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be right for the game; I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet's go back to the beginning.\n\nOn turn 61, head at (6,3), only move down to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 62, from (6,2), only down to (6,1).\n\nThen turn 63, from (6,1), only left to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 64, from (5,1), to where? After moving to (5,1) on turn 63, let's list positions.\n\nAfter turn 62: head at (6,1), positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)  -- 18 positions? No, after turn 61 move, 17 segments, after turn 62 move no eat, 16 segments.\n\nAfter turn 61 move: 17 segments\n\nAfter turn 62 move down to (6,1): head to (6,1), body new idx1 to old head (6,2), new idx2 to old idx1 (6,3), ..., new idx16 to old idx15 (1,3), new idx17 to old idx16 (1,4)? Old positions after turn 61: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) -- that's 18 positions for 17 segments? Head and 16 body, so 17 positions.\n\nAfter turn 61: positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) -- 18 positions, but that's head + 17 body? No, in snake positions, the list includes head and all body segments. For a snake of length L, there are L positions.\n\nOriginal: 18 positions, length 18.\n\nAfter move no eat, length 17, so 17 positions.\n\nAfter turn 61 move to (6,2): positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) -- this has 18 elements, but (1,4) is the last, and old tail (1,5) removed, so it should be 17 positions: from (6,2) to (1,4), but (1,4) is included, so 18 positions for 17 segments? I think I have an off-by-one error.\n\nLet's count: indices 0 to 17 for 18 positions.\n\nAfter move, new head position, then new body positions from old head to old second last.\n\nOld positions: idx0 to idx17.\n\nNew head: new position\n\nNew body 1: old idx0\n\nNew body 2: old idx1\n\n...\n\nNew body 17: old idx16\n\nOld idx17 is not used, so new positions are new head + old idx0 to old idx16, that's 18 positions for new snake? No.\n\nFor example, with 3 segments: old: H, B, T\n\nAfter move, new head to new cell, new body1 to old H, new body2 to old B, and old T removed, so new positions: new head, old H, old B. Length 3 if no eat, but if no eat, length decreases to 2? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so the snake occupies the same number of cells, but the tail cell is vacated.\n\nPositions: the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last body segment (tail) moves to the position of the second last, and the old tail position is empty.\n\nSo the number of positions remains the same, but the snake shifts.\n\nIn terms of list, the new position list has the same length, with head new, and each subsequent is the previous position of the one before.\n\nSo for length L, after move no eat, still L positions, but the last one is new.\n\nIn this case, original 18 positions.\n\nAfter move down on turn 61: new head at (6,2), new pos1 at old head (6,3), new pos2 at old pos1 (6,4), ..., new pos17 at old pos16 (1,4), and old pos17 (1,5) is gone.\n\nSo new positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) -- still 18 positions, but the last is (1,4), which was previously (1,4) in old, but now it's the tail, and (1,5) removed.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 62 move down to (6,1): new head (6,1), new pos1 (6,2), new pos2 (6,3), new pos3 (6,4), new pos4 (6,5), new pos5 (6,6), new pos6 (5,6), new pos7 (4,6), new pos8 (4,5), new pos9 (4,4), new pos10 (4,3), new pos11 (5,3), new pos12 (5,2), new pos13 (4,2), new pos14 (3,2), new pos15 (2,2), new pos16 (1,2), new pos17 (1,3) -- and (1,4) removed.\n\nSo positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) -- 18 positions.\n\nThen after turn 63 move left to (5,1): from (6,1) to (5,1), direction left.\n\nNew head (5,1), new pos1 (6,1), new pos2 (6,2), new pos3 (6,3), new pos4 (6,4), new pos5 (6,5), new pos6 (6,6), new pos7 (5,6), new pos8 (4,6), new pos9 (4,5), new pos10 (4,4), new pos11 (4,3), new pos12 (5,3), new pos13 (5,2), new pos14 (4,2), new pos15 (3,2), new pos16 (2,2), new pos17 (1,2) -- and (1,3) removed.\n\nSo positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n\nNow turn 64, head at (5,1), direction left (last move left).\n\nCannot move right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up (U) to (5,2): (5,2) is in positions, new pos13 is (5,2), body segment, so occupied, collision if move there.\n\n- Down (D) to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Left (L) to (4,1): (4,1) not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\n- Right (R) invalid.\n\nSo left to (4,1) is possible.\n\nThen turn 64: L to (4,1).\n\nHead at (4,1), direction left.\n\nThen turn 65, from (4,1), direction L, cannot move right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up (U) to (4,2): (4,2) is in positions, new pos15 is (4,2), body segment, occupied.\n\n- Down (D) to (4,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Left (L) to (3,1): but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\n- Right (R) invalid.\n\nSo no valid move! Snake dies on turn 65.\n\nBut this is bad; I need to avoid this.\n\nThe problem is that by moving down twice and then left, I trapped myself.\n\nOn turn 61, I had to move down, no choice.\n\nTurn 62, down again, no choice.\n\nTurn 63, from (6,1), I moved left to (5,1), but was there another option?\n\nFrom (6,1), direction down, so cannot move up.\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,0) wall, invalid; L to (5,1) free; R to (7,1) wall; U invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,1).\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo this path leads to death on turn 65.\n\nBut perhaps I can eat food to grow and avoid this.\n\nFor example, on turn 61, there is food at (6,3) under head, but I can't eat it because I need to move away and come back, but I can't stay.\n\nOr food at (1,5), which is the tail.\n\nOn turn 61, tail is at (1,5), with food.\n\nIf I can move the head to eat that food when it's accessible.\n\nBut (1,5) is far away.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,4).\n\nBut currently, I'm at (6,3), and I have to move down to (6,2), etc.\n\nPerhaps after moving down, I can go left or something.\n\nBut on turn 61, only down is possible.\n\nThen on turn 62, from (6,2), only down to (6,1).\n\nThen on turn 63, from (6,1), only left to (5,1).\n\nThen on turn 64, from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1), then on turn 65 from (4,1) no move, death.\n\nUnless I can eat food somewhere.\n\nFor example, on turn 63 at (6,1), I moved to (5,1), but (5,1) might have food? No food listed there.\n\nFood at (2,4), (1,5), (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is under body at that point.\n\nPerhaps I can move to eat the food at (2,4).\n\nBut I'm at (6,1) on turn 63, (2,4) is far.\n\nLife span of (2,4) is 5 on turn 61, so on turn 63, life span 3, will disappear after 3 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 7 on 61, turn 63:5.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,3) is under the body at (6,3) after turn 61.\n\nIf I can move the body away and head back, but with the snake shape, it's difficult.\n\nPerhaps I can go up from somewhere.\n\nBut on turn 61, I have to go down.\n\nLet's list all cells to see the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls at borders and (3,1).\n\nSnake positions on turn 61: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nFood at (2,4), (1,5), (6,3)\n\n(1,5) is tail, so food under tail.\n\n(6,3) is head, food under head.\n\nFor turn 61, only move down to (6,2).\n\nThen after that, head at (6,2), and food at (6,3) is now under the body at (6,3).\n\nOn turn 62, from (6,2), only move down to (6,1).\n\nHead at (6,1), direction down.\n\nOn turn 63, from (6,1), only move left to (5,1).\n\nHead at (5,1), direction left.\n\nOn turn 64, from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1), or up to (5,2) but occupied, or down wall.\n\nSo only left to (4,1).\n\nHead at (4,1), direction left.\n\nOn turn 65, from (4,1), no move, as before.\n\nBut (4,1) can move to (4,2) but occupied, or (3,1) wall, or (4,0) wall, or (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo death.\n\nUnless on turn 64, from (5,1), I can move up or down, but up to (5,2) is occupied, down to (5,0) wall, so only left.\n\nSo it seems inevitable that I die on turn 65.\n\nBut that can't be; perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother possibility: the food at (1,5) is under the tail on turn 61.\n\nIf I can move the tail away and head to it.\n\nBut tail is at (1,5), head at (6,3), far away.\n\nBy the time I move, the tail moves.\n\nFor example, on turn 61, after move down, tail is at (1,4), food at (1,5) is still there.\n\nOn turn 62, after move down, tail at (1,3), food at (1,5).\n\nOn turn 63, after move to (5,1), tail at (1,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,5) is not near head.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,4) is at (2,4), which might be accessible.\n\nOn turn 61, (2,4) is not occupied, but head at (6,3), far.\n\nAfter a few moves, head at (6,1) or (5,1), still far from (2,4).\n\nFor example, from (5,1) on turn 63, (2,4) is at distance, but I have to move to (4,1) on turn 64, then stuck.\n\nSo I think the snake is doomed to die in a few turns with the current path.\n\nBut perhaps on turn 61, there is a way to avoid this.\n\nOn turn 61, head at (6,3), direction down, only move down to (6,2).\n\nNo other choice.\n\nUnless... the food at (6,3) is under head, and if I could eat it without moving, but I have to move.\n\nOr perhaps the rule allows eating if head is on it, but the rule says \"can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it\", so when head is on it, if I move away, I don't eat it.\n\nSo on turn 61, if I move down, I don't eat the food.\n\nBut the food is still there under the body.\n\nThen later, if the body moves away and head comes back, I can eat.\n\nBut in this case, the body at (6,3) might move.\n\nFor example, after turn 61, body at (6,3).\n\nAfter turn 62, when head moves to (6,1), the body at (6,3) moves to (6,2), so (6,3) is vacated, and food is there, so (6,3) has food and is empty.\n\nThen on turn 63, head at (6,1), I moved to (5,1), but from (6,1), I could have moved up? But direction down, cannot move up.\n\nFrom (6,1), only left to (5,1), not up.\n\nSo I couldn't go to (6,2) which is body, or (6,0) wall.\n\nSo no way to go to (6,3) from there.\n\nOn turn 63, from (6,1), (6,3) is two cells away.\n\nNot reachable directly.\n\nSo I think the snake will die soon.\n\nBut the game must have a way; perhaps I misread the initial state.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,5) is under the tail, and there is a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nTail at (1,5), head at (6,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for turn 61, since food is at head, and I move, I don't eat it, but maybe the game allows eating if head is on food, but the rule says otherwise.\n\nThe rule: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo when head is on it, if the body is also on it or something, but here, on turn 61, head is on (6,3), and it's the only segment there? No, the body segments are at different positions, so the cell (6,3) has only head, not body.\n\nThe body segments are at different cells.\n\nSo (6,3) has only the head, and food is there, so perhaps I can eat it by not moving, but I have to move each turn.\n\nThe rule doesn't say that if head is on food, it is eaten immediately; it says the conditions for eating food under body, but for food under head, it might be different.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nIt says \"under the snake's body\", so for food under the head, it might be eatable directly.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify food under head.\n\nIn the special cases, it says \"food can spawn under the snake's body\", implying that body includes head or not?\n\nTypically, \"body\" might exclude head, but in snake games, head is part of the snake.\n\nLet's see the rule: \"the snake's body\" – in the context, \"body\" might mean non-head segments.\n\nFor example, \"the body moves away\" suggests body segments.\n\nAlso, in the tail reward danger, it says \"tail cell\", so tail is separate.\n\nSo for food under the head, since head is not \"body\", it might be eatable when head is on it.\n\nBut the rule doesn't say.\n\nLet's assume that if food is under the head, it can be eaten when the head is on it, but since I have to move, I need to stay to eat, but I can't stay, I must move.\n\nSo probably, on the turn the head is on food, if I don't move, but I have to move, so I can't eat it if I move away.\n\nPerhaps when I move, if the head was on food, I eat it during the move or something.\n\nThe rule is ambiguous.\n\nTo be safe, let's assume that for food under head, it can be eaten only if I stay, but I can't, so I have to move away.\n\nIn this case, on turn 61, I move down to (6,2), not eating the food.\n\nThen the food remains at (6,3) under the body that moves there.\n\nLater, if I can return.\n\nBut in this case, I can't.\n\nPerhaps on turn 61, there is another move I can make.\n\nBut from (6,3), direction down, only down is possible, as L and R are invalid.\n\nUnless I can move to a cell that is the tail, but (5,3) is not tail, it's body.\n\nTail is (1,5), far.\n\nSo I think I have to accept that for turn 61, action is D.\n\nThen for turn 62, D.\n\nTurn 63, L to (5,1).\n\nTurn 64, L to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 65, from (4,1), no move, so the game ends, but for the answer, I need to provide actions until I die or for 5 turns.\n\nBut the instruction is to maximize score and survive, so I need to find a way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps on turn 63, from (6,1), I moved to (5,1), but (5,1) is free, but maybe I can go to other cells, but no, only (5,1) is possible.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to the tail cell if it's adjacent, but here not.\n\nLet's list the grid state on turn 61.\n\nGrid:\n\n- Walls: borders and (3,1)\n\n- Snake: (6,3) head, then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail\n\n- Food: (2,4), (1,5), (6,3)\n\n(1,5) is both food and tail, (6,3) is both food and head.\n\nFor (6,3), since head is on it, and I move, if I move down to (6,2), I don't eat it, and it becomes under body at (6,3) after move.\n\nSimilarly for (1,5), under tail.\n\nNow, for turn 61, I have to move D to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 62, from (6,2), only D to (6,1).\n\nThen turn 63, from (6,1), only L to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 64, from (5,1), only L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 65, from (4,1), no move, so I can't provide an action, but for the answer, I can list up to turn 64.\n\nBut for turn 65, it's invalid.\n\nPerhaps from (4,1), I can move to (4,2) but it's occupied, so collision.\n\nSo on turn 65, if I \"move\" to (4,2), I die.\n\nSimilarly, any move causes death.\n\nSo for the sequence, I can list up to turn 64.\n\nBut let's see if on turn 64, from (5,1), I can do something else.\n\nFrom (5,1), direction left, so I can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (5,2): occupied by body (5,2) is in positions.\n\nD to (5,0): wall.\n\nL to (4,1): free.\n\nSo only L.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo I think for the answer, I have to output the actions as per the only possible moves.\n\nFor turn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nTurn 64: L\n\nThen on turn 65, death.\n\nFor the boxed answer, I can list from turn 61 to 64.\n\nBut the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so for 5 turns, but from turn 61 to 65 is 5 actions? Turn 61,62,63,64,65.\n\nBut on turn 65, no valid action.\n\nPerhaps I can include turn 65 as a move that causes death, but I need to specify the action.\n\nBut there is no safe action.\n\nSo maybe list up to turn 64.\n\nBut let's assume that for turn 65, I have to choose an action, say U to (4,2), but it causes collision.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to provide the action.\n\nPerhaps for this state, it's a losing position, and I have to play it out.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (1,5) has life span 7, on turn 61, and it's under tail, so when the tail moves, it reveals the food.\n\nOn turn 61 after move, tail moves to (1,4), so (1,5) is empty with food.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 62, tail to (1,3), (1,4) empty, etc.\n\nBut head is at (6,1) on turn 62, far from (1,5).\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can go towards (2,4) after moving down.\n\nFor example, after turn 62, head at (6,1), I moved left to (5,1), but instead, I have to.\n\nFrom (6,1), only left.\n\nSo I think I have to accept the sequence.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 61: D\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nTurn 64: L\n\nThen for turn 65, since no safe move, but I can say U or something, but it dies.\n\nBut to be precise, let's list for 4 turns.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, so perhaps I need to plan for survival.\n\nPerhaps on turn 61, I can move in a way that allows eating the food at (6,3) later.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (6,2), then on turn 62, from (6,2), if I could move up to (6,3), but direction is down, so I cannot move up, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo from (6,2), last move down, cannot move up.\n\nSo I can't go back to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, only down to (6,1).\n\nSo no way.\n\nI think I have to go with the only possible moves.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: D\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: L\nTurn 64: L\n}\n\nThen on turn 65, the snake dies when it moves or has no move.\n\nBut since the format requires actions, I can stop at turn 64 for 4 turns, or include turn 65 with a move that causes death.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll list up to turn 64.\n\nPerhaps for turn 65, from (4,1), I can move to (4,2) and die, but I'll not include it.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the internal obstacle at (3,1) is not a wall for the whole row, but it's a cell, so moving to (3,1) is invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Strategy\n\nThe current state (turn 61) presents a challenging situation due to the snake's position and movement constraints. The snake is trapped in a narrow path with limited safe moves, and the available food is either under the body or far from the head. The primary goal is to maximize long-term survival and score, but the immediate priority is to avoid collisions and extend life as much as possible.\n\n#### Key Constraints and Risks:\n- **Movement Limitations**: \n  - At turn 61, head is at (6,3) with direction \"D\" (down). Due to \"no instant reverse,\" moving up (U) is invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (5,3) is occupied by the body (segment at index 9), causing collision.\n  - Right (R) to (7,3) is a wall (x=7 border).\n  - Only valid move is down (D) to (6,2), which is safe (not wall or body).\n- **Food Considerations**:\n  - Food at (6,3) is under the head but cannot be eaten this turn because the head must move away (rule: food under body/head requires body to move away first and head to return later). Moving down forfeits this food opportunity.\n  - Food at (1,5) is under the tail and far from the head; it cannot be eaten immediately.\n  - Food at (2,4) has a life span of 5 (down to 4 on turn 62), but the head is moving away from it.\n- **Trajectory and Survival**:\n  - After moving down to (6,2) on turn 61, the only safe move on turn 62 is down to (6,1) (similar constraints: no reverse, left/right invalid).\n  - On turn 63, from (6,1), only left to (5,1) is safe.\n  - On turn 64, from (5,1), only left to (4,1) is safe.\n  - By turn 65, from (4,1), no safe moves exist:\n    - Up to (4,2) is occupied by body.\n    - Down to (4,0) is a wall.\n    - Left to (3,1) is a wall (internal obstacle).\n    - Right to (5,1) is occupied by body or invalid due to direction.\n  - This path leads to inevitable death on turn 65. No alternative routes or food can be accessed in time to avoid this due to the snake's length and position.\n\n#### Strategy for 5+ Turns:\n- **Short-Term (Turns 61-64)**: Execute the only safe moves to delay death. No food can be eaten during this sequence due to the path constraints and food locations.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Not feasible here. The snake is in a \"dead end\" by turn 64, with no escape. Thinking 5 turns ahead (to turn 66) is impossible as the snake will collide on turn 65.\n- **Prioritize Survival**: The sequence below maximizes survival to turn 64, but the snake cannot survive to turn 65 or beyond. No positive food can be eaten in the next 4 turns.\n\n#### Action Sequence:\nThe only safe actions are:\n- Turn 61: Move down (D) to (6,2).\n- Turn 62: Move down (D) to (6,1).\n- Turn 63: Move left (L) to (5,1).\n- Turn 64: Move left (L) to (4,1).\n\nOn turn 65, no valid action exists, and any move (e.g., up to (4,2)) causes collision. Thus, the sequence ends at turn 64.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: D\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: L\nTurn 64: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 62, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So the tail is at (1,4). The head direction is down, which means it was moving downward to reach (6,2). Since it's moving down, the y-coordinate decreases when moving down? Let me clarify the coordinate system.\n\nIn the movement constraints, it says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases upward, decreases downward. That means (6,2) is the head, and since direction is D (down), it came from (6,3) or something. Let's list the positions in order:\n\nSnake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]\n\nThe head is (6,2), and it's moving down. Moving down to (6,2) from where? The previous position before head should be where it was. The list is head first, so (6,2) is current head, and it moved to (6,2) from (6,3)? But (6,3) is the second position, which is the body. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail follows, so the previous head position becomes the neck, and so on.\n\nAt turn 62, head is at (6,2), and it was at (6,3) in the previous turn? Let's see the sequence. Positions: index 0: (6,2) head, index 1: (6,3), index 2: (6,4), etc.\n\nSince head direction is D, down, that means from the previous position, it moved down to (6,2). Previous head position must have been (6,3), because moving down from (6,3) to (6,2) decreases y by 1. (6,3) to (6,2) is down, yes.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,4) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\n(6,3) is also a snake body position. Specifically, (6,3) is the second segment in the snake positions list.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly y from 1 to 6? But internal obstacle at (3,1), which is within that.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns x=1 to x=6 are free, but x=0 and x=7 are out of bounds. Similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n\nBut (3,1): x=3, y=1, which is on the bottom row? y=1 is above y=0? Coordinate system: y=0 is bottom or top? Movement: U (x,y+1) increases y, so y increases upward, so y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top wall? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (6,2)\n\nBody: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nTail is (1,4)\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (2,4): value +1, life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 62, life span 4, so it will be gone by turn 65? Let's see: at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, so if not eaten, it lasts for N more turns including current? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, for food at (2,4) with life span 4 on turn 62, after turn 62, life span becomes 3, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when life span >0. On turn 62, life span 4, so it can be eaten from turn 62 to turn 65, and disappears after turn 65 or at the start of turn 66? Typically, it should be available until the end of its life span turn.\n\nBut for planning, since we move and eat on the same turn, if head moves to food cell on turn t, it eats it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 6, so available until turn 67? Turn 62 + 6 - 1 = 67? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N on turn t, it decreases to N-1 after turn t, so on turn t, it is present, and can be eaten. After turn t, if not eaten, life span N-1. So it is present for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn t + N.\n\nFor (2,4) at turn 62, life span 4: available on turns 62,63,64,65; disappears at turn 66.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 6: available turns 62 to 67.\n\n(6,3) life span 9: available turns 62 to 70.\n\nNow, (6,3) is occupied by the snake body. Specifically, it's the second segment.\n\nFood can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. So for (6,3), since it's under the snake, we need the snake to move so that (6,3) is vacated, then head can move to it later.\n\nBut currently, head is at (6,2), moving down. Possible moves: since head direction is D (down), and no instant reverse, so cannot move up (opposite of down). So possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right), but not U.\n\nNow, current position: (6,2)\n\nMove down: to (6,1) — but y=1, is that within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is the bottom row, above y=0 wall. y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable, except obstacles.\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, but (6,1) is free? Let's see the area.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1) obstacle.\n\n(6,1): x=6, y=1, not obstacle, not wall, so should be free, unless occupied by snake.\n\nIs (6,1) occupied? Snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), etc., no (6,1), so (6,1) is free.\n\nBut moving down to (6,1): y=1, which is above y=0 wall, so it's valid.\n\nMove left: from (6,2) to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,2) is in the list, index 11: (5,2)\n\nList: positions: 0:(6,2) head, 1:(6,3), 2:(6,4), 3:(6,5), 4:(6,6), 5:(5,6), 6:(4,6), 7:(4,5), 8:(4,4), 9:(4,3), 10:(5,3), 11:(5,2), 12:(4,2), 13:(3,2), 14:(2,2), 15:(1,2), 16:(1,3), 17:(1,4) tail.\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied by the 11th segment, so it's part of the body. Moving to (5,2) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n\nBut the rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail will move.\n\nIn this case, (5,2) is not the tail; tail is (1,4). So moving to (5,2) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, move right: from (6,2) to (7,2), but x=7 is wall, so invalid, collision with wall.\n\nx=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n\nMove up: but direction is D, moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: only down and left? Down to (6,1) or left to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied.\n\nLeft to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nWhat about other moves? Only three possible directions, but one is reverse, forbidden, one is wall, one is body collision.\n\nDown to (6,1): is (6,1) free? Yes, not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nBut y=1, and walls at y=0, so (6,1) should be playable.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (3,1) obstacle.\n\n(6,1): x=6, y=1, not (3,1), so free.\n\nAnd not in snake positions.\n\nSo moving down to (6,1) is possible.\n\nBut is there another option? Left to (5,2) is occupied, right to (7,2) wall, up forbidden.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (6,1)? That seems dangerous because we're going to the edge.\n\nBut let's think about the food and planning ahead.\n\nAlso, for (6,3) food, it's under the snake body, so we need to vacate it first.\n\nBut for now, at turn 62, head at (6,2), only possible move is down to (6,1).\n\nBut let's double-check the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions include (5,2), which is a body segment. After moving, the snake will move: head to new position, tail moves or grows if food eaten.\n\nBut at this turn, no food eaten yet, so if we move to (6,1), head moves to (6,1), then the body: the segment at (6,2) becomes new neck, and so on, tail at (1,4) moves off, so the cell (1,4) is vacated.\n\nBut for (5,2), it will still be occupied until the snake moves.\n\nIf we move left to (5,2), (5,2) is currently occupied by body, so when head moves to (5,2), it would be on the same cell as body segment, causing collision.\n\nUnless it's the tail, but tail is (1,4), not (5,2).\n\nSo yes, moving to (5,2) causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, right to (7,2) wall.\n\nUp to (6,3) but (6,3) is also occupied by body, and moving up is reverse, forbidden anyway.\n\nSo only down to (6,1) is possible.\n\nBut is (6,1) safe? After moving, the snake will be at positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), etc., down to tail.\n\n(6,1) is free, so no collision.\n\nBut we're at the bottom row, y=1, which might be risky for future moves.\n\nNow, let's think about the food.\n\nFood at (2,4), (1,5), and (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is currently under snake body, so we need to move the snake so that (6,3) is vacated.\n\nCurrently, at turn 62, after moving down to (6,1), the new snake positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), ..., up to tail (1,4).\n\n(6,3) is still occupied, but there is food there with life span 9, so it will be under body until we move away.\n\nSince we moved down, the body segments shift: the old head (6,2) is now the first body segment, (6,3) is second, etc. So (6,3) is still occupied by snake.\n\nTo eat the food at (6,3), we need to move the snake so that (6,3) is no longer occupied, then head can move to it.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nNow, let's consider the map for planning.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions turn 62:\n\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nSo let's list occupied cells:\n\n- Row y=6: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)\n\n- y=5: (6,5), (4,5)\n\n- y=4: (6,4), (4,4), (1,4) tail\n\n- y=3: (6,3), (4,3), (5,3), (1,3)\n\n- y=2: (6,2) head, (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n\n- y=1: no snake, except obstacle at (3,1)\n\nFood:\n\n(2,4) - positive, life 4\n\n(1,5) - positive, life 6\n\n(6,3) - positive, life 9, but under snake body at (6,3)\n\nAt turn 62, head at (6,2), only move possible is down to (6,1).\n\nSo for turn 62, action must be D (down).\n\nThen new position: head at (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), and tail (1,4) moves off? When head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so the new tail is the previous second last segment.\n\nAfter move: head to (6,1), then the old head (6,2) becomes first body, old body positions shift, and the tail (1,4) is removed since no food eaten, so new snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] and (1,4) is gone, so tail is now (1,3).\n\nPositions: 18 segments originally? Count: indices 0 to 17, 18 positions? 0:(6,2),1:(6,3),2:(6,4),3:(6,5),4:(6,6),5:(5,6),6:(4,6),7:(4,5),8:(4,4),9:(4,3),10:(5,3),11:(5,2),12:(4,2),13:(3,2),14:(2,2),15:(1,2),16:(1,3),17:(1,4) — that's 18 positions, so length 18.\n\nAfter moving to (6,1) without eating, head to (6,1), then positions 0 to 16 become body, and tail removed, so new positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] — 18 positions? Head (6,1), then (6,2) to (1,3), that's 18 cells, but since no food, length should be same, but we removed one from tail.\n\nOriginal: 18 positions.\n\nAfter move: new head at (6,1), then the first body is the old head (6,2), then old (6,3) to (1,3), and the old tail (1,4) is removed, so the new body has positions from old [0] to [16], but old [0] is now body, old [1] to [16] are shifted, and old [17] is removed.\n\nBetter to think: the snake moves, so the segment at old [17] (tail) is removed, and new head is added at (6,1), so the new positions are: new head (6,1), then old head (6,2), then old body (6,3) to (1,3), and (1,4) removed, so (1,3) is now the last body segment, tail.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (6,2) head, 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), ..., 16: (1,3), 17: (1,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (6,1): new head (6,1), then the old positions from 0 to 16 become the body, so new body: (6,2), (6,3), ..., (1,3), and the old tail (1,4) is removed, so new tail is (1,3). So new positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] — that's 18 positions, but since we added a new head and removed tail, it should be same length, 18 cells. Yes.\n\nNow, at turn 63, head at (6,1), direction is D, since we moved down.\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,1):\n\n- Down: to (6,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: to (5,1)\n\n- Right: to (7,1) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Up: to (6,2), but (6,2) is now occupied by body? (6,2) is the first body segment.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), etc.\n\nMoving up to (6,2) would be into the body cell, collision.\n\nAnd direction is D, so moving up is reverse, forbidden.\n\nSo possible moves: only left to (5,1)? Down and right invalid, up forbidden and collision.\n\nLeft to (5,1): is (5,1) free?\n\n(5,1): x=5, y=1. Not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (3,1)), not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,2) is there, but (5,1) not in list, so should be free.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nThen for turn 63, action L.\n\nThen head to (5,1), and so on.\n\nBut this seems like we're getting trapped.\n\nLet's think longer term.\n\nWe need to get to the food.\n\nFood at (2,4) and (1,5) are available for a few turns.\n\n(6,3) food is under body, but at (6,3), which is still occupied.\n\nAfter turn 62 move to (6,1), at turn 63 we move to (5,1), then head at (5,1).\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (1,3).\n\n(6,3) is still occupied.\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves: direction is L, since we moved left.\n\nHead direction: after moving left to (5,1), direction is L.\n\nPossible moves: not reverse, so cannot move right.\n\nDown: to (5,0) wall, invalid.\n\nUp: to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is occupied by body? In new positions, (5,2) is a body segment.\n\nList: after turn 63, positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2)? (5,2) is in the list.\n\nAfter turn 62: positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nSo (5,2) is index 12, body segment.\n\nMoving up to (5,2) from (5,1) would be into body cell, collision.\n\nLeft: to (4,1)\n\n(4,1): x=4,y=1, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (3,1)), not occupied? Not in positions, so free.\n\nRight: to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by body, and moving right is reverse? Direction is L, so moving right is opposite, forbidden.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 64, head to (4,1), direction L.\n\nContinue this way, we're moving left along the bottom.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves:\n\nDirection L.\n\nCannot move right (reverse).\n\nDown: to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nUp: to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is occupied by body? Positions: after previous, head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), etc., and (4,2) is in the list, index 13 or something.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2) and (1,3)? Tail is (1,3).\n\n(4,2) is occupied.\n\nMoving up to (4,2) collision.\n\nLeft: to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nRight: to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied by body, and moving right is reverse, forbidden.\n\nSo from (4,1), no possible moves? That's a problem.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt turn 62: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 63: from (6,1), move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 64: from (5,1), move L to (4,1) — only choice.\n\nNow at (4,1), direction L.\n\nNow, moves:\n\n- Down: (4,0) wall, invalid\n\n- Up: (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, collision\n\n- Left: (3,1) obstacle, invalid\n\n- Right: (5,1) but (5,1) is body, occupied, and moving right is reverse, forbidden\n\nSo indeed, no valid move! Snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be right; I must have a mistake.\n\nAt turn 64, from (4,1), the body positions: head is at (4,1), previous head was (5,1) at turn 63.\n\nAt turn 63, after move to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), and tail (1,3)? Let's list properly.\n\nAfter turn 63 move to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Old positions: from turn 62, head was (6,1), body (6,2) to (1,3)\n\nSo new body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)\n\n(1,3) is tail.\n\nThen at turn 64, from (5,1), we move to (4,1), so new head (4,1), new body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), and tail (1,3) removed, so new tail is (1,2).\n\nNew positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)] — 19 positions? No: added new head, removed tail, so length same, 18 positions.\n\nPositions: 0:(4,1) head, 1:(5,1), 2:(6,1), 3:(6,2), 4:(6,3), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,5), 7:(6,6), 8:(5,6), 9:(4,6), 10:(4,5), 11:(4,4), 12:(4,3), 13:(5,3), 14:(5,2), 15:(4,2), 16:(3,2), 17:(2,2), 18:(1,2)? That's 19, but should be 18.\n\nI think I double-counted.\n\nAt turn 63, positions: 18 cells: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), and (1,3) is tail, but after move, when we go to turn 64, move to (4,1), new head (4,1), then the old positions from turn 63: the head (5,1) becomes body, and the body from (6,1) to (1,2), and tail (1,3) removed.\n\nTurn 63 positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), and (1,3) is last, tail.\n\nWhen moving to (4,1), new head (4,1), then the old head (5,1) becomes first body, then old body (6,1) to (1,2) become the next bodies, and the old tail (1,3) is removed. So new positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2) is new tail. (1,2) is now the last.\n\n(1,2) is position, and (1,3) removed.\n\nSo 18 positions.\n\nAt (4,1), head, direction L.\n\nNow moves:\n\n- Down: (4,0) y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Up: (4,2) but (4,2) is in positions, index 15 or something, (4,2) is occupied by body, so collision\n\n- Left: (3,1) obstacle, invalid\n\n- Right: (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied by body (first body segment), and moving right is opposite to current direction L, so forbidden and collision.\n\nSo indeed, no valid move, snake dies at turn 64.\n\nBut that means at turn 62, moving down is suicidal. But at turn 62, it was the only possible move? Earlier I thought so.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 62.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down to (6,1): as above, leads to death\n\n- Left to (5,2): but (5,2) is occupied by body, collision\n\n- Right to (7,2): wall, invalid\n\n- Up to (6,3): but (6,3) is occupied by body, and moving up is reverse, forbidden\n\nSo apparently no good move, but that can't be; perhaps I missed something.\n\n(5,2) is occupied, but is it the tail? No, tail is (1,4).\n\nBut the rule says: \"you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut here, (5,2) is not the tail; it's a body segment far from tail.\n\nSo moving to (5,2) should cause collision.\n\nPerhaps at turn 62, when we move, the tail is moving, but the cell is occupied at the time of move.\n\nThe collision rule: \"body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for a move to be valid, the cell must be free or the tail cell, because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, for moving to (5,2), it is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so it should be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is occupied and reverse.\n\nSo only (6,1) is free, but it leads to trap.\n\nBut at (6,2), is there a way to not move down?\n\nPerhaps the food at (6,3) can be eaten if we can move to it, but it's occupied and we can't move up.\n\nAnother idea: maybe at turn 62, we can move in a way that the body moves away from (6,3) later.\n\nBut at turn 62, only move possible is down to (6,1).\n\nBut that leads to death, so the snake is in a bad position.\n\nPerhaps I misidentified the direction or something.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction D, down.\n\nPrevious position must have been (6,3), since moving down from (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nNow, the food at (6,3) is under the body, but since the snake is moving, at the next move, if we move away, (6,3) might be vacated later.\n\nBut at turn 62, we have to move.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (6,3) can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it, but at this point, we can't move to it directly.\n\nBut for survival, we need to find a path.\n\nPerhaps from (6,2), moving left to (5,2) is possible if (5,2) is the tail, but it's not; tail is (1,4).\n\nUnless after the move, the tail moves, but at the time of move, (5,2) is occupied, so collision occurs when head moves to occupied cell.\n\nThe rule is: \"body collision if head touches any body segment\" except when it is the tail cell and the tail moves.\n\nBut (5,2) is not the tail cell, so it should be collision.\n\nLet's read the rule carefully: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for non-tail body segments, moving into them causes collision.\n\nIn this case, (5,2) is not tail, so moving to (5,2) causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is not tail.\n\nSo only (6,1) is free.\n\nBut moving there leads to death in two turns.\n\nSo the snake is doomed? But that can't be the intention; perhaps I have a mistake in the grid or positions.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells at turn 62:\n\nSnake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nSo cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (4,3), (5,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4) has food, (2,5), (2,6), (3,1) obstacle, (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (5,1), (5,4), (5,5), (6,1), etc.\n\nAt (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- D to (6,1): free\n\n- L to (5,2): occupied\n\n- R to (7,2): wall\n\n- U to (6,3): occupied and reverse\n\nSo only D to (6,1).\n\nThen at (6,1), moves:\n\n- D to (6,0): wall\n\n- L to (5,1): free\n\n- R to (7,1): wall\n\n- U to (6,2): occupied and reverse forbidden\n\nSo L to (5,1)\n\nAt (5,1), moves:\n\n- D to (5,0): wall\n\n- U to (5,2): occupied\n\n- L to (4,1): free\n\n- R to (6,1): occupied and reverse forbidden\n\nSo L to (4,1)\n\nAt (4,1), moves:\n\n- D to (4,0): wall\n\n- U to (4,2): occupied\n\n- L to (3,1): obstacle\n\n- R to (5,1): occupied and reverse forbidden\n\nNo move, death.\n\nSo from turn 62, the only sequence leads to death at turn 64.\n\nBut at turn 64, when at (4,1), if we could move up, but (4,2) is body, and it's not the tail, so collision.\n\nUnless the tail is moving, but at the time, (4,2) is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so head moving to it causes collision.\n\nSo the snake cannot move and dies.\n\nBut that means for turn 62, we have to move D, and then the game ends soon.\n\nBut perhaps we can eat food to grow and change the tail position.\n\nFor example, if we can eat the food at (2,4) or something, but we're far away.\n\nAt turn 62, head at (6,2), food at (2,4) is 2 units away in x and 2 in y, but we can't reach it directly.\n\nWith the moves, we're stuck in the bottom left.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to move to (5,2) if we consider the tail, but (5,2) is not tail.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 62, when we move, the snake will move, so the cell (5,2) might be vacated if the tail moves, but at the time of move, when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by non-tail body, it collides before the tail moves.\n\nThe sequence is: for each turn, the head moves to a new cell. If the new cell is food, it eats and grows, so tail doesn't move. If not, tail moves off.\n\nBut for collision, if the new head cell is occupied by a body segment (except the tail), then collision occurs.\n\nIf it is the tail cell, then it is allowed, because the tail will move, so it's like moving to the tail position just as it leaves.\n\nBut for other body segments, they are not moving at that instant, so collision.\n\nIn this case, (5,2) is not the tail, so moving to it causes collision.\n\nSo for turn 62, we must move D to (6,1), and then the snake will die in a few turns.\n\nBut let's check the food life span. (2,4) life span 4, available until turn 65, but we can't reach it.\n\n(1,5) life span 6, available longer.\n\n(6,3) life span 9, but under body.\n\nPerhaps after moving down to (6,1), at turn 63, if we could move somewhere else, but only left to (5,1).\n\nThen at turn 63, from (6,1), we move to (5,1), but before that, at turn 63, head at (6,1), we move to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is free, so no problem.\n\nThen at (5,1), as above.\n\nBut at turn 63, after moving to (5,1), the position (6,3) is still occupied, but the food is there, life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 64, we move to (4,1), then at turn 65, from (4,1), no move, death.\n\nSo we only have until turn 64.\n\nBut for the answer, we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the snake dies at turn 64, for turn 62, we can only output one action.\n\nBut the answer format requires multiple turns: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\"\n\nBut in this case, after turn 62, we can only do one more action at turn 63, then at turn 64, no action, death.\n\nBut let's assume we must output for as long as possible.\n\nPerhaps I missed a move at turn 62.\n\nAnother possibility: the head direction is D, but when we move, the direction changes.\n\nBut at turn 62, from (6,2), moving down to (6,1), direction becomes D.\n\nThen from (6,1), moving left to (5,1), direction becomes L.\n\nThen from (5,1), moving left to (4,1), direction L.\n\nThen stuck.\n\nPerhaps at turn 62, we can move left if (5,2) is considered, but it's not tail.\n\nUnless the tail is adjacent or something, but no.\n\nLet's list the tail position: at turn 62, tail is (1,4).\n\nAfter move, it changes.\n\nBut at turn 62, (5,2) is not tail.\n\nSo I think the only choice is to move down and accept death.\n\nBut that seems odd for the problem.\n\nPerhaps the food at (6,3) can be eaten if we move the head to it when it's free, but it's not free now.\n\nOr perhaps at turn 62, if we move in a way that the body moves away quickly.\n\nBut we can't.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we can move up, even though it's reverse, but the rule says \"no instant reverse\", so we cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so cannot move U.\n\nSo it's forbidden.\n\nSo I think for turn 62, we have to move D to (6,1).\n\nThen for turn 63, move L to (5,1).\n\nThen for turn 64, move L to (4,1), and then at turn 65, no move, so we stop or something.\n\nBut for the answer, we can output the actions until we can't move.\n\nBut the problem says to think 5+ turns ahead, but here we can only do 2 more turns.\n\nPerhaps at turn 62, there is a way to move to a different cell.\n\nLet's double-check the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]\n\nSo (5,2) is in the list, position 11.\n\nHead is at (6,2), moving to (5,2) is left, to a cell occupied by body.\n\nUnless at the time of move, the snake moves, so the body at (5,2) will be the new position, but when the head moves to (5,2), the cell is occupied by the current body, so collision.\n\nI think it's not possible.\n\nPerhaps the grid has more space.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), we can move down or left, but left is occupied.\n\nSo I think we have to move down.\n\nThen for the answer, we can plan for the available moves.\n\nSo for turn 62: D\n\nThen turn 63: from (6,1), only L to (5,1), so L\n\nThen turn 64: from (5,1), only L to (4,1), so L\n\nThen at (4,1), no move, so we don't output more.\n\nBut the food at (6,3) might be available later, but we can't reach it.\n\nOr (2,4) is at (2,4), which is free, but we are at bottom left.\n\nFrom (4,1), if we could move up, but (4,2) is body.\n\nAt turn 64, after moving to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), etc., and (4,2) is body.\n\nIf at that point, (4,2) were the tail, but it's not; tail is (1,2) or something.\n\nAfter turn 64 move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2) tail.\n\n(4,2) is index 15 or something, not tail.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the only actions are for turn 62: D, turn 63: L, turn 64: L.\n\nThen at turn 65, no move, death.\n\nFor the answer, we can output these.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span of food.\n\nAt turn 62, food at (2,4) life 4, so available turn 62,63,64,65.\n\nBut we can't eat it.\n\n(1,5) life 6, available longer.\n\n(6,3) life 9, available.\n\nBut we can't eat them.\n\nSo for the output:\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nTurn 64: L\n\nAnd that's all.\n\nBut the answer format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but here we can't, so we do what we can.\n\nPerhaps at turn 62, we can move in a way to eat the food at (6,3) later.\n\nBut with the current path, we can't.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 62, if we move down to (6,1), then at turn 63, from (6,1), we have to move left to (5,1), but then at turn 64, from (5,1), instead of moving left, can we move up? But up to (5,2) is occupied, and direction is L, so moving up is not reverse, but (5,2) is occupied, so collision.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle at (3,1) is not a wall, but it's given as internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll output the actions until death.\n\nSo for turn 62: D\n\nThen for turn 63: from (6,1), only L, so L\n\nFor turn 64: from (5,1), only L to (4,1), so L\n\nThen stop.\n\nBut at turn 64, after moving to (4,1), the position is stuck, so no turn 65 action.\n\nSo in the box, we can put:\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nTurn 64: L\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut let's make sure about the direction.\n\nAt turn 62, head at (6,2), direction D, move D to (6,1), new direction D.\n\nTurn 63, head at (6,1), direction D, move L to (5,1), new direction L.\n\nTurn 64, head at (5,1), direction L, move L to (4,1), new direction L.\n\nThen at (4,1), no move.\n\nSo actions for turn 62,63,64.\n\nThe current turn is t1=62, so we output for turn 62,63,64.\n\nFor the food, (6,3) is at (6,3), with life span 9, but it's under body until we move away, but we don't.\n\nIn this path, (6,3) remains occupied.\n\nSo no eating.\n\nI think that's the only way.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: L\nTurn 64: L\n}\n\nBut to match the format, we can write the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can think that at turn 62, moving left to (5,2) is allowed if we consider the tail movement, but I think not, based on the rules.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment\"\n\nBut here, (5,2) is not the tail segment; the tail is at (1,4).\n\nSo it should be collision.\n\nTherefore, I think the above is correct.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Planning\n\n**Current Turn:** \\( t_1 = 62 \\)  \n**Snake Position:** Head at (6,2), with body segments extending to tail at (1,4). The snake has 18 segments.  \n**Head Direction:** Down (D), meaning the snake moved downward to reach (6,2).  \n**Grid Constraints:**  \n- Walls: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,1). Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,1).  \n**Food:**  \n- (2,4): Value +1, life span 4 (available until turn 65 inclusive).  \n- (1,5): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 67 inclusive).  \n- (6,3): Value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 70 inclusive), but currently under the snake body at position (6,3). It can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.  \n\n**Immediate Constraints at Turn 62:**  \n- Head at (6,2), direction D. Possible moves:  \n  - Down (D) to (6,1): Valid, as (6,1) is free (not wall, obstacle, or occupied by non-tail body).  \n  - Left (L) to (5,2): Invalid, as (5,2) is occupied by a non-tail body segment (index 11 in positions), causing collision.  \n  - Right (R) to (7,2): Invalid, x=7 is a wall.  \n  - Up (U) to (6,3): Invalid, as it is the reverse direction (forbidden) and (6,3) is occupied.  \n- **Only valid move is Down (D) to (6,1).**  \n\n**Consequences of Moving Down at Turn 62:**  \n- New head position: (6,1).  \n- Snake length remains 18 (no food eaten).  \n- Direction updates to D.  \n- Food life spans decrease: (2,4) life span now 3, (1,5) life span now 5, (6,3) life span now 8.  \n- (6,3) food remains under the body and cannot be eaten yet.  \n\n**Turn 63 State:**  \n- Head at (6,1), direction D.  \n- Possible moves:  \n  - Down (D) to (6,0): Invalid, y=0 wall.  \n  - Left (L) to (5,1): Valid, as (5,1) is free.  \n  - Right (R) to (7,1): Invalid, x=7 wall.  \n  - Up (U) to (6,2): Invalid, reverse direction and (6,2) is occupied by body.  \n- **Only valid move is Left (L) to (5,1).**  \n\n**Consequences of Moving Left at Turn 63:**  \n- New head position: (5,1).  \n- Snake length remains 18.  \n- Direction updates to L.  \n- Food life spans decrease: (2,4) life span now 2, (1,5) life span now 4, (6,3) life span now 7.  \n- (6,3) food still under body.  \n\n**Turn 64 State:**  \n- Head at (5,1), direction L.  \n- Possible moves:  \n  - Down (D) to (5,0): Invalid, y=0 wall.  \n  - Up (U) to (5,2): Invalid, as (5,2) is occupied by body (not tail).  \n  - Left (L) to (4,1): Valid, as (4,1) is free.  \n  - Right (R) to (6,1): Invalid, reverse direction and (6,1) is occupied.  \n- **Only valid move is Left (L) to (4,1).**  \n\n**Consequences of Moving Left at Turn 64:**  \n- New head position: (4,1).  \n- Snake length remains 18.  \n- Direction updates to L.  \n- Food life spans decrease: (2,4) life span now 1, (1,5) life span now 3, (6,3) life span now 6.  \n- (6,3) food still under body.  \n\n**Turn 65 State:**  \n- Head at (4,1), direction L.  \n- Possible moves:  \n  - Down (D) to (4,0): Invalid, y=0 wall.  \n  - Up (U) to (4,2): Invalid, as (4,2) is occupied by body (not tail).  \n  - Left (L) to (3,1): Invalid, (3,1) is an obstacle.  \n  - Right (R) to (5,1): Invalid, reverse direction and (5,1) is occupied.  \n- **No valid moves—snake dies due to no escape.**  \n\n### Long-Term Planning and Risk Assessment\n- **Survival Priority:** The snake is trapped in the bottom-left corner after turn 64, with no safe moves by turn 65. This path is unavoidable given the initial constraints.  \n- **Food Accessibility:**  \n  - (2,4): Cannot be reached before it disappears (life span 1 on turn 65, but snake is at (4,1) and stuck).  \n  - (1,5): Cannot be reached (snake is trapped).  \n  - (6,3): Cannot be eaten as the body never vacates (6,3) in this path.  \n- **5+ Turn Outlook:** With death imminent by turn 65, planning beyond turn 64 is impossible. The priority is to survive as long as possible, which means taking the only available moves at each turn.  \n\n### Action Plan\nThe actions are determined solely by immediate survival, as no alternatives exist. Output the moves for turns 62, 63, and 64, as the snake cannot move on turn 65.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: D \\\\\nTurn 63: L \\\\\nTurn 64: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 63, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be 8x8, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. Walls are at the borders and one internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSnake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3). That's 18 segments. Let me count: positions from (6,1) to (1,3) – that's 18 positions. So snake length is 18.\n\nHead direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, I assume. Since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, U is (x,y+1), so up increases y, down decreases y. So (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction down, so moving to (6,0)? But (6,0) is a wall, since y=0 is border. But in the movement, it would collide with wall if it moves down to (6,0). But let's see the current head position.\n\nHead is at (6,1), and direction is D, so if it moves down, it would go to (6,0), which is a wall, so that would be a collision. But the snake must be alive now, so it didn't just move into a wall; maybe it can't move down because of wall? But the direction is given as D, meaning it was moving down to (6,1) from previous position.\n\nLet's see the positions: snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), ...] so head at (6,1), and previous head was at (6,2) I think? Positions are listed head first: (6,1) is head, then (6,2) is the first body segment, which would be the neck, meaning it came from above, from (6,2) to (6,1), so moving down. Yes, direction D.\n\nNow, from (6,1), if it moves down, to (6,0), which is y=0, wall, so death. But it can choose to move in other directions, I think. The action is for the next move.\n\nCurrent state is given, and I need to decide actions starting from turn 63.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,4) with value 1, life span 3? The format is (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see: \" (2, 4, 3, 1) \" so I think (x,y, life_span, value) so (2,4) has life span 3, value 1.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5,5,1) so (1,5) life span 5, value 1.\n\nAnd (6,3,8,1) so (6,3) life span 8, value 1.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food? Value 1, but it says value1, etc., and for negative food it would be -1, but here all are 1, so all positive food.\n\nBut there's a note about negative food, but in this state, all food is positive.\n\nLife span: for (2,4) life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? So at turn 63, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 65? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nSuppose at turn t, life span is L. Then on turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, it decreases to L-1? I think it's better to think: at the start of turn, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, so after turn t+L-1 or something.\n\nStandard way: if life span is given as N at turn t, it means it will disappear after N turns, so it exists for turns t to t+N-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+N or something.\n\nBut let's see the countdown: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (2,4), life span 3 at turn 63. So on turn 63, countdown=3. After turn 63, it decreases to 2. After turn 64, to 1. After turn 65, to 0, and then it disappears? Or when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after\" means after N turns have passed, so at turn t+N it is gone.\n\nBut countdown decreases including current turn.\n\nExample: at turn t, life span N, countdown starts at N. After current turn (turn t), countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown=0, and after that, it disappears, so not present on turn t+N.\n\nSimilarly, here turn 63, food at (2,4) has life span 3, so:\n\n- Turn 63: countdown=3, present\n\n- Turn 64: countdown=2, present\n\n- Turn 65: countdown=1, present\n\n- Turn 66: countdown=0, disappears, not present.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 5: present until turn 67 (since 63+5-1=67, countdown=0 after turn 67, gone on 68).\n\nTurn 63: life span 5, countdown=5\n\nAfter turn 63: countdown=4\n\nAfter turn 64: countdown=3\n\nAfter turn 65: countdown=2\n\nAfter turn 66: countdown=1\n\nAfter turn 67: countdown=0, disappears, so not present on turn 68.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) life span 8: present until turn 70.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,1), direction down. But (6,1) moving down to (6,0) is wall, so it must not move down, or it will die.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,1), can move up, left, or right? But direction is down, but for next move, it can choose U, L, R, but not D because wall or because instant reverse? Instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So cannot move U immediately, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nRules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is D, so cannot move U.\n\nAlso, moving D to (6,0) is wall, collision.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,1): L to (5,1) or R to (7,1).\n\nx=7 is wall, since border x=7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nSo (7,1) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,0) wall.\n\n(5,1): is that free? Let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (3,1).\n\nNow, snake positions: list of all segments.\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nBody: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nTail is (1,3)\n\nNow, from head (6,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (6,2) – but (6,2) is occupied by snake body, the second segment. So moving there would collide with body.\n\n- D: to (6,0) – wall, collision.\n\n- L: to (5,1) – what is (5,1)? Is it free?\n\nLook at snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), etc., no (5,1) in the list. Also, not a wall. Walls are only borders and (3,1), so (5,1) should be free.\n\n- R: to (7,1) – x=7 is wall, so collision.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nIs that right? U to (6,2) is body, D to wall, R to wall, so only L to (5,1) is possible? But I thought cannot instant reverse, but moving left is not opposite to down? Directions: down is decreasing y, left is decreasing x, so not opposite. Opposite of down is up.\n\nSo moving L from current direction D is allowed, since not opposite.\n\nSimilarly, R would be allowed but wall.\n\nSo yes, only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nBut let's confirm: current head (6,1), direction D (meaning it came from (6,2) to (6,1), so moving down.\n\nNow, for next move, options:\n\n- U: up to (6,2) – but (6,2) is occupied, so collision. Also, instant reverse? Moving up is opposite to down, so cannot do that anyway because of no instant reverse rule.\n\nRule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" so since current direction is D, cannot move U.\n\n- D: to (6,0) – wall, collision.\n\n- L: to (5,1) – should be free.\n\n- R: to (7,1) – wall, collision.\n\nSo indeed, only L to (5,1) is possible without dying.\n\nBut is (5,1) free? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nSo (5,1) not in list, and not wall, so yes, free.\n\nAlso, food at (2,4), (1,5), (6,3) – but (6,3) is occupied by snake body? (6,3) is the third segment, so occupied, but food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n\nBut for now, (5,1) is free, so moving to (5,1) is safe.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, on turn 63, I must move to (5,1), since it's the only choice to survive.\n\nThen, after that, the snake will have moved.\n\nWhen snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, length stays same, tail moves forward.\n\nIf it eats food, length increases by one, so tail doesn't move.\n\nHere, (5,1) has no food, so after moving to (5,1), the head is at (5,1), and the tail will move from (1,3) to the next position? Tail is at (1,3), and since no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed, so new positions: head at (5,1), then the previous head (6,1) becomes body, so body from (6,1) to ... but the segment that was at (6,2) is now at (6,1)? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: before move: head (6,1), then body: (6,2), (6,3), ..., up to tail (1,3)\n\nAfter moving left to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Body: the first body segment (previously at (6,2)) moves to (6,1) (previous head position)\n\n- Then (6,3) moves to (6,2)\n\n- (6,4) to (6,3)\n\n- (6,5) to (6,4)\n\n- (6,6) to (6,5)\n\n- (5,6) to (6,6)\n\n- (4,6) to (5,6)\n\n- (4,5) to (4,6)? No.\n\nThe positions in order:\n\nIndex: 0: head (6,1)\n\n1: (6,2)\n\n2: (6,3)\n\n3: (6,4)\n\n4: (6,5)\n\n5: (6,6)\n\n6: (5,6)\n\n7: (4,6)\n\n8: (4,5)\n\n9: (4,4)\n\n10: (4,3)\n\n11: (5,3)\n\n12: (5,2)\n\n13: (4,2)\n\n14: (3,2)\n\n15: (2,2)\n\n16: (1,2)\n\n17: tail (1,3)\n\nAfter move to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Then new body: position 0 becomes body at (6,1) — since head moved from (6,1) to (5,1), so (6,1) is now the neck.\n\nThen position 1 moves to where position 0 was, so to (6,1)? No.\n\nThe body segments follow: the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head at (5,1)\n\n- Segment that was at index 1 ( (6,2) ) moves to where index 0 was, so to (6,1)\n\n- Segment that was at index 2 ( (6,3) ) moves to where index 1 was, so to (6,2)\n\n- Similarly, index 3 ( (6,4) ) to (6,3)\n\n- Index 4 ( (6,5) ) to (6,4)\n\n- Index 5 ( (6,6) ) to (6,5)\n\n- Index 6 ( (5,6) ) to (6,6) — (5,6) was at index 6, moves to where index 5 was, which is (6,6)\n\n- Index 7 ( (4,6) ) moves to where index 6 was, which is (5,6)\n\n- Index 8 ( (4,5) ) moves to where index 7 was, which is (4,6)\n\n- Index 9 ( (4,4) ) moves to where index 8 was, which is (4,5)\n\n- Index 10 ( (4,3) ) moves to where index 9 was, which is (4,4)\n\n- Index 11 ( (5,3) ) moves to where index 10 was, which is (4,3)\n\n- Index 12 ( (5,2) ) moves to where index 11 was, which is (5,3)\n\n- Index 13 ( (4,2) ) moves to where index 12 was, which is (5,2)\n\n- Index 14 ( (3,2) ) moves to where index 13 was, which is (4,2)\n\n- Index 15 ( (2,2) ) moves to where index 14 was, which is (3,2)\n\n- Index 16 ( (1,2) ) moves to where index 15 was, which is (2,2)\n\n- Index 17 ( (1,3) ) was tail, and since no food eaten, it is removed, so no longer part of snake.\n\nThe new tail is the segment that was at index 16, which is now at (2,2), but after moving, index 16 moved to (2,2), which was position of index 15.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,1)\n\nThen body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nList:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Body: (6,1)  // previous head position\n\n- Then (6,2) // from index 2 moved to (6,2)? Earlier: segment index 1 moved to (6,1), index 2 to (6,2), index 3 to (6,3), index 4 to (6,4), index 5 to (6,5), index 6 to (6,6), index 7 to (5,6), index 8 to (4,6), index 9 to (4,5)? Index 8 was (4,5), moved to where index 7 was (4,6)? Messy.\n\nFrom the movement:\n\n- New position 0: head at (5,1)\n\n- New position 1: the segment that was at old index 1 moves to old position of index 0, which is (6,1)\n\n- New position 2: old index 2 moves to old position of index 1, which is (6,2)\n\n- New position 3: old index 3 moves to old position of index 2, which is (6,3)\n\n- New position 4: old index 4 moves to old position of index 3, which is (6,4)\n\n- New position 5: old index 5 moves to old position of index 4, which is (6,5)\n\n- New position 6: old index 6 moves to old position of index 5, which is (6,6)\n\n- New position 7: old index 7 moves to old position of index 6, which is (5,6)\n\n- New position 8: old index 8 moves to old position of index 7, which is (4,6)\n\n- New position 9: old index 9 moves to old position of index 8, which is (4,5)  // old index 8 was at (4,5), but it moves to old position of index 7, which is (4,6)\n\nOld positions:\n\nIndex 7: (4,6)\n\nIndex 8: (4,5)\n\nSo when index 8 moves to position of index 7, it goes to (4,6)\n\nSimilarly, index 9 (4,4) moves to position of index 8, which was (4,5)\n\nIndex 10 (4,3) moves to position of index 9, which was (4,4)\n\nIndex 11 (5,3) moves to position of index 10, which was (4,3)\n\nIndex 12 (5,2) moves to position of index 11, which was (5,3)\n\nIndex 13 (4,2) moves to position of index 12, which was (5,2)\n\nIndex 14 (3,2) moves to position of index 13, which was (4,2)\n\nIndex 15 (2,2) moves to position of index 14, which was (3,2)\n\nIndex 16 (1,2) moves to position of index 15, which was (2,2)\n\nIndex 17 (1,3) is removed.\n\nSo new snake positions after move to (5,1):\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nThen: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nThe last position is (2,2), which came from index 16 moving to (2,2).\n\nNew length is 17, since tail removed.\n\nOld length 18, no food, so new length 17.\n\nPositions: from head to tail: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\n16 segments? Head + 15 body? Count: 1 head + 16 body positions? List:\n\n- 0: (5,1) head\n\n- 1: (6,1)\n\n- 2: (6,2)\n\n- 3: (6,3)\n\n- 4: (6,4)\n\n- 5: (6,5)\n\n- 6: (6,6)\n\n- 7: (5,6)\n\n- 8: (4,6)\n\n- 9: (4,5)\n\n- 10: (4,4)\n\n- 11: (4,3)\n\n- 12: (5,3)  // since old (5,3) moved to (4,3)? In new, position 12 is (5,3)? From above: new position 12: old index 12 moved to position of index 11, which was (5,3)? Old index 11 was (5,3), position of index 11 is (5,3), but new position for index 12 is where old index 11 was, which is (5,3).\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nNew positions:\n\n- New 0: (5,1)\n\n- New 1: old index 1 at (6,1)  // moved to old pos 0\n\n- New 2: old index 2 at (6,2)  // moved to old pos 1\n\n- New 3: old index 3 at (6,3)  // to old pos 2\n\n- New 4: old index 4 at (6,4)  // to old pos 3\n\n- New 5: old index 5 at (6,5)  // to old pos 4\n\n- New 6: old index 6 at (6,6)  // to old pos 5\n\n- New 7: old index 7 at (5,6)  // to old pos 6? Old pos 6 was (5,6), but new position 7 is old index 7 moving to old position of index 6.\n\nOld position of index 6 is (5,6), so new position 7 is (5,6)\n\nSimilarly, new position 8: old index 8 moving to old position of index 7, which is (4,6)\n\nNew position 9: old index 9 moving to old position of index 8, which is (4,5)\n\nNew position 10: old index 10 moving to old position of index 9, which is (4,4)\n\nNew position 11: old index 11 moving to old position of index 10, which is (4,3)\n\nNew position 12: old index 12 moving to old position of index 11, which is (5,3)  // old index 11 was at (5,3)\n\nNew position 13: old index 13 moving to old position of index 12, which is (5,2)\n\nNew position 14: old index 14 moving to old position of index 13, which is (4,2)\n\nNew position 15: old index 15 moving to old position of index 14, which is (3,2)\n\nNew position 16: old index 16 moving to old position of index 15, which is (2,2)\n\nAnd old index 17 removed.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nThat's 17 positions.\n\nNow, head direction: after moving left, new direction is L (left).\n\nNow, for turn 64, I need to decide action.\n\nHead at (5,1), direction L (since it moved left from (6,1) to (5,1)).\n\nPossible moves: from (5,1)\n\n- U: to (5,2) – what is (5,2)? In new positions, (5,2) is occupied, it's position 13 in the list? Positions: (5,1) head, then (6,1), (6,2), ..., up to (5,2) is at index 13? List: index 0: (5,1), 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (4,6), 9: (4,5), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,3), 12: (5,3), 13: (5,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (3,2), 16: (2,2)\n\nSo (5,2) is at index 13, which is a body segment, so occupied. Moving to (5,2) would collide with body.\n\n- D: to (5,0) – but y=0 is wall, so collision.\n\n- L: to (4,1) – is (4,1) free? Not in snake positions, and not wall. Walls are x=0,7 y=0,7 and (3,1), so (4,1) should be free.\n\n- R: to (6,1) – but (6,1) is occupied, it's the first body segment, index 1.\n\nAlso, current direction is L (left), so moving R (right) would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,2) occupied, collision\n\n- D: to (5,0) wall, collision\n\n- L: to (4,1) free\n\n- R: to (6,1) occupied and instant reverse not allowed\n\nSo only L to (4,1) is possible.\n\nAgain, only one choice to survive.\n\nMove to (4,1).\n\nThen similarly, after that, new head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nNow, (4,1) is next to the internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,1) is wall, so cannot move left to (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), after moving left to it.\n\nFor turn 65, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) – what is (4,2)? In current snake, (4,2) is occupied, index 14 in previous state? After the move to (4,1), let's simulate.\n\nFirst, on turn 64, moved to (4,1) from (5,1).\n\nBefore move, positions: head at (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nMove to (4,1):\n\n- New head: (4,1)\n\n- Body: segment that was at index 1 moves to (5,1) (previous head)\n\nThen segment index 2 to (6,1) (previous pos of index 1)\n\nIndex 3 to (6,2)\n\n...\nSince no food eaten, tail removed.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- New 1: old index 1 to (5,1)\n\n- New 2: old index 2 to (6,1)\n\n- New 3: old index 3 to (6,2)\n\n- New 4: old index 4 to (6,3)\n\n- New 5: old index 5 to (6,4)\n\n- New 6: old index 6 to (6,5)\n\n- New 7: old index 7 to (6,6)\n\n- New 8: old index 8 to (5,6)  // old index 7 was at (5,6)? Old positions: index 7: (5,6), so new position for old index 8: moves to position of old index 7, which is (5,6)\n\nOld index 7: (5,6)\n\nOld index 8: (4,6)\n\nNew position 8: old index 8 moves to old pos of index 7, (5,6)\n\nNew position 9: old index 9 moves to old pos of index 8, (4,6)\n\nNew position 10: old index 10 moves to old pos of index 9, (4,5)\n\nNew position 11: old index 11 moves to old pos of index 10, (4,4)\n\nNew position 12: old index 12 moves to old pos of index 11, (4,3)\n\nNew position 13: old index 13 moves to old pos of index 12, (5,3)\n\nNew position 14: old index 14 moves to old pos of index 13, (5,2)\n\nNew position 15: old index 15 moves to old pos of index 14, (4,2)\n\nNew position 16: old index 16 moves to old pos of index 15, (3,2)\n\nOld index 17 was removed earlier, so new length 16.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nIndex 16 is (3,2)\n\nTail at (3,2)\n\nNow, for turn 65, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) – (4,2) is occupied, it's in the body, new position 15: (4,2)? List: positions after move: 0: (4,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (4,4), 12: (4,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (5,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (3,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is at index 15, body segment, so occupied.\n\n- D: to (4,0) – y=0 wall, collision.\n\n- L: to (3,1) – but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so collision.\n\n- R: to (5,1) – (5,1) is occupied, it's the first body segment, index 1. Also, moving right is instant reverse, since current direction left.\n\nSo all moves seem deadly? U occupied, D wall, L wall, R occupied and instant reverse.\n\nBut there must be a way.\n\n(4,1) to U (4,2) occupied, D (4,0) wall, L (3,1) wall, R (5,1) occupied.\n\nNo free cell? But the snake must be able to move.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nFood at (6,3) is on the body, but it's not relevant for movement.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is moving, so when the snake moves, the tail moves away, so cells might be freed.\n\nIn this case, from (4,1), after moving, the tail was at (3,2), but in the new positions, it's still occupied.\n\nBut for moving to (4,2), it is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so it won't move away immediately.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is occupied.\n\nSo no possible move? But that can't be; probably I made a mistake in the positions.\n\nLet's go back to turn 63.\n\nAt turn 63, head at (6,1), move L to (5,1) on turn 63 action.\n\nThen on turn 64, head at (5,1), move L to (4,1) on turn 64 action.\n\nThen on turn 65, head at (4,1), and positions as above.\n\nFrom (4,1), the only cell that might be free is if the tail moves, but tail is at (3,2), not adjacent.\n\n(4,1) to (4,2) is up, occupied.\n\n to (3,1) wall.\n\n to (4,0) wall.\n\n to (5,1) occupied.\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied, and it's not the tail, so when the snake moves, that segment will move to another position, but the cell (4,2) will be occupied by the segment that moves there, but for the head moving to it, it's still occupied at the time of move.\n\nUnless the head is moving to the tail position, which is allowed because the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAh, yes! I forgot that.\n\nSo if the head moves to the tail position, it's safe because the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nIn this case, from (4,1), moving U to (4,2) – is (4,2) the tail?\n\nIn the positions, after the move to (4,1), tail is at (3,2), not (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is at index 15, which is not tail; tail is index 16 at (3,2).\n\nSo (4,2) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (4,2) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is index 1, not tail.\n\nSo no, moving to (4,2) is collision.\n\nPerhaps on turn 64, when at (5,1), I could have moved differently, but on turn 64, from (5,1), only L to (4,1) was possible, as U, D, R were all invalid.\n\nU to (5,2) occupied, D wall, R instant reverse and occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,1).\n\nThen at (4,1), all moves seem bad.\n\nBut let's list the grid at turn 65 start.\n\nGrid size 8x8, x0 to7, y0 to7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,1)\n\nFood: (2,4) with life span 3 at turn 63, so at turn 65, life span: at turn 63, countdown 3, after turn 63, 2, after turn 64, 1, so at turn 65, countdown 1, present.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) countdown at turn 63:5, after 63:4, after 64:3, so at turn 65, countdown 3, present.\n\n(6,3) countdown 8 at 63, after 63:7, after 64:6, so at 65 countdown 6, present.\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied by snake body, so not accessible yet.\n\nNow snake at turn 65 start: head at (4,1), positions as above.\n\nCells around (4,1):\n\n- North (U): (4,2) - occupied by snake body (index 15)\n\n- South (D): (4,0) - wall\n\n- West (L): (3,1) - wall\n\n- East (R): (5,1) - occupied by snake body (index 1)\n\nAll adjacent cells are either wall or occupied by non-tail body segments, so no possible move without collision. But that means the snake is trapped and will die on this turn. But the game must be playable, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nPerhaps at turn 63, when at (6,1), I could move left to (5,1), but is there another way? No, only left was possible.\n\nOr perhaps the direction allows something.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (6,3) is on the body, but it can be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there, but for now, not relevant.\n\nBut at (4,1), it seems stuck.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells at turn 65 start.\n\nSnake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nSo occupied: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nWalls: (3,1), and borders.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,0) wall, (5,0) wall, etc., but from (4,1), only (4,2), (3,1), (5,1), (4,0) are adjacent, all blocked.\n\n(3,1) is wall, (4,0) wall, (4,2) occupied, (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo indeed, no move possible; snake dies on turn 65.\n\nBut that can't be right for the problem; perhaps I have a mistake in the initial move.\n\nAt turn 63, head at (6,1), direction D.\n\nI said only move L to (5,1) is possible, but let's double-check.\n\nFrom (6,1):\n\n- U: to (6,2) - occupied and instant reverse not allowed (since current direction D, opposite U)\n\n- D: to (6,0) - wall\n\n- L: to (5,1) - free\n\n- R: to (7,1) - wall\n\nSo only L possible.\n\nThen at (5,1), only L to (4,1) possible.\n\nThen at (4,1), stuck.\n\nBut perhaps the snake can move to a food cell or something, but no free cells.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (6,3) is on the body, but at turn 63, when the snake moves, the body might move, freeing cells.\n\nAt turn 63, after moving to (5,1), the position (6,3) is still occupied, but the segment that was at (6,3) moves to (6,2), so (6,3) is free only if no other segment is there, but in the new positions, (6,3) is occupied by the segment that was at (6,4) moving to it.\n\nAfter move to (5,1), positions include (6,3) at new index 3.\n\nSo occupied.\n\nPerhaps on turn 64, from (5,1), I could have moved up or down, but U to (5,2) is occupied, D to (5,0) wall, so no.\n\nUnless (5,2) is the tail or something, but at that time, tail is at (2,2), not (5,2).\n\nAt turn 64 start, head at (5,1), body includes (5,2) at index 13, not tail.\n\nTail is (2,2).\n\nSo moving U to (5,2) would collide with body.\n\nSo I think the snake is indeed trapped on turn 65.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; perhaps I misread the snake positions.\n\nLet's look back at the initial state.\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1,3)]\n\nSo head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), tail (1,3).\n\nNow, from (6,1), only move to (5,1) is safe.\n\nAfter that, snake moves to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) and tail (1,2) or (1,3) removed? After move, tail removed, so positions from (5,1) to (2,2), 16 positions? Earlier calculation.\n\nHead (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) – 16 positions, yes.\n\nThen from (5,1), move to (4,1).\n\nAfter that, head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) – 17 positions? Head (4,1), then 16 body, but when moving, tail removed, so 16 positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) – that's 17, but should be 16 since no food.\n\nFrom 16 positions before, after move, new head, and body segments, tail removed, so 16 positions.\n\nBefore move at turn 64 start: 16 positions.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), new head (4,1), then the first body segment moves to old head position (5,1), then each subsequent to previous position, so the last body segment before tail is removed.\n\nOld positions: 0: (5,1), 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (4,6), 9: (4,5), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,3), 12: (5,3), 13: (5,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (3,2)  // 16 positions, index 0 to 15, tail at (3,2)\n\nAfter move to (4,1):\n\n- New 0: (4,1)\n\n- New 1: old index 0 moves to new position? No, new position 1: the segment that was at old index 1 moves to old position of index 0, which is (5,1)\n\n- New 2: old index 2 moves to old position of index 1, (6,1)\n\n- New 3: old index 3 to old pos index 2, (6,2)\n\n- New 4: old index 4 to old pos index 3, (6,3)\n\n- New 5: old index 5 to old pos index 4, (6,4)\n\n- New 6: old index 6 to old pos index 5, (6,5)\n\n- New 7: old index 7 to old pos index 6, (6,6)\n\n- New 8: old index 8 to old pos index 7, (5,6)\n\n- New 9: old index 9 to old pos index 8, (4,6)\n\n- New 10: old index 10 to old pos index 9, (4,5)\n\n- New 11: old index 11 to old pos index 10, (4,4)\n\n- New 12: old index 12 to old pos index 11, (4,3)\n\n- New 13: old index 13 to old pos index 12, (5,3)\n\n- New 14: old index 14 to old pos index 13, (5,2)\n\n- New 15: old index 15 to old pos index 14, (4,2)\n\nOld index 15 was at (3,2), and it moves to old pos of index 14, which is (4,2)\n\nBut old index 14 was (4,2), so new position 15 is (4,2)\n\nAnd there is no new position for old index 15 to move to old pos of index 14, which is (4,2), so new position 15: (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) was occupied, but it's moving to it, and the previous occupant moved away.\n\nThe cell (4,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at (3,2).\n\nBut for the head, from (4,1) moving to (4,2) is not possible because (4,2) is occupied by this body segment.\n\nThe only way it could be safe is if it was the tail, but here it's not the tail; the tail was removed.\n\nIn this case, new positions: new 0: (4,1), new 1: (5,1), new 2: (6,1), new 3: (6,2), new 4: (6,3), new 5: (6,4), new 6: (6,5), new 7: (6,6), new 8: (5,6), new 9: (4,6), new 10: (4,5), new 11: (4,4), new 12: (4,3), new 13: (5,3), new 14: (5,2), new 15: (4,2)  // 16 positions, tail at (4,2)\n\nTail at new index 15: (4,2)\n\nFor turn 65, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) – (4,2) is occupied by the tail! So moving to tail position is allowed because the tail will move away.\n\n- D: to (4,0) wall\n\n- L: to (3,1) wall\n\n- R: to (5,1) – (5,1) is occupied by body, index 1, not tail, so collision.\n\nAlso, moving R is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,2) or L to wall or D wall or R not allowed.\n\nL to (3,1) wall, so only U to (4,2) is possible, and since it's the tail, it should be safe.\n\nI forgot that moving to tail position is allowed.\n\nSo on turn 65, move U to (4,2).\n\nThen, since (4,2) has food? Food positions: (2,4), (1,5), (6,3), no food at (4,2), so no eating, just move.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), new head at (4,2), and the tail was at (4,2), but since head moves there, and tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,2), then the body segments move.\n\nOld positions before move: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), tail (4,2)\n\nMove U to (4,2):\n\n- New head at (4,2)\n\n- But (4,2) was the tail, so when head moves there, the tail is eaten or something? No, if no food, the tail is removed, but here head is moving to the tail position.\n\nSince no food at (4,2), the snake doesn't grow, so the tail is removed, and the head occupies (4,2).\n\nNew positions: head at (4,2)\n\nThen the segment that was at old index 1 moves to old head position (4,1)\n\nThen old index 2 to old pos index 1 (5,1)\n\nAnd so on, up to the segment before tail.\n\nOld index 15 was tail at (4,2), but head moved there, so it is removed.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- New 0: (4,2) head\n\n- New 1: old index 1 moved to old pos 0, (4,1)\n\n- New 2: old index 2 moved to old pos 1, (5,1)\n\n- New 3: old index 3 to old pos 2, (6,1)\n\n- New 4: old index 4 to old pos 3, (6,2)\n\n- New 5: old index 5 to old pos 4, (6,3)\n\n- New 6: old index 6 to old pos 5, (6,4)\n\n- New 7: old index 7 to old pos 6, (6,5)\n\n- New 8: old index 8 to old pos 7, (6,6)\n\n- New 9: old index 9 to old pos 8, (5,6)\n\n- New 10: old index 10 to old pos 9, (4,6)\n\n- New 11: old index 11 to old pos 10, (4,5)\n\n- New 12: old index 12 to old pos 11, (4,4)\n\n- New 13: old index 13 to old pos 12, (4,3)\n\n- New 14: old index 14 to old pos 13, (5,3)\n\n- New 15: old index 15 to old pos 14, (5,2)  // old index 15 was at (4,2), but it moves to old pos of index 14, which is (5,2)? Old pos of index 14 is (5,2), but new position for old index 15 is to old pos of index 14, which is (5,2)\n\nBut old index 14 was at (5,2), so new position 15: (5,2)\n\nAnd there is no new position for old index 15 since it was tail, but in this case, old index 15 was tail, and it moves to old pos of index 14, but since no new segment, new tail is at new position 15: (5,2)\n\nList:\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), then:\n\n- new 1: (4,1)\n\n- new 2: (5,1)\n\n- new 3: (6,1)\n\n- new 4: (6,2)\n\n- new 5: (6,3)\n\n- new 6: (6,4)\n\n- new 7: (6,5)\n\n- new 8: (6,6)\n\n- new 9: (5,6)\n\n- new 10: (4,6)\n\n- new 11: (4,5)\n\n- new 12: (4,4)\n\n- new 13: (4,3)\n\n- new 14: (5,3)\n\n- new 15: (5,2)  // tail\n\nLength 16.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction U (since moved up from (4,1)).\n\nNow for turn 66, I need to decide action.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,3) – what is (4,3)? In positions, (4,3) is at new index 13? Positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nSo (4,3) is at index 13, body segment, occupied.\n\n- D: to (4,1) – (4,1) is occupied, index 1, body. Also, moving down is instant reverse, since current direction U, opposite D, not allowed.\n\n- L: to (3,2) – is (3,2) free? Not in positions, and not wall. Walls are (3,1), but (3,2) should be free.\n\n- R: to (5,2) – (5,2) is occupied, index 15, tail.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,3) occupied, but not tail; D not allowed; L to (3,2) free; R to (5,2) which is tail, so allowed.\n\nAlso, current direction U, so moving L or R is allowed, not opposite.\n\nSo options: L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nNow, (5,2) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (2,4) with life span 3 at turn 63, so at turn 65, countdown 1, so after turn 65, it disappears, so not present on turn 66.\n\nAt turn 65 start, countdown for (2,4) is 1, after turn 65, countdown 0, disappears, so not on turn 66.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) at turn 65 countdown 3, present on turn 66.\n\n(6,3) countdown 6, present.\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied by snake, so not accessible yet.\n\nSo on turn 66, available food: (1,5) at (1,5), and (6,3) but occupied.\n\n(1,5) is free.\n\nNow, from head at (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf move R to (5,2), it's the tail, so safe, but no food there, so just move, tail moves away.\n\nThen new head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nIf move L to (3,2), new head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards food.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is near (1,2) or something.\n\nLet's plan ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 66, head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), then head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1) wall, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) occupied or instant reverse? Current direction L, so R is instant reverse not allowed.\n\nU to (3,3) should be free.\n\nL to (2,2) – (2,2) might be free or not.\n\nIn current positions, (2,2) is not occupied, snake is at (4,2) down to (5,2), no (2,2).\n\nWalls only at (3,1), so (2,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) free.\n\nSo from (3,2), can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nThen to reach (1,5), I can go via (2,2) to (1,2) or something.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), so need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I move L to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nThen from (2,2), can move U to (2,3), L to (1,2), D to (2,1) or R to (3,2) instant reverse not allowed.\n\n(2,3) should be free, (1,2) might be free, (2,1) free.\n\nThen to (1,5), from (2,2) move to (1,2), then to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nBut (1,2) and (1,3) might be occupied later, but now free.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,3) first.\n\nBut food at (1,5) has life span 5 at turn 63, so at turn 66, countdown: at turn 63:5, after 63:4, after 64:3, after 65:2, so at turn 66, countdown 2, present until after turn 67.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,3), but it's on the body, so when the body moves away, it can be eaten.\n\nFor example, in the current position, (6,3) is occupied, but as the snake moves, it might be freed.\n\nFor instance, if I move towards the left, the tail is moving, so (6,3) might be freed later.\n\nBut let's focus on turn 63 to 65 first.\n\nBack to turn 63.\n\nOn turn 63, I must move L to (5,1).\n\nThen on turn 64, from (5,1), move L to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 65, from (4,1), move U to (4,2).\n\nNow for turn 66, from (4,2), direction U, I can move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nNow, moving to (5,2) is the tail, so it's safe, but after moving, the tail moves away, so (5,2) is free for a moment, but head is there.\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), new head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2) instant reverse not allowed (since current R, opposite L), R to (6,2).\n\n(5,3) is occupied, in positions index 14: (5,3)\n\n(5,1) is occupied, index 2: (5,1)\n\n(6,2) is occupied, index 4: (6,2)\n\n(4,2) is head, but moving L to it not allowed.\n\nSo all adjacent cells occupied or not allowed, and (5,3), (5,1), (6,2) are body, not tail, so moving to them collision.\n\nTail is at (5,2), but head is moving there, so after move, tail moves away.\n\nBut from (5,2), moving U to (5,3) occupied, D to (5,1) occupied, R to (6,2) occupied, L not allowed.\n\nSo no move possible, death.\n\nTherefore, moving R to (5,2) on turn 66 is bad because it leads to trap.\n\nBetter to move L to (3,2) on turn 66.\n\nSo from (4,2), move L to (3,2).\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nNow for turn 67, head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1) wall, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf U to (3,3), or L to (2,2).\n\nFood at (1,5) is at (1,5), so I need to go left and up.\n\nAlso, food at (2,4) is gone by turn 66.\n\n(2,4) life span 3 at turn 63, after turn 65 it disappears, so not present turn 66.\n\n(1,5) present until after turn 67? At turn 66, countdown 2, after turn 66:1, after turn 67:0, gone on turn 68.\n\nSo to eat (1,5), I need to be there by turn 67.\n\nOn turn 66, head at (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), then on turn 67 from (2,2) move L to (1,2), then on turn 68 move U to (1,3), but (1,3) might be free, then to (1,4), (1,5), but on turn 68, (1,5) may be gone if countdown 0 after turn 67.\n\nAt turn 66, countdown for (1,5) is 2, so present on turn 66 and 67, disappears after turn 67, so not on turn 68.\n\nSo I need to eat it on turn 67 or earlier.\n\nOn turn 66, head at (3,2), if I move L to (2,2), then on turn 67, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2) or D to (2,1), etc.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), so from (2,2), moving directly to (1,2) then to (1,3), but (1,5) is at y=5, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5), but on turn 67, from (2,2) I can move to (1,2), then on turn 68 to (1,3), but (1,5) gone on turn 68, so too late.\n\nOn turn 67, if I am at (1,2), I can move to (1,3), but (1,5) is not eaten.\n\nTo eat on turn 67, I need to be at (1,5) on turn 67.\n\nFrom turn 66 head at (3,2), to (1,5) in one move? No, not adjacent.\n\nMinimum two moves: to (2,2) then to (1,2), but (1,2) is not (1,5).\n\nFrom (3,2) to (1,5) is not direct.\n\nPaths: from (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (1,4) to (1,5) or something, but that takes multiple turns.\n\nOn turn 66, at (3,2), if I move U to (3,3), then on turn 67 to (3,4) or (2,3), etc, still far from (1,5).\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 67; the closest I can be on turn 67 is (1,2) or (2,3), etc, but (1,5) is at distance |3-1| + |2-5| = 2+3=5, so at least 5 moves away, but from turn 66 to 67 only one move, so on turn 67 I can be at most at (2,2) or (3,3), which is not close to (1,5).\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,5) before it disappears; it will be gone after turn 67.\n\nSo I should ignore it and focus on other food or survival.\n\nThere is food at (6,3) with life span 8, so it will be around for a while.\n\nBut it's currently under the snake body at (6,3), so I need to free it by moving the body away.\n\nIn the current snake configuration, after turn 65, head at (4,2), positions include (6,3) at index 5.\n\nAs the snake moves left, the body will shift, and (6,3) might be freed.\n\nFor example, if I continue moving left and up.\n\nOn turn 66, from (4,2) move L to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 67, from (3,2) I can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nSay I move U to (3,3).\n\nHead at (3,3), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 68, from (3,3) can move U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D to (3,2) instant reverse not allowed.\n\n(3,4) free, (2,3) free, (4,3) occupied? In positions, after previous moves.\n\nBut I need to think about the food at (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is currently occupied, but as the snake moves, when the segment moves away, it becomes free, and if head moves there, it can be eaten.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves such that the body at (6,3) moves, and later head goes to (6,3).\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nBut for now, at turn 63, I must move L to (5,1) on turn 63.\n\nThen on turn 64, move L to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 65, move U to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 66, from (4,2) move L to (3,2) to avoid the trap with R.\n\nThen on turn 67, from (3,2) move U to (3,3) to go towards the center or to free space.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut since the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize survival, and in this case, on early turns, I have only one choice, so I should output that.\n\nFor turn 63: action L\n\nTurn 64: action L\n\nTurn 65: action U\n\nTurn 66: action L (to (3,2))\n\nThen for turn 67, head at (3,2), direction L, move U to (3,3)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, so perhaps for the next few turns where choices exist.\n\nFrom turn 66 onwards, I have choices.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but for output, it might be for the current turn and some ahead.\n\nThe answer format is: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSince at turn 63,64,65, I have only one action each, I can output those.\n\nFor turn 66, I have a choice, so I need to decide.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should try to eat food.\n\nFood at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is in the body, and as I move left, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, after moving to (3,2) on turn 66, the positions shift.\n\nLet's simulate the positions after turn 66 move.\n\nOn turn 66, from head at (4,2), move L to (3,2).\n\nBefore move, positions: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2) tail at (5,2)\n\nMove to (3,2):\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- New body: old index 1 moves to old head position (4,2)\n\nThen old index 2 to old pos index 1 (4,1)\n\nOld index 3 to old pos index 2 (5,1)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- New 0: (3,2)\n\n- New 1: old index 1 to (4,2)\n\n- New 2: old index 2 to (4,1)\n\n- New 3: old index 3 to (5,1)\n\n- New 4: old index 4 to (6,1)\n\n- New 5: old index 5 to (6,2)\n\n- New 6: old index 6 to (6,3)\n\n- New 7: old index 7 to (6,4)\n\n- New 8: old index 8 to (6,5)\n\n- New 9: old index 9 to (6,6)\n\n- New 10: old index 10 to (5,6)\n\n- New 11: old index 11 to (4,6)\n\n- New 12: old index 12 to (4,5)\n\n- New 13: old index 13 to (4,4)\n\n- New 14: old index 14 to (4,3)\n\n- New 15: old index 15 to (5,3)  // tail\n\nHead at (3,2), direction L.\n\n(6,3) is at new index 6, still occupied.\n\nBut as I move, it will eventually be freed.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,3) on turn 67, then the body shifts, and (6,3) might be the tail or something later.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nFood at (1,5) is about to disappear, so not worth pursuing.\n\nSo for survival, moving to open space is fine.\n\nSo for the output, since at turn 63,64,65 only one choice, I can output:\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nTurn 64: L\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nThen for turn 66, from (4,2), I have a choice between L and R, but R leads to death, so must move L.\n\nSo turn 66: L\n\nThen turn 67: from (3,2), move U or L, say U to (3,3) for example.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the problem asks to think ahead for score, but in this case, no food can be eaten immediately, so survival first.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide actions for turn 63 to 67.\n\nTurn 63: L\n\nTurn 64: L\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: L\n\nTurn 67: U (to (3,3))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the box, perhaps just for the turns where action is taken.\n\nThe state is at turn 63, so actions from turn 63 onwards.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nBut in the output, just the action.\n\nSo for turn 63: L (left)\n\nTurn 64: L (left)\n\nTurn 65: U (up)\n\nTurn 66: L (left)\n\nTurn 67: U (up)\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Strategy\n\n**Current Turn:** 63  \n**Grid Size:** 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (3,1))  \n**Snake Position:** Head at (6,1), with 18 segments. Head direction is down (D).  \n**Food:**  \n- (2,4): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 65)  \n- (1,5): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 67)  \n- (6,3): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 70), but currently under snake body and cannot be eaten immediately.\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**  \n- At turn 63, head is at (6,1) with direction D. Moving down (D) to (6,0) hits a wall. Moving up (U) is instant reverse (not allowed) and leads to body collision at (6,2). Moving right (R) to (7,1) hits a wall. Only left (L) to (5,1) is safe.  \n- After moving to (5,1) on turn 63, the snake must move left (L) to (4,1) on turn 64 to avoid collisions (other moves are invalid).  \n- On turn 65, head at (4,1) with direction L. Moving left to (3,1) hits an internal wall. Moving down to (4,0) hits a wall. Moving right (R) is instant reverse and leads to body collision. Moving up (U) to (4,2) is safe because (4,2) is the tail segment—the tail moves away, preventing collision.  \n- On turn 66, head at (4,2) with direction U. Moving down (D) is instant reverse (not allowed). Moving up (U) to (4,3) causes body collision. Moving right (R) to (5,2) is possible (tail segment), but leads to a dead end on turn 67 (all adjacent cells blocked). Moving left (L) to (3,2) is safe and opens paths for future movement.  \n- Food at (1,5) cannot be reached before it disappears after turn 67 (distance too great). Food at (2,4) disappears after turn 65 and is unreachable. Food at (6,3) is under the body but may become accessible later as the snake moves.  \n- **Long-term priority:** Survival is critical. After turn 66, moving left to (3,2) avoids dead ends. Then, moving up to (3,3) on turn 67 explores open space, potentially freeing (6,3) for later consumption.\n\n**Action Plan for Turns 63-67 (5 turns ahead):**  \n- **Turn 63:** Move left (L) to (5,1) — only safe option.  \n- **Turn 64:** Move left (L) to (4,1) — only safe option.  \n- **Turn 65:** Move up (U) to (4,2) — safe (moving to tail position).  \n- **Turn 66:** Move left (L) to (3,2) — avoids dead end; enables future movement.  \n- **Turn 67:** Move up (U) to (3,3) — explores open space; positions snake for potential food access later.\n\n**Rationale for 5+ Turns Ahead:**  \n- Beyond turn 67, the snake can navigate toward the center (e.g., (3,4) or (2,3)) to free space and access (6,3) when the body moves away. Survival is prioritized over immediate food, as no positive food is reachable within 5 turns without risk.  \n- Risks are minimized by avoiding walls, body collisions, and instant reverses. The path to (3,3) is low-risk and maintains flexibility.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 63: L \\\\\nTurn 64: L \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: L \\\\\nTurn 67: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 64, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,1), and it's moving left. The body segments are listed: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)]. Let me plot this to visualize.\n\nStarting from head: (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2). That's 18 segments. Since head is at (5,1) and direction is left, it just moved to (5,1) from (6,1), I assume, because previous position would be right of head if moving left.\n\nSnake head direction is L, so it's facing left, meaning it came from the right. So before turn 64, head was at (6,1), and it moved left to (5,1). Now, at turn 64, head is at (5,1), moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,4) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span given.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 64, life span is as given. For (2,4), life span 2, so it disappears after 2 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn.\n\nLet me read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it lasts from turn t to turn t + L - 1, I think. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, then at turn t+1, it's L-1, ..., down to 0, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But typically, if countdown is K at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + K - 1 or something. I need to be precise.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span N. Then, after N turns, it disappears. Since countdown decreases including current turn, at turn t, countdown = N, at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, countdown =1, and after that turn, it disappears, so it's not available on turn t + N.\n\nFor example, if N=2 at turn 64, then at turn 64, countdown=2, available; turn 65, countdown=1, available; after turn 65, it disappears, so not on turn 66.\n\nSimilarly, for N=4 at (1,5), available from turn 64 to 67.\n\nN=7 at (6,3), available from 64 to 70.\n\nN=10 at (5,6), available from 64 to 73.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,1), moving left. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,1). Neighbors:\n\n- Left: (4,1) — is this valid? x=4, y=1. Walls: borders at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1) is within bounds. Internal obstacle at (3,1), which is not (4,1), so (4,1) should be free.\n\n(4,1) is not in snake body? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n\nSo cells occupied: all these.\n\n(4,1) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm: (4,1) is not mentioned, and no wall there, so yes.\n\n- Up: (5,2) — but (5,2) is part of snake body, specifically the 14th segment? Positions: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), ..., 12: (5,3), 13: (5,2)? Let's order the list.\n\nThe list is head first: index 0: (5,1)\n\n1: (6,1)\n\n2: (6,2)\n\n3: (6,3)\n\n4: (6,4)\n\n5: (6,5)\n\n6: (6,6)\n\n7: (5,6)\n\n8: (4,6)\n\n9: (4,5)\n\n10: (4,4)\n\n11: (4,3)\n\n12: (5,3)\n\n13: (5,2)\n\n14: (4,2)\n\n15: (3,2)\n\n16: (2,2)\n\n17: (1,2)\n\nSo (5,2) is at index 13, which is body, not head.\n\nMoving up to (5,2) would be colliding with body, since head touches (5,2), which is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, down: (5,0) — but y=0 is wall, so out of bounds or wall, cannot move there.\n\nLeft: (4,1) — not occupied, not wall.\n\nRight: (6,1) — but that's the second segment, and also moving right would be opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: Left to (4,1), Up to (5,2) but occupied, invalid, Down to (5,0) wall, invalid. So only possible move is Left to (4,1)? But is there another option?\n\nI can move Up, Down, Left, Right except opposite direction.\n\nBut Up is to (5,2), which is occupied, so collision.\n\nDown to (5,0) is wall.\n\nRight is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only Left to (4,1) is possible? But (4,1) should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(4,1): x=4, y=1, not border, not obstacle (obstacle at (3,1)), so free cell.\n\nNot in snake positions, so yes, only move is Left to (4,1).\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Is (4,1) really free? Snake positions don't have (4,1), walls don't, so yes.\n\nBut let me see the food: food at (2,4), (1,5), (6,3), (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is part of snake? Snake has (5,6) at index 7, so it's occupied by body, but food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten when body moves away and head moves in.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is also a body segment, index 3.\n\nBut for now, at turn 64, head is at (5,1), moving left, only move to (4,1).\n\nBut if I move left to (4,1), then turn 64 action is L.\n\nThen, snake moves: head to (4,1), tail? Tail is at (1,2), which will move to the next segment? When snake moves, if not eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous one, so tail is removed.\n\nSo after moving left to (4,1), new positions: head at (4,1), then body: previous head (5,1) becomes new segment 1, then (6,1) becomes segment 2, (6,2) segment 3, and so on, up to (2,2) segment 17, and tail (1,2) is removed since no growth.\n\nSo new snake: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)] and (1,2) is gone.\n\nLength was 18, no food eaten, so length 18 still.\n\nNow, at turn 65, head at (4,1), direction: since it moved left, direction is now L.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,1), neighbors:\n\n- Left: (3,1) — but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\n- Up: (4,2) — (4,2) is part of snake body? New positions: (4,2) is at index 16? List: index 0: (4,1) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (4,4), 12: (4,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (5,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (3,2), 17: (2,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is index 15, which is body, so moving up to (4,2) would collide.\n\n- Down: (4,0) — y=0 wall, cannot.\n\n- Right: (5,1) — which is the new segment 1, occupied, and also moving right would be opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, moving right is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: Left to wall, invalid; Up to body, invalid; Down to wall, invalid; Right opposite direction, invalid. No possible move? That can't be right.\n\nI think I made a mistake.\n\nAt turn 64, after moving to (4,1), the direction is left, so for turn 65, from (4,1), moving right to (5,1) is not opposite? Current direction is L, meaning head is facing left, so moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nBut (5,1) is occupied by the body, so even if allowed, it's occupied.\n\nOther directions: Up to (4,2) is occupied, Down to (4,0) wall, Left to (3,1) wall.\n\nSo indeed, no safe move at turn 65 if I moved left at turn 64. That means moving left at turn 64 leads to death at turn 65, because no valid moves.\n\nBut that can't be; I must have misread the snake positions.\n\nLet me double-check the initial snake positions at turn 64.\n\nSnake: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)]\n\nHead at (5,1), direction L.\n\nAfter moving left to (4,1), new head at (4,1), then body: (5,1) which was head, now body, then (6,1), (6,2), ..., up to (1,2) but since no growth, tail (1,2) is removed, so the last segment is (2,2).\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nNow at (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- Left (3,1): wall, invalid\n\n- Up (4,2): occupied by snake, as (4,2) is in the list, index 15 in new list? Let's index: 0: (4,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (4,4), 12: (4,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (5,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (3,2), 17: (2,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is at index 15, yes occupied.\n\n- Down (4,0): y=0 wall\n\n- Right (5,1): occupied by index 1, and also moving right is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n\nSo no valid moves, snake dies. But that means at turn 64, moving left is not possible because it leads to immediate death next turn.\n\nBut at turn 64, moving left to (4,1) is possible, but it traps the snake.\n\nAre there other moves? Earlier I thought only left is possible, but up is occupied, down wall, right opposite.\n\nBut is up really occupied? At turn 64, head at (5,1), up is (5,2), which is in the body, index 13: (5,2), yes.\n\nDown (5,0) wall.\n\nRight (6,1) is body and opposite direction.\n\nSo at turn 64, the only possible move is to (4,1), but that causes a problem next turn.\n\nUnless... is (4,1) free? Yes, but after moving, at turn 65, it's stuck.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to a cell that will be free after tail moves, but in this case, at turn 65, from (4,1), the cells are all blocked.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that at turn 64, moving left is the only choice, but it leads to death, so I have to do it, but that can't be right for the game.\n\nPerhaps I misread the direction. Head direction is L, but maybe I can turn.\n\nAnother idea: the direction constraint is only for the next move, not that I can't ever reverse, but I can't do instant reverse on the very next turn.\n\nAt turn 64, current direction L, so I can move L, U, or D, but not R.\n\nU and D are not possible as per above, only L.\n\nBut L leads to trap.\n\nUnless there is food or something, but no food at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps the internal wall at (3,1) is not affecting (4,1), but at (4,1), left is (3,1) wall.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the snake positions or something.\n\nLet me list all snake positions to see if (4,1) is occupied or not at turn 64.\n\nTurn 64 positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n\n(4,1) is not in this list, so it's free.\n\nBut after moving to (4,1), the body includes (5,1), which is just behind, but at (4,1), the adjacent cells are blocked as above.\n\nPerhaps at turn 65, when I move, the tail moves, so some cells become free, but at turn 65, from (4,1), the cell (4,2) is occupied, but after I move, the tail moves, so (4,2) might be free if I move away, but at the time of move, (4,2) is occupied, so I can't move into it.\n\nCollision is checked when the head moves to a cell; if that cell is occupied by body or wall at that time, it collides.\n\nAt turn 65, before moving, the snake occupies those cells, including (4,2), (5,1), etc.\n\nSo from head at (4,1), moving to (4,2) is invalid because (4,2) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo indeed, moving left at turn 64 leads to certain death at turn 65.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; perhaps I have a wrong understanding.\n\nAnother possibility: the head direction constraint. When it says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", but at turn 64, current direction is L, so I can move L, U, or D.\n\nBut U and D are invalid, so only L.\n\nPerhaps for U, (5,2) is the tail or something, but no, (5,2) is not the tail; tail is (1,2), far away.\n\n(5,2) is a body segment, not the tail, so colliding.\n\nUnless the head can move to the tail position if the tail is moving away, but the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nLet's read the collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it is allowed, because when the snake moves, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other body segments, it would collide.\n\nIn this case, at turn 64, head at (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- Left to (4,1): not occupied, not tail, so safe if free.\n\n- Up to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied, is it the tail? Tail is (1,2), so (5,2) is not tail, it's a body segment, so moving there would collide.\n\n- Down to (5,0): wall, invalid.\n\n- Right to (6,1): occupied, and it's the second segment, not tail, and also opposite direction, so invalid for both reasons.\n\nSo only left to (4,1) is possible.\n\nBut at turn 65, after moving to (4,1), head at (4,1), tail is at (2,2)? After turn 64 move, tail is at (2,2), as (1,2) is removed.\n\nAt turn 65, head at (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- Left to (3,1): wall, invalid\n\n- Up to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied; is it the tail? Tail is at (2,2), so (4,2) is not tail, it's body, so moving to (4,2) would collide.\n\n- Down to (4,0): wall\n\n- Right to (5,1): (5,1) is occupied; is it the tail? No, tail is (2,2), so (5,1) is body, and moving right is opposite to current direction L, so invalid.\n\nNo valid moves.\n\nBut (4,2) is not tail, so no.\n\nUnless in the new position, at turn 65, the cell (4,2) is occupied by a segment that is not the tail, so collision.\n\nSo the snake is trapped if it moves left at turn 64.\n\nBut that means at turn 64, there is no safe move, which is strange.\n\nPerhaps I can move up or down, but at turn 64, up to (5,2) is occupied, down to (5,0) wall.\n\nUnless (5,2) is the tail, but it's not; tail is (1,2).\n\nLet's check the distance: head at (5,1), tail at (1,2), not adjacent.\n\nSo I think the only move is left, but it leads to death, so for the sake of the game, I have to do it, but then the snake dies at turn 65.\n\nBut the AI should avoid risks, so perhaps I need to find a way to eat food or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at turn 64, moving up to (5,2) is possible if it's the tail, but it's not the tail; the tail is (1,2), so (5,2) is a body segment.\n\nLet's list the positions in order: from head (5,1) to tail (1,2), the path is: (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2)\n\nSo (5,2) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (5,2) would cause head to touch body, collision.\n\nSimilarly, all other directions are invalid.\n\nSo the only possible move at turn 64 is left to (4,1), which then at turn 65 leaves no move, so snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be right for the state given; perhaps I misread the food or something.\n\nFood at (2,4), etc., but not near head.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to a food cell that is under the body, but for that, the body must move away first, but at the current turn, if the head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, unless it's the tail.\n\nThe rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for eating, the head can only move to the food cell when it's free, not when occupied.\n\nAt turn 64, no food at head position, so no eating.\n\nI think I have to accept that at turn 64, the only move is L to (4,1), and then at turn 65, it's stuck, so the game ends.\n\nBut that seems odd; perhaps the grid is larger or I missed a cell.\n\nAnother thought: the internal obstacle at (3,1) is a wall, so (3,1) is blocked.\n\nBut at (4,1), left is (3,1) wall.\n\nPerhaps the snake can turn at turn 64, but no other moves are possible.\n\nUnless I can move down, but (5,0) is y=0, wall.\n\nOr up, occupied.\n\nSo I think I have to move left and face the consequence.\n\nBut for the AI, it should avoid such situations, but here it's unavoidable.\n\nPerhaps at turn 64, moving left is not the only choice; let's think about the direction constraint.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so I can move U, D, or L, but U and D are invalid, so only L.\n\nSo for turn 64, action must be L.\n\nThen at turn 65, as above, no move, so the snake dies.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but if it dies at turn 65, I can only provide turn 64 action.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but here it's short.\n\nPerhaps I miscalculated the snake positions.\n\nLet's count the segments: positions have 18 elements, so length 18.\n\nAfter move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) — that's 18 positions, tail at (2,2).\n\nAt (4,1), adjacent cells: (3,1) wall, (4,2) body (index 15 in this list, (4,2) is occupied), (4,0) wall, (5,1) body (index 1, occupied).\n\nNo tail adjacent, so no move.\n\nSo for turn 64, only action is L.\n\nThen for turn 65, no action possible, snake dies.\n\nBut since the AI needs to output actions, perhaps for turn 64: L, and that's it.\n\nBut the format says to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so if it dies, I can't provide further actions.\n\nBut let's assume that at turn 64, I must move L, and then it ends.\n\nBut I think there might be a mistake in the state or my understanding.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the head can move to (4,1), and at turn 65, if I move up to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied, but if it is the tail, it might be allowed, but in this case, at turn 65, the tail is at (2,2), so (4,2) is not tail.\n\nThe cell (4,2) is occupied by a body segment, not the tail, so collision.\n\nUnless after the move, the tail moves, but at the time of move, the cell is occupied.\n\nThe rule is clear: \"head touches any body segment\" except when moving to the tail cell.\n\nHere, (4,2) is not the tail cell.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps at turn 64, I can move in a different direction if I consider the direction change.\n\nCurrent direction L, so I can turn to U or D.\n\nBut U to (5,2) is occupied, D to (5,0) wall.\n\nSo no.\n\nUnless (5,2) is not occupied for some reason, but it is.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells at turn 64: from the positions, (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied, so head at (5,1) cannot move up to (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, no other options.\n\nSo I have to move left.\n\nPerhaps for the sake of the problem, I should move left and then see for future turns, but it dies immediately.\n\nBut let's look at the food: there is food at (6,3) with life span 7, but it's under the body, so I can eat it later if I move the body away.\n\nBut at turn 64, head is at (5,1), far from it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) has food but occupied.\n\nBut for now, at turn 64, only move is L to (4,1).\n\nThen at turn 65, as above, no move.\n\nUnless at turn 65, from (4,1), I can move right to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied by the body, and moving right is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n\nIf it were the tail, it might be allowed, but it's not.\n\nSo I think I have to accept that and provide only turn 64 action.\n\nBut let's check the tail position at turn 65.\n\nAfter turn 64 move to (4,1), tail was (1,2), removed, new tail is (2,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), the only possible cell to move is if (4,2) were tail, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps over time, the tail moves, but at turn 65, it's stuck.\n\nI think I need to proceed with turn 64: L.\n\nThen for turn 65, no action, but since the format requires actions, perhaps I can't provide.\n\nPerhaps for turn 64, I can choose to not move, but the rule is I must move one cell each turn.\n\nSo I think for the answer, I'll provide turn 64: L, and that's it.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to survive.\n\nAnother thought: the internal obstacle at (3,1) is given, but perhaps it's not a wall for movement, but the description says \"cells occupied by walls\", and internal obstacles are walls, so (3,1) is wall.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (4,1) and then at turn 65, since (4,2) is not the tail, but if I move up, it collides, so no.\n\nI think I have to move left at turn 64.\n\nSo for turn 64, action: L.\n\nThen for turn 65, no possible action, so I won't provide.\n\nBut the format says to provide for t1, t1+1, etc., so perhaps only turn 64.\n\nBut let's assume that at turn 64, I move L, and then at turn 65, I can move U to (4,2) if it becomes free, but it doesn't at that turn.\n\nPerhaps the food at (5,6) is on the body, and if I move, I can eat it later.\n\nBut for now, at turn 64, only choice.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head position or something.\n\nHead at (5,1), direction L.\n\nGrid: x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\n(5,1) left is (4,1), which is free.\n\nAfter move, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nThen at turn 65, from (4,1), I can only move if there is a free cell, but there isn't.\n\nUnless I move down, but (4,0) is wall.\n\nOr right, but not allowed and occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to the tail cell if it's adjacent, but at (4,1), the tail is at (2,2), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells are (3,1), (5,1), (4,2), (4,0).\n\nAll blocked.\n\nSo I think for the answer, I'll provide turn 64: L.\n\nThen for turn 65, since no move, I can't provide.\n\nBut perhaps in the context, I need to think about eating food to grow and change the tail position.\n\nBut at turn 64, no food to eat, so length same, tail moves away.\n\nAt turn 64, if I could eat food, but there is no food at (4,1), so no.\n\nFood at (2,4), etc., far away.\n\nSo I think it's inevitable.\n\nPerhaps at turn 64, moving left to (4,1) is safe for that turn, but next turn it's stuck.\n\nSo for the AI, it should avoid such paths, but here no choice.\n\nSo I'll go with L for turn 64.\n\nThen for turn 65, no action.\n\nBut since the format requires actions for multiple turns, perhaps I need to plan for when it is possible.\n\nMaybe I can move in a way to eat food quickly.\n\nBut at turn 64, no other move.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the direction constraint is only for the current turn, and I can choose to change direction.\n\nBut at turn 64, from (5,1), moving U to (5,2) is invalid because it's occupied, not because of direction.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nLet's look at the food life span: (2,4) with life span 2, so at turn 64, available, turn 65 available, then disappears.\n\nBut head is at (5,1), (2,4) is at distance, not reachable in one turn.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo no help.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to (4,1) and then at turn 65, if I could move, but I can't.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide only turn 64 action.\n\nBut let's see the initial state again.\n\n\"Snake Positions\": [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1,2)]\n\n\"Snake Head Direction\": L\n\nSo after moving left, positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), ..., up to (2,2), with (1,2) removed.\n\nThe segment at (4,2) is still there.\n\nAt (4,1), no move.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle at (3,1) is not a wall, but the description says \"internal obstacles: [(3,1)]\", and \"cells occupied by walls\", so it is a wall.\n\nSo I think for turn 64, action is L.\n\nThen for turn 65, no action.\n\nBut since the AI must provide actions, perhaps only for turn 64.\n\nMaybe in the next turns, if I had moved, but I can't.\n\nI'll start with turn 64: L.\n\nThen for turn 65, it dies, so no further actions.\n\nBut to think ahead, I need to consider if there is a way to avoid this.\n\nPerhaps at turn 64, I can move down, but (5,0) is wall, so no.\n\nOr up, occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to proceed.\n\nSo for the answer, turn 64: L\n\nThen no more.\n\nBut the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so perhaps I need to plan a path.\n\nBut in this case, it's not possible.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (4,1) and then at turn 65, the cell (4,2) might be free if the snake moves, but at the time, it's occupied.\n\nI think I should look for food to eat to survive longer.\n\nFor example, the food at (1,5) with life span 4, so available until turn 67.\n\nHead at (5,1), to reach (1,5), it's far, with many obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) closer, at (2,4), life span 2, so must eat by turn 65.\n\nAt turn 64, head at (5,1), (2,4) is at distance |5-2| + |1-4| = 3+3=6, not reachable in 2 turns.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\n(6,3) has food, but at (6,3), which is body, so I need to move the body away.\n\nBut head is at (5,1), far.\n\nSo no immediate help.\n\nI think for turn 64, only action is L.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nThen for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: L (left)\n}\n\nBut since it dies, no more turns.\n\nPerhaps the AI can choose to move in a way that risks, but here no choice.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 64, moving left to (4,1) is safe, and at turn 65, if I move up to (4,2), it might be allowed if (4,2) is the tail, but it's not; the tail is (2,2).\n\nUnless after the move at turn 64, the tail is at (2,2), and at turn 65, when I move, the tail moves to (3,2) or something, but at the time of move, the cell is occupied.\n\nThe collision is checked when the head moves to the cell; if that cell is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it collides.\n\nHere, (4,2) is occupied by a body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nI'll provide the action for turn 64 only.\n\nBut for the format, perhaps I need to write it as is.\n\nMaybe I misread the snake positions.\n\nLet's list the positions in a grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and (3,1).\n\nSnake at turn 64:\n\n- (5,1) head\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (1,2) tail\n\nSo (4,1) is empty.\n\nAfter move L to (4,1), head at (4,1), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) tail.\n\nAt (4,1), adjacent:\n\n- West: (3,1) wall\n\n- North: (4,2) occupied by body ( the (4,2) in the list)\n\n- South: (4,0) wall\n\n- East: (5,1) occupied by body\n\nAll blocked, no move possible at turn 65.\n\nSo for turn 64, action L.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 64)\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (5, 1), moving left (L).\n- **Snake Body**: The snake has 18 segments. After moving, the tail will be at (2, 2) if no food is eaten.\n- **Possible Moves at Turn 64**:\n  - **Up (U) to (5, 2)**: Occupied by body segment (index 13: (5,2)), so collision. Invalid.\n  - **Down (D) to (5, 0)**: Wall (y=0 border), so invalid.\n  - **Left (L) to (4, 1)**: Free cell (not wall, not occupied by body or tail). Valid and safe for this turn.\n  - **Right (R) to (6, 1)**: Occupied by body segment (index 1: (6,1)) and opposite to current direction (L), so invalid.\n  - **Only valid move is L to (4, 1)**.\n\n- **Consequence of Moving Left (L) at Turn 64**:\n  - Head moves to (4, 1), direction remains L.\n  - Snake body updates: New head at (4, 1), followed by (5, 1), then the remaining body segments. Tail (1, 2) is removed (no growth).\n  - At turn 65, head is at (4, 1) with direction L. Possible moves:\n    - Left (L) to (3, 1): Wall (internal obstacle), invalid.\n    - Up (U) to (4, 2): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision. Invalid.\n    - Down (D) to (4, 0): Wall (y=0 border), invalid.\n    - Right (R) to (5, 1): Occupied by body segment (not tail) and opposite to current direction (L), invalid.\n  - **No valid moves at turn 65, resulting in snake death**. Thus, moving L at turn 64 leads to immediate death on turn 65.\n\n- **Long-Term Survival Consideration**:\n  - Moving L at turn 64 is unavoidable but fatal on turn 65. No other moves are possible at turn 64.\n  - Food cannot be reached before death:\n    - Closest food at (2, 4) has Manhattan distance 6 from (5, 1) ( |5-2| + |1-4| = 3+3=6), and life span 2 (disappears after turn 65). Not reachable in time.\n    - Other food is farther or under body (e.g., (6, 3) under body), requiring multiple turns to access.\n  - No path to food or escape exists within 1-2 turns due to body and wall constraints.\n\n### Decision for Turn 64\n- **Turn 64 Action**: Must move L (left) to (4, 1), as it is the only valid move. This delays death by one turn but cannot be avoided.\n- **Turn 65 and Beyond**: No valid moves exist, so the snake dies at turn 65. No further actions can be planned.\n\n### Answer Format\nSince the snake dies at turn 65, only the action for turn 64 is provided.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: L (left)\n}",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,1), and direction is L (left). The body segments are listed: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. Let me plot this to visualize.\n\nStarting from head: (4,1) is head. Then (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), then left to (5,6), (4,6), then down to (4,5)? (4,5) is below (4,6)? y=5 is down if y increases up? No, in grid coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upward. Let's confirm:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — moving up, y increases\n\n- D: (x, y-1) — moving down, y decreases\n\n- L: (x-1, y) — left, x decreases\n\n- R: (x+1, y) — right, x increases\n\nAlso, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, and internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nNow snake positions: let's list all positions in order:\n\n1. Head: (4,1)\n\n2. (5,1)\n\n3. (6,1)\n\n4. (6,2)\n\n5. (6,3)\n\n6. (6,4)\n\n7. (6,5)\n\n8. (6,6)\n\n9. (5,6)\n\n10. (4,6)\n\n11. (4,5) — y=5, which is below y=6 if y increases up? (4,6) to (4,5): since (4,5) has lower y, it's down, so moving down from (4,6) to (4,5).\n\nThen:\n\n12. (4,4)\n\n13. (4,3)\n\n14. (5,3) — from (4,3) to (5,3) is right\n\n15. (5,2) — from (5,3) to (5,2) is down? y=2 < y=3, so down\n\n16. (4,2) — from (5,2) to (4,2) is left\n\n17. (3,2) — from (4,2) to (3,2) is left\n\n18. (2,2) — tail, from (3,2) to (2,2) is left\n\nSo the snake is long; 18 segments.\n\nHead direction is L, left, so last move was left to (4,1) from previous? Positions: head at (4,1), which came from (5,1), and since direction is L, it moved left to (4,1) from (5,1). Next possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R (opposite) because of no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,1), direction L.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,4) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (1,5) with value 1, life span 3? It says \" (2, 4, 1, 1) \" and \" (1, 5, 3, 1) \" — I think the format is (x, y, value, life_span) or (x, y, life_span, value)? Let's see the input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (2,4,1,1) - (1,5,3,1) - (6,3,6,1) - (5,6,9,1)\"\n\nIt says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the tuple, it might be (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? I think it's (x,y, value, life_span) because for (2,4,1,1), value=1, life_span=1; (1,5,3,1) value=3? But value should be +1 or -1 for food, but here it says \"value1\" which might be the reward, but in the core rules, positive food is +1, negative is -1, but here (1,5,3,1) has 3, which is not ±1. Inconsistency?\n\nLook back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for each, it's ( (x,y), value, life_span )\n\nIn the state: \" (2, 4, 1, 1) \" — this might be misformatted; it should be ( (2,4), 1, 1 ) meaning x=2,y=4, value=1, life_span=1\n\nSimilarly, (1,5,3,1) — (x=1,y=5), value=3, life_span=1? But value=3? That can't be right; core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1. Unless there are different values? But core rules don't mention that.\n\nCore rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\", so values should be ±1.\n\nBut here, (1,5,3,1) has value=3, which is odd. Perhaps it's a mistake, or maybe value is the reward, so +3? But core rules say +1 or -1. I think I should assume that the value is as given; perhaps in this case, food can have different values? But the rules didn't say that.\n\nCheck the input format: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and in state it's listed as (2,4,1,1) etc., so likely (x,y, value, life_span).\n\nFor (2,4,1,1): x=2,y=4, value=1, life_span=1\n\n(1,5,3,1): x=1,y=5, value=3, life_span=1\n\n(6,3,6,1): x=6,y=3, value=6, life_span=1\n\n(5,6,9,1): x=5,y=6, value=9, life_span=1\n\nBut core rules say food values are ±1, but here we have 1,3,6,9, all positive, so perhaps in this game, food can have different values? I should go with the state given; maybe it's a variant. But the core rules didn't specify, so I'll assume the values are as provided.\n\nAll values are positive here: 1,3,6,9, all >0, so all are positive food, no negative food in this state.\n\nLife spans: all have life_span=1? (2,4,1,1) life_span=1, (1,5,3,1) life_span=1, etc. But life_span=1 means it disappears after 1 turn, including current, so after this turn, if not eaten, it vanishes? Let's see.\n\nLife-span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food with life_span N, on the turn it appears, life_span=N, then next turn N-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nIn this state, turn 65, all food have life_span=1, so on turn 65, life_span=1, then after turn 65, it decreases to 0, so it disappears before turn 66? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t when food appears, life_span=N, at the start of turn t, before action.\n\nThen, after the snake moves on turn t, the countdown decreases, so after turn t, life_span becomes N-1.\n\nIf life_span reaches 0, the food disappears before the next turn.\n\nFor food with life_span=1: at turn t=65, life_span=1. After the snake's action on turn 65, life_span decreases to 0, so it disappears and is not available for turn 66.\n\nSo all food here have life_span=1, so they must be eaten on this turn (turn 65) or they disappear forever.\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nSuppose food spawns at turn t with life_span=N.\n\nAt turn t, life_span=N.\n\nSnake can eat it on turn t by moving to that cell.\n\nAfter snake's action on turn t, for all food, life_span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life_span becomes 0, food is removed.\n\nSo for life_span=1, if not eaten on turn t, it disappears after turn t.\n\nSimilarly, for life_span=k, it can be eaten on turns t to t+k-1, I think.\n\nBut here all have life_span=1, so only available on turn 65.\n\nIn the state, turn 65, food listed with life_span=1.\n\nSo if I don't eat any on turn 65, all food disappears, and I have no food to eat.\n\nBut there might be new food spawning later, but the state doesn't say anything about new food; I think food only comes as listed, and no new food is mentioned, so if I don't eat now, I might have no food for a while, which is bad for score.\n\nBut I need to think about survival first.\n\nAlso, one food is at (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied by the snake body! Position 5 is (6,3), which is a body segment.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nCurrently, (6,3) has food with value 6, but it's under the snake body, so I can't eat it directly; I need to move the body away first.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,4) value 1, (1,5) value 3, (5,6) value 9.\n\n(5,6) is also occupied? Snake positions: position 9 is (5,6), so (5,6) is occupied by snake body.\n\nFood at (5,6,9,1), but (5,6) is a body segment, so it's under snake, cannot be eaten directly.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3,6,1) is at (6,3), which is snake position 5.\n\nNow, (2,4) and (1,5) are not occupied, I think.\n\nList free cells.\n\nFirst, grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders and (3,1).\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nSo cells: for example, (0,0) to (0,7) wall, (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (0,0) to (7,0) wall, (0,7) to (7,7) wall, and (3,1) is also wall.\n\n(3,1) is internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell.\n\nNow snake occupies 18 cells: let's list them:\n\n(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nFood at:\n\n- (2,4): not in snake positions, and not wall, so free.\n\n- (1,5): not in snake or walls, free.\n\n- (6,3): in snake positions, occupied.\n\n- (5,6): in snake positions, occupied.\n\nSo only (2,4) and (1,5) are accessible, but with life_span=1, so only on this turn.\n\nBut (2,4) value 1, (1,5) value 3.\n\nNow, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: since direction L, I can move L, U, or D, not R (opposite).\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- L: to (3,1) — but (3,1) is wall (internal obstacle), so invalid.\n\n- U: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is snake position 16, which is a body segment. Is this a collision?\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nGeneral rule: when moving, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides and dies, except if it's the tail cell, because tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: head at (4,1), tail at (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (4,2), (4,2) is position 16, which is not the tail; tail is at (2,2). Positions: (4,2) is segment 16, and tail is segment 18 at (2,2), so (4,2) is body, not tail. So moving to (4,2) would collide with body, die.\n\nSimilarly, D: to (4,0) — but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nR: to (5,1) — but (5,1) is position 2, body segment, and not tail, so collision. Also, direction is L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo from (4,1), with direction L:\n\n- L to (3,1): wall, invalid\n\n- U to (4,2): body, collision\n\n- D to (4,0): wall, invalid\n\n- R to (5,1): body and reverse, invalid\n\nAll moves are invalid? That can't be right; I must have a valid move.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction L.\n\nAfter moving, the tail moves, so the cell that was tail might be free, but when I move the head, the body follows, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nBut for collision, when I move head to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body at that time, it collides, except if it's the tail cell.\n\nAt the moment of movement, the snake body is in its positions, and when head moves, if the new head position is a body cell, it collides unless it's the tail.\n\nIn this case, from (4,1) to (4,2): (4,2) is currently occupied by segment 16, which is not tail, so collision.\n\nBut after I move, the tail moves, so (4,2) will be vacated, but at the time of head move, it is occupied.\n\nI think the collision is checked before the tail moves.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, head goes to new cell, if that cell is wall or body (except tail), die. Then tail moves if no food eaten.\n\nBut in this case, since we might eat food, tail doesn't move if food eaten.\n\nBut for collision, it's based on the state before move.\n\nSo from (4,1), moving to (4,2): (4,2) is currently occupied by snake body, not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, other directions blocked.\n\nBut R to (5,1): (5,1) is position 2, body, not tail, and also reverse direction.\n\nD to (4,0) wall.\n\nL to (3,1) wall.\n\nSo no valid moves? That means snake is trapped and dies on this turn, but that can't be, or is it?\n\nPerhaps I misread the positions.\n\nSnake positions: let's list coordinates:\n\nHead: (4,1)\n\nThen: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nSo from head (4,1), the next segment is (5,1), so the head is at (4,1), which is connected to (5,1) at its right.\n\nDirection is L, so it came from (5,1) to (4,1), moving left.\n\nNow, adjacent cells:\n\n- Left: (3,1) — wall\n\n- Up: (4,2) — which is in positions, (4,2) is the 16th position? Positions: index 1: (4,1) head, index 2: (5,1), ..., let's index from 1 or 0.\n\nBetter to list with indices:\n\n1. (4,1) head\n\n2. (5,1)\n\n3. (6,1)\n\n4. (6,2)\n\n5. (6,3)\n\n6. (6,4)\n\n7. (6,5)\n\n8. (6,6)\n\n9. (5,6)\n\n10. (4,6)\n\n11. (4,5)\n\n12. (4,4)\n\n13. (4,3)\n\n14. (5,3)\n\n15. (5,2)\n\n16. (4,2)\n\n17. (3,2)\n\n18. (2,2) tail\n\nSo (4,2) is position 16, which is a body segment.\n\n(4,1) up would be (4,2), which is occupied.\n\nDown (4,0) wall.\n\nLeft (3,1) wall.\n\nRight (5,1) occupied by position 2.\n\nAll seem occupied or wall.\n\nBut (3,2) is position 17, and (2,2) tail.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move to (3,2)? But (3,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,2) up, (4,0) down, (3,1) left, (5,1) right. (3,2) is diagonal, not adjacent; only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo no, only U, D, L, R.\n\nSo from (4,1), all moves are invalid? That means the snake must collide and die on this turn.\n\nBut that seems odd for a game state.\n\nPerhaps the direction is wrong or something.\n\nAnother possibility: when moving to a cell that is the tail, it is allowed because tail moves.\n\nBut here, the tail is at (2,2), not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (4,1), tail at (2,2), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells are all blocked.\n\nBut let's check if any cell is free.\n\nFor example, (3,1) is wall.\n\n(4,2) is occupied.\n\n(4,0) wall.\n\n(5,1) occupied.\n\nWhat about (3,2)? Not adjacent to (4,1); (4,1) and (3,2) are not orthogonally adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nSo not a move option.\n\nSo indeed, from (4,1), no valid move; all directions lead to wall or body.\n\nBut the body at (4,2) is not the tail; tail is far away.\n\nSo on this turn, whatever I do, I die.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; perhaps I misread the grid or positions.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, so columns 0 to 7, rows 0 to 7.\n\n(4,1) is x=4,y=1.\n\nU: (4,2) y=2\n\nD: (4,0) y=0 wall\n\nL: (3,1) x=3,y=1, which is internal obstacle, wall\n\nR: (5,1) x=5,y=1, occupied by snake body.\n\nAll invalid.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to the tail cell if it is adjacent, but here tail is at (2,2), not adjacent.\n\nOr maybe the head is not at (4,1) for some reason.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (5,1), etc.\n\nAnother thought: when the snake moves, the body follows, so the cell that was occupied might be free, but for the head move, the position must be empty or tail.\n\nBut (4,2) is currently occupied, so it's not free.\n\nUnless the tail is moving, but at the time of decision, the state is as given.\n\nI think the snake is trapped and must die on this turn.\n\nBut that seems strange for the problem.\n\nPerhaps I have a mistake in the positions.\n\nList all occupied cells:\n\nFrom positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nSo cells: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nNow, (4,2) is occupied, so head cannot move there.\n\nFood at (2,4), (1,5), both free, but not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (4,1), (2,4) is at x=2,y=4, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) not adjacent.\n\nSo no way to eat food directly.\n\nBut for movement, I need to move the head to a free cell.\n\nBut from (4,1), no adjacent free cell or tail cell.\n\nThe only possible move would be to the tail if it were adjacent, but it's not.\n\nFor example, if tail were at (4,2), but it's at (2,2).\n\nSo I think the snake has no valid move and will die.\n\nBut perhaps the direction allows reverse, but no, no instant reverse, and even if I could, (5,1) is occupied.\n\n(5,1) is the second segment, so if I move right to (5,1), it would collide with body.\n\nSo I think it's game over.\n\nBut let's assume that for the sake of the problem, there must be a way, or perhaps I missed a cell.\n\nWhat about (3,2)? (3,2) is position 17, occupied.\n\n(4,1) to (3,2) is not orthogonal.\n\nOr (5,2)? (5,2) is position 15, occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle (3,1) is not a wall for movement, but it says \"cells occupied by walls\", and (3,1) is listed as internal obstacle, so it is a wall.\n\nSo I think the snake is trapped.\n\nBut this can't be; perhaps the head direction is wrong.\n\nHead direction is L, but positions show head at (4,1) with (5,1) next, so it came from right, so direction L is correct.\n\nMaybe on this turn, I can move in a way that the tail is left, but tail is not adjacent.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is at (2,2), and if I move in a direction that makes the tail move, but for the head move, the cell must be free at that time.\n\nI think I have to accept that there is no valid move, so the snake dies.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, since all moves are invalid, I have to choose one, but it will die.\n\nBut let's look at the food life span; all life_span=1, so if I don't eat, they disappear.\n\nBut I can't eat anyway.\n\nPerhaps I can move to a cell that will be free after tail moves, but no, collision is checked before move.\n\nI think there's a problem with the state.\n\nPerhaps the food at (6,3) and (5,6) are under body, so I need to move to free them.\n\nBut for this turn, I need to move the head to a safe cell, but there is none.\n\nLet's list all adjacent cells to head:\n\n- North: (4,2) - occupied by snake (position 16)\n\n- South: (4,0) - wall\n\n- West: (3,1) - wall (internal obstacle)\n\n- East: (5,1) - occupied by snake (position 2)\n\nAll blocked.\n\nSo no, the snake cannot move without dying.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to the tail cell if it is adjacent, but here it's not.\n\nOr in some rules, moving to the cell where the tail was is allowed, but only if it's the current tail cell.\n\nHere, tail is far.\n\nI think I have to proceed with the assumption that the snake must move, and it will die, but that doesn't make sense for the problem.\n\nMaybe I misread the positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2,2)]\n\nSo (4,2) is in the list, at position 16.\n\nPosition 16 is (4,2), which is directly above (4,1).\n\nSo moving up to (4,2) would collide.\n\nUnless the snake is moving in a way that the tail is at (4,2), but it's not; tail is (2,2).\n\nThe position before tail is (3,2), then (2,2).\n\nSo (4,2) is not tail.\n\nI think I have to accept that for this turn, there is no safe move, so the snake will die on any action.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 65, I can choose U, but it will die.\n\nBut then no future turns.\n\nBut the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, so there must be a way.\n\nAnother possibility: the internal obstacle (3,1) might not be a wall, but it says \"cells occupied by walls\" and includes it, so it is a wall.\n\nOr perhaps y-coordinates: if y=0 is bottom, then U is increasing y, so (4,1) to (4,2) is up.\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied.\n\nLet's count the segments: 18 positions.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (3,2), but it's not adjacent.\n\nI think I need to look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the direction constraint is only for the next move, but the move itself can be to an invalid cell, but the rules say deadly collisions, so if I move to wall or body, I die.\n\nSo for turn 65, whatever I do, I die.\n\nBut let's assume that I move U to (4,2), and it collides, game over.\n\nThen for the answer, I can only provide turn 65 action, but it dies.\n\nBut that seems pointless.\n\nPerhaps the food at (6,3) is under body, and I can eat it later, but for now, I need to survive this turn.\n\nBut I can't move.\n\nUnless there is a cell I missed.\n\nWhat about (4,1) to (3,1)? Wall.\n\nOr (5,1) occupied.\n\nOr (4,2) occupied.\n\nPerhaps (3,2) is adjacent? (4,1) and (3,2): x difference 1, y difference 1, not orthogonal; only if x or y same and adjacent.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the snake is trapped.\n\nBut for the sake of proceeding, let's assume that moving U to (4,2) is possible because the tail is moving or something, but according to rules, it should collide.\n\nPerhaps in this game, when moving, the head moves first, and if it moves to the tail cell, it's ok, but here tail is not at (4,2).\n\nPosition 16 is (4,2), which is body, not tail.\n\nSo I think it's collision.\n\nI recall the special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision with new tail.\n\nBut here, head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nTail is at (2,2), head at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nSo not relevant.\n\nI think I have to move to a direction and die.\n\nBut let's check the food life span; all life_span=1, so even if I could move, I might not eat.\n\nBut I can't move.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, I can choose not to move, but the rules say I must choose a direction to move one cell.\n\nSo I must choose U, D, L, R.\n\nAll lead to death.\n\nSo for turn 65, I can choose U, but die.\n\nThen the game ends.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but if I die, no future turns.\n\nSo perhaps only turn 65 action.\n\nBut that seems against the spirit.\n\nPerhaps I misread the positions.\n\nLet's list the positions again: \"Snake Positions\": [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2,2)]\n\nNow, (4,2) is the 16th position, and it's at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nBut when the snake moves, if I move U to (4,2), it would be head to (4,2), but (4,2) is already occupied, so collision.\n\nUnless the snake is so long that (4,2) is not the immediate body, but it is part of the body.\n\nIn standard snake, moving into your own body except tail is death.\n\nHere, (4,2) is not the tail; the tail is at (2,2).\n\nSo I think it's death.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (4,2) if it is the tail in the next state, but at the time of move, it is occupied.\n\nI think I should proceed with moving U and dying, but that can't be right.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the internal obstacle at (3,1) is not a wall, but it is listed as internal obstacle, so it is a wall.\n\nOr maybe the border walls are only at the edges, but (4,0) is y=0, which is border, wall.\n\nI think I have to accept that and move on.\n\nFor turn 65, I choose U, but I die, so no further actions.\n\nBut then for the answer, I can only provide turn 65.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" etc., so I can do that.\n\nBut let's assume that by moving U, I eat the food or something, but (4,2) has no food; food is at (2,4) etc.\n\nNo food at (4,2).\n\nSo I think for turn 65, I must choose a move, and it will die.\n\nSo I'll choose U for example.\n\nThen the game ends.\n\nBut for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps there's a mistake.\n\nLet's look at the head direction: \"Snake Head Direction\": L\n\nBut with positions, head at (4,1), previous at (5,1), so L is correct.\n\nPerhaps on this turn, I can move in a way that the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied, so collision before the body moves.\n\nI think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps the grid has more cells; but x=0 to 7, so 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7).\n\n(4,1) is one cell, surrounded.\n\nAnother cell: (3,1) is wall, (5,1) occupied, (4,2) occupied, (4,0) wall.\n\nNo.\n\nI think I have to go with it.\n\nSo for turn 65, I choose U, move to (4,2), collide with body, die.\n\nGame over.\n\nBut then for the answer, I can only provide turn 65 action.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so it must be possible.\n\nPerhaps the food at (6,3) is under body, and I can plan to eat it later, but for now, I need to move to a safe cell, but there is none.\n\nLet's ignore the collision for a moment and see where I can go.\n\nFrom (4,1), if I could move U to (4,2), then head at (4,2), but (4,2) was position 16, so collision.\n\nBut after moving, the tail moves to (3,2) or something.\n\nBut at the time of move, the cell is occupied.\n\nI think in most snake games, it is collision.\n\nPerhaps in this rule, since the tail will move, it is allowed if it is the tail cell, but here it's not.\n\nI give up.\n\nLet's assume that for this turn, I can move U, and it is allowed because the snake can move to the cell that will be vacated, but according to the rules, it's not.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo only tail cell is allowed, not other body cells.\n\nHere, (4,2) is not the tail cell; tail is (2,2).\n\nSo not allowed.\n\nSo I think the snake is trapped.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide turn 65: U, and that's it.\n\nBut let's see the food: all life_span=1, so if I don't eat, they disappear.\n\nBut I can't eat.\n\nFood at (2,4) and (1,5) are free, but not reachable this turn.\n\n(6,3) and (5,6) under body.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for future turns, but I die now.\n\nI think I have to start with turn 65 action as U, but it dies.\n\nThen for the box, only one line.\n\nBut let's assume that by moving U, I don't die for some reason, but according to rules, I do.\n\nPerhaps the position (4,2) is the tail in the next moment, but no.\n\nAnother idea: the snake positions are listed with head first, but perhaps the direction is wrong.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction L, so last move was from (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nIf I move R back to (5,1), but it is occupied, and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I should look for a way to free the body.\n\nBut for this turn, no.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle at (3,1) is not a wall for all, but it is.\n\nI think I must proceed.\n\nSo for turn 65, I choose to move U to (4,2), but it collides, die.\n\nSo action: U\n\nThen no future turns.\n\nBut for the format, I can write only that.\n\nBut let's see the answer format: \"Turn 65: action on turn 65\" etc.\n\nSo for turn 65, I can say U.\n\nThen the snake dies, so no more.\n\nBut perhaps in the context, I need to provide a sequence if possible.\n\nMaybe I misread the walls.\n\n\"Cells occupied by walls: - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 1)]\"\n\nSo walls are all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and also (3,1).\n\nSo (3,1) is wall.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps y=0 is not wall, but it says y=0 is border, so wall.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nSo for turn 65, I move U, die.\n\nBut to make it interesting, perhaps the snake can move to (3,2) if it were possible, but not.\n\nOr perhaps the head can move diagonally, but no, only orthogonal.\n\nI think I'll go with U for turn 65.\n\nThen for future turns, nothing.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so for this state, it's not possible.\n\nPerhaps the life span of food: all life_span=1, but for (6,3,6,1), it is under body, so if I move the body away, I can eat it later, but life_span=1, so after this turn, it disappears, so I can't eat it later.\n\nSimilarly for all food.\n\nSo only this turn matters, but I can't eat any.\n\nSo no score gain.\n\nBut I die anyway.\n\nSo perhaps the game is over.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut let's assume that moving U is invalid, but I have to choose something.\n\nSo I choose U.\n\nThen in the box.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about if there is a way.\n\nPerhaps the food at (5,6) or (6,3) can be eaten if I move the head to a position that frees it, but for now, I need to survive.\n\nBut I can't move.\n\nAnother thought: the cell (4,2) might have food, but no, food is at (2,4), (1,5), (6,3), (5,6), so (4,2) has no food.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nI'll proceed with the move.\n\nSo for turn 65, action: U\n\nThen the snake dies.\n\nSo no further actions.\n\nFor the box, only one line.\n\nBut the format allows multiple, but here only one.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, since all food have life_span=1, and I can't eat, they disappear, and I need to move to survive, but I can't.\n\nI think I have to submit.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U\n}\n\nBut that seems incomplete.\n\nPerhaps the head can move D to (4,0), but wall, die.\n\nSame thing.\n\nOr L to (3,1), wall, die.\n\nR to (5,1), body, die.\n\nSo all choices die, so I choose one, say U.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 65)\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n- 8x8 grid (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- Walls: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are borders. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n- Snake positions (18 segments): Head at (4,1), tail at (2,2). Full body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)].\n- Snake head direction: Left (L), so last move was from (5,1) to (4,1).\n- Food:\n  - (2,4): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 65 if not eaten).\n  - (1,5): Value +3, life span 1 (disappears after turn 65 if not eaten).\n  - (6,3): Value +6, life span 1 (disappears after turn 65; currently under snake body at position 5).\n  - (5,6): Value +9, life span 1 (disappears after turn 65; currently under snake body at position 9).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- Head at (4,1) with direction L. Possible moves:\n  - Left (L) to (3,1): Wall (internal obstacle), invalid.\n  - Up (U) to (4,2): Occupied by snake body (position 16, not tail), collision risk.\n  - Down (D) to (4,0): Wall (y=0 border), invalid.\n  - Right (R) to (5,1): Occupied by snake body (position 2, not tail) and reverse move not allowed (current direction L), invalid.\n- All adjacent cells are blocked, meaning any move results in death on turn 65. This is a terminal state with no valid actions for survival.\n- Food: All food has life span 1, so they disappear after turn 65 regardless of actions. No food can be eaten due to immediate death.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 65:**\n- The snake has no safe move. Any action leads to collision or wall impact, ending the game.\n- Since a move must be chosen, \"U\" (up) is selected arbitrarily, but it results in death. No further turns are possible.\n\n**5+ Turn Lookahead (Hypothetical, If Survival Were Possible):**\n- If the snake could survive turn 65, the priority would be to avoid immediate death and access food. However, with all food disappearing after turn 65 and no new food specified, long-term scoring would rely on future food spawns.\n- Survival strategy would involve:\n  - Freeing food under the body (e.g., (6,3) or (5,6)) by moving the snake to vacate those cells.\n  - Navigating toward open areas like the top-left (near (1,5) or (2,4)) or bottom-right.\n  - Avoiding tail collisions, especially with the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule if head and tail become adjacent.\n- Example sequence (not applicable here):\n  - Turn 65: Move to free a path (e.g., if possible, move U to access open cells).\n  - Turn 66: Target high-value food or safe spaces.\n  - But in this state, death is unavoidable on turn 65.\n\n### Action Sequence\nGiven the state, only one action is possible before game over:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U\n}",
