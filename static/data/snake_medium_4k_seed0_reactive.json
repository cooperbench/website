        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**: \n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**: \n   - Current position: Only the head at (3,3).\n   - Direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=10.\n   - (2,2): value=1, life_span=10.\n   - (4,3): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- The snake has no body segments other than the head, so no risk of self-collision.\n- The snake's current direction is Left (L), meaning it's moving towards decreasing x-coordinate.\n- Possible moves: U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right). But since the snake is moving Left, it cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) in the next move.\n\n### Available Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n1. **Continue Left (L)**: New position would be (2,3).\n   - Check for walls: \n     - x=2 is not a border wall (borders are x=0,7).\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Check for food: \n     - (2,2) is food, but not at (2,3).\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: New position would be (3,4).\n   - Check walls: \n     - y=4 is not a border (y=0,7 are borders).\n     - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are obstacles, but (3,4) is not listed.\n   - Check food: \n     - No food at (3,4).\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: New position would be (3,2).\n   - Check walls: \n     - y=2 is not a border.\n     - No internal obstacles at (3,2).\n   - Check food: \n     - No food at (3,2).\n   - Safe move.\n\n4. **Turn Right (R)**: Not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (L).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's consider the food positions:\n1. **(3,5)**: Up from the current position (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5).\n   - Two moves away.\n2. **(2,2)**: Left and Down from (3,3) → (2,3) → (2,2).\n   - Two moves away.\n3. **(4,3)**: Right from (3,3), but we cannot move Right immediately.\n\n### Immediate Food Access\n\nLooking at the immediate adjacent cells:\n- **(4,3)**: Right, but cannot move Right.\n- **(2,3)**: Left, no food.\n- **(3,4)**: Up, no food.\n- **(3,2)**: Down, no food.\n\nNone of the immediate adjacent cells have food, so the decision should be based on which move gets us closer to food in the fewest steps.\n\n### Path to Food\n\n1. **Path to (3,5)**:\n   - Move U to (3,4), then U to (3,5).\n   - Total steps: 2.\n\n2. **Path to (2,2)**:\n   - Move L to (2,3), then D to (2,2).\n   - Total steps: 2.\n\nBoth foods are equally distant. Let's consider the safety of the paths:\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,4) is safe.\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,3) is also safe.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nAfter the first move:\n1. If we choose U to (3,4):\n   - Next move would be U to (3,5) to get the food.\n   - But we need to ensure that after eating, the snake's length increases, and the tail doesn't cause a collision.\n   - Currently, the snake has only a head, so no tail collision risk.\n\n2. If we choose L to (2,3):\n   - Next move would be D to (2,2) to get the food.\n   - Again, no tail collision risk.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nSince both paths are equally good, we can choose either. However, the snake is currently moving Left, and continuing in the same direction might be more straightforward unless there's a reason to change.\n\nBut since the food at (2,2) is diagonally left-down, and the snake is already moving left, it might be more efficient to continue left first.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Benefits\n\nLooking at the immediate adjacent cells:\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,3) doesn't get food immediately but sets up for (2,2).\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,4) doesn't get food immediately but sets up for (3,5).\n\nBoth options are similar, but perhaps moving Left is more consistent with the current direction.\n\n### Considering Obstacles\n\nLooking at the internal obstacles:\n- (4,3) is not an obstacle, but we can't move Right.\n- (2,4) is an obstacle, but moving Left to (2,3) is safe.\n- (3,4) is safe.\n\nNo immediate obstacles affect the decision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both options are equally valid, I'll choose to continue Left to maintain the current direction and set up for the food at (2,2).\n\n### Verification\n\n- Current position: (3,3), direction L.\n- Move L to (2,3).\n- Next move: D to (2,2) to eat the food.\n\nThis seems safe and efficient.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to continue moving Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Not safe.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (2, 2)\n   - Check for walls: y=0 is the lower wall, but (2, 2) is safe.\n   - Check for food: There's a food at (2, 2) with value=1.\n   - Check for tail reward danger: The snake has no tail, so no danger.\n   - **Safe and Rewarding**: Can eat the food, gain +1 score, and increase length.\n\n### Verifying Other Options\n\n- **Right (R)**: Not allowed due to no instant reverse rule.\n- **Other Considerations**: \n  - The food at (2,2) is positive and has a long life span (9 turns).\n  - The other foods are not reachable in one move.\n\n### Decision Making\n\n- **Option 1 (L)**: Safe but no reward.\n- **Option 2 (U)**: Unsafe.\n- **Option 3 (D)**: Safe and rewarding.\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\n- **Forgetting Obstacles**: Initially, I thought moving up was safe until I checked the internal obstacles.\n- **No Tail Consideration**: Since the snake has no body, tail collision isn't a concern here, but it's good to verify.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to (2, 2) to eat the positive food there.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn \\( t_0 = 2 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(2,2), (2,3)].\n     - Head is at (2,2).\n     - Next segment (tail) is at (2,3).\n   - Current head direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward to reach (2,2) from (2,3).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=8.\n   - (4,3): value=1, life_span=8.\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=9.\n   All foods are positive (+1 reward, +1 length).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2) and direction D, the possible moves are U, D, L, R. However, we cannot reverse direction instantly, so:\n\n- Current direction: D.\n- Opposite direction: U (since D is down, U is up).\n- Therefore, cannot move U next. Allowed moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D):\n   - New head position: (2,1) (since D is (x,y-1)).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,1) is not in the internal obstacles list. Also, y=1 is not a border wall (border is y=0).\n     - Body: Snake body is at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,1) is not part of the body.\n   - Safe to move D.\n   - Food at (2,1)? No food listed there.\n   - So, move D is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n   - New head position: (1,2) (L is (x-1,y)).\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: (1,2) is not in internal obstacles. x=1 is not a border (borders are x=0,7).\n     - Body: (1,2) is not in [(2,3), (2,2)].\n   - Safe to move L.\n   - Food at (1,2)? No.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n   - New head position: (3,2) (R is (x+1,y)).\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,2) is not in internal obstacles. x=3 is not a border.\n     - Body: (3,2) is not in snake body.\n   - Safe to move R.\n   - Food at (3,2)? No.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, the foods are at:\n- (3,5): Far from current head (2,2). Distance is |3-2| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n- (4,3): Distance |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n- (6,4): Distance |6-2| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nClosest is (4,3) with distance 3. How to reach it?\n\nFrom (2,2), to reach (4,3):\n- Need to move right twice and up once, or up once and right twice, etc.\nBut immediate moves can only be one step.\n\nCurrent allowed moves: D, L, R.\n\nMoving R to (3,2) is towards (4,3) (x increases).\nThen next could move R to (4,2), then U to (4,3).\n\nAlternatively, moving D to (2,1) is away from food.\n\nMoving L to (1,2) is away from food.\n\nSo, R seems the best to start moving towards (4,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to (2,2) that we can eat immediately?\nAdjacent cells to (2,2):\n- U: (2,3) - snake body (tail). There's no food here.\n- D: (2,1) - no food.\n- L: (1,2) - no food.\n- R: (3,2) - no food.\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so no risk of tail reward danger (where head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- All possible moves (D, L, R) are safe.\n- No immediate food to eat.\n- Moving R starts heading towards the closest food at (4,3).\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 3\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake can't go outside these bounds.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are additional walls inside the grid that the snake must avoid.\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head: (3, 2)\n   - Body: [(3,2), (2,2)] (so the snake is 2 segments long)\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R). This means the last move was to the right, so the previous head was at (2,2) and moved right to (3,2).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (4,3): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,2)\n- New head position: (4,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - x=7 is a border wall, but (4,2) is not at x=7.\n    - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is at y=4, not y=2. Other obstacles don't interfere.\n    - So, no wall collision.\n  - **Body collision**: \n    - Current body segments: (3,2), (2,2)\n    - Moving to (4,2): does (4,2) overlap with body? No.\n    - After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new body will be [(4,2), (3,2)], and the tail at (2,2) disappears.\n    - No collision.\n- **Food**: \n  - Is there food at (4,2)? Checking the food positions: (3,5), (4,3), (6,4). No food at (4,2).\n  - So, no food eaten, length remains the same.\n- **Safety**: \n  - Next turn, if we're at (4,2), possible moves would be U, D, R (can't go left back to (3,2) unless we didn't just come from left, but we did, so no instant reverse).\n  - Seems safe for now.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,3)\n- New head position: (3,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - y=7 is border, (3,3) is fine.\n    - Internal obstacles: (3,3) is not listed as a wall.\n    - No wall collision.\n  - **Body collision**: \n    - Does (3,3) overlap with body? Current body: (3,2), (2,2). No.\n    - New body: [(3,3), (3,2)], tail (2,2) disappears.\n    - No collision.\n- **Food**: \n  - Is there food at (3,3)? No, food is at (3,5), (4,3), (6,4).\n  - No food eaten.\n- **Safety**: \n  - Next turn, from (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L (can't go down back to (3,2) if we just came from down, but we're coming from (3,2), so moving up to (3,3), so next move can't be down.\n  - Seems safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,1)\n- New head position: (3,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - y=0 is border, (3,1) is above y=0.\n    - Internal obstacles: none at (3,1).\n    - No wall collision.\n  - **Body collision**: \n    - Does (3,1) overlap with body? (3,2), (2,2). No.\n    - New body: [(3,1), (3,2)], tail (2,2) disappears.\n    - No collision.\n- **Food**: \n  - Is there food at (3,1)? No.\n  - No food eaten.\n- **Safety**: \n  - Next turn, from (3,1), possible moves: U (back to (3,2)), D, L, R. Can't go up back to (3,2) if we just came from up, but we're coming from (3,2) down to (3,1), so next move can't be up.\n  - Seems safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any of these moves can lead us toward food in the future, since currently, none of the immediate moves land on food.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n1. (3,5): Currently at (3,2), so need to go up by 3. Possible path: U, U, U.\n   - But need to avoid obstacles. (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are walls at y=4.\n   - From (3,2), U to (3,3), then U to (3,4), but (3,4) is not a wall, then U to (3,5).\n   - So path is possible: U, U, U.\n2. (4,3): From (3,2), R to (4,2), then U to (4,3).\n   - (4,3) is food, so this is a 2-move sequence: R, U.\n3. (6,4): From (3,2), R to (4,2), R to (5,2), U to (5,3), R to (6,3) but (6,3) is a wall, so can't go there.\n   - Alternative: R to (4,2), U to (4,3), R to (5,3), U to (5,4), R to (6,4).\n   - Longer path, but possible.\n\nBetween (3,5) and (4,3), (4,3) is closer (2 moves vs. 3 moves). (6,4) is even further.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that moving Right (R) to (4,2) sets us up to then move Up (U) to (4,3) to eat the food next turn, this seems like the most direct path to scoring.\n\nAlternative is moving Up (U) now towards (3,5), but that's a longer path, and we might find other food or risks along the way.\n\nMoving Down (D) doesn't seem beneficial as it doesn't lead directly towards any food.\n\n**Potential Risk Check**:\n- After moving R to (4,2), next move is U to (4,3) to eat food.\n  - Eating at (4,3): \n    - Snake grows by 1, so new body will be [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)].\n    - Need to ensure that after eating, the next move doesn't cause a collision.\n    - After eating at (4,3), possible moves from there: U to (4,4), but (4,4) is a wall, so can't.\n    - D to (4,2): but (4,2) is now part of the body (second segment), so collision.\n    - L to (3,3): possible.\n    - R to (5,3): possible.\n    - So after eating, we'd have to choose L or R to avoid collision.\n    - This seems manageable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate move is **Right (R)**, positioning the snake at (4,2), setting up to move Up to (4,3) next turn to eat the food there.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 4. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,2), body at (3,2). So the snake is 2 units long.\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=6.\n   - (4,3): value=1, life_span=6.\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,2) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,1)\n- **Left (L)**: (3,2) — but this is the current body position, and moving left would reverse the direction (from R to L), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Right (R)**: (5,2)\n\nSo, allowed moves are U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check for walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (3,2), so no collision.\n   - Check for food: (4,3) is a food position with value +1.\n     - Eating this food would increase length to 3.\n     - New body would be: head at (4,3), then (4,2), then (3,2).\n     - Next move from (4,3): need to ensure no collision with new tail at (3,2).\n     - Currently, tail is at (3,2), and after eating, new tail would be at (3,2) (since the old tail moves forward to where the body was).\n     - Wait, no: when you eat, the tail grows, so the tail doesn't move. So the snake would be [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)].\n     - Then next move from (4,3), the tail is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (4,3) (adjacent would be (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4)), so no immediate danger.\n   - Seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (4,1)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: body is at (3,2), no collision.\n   - Check food: no food at (4,1).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5,2)**:\n   - Check walls: (5,2) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: body is at (3,2), no collision.\n   - Check food: no food at (5,2).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Up (U)**: Eats positive food, increases length, seems safe.\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, no benefit.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, no benefit.\n\nBest immediate action is to move Up to eat the food at (4,3).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules:\n- \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Currently, tail is at (3,2). Adjacent cells to tail are:\n  - (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2).\n- Head is at (4,2), which is adjacent to tail at (3,2).\n- But the food is at (4,3), not on the tail. So this rule doesn't apply here because we're not eating food from the tail's position.\n\n### Verifying Other Food\n\nOther food positions:\n- (3,5): Far away, not reachable immediately.\n- (6,4): Also not immediately reachable.\n- (6,6): Even farther.\n\nNo other food is immediately accessible, so focusing on (4,3) is optimal.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Eating\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), next moves could be:\n- From (4,3), possible directions: U, D, L, R (but cannot reverse, so if we came from (4,2), cannot go D to (4,2)).\n   - U: (4,4) — check walls: (4,4) is an internal obstacle, so can't go there.\n   - D: (4,2) — but came from there, so reverse is not allowed.\n   - L: (3,3) — possible.\n   - R: (5,3) — possible.\nSo next moves would be L or R, but that's for future planning; current move is safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the positive food at (4,3), increasing the snake's length safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Right (R) - (5, 3):**\n- Check walls: (5,3) is not a wall.

Possible moves: L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\n**Food at:**\n- (3,5): Not adjacent to current head or possible moves.\n- (6,4): Not adjacent.\n- (6,6): Not adjacent.\n\nNo immediate food to eat in the next move, so the primary goal is to avoid collisions and position for future food.\n\n### Evaluating L vs. R\n\n**Left (L) to (3,3):**\n- Next possible moves from (3,3):\n  - U: (3,4) - check walls: (3,4) is not a wall or obstacle.\n  - D: (3,2) - body is at (3,2), but the tail is at (3,2). Since the tail will move forward (from (3,2) to where?), original tail is at (3,2), next is (4,2) moves to (4,3) (old head position), so (3,2) is vacated. Wait, no: snake is [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]. After moving head to (3,3), body becomes [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)], tail was (3,2) which is now gone. So moving D to (3,2) is safe because tail is moving away.\n  - L: (2,3) - check walls: no walls at (2,3).\n  \n**Right (R) to (5,3):**\n- Next possible moves from (5,3):\n  - U: (5,4) - check walls: (5,6) is a wall, but (5,4) is not.\n  - D: (5,2) - not a wall, not body (body would be at (4,3), (4,2)).\n  - R: (6,3) - internal obstacle, cannot move here.\n\nBetween L and R, both seem safe, but let's see future positioning.\n\nFrom (3,3), can go towards (3,5) food in future moves.\nFrom (5,3), can go towards (6,4) food in future moves.\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, current head y=3, so need to go up twice.\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, from (5,3) need to go R then U.\n\nBoth foods are equally distant in terms of steps, but (6,4) has a shorter life span (6 vs. 5 for (3,5)), but both are long enough that we don't need to prioritize based on that.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nNo food is under the tail currently. Tail is at (3,2), no food there.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth L and R are safe. Choosing based on future food access:\n\n- Moving L to (3,3) allows potential path to (3,5).\n- Moving R to (5,3) allows potential path to (6,4).\n\nBoth are similar, but moving left might be slightly better because from (3,3), can go up to (3,4), then (3,5) to eat the food at (3,5).\n\nMoving right to (5,3), then up to (5,4), then right to (6,4) also works, but involves moving towards the edge where there's an obstacle at (6,3).\n\nLeft seems slightly safer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 6\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7 (left and right borders), y=0, y=7 (bottom and top borders).\n- Internal obstacles (walls inside the grid): (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions: Head at (3,3), then body at (4,3), and tail at (4,2).\n- Current direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left to reach (3,3) from (4,3).\n\n**Food:**\n1. (3,5): value = 4, life_span = 1\n2. (6,4): value = 5, life_span = 1\n3. (6,6): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid to better understand the positions.\n\n- Grid size: Since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, it's an 8x8 grid (0-indexed).\n  \nCurrent snake:\n- Head: (3,3)\n- Body: (4,3)\n- Tail: (4,2)\n\nFood:\n- (3,5): top of the head\n- (6,4): far right, middle\n- (6,6): top-right corner\n\nWalls:\n- Internal obstacles are scattered; we'll note their positions when moving.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move (no instant reverse rule).\n\nSo, possible moves from current direction L are: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L):** (x-1,y) → (2,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: Is (2,3) a wall? Internal walls are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,3) is not listed.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (4,3) and (4,2). (2,3) is not part of the body.\n     - Border: x=0 is a wall. (2,3) is x=2, not x=0, so safe.\n   - Food at (2,3)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Up (U):** (x,y+1) → (3,4)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,4) is not in internal walls.\n     - Body: Snake is at (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). (3,4) is not part of the body.\n     - Border: y=7 is top, (3,4) is y=4, safe.\n   - Food at (3,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n3. **Down (D):** (x,y-1) → (3,2)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,2) is not in internal walls.\n     - Body: Snake tail is at (4,2). (3,2) is not part of the body.\n     - Border: y=0 is bottom, (3,2) is y=2, safe.\n   - Food at (3,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable in one move:\n\n1. (3,5): value=4, life=1\n   - Current position: (3,3)\n   - To reach (3,5) from (3,3), need to move Up twice: first to (3,4), then to (3,5).\n   - But life_span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n   - So, cannot reach it this turn; it will disappear after this turn.\n\n2. (6,4): value=5, life=1\n   - From (3,3) to (6,4):\n     - Need to move Right three times and Up once, or some combination, but cannot do in one move.\n   - Life_span=1, so disappears after this turn; cannot reach.\n\n3. (6,6): value=8, life=1\n   - From (3,3) to (6,6):\n     - Need to move Right three times and Up three times; cannot do in one move.\n   - Life_span=1, disappears after this turn; cannot reach.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and if the tail cell has positive food:\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Head is at (3,3).\n- Adjacent cells to head: (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3).\n- Tail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to head (distance is sqrt((4-3)^2 + (2-3)^2) = sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2), not 1).\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible moves (U, D, L), none lead to food this turn (all food will disappear after this turn due to life_span=1). So, we should choose the safest move that keeps options open for future turns.\n\n- Left (L) to (2,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,3): U, D, L (since moving L now, can't go R next).\n- Up (U) to (3,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,4): U, D, R (since moved U now, can't go D next).\n- Down (D) to (3,2):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,2): U, D, R (since moved D now, can't go U next).\n\nLooking at the grid, moving Left seems safe and doesn't box us in immediately. Moving Up or Down also safe, but Left might position us better for future moves towards the center or other areas where food might spawn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs any move leading to immediate death next turn?\n\n- Left to (2,3):\n  - Next turn, body will be at (3,3), (4,3), tail at (4,2) moves to (4,3)? Wait, how does body move?\n  - After moving head to (2,3), body segments follow:\n    - Old head (3,3) becomes first body segment.\n    - Old first body (4,3) becomes second body segment.\n    - Old tail (4,2) moves to where first body was, so (4,3).\n    - So new body: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)].\n  - Next move from (2,3), possible directions: U, D, L.\n    - U to (2,4):\n      - Check (2,4): internal wall is (2,4), so collision. Can't go U next.\n    - D to (2,2):\n      - Safe.\n    - L to (1,3):\n      - Safe.\n  - So moving L now restricts next move's U (but U would hit wall anyway).\n\n- Up to (3,4):\n  - New body: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)].\n  - Next moves from (3,4): U, D, R (can't go D).\n    - U to (3,5): but (3,5) is food that disappears this turn, so next turn it's gone. Safe.\n    - R to (4,4): internal wall at (4,4), so collision. Can't go R.\n    - So only U is safe next if we go U now.\n\n- Down to (3,2):\n  - New body: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3)].\n  - Next moves from (3,2): U, D, R (can't go U).\n    - D to (3,1): safe.\n    - R to (4,2): safe (old tail was at (4,2), but now it's at (4,3), so (4,2) is free).\n\nBetween these, moving Left seems to leave more options next turn (can go D or L), whereas Up restricts next move to only U (since R is wall), and Down restricts to D or R.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that all food will disappear after this turn and no immediate reward is possible, the best is to choose a safe move that maintains flexibility. Moving Left seems optimal as it doesn't corner us immediately and keeps options open for next moves.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n2. **Internal Obstacles**: There are additional walls at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake Position**: The snake's body is at [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)], with the head at (2,3) and direction 'L' (Left).\n4. **Food Items**: There are four food items with positions, life spans, and values:\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (1,5): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Snake Movement Constraints\n\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Left ('L').\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot move Right ('R') in the next turn.\n- **Possible Moves**: From the current head position (2,3), the possible moves are:\n  - Up ('U'): (2,4)\n  - Down ('D'): (2,2)\n  - Left ('L'): (1,3)\n  - Right ('R'): Not allowed (reverse of current direction 'L').\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n#### 1. Move Up ('U') to (2,4)\n- **Check for Walls**: \n  - y=4 is a border wall? No, because y=7 and y=0 are borders, but y=4 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4) are walls. (2,4) is an obstacle → **Invalid move** (collision with wall).\n\n#### 2. Move Down ('D') to (2,2)\n- **Check for Walls**: \n  - y=2 is within bounds (0 to 7).\n  - No internal obstacles at (2,2).\n- **Check for Body Collision**: \n  - Current body segments: (3,3), (4,3). (2,2) is not in the body → **Valid move**.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (2,2).\n  - **Action**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Left ('L') to (1,3)\n- **Check for Walls**: \n  - x=1 is within bounds (0 to 7).\n  - No internal obstacles at (1,3).\n- **Check for Body Collision**: \n  - (1,3) is not in the body → **Valid move**.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (1,3).\n  - **Action**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nSince moving Down or Left doesn't lead to immediate food, let's see if any food is reachable in the near future:\n\n1. **Food at (3,5)**: \n   - Current head at (2,3). To reach (3,5), need to move Right then Up twice, but current direction is Left, and Right is not allowed next turn.\n   - **Not immediately reachable**.\n2. **Food at (6,4)**: \n   - Far from current position (2,3). Need multiple moves.\n   - **Not immediately reachable**.\n3. **Food at (6,6)**: \n   - Even farther.\n   - **Not immediately reachable**.\n4. **Food at (1,5)**: \n   - Current head at (2,3). Path: Left to (1,3), then Up to (1,4), but (1,4) is a wall → **Blocked**.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake's tail is at (4,3). The head is at (2,3), so the tail is two cells away (not adjacent). No immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision Between 'D' and 'L'\n\nBoth 'D' and 'L' are safe moves. To decide:\n- **Future Flexibility**: \n  - Moving Down ('D') to (2,2) opens up options to move Left, Right, or Down next turn.\n  - Moving Left ('L') to (1,3) opens up options to move Up, Down, or Left next turn.\n- **Food Proximity**: \n  - 'D' might lead towards the center, potentially closer to future food spawns.\n  - 'L' moves towards the edge, which might limit future options.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe and no immediate food is available, I might prefer 'D' for better central positioning.\n\n### Verifying 'D' Further\n\n- After 'D' to (2,2), next possible moves:\n  - 'U' to (2,3): but (2,3) is the current body segment (second segment after head moves) → **Invalid** (collision).\n  - 'D' to (2,1): Valid.\n  - 'L' to (1,2): Valid.\n  - 'R' to (3,2): Valid.\n\nThis gives more options than moving Left initially.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince moving Down ('D') provides more flexibility for future moves and is safe, I'll choose that.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's break down the current state of the Snake game and decide on the best immediate action to take at Turn \\( t_0 = 8 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)].\n     - Head at (2,2), direction is Down (D).\n     - Body segments: (2,3), (3,3).\n   - Current direction is Down (D), meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Each food is represented as (x, y, life_span, value).\n     - (3,5,2,1): Positive food at (3,5), life span 2, value +1.\n     - (6,4,3,1): Positive food at (6,4), life span 3, value +1.\n     - (6,6,6,1): Positive food at (6,6), life span 6, value +1.\n     - (1,5,9,1): Positive food at (1,5), life span 9, value +1.\n   - All foods are positive (+1), and none are under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2) with direction D (Down), the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (2,1) - but y=1 is within bounds (y=0 is wall), need to check other constraints.\n- **Left (L)**: (1,2) - x=1 is within bounds.\n- **Right (R)**: (3,2) - x=3 is within bounds.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,3) - but this would reverse the direction (from D to U), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\nSo, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Down (D) to (2,1)**:\n   - Check for walls: (2,1) is not listed as a wall (border is y=0, so y=1 is safe).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body segments: (2,3), (3,3).\n     - (2,1) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Food at (2,1)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n   - Check walls: (1,2) is not a wall.\n   - Body collision: (1,2) not in [(2,3), (3,3)].\n   - Food at (1,2)? No.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (3,2)**:\n   - Check walls: (3,2) is not a wall.\n   - Body collision: (3,2) not in [(2,3), (3,3)].\n   - Food at (3,2)? No.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nAll foods are positive, so we'd ideally want to move towards one. Let's see the distances:\n\n1. (3,5): Distance from (2,2) is |3-2| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. (6,4): |6-2| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n3. (6,6): |6-2| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n4. (1,5): |1-2| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nClosest foods are (3,5) and (1,5), both distance 4.\n\n**Path to (3,5)**:\nFrom (2,2), to reach (3,5), we need to go right and up.\n- Next move could be R to (3,2), then U to (3,3), but (3,3) is the tail. Moving to tail is safe only if the tail moves away, which it will if we're not eating food.\nBut currently, no food is at tail, so moving to (3,3) is safe (tail moves to (2,3), new head at (3,3), no collision).\n\nBut let's see if we can plan a path without risking collision.\n\n**Path to (1,5)**:\nFrom (2,2), to reach (1,5), need to go left and up.\n- Next move could be L to (1,2), then U to (1,3), etc.\n\nBoth paths seem viable, but let's check immediate moves.\n\n### Immediate Moves and Future Planning\n\nCurrent possible moves: D, L, R.\n\n- D to (2,1): Moves away from both closest foods.\n- L to (1,2): Starts path towards (1,5).\n- R to (3,2): Starts path towards (3,5).\n\nBetween L and R, both seem equally good in terms of distance to closest food. Let's see if one is safer or more promising:\n\n- Moving R to (3,2):\n  - Next move could be U to (3,3) (tail), then U to (3,4), then R to (4,4) but (4,4) is a wall, so U to (3,5).\n  - So path: R -> U -> U -> U to reach (3,5).\n- Moving L to (1,2):\n  - Next moves could be U to (1,3), U to (1,4), but (1,4) is a wall, so cannot go there.\n  - Alternative: U to (1,3), then L to (0,3) - but x=0 is wall, so cannot.\n  - So from (1,3), must go U to (1,4) - but wall, or R to (2,3), which is body.\n  - Seems like a dead end.\n\nThus, moving R seems better for reaching (3,5), whereas moving L seems to lead to a dead end near walls.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the tail adjacent to head, and does tail have positive food?\n- Tail is at (3,3).\n- Adjacent cells to head (2,2): (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n- Tail is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to (2,2) (distance is |3-2| + |3-2| = 2, not 1).\n- So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the safe moves (D, L, R):\n- D moves away from food.\n- L seems to lead to a dead end near walls.\n- R starts a viable path towards (3,5).\n\nThus, the best immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 9  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6)\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]  \n- Head is at (3,2)\n- Next segment is at (2,2)\n- Tail is at (2,3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right)  \nThis means the snake was moving to the right in the previous turn.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (3,5) - value: 1, life_span: 1\n2. (6,4) - value: 2, life_span: 1\n3. (6,6) - value: 5, life_span: 1\n4. (1,5) - value: 8, life_span: 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,2) and current direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (4,2)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,1)\n  \nCannot move Left (L) because that would be an instant reverse from the current direction R, which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,2)\n- Check if (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Snake body segments: (2,2), (2,3) — no, (4,2) is free.\n- Check for walls:\n  - x=7 is a wall, but x=4 is within bounds (1-6).\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — none at (4,2).\n- Food at (4,2)? No.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't lead to any food immediately.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,3)\n- Check if (3,3) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - (2,2), (2,3) — no.\n- Walls:\n  - y=7 is the upper bound; y=3 is fine.\n  - Internal obstacles: none at (3,3).\n- Food at (3,3)? No.\n  \nThis move is safe but no immediate food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,1)\n- Check if (3,1) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - (2,2), (2,3) — no.\n- Walls:\n  - y=0 is a wall; y=1 is within bounds (1-6).\n  - Internal obstacles: none at (3,1).\n- Food at (3,1)? No.\n  \nThis move is safe but no immediate food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNone of the immediate moves lead directly to food. So, we need to think about paths to reach food in subsequent moves.\n\nLet's look at the food positions:\n1. (3,5) - value 1\n2. (6,4) - value 2\n3. (6,6) - value 5\n4. (1,5) - value 8\n\nThe highest value is at (1,5) with 8, but it's quite far. Next is (6,6) with 5, then (6,4) with 2, and (3,5) with 1.\n\nGiven that all foods have a life_span of 1, they will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So, none of the foods will be available next turn unless we can reach them this turn.\n\nBut currently, none of the foods are adjacent to the head (3,2):\n- (3,5): y=5 is 3 steps up from y=2 — can't reach in one move.\n- (6,4): x=6 is 3 steps right from x=3 — can't reach in one move.\n- (6,6): both x and y are too far.\n- (1,5): x=1 is 2 steps left from x=3 — can't reach in one move.\n\nThis means none of the foods can be eaten this turn because they're not adjacent to the head.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe should also check if the tail has positive food that we might accidentally eat next turn, causing a collision. The tail is at (2,3). Is there food at (2,3)? Looking at the food list:\n- (3,5), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5) — no food at (2,3).\n\nSo, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nSince we can't reach any food this turn, and all foods will disappear next turn, our goal is to stay alive and position ourselves for potential future food.\n\nCurrent possible safe moves: R, U, D.\n\nLet's think about future movements:\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,2):\n  - Next moves could be R to (5,2), U to (4,3), or D to (4,1).\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,3):\n  - Next moves could be R to (4,3), U to (3,4), or L to (2,3) (but L is opposite of current R, so not allowed unless we change direction first).\n- Moving Down (D) to (3,1):\n  - Next moves could be R to (4,1), D to (3,0) (but y=0 is a wall), or L to (2,1).\n\nMoving Down to (3,1) limits our next moves because moving down again would hit the wall. Moving Up seems better for exploring more space.\n\nBetween R and U:\n- Moving R to (4,2) keeps us moving right, which might lead us towards higher x where some foods are (like (6,4) and (6,6)), but they're disappearing.\n- Moving U to (3,3) opens up more space upwards.\n\nGiven that all foods are disappearing, and we need to stay alive, moving Up seems slightly better as it gives more options next turn without immediate constraints.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move is **Up (U)** to (3,3), as it provides more flexibility for future moves without immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 10 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n- Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- Positions: Head at (3,3), then (3,2), then (2,2). So, the snake is three segments long.\n- Current direction: U (Up). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous move.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - (6,4): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (6,6): value=4, life_span=1\n   - (1,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (3,2): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is U (Up), the opposite is D (Down). So, we cannot move Down next.\n- Possible moves: U, L, R (since D is forbidden).\n\n**Deadly Collisions:**\n- Cannot move into walls or the snake's body (except the tail, under certain conditions).\n  \nLet's check each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U): (x,y+1)**\n   - Current head: (3,3) → new position: (3,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,4) is not in the internal obstacles list, and it's within borders (x=3, y=4 is valid).\n     - Body: Snake segments are at (3,3), (3,2), (2,2). (3,4) is not in these.\n   - Food at (3,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Left (L): (x-1,y)**\n   - Current head: (3,3) → new position: (2,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,3) is not in internal obstacles, within borders.\n     - Body: (2,3) is not in snake segments.\n   - Food at (2,3)? No.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Right (R): (x+1,y)**\n   - Current head: (3,3) → new position: (4,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,3) is not in internal obstacles, within borders.\n     - Body: (4,3) is not in snake segments.\n   - Food at (4,3)? No.\n   - Safe move.\n\nAll three moves (U, L, R) seem safe in terms of not causing immediate collisions. Now, let's consider the food positions to decide which move is optimal.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nWe have four food items:\n\n1. (6,4): value=2, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (3,3): |6-3| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n   - To reach it in one move, we'd need to be adjacent, which we're not.\n\n2. (6,6): value=4, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Also disappears after this turn.\n   - Can't reach in one move.\n\n3. (1,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Disappears after this turn.\n   - Can't reach in one move.\n\n4. (3,2): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |3-3| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 = 1\n   - Adjacent to head (directly below, since head is at (3,3), (3,2) is Down).\n   - Current direction is U, so opposite is D, which is forbidden.\n   - Even if we could move D, (3,2) is the second segment of the snake (body).\n     - Special rule: Food under body can only be eaten if:\n       1. Body moves away (tail moves from (2,2), so (3,2) is now empty.\n       2. Head moves onto the food cell.\n     - To eat (3,2), we'd have to move D, but D is forbidden (instant reverse).\n     - So, cannot eat this food now.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger:**\n- Head is at (3,3), tail is at (2,2).\n- Adjacent cells to head: (3,4), (2,3), (4,3), (3,2).\n- Tail is at (2,2), which is adjacent to (2,3) and (3,2).\n- So, head is not adjacent to tail (distance is sqrt( (3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2 ) = sqrt(2), which is more than 1).\n- No immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nSince none of the foods can be eaten in this immediate move (either too far or forbidden to reach), the priority is to stay safe and position ourselves for future moves.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's see where each move takes us:\n\n1. **Up (U): (3,4)**\n   - Next possible moves from (3,4): U, L, R (not D, which would be reverse).\n   - From (3,4), we can explore more of the upper area.\n\n2. **Left (L): (2,3)**\n   - Next possible moves from (2,3): U, L, D (not R, reverse).\n   - Moves us towards the left wall (x=1 is wall at x=0).\n\n3. **Right (R): (4,3)**\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3): U, R, D (not L, reverse).\n   - Moves us towards the right side.\n\nConsidering the food positions:\n- High-value foods are at (6,4), (6,6), (1,5), but all are disappearing after this turn.\n- The food at (3,2) is inaccessible this turn.\n\nNo immediate food to chase, so let's choose a move that keeps options open.\n\n**Choosing Up (U):**\n- Moves us to (3,4), which is safe.\n- From there, we can potentially go towards higher y-values where there might be future food spawns.\n\nAlternative is Left or Right, but without food to chase, Up seems as good as any.\n\n**Potential Issue with Up:**\n- After moving U to (3,4), next turn we cannot move D.\n- Possible next moves: U, L, R.\n- We'd have to see future food positions.\n\nGiven that, and no immediate benefit to L or R, U seems fine.\n\n### Verifying Other Moves\n\nJust to be thorough:\n\n**Left (L): (2,3)**\n- Next to internal obstacle at (2,4), but not an issue yet.\n- Could be a bit limiting as we're moving towards the left wall.\n\n**Right (R): (4,3)**\n- Next to internal obstacle at (4,4), but not an issue.\n- Moves towards right where there's food at (6,4) and (6,6), but they disappear now.\n\nNeither L nor R offers a clear advantage over U in this scenario.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all three moves are safe and no immediate food can be eaten, the choice is somewhat arbitrary. Moving Up seems reasonable to explore the upper part of the grid.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 11  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]  \n- Head is at (3,4), direction is Up (U).\n- Body segments: (3,3), (3,2) (tail)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6,4): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (6,6): value=3, life_span=1\n3. (1,5): value=6, life_span=1\n4. (3,2): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nFrom the head at (3,4), moving Up (U) would go to (3,5). But let's check all possible directions considering the current direction is U (so we can't instantly reverse to D unless we have no other choice, but let's see):\n\n- **Up (U)**: (3,4) → (3,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,4) → (3,3) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so this would cause a collision unless the tail moves away. But the tail is at (3,2), so moving down would make the head go to (3,3) and the body would move from (3,3) to (3,2), and tail from (3,2) moves away. So the new positions would be [(3,3), (3,4), (3,3)], which means the head is at (3,3) and the next segment is (3,4), and then (3,3) again — this is a collision because the head is at (3,3) and another body segment is also at (3,3). So moving Down is invalid (would cause collision).\n  \nWait, let's think carefully about moving Down:\nCurrent positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\nMove Down: head goes to (3,3), body moves:\n- (3,3) was the first body segment, now it's at (3,4) (since the head was at (3,4) and moved down to (3,3))\n- (3,2) was the tail, now it's at (3,3) (but the head is also moving to (3,3), so collision. Wait no, the tail moves away, but the head is moving to where the first body segment was, which is now moving to (3,4), so new positions would be [(3,3), (3,4), (3,3)] — head at (3,3), next at (3,4), then at (3,3) — so head is at (3,3) and another segment is at (3,3), which is a collision. So Down is invalid.\n\n- **Left (L)**: (3,4) → (2,4)\n  - Check if (2,4) is a wall or body:\n    - Internal obstacles include (2,4), so this is a wall. Can't move Left.\n  \n- **Right (R)**: (3,4) → (4,4)\n  - Check if (4,4) is a wall or body:\n    - Internal obstacles include (4,4), so this is a wall. Can't move Right.\n\nSo from current position (3,4) with direction U, possible moves:\n- U: (3,5) — need to check if this is safe\n- D: invalid (collision)\n- L: wall\n- R: wall\n\nOnly possible move is Up to (3,5). But let's check if that's safe.\n\n### Checking Move Up to (3,5)\n\n- New head position: (3,5)\n- Check for walls: (3,5) is not listed as a wall (border walls are y=0 and y=7, and no internal obstacle at (3,5))\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Current body segments are at (3,3) and (3,2), moving to (3,5) doesn't overlap with these.\n  \nSo moving Up to (3,5) seems safe.\n\n### Checking Food at (3,5)\n\nIs there any food at (3,5)? Looking at the food list:\n- (6,4)\n- (6,6)\n- (1,5)\n- (3,2)\n\nNo food at (3,5), so moving Up won't eat any food this turn.\n\n### Considering Food Items\n\nLet's look at the food items to see if any are reachable or pose risks:\n\n1. (6,4): value=1, life=1\n   - Distance from (3,4): |6-3| + |4-4| = 3\n   - Can't reach in one move, life is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Not relevant now.\n2. (6,6): value=3, life=1\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n   - Life 1, will disappear. Not reachable now.\n3. (1,5): value=6, life=1\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Life 1, will disappear. Not reachable now.\n4. (3,2): value=9, life=1\n   - This is the current tail position.\n   - To eat this, the head would need to move to (3,2) after the tail moves away.\n   - Currently, tail is at (3,2), next is (3,3), head at (3,4).\n   - If we move Up to (3,5), next turn tail moves from (3,2) to (3,3), body from (3,3) to (3,4), head to (3,5).\n   - Then, to eat (3,2), the food would have to still be there, but its life is 1, so at turn 12 it will disappear. So can't eat it.\n   - Also, even if it stayed, moving to (3,2) would require the head to be adjacent to the tail, which is dangerous if it's positive food (Tail Reward Danger). Here, value is +9, so eating it would kill the snake because the head and newly grown tail would collide.\n\nSo none of the food is safely eatable this turn or next.\n\n### Checking Other Move Possibilities\n\nWait, we thought only Up is possible, but let's re-examine Down, Left, Right:\n\n- Down: leads to collision, as discussed.\n- Left: (2,4) is a wall.\n- Right: (4,4) is a wall.\n  \nSo only Up is possible without dying.\n\n### Verifying No Other Options\n\nIs there any other consideration? Maybe the food under the snake's body:\n\nCurrent tail is at (3,2) with food (3,2,9,1). But as discussed, eating it is dangerous and not possible this turn since the head can't reach it without the tail moving away first, and by then the food will disappear.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Up to (3,5). All other moves lead to walls or collisions.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 12  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the wall coordinates, it seems like the grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n- Internal obstacles (walls inside the grid):\n  - (5, 6)\n  - (1, 4)\n  - (4, 4)\n  - (2, 4)\n  - (6, 3)\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions (head first): [(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)]\n  - Head at (3, 5)\n  - Next segment at (3, 4)\n  - Tail at (3, 3)\n- Current direction: U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6, 6): value = 3, life_span = 1\n2. (1, 5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n3. (3, 2): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 5) and direction U, the possible next moves are:\n- U (Up): (3, 6)\n- L (Left): (2, 5)\n- R (Right): (4, 5)\n- D (Down): (3, 4) — but this is the body segment, so it's a collision unless it's the tail that's about to move.\n\nHowever, since the current direction is U, the snake cannot instantly reverse to D (Down) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\n**1. Move U (Up) to (3, 6)**:\n- Check for walls: y=7 is a wall, but (3,6) is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision: Snake body is at (3,4) and (3,3), so no collision.\n- Check for food: No food at (3,6).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n**2. Move L (Left) to (2, 5)**:\n- Check for walls: x=0 is a wall, but (2,5) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3) — none at (2,5).\n- Check for body collision: Snake body is at (3,4) and (3,3), no collision.\n- Check for food: Food at (1,5) is nearby but not at (2,5).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n**3. Move R (Right) to (4, 5)**:\n- Check for walls: x=7 is a wall, but (4,5) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: none at (4,5).\n- Check for body collision: Snake body is at (3,4) and (3,3), no collision.\n- Check for food: No food at (4,5).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nLooking at the food items:\n1. (6,6): value 3, life_span 1 — will disappear next turn.\n   - Current distance from head (3,5): |6-3| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4 (Manhattan distance).\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n2. (1,5): value 5, life_span 1 — will disappear next turn.\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n   - Can reach in two moves: first move L to (2,5), then next move L to (1,5).\n   - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn (turn 12), so cannot reach in time.\n3. (3,2): value 8, life_span 1 — will disappear next turn.\n   - Distance: |3-3| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo, none of the food items can be eaten this turn. The best we can do is position ourselves for future moves where food might appear or where we can safely extend the snake.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (3,3). Adjacent cells to the head (3,5) are:\n- (3,6) — U\n- (2,5) — L\n- (4,5) — R\n- (3,4) — D (but can't move here due to body and no instant reverse)\n\nIs any of these adjacent to the tail (3,3)?\n- Distance from (3,3) to (3,6): |3-3| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- To (2,5): |2-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4,5): |4-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (3,4): |3-3| + |4-3| = 0 + 1 = 1 — but can't move here.\n\nNone of the possible moves are adjacent to the tail, so no tail reward danger.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll possible moves (U, L, R) are safe with no immediate reward. We should choose a move that:\n- Keeps us away from walls and obstacles.\n- Potentially opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving U to (3,6): close to top wall (y=7), but still has space.\n- Moving L to (2,5): near internal obstacles at (1,4) and (2,4), but not directly next to them.\n- Moving R to (4,5): near internal obstacle at (4,4), but not directly next to it.\n\nMoving R seems slightly better as it's away from the cluster of internal obstacles on the left (1,4), (2,4), (4,4). Also, moving right might give more space to maneuver in the future.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Threats\n\nAfter moving R to (4,5), next possible moves would be from (4,5):\n- Current direction would be R (since we moved right).\n- Possible next moves: R (to (5,5)), U (to (4,6)), D (to (4,4)).\n  - (5,5): no wall or body.\n  - (4,6): no wall or body, but there's an obstacle at (5,6) nearby.\n  - (4,4): obstacle at (4,4), so can't go there.\n\nSo, moving R now keeps options open for next moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, moving **Right (R)** seems the most prudent choice to maintain flexibility and avoid immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,5), then (3,5), then (3,4).\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (6,6): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (1,5): value=4, life_span=1\n   - (3,2): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (3,4): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's sketch the immediate surroundings of the snake's head at (4,5):\n\n- Current direction is Right (R), so the snake just moved to the right to reach (4,5).\n- Previous position was (3,5), so the tail is moving from (3,4) to (3,5) next.\n\nAdjacent cells to the head (4,5):\n\n- Up (U): (4,6)\n- Down (D): (4,4)\n- Left (L): (3,5) - this is the body segment right after the head (invalid move, would collide)\n- Right (R): (5,5)\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,5):\n\nGiven the current direction is R, the opposite direction is L, which is invalid (can't reverse instantly). So possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (5,5)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=5 is not a border wall (x=7 is), and (5,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check for body: Snake body is at (3,5) and (3,4), so (5,5) is safe.\n   - Food at (5,5)? No, no food there.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - Walls: y=6 is not a border wall (y=7 is), and no internal obstacles at (4,6).\n   - Body: Not occupied by body.\n   - Food: No food at (4,6).\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - Walls: y=4 is not a border wall, but (4,4) is an internal obstacle.\n   - So, cannot move to (4,4) - it's a wall.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nWait, looking back at internal obstacles: (4,4) is listed. So D is invalid.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nNow, let's look at the food items:\n\n1. (6,6): value=2, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (4,5): |6-4| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn (since countdown decreases this turn).\n   - Too far to reach in one move.\n\n2. (1,5): value=4, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |1-4| + |5-5| = 3\n   - Also disappears after this turn, too far.\n\n3. (3,2): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |3-4| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Disappears after this turn, too far.\n\n4. (3,4): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |3-4| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Adjacent to head? Head is at (4,5), food at (3,4). \n   - To reach (3,4) from (4,5), need to move Left (L), but current direction is R, so L is opposite and invalid.\n   - Alternatively, could move Down to (4,4) then Left to (3,4), but (4,4) is a wall.\n   - Also, (3,4) is currently occupied by the tail. Special case: food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n   - Current tail is at (3,4), next turn tail will move to (3,5), so (3,4) will be free.\n   - But to eat (3,4), head must move to it next turn. But this turn, cannot move Left (opposite direction).\n   - So cannot eat (3,4) this turn or next, because next turn cannot move Left unless we change direction now.\n   - This seems tricky. Maybe not possible to eat this food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food adjacent that can be eaten this turn?\n\nFrom (4,5), adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,6): no food\n- (5,5): no food\n- (4,4): wall\n- (3,5): body, no food\n\nNo immediate food to eat.\n\n### Potential Moves\n\nFrom above, possible safe moves are U or R.\n\n1. U to (4,6):\n   - No food, safe.\n   - Next moves could be towards (6,6) if it respawns, but it's disappearing this turn.\n\n2. R to (5,5):\n   - No food, safe.\n   - Moves towards center, more options next turn.\n\nBetween U and R, R seems better as it moves towards the center where more food might appear, and avoids getting boxed in.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food on tail?\n\nTail is at (3,4). Head is at (4,5). Adjacent? \n\nDistance: |4-3| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1: same x and y differs by 1 or vice versa).\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Right (R) to (5,5), as it's safe and maintains flexibility.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However, since it's currently moving Right (R), it cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move. So, possible immediate moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,5)\n- **New Head Position**: (6,5)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=6 is not a border wall (border is x=7).\n  - (6,5) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Current body segments: (4,5), (3,5). (6,5) is not in these.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (6,5).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,6)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,6)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - y=6 is not a border wall (border is y=7).\n  - (5,6) is an internal obstacle (from the list).\n- **Outcome**: Collision with wall. Deadly. Cannot move here.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,4)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,4)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - y=4 is not a border wall.\n  - Check internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,4) is not listed.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Body segments: (4,5), (3,5). (5,4) is not in these.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - Food at (3,4), (6,6), (1,5), (3,2). (5,4) has no food.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 4. Move Left (L) to (4,5)\n- **New Head Position**: (4,5)\n- **Check for Instant Reverse**:\n  - Current direction is R, opposite is L. This is an instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n- **Outcome**: Invalid move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (R to (6,5) and D to (5,4)), neither directly eats food. However, let's see if moving towards food is beneficial in the next steps.\n\n**Food at (6,6)**:\n- Current head at (5,5). To reach (6,6), path could be R to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n  - But (6,6) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So by next turn, it won't be there.\n  - Hence, cannot reach (6,6) in time.\n\n**Food at (1,5)**:\n- Far left, at (1,5). Current head at (5,5). Would need multiple L moves, but first move cannot be L (instant reverse). Next possible is after moving R or D.\n  - Life_span=1, disappears after this turn. Cannot reach in time.\n\n**Food at (3,2)**:\n- At (3,2), life_span=1. Cannot reach in time from (5,5).\n\n**Food at (3,4)**:\n- At (3,4), life_span=1. Cannot reach in time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that could be dangerous if eaten?\n- Current body segments: (4,5), (3,5).\n- Food positions: (6,6), (1,5), (3,2), (3,4). None are under the body.\n\n### Decision Between R and D\n\nBoth R to (6,5) and D to (5,4) are safe with no immediate food. Let's see which is better for future moves:\n\n1. **Move R to (6,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (6,5): U (to (6,6)), D (to (6,4)), R (to (7,5) - wall), L (to (5,5) - body segment (4,5) will have moved to (5,5)? Wait, let's see:\n     - After moving R to (6,5), body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)].\n     - Next head at (6,5), body at (5,5), (4,5).\n     - Possible moves:\n       - U to (6,6): but (6,6) is food with life_span=1, which will be gone by next turn.\n       - D to (6,4): check walls - (6,3) is wall, but (6,4) is not listed as wall. Safe.\n       - R to (7,5): x=7 is wall. Deadly.\n       - L to (5,5): body segment is at (5,5). Collision unless tail moves.\n         - Tail is at (4,5), will move to (3,5)? Wait, snake movement: head moves to (6,5), then body segments follow:\n           - Original: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n           - After R: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] (tail (3,5) is gone)\n           - Next move L to (5,5): head at (5,5), body at (6,5), (5,5) - collision with body at (5,5).\n         - So L is deadly.\n   - So from (6,5), only safe move is D to (6,4).\n\n2. **Move D to (5,4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (5,4): U (to (5,5) - body will be at (5,5), (4,5)), R (to (6,4)), D (to (5,3)), L (to (4,4) - which is an internal obstacle).\n     - U to (5,5): body will be at (5,5), (4,5). Head at (5,5) collides with body at (5,5). Deadly.\n     - R to (6,4): check walls - (6,3) is wall, (6,4) is not listed. Safe.\n     - D to (5,3): check walls - y=3 is not border, (6,3) is wall but (5,3) is not listed. Safe.\n     - L to (4,4): internal obstacle. Deadly.\n   - So from (5,4), safe moves are R to (6,4) or D to (5,3).\n\nComparing both initial moves:\n- Moving R now leads to a position where next move is only D to (6,4).\n- Moving D now leads to a position where next moves are R to (6,4) or D to (5,3).\n\nMoving D now seems slightly better as it offers more options next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest immediate move is **Down (D)** to (5,4), as it provides more flexibility for future moves compared to moving Right.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 15 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move to these coordinates.\n- Internal obstacles (walls): (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). The snake can't move into these cells either.\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions: Head at (5,4), then (5,5), then (4,5). So, the body segments are at (5,5) and (4,5).\n- Current direction: Down (D). This means the last move was from (5,5) to (5,4), moving downward.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (1,5): value = +1, life_span = 3\n2. (3,2): value = +1, life_span = 5\n3. (3,4): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\nAll food is positive, so no negative food to worry about here.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (5,4), current direction is D (down). The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but:\n- **No instant reverse**: Last move was D, so cannot move U (up) next. So, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D): (5,4) → (5,3)\n- New head position: (5,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: \n    - Border: y=0 is at bottom, y=7 at top. (5,3) is within borders.\n    - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,3) is not in this list.\n  - Body: \n    - Current body segments: (5,5), (4,5). After moving, the tail moves from (4,5) to (5,5), so new body is (5,5), (5,4). \n    - New head at (5,3) doesn't collide with (5,5) or (5,4).\n- Food: \n  - Is there food at (5,3)? Checking food positions: (1,5), (3,2), (3,4). No, so no food eaten.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L): (5,4) → (4,4)\n- New head position: (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,4) is an internal obstacle. Cannot move here.\n- Conclusion: Invalid move (hits wall).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R): (5,4) → (6,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: \n    - Border: x=7 is rightmost, (6,4) is within.\n    - Internal obstacles: (6,3) is a wall, but (6,4) is not listed.\n  - Body: \n    - New body after move: (5,5), (5,4). \n    - Head at (6,4) doesn't collide with these.\n- Food: \n  - Is there food at (6,4)? No.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, the food is at:\n1. (1,5): life_span = 3\n2. (3,2): life_span = 5\n3. (3,4): life_span = 8\n\nAt turn 15, life_span counts down each turn, including current. So:\n- (1,5): disappears at turn 15 + 3 = turn 18\n- (3,2): disappears at turn 20\n- (3,4): disappears at turn 23\n\nAll food is positive, so we'd like to eat any if possible safely.\n\nFrom head at (5,4), distances to food:\n1. (1,5): Manhattan distance = |5-1| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n2. (3,2): |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n3. (3,4): |5-3| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nClosest is (3,4) at distance 2. Let's see how to reach it.\n\nFrom (5,4):\n- To reach (3,4), need to move left twice: first to (4,4), but (4,4) is a wall. So cannot go directly left.\nAlternative path:\n- Move left to (4,4) - blocked.\n- Move down to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then up to (4,4) - but (4,4) is wall.\nSeems no direct path to (3,4) without hitting walls soon.\n\nNext closest is (3,2) at distance 4. Path could be:\n- Right to (6,4), then down to (6,3) - but (6,3) is wall.\n- Down to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then down to (4,2), then left to (3,2). This seems possible but long.\n\n(1,5) is at distance 5. Path could be:\n- Up to (5,5) - but current body is at (5,5), so would collide unless tail moves.\nWait, let's check tail movement.\n\nIf we move up to (5,5):\n- Current body: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n- After move up: head at (5,5), body becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,5)] - wait no, original body is (5,5), (4,5). After move, tail moves from (4,5) to (5,5), so new body is (5,4), (5,5). Head at (5,5) would collide with (5,5) - no, wait, the segment that was at (5,5) moves to (5,4), and head is at (5,5). So no collision because the old (5,5) is now at (5,4).\n\nBut is there food at (5,5)? No, food is at (1,5), (3,2), (3,4). So moving up doesn't eat food, just moves towards (1,5).\n\nBut moving up is reversing direction from D to U, which is not allowed (no instant reverse). Current direction is D, so cannot move U next.\n\nSo cannot move up to (5,5).\n\nThus, immediate options are D or R, both safe but don't eat food.\n\nBetween D and R:\n- D: (5,3)\n- R: (6,4)\n\nWhich is better for future paths?\n\nFrom (5,3):\n- Can go L to (4,3), then down to (4,2), then L to (3,2) to reach food at (3,2).\nFrom (6,4):\n- Can go D to (6,3) - but (6,3) is wall.\n- So from (6,4), limited options.\n\nThus, moving D to (5,3) seems better for future pathing towards food at (3,2).\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail where tail cell has positive food?\n- Tail is at (4,5).\n- Head is at (5,4). Adjacent cells to head: (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4).\n- Tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to head (distance is |5-4| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, not 1).\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate safe moves are D or R, both don't eat food. D seems better for future pathing towards food at (3,2).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 16  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]  \nThis means:\n- Head at (5,3)\n- Body segment at (5,4)\n- Tail at (5,5)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis implies the snake was moving downward in the previous move, from (5,4) to (5,3).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1,5): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (3,2): value=4, life_span=1\n3. (3,4): value=7, life_span=1\n4. (1,1): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,3) with direction D (Down), the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (5,4) - But this is the body segment, so moving here would cause a collision (deadly).\n- **D (Down)**: (5,2) - Need to check if this is valid.\n- **L (Left)**: (4,3) - Need to check.\n- **R (Right)**: (6,3) - Internal obstacle at (6,3), so cannot move here.\n\n**No instant reverse**: Since current direction is D, cannot move U next. But moving U is already invalid due to body collision, so this rule reinforces that U is not allowed.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Move D (Down) to (5,2)**:\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, but (5,2) is not on the border (y=0 is (5,0), so (5,2) is fine).\n   - Check obstacles: (5,2) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (5,4) and (5,5), so no collision.\n   - Food at (5,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move L (Left) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but (4,3) is not on the border.\n   - Check obstacles: (4,3) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n   - Check body: No body segments at (4,3).\n   - Food at (4,3)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move R (Right) to (6,3)**:\n   - Internal obstacle at (6,3), so cannot move here.\n\n4. **Move U (Up) to (5,4)**:\n   - Body segment at (5,4), so collision → deadly, cannot do this.\n\nSo, possible safe moves are D to (5,2) or L to (4,3). Both don't lead to food immediately.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nLet's see where the food is and if we can plan to reach any:\n\n1. (1,5): value=2, life_span=1\n   - Current turn is 16, so disappears at turn 16 + 1 = 17.\n   - To reach (1,5) from (5,3) in one move: impossible, distance is |5-1| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6 > 1.\n   - Not reachable next turn.\n\n2. (3,2): value=4, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 17.\n   - Distance: |5-3| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 > 1.\n   - Not reachable next turn.\n\n3. (3,4): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 17.\n   - Distance: |5-3| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 > 1.\n   - Not reachable next turn.\n\n4. (1,1): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 17.\n   - Distance: |5-1| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6 > 1.\n   - Not reachable next turn.\n\nNone of the food items can be reached in the next move. So, the immediate moves are just about staying safe.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nEven though we can't reach food now, let's see which move might set us up better for future food collection.\n\n- **Move D to (5,2)**:\n  - Next position: head at (5,2), body at (5,3), (5,4).\n  - Possible next moves from (5,2): U (back to (5,3) - body, no), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n    - (6,2): check obstacles - (6,3) is an obstacle, but (6,2) is not listed, so likely safe unless it's a wall, but x=6 is not a border wall (border is x=7), so safe.\n  \n- **Move L to (4,3)**:\n  - Next position: head at (4,3), body at (5,3), (5,4).\n  - Possible next moves from (4,3): U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3) - body, no.\n    - (4,4): internal obstacle at (4,4), so cannot.\n    - (3,3): no obstacles, not a wall.\n    - (4,2): no obstacles.\n\nBetween D and L, both seem safe with no immediate advantage. Maybe choose the one that opens up more options next.\n\nMoving D to (5,2) would allow next moves D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).  \nMoving L to (4,3) would allow next moves D to (4,2), L to (3,3).\n\nBoth seem similar in terms of future options. Maybe prefer moving towards the center to have more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, check if any food is in a general direction:\n\n- (3,2) is to the left and down from (5,3). Moving L to (4,3) is a step towards that.\n- (3,4) is to the left and up, but moving up is not possible now.\n- (1,5) is far left and up.\n- (1,1) is far left and down.\n\nMoving L seems to generally move towards some food items, even if not immediately.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is on the tail (5,5): No food is listed at (5,5), so no danger from that.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth D and L are safe, but L might be slightly better as it moves generally towards some food items. Since no immediate food is reachable, and both moves are safe, I'll choose L to (4,3).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 17 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since borders are at x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7).\n- Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions: Head at (4,3), then (5,3), then (5,4). So the body segments are at (5,3) and (5,4).\n- Current direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left to reach (4,3) from (5,3).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - (1,5): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (3,2): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (3,4): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (1,1): value=9, life_span=1\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,3), possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (4,4)\n- Down (D): (4,2)\n- Left (L): (3,3)\n- Right (R): (5,3)\n\nBut we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is L, so we cannot move Right (R) next.\n- **Wall collisions**: Check if the move hits a wall.\n- **Body collisions**: Check if the move hits the body (excluding the tail if we're moving into its current position, since the tail will move forward).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Up (U) to (4,4):**\n- Check walls: (4,4) is an internal obstacle (from the list). So, this is a wall. **Invalid move** (would cause collision).\n\n**2. Down (D) to (4,2):**\n- Check walls: No walls at (4,2).\n- Check body: Snake body is at (5,3) and (5,4). (4,2) is not part of the body. **Valid move**.\n- Food: No food at (4,2). So, no score change, just move.\n\n**3. Left (L) to (3,3):**\n- Check walls: No walls at (3,3).\n- Check body: (3,3) is not part of the body. **Valid move**.\n- Food: No food at (3,3). Just move.\n\n**4. Right (R) to (5,3):**\n- Current direction is L, so R is opposite. **Invalid move** (instant reverse not allowed).\n\nSo, valid moves are Down (D) and Left (L).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, between D and L, which is better?\n\n**Left (L) to (3,3):**\n- Next possible moves from (3,3):\n  - U: (3,4) - has food (3,4,6,1). But need to check if eating is safe.\n  - D: (3,2) - has food (3,2,3,1).\n  - L: (2,3) - no food.\n  - R: (4,3) - body segment (but tail is at (5,4), so after moving, tail moves from (5,4) to (5,3), so (4,3) is now empty. But the head was at (4,3), moving to (3,3), then back to (4,3) would be where the body segment (5,3) moves to (5,3)? Wait, need to visualize snake movement.\n\nActually, after moving left to (3,3), the snake's new positions would be:\n- Head: (3,3)\n- Body: (4,3), (5,3) - tail at (5,3) moves away from (5,4).\n\nNext turn, if we go right to (4,3), that's where the body segment (4,3) is, but the tail (5,3) would move to (5,?), no, wait, the body is now (4,3),(5,3), so tail is (5,3), which was the previous body segment. Moving right to (4,3) would collide with (4,3). So right is not safe next turn.\n\nAlternative is to go up to (3,4) where food is (value=6). But need to check if eating it is safe:\n- Eating at (3,4): snake grows to length 4: head at (3,4), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).\n- Then next turn, tail is at (5,3), head at (3,4). Adjacent cells to head: (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3). Tail is at (5,3), not adjacent to head. So no tail reward danger.\nBut (4,4) is a wall, so can't move there. Other moves would be safe.\n\nBut this is planning ahead, and we're supposed to decide immediate action based on current state and possibly past plan, but no past plan is given.\n\n**Down (D) to (4,2):**\n- Next possible moves from (4,2):\n  - U: back to (4,3) - but current direction is D, so U is opposite, invalid next turn.\n  - D: (4,1) - no food, no walls.\n  - L: (3,2) - has food (3,2,3,1).\n  - R: (5,2) - no food, no walls.\n\nFood at (3,2) is value=3. Eating it would grow snake to length 4: head at (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3).\nThen tail is at (5,3). Adjacent to head at (3,2): (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). Tail is at (5,3), not adjacent. Safe.\n\nBut again, this is planning ahead.\n\n### Immediate Rewards\n\nLooking at current turn, no food is at (4,2) or (3,3). So both moves don't give immediate reward. But both can lead to food next turn.\n\nBetween (3,3) and (4,2), which is better?\n\nFrom (3,3), next turn can go to (3,4) with food value=6 or (3,2) with value=3.\nFrom (4,2), next turn can go to (3,2) with value=3 or (5,2) no food.\n\nSo (3,3) seems better because it offers higher value food next turn.\n\nBut also, food at (3,4) has higher value (6) than (3,2) (3), so aiming for that seems better.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nAt current state, tail is at (5,4). Adjacent to head at (4,3):\nAdjacent cells to (4,3): (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3).\nTail is at (5,4), which is adjacent to (5,3), but not directly to head unless head moves to (5,3), which is invalid (instant reverse).\n\nNo food is under the tail currently (tail is at (5,4), no food there), so no tail reward danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween D and L, L seems better because it sets up to reach higher value food next turn.\n\nBut let's check if moving left to (3,3) is safe in terms of future moves:\nAfter moving to (3,3), snake is at [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)].\nNext turn, can go U to (3,4) to eat food (value=6), which is safe as checked earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving D to (4,2) leads to less valuable food next turn.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nGiven that moving Left sets up for higher value food next turn without immediate dangers, and moving Down leads to lower value food, Left seems the better immediate action.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what the constraints are.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Additional walls at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (3,3), followed by body segments at (4,3) and (5,3).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Left (L), meaning the head's last move was from (4,3) to (3,3).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3,2): value=3, life_span=1 (positive food)\n   - (3,4): value=5, life_span=1 (positive food)\n   - (1,1): value=8, life_span=1 (positive food)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the snake is currently moving Left (L), it cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, the possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (2,3)\n- **New Head Position**: (2,3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - x=0 is a wall, but (2,3) is not on the border.\n    - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is a wall, but (2,3) is not listed as a wall.\n  - **Body**: \n    - Current body segments are at (4,3) and (5,3). (2,3) is not part of the body.\n  - **Valid Move**: Yes.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (2,3).\n  - **Outcome**: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,4)\n- **New Head Position**: (3,4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - y=7 is the top border, but (3,4) is not on the border.\n    - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is a wall, but (3,4) is not listed as a wall.\n  - **Body**: \n    - (3,4) is not part of the current body [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)].\n  - **Valid Move**: Yes.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - Food at (3,4) with value=5, life_span=1.\n  - **Eating Food**: \n    - The head moves onto (3,4), which has positive food.\n    - **Tail Check**: \n      - Current tail is at (5,3). \n      - Distance from new head (3,4) to tail (5,3): \n        - x-difference: |3-5|=2, y-difference: |4-3|=1, total=3 (not adjacent).\n      - No immediate collision risk from growing the tail.\n    - **Safe to Eat**: Yes.\n    - **Outcome**: Eat food, gain +1 score, length increases by 1.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,2)\n- **New Head Position**: (3,2)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - y=0 is the bottom border, but (3,2) is not on the border.\n    - Internal obstacles: No walls at (3,2).\n  - **Body**: \n    - (3,2) is not part of the current body.\n  - **Valid Move**: Yes.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - Food at (3,2) with value=3, life_span=1.\n  - **Eating Food**: \n    - The head moves onto (3,2), which has positive food.\n    - **Tail Check**: \n      - Current tail is at (5,3).\n      - Distance from new head (3,2) to tail (5,3): \n        - x-difference: |3-5|=2, y-difference: |2-3|=1, total=3 (not adjacent).\n      - No immediate collision risk from growing the tail.\n    - **Safe to Eat**: Yes.\n    - **Outcome**: Eat food, gain +1 score, length increases by 1.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nNow, let's compare the outcomes of the possible moves:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate gain.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (3,4)**:\n   - Eat food at (3,4) with value=5.\n   - Gain +1 score, length +1.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - Eat food at (3,2) with value=3.\n   - Gain +1 score, length +1.\n   - Safe move.\n\nBoth Up and Down allow eating positive food safely. Now, let's consider the food values and positions:\n\n- (3,4): value=5\n- (3,2): value=3\n\nThe food at (3,4) has a higher value (5 vs 3), so it's preferable to eat that one if possible. \n\nAdditionally, let's check the life spans: both foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. So, we have to choose one to eat this turn; the other will disappear.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Eating\n\nAfter eating at (3,4):\n- New snake positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] (length 4).\n- Next moves would be from (3,4).\n\nAfter eating at (3,2):\n- New snake positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] (length 4).\n- Next moves would be from (3,2).\n\nLooking at the remaining food:\n- After eating at (3,4), the food at (3,2) disappears, leaving only (1,1) which is far.\n- After eating at (3,2), the food at (3,4) disappears, leaving only (1,1).\n\nBoth options leave us with only the distant (1,1) food next. However, the higher value at (3,4) makes it the better immediate choice.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Up to (3,4)?\n\n- Current body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).\n- After moving to (3,4), the body becomes (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).\n- Next possible moves from (3,4):\n  - Left (L) to (2,4): \n    - Check walls: (2,4) is an internal obstacle (wall). Invalid.\n  - Right (R) to (4,4): \n    - (4,4) is an internal obstacle (wall). Invalid.\n  - Up (U) to (3,5): \n    - Not a wall, not part of the new body. Valid.\n  - Down (D) to (3,3): \n    - (3,3) is part of the body (second segment). Collision. Invalid.\n  - So, only Up is valid next move after going to (3,4).\n\nThis is a bit restrictive, but not immediately deadly. After moving Up to (3,5), we can reassess then.\n\nSimilarly, if we move Down to (3,2):\n\n- New body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).\n- Next moves from (3,2):\n  - Left (L) to (2,2): \n    - Not a wall, not body. Valid.\n  - Right (R) to (4,2): \n    - Not a wall, not body. Valid.\n  - Up (U) to (3,3): \n    - (3,3) is body. Collision. Invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (3,1): \n    - Not a wall, not body. Valid.\n  - More options than after moving Up.\n\nHowever, the immediate higher value at (3,4) still makes it the better choice despite fewer next moves.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne critical rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (5,3).\n- After moving Up to (3,4), the new tail is at (4,3) (since the snake grows by 1).\n- Distance from new head (3,4) to new tail (4,3):\n  - x-diff: |3-4|=1, y-diff: |4-3|=1, total=2 (adjacent diagonally, but adjacency is usually considered orthogonally, so not adjacent in terms of U/D/L/R moves).\n- So, no immediate collision from the new tail.\n\nSimilarly, moving Down to (3,2):\n- New tail is at (4,3).\n- Distance from (3,2) to (4,3):\n  - x-diff:1, y-diff:1, same as above.\n- No adjacency.\n\nThus, no tail reward danger in either case.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (3,4) to eat the higher-value food (value=5) safely, gaining +1 score and increasing the snake's length by 1.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: \n  - (5, 6)\n  - (1, 4)\n  - (4, 4)\n  - (2, 4)\n  - (6, 3)\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions**: \n  - Head: (3, 4)\n  - Body: (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)\n- **Direction**: U (Up, meaning the snake is currently moving upwards, i.e., increasing y-coordinate).\n\n#### Food:\n1. (3, 2): value = 1, life_span = 2\n2. (1, 1): value = 1, life_span = 7\n3. (2, 3): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (3, 4) and direction U, the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (3, 5)\n- **D (Down)**: (3, 3) — but this is the opposite of current direction U, so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **L (Left)**: (2, 4)\n- **R (Right)**: (4, 4)\n\nSo, the allowed moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move:\n\n#### 1. Move U (Up) to (3, 5):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=5 is not a border wall (y=7 is the upper border), and (3,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n  - **Body**: The snake's body is at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). (3,5) is not part of the body.\n- **Food**: No food at (3,5).\n- **Next State**:\n  - New head: (3,5)\n  - Body: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (5,3) is removed.\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate risks.\n\n#### 2. Move L (Left) to (2, 4):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=2 is not a border wall, but we need to check internal obstacles. (2,4) is listed as an internal obstacle.\n  - **Body**: (2,4) is not part of the current body.\n- **Obstacle**: (2,4) is an internal obstacle → cannot move here.\n- **Result**: Invalid move due to wall collision.\n\n#### 3. Move R (Right) to (4, 4):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=4 is not a border wall. (4,4) is listed as an internal obstacle.\n  - **Body**: (4,4) is not part of the current body.\n- **Obstacle**: (4,4) is an internal obstacle → cannot move here.\n- **Result**: Invalid move due to wall collision.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves:\nFrom the above, only U is a valid move. L and R are blocked by internal obstacles.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other consideration:\n\n#### Tail Reward Danger:\n- The tail is at (5,3). Is there any food adjacent to the head that is also at the tail?\n  - Head is at (3,4). Adjacent cells to head:\n    - (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3)\n  - Tail is at (5,3). Adjacent to tail:\n    - (5,4), (4,3), (6,3), (5,2)\n  - Overlapping adjacent cells: None between head's adjacent and tail's position.\n- Food at (3,2), (1,1), (2,3):\n  - (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3) (body), not directly to head unless moving down (invalid).\n  - (2,3) is adjacent to (3,3) (body), not directly to head unless moving left (invalid due to wall).\n  - (1,1) is far.\n- No immediate tail reward danger.\n\n#### Food Considerations:\n- Food at (3,2): life_span = 2, so it will disappear after 2 more turns (including current turn). To eat it:\n  - Need to move head to (3,2) in the next move, which would require moving down from (3,4) to (3,3) (invalid reverse), then to (3,2). Not possible immediately.\n- Food at (2,3): life_span = 10, can consider later.\n- Food at (1,1): life_span = 7, can consider later.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly valid move is U (Up) to (3,5). Other moves are blocked by walls or are invalid due to instant reverse.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 20 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)].\n  - Head at (3,5), next segment at (3,4), then (3,3), tail at (4,3).\n- Current direction: Up (U).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Three food items:\n  1. (3,2): value=1, life_span=1.\n  2. (1,1): value=1, life_span=6.\n  3. (2,3): value=1, life_span=9.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (3,5) and Direction U:\n\nFrom direction U, possible moves are:\n- Continue Up (U): (3,6).\n- Left (L): (2,5).\n- Right (R): (4,5).\nCannot go Down (D) because that's the opposite of current direction U (no instant reverse).\n\n**Check each possible move for validity and safety:**\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (3,6):**\n- Check walls:\n  - y=7 is a wall, (3,6) is not a wall.\n  - Internal walls: (3,6) is not in the list.\n- Check body collision:\n  - Snake body segments: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3).\n  - (3,6) is not in these, so no collision.\n- Food at (3,6)? No.\n- Safe move.\n\n**2. Move Left (L) to (2,5):**\n- Check walls:\n  - x=0 is a wall, (2,5) is not a wall.\n  - Internal walls: (2,5) is not in the list.\n- Check body collision:\n  - (2,5) is not in snake body.\n- Food at (2,5)? No.\n- Safe move.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (4,5):**\n- Check walls:\n  - x=7 is a wall, (4,5) is not a wall.\n  - Internal walls: (4,5) is not in the list.\n- Check body collision:\n  - (4,5) is not in snake body.\n- Food at (4,5)? No.\n- Safe move.\n\nAll three possible moves are safe in terms of not hitting walls or body. Now, let's consider food and potential future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Food:\n\n**Food at (3,2): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten now).**\n- Currently under snake's body at (3,3).\n- To eat it:\n  - Body must move away from (3,3), and head must move to (3,2).\n  - Current body: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)].\n  - If we move U to (3,6), body becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] — (3,3) is still occupied by body, so cannot eat (3,2).\n  - If we move L to (2,5), body becomes [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] — (3,3) still occupied.\n  - If we move R to (4,5), body becomes [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] — (3,3) still occupied.\n  \nCannot eat (3,2) this turn because it's under the body and no move frees up (3,3) to allow head to reach (3,2) next turn.\n\n**Food at (1,1): value=1, life_span=6.**\n- Not adjacent to head now, can consider moving towards it in future turns.\n\n**Food at (2,3): value=1, life_span=9.**\n- Adjacent to body segment (3,3) and (4,3).\n- Currently at (2,3), which is adjacent to (3,3) (body) and (2,4) is a wall.\n- To eat (2,3), head needs to move to (2,3).\n  - From (3,5), possible paths:\n    - Left to (2,5), then Down to (2,4) — but (2,4) is a wall.\n    - Left to (2,5), then Left to (1,5), then Down... seems long.\n  - Not immediately reachable in a safe manner.\n\n### Considering Future Moves:\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, let's choose a move that keeps options open for future food collection and avoids getting trapped.\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,6):\n  - Next turn from (3,6), possible moves: U (to (3,7) which is wall), L (to (2,6)), R (to (4,6)).\n  - U is invalid (wall), so would have to choose L or R.\n  \n- Moving Left (L) to (2,5):\n  - Next turn from (2,5), possible moves: U (to (2,6)), L (to (1,5)), D (to (2,4) which is wall).\n  - Current direction would be L, so can't go R (opposite).\n  \n- Moving Right (R) to (4,5):\n  - Next turn from (4,5), possible moves: U (to (4,6)), R (to (5,5)), D (to (4,4) which is wall).\n  - Current direction would be R, can't go L.\n\nMoving Left seems better because:\n- From (2,5), can go U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n- From (1,5), can go down towards (1,1) food later.\n  \nMoving Right to (4,5) is also safe but may lead towards the internal wall at (6,3) eventually.\n\nMoving Up to (3,6) is safe but limits next moves to L or R.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger:\n\nNo food is adjacent to the tail currently (tail is at (4,3)), so no immediate danger from that rule.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven that we can't eat any food this turn and want to keep future options open, moving Left (L) to (2,5) seems like a good choice as it allows us to potentially move towards the (1,1) food in future turns.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 21 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6).\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n   - Positions (head first): [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n     - Head at (2,5), next segment at (3,5), then (3,4), tail at (3,3).\n   - Current direction: L (Left). This means the snake was moving left to reach (2,5) from (3,5).\n\n**3. Food:**\n   - Two pieces:\n     1. (1,1): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     2. (2,3): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (2,5), possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (2,6) — but y=7 is a wall, so y=6 is valid.\n- Down (D): (2,4)\n- Left (L): (1,5)\n- Right (R): (3,5)\n\nBut we have movement constraints:\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is L, so cannot move R (right) next.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n**1. Up (U) to (2,6):**\n   - Check for walls: (2,6) is not listed as a wall (border is y=7).\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). (2,6) is not in these.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food at (2,6)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n**2. Down (D) to (2,4):**\n   - Check walls: (2,4) is an internal obstacle (listed as (2,4)).\n   - Cannot move here; it's a wall.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n**3. Left (L) to (1,5):**\n   - Check walls: x=0 is border, x=1 is valid.\n   - Check body: (1,5) not in body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food at (1,5)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\nWait, the food is at (1,1) and (2,3). Neither is reachable in one move from (2,5).\n\nBut let's think about the food:\n\n- (1,1): value 6, life_span 1. After this turn, it disappears (since life_span decreases by 1 to 0).\n- (2,3): value 8, life_span 1. Similarly, disappears after this turn.\n\nNeither is adjacent to the head at (2,5), so we can't eat any food this turn regardless of move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\nTail is at (3,3). Adjacent cells to head (2,5):\n- (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6)\n\n(3,3) is not adjacent to (2,5) (distance is sqrt((3-2)^2 + (3-5)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) > 1).\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom above, valid moves are U and L.\n\n**Move U (Up):**\n- New head: (2,6)\n- Body follows: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n- Tail (3,3) moves to (3,4), but (3,4) is now the third segment, so tail is at (3,4).\n- No food eaten.\n\n**Move L (Left):**\n- New head: (1,5)\n- Body follows: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n- Tail (3,3) moves to (3,4), so tail is at (3,4).\n- No food eaten.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nNeither leads to food, so we want to position ourselves for future food or avoid getting trapped.\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (1,1) and (2,3) will disappear after this turn, so next turn no food unless new appears.\n- Current snake length is 4 (positions list has 4 segments).\n\nAfter move U:\n- Head at (2,6), body at (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n- From (2,6), possible next moves: U (to y=7 which is wall, invalid), D (to (2,5) - body, collision), L (to (1,6)), R (to (3,6))\n   - L to (1,6): check walls - no, but y=6 is ok, x=1 is ok.\n   - R to (3,6): check walls - no, y=6 ok, x=3 ok.\n   - But current direction would be U, so can't do D next turn (no reverse), but D is invalid anyway.\n\nAfter move L:\n- Head at (1,5), body at (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n- From (1,5), possible next moves: U (to (1,6)), D (to (1,4)), L (to (0,5) - wall), R (to (2,5) - body)\n   - U to (1,6): ok\n   - D to (1,4): wall (internal obstacle at (1,4))\n   - So only U is valid next if move L now.\n\nMove U seems better because next turn we have two options (L or R), whereas move L leaves only U next turn.\n\n### Checking for Future Food Access\n\nNo food will be present next turn, but generally, having more options is better to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and L, U provides more flexibility for the next move. \n\n**Action: U**\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 22\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and anything on these borders is a wall).\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (2,6)\n- Body segments in order: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** U (Up, which means it was moving upwards in the previous move)\n\n**Food Items:**\n1. (1,1): value = 5, life_span = 1\n2. (2,3): value = 7, life_span = 1\n3. (5,4): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the grid based on the given information.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (2,6)\n  - Body at (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n  \n- Walls:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n- Food:\n  - (1,1), (2,3), (5,4)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is U, the snake cannot instantly reverse to D (No instant reverse rule).\n\nSo, possible moves from current direction U are: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Up (U):** (2,6) → (2,7)\n   - (2,7): Check if it's a wall or body.\n     - y=7 is a border wall → collision → deadly.\n   - **Result:** Death. Not viable.\n\n2. **Move Left (L):** (2,6) → (1,6)\n   - (1,6): Check walls or body.\n     - Walls: Not a border wall (x=1 is not 0 or 7, y=6 is not 0 or 7).\n     - Internal obstacles: (1,4) is at y=4, not y=6 → no obstacle here.\n     - Body segments: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4) → none at (1,6).\n   - **Result:** Safe move.\n   - Now, check if there's food at (1,6): No, food is at (1,1), (2,3), (5,4).\n   - So, just a safe move with no food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R):** (2,6) → (3,6)\n   - (3,6): Check walls or body.\n     - Walls: Not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not listed as an obstacle.\n     - Body segments: (3,5), (3,4) → none at (3,6).\n   - **Result:** Safe move.\n   - Check food: No food at (3,6).\n   - Just a safe move with no food.\n\n### Comparing L and R\n\nBoth L and R are safe moves without immediate food. Now, let's think about future possibilities after each move to decide which is better.\n\n**After Move L to (1,6):**\n- New head at (1,6), direction L.\n- Next possible moves: L (can't reverse to R), U, D.\n  - L: (0,6) → x=0 is wall → death.\n  - U: (1,7) → y=7 is wall → death.\n  - D: (1,5)\n    - Check (1,5):\n      - Walls: Not a border, internal obstacles: (1,4) is below (1,5) is safe.\n      - Body: Current body is (2,6) is now tail, (2,5), (3,5), (3,4).\n        - After moving to (1,6), body becomes [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)], tail (3,4) is removed.\n        - So (1,5) is not in body.\n      - Safe.\n    - Then from (1,5), can move to (1,4) but (1,4) is an obstacle → can't.\n    - Other moves from (1,5): L (0,5) wall, D (1,4) obstacle, R (2,5) is body (from [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]).\n      - R to (2,5) is body → death.\n    - So from (1,5), only safe move is D to (1,4) but it's an obstacle → dead end.\n- So moving L now leads to a dead end soon.\n\n**After Move R to (3,6):**\n- New head at (3,6), direction R.\n- Next possible moves: R (can't reverse to L), U, D.\n  - R: (4,6)\n    - Check (4,6):\n      - Walls: Not border, internal obstacles: (4,4) is below, not at (4,6).\n      - Body: After moving to (3,6), body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)], tail (3,4) removed.\n        - (4,6) not in body.\n      - Safe.\n    - From (4,6), can explore further.\n  - U: (3,7) → y=7 wall → death.\n  - D: (3,5)\n    - (3,5) is in body (from [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]) → death.\n- So from (3,6), safe moves are R to (4,6) or U/D which are deadly.\n  - R to (4,6) seems better.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n- Possible moves: R (can't reverse to L), U, D.\n  - R: (5,6)\n    - (5,6) is an internal obstacle → death.\n  - U: (4,7) → wall → death.\n  - D: (4,5)\n    - Check (4,5):\n      - Walls: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) is safe.\n      - Body: current is [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)], tail (3,5) removed.\n        - (4,5) not in body.\n      - Safe.\n    - From (4,5), can move to (4,4) but it's an obstacle → can't.\n      - Other moves: L (3,5) is body, R (5,5) is safe, D (4,4) obstacle.\n        - R to (5,5):\n          - Check (5,5):\n            - Walls: (5,6) is obstacle but (5,5) is safe.\n            - Body: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)], tail (2,5) removed.\n              - (5,5) not in body.\n            - Safe.\n          - Food at (5,4) is below (5,5), could be reachable in future.\n- So moving R now seems to keep more options open compared to L.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nAll food has life_span = 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So none of the food will be available next turn. Therefore, we can't reach any food this turn because:\n\n- Current head at (2,6).\n- Possible moves: L to (1,6), R to (3,6).\n  - Distance to foods:\n    - (1,1): Manhattan distance from (2,6) is |2-1| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6 → can't reach in 1 move.\n    - (2,3): |2-2| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3 → can't reach in 1 move.\n    - (5,4): |2-5| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5 → can't reach in 1 move.\n  \nSo no food is reachable this turn regardless of move.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nFrom earlier, moving L leads to a quicker dead end than moving R. Moving R keeps more options open for future moves.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if moving to a cell adjacent to tail where tail has positive food could be dangerous. But tail is at (3,4), and foods are at (1,1), (2,3), (5,4). (3,4) doesn't have food, so no danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween L and R, R is better because:\n- Both don't lead to immediate food (none reachable this turn).\n- Moving R keeps more future paths open; moving L leads to a quicker dead end.\n\n**Action:** \\boxed{R}",

Current body positions are (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) → No.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (3,5)**:\n   - Currently the tail is at (3,5). \n   - Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward, but we need to check if the tail has food that would cause a collision after growth.\n   - The tail is at (3,5). Is there food at (3,5)? Looking at food positions: (1,1), (2,3), (5,4) → No.\n   - So, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away, and no food is there to cause growth and collision.\n   - However, the current direction is R, and D is not opposite, so it's allowed.\n\n3. **Up (U) to (3,7)**:\n   - y=7 is a border wall → invalid.\n\n4. **Left (L) to (2,6)**:\n   - Occupied by the body → invalid (unless it's the tail with no food, but here it's the body, not the tail).\n\nSo, possible valid moves: R or D.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Right (R) to (4,6)**\n- New head position: (4,6).\n- Is there food at (4,6)? No.\n- Snake will move, tail will move away from (3,5), length remains the same.\n- Safe move, no immediate risks.\n\n**Option 2: Down (D) to (3,5)**\n- New head position: (3,5) (current tail).\n- Tail is at (3,5), which will move away (original tail is at (3,5), body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)], so after move, tail moves from (3,5) to where? Original body is [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)], after head moves to (3,5), new body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)], tail is (2,5).\n- Is there food at (3,5)? No.\n- So, length remains the same, no collision.\n- However, moving D from R is allowed (not opposite), but is it beneficial?\n- After D, next moves from (3,5):\n  - Current direction would be D.\n  - Possible next moves: L to (2,5) (body), R to (4,5), D to (3,4), U to (3,6) (but opposite to D, so invalid unless no other options).\n  - (4,5): check walls/obstacles: x=4,y=5 is not a wall or obstacle.\n  - (3,4): not a wall or obstacle.\n  - So, future options seem okay, but no immediate benefit over R.\n\n**Comparing R and D**:\n- Both are safe.\n- R moves towards the center, possibly opening more options.\n- D moves towards the lower part where there's food at (2,3) and (5,4), but not directly towards them.\n- No immediate food to gain in either move.\n\n**Potential Food Considerations**:\n- Closest food:\n  - (2,3): distance from head (3,6) is |3-2| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n  - (5,4): |3-5| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n  - (1,1): |3-1| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7.\n- Moving R to (4,6) doesn't directly help reach food.\n- Moving D to (3,5) is slightly closer to (2,3) and (5,4), but not directly.\n\n**Safety Check**:\n- After R to (4,6), next moves could be R to (5,6) (but (5,6) is an internal obstacle), so would have to go D to (4,5) or U to (4,7) (wall), so only D.\n- After D to (3,5), as discussed, next moves could be R or D.\n\nNeither move is clearly better, but R seems slightly safer as it moves away from walls and obstacles.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there food adjacent to the head that can be eaten now?\n- Adjacent cells to head (3,6):\n  - U (3,7): wall.\n  - D (3,5): no food.\n  - L (2,6): no food (body is there).\n  - R (4,6): no food.\nSo, no immediate food to eat in one move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food under the tail?\n- Tail is at (3,5).\n- Adjacent to head (3,6): D to (3,5) is tail.\n- Is there food at (3,5)? No.\nSo, no danger of tail reward collision.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth R and D are safe, with no immediate food to gain. R seems slightly better as it moves towards the center, potentially opening more options in the future.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). So the body segments are at (3,6), (2,6), and tail at (2,5).\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1,1): value=3, life_span=1.\n   - (2,3): value=5, life_span=1.\n   - (5,4): value=8, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,6) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4,7) — but y=7 is a border wall, so this is invalid (collision).\n- **Down (D)**: (4,5) — let's check if this is safe.\n- **Left (L)**: (3,6) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so moving left would cause a collision with the body.\n- **Right (R)**: (5,6) — but (5,6) is an internal obstacle (wall), so invalid.\n\nSo, from the current direction (R), the only immediately possible move is **Down (D)** to (4,5).\n\nBut let's verify if we can continue in the current direction or if we must turn. Since moving right is into a wall, we can't continue straight; we must turn. The only valid turn is down.\n\n### Checking Down (D) to (4,5)\n\n- Is (4,5) safe?\n  - Not a wall: Check walls — not listed as a wall.\n  - Not a body segment: Current body is at (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). (4,5) is not in this list.\n  - Is there food here? Food is at (1,1), (2,3), (5,4). No food at (4,5).\n  \nSo, moving down is safe and doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Are There Better Options?\n\nIs there any food we can reach safely? Let's see:\n\n1. (1,1): Too far, life_span=1, probably not reachable in one move.\n2. (2,3): From (4,6), to reach (2,3) would require multiple moves, life_span=1, probably won't last.\n3. (5,4): From (4,6), to reach (5,4) would require moving right then down, but right is blocked by wall at (5,6). Not reachable immediately.\n\nGiven that, no food is immediately accessible in one move. So the only safe move is down.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the tail adjacent to the head with positive food on the tail?\n- Tail is at (2,5).\n- Head is at (4,6).\n- Distance: |4-2| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\nSo no danger from tail reward.\n\n### No Instant Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is R. Opposite is L. We're not moving L, so this rule isn't violated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move is **Down (D)** to (4,5).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

However, we cannot instantly reverse direction, so we cannot move Up (U).\n\n**Available Moves**:\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: (4,5) → (4,4)\n   - Check (4,4):\n     - Is it a wall? Internal obstacles include (4,4), so yes, it's a wall. Cannot move here.\n2. **Left (L)**: (4,5) → (3,5)\n   - Check (3,5):\n     - Not a wall (not in border or internal obstacles).\n     - Not part of the snake's body (body is at (4,6),(3,6),(2,6)).\n     - Safe move.\n3. **Right (R)**: (4,5) → (5,5)\n   - Check (5,5):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n     - Safe move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go for in the next move.\n\n1. **Food at (1,1)**:\n   - Far away, not immediately reachable.\n   - Life_span=1, will disappear next turn, so not relevant.\n2. **Food at (2,3)**:\n   - Below the snake's body, not adjacent to head.\n   - Life_span=1, will disappear.\n3. **Food at (5,4)**:\n   - At (5,4), which is to the right and slightly below the head.\n   - To reach it, we'd need to move right to (5,5) first, then possibly down to (5,4), but that's two moves away.\n   - Life_span=1, will disappear next turn, so not reachable in time.\n4. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - At (2,5), which is two cells to the left of the head (current head at (4,5)).\n   - Can we reach it in one move? No, need to move left to (3,5), then left again to (2,5).\n   - Life_span=1, will disappear next turn, so not reachable in time.\n\n**Conclusion**: None of the food items can be eaten in the immediate next move because they either are too far or will disappear before we can reach them.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (2,6).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7). (2,7) is out of bounds (y=7 is wall).\n- Head is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (2,6), so no immediate danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Next Move\n\nSince no food is immediately reachable, our priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning ourselves for future food.\n\nFrom the available safe moves:\n- Left (L) to (3,5)\n- Right (R) to (5,5)\n\nLet's evaluate both:\n\n1. **Left to (3,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,5):\n     - Current direction would be L, so cannot instantly reverse to R.\n     - Can go L to (2,5), D to (3,4), or U to (3,6).\n     - (3,6) is part of the body, so cannot go U.\n     - (2,5): is that safe?\n       - (2,5) is not a wall, not part of body (body is at (4,6),(3,6),(2,6)), but food is at (2,5) with value=10.\n       - If we go L to (3,5), then next turn L to (2,5), we can eat the food at (2,5) if it's still there.\n       - But food at (2,5) has life_span=1, so at turn 26 it will disappear. So at turn 26, it's gone, so cannot eat it.\n   - So moving left seems safe but doesn't lead to immediate food.\n\n2. **Right to (5,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (5,5):\n     - Current direction would be R, so cannot instantly reverse to L.\n     - Can go R to (6,5), D to (5,4), or U to (5,6).\n     - (5,6): is a wall (internal obstacle at (5,6)), so cannot go U.\n     - (6,5): not a wall, not part of body.\n     - (5,4): food is at (5,4) with value=7, life_span=1, so at turn 26 it disappears.\n       - So if we go R to (5,5), then D to (5,4) at turn 26, the food is gone.\n   - So moving right also seems safe but doesn't lead to immediate food.\n\nBetween left and right, both are safe, but let's see which one gives us more options in the future.\n\n- Moving left to (3,5):\n  - Next turn, can go L to (2,5) (food gone), D to (3,4), or U is blocked by body.\n  - (3,4): not a wall, not body.\n  \n- Moving right to (5,5):\n  - Next turn, can go R to (6,5), D to (5,4) (food gone).\n  - (6,5): not a wall, not body.\n\nBoth seem equally safe with no immediate advantage. Since the snake is currently moving Down, and we cannot go Down (into a wall), and cannot go Up (reverse), left and right are the only options.\n\nGiven that, and since both are equally safe with no immediate food benefit, we can choose either. Sometimes, it's good to keep moving in a direction that opens up more space.\n\nLooking at the grid, moving right seems to open up more space towards the right side where there are fewer walls compared to the left where the body is more concentrated.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both options, moving **Right (R)** seems slightly better as it moves the snake towards a less congested area of the grid.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Yes, (5,4) has food with value=6.\n     - Check if eating is safe:\n       - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so new tail is where the current tail is (3,6).\n       - The new head is at (5,4), and the new segment is added where the head was (5,5).\n       - Will the head collide with the new tail?

No food at (6,5).\n     - Moving Right is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (Down and Right), let's see which is better:\n\n- **Down (D) to (5,4):**\n  - Eats food with value=6.\n  - Life span is 1, so it disappears next turn if not eaten now.\n  \n- **Right (R) to (6,5):**\n  - No food, just moves safely.\n\nOther foods:\n- (1,1): Too far, life span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n- (2,3): Life span=3, can consider later.\n- (2,5): Life span=9, can consider later.\n\n### Immediate Best Action\n\nEating the food at (5,4) gives the highest immediate reward (value=6) and is safe. The other foods are either too far or have longer life spans, so we can prioritize them later.\n\n### Checking for Instant Reverse\n\nCurrent head direction is Right (R). Last move was from (4,5) to (5,5), so previous direction was Right (no instant reverse issue here). Moving Down is not opposite to Right, so it's allowed.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to eat the high-value food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 27  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are in order after the head: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis means the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,3): value = 3, life_span = 1\n2. (2,5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4), the possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is D (Down), we cannot move U (Up) next.\n  \nSo, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (5,3)\n- New head position: (5,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at the bottom, so y=3 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — (5,3) is not in this list.\n  - Body collision: \n    - Current body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)\n    - After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new body will be: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)] — (3,6) is no longer part of the body.\n    - (5,3) is not in the new body segments, so no collision.\n- Food at (5,3)? No, food is at (2,3) and (2,5).\n  \nSo, moving D is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4,4)\n- New head position: (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left, so x=4 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is an obstacle! So, moving here would collide with an obstacle — deadly.\n  \nSo, moving L is not safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is right, so x=6 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (6,4) is not.\n  - Body collision:\n    - New body: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)] — (6,4) is not in this list.\n- Food at (6,4)? No, food is at (2,3) and (2,5).\n  \nSo, moving R is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, the foods are:\n1. (2,3): value = 3, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n2. (2,5): value = 8, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n\nOur current head is at (5,4). Let's see how to reach either food:\n\n- To reach (2,3):\n  - Need to move left and down.\n  - From (5,4), immediate left to (4,4) is blocked by an obstacle.\n  - So, cannot reach (2,3) in one move, and it will disappear after this turn anyway.\n\n- To reach (2,5):\n  - From (5,4), need to move left and up.\n  - Immediate left to (4,4) is blocked.\n  - So, cannot reach (2,5) in one move, and it will disappear after this turn anyway.\n\nThus, neither food is reachable in this turn, and both will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Checking for Food Under the Snake's Body\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLet's check if any food is under the snake's body:\n- Snake body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)\n- Foods: (2,3), (2,5)\n  - (2,5): is (2,5) under the snake's body? No, the body is at (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n  - (2,3): similarly, no.\n  \nSo, no food is under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food. Eating it would grow the snake, making the new tail collide with the head.\n\nOur tail is at (3,6). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (3,5), (3,7) — y=7 is a wall\n- (2,6), (4,6)\n  \nHead is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (3,6). So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nFrom the possible safe moves:\n- D to (5,3): safe, no food\n- R to (6,4): safe, no food\n\nBoth moves are safe but don't lead to food. Since both foods will disappear after this turn, we don't have to worry about them.\n\nNow, which move is better strategically? \n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving D to (5,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,3): can't reverse to U, so D, L, R.\n  - D to (5,2): \n    - Check walls: y=0 is at y=0, so y=2 is safe.\n    - Obstacles: none at (5,2)\n    - Body: would be [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] — (5,2) not in body.\n    - Safe.\n  - L to (4,3):\n    - Obstacles: none at (4,3)\n    - Body: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] — (4,3) not in body.\n    - Safe.\n  - R to (6,3):\n    - Obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle — deadly.\n    - So, R is not safe next move.\n  \n- Moving R to (6,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,4): can't reverse to L, so U, D, R.\n  - U to (6,5):\n    - Obstacles: none at (6,5)\n    - Body: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] — (6,5) not in body.\n    - Safe.\n  - D to (6,3):\n    - Obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle — deadly.\n  - R to (7,4):\n    - Walls: x=7 is a wall — deadly.\n  \nSo, moving R now leaves only U as a safe move next turn, while moving D leaves D and L as safe moves next turn. \n\nMoving D seems to give more options next turn, so it might be better for future flexibility.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween D and R, both are safe now, but D offers more safe options next turn. \n\n**Action**: D\n\n\\boxed{D}",

This means the last move was Down, so the snake cannot move Up (U) next (no instant reverse).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (2,3): value=1, life_span=2.\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - (1,3): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (5,3), moving Down (D), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (4,3).\n- **Right (R)**: (6,3).\n- **Down (D)**: (5,2). \n\nCannot move Up (U) because it's the reverse of current direction (D).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (4,3):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall (not in the internal obstacles list, and not a border wall).\n  - Body: Snake body is at [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]. (4,3) is not in this list.\n- Food at (4,3)? No food listed there.\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R) to (6,3):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (6,3) is an internal obstacle! So this is a wall, cannot move here.\n- Invalid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,2):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=2 is not a border wall, and (5,2) is not an internal obstacle.\n  - Body: Snake body is at [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]. (5,2) is not in this list.\n- Food at (5,2)? No food listed there.\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\nCurrent food positions:\n1. (2,3): value=1, life_span=2.\n   - Distance from head (5,3): |5-2| + |3-3| = 3.\n   - To reach it, need to move left 3 steps. Current move left to (4,3) is a step towards it.\n2. (2,5): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - Distance: |5-2| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n   - Currently moving down, away from it.\n3. (1,3): value=1, life_span=10.\n   - Distance: |5-1| + |3-3| = 4.\n   - Moving left would also approach this.\n\nFood at (2,3) has a life_span of 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns (including this one). So it's urgent to get it if possible.\n\n### Potential Path to (2,3):\n\nFrom (5,3):\n1. Move Left to (4,3).\n   - Next turn, from (4,3), cannot move right (reverse), can move left to (3,3) or down/up.\n   - Move left to (3,3).\n   - Then left to (2,3) to eat.\nBut this would take 3 moves, and the food disappears after 2 turns (including this one), so we can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, other foods are too far to reach immediately.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is under the tail that could be dangerous:\nTail is at (4,6). Is there food at (4,6)? No.\nOther body segments: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) - no food there.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth Left (to (4,3)) and Down (to (5,2)) are safe moves with no immediate reward. \n\n- Moving Left is towards the food at (2,3) and (1,3), but (2,3) will disappear before we can reach it. (1,3) is further but has longer life.\n- Moving Down is away from current foods but keeps options open.\n\nGiven that moving Left is towards potential future food and is safe, it seems slightly better than Down, which doesn't contribute to food collection.\n\n### Final Action\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 29  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) except where internal obstacles are)\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]  \nThis means:\n- Head: (4,3)\n- Body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) (tail)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nSo, the snake was moving left to reach (4,3) from (5,3).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,3): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (2,5): value=6, life_span=1\n3. (1,3): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,3), moving Left (L) was the last move. The possible moves now are:\n- **Left (L)**: (3,3)\n- **Up (U)**: (4,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,2)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that would be the opposite of the last move (L), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's check each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (3,3)\n- Check for walls: (3,3) is not a wall (no internal obstacles or borders at this point).\n- Check for body collision: \n  - Snake body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n  - (3,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (3,3)? No, so no immediate reward.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,4)\n- Check for walls: \n  - Internal obstacle at (4,4) → cannot move here.\n  \nThis move is invalid due to the wall.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,2)\n- Check for walls: \n  - y=0 is a border, but (4,2) is y=2, which is safe.\n  - No internal obstacles at (4,2).\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (4,2) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (4,2)? No food listed there.\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next moves or if there's a strategy to get food safely.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n1. (2,3): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Currently at (4,3), to reach (2,3):\n     - Need to move Left twice: (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3)\n     - But life_span is 1, so after this turn, it disappears. Cannot reach it in one move from (4,3).\n2. (2,5): value=6, life_span=1\n   - From (4,3), to reach (2,5):\n     - Need to go up and left: e.g., (4,3) → (4,4) [but (4,4) is a wall], or (4,3) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) → (2,5) (too many steps, food will disappear).\n   - Cannot reach in time.\n3. (1,3): value=9, life_span=1\n   - From (4,3), to reach (1,3):\n     - Need to move left three times: (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3)\n     - But life_span is 1, so disappears after this turn. Cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo, none of the foods can be eaten this turn because their life_span is 1, and they'll disappear after this turn, and we can't reach them in one move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail cell?\n- Tail is at (4,5).\n- Head is at (4,3). Adjacent cells to head:\n  - Left: (3,3)\n  - Right: (5,3) [but can't move right]\n  - Up: (4,4) [wall]\n  - Down: (4,2)\n- Tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to head (distance is 2 in y-direction).\n  \nSo, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Best Move\n\nSince we can't reach any food this turn, and all possible moves are safe (Left or Down), we should choose a move that keeps options open for future food collection.\n\n- Moving Left to (3,3) is safe.\n- Moving Down to (4,2) is also safe.\n\nBetween these, moving Left might position us better to reach potential future foods in the left part of the grid, but it's hard to predict. Both moves are equally safe with no immediate benefit, so either is fine. \n\nHowever, moving Down to (4,2) might be slightly better because:\n- It moves away from the current body segments which are mostly on the right side (from (5,3) to (5,5)), reducing the chance of boxing ourselves in.\n\nBut since both are safe and equivalent in terms of immediate benefits, and given that the snake was moving Left, continuing Left might be more straightforward unless there's a reason to change direction.\n\nGiven that, let's choose **Left (L)** to (3,3), as it's a safe continuation of the current direction.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest immediate action is to move Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 30 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6).\n- There are internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Current positions (head first): [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n  - Head: (3,3)\n  - Body segments: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n- Current direction: L (Left)\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Two pieces of food:\n  1. (2,5): value = 1, life_span = 6\n  2. (1,3): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,3) and moving left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (2,3)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,2)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse from Left, which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Left (L) to (2,3):**\n- Check for walls/obstacles:\n  - (2,3) is within bounds (x=2, y=3 is not a wall or obstacle).\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body segments: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n  - (2,3) is not in the body.\n- Food at (2,3)? No.\n- So, moving left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n**2. Up (U) to (3,4):**\n- Check walls/obstacles:\n  - (3,4) is within bounds.\n  - Not an obstacle (obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)).\n- Check body collision:\n  - (3,4) is not in the body.\n- Food at (3,4)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n**3. Down (D) to (3,2):**\n- Check walls/obstacles:\n  - (3,2) is within bounds.\n  - Not an obstacle.\n- Check body collision:\n  - (3,2) is not in the body.\n- Food at (3,2)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nCurrently, the two foods are at:\n1. (2,5): value = +1, life_span = 6\n   - Distance from head (3,3): |3-2| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n2. (1,3): value = +1, life_span = 8\n   - Distance from head (3,3): |3-1| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nThe food at (1,3) is closer (distance 2) compared to (2,5) (distance 3). \n\n**Path to (1,3):**\nFrom (3,3), to reach (1,3):\n- First move: Left to (2,3)\n- Next move: Left to (1,3)\n\nBut we can only decide the immediate action now. So, moving Left now would be the first step towards (1,3).\n\n**Potential Danger at (1,3):**\n- The tail is at (5,5). \n- After two moves left, the snake would be:\n  - After first left: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n  - After second left: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n  - The tail is now at (5,3).\n- Is (1,3) adjacent to the tail (5,3)? \n  - Distance: |1-5| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4\n  - Not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\n- So, no \"Tail Reward Danger\" here.\n\n**Alternative Path to (2,5):**\nFrom (3,3), to reach (2,5):\n- Possible path: Up to (3,4), then Left to (2,4), then Down to (2,5)\nBut (2,4) is an obstacle, so this path is blocked.\nAnother path: Left to (2,3), Up to (2,4) - but (2,4) is obstacle.\nSo, seems no direct path to (2,5) without hitting obstacles.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Left is the first step towards the closer food at (1,3).\n- Moving Left is safe (no walls, no body collision).\n- Other moves (Up, Down) don't lead directly towards food and are also safe but don't help in scoring.\n\nAlso, need to check if the food at (1,3) is under the snake's body currently:\n- Snake body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n- (1,3) is not under the snake's body, so can be eaten directly when head reaches there.\n\n### Final Action\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left towards the closer positive food at (1,3).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(1,3) and (5,4) differ by 4 in x and 1 in y → not adjacent.\n        - So no danger from tail.\n  \n- **Up (U)**: (2,3) → (2,4)\n  - Check validity:\n    - Walls: (2,4) is an internal obstacle → invalid.\n  \n- **Down (D)**: (2,3) → (2,2)\n  - Check validity:\n    - Walls: y=2 is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n    - Body: (2,2) is not in the snake's body.\n    - No instant reverse: Last move was left, down is not opposite.\n    - Food: No food at (2,2).\n  \n- **Right (R)**: (2,3) → (3,3)\n  - Check validity:\n    - Instant reverse: Last move was left, right is opposite → invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nFrom the above, the valid immediate moves are:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (1,3)**:\n   - Eats positive food at (1,3).\n   - Snake grows by 1: new head at (1,3), tail stays at (5,4) (since length increases by 1).\n   - No collision risks.\n   \n2. **Down (D) to (2,2)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Snake moves: new head at (2,2), tail moves from (5,4) to (5,3) (since length stays the same).\n   - No immediate risks, but no reward either.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. \n\n- **Left (L) to (1,3)**:\n  - Immediate reward: +1.\n  - No risks identified.\n  \n- **Down (D) to (2,2)**:\n  - No reward.\n  - Safe, but not optimal for scoring.\n\nBetween these, moving left to eat the food at (1,3) is the better choice as it increases the score without introducing risks.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm that eating the food at (1,3) doesn't cause a collision with the new tail:\n\n- Current tail is at (5,4).\n- After eating, the new tail will be at (5,3) (since the segment at (5,4) becomes part of the body, and the old tail at (5,4) is removed).\n- New head at (1,3), new tail at (5,3).\n- Distance between (1,3) and (5,3) is 4 in x, 0 in y → not adjacent, so no danger.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nFor completeness, let's see if other foods are reachable soon:\n\n- (2,5): Above the head at (2,3), but moving up to (2,4) is blocked by a wall.\n- (4,1): Far away at (4,1), current head at (2,3). Not immediately accessible.\n\nThus, (1,3) is the only accessible food right now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move left to eat the positive food at (1,3), increasing the score by 1 without any risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 32  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (1, 3)\n- Body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are at these coordinates in order from head to tail.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn. The \"no instant reverse\" rule means we can't move right (opposite of left) in the next move.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2, 5): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 4\n2. (4, 1): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (1, 3), possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (1, 4)\n- Down (D): (1, 2)\n- Left (L): (0, 3)\n- Right (R): (2, 3)\n\nBut:\n- Current direction is L, so we cannot move R (instant reverse is not allowed).\n- So, possible moves: U, D, L\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for collisions and food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U): (1, 4)\n- Check if (1,4) is a wall or obstacle:\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,4) is listed as an obstacle.\n  - So, moving up would hit an obstacle → deadly collision. Can't move up.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D): (1, 2)\n- Check if (1,2) is a wall or part of the snake:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (1,2) is y=2, not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: none at (1,2).\n  - Snake body: \n    - (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) — none at (1,2).\n  - So, (1,2) is safe to move to.\n  \n- Is there food at (1,2)? \n  - Current food: (2,5) and (4,1) — no, so no food here.\n  \n- So, moving down is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L): (0, 3)\n- Check if (0,3) is a wall or part of the snake:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a border wall.\n  - So, moving left would hit the wall → deadly collision. Can't move left.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R): (2, 3)\n- Normally, we can't move right because it's the opposite of left (current direction). But just to confirm:\n  - Current direction is L, next move can't be R → so R is invalid.\n\n### Available Moves After Checking\n\nFrom the above:\n- U: collision with obstacle → invalid\n- D: safe, no food\n- L: collision with wall → invalid\n- R: instant reverse → invalid\n\nOnly possible move is Down (D).\n\nBut wait, is there any other consideration? Let me think about the food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (2,5): value=1, life=4\n2. (4,1): value=1, life=9\n\nIs there a way to plan to get food in future moves? Currently, the only safe move is D to (1,2). From there, next moves could be:\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves (assuming next direction is D, unless we change):\n- Current direction would be D (since we moved D from (1,3) to (1,2)).\nSo next can't be U (instant reverse).\nPossible: D (1,1), L (0,2), R (2,2)\n\nBut our immediate concern is current turn. Only D is safe now.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food?\n\nTail is at (5,4). Head is at (1,3). Adjacent means one cell apart in x or y, not both.\nDistance: |1-5|=4, |3-4|=1 → not adjacent (must be <=1 in both x and y, and sum <=1 for adjacency in grid).\n\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly safe move is Down (D). Even though it doesn't get food immediately, it avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is Down (D), so cannot move Up (U) next.\n   - Allowed moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) - (1,1)\n\n- New head position: (1,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is a wall, but y=1 is not a border wall.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: (1,1) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n  - **Body Collision**: The snake's body is at [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]. (1,1) is not in this list.\n- **Food**: No food at (1,1).\n- **Tail Check**: The tail is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to (1,1), so no tail reward danger.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (0,2)\n\n- New head position: (0,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is a border wall.\n  - **Conclusion**: Moving left would hit the wall → deadly collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Not a valid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (2,2)\n\n- New head position: (2,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=2 is not a border wall, and (2,2) is not an internal obstacle.\n  - **Body Collision**: (2,2) is not in the snake's body [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)].\n- **Food**: \n  - No food at (2,2).\n- **Tail Check**: Tail is at (5,3), not adjacent to (2,2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next move or if we should plan to move towards food.\n\n1. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - Current head: (1,2)\n   - Distance: |2-1| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Life_span: 3 turns left (including current turn).\n   - To reach (2,5) in 3 moves:\n     - Possible path: e.g., R (to (2,2)), then U (to (2,3)), then U (to (2,4)), then U (to (2,5)) → but this takes 3 moves after current, so total 4 moves, which exceeds life_span.\n     - Alternatively, if we could go up immediately, but current direction is D, and no instant reverse, so cannot go U next.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot reach (2,5) before it disappears.\n\n2. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Current head: (1,2)\n   - Distance: |4-1| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n   - Life_span: 8 turns left.\n   - Possible to reach in future moves, but not immediately.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the current head that can be eaten in the next move?\n\n- Adjacent cells to head (1,2):\n  - Up (U): (1,3) - body segment (not food).\n  - Down (D): (1,1) - no food.\n  - Left (L): (0,2) - wall.\n  - Right (R): (2,2) - no food.\n\nNo adjacent food to eat immediately.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the tail adjacent to the head with positive food on the tail?\n\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent to head (1,2)? \n  - Distance: |5-1| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5 → not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n- So, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (D and R):\n\n1. **Move Down (D) to (1,1)**:\n   - Safe, no reward.\n   - Future options from (1,1):\n     - Can go L (to (0,1) - wall), R (to (2,1)), or D (to (1,0) - wall).\n     - Only R is safe, leading to (2,1).\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (2,2)**:\n   - Safe, no reward.\n   - Future options from (2,2):\n     - Can go U (to (2,3) - body), D (to (2,1)), L (to (1,2) - body), R (to (3,2)).\n     - Safe moves: D or R.\n\nBetween D and R, both are safe with no immediate reward. \n\nLooking ahead:\n\n- From (1,1) (after D), next move can be R to (2,1), then possibly U towards (4,1) food.\n- From (2,2) (after R), next move can be D to (2,1), then similar path.\n\nBoth paths seem similar in terms of future options. \n\nHowever, moving Right (R) to (2,2) keeps the snake more centered, which might offer more flexibility in future moves compared to moving Down to (1,1) which is closer to the bottom wall.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving Down to (1,1) brings the head closer to the bottom wall (y=0), limiting future downward moves.\n- Moving Right to (2,2) is more central.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that both moves are safe and neither leads to immediate food, moving Right (R) seems slightly better as it keeps the snake more centrally located, providing more options for future moves towards the food at (4,1).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)].\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=2.\n   - (4,1): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,2), moving right (R). From here, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (2,3).\n- **Down (D)**: (2,1).\n- **Left (L)**: (1,2).\n- **Right (R)**: (3,2).\n\nBut we cannot move opposite to the current direction immediately. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. Thus, **Left is not allowed**.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (3,2)**:\n   - Is (3,2) safe?\n     - Not a wall: Check walls and obstacles.\n       - Border walls: x=7 is far, y=0/7: y=2 is fine.\n       - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — none at (3,2).\n     - Not colliding with body:\n       - Snake body segments: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3).\n       - (3,2) is not in the body — safe.\n   - Any food at (3,2)? No.\n   - So, moving R is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,3)**:\n   - Is (2,3) safe?\n     - Not a wall: Check obstacles — none at (2,3).\n     - Body segments: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3).\n       - (2,3) is the 4th segment (from head: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ...]).\n       - Wait, counting positions: head is (2,2), next is (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3), etc.\n       - So (2,3) is the 4th segment; moving to (2,3) would collide with body — deadly.\n   - So, moving U is unsafe.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (2,1)**:\n   - Is (2,1) safe?\n     - Not a wall: y=1 is not y=0; x=2 is not a wall.\n     - Obstacles: none at (2,1).\n     - Body segments: not in [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] — safe.\n   - Any food at (2,1)? No.\n   - So, moving D is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (2,5): value=1, life=2.\n2. (4,1): value=1, life=7.\n3. (2,6): value=1, life=10.\n\nNone of the immediate moves (R to (3,2), D to (2,1)) reach food directly. \n\nBut let's see if we can plan to reach food soon.\n\n- To reach (2,5):\n  - From (2,2), need to go up.\n  - Current move could be R to (3,2), then next move U to (3,3), then L to (2,3), but (2,3) is body — risky.\n  - Or from (2,2), D to (2,1), then L to (1,1), then U to (1,2) — but (1,2) is body.\n  - Seems tricky to reach (2,5) safely soon.\n\n- To reach (4,1):\n  - From (2,2), R to (3,2), then R to (4,2), then D to (4,1).\n  - But (4,3) is body, (4,2) is safe, then (4,1) is safe.\n  - This seems possible in 3 moves.\n\n- To reach (2,6):\n  - Similar to (2,5), need to go up but path is blocked by body.\n\n### Immediate Best Move\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving U is unsafe (collision).\n- Moving R and D are safe but don't eat food immediately.\n- Planning to reach (4,1) seems feasible by first moving R to (3,2).\n\nThus, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to position (3,2), setting up to reach (4,1) in subsequent moves.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous?\n- Tail is at (4,3). Is there food at (4,3)? No.\n- So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, the safest and most strategic immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)].\n     - Head at (3,2), tail at (3,3).\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n   - Length: 6 segments.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=1.\n   - (4,1): value=6, life_span=1.\n   - (2,6): value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,2) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,1)\n- **Left (L)**: (2,2)\n- **Right (R)**: (4,2)\n\nBut we cannot instantly reverse the direction. Current direction is R, so we cannot move Left (L). So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U) - (3,3)**:\n   - Current tail is at (3,3), which will move away (since the snake moves forward).\n   - After moving, the new head is at (3,3), and the tail was at (3,3), but since the snake moves, the tail moves to (2,3), so no collision.\n   - Check if (3,3) has food: No, food is at (2,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n   - Is (3,3) a wall? No.\n   - Is (3,3) part of the snake's body after moving? The body segments after moving would be [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]. So (3,3) is the head, next is (3,2), etc. No immediate collision.\n   - No food eaten, just moving.\n\n2. **Down (D) - (3,1)**:\n   - New head position: (3,1).\n   - Check walls: y=1 is not a wall unless x is border, x=3 is not border.\n   - Internal obstacles: (3,1) is not listed.\n   - Food at (3,1)? No.\n   - Body collision: Moving to (3,1), body will be [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]. (3,1) is not in the rest of the body.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Right (R) - (4,2)**:\n   - New head position: (4,2).\n   - Walls: x=4 is not a border, y=2 is not a border.\n   - Internal obstacles: (4,2) is not listed.\n   - Food at (4,2)? No.\n   - Body collision: Body will be [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]. (4,2) not in the rest.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move and safe to eat:\n\n- (2,5): value=1, life=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n  - Distance from (3,2): |3-2| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4. Can't reach in one move.\n  \n- (4,1): value=6, life=1.\n  - Distance: |3-4| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2. Can reach in two moves (e.g., R then D or D then R), but not in one.\n  \n- (2,6): value=9, life=1.\n  - Distance: |3-2| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5. Can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, no food is reachable in the immediate next move. Therefore, our priority is to move safely towards potential food in future moves.\n\n### Potential Future Moves Towards Food\n\nLet's think about moving towards the most valuable food (2,6) with value=9, even though it's not reachable now.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n- To reach (2,6), need to go left and up.\n- But left is opposite of current direction (R), so can't do that immediately.\n- Next turn could go left if we change direction now.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,1):\n- Need to go right and down.\n- Current direction is R, so can go R then D.\n\nBut since no food is reachable now, let's choose a move that keeps options open.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nLooking at the snake's body and walls:\n- Moving Up to (3,3): the body is around there, might limit future moves.\n- Moving Down to (3,1): more open space below.\n- Moving Right to (4,2): also open, but closer to wall at x=7.\n\nDown seems safer to keep space.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the tail adjacent to head with positive food?\n- Tail is at (3,3).\n- Adjacent to head (3,2): (3,3) is above, so adjacent.\n- Is there food at (3,3)? No.\nSo no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll immediate moves (U, D, R) are safe with no food to eat. Down (D) seems to open more space for future moves.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Head: (4, 1)\n  2. (3, 1)\n  3. (3, 2)\n  4. (2, 2)\n  5. (1, 2)\n  6. (1, 3)\n  7. Tail: (2, 3)\n- **Current direction**: The head is moving Right (R).\n\n#### Food:\n1. At (2, 6):\n   - Value: 7\n   - Life span: 1\n   - This is positive food since the value is positive.\n2. At (6, 5):\n   - Value: 10\n   - Life span: 1\n   - Also positive food.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (4, 1) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4, 2)\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 0)\n- **Left (L)**: (3, 1) — This is the opposite of current direction (R), so it's invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 1)\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are U, D, or R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4, 2):\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (4, 2) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n  - Body: Check if (4, 2) is in the snake's body segments.\n    - Current body segments: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)\n    - (4, 2) is not in the body, so no collision.\n- **Food**: No food at (4, 2).\n- **Safety after move**:\n  - The tail is at (2, 3), which is not adjacent to (4, 2).\n  - Next moves from (4, 2) would be possible without immediate danger.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (4, 0):\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a border wall, so (4, 0) is a wall — collision!\n- **Conclusion**: Invalid move, leads to death.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5, 1):\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (5, 1) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n  - Body: Check if (5, 1) is in the snake's body.\n    - Not present in current body segments.\n- **Food**: No food at (5, 1).\n- **Safety after move**:\n  - The tail is at (2, 3), which is not adjacent to (5, 1).\n  - Next moves from (5, 1) would be possible without immediate danger.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food:\nBoth food items have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n1. **Food at (2, 6)**:\n   - Distance from head (4, 1) to (2, 6):\n     - x distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n     - y distance: |1 - 6| = 5\n     - Total steps needed: 7 (too far to reach in one move).\n   - Cannot reach this turn.\n\n2. **Food at (6, 5)**:\n   - Distance from head (4, 1) to (6, 5):\n     - x distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n     - y distance: |1 - 5| = 4\n     - Total steps needed: 6 (too far to reach in one move).\n   - Cannot reach this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger:\nCheck if the tail has positive food that's adjacent to the head:\n- Tail is at (2, 3).\n- Adjacent cells to head (4, 1):\n  - (4±1, 1) = (3,1), (5,1)\n  - (4, 1±1) = (4,0), (4,2)\n- (2, 3) is not adjacent to (4,1), so no danger here.\n\n### Decision Between U and R:\nBoth U and R are safe moves with no immediate reward. We should choose the move that positions the snake better for future moves, possibly towards food.\n\n- **Move U to (4,2)**:\n  - Next moves could be towards the food at (6,5) by moving right and up.\n- **Move R to (5,1)**:\n  - Next moves could be up towards (5,2), etc., but food at (6,5) is still far.\n\nBetween the two, moving Up seems slightly better as it starts moving towards the upper part where one food is, but both are equally safe with no immediate advantage.\n\n### Final Decision:\nSince both U and R are safe and neither leads to immediate food, and moving Up starts moving towards the general direction of the food at (6,5), I'll choose Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the game's layout, the snake's position, and the available food.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Additional walls at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)].\n     - Head: (4,2)\n     - Next segment: (4,1)\n     - Tail: (1,3)\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake's head is moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was from (4,1) to (4,2).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - Two pieces of food:\n     - (2,6): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 6\n     - (6,5): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is \"U\", the snake cannot move \"D\" (Down) next.\n   - Allowed moves: U, L, R\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - Need to check if moving in a direction would hit a wall or obstacle.\n\n3. **Body Collision**:\n   - The snake cannot move into a cell occupied by its body, except the tail (since the tail will move forward).\n\n4. **Food Considerations**:\n   - Eating positive food increases length and score.\n   - Need to check if moving to a cell with food is safe (especially regarding tail reward danger).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each allowed move (U, L, R):\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U):\n   - Current head: (4,2)\n   - New head position: (4,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: (4,3) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n     - Body: Check if (4,3) is in snake positions except tail.\n       - Snake body: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)]\n       - (4,3) is not in the body.\n     - Food: No food at (4,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n   - Current head: (4,2)\n   - New head position: (3,2)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: (3,2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (3,2) is the 4th segment of the snake.\n       - Is (3,2) the tail? Tail is (1,3), so no.\n       - It's a body segment that's not the tail.\n     - Moving into a non-tail body segment is deadly.\n   - **Conclusion**: Deadly collision, cannot move Left.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n   - Current head: (4,2)\n   - New head position: (5,2)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: (5,2) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n     - Body: (5,2) is not in the snake's body.\n     - Food: No food at (5,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a risk:\n\n1. **Food at (2,6)**:\n   - Distance from head (4,2): |4-2| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n   - Not adjacent to head, so not immediately reachable.\n   - Life_span = 6, so it will disappear in 6 turns.\n\n2. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Distance from head (4,2): |4-6| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - Not adjacent to head, so not immediately reachable.\n   - Life_span = 9, so it will disappear in 9 turns.\n\nNeither food is adjacent to the head, so we don't need to worry about eating food this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nEven though no food is adjacent, let's check if the tail has food that could be dangerous if we move towards it in the future.\n\n- Tail is at (1,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (0,3) [wall], (2,3), (1,2) [body], (1,4) [wall].\n   - (2,3): Not a food position.\n   - So, no food adjacent to tail that could cause tail reward danger.\n\n### Optimal Move Selection\n\nFrom the safe moves:\n- Up (U): Safe, no food.\n- Right (R): Safe, no food.\n\nBoth moves are safe with no immediate benefit. We can choose either, but perhaps we can consider future paths:\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,3):\n  - Next moves could be towards the food at (6,5) by moving right and up.\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,2):\n  - Next moves could be up towards (5,3), etc., but the food at (6,5) is further right and up.\n\nMoving Up seems slightly better as it positions the snake closer to the center, giving more options in future moves.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is \"U\", so cannot move \"D\". We're choosing \"U\", which is the same direction, so it's allowed.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic move is to continue moving Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 39 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- **Border Walls:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n- **Internal Obstacles:** (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- **Positions (head first):** [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)]\n  - Head: (4,3)\n  - Body segments: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n  - Tail: (1,2)\n- **Current Direction:** U (Up, which is (x, y+1))\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n  1. (2, 6): value = 5, life_span = 1\n  2. (6, 5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (4,3) with Current Direction U:\n\nFrom direction U (Up), the snake is moving in the positive y-direction. The possible moves are U, L, R (cannot reverse to D instantly).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Move Up (U): (4,3) → (4,4)**\n- Check (4,4):\n  - Is it a wall or obstacle?\n    - Internal obstacles include (4,4) → **Cannot move here**.\n  \n**2. Move Left (L): (4,3) → (3,3)**\n- Check (3,3):\n  - Walls: Not a border wall.\n  - Obstacles: Not listed.\n  - Snake body: Check if (3,3) is in snake positions.\n    - Snake positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)] → (3,3) is not here.\n  - **Valid move**.\n  \n**3. Move Right (R): (4,3) → (5,3)**\n- Check (5,3):\n  - Walls: Not a border wall.\n  - Obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (5,3) is not listed.\n  - Snake body: (5,3) not in snake positions.\n  - **Valid move**.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: L (to (3,3)) or R (to (5,3)).\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions:\n\nWe have two food items:\n\n1. (2,6): value=5, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (4,3):\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n   \n2. (6,5): value=8, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (4,3):\n     - Manhattan distance: |6-4| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n\nBoth foods will disappear after this turn, so we need to decide if we can reach either of them this turn.\n\n**Can we reach (2,6) this turn?**\n- Current head: (4,3)\n- To reach (2,6) in one move: impossible, as we can only move one cell in one direction.\n\n**Can we reach (6,5) this turn?**\n- Current head: (4,3)\n- To reach (6,5) in one move: impossible, as we'd need to move +2 in x and +2 in y.\n\nSo, we cannot eat either food this turn directly. But we can plan to move towards them for future turns, though since their life_span is 1, they'll disappear after this turn. So, effectively, we cannot eat them.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake's Body:\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLet's check if any food is under the snake's body:\n\n- Snake body positions: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n- Food positions: (2,6), (6,5)\n  - Neither is under the snake's body.\n\nSo, no food to eat under the body.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger:\n\nThe tail is at (1,2). The head is at (4,3). They are not adjacent (Manhattan distance is |4-1| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4), so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing Between L and R:\n\nSince we cannot eat any food this turn, our goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning ourselves for potential future food.\n\n**Option L: Move to (3,3)**\n- Next possible moves from (3,3):\n  - Current direction is U, but we're moving L, so new direction is L.\n  - Next moves: L (continue left), U, D (cannot reverse to R instantly)\n  \n**Option R: Move to (5,3)**\n- Next possible moves from (5,3):\n  - Current direction is U, but we're moving R, so new direction is R.\n  - Next moves: R (continue right), U, D (cannot reverse to L instantly)\n\nLet's see which move keeps more options open:\n\n- Moving L to (3,3):\n  - Next to (3,3), possible moves:\n    - L: (2,3) - check:\n      - Not a wall or obstacle.\n      - Not in current snake body (but after moving, tail moves away from (1,2) to (3,1)? Wait, let's see new snake positions after moving L:\n        - New head: (3,3)\n        - Body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n        - Tail was (1,2), which is now gone (since length stays same unless eating food).\n      - So (2,3) is not in new body.\n      - So L is possible.\n    - U: (3,4) - check:\n      - Not a wall.\n      - Obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) is not listed.\n      - Not in new body.\n      - So U is possible.\n    - D: (3,2) - check:\n      - (3,2) is in new body (second to last segment).\n      - So cannot move D.\n  - So from (3,3), can move L or U.\n\n- Moving R to (5,3):\n  - Next to (5,3), possible moves:\n    - R: (6,3) - but (6,3) is an obstacle. Cannot move R.\n    - U: (5,4) - check:\n      - Not a wall or obstacle.\n      - Not in new body (new body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2))\n      - So U is possible.\n    - D: (5,2) - check:\n      - Not a wall or obstacle.\n      - Not in new body.\n      - So D is possible.\n  - So from (5,3), can move U or D.\n\nBetween L and R, both seem safe, but moving R to (5,3) seems slightly better because:\n- After R, we can move U or D, both of which are towards the center where more food might spawn.\n- Moving L to (3,3) limits us to L or U next, with L moving towards the left edge which has more obstacles (like (1,4), (2,4)).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger After Move:\n\nAfter moving R to (5,3), the new snake positions would be:\n- Head: (5,3)\n- Body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n  \nNext possible moves from (5,3):\n- U: (5,4)\n  - Check (5,4):\n    - Not wall or obstacle.\n    - Not in new body.\n- D: (5,2)\n  - Check (5,2):\n    - Not wall or obstacle.\n    - Not in new body.\n\nBoth are safe.\n\nAfter moving L to (3,3), new snake positions:\n- Head: (3,3)\n- Body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n  \nNext possible moves from (3,3):\n- L: (2,3)\n  - Check (2,3):\n    - Not wall or obstacle.\n    - Not in new body.\n- U: (3,4)\n  - Check (3,4):\n    - Not wall or obstacle.\n    - Not in new body.\n\nBoth are safe, but as mentioned, moving towards the left may limit future options due to obstacles.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven that both L and R are safe, but R seems to offer slightly better future movement options (away from clustered obstacles on the left), I'll choose to move R.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n- **Internal obstacles**: \n  - (5, 6)\n  - (1, 4)\n  - (4, 4)\n  - (2, 4)\n  - (6, 3)\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions (head first)**: \n  1. Head: (5, 3)\n  2. (4, 3)\n  3. (4, 2)\n  4. (4, 1)\n  5. (3, 1)\n  6. (3, 2)\n  7. Tail: (2, 2)\n- **Current direction**: R (Right, meaning the snake was moving towards increasing x-coordinate last turn).\n\n#### Food Items:\nEach food item is represented as (x, y, life_span, value).\n1. (2, 6, 4, 1) - Positive food at (2,6) with 4 turns left.\n2. (6, 5, 7, 1) - Positive food at (6,5) with 7 turns left.\n3. (5, 2, 10, 1) - Positive food at (5,2) with 10 turns left.\n\nAll food items are positive (+1 reward, snake length increases by 1).\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the snake cannot move Left (L) next.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move based on:\n1. Wall collisions.\n2. Body collisions (except the tail, which moves away).\n3. Food availability and safety (especially Tail Reward Danger).\n\n#### Current Snake Body Positions (excluding head):\n- (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2)\n\n#### Possible Moves from Head at (5,3):\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (6, 3)\n   - Check walls: (6,3) is an internal obstacle → **Collision, invalid**.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (5, 4)\n   - Check walls: \n     - Not a border wall (x=5, y=4 is within bounds).\n     - Not in internal obstacles list.\n   - Check body: \n     - (5,4) is not in [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] → No collision.\n   - Check food: \n     - No food at (5,4).\n   - **Valid move**.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (5, 2)\n   - Check walls: \n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Not in internal obstacles.\n   - Check body: \n     - (5,2) is not in the body segments listed above → No collision.\n   - Check food: \n     - There is food at (5,2) with value=1.\n     - **Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n       - Tail is at (2,2). Is (5,2) adjacent to (2,2)?\n         - Adjacent means same row or column with distance 1, or diagonal distance sqrt(2).\n         - Distance between (5,2) and (2,2) is |5-2|=3 in x, |2-2|=0 in y → Distance is 3, not adjacent.\n       - So, no Tail Reward Danger.\n   - **Valid move, can eat food**.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nWe have two valid moves: U and D.\n\n**Move Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n- No food eaten.\n- Safe, but no immediate reward.\n\n**Move Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n- Eats positive food at (5,2).\n- Snake length increases by 1.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- After eating, the new tail will be at (2,2), but since the head moves to (5,2), the new tail will be the previous head's position (5,3) extended by one, but actually, the tail moves forward based on the snake's movement. Need to clarify how the snake grows:\n  - Normally, when the snake eats, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added where the head was.\n  - So, new body: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)].\n  - Next move, the tail (2,2) would move to (3,2), but that's not directly relevant now.\n\n**Is there any risk in eating (5,2)?**\n- The food is positive, and it's not adjacent to the tail (as calculated above), so no Tail Reward Danger.\n- No other immediate risks.\n\n**Alternative Consideration**:\n- The food at (5,2) has a long lifespan (10 turns), so we don't urgently need to eat it now.\n- The food at (2,6) has only 4 turns left, but it's far away and not reachable immediately.\n- The food at (6,5) has 7 turns left, also not immediately reachable.\n\nHowever, since we have a safe move to eat food now (D), and it's generally good to eat positive food when safe, this seems like the best immediate action.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Better Options\n\nIs there a better immediate reward or strategy?\n- Moving Up (U) is safe but doesn't give points.\n- Moving Down (D) gives +1 point safely.\n- No other food is immediately accessible in one move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After D:\nAfter moving D to (5,2), next moves could be:\n- From (5,2), possible directions (assuming no reverse, but need to see previous direction).\n  - Previous direction was R to (5,3), then D to (5,2), so last move was D.\n  - Next cannot move U (reverse of D), so possible: L, R, D.\n  - But need to see the new body positions to check collisions.\n\nHowever, since we're only deciding the immediate move, this is beyond the current scope.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (5,2), as it's safe and provides a reward.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)].\n   - Current direction: Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=3.\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=6.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's plot the snake's body and the food positions to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head: (5,2)\n  - Next segments: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n  \n  Drawing this:\n  - (5,2) - Head\n  - (5,3) - Body segment below head\n  - Then it turns left to (4,3), down to (4,2), down to (4,1), left to (3,1), up to (3,2), left to (2,2).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,6): Top-left area.\n  - (6,5): Bottom-right area.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Down (D). The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but with constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Cannot move Up (opposite of current Down direction).\n   - So, cannot choose U.\n2. **Available Moves**: D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collision) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) - (5,1)\n\n- New head position: (5,1).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (5,1) is not a wall (y=1 is safe).\n  - Body: Check if (5,1) is in snake body.\n    - Snake body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2).\n    - (4,1) is part of the body, but (5,1) is not.\n    - However, the tail is at (2,2), which will move forward when the head moves, so no immediate collision.\n  - Obstacles: Check internal walls.\n    - Internal walls: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,1) is not here.\n- Food at (5,1)? No food there.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (4,2)\n\n- New head position: (4,2).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, (4,2) is safe.\n  - Body: (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body (4th segment).\n     - But, the tail is at (2,2), which will move forward when the head moves.\n     - The segment at (4,2) is not the tail; it's the 4th segment. Moving here would cause the head to collide with the body.\n     - Specifically, after moving left, the new head is at (4,2), which is currently occupied by the body. The tail is at (2,2), so the body segment at (4,2) will not be the tail moving away; instead, it's a middle segment that will still be there when the head moves in.\n     - Therefore, this is a collision.\n- Conclusion: Unsafe (collision with body).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (6,2)\n\n- New head position: (6,2).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (6,2) is safe.\n  - Body: Check if (6,2) is in snake body.\n    - Snake body positions do not include (6,2).\n  - Obstacles: (6,3) is an internal wall, but (6,2) is safe.\n- Food at (6,2)? No food there.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a risk.\n\n1. **Food at (2,6)**:\n   - Current head at (5,2). Distance is |5-2| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n2. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Also not reachable in one move.\n\nNeither food is adjacent to the head, so no immediate eating opportunity.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail position: (2,2).\nAdjacent to tail:\n- (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nHead is at (5,2), not adjacent to tail (distance is 3 in x-direction). So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Decision Between Safe Moves\n\nFrom above, safe moves are:\n- Down (D) to (5,1).\n- Right (R) to (6,2).\n\nWhich is better?\n\n1. **Down to (5,1)**:\n   - Moves towards the bottom of the grid.\n   - Next possible moves from (5,1):\n     - Current direction would be D, so cannot move U.\n     - Can move D to (5,0), but y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n     - Can move L to (4,1), but (4,1) is body (segment 5), would collide unless tail moves away.\n       - Tail is at (2,2), moving to (3,2) (since head moves to (5,1), body follows).\n       - (4,1) is currently occupied by segment 5, which would become segment 6 after move, so moving left would collide.\n     - Can move R to (6,1), which is safe (no body or walls there).\n   - So from (5,1), only safe move is R to (6,1).\n\n2. **Right to (6,2)**:\n   - Moves towards the right side.\n   - Next possible moves from (6,2):\n     - Current direction is R (since we moved right from D, but original direction was D, but after moving R, the new direction is R).\n     - Cannot move L (opposite of R).\n     - Can move R to (7,2), but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n     - Can move U to (6,3), but (6,3) is an internal wall.\n     - Can move D to (6,1), which is safe (no body or walls there).\n   - So from (6,2), only safe move is D to (6,1).\n\nBoth moves lead to a position where only one move is possible next. \n\nHowever, moving Right (R) to (6,2) brings us closer to the food at (6,5), which is positive and has a life span of 6. Current turn is 41, so it will disappear at turn 47. We might be able to reach it in future moves.\n\nMoving Down (D) to (5,1) doesn't bring us closer to any food directly.\n\nTherefore, moving Right seems slightly better as it aligns us towards the food at (6,5).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing, ensure that moving Right doesn't lead to any immediate dangers:\n- No walls or body at (6,2).\n- No food at (6,2) to cause any issues.\n- Tail is at (2,2), not adjacent to new head position (6,2).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (D and R), moving Right (R) is preferable as it positions the snake closer to the positive food at (6,5) without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)].\n   - Current head direction: Right (R).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=2.\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=5.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n- Head at (6,2), moving Right (R).\n- Next segments: (5,2), (5,3), then it goes down to (4,3), left to (4,2), down to (4,1), left to (3,1), then up to (3,2).\n\nThis seems like the snake has a convoluted shape, possibly making a few turns.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nFrom the head at (6,2), moving Right (R), the next possible directions are:\n- Cannot reverse to Left (L) immediately (no instant reverse rule).\n- So possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), or continue Right (R).\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move to (7,2).\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a border wall. So this is a wall collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (6,3).\n   - Check walls: y=3 is not a wall.\n   - Check obstacles: (6,3) is an internal obstacle → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (6,1).\n   - Check walls: y=1 is not a wall.\n   - Check obstacles: No obstacle at (6,1).\n   - Check snake body: Is (6,1) in the snake's body?\n     - Snake body segments: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2).\n     - (6,1) is not in the body.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\nSo, the only valid move from current is Down (D).\n\nBut wait, let's think if there's any food to consider in this move.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\n1. Food at (2,6):\n   - Far from current head position (6,2). Not reachable immediately.\n   \n2. Food at (6,5):\n   - Current head at (6,2). Moving Down (D) to (6,1) is away from (6,5).\n   - To reach (6,5), need to go Up, but Up is blocked by obstacle at (6,3).\n   - So cannot reach (6,5) in this move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n\nTail is at (3,2). Is there food at (3,2)?\n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (2,6) and (6,5) — no food at (3,2).\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state:\n- Only valid move is Down (D) to (6,1).\n- No immediate food to eat in this move.\n- No risk of collision or tail reward danger.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(1,2): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Down (D), which means its direction is towards decreasing y-coordinate (since y increases upwards). From the head at (6,1), moving Down would take it to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. \n\nGiven the current direction is D, the possible moves are:\n- Continue Down (D): (6,0) – wall, invalid.\n- Left (L): (5,1)\n- Right (R): (7,1) – x=7 is a wall, invalid.\n- Up (U): (6,2) – but this is the body segment immediately after the head (6,2), so moving here would cause a collision with the body, which is deadly.\n\nSo, the only valid move from the current direction is Left (L) to (5,1).\n\nBut let's check if moving Left is safe and beneficial.\n\n### Checking Left Move (L) to (5,1)\n\n- New head position: (5,1)\n- Is (5,1) a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7; y=0,7; and internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,1) is not in any of these.\n- Is (5,1) occupied by the snake's body? Let's see the body segments after the head: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). (5,1) is not in this list, so no collision.\n  \nNow, is there any food at (5,1)? Checking the food positions:\n- (2,6), (6,5), (1,2) – none at (5,1), so no food to eat here.\n\n### Are There Other Options?\n\nSince moving Down is invalid (wall), Right is invalid (wall), and Up is invalid (body collision), Left is the only possible move. \n\nBut let's think if there's any danger in moving Left to (5,1). The only danger would be if in the next turn, the snake's movement could lead to a collision or if there's some immediate danger I'm missing.\n\nOne special case is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (3,1). Adjacent cells to the tail are:\n- (3,0) – y=0 is wall\n- (3,2)\n- (2,1)\n- (4,1)\n\nOur head is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to (3,1) (distance is 3 in x-direction), so no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nEven though we're forced to move Left, let's see if any food is reachable soon or if we're missing something about food.\n\nFood at:\n1. (2,6): value=1, life=1 – will disappear next turn, so not reachable from (5,1) in one move.\n2. (6,5): value=4, life=1 – same, will disappear next turn, not reachable from (5,1) in one move.\n3. (1,2): value=10, life=1 – high value, but also disappearing next turn, not reachable from (5,1) in one move.\n\nSo, no immediate food to aim for in this move.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there any way to reach food in this move? The only move is Left to (5,1), which has no food. Other moves are invalid as checked earlier.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move is Left (L) to (5,1). \n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn 44. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)].\n     - Head is at (5,1), moving Left (L).\n     - Tail is at (4,1).\n   - Length: 8 segments.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (6,5): value=4, life_span=1.\n   - (1,2): value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,1) moving Left (L), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (4,1) — but this is the tail's current position.\n- **Up (U)**: (5,2) — occupied by the snake's body (5,2 is the 4th segment).\n- **Down (D)**: (5,0) — y=0 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (6,1) — occupied by the snake's body (6,1 is the 2nd segment).\n\nWait a minute, this seems problematic. Let me list out the adjacent cells to the head (5,1):\n\n- Left (L): (4,1) — currently tail.\n- Up (U): (5,2) — body segment.\n- Down (D): (5,0) — wall.\n- Right (R): (6,1) — body segment.\n\nThis seems like all adjacent moves are either walls or body segments except moving to the tail's position (4,1). \n\nBut according to the rules:\n- Moving into the tail's current position is allowed because the tail will move forward, freeing up that space. However, we must ensure that after growing (if we eat food), the new tail doesn't cause a collision.\n\n### Checking Food\n\nLet's see if any food is at the possible move positions:\n- (4,1): Is there food here? Checking the food positions:\n  - (6,5) and (1,2) — no, so moving to (4,1) doesn't eat food.\n  \nBut moving to (4,1) is the only possible move that doesn't immediately kill the snake (since others are walls or body parts). \n\nHowever, the snake is moving Left, so the opposite direction is Right (R). The rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is L, next move cannot be R, but R is already blocked by body, so that's fine.\n\n### Is Moving to Tail Safe?\n\nAfter moving to (4,1):\n- New head position: (4,1).\n- Tail was at (4,1), which will move forward to (4,2) (since the segment before tail is (4,2)).\n- Snake grows if it eats food, but here no food is eaten, so length remains same, tail moves.\n- New snake positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)].\n- Check for collisions: head at (4,1), body segments are the rest. Is (4,1) in the body? No, because the tail moved from (4,1) to (4,2), and (4,1) is only the head now.\n\nSo moving Left to (4,1) seems safe.\n\n### Are There Other Options?\n\nIs there any way to eat food this turn? Food is at (6,5) and (1,2). Current head is at (5,1). Distance to (6,5) is |6-5| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5. Distance to (1,2) is |1-5| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5. Both are too far to reach in one move, so no food can be eaten this turn.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nEven though we can't eat food now, moving to (4,1) might open up possibilities next turn. From (4,1), possible moves would be:\n- Left (L): (3,1) — need to check if this is valid.\n- Up (U): (4,2) — body segment (from new positions, (4,2) is the new tail).\n- Down (D): (4,0) — wall.\n- Right (R): (5,1) — body segment.\n\nSo next turn from (4,1), only Left to (3,1) would be possible unless we can eat food to grow, but no food is adjacent now.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nFood at (6,5) and (1,2) both have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn. So next turn they'll be gone. So no point planning to reach them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move this turn is Left to (4,1), the current tail position, which will move away as the snake advances. No food can be eaten this turn, and all other moves lead to immediate death (wall or body collision).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However, we cannot instantly reverse the direction, so we cannot move R (right) because the current direction is L (left). So, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (3,1)**:\n   - Check if (3,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: borders are x=0 (left is x=3, not 0), no internal walls at (3,1).\n     - Not part of snake body: snake positions are listed, (3,1) is not in the list.\n   - After moving left, the tail moves forward, so the new tail will be at (5,1) (since the current tail is at (4,2), but actually, the snake's body is a bit complex; let's see:\n     - Current body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)].\n     - Moving head to (3,1), the body becomes: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)].\n     - Tail was at (4,2), now moves away, new tail is (4,3).\n   - Is there food at (3,1)? No, only at (6,5) and (1,2).\n   - No immediate collision or danger.\n   - Safe move, but no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4,2)**:\n   - Check (4,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Is it part of the snake? Current body has (4,2) as the tail.\n     - Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves away, but we have to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n       - Here, tail is at (4,2), head is at (4,1), so adjacent (directly above).\n       - Is there food at (4,2)? No, food is at (6,5) and (1,2).\n       - So no danger from tail reward.\n     - After move:\n       - New head at (4,2), body: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), ...], tail at (5,3).\n   - No food at (4,2), so no score change.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,0)**:\n   - Check (4,0):\n     - y=0 is a border wall, so this is a wall collision.\n     - Invalid move, would kill the snake.\n   - Cannot move down.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or worth pursuing:\n\n1. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Value: 3, life_span: 1 (will disappear next turn).\n   - Current head at (4,1), distance is |6-4| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6 steps away.\n   - Cannot reach it in 1 turn, so it's not immediately eatable.\n   - Will disappear next turn, so not worth pursuing.\n\n2. **Food at (1,2)**:\n   - Value: 8, life_span: 1 (will disappear next turn).\n   - Distance: |1-4| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n   - Cannot reach in 1 turn, so not immediately eatable.\n   - Will disappear next turn, so not worth pursuing.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (L and U), neither leads to immediate food. So, we should choose a move that doesn't lead to a dead end and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (3,1):\n  - Opens up more space to the left.\n  - Next moves could be U, D, or L (not R, since current would be L).\n  \n- Moving Up (U) to (4,2):\n  - Currently, the body is convoluted; moving up might lead to more constraints later.\n  \nBetween the two, moving left seems slightly better as it moves the snake towards the center-left where there are fewer obstacles currently.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving left to (3,1):\n- New head at (3,1), body: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)].\n- Next possible moves from (3,1):\n  - U to (3,2): check (3,2) - not a wall, not in body (current body has y=1,3), safe.\n  - D to (3,0): y=0 is wall, invalid.\n  - L to (2,1): check (2,1) - not a wall, not in body, safe.\n  \nSo, moving left keeps options open.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and most reasonable immediate action is to move left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 46\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**:\nHead at (3,1), then body segments in order:\n- (3,1) - head\n- (4,1)\n- (5,1)\n- (6,1)\n- (6,2)\n- (5,2)\n- (5,3)\n- (4,3) - tail\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6,5) - value: 2, life_span: 1\n2. (1,2) - value: 7, life_span: 1\n3. (5,5) - value: 10, life_span: 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but we cannot reverse direction instantly (i.e., cannot go Right (R) since that's opposite of Left).\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Left (L) - (x-1,y)\nCurrent head: (3,1)\nMove Left: (2,1)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (2,1) a wall? Border walls are x=0,7; y=0,7. (2,1) is not a border wall.\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,1) is not in this list.\n- Is (2,1) part of the snake's body? Snake positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3). (2,1) is not in the body.\n  \nSo, moving Left is safe in terms of not hitting walls or body.\n\nIs there food at (2,1)? Food is at (6,5), (1,2), (5,5). No, so no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Up (U) - (x,y+1)\nCurrent head: (3,1)\nMove Up: (3,2)\n\nCheck:\n- Walls: (3,2) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n- Snake body: (3,2) is not in the body positions.\n  \nSafe move.\n\nFood at (3,2)? No.\n\n#### 3. Down (D) - (x,y-1)\nCurrent head: (3,1)\nMove Down: (3,0)\n\nCheck:\n- Walls: y=0 is a border wall. So (3,0) is a wall. Cannot move here.\n\nSo, Down is invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon to guide our move.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (6,5) - value 2, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn)\n2. (1,2) - value 7, life_span 1\n3. (5,5) - value 10, life_span 1\n\nAll foods have life_span 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nCurrent head at (3,1). Distance to foods:\n- (6,5): dx=3, dy=4\n- (1,2): dx=2, dy=1\n- (5,5): dx=2, dy=4\n\nNone are adjacent to the head (all require at least 2 moves to reach), so we cannot eat any food this turn. Therefore, immediate food eating is not possible, so we should plan to move towards the most valuable food that's safe to approach.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,3). Adjacent to tail are:\n- (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4)\n\nHead is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to tail (distance is dx=1, dy=2). So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Planning Next Moves\n\nSince we can't eat food this turn, let's see which move sets us up best for future food.\n\nFood values: (6,5)=2, (1,2)=7, (5,5)=10. Highest value is (5,5).\n\nPath to (5,5):\nFrom (3,1), to reach (5,5), need to go right and up.\n\nCurrent direction is Left. Possible moves: U, D, L. Down is invalid (wall), so U or L.\n\nIf we go Left to (2,1), then next moves could be towards (5,5), but that seems longer.\n\nIf we go Up to (3,2), then next move could be Right to (4,2), then Up to (4,3), etc., getting closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, (1,2) is value 7, which is higher than (6,5)'s 2. Path to (1,2): from (3,1), Left to (2,1), then Left to (1,1), then Up to (1,2). But (1,2) is life_span 1, so it'll disappear after this turn, so we can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is life_span 1, can't reach in time.\n\n(5,5) is also life_span 1, can't reach in time.\n\nWait, all foods have life_span 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn. So none are reachable in time to eat. So immediate food is not a factor; we need to move safely.\n\n### Checking for Future Paths\n\nSince all foods will disappear, we need to move to a position where we can survive longer and possibly reach future foods that may spawn.\n\nCurrent snake length is 8 (from positions list).\n\nLooking at possible moves:\n- Left to (2,1): opens up space to move up/down next.\n- Up to (3,2): moves towards center, more options.\n\nGoing Left seems to keep us near the edge, which might be riskier later. Up moves towards center, which is generally safer in Snake.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers Next Turn\n\nIf we go Left to (2,1):\nNext turn, possible moves from (2,1):\n- Current direction is Left, so can't go Right.\n- Can go Left to (1,1), but then next to wall at x=0.\n- Can go Up to (2,2) or Down to (2,0) (but y=0 is wall).\n\nNot great options.\n\nIf we go Up to (3,2):\nNext turn, current direction is Up (since we moved Up), so can't go Down.\nCan go Left to (2,2), Right to (4,2), or continue Up to (3,3).\n\nMore options, seems safer.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Up, Up seems to provide more flexibility for future moves without boxing ourselves in. Left leads towards the edge with fewer options next turn.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state to better understand the positions and possible moves.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), with borders at these edges. Additionally, there are internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n1. Head: (3, 2)\n2. (3, 1)\n3. (4, 1)\n4. (5, 1)\n5. (6, 1)\n6. (6, 2)\n7. (5, 2)\n8. Tail: (5, 3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently facing \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards to reach (3, 2) from (3, 1).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6, 5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n2. (1, 2): value = 6, life_span = 1\n3. (5, 5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\nAll food items have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (3, 2)\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 2), the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (3, 3)\n- Down (D): (3, 1) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so it's a collision unless it's the tail (which it isn't; tail is at (5, 3)).\n- Left (L): (2, 2)\n- Right (R): (4, 2)\n\nHowever, we must consider:\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: The current direction is \"U\", so the opposite direction \"D\" is not allowed unless it's safe (but here it's not because it's into the body).\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - Up (3,3): Check if (3,3) is a wall or obstacle.\n     - Border walls: y=7 is the top border, y=3 is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — none at (3,3).\n     - Also, check if (3,3) is part of the snake's body: The body segments are from (3,1) to (5,3); (3,3) is not in the list.\n     - So, Up is safe.\n   - Left (2,2):\n     - Check walls: x=0 is left border, x=2 is within bounds.\n     - Obstacles: none at (2,2).\n     - Body: not in the body segments.\n     - Safe.\n   - Right (4,2):\n     - Walls: x=7 is right border, x=4 is within bounds.\n     - Obstacles: none at (4,2).\n     - Body: not in the body segments.\n     - Safe.\n   - Down (3,1):\n     - As mentioned, it's the body segment right after the head, so collision unless it's the tail. Here, tail is at (5,3), so (3,1) is not the tail. Hence, Down leads to collision and is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see where the food is relative to possible moves:\n\n1. (6,5): value = 1\n   - Distance from head (3,2): |6-3| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n2. (1,2): value = 6\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n   - Can reach in two moves (left twice).\n   - Current move can be left to (2,2), then next move left to (1,2).\n3. (5,5): value = 9\n   - Distance: |5-3| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\nSo, the high-value foods are not immediately adjacent, but moving left can start a path towards (1,2) with value 6.\n\n### Checking Immediate Food Access\n\nAre any food items adjacent to the head (3,2)?\nAdjacent cells:\n- (3,3), (2,2), (4,2)\nLooking at food positions:\n- (6,5), (1,2), (5,5) — none are adjacent to (3,2).\n\nThus, no immediate food to eat in one move. We must choose a move that is safe and possibly leads towards food in future moves.\n\n### Potential Moves and Their Outcomes\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3,3)**:\n   - Safe as checked.\n   - Next turn, possible moves from (3,3):\n     - Current direction would be U, so can't go D.\n     - U to (3,4): check if safe.\n       - Not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Body: snake will move, so tail at (5,3) moves to (?,?), but need to see new body positions after moving U.\n       - After moving U, new body:\n         - Head: (3,3)\n         - Then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), tail was (5,3) but now moves forward to (5,2)? Wait, need to see:\n           - Original body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n           - After moving head to (3,3), the body shifts: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), and tail (5,3) is removed (since length doesn't increase unless eating food).\n           - So new body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n           - So (3,4) is not in body, safe.\n     - L to (2,3): check.\n       - Not wall or obstacle.\n       - Not in new body: safe.\n     - R to (4,3): check.\n       - Not wall or obstacle.\n       - Not in new body: safe.\n   - No immediate food, but opens paths.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,2)**:\n   - Safe.\n   - Next turn, from (2,2), possible moves:\n     - Current direction would be L, so can't go R.\n     - U to (2,3): safe?\n       - Not wall or obstacle.\n       - New body after moving L:\n         - Head: (2,2)\n         - Then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n         - So (2,3) not in body, safe.\n     - D to (2,1): \n       - Not wall or obstacle.\n       - Not in new body: safe.\n     - L to (1,2): \n       - Food at (1,2) with value 6.\n       - Check if can eat:\n         - After moving to (2,2), next move to (1,2) would be eating the food.\n         - Need to ensure that after eating, the new tail doesn't collide with head.\n         - Current tail is (5,2).\n         - After eating, length increases by 1, so new tail is the old tail (5,2) stays, and new segment is added where head was.\n         - So new body would be: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n         - Head at (1,2), next to tail at (5,2)? No, distance is large, no collision.\n         - So safe to eat.\n       - So moving left now can lead to eating high-value food next turn.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,2)**:\n   - Safe.\n   - Next turn, from (4,2), possible moves:\n     - Current direction R, can't go L.\n     - U to (4,3): safe?\n       - New body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n       - (4,3) not in body, safe.\n     - D to (4,1):\n       - (4,1) is in body (third segment), so collision unless it's tail.\n       - Current tail is (5,2), so (4,1) is not tail, collision.\n     - R to (5,2):\n       - (5,2) is in body (second last segment), not tail, so collision.\n     - So only safe move is U.\n   - Not leading to immediate food, and limits next moves.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, but doesn't lead directly to food. May explore more space.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe, and can lead to eating (1,2) with value 6 next turn.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, but limits next moves and no immediate food path.\n\n**Best choice**: Left, as it sets up to eat the high-value food next turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special case is \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,3). Adjacent to head (3,2)? Distance is |5-3| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1). So no danger here.\n\nAfter moving left to (2,2), next turn tail will be at (5,2). Distance to (1,2) is |5-1| + |2-2| = 4, not adjacent. So no danger in eating (1,2) next turn.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is U. Moving L or R is not opposite, so allowed. Moving D is opposite and into body, so not allowed.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)**, setting up to eat the high-value food at (1,2) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n- **Internal obstacles**: \n  - (5, 6)\n  - (1, 4)\n  - (4, 4)\n  - (2, 4)\n  - (6, 3)\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail:\n  1. Head: (2, 2)\n  2. (3, 2)\n  3. (3, 1)\n  4. (4, 1)\n  5. (5, 1)\n  6. (6, 1)\n  7. (6, 2)\n  8. Tail: (5, 2)\n- **Current direction**: The head is moving Left (L), meaning it was at (3,2) in the previous turn and moved to (2,2).\n\n#### Food:\n1. (1, 2): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, snake length increases by 1).\n2. (5, 5): value = 1, life_span = 8\n   - Also positive food.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2) moving Left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1,2) - but we're already moving Left, so this is continuing in the same direction.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,1)\n  \nWe cannot move Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse (opposite of current direction Left), which is not allowed.\n\n#### Checking Each Possible Move:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n   - Check if (1,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: (1,2) is not a border wall (x=0 is at x=0, not x=1), and not in internal obstacles.\n     - Not part of the snake's body except the tail:\n       - Snake body segments: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n       - (1,2) is not in this list.\n   - Food at (1,2):\n     - It's positive food with value 1.\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger:\n       - Tail is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to the head (2,2). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,2) is adjacent to (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). (5,2) is not adjacent.\n       - So no danger from tail reward.\n   - After eating:\n     - New head at (1,2), body grows by 1: new segment added where the tail was.\n     - New snake: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n     - No immediate collision with body.\n   - Seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,3)**:\n   - Check (2,3):\n     - Not a wall: not in borders or internal obstacles.\n     - Not in snake body.\n   - No food at (2,3).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (2,1)**:\n   - Check (2,1):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Snake body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are at y=1, but x=2 is not in these.\n     - So (2,1) is safe.\n   - No food at (2,1).\n   - Safe but no reward.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n  - Pros: Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1), no immediate danger.\n  - Cons: Moves towards the left border (but next move can be U/D to avoid hitting x=0 in future).\n\n- **Move Up (U) or Down (D)**:\n  - Safe but no immediate gain.\n  - Might be useful if we're avoiding something, but currently no negative food or immediate threats.\n\nGiven that eating positive food is beneficial and there's no immediate danger in doing so, **moving Left to (1,2)** seems optimal.\n\n### Verifying for Potential Dangers\n\n- After moving Left to (1,2), the new head is at (1,2), and the tail is at (5,2).\n- Next possible moves from (1,2):\n  - Left (L): (0,2) - but x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n  - Up (U): (1,3)\n  - Down (D): (1,1)\n  - Right (R): (2,2) - but this would be reverse from Left, which is not allowed.\n  - So next turn would have to choose between U or D, both safe.\n\nNo immediate future collision risks detected from this move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to eat the positive food at (1,2), as it increases the score and length without introducing immediate danger.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head at (1,2), followed by body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2).\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,5): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (4,2): value=10, life_span=1.\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but we cannot instantly reverse direction (so no Right, since that would be opposite to Left).\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (1,2).\n- New head position: (0,2).\n- Check:\n  - Is (0,2) a wall? x=0 is a border wall → collision! Deadly.\n- **Conclusion**: Can't move Left.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (1,3).\n- Check:\n  - Is (1,3) a wall? No walls listed at (1,3).\n  - Is (1,3) part of the snake's body? Let's see snake positions:\n    - (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2).\n    - (1,3) is not in this list → safe.\n  - Any food at (1,3)? No food listed there.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (1,1).\n- Check:\n  - Is (1,1) a wall? No walls listed at (1,1).\n  - Is (1,1) part of the snake's body? Not in the positions list → safe.\n  - Any food at (1,1)? No food listed there.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if moving towards them is beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (5,5)**:\n   - Value: +7, life_span: 1.\n   - Current turn: 49, so it will disappear at turn 50 if not eaten now.\n   - Distance from head (1,2):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-1| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7.\n     - Can't reach it in one move; it's too far.\n   - Even if we could, life_span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn, so we can't eat it next turn.\n   - **Conclusion**: Can't eat (5,5) this turn, and it will disappear next turn. Ignore.\n\n2. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Value: +10, life_span: 1.\n   - Disappears at turn 50 if not eaten now.\n   - Distance from head (1,2):\n     - |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n     - Can't reach in one move.\n   - **Conclusion**: Can't eat (4,2) this turn, and it will disappear next turn. Ignore.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThis is about whether the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food that could be eaten, causing a collision.\n\n- Tail position: last in snake positions → (5,2).\n- Is head adjacent to tail?\n  - Head: (1,2), tail: (5,2).\n  - Adjacent means distance of 1: |5-1| + |2-2| = 4 ≠ 1 → not adjacent.\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom possible moves:\n- Left: leads to wall collision → invalid.\n- Up: safe, no reward.\n- Down: safe, no reward.\n\nBoth Up and Down are safe with no immediate reward. Since both are equally good in terms of safety and no food is reachable this turn, we can choose either. \n\nBut let's think about future moves:\n- If we go Up to (1,3), next moves could be towards the center where more food might spawn.\n- If we go Down to (1,1), we're moving towards the bottom edge, which might limit future options.\n\nGiven that, going Up seems slightly better to keep more options open.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that we could eat by moving away and then back? \n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (5,5) and (4,2) are not under the snake's body (snake is at (1,2) to (5,2), etc., not overlapping with food positions).\nSo, no hidden food to consider.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween Up and Down, both are safe, but Up seems slightly better for future flexibility. \n\n**Action**: Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 50 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, it's an 8x8 grid (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)].\n  - Head is at (1,3).\n  - Tail is at (6,2).\n- Current direction: U (Up). This means the snake was moving upwards to reach (1,3) from (1,2).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Two food items:\n  1. (5,5): value = 6, life_span = 1.\n  2. (4,2): value = 9, life_span = 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\nFrom the current head position (1,3) and direction U, the possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (1,4)\n- L (Left): (0,3)\n- R (Right): (2,3)\n\nCannot move D (Down) because it's the opposite of the current direction U (no instant reverse).\n\n**Checking each move:**\n\n**1. Move U (Up) to (1,4):**\n- Check if (1,4) is valid:\n  - Walls: (1,4) is an internal obstacle! So, cannot move here (collision with wall).\n  \n**2. Move L (Left) to (0,3):**\n- Check if (0,3) is valid:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a border wall. So, cannot move here (collision with wall).\n  \n**3. Move R (Right) to (2,3):**\n- Check if (2,3) is valid:\n  - Walls: Not listed as a wall.\n  - Snake body: Check if (2,3) is in the snake's body positions.\n    - Current body: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)].\n    - (2,3) is not in this list. So, no body collision.\n  \n  - Food: Is there food at (2,3)? No, the foods are at (5,5) and (4,2).\n  \n  - Safe to move here.\n\n**Is there any other option?**\n- Only U, L, R are possible from current direction U.\n- U and L lead to walls, so only R is safe.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\nEven though moving R is the only safe option, let's see if we can aim for food in the next steps.\n\n**Food at (4,2):**\n- Value = 9 (positive), life_span = 1.\n- Current turn is 50, so it will disappear at turn 51.\n- To reach (4,2) from (1,3):\n  - Path: (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2).\n  - Needs 4 moves, but food disappears after 1 more turn. Can't reach it in time.\n\n**Food at (5,5):**\n- Value = 6 (positive), life_span = 1.\n- Will disappear at turn 51.\n- To reach (5,5) from (1,3):\n  - Needs many moves, can't reach in 1 turn.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\nCheck if the tail has positive food that we might accidentally eat next turn, causing collision.\n- Tail is at (6,2). Is there food at (6,2)? No, foods are at (5,5) and (4,2).\n- So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly possible safe move is R (Right) to (2,3). Other moves lead to walls.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the game.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)].\n     - Head at (2,3), next segment at (1,3), and so on, tail at (6,1).\n   - Current direction: R (Right). This means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - Two food items:\n     - (5,5): value = 5, life_span = 1.\n     - (4,2): value = 8, life_span = 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,3) and direction R, the possible next moves are U, D, L, R. However, we cannot instantly reverse the direction, so moving L (Left) is not allowed because it would reverse the current R direction.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R):\n   - New head position: (2+1, 3) = (3,3).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall (no internal wall at (3,3), and not a border wall).\n     - Body: Check if (3,3) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Current body segments (excluding head): (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n       - (3,3) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n   - Food at new head position:\n     - No food at (3,3).\n   - So, moving R is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U):\n   - New head position: (2, 3+1) = (2,4).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: \n       - Internal walls at y=4: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4).\n       - (2,4) is an internal wall, so collision.\n     - So, moving U is invalid (hits a wall).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D):\n   - New head position: (2, 3-1) = (2,2).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Check if (2,2) is in the snake's body.\n       - Body segments: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n       - (2,2) is the 4th segment (counting head as 1st).\n       - But is this a collision? Normally, moving into the cell occupied by the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward. The tail is at (6,1), so (2,2) is not the tail. It's the 4th segment, which is part of the body before the tail.\n       - So, moving into (2,2) would collide with the body segment there, which is deadly.\n     - So, moving D is invalid (collides with body).\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, moving R is the only safe move (U and D lead to collisions). However, moving R doesn't eat any food. \n\nBut let's check if there's any food that can be targeted in future moves if we move R now.\n\nAfter moving R to (3,3), next possible moves would be from (3,3). \n\nLooking at the food:\n- (5,5): value 5, life_span 1. After this turn, its life_span will be 0, so it disappears. So, we can't reach it in time.\n- (4,2): value 8, life_span 1. Similarly, it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSo, neither food can be reached in this turn or the next, as their life_span is 1 (meaning they disappear after this turn).\n\n### Checking for Food Under the Snake's Body\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLet's see if any food is under the snake's body:\n- Food positions: (5,5) and (4,2).\n- Snake body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n- (5,5): Not under the snake.\n- (4,2): Check if (4,2) is in the snake's body.\n   - Snake body segments: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n   - (4,2) is not in the body, so no food under the body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (6,1). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (6,0) - y=0 is a wall.\n- (6,2)\n- (5,1)\n- (7,1) - x=7 is a wall.\n\nHead is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (6,1), so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is R (Right), even though it doesn't eat any food. Moving U or D leads to collisions, and there's no immediate food to eat in this turn or the next due to the food's life_span.\n\nTherefore, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 52  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (3,3), followed by body segments: (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right, which is increasing x)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,5) - value: 1, life_span: 4\n2. (4,2) - value: 1, life_span: 7\n3. (2,1) - value: 1, life_span: 10\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's body to understand possible moves and collisions.\n\nSnake body segments:\n1. Head: (3,3)\n2. (2,3)\n3. (1,3)\n4. (1,2)\n5. (2,2)\n6. (3,2)\n7. (3,1)\n8. (4,1)\n9. (5,1)\n\nFrom the head at (3,3), moving Right (R) would go to (4,3). Let's see what's at (4,3): checking the snake's body and walls.\n\nBody positions don't include (4,3), and walls don't block (4,3). So moving Right is possible unless it's an instant reverse (but current direction is R, so moving R is fine).\n\nOther possible moves from (3,3):\n- Up (U): (3,4) - check walls: y=7 is border, y=4 is not a wall. Snake body doesn't have (3,4). Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) - none at (3,4). So U is possible.\n- Down (D): (3,2) - snake body has (3,2) as the 6th segment. Moving here would collide with body, so D is deadly.\n- Left (L): (2,3) - snake's second segment is here. But since the tail is at (5,1), and the segment at (2,3) is not the tail (the tail is the last segment that moves), moving left would collide with the body immediately, so L is deadly.\n\nWait, let's clarify body collision rules: \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly, except if it's the tail segment because the tail moves forward. \n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Next segment after head is (2,3). If we move left to (2,3), that's the second segment, not the tail. The tail is (5,1). So moving left would collide with the body (not the tail), so it's deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (3,2) is the 6th segment, not the tail, so deadly.\n\nSo possible safe moves from (3,3) with current direction R:\n- Continue R: (4,3)\n- U: (3,4)\n- D and L are deadly.\n\nNow, let's check if moving R or U is better based on food.\n\n### Analyzing Food Options\n\nFood positions:\n1. (5,5) - value +1, life 4\n2. (4,2) - value +1, life 7\n3. (2,1) - value +1, life 10\n\nFrom head at (3,3):\n- Distance to (5,5): Manhattan distance is |5-3| + |5-3| = 4\n- Distance to (4,2): |4-3| + |2-3| = 2\n- Distance to (2,1): |2-3| + |1-3| = 3\n\n(4,2) is closest, but let's see paths.\n\nFrom (3,3):\n- To (4,2): one move down to (3,2) - but (3,2) is body, deadly. So can't go directly. Need to go around.\nAlternative path: R to (4,3), then D to (4,2). But need to check if (4,2) is safe to eat.\n\nCheck (4,2) food:\nIs the head adjacent to the tail when eating (4,2)? Tail is at (5,1). Distance from (4,2) to (5,1) is |5-4| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2, not adjacent (adjacent is distance 1). So no tail reward danger here.\n\nBut to reach (4,2), need to go R then D. But can't plan two moves ahead, only immediate move. So current move could be R towards that path.\n\nOther food:\n(5,5): from (3,3), could go R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), then U to (5,4), then U to (5,5). But life is 4, so it'll disappear at turn 56 (current is 52), so 4 turns left. Need 4 moves to reach, so just in time if no delays.\n\n(2,1): from (3,3), need to go left, but left is deadly. So can't go directly. Maybe U to (3,4), then L to (2,4), but (2,4) is a wall. So not reachable directly.\n\nSo best options seem to be:\n1. Move R to (4,3), then possibly D to (4,2) to eat (4,2).\n2. Move R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), then U towards (5,5).\n\n(4,2) is closer, but let's see if moving R now is safe.\n\nAfter R to (4,3), next move could be D to (4,2). At that point, snake would be:\nHead at (4,2), body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\nTail is at (5,1). Distance from (4,2) to (5,1) is 2, so safe to eat.\n\nAlternatively, move U now to (3,4). Then next move could be R to (4,4), but (4,4) is a wall. Or U to (3,5), but not leading to food directly.\n\nSo moving U seems less beneficial now.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there food under the head? Head is at (3,3). Food positions: (5,5), (4,2), (2,1). None at (3,3), so no.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Body\n\nFood under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it. Let's see if any food is under body.\n\nBody positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\nFood at: (5,5), (4,2), (2,1)\n(5,1) is body, food at (5,5) - no.\n(4,1) is body, no food at (4,1).\n(3,1) is body, no food at (3,1).\n(3,2) is body, no food at (3,2).\n(2,2) is body, no food at (2,2).\n(1,2) is body, no food at (1,2).\n(1,3) is body, no food at (1,3).\n(2,3) is body, no food at (2,3).\n\nSo no food under body to consider.\n\n### Decision Between R and U\n\nFrom (3,3):\n- R to (4,3): safe, leads towards (4,2) and (5,5)\n- U to (3,4): safe, but not leading directly to food\n\nBetween these, R seems better as it can lead to eating (4,2) next or continue to (5,5).\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Right\n\nMove R to (4,3):\n- Next segment is (2,3), so body is (3,3), (2,3), etc.\n- New head at (4,3), body: (3,3), (2,3), etc.\n- Tail is at (5,1), which will move to (4,1) next turn (since the segment before tail is (4,1)).\n\nNo collisions, not hitting walls.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Right (R) to (4,3), which is safe and positions the snake to potentially eat the food at (4,2) in the next move or proceed towards (5,5).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Not reachable in one move.\n- (2,1): Currently at (4,3), would need multiple moves to reach, life_span=1, so not reachable in one move.\n\nThus, the only food we can eat this turn is at (4,2) by moving Down.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions After Move\n\nIf we move Down to (4,2):\n- New head: (4,2).\n- Body segments: (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,1).\n- New tail: since length increases by 1, the tail stays where it was before moving, but the body extends.\nWait, let's clarify snake movement after eating:\n- Normally, when snake moves without eating, tail moves forward, so last segment is removed.\n- When eating, tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the head's new position, and the body extends.\nSo after moving to (4,2) and eating:\n- New snake: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (4,1)] (length increases by 1).\nNow, check for collisions:\n- Head at (4,2), rest of body: (4,3), (3,3), etc. No overlap of head with body.\n- Also, no wall at (4,2).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (4,2), which is safe and maximizes the score.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state to better understand the positions of the snake, walls, and food.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (i.e., the edges of the grid).\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions (head first): [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)].\n- Length: 10 segments.\n- Current direction: Down (D).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,5): value = 2, life_span = 1.\n2. (2,1): value = 8, life_span = 1.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's sketch a rough map around the snake's head (4,2):\n\n- Head at (4,2), direction is Down (D), meaning it moved from (4,1) to (4,2) last turn.\n- Next segment is (4,3), then (3,3), etc.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2) (current head):\n- Up (U): (4,3) - but this is the snake's body (next segment), so collision.\n- Down (D): (4,1) - but this is the tail segment. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check if there's food there that could cause a collision after growth.\n- Left (L): (3,2) - part of the snake's body (8th segment).\n- Right (R): (5,2) - need to check if this is a wall or safe.\n\nFrom the walls:\n- (5,2) is not listed as a wall (internal walls are at (5,6), etc., and borders are x=7, etc.), so it's safe unless it's part of the snake's body, which it isn't.\n\n**Food**:\n- (5,5): value 2, life 1 - at (5,5), which is not adjacent to the head (distance is 3 in x and 3 in y, so not reachable in one move).\n- (2,1): value 8, life 1 - at (2,1). Distance from head (4,2) is 2 in x and 1 in y, so not adjacent.\n\n### Possible Moves and Their Consequences\n\nCurrent direction is D (Down). The rule says no instant reverse, so the opposite of Down is Up (U), which is already blocked by the snake's body at (4,3). So, we can consider Down, Left, or Right.\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (4,1)\n   - Current tail is at (4,1). Moving here is generally safe because the tail will move away, but we must check if there's food at (4,1) that could cause a collision after growth.\n   - From the snake's positions, (4,1) is the tail, and there's no food listed at (4,1). So, this seems safe.\n   - However, moving Down would mean the head moves to (4,1), and the tail was at (4,1), so the tail moves away (to where? The snake's body is [(4,2), (4,3), ...], so the new tail would be (3,2)).\n   - No immediate collision, but we're not moving towards any food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (3,2)\n   - (3,2) is part of the snake's body (8th segment), so this would cause a collision. Not safe.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,2)\n   - (5,2) is not a wall or part of the snake's body. Safe move.\n   - No food at (5,2), but it moves us towards (5,5) (though it's still far).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nBoth foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\n- (5,5): Distance from head (4,2) is |5-4| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4. Cannot reach in one move.\n- (2,1): Distance is |2-4| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3. Cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo, we cannot eat any food this turn. \n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n\nOur tail is at (4,1). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (3,1), (5,1), (4,0), (4,2).\nHead is at (4,2), which is adjacent to the tail. \n\nIs there positive food at the tail (4,1)? No, food is at (5,5) and (2,1). So no danger here.\n\n### Best Move\n\nSince we can't reach any food this turn, the priority is to stay alive and position ourselves for future moves.\n\n- Down (D) to (4,1): Safe, but doesn't help in reaching food.\n- Right (R) to (5,2): Safe, moves towards (5,5) (though it's disappearing next turn, but maybe future food will appear in that direction).\n\nLeft is unsafe, Up is reverse and blocked. \n\nBetween Down and Right, Right seems better as it opens more options for future moves, whereas Down is just moving into the tail without benefit.\n\n### Verifying Right (R) Move\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,2):\n- New head: (5,2).\n- New body: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), ...], tail moves away from (4,1) to (3,2).\n- Check for collisions: (5,2) is not a wall or body (current body is from (4,2) onwards).\n- Walls at x=7, so (5,2) is safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and most strategic move is Right (R), as it avoids collisions and maintains flexibility for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 55 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)].\n  - Head at (5,2), moving Right (R).\n  - Tail at (3,1).\n- Length: 10 segments.\n\n**3. Food:**\n- (5,5): value=1, life_span=1.\n- (2,1): value=7, life_span=1.\n- (4,6): value=10, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,2) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (6,2)\n- **Up (U)**: (5,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,1)\n  \nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,2):\n- Check if (6,2) is valid:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a border wall, but (6,2) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (6,3) is a wall, but (6,2) is not listed.\n  - Snake body: Check if (6,2) is in snake positions.\n    - Snake positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)].\n    - (6,2) is not in the list, so no collision.\n- Food at (6,2)? No.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,3):\n- Check (5,3):\n  - Walls: Not a border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,6) is a wall, but (5,3) is not.\n  - Snake body: Is (5,3) in snake positions?\n    - (4,3) is part of the body, but not (5,3).\n  - Food at (5,3)? No.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,1):\n- Check (5,1):\n  - Walls: y=0 is a border wall, but (5,1) is not.\n  - Internal obstacles: Not listed.\n  - Snake body: Is (5,1) in snake positions? No.\n  - Food at (5,1)? No.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move from the current head position (5,2):\n\n1. Food at (5,5):\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |5-2| = 3 (not reachable in one move).\n2. Food at (2,1):\n   - Distance: |2-5| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 (not reachable).\n3. Food at (4,6):\n   - Distance: |4-5| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5 (not reachable).\n\nNone of the food is directly adjacent to the head, so we can't eat any food this turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (3,1). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head at (5,2), tail at (3,1).\n- Distance: |5-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3.\nNot adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1), so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is reachable this turn, we want to move in a direction that:\n- Doesn't lead to immediate danger.\n- Potentially sets us up to reach food in future turns.\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (5,5): above and to the right.\n- (2,1): below and to the left.\n- (4,6): above and to the left.\n\nCurrently moving Right (R), so continuing Right to (6,2) seems safe. Then next turn, we could consider moving Up towards (5,5) or (4,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving Up to (5,3) could be a step towards (5,5) or (4,6).\n\nMoving Down to (5,1) seems less useful as it's away from most food.\n\nBetween Right and Up:\n- Right (R) to (6,2):\n  - Next moves could be U to (6,3), but (6,3) is a wall, so would have to go R to (7,2) which is a wall, or D to (6,1).\n  - Seems a bit limiting.\n- Up (U) to (5,3):\n  - Next moves could be R to (6,3) (wall), U to (5,4), or L to (4,3).\n  - (4,3) is part of the body, so would have to be U to (5,4) or R to (6,3) (wall).\n  - Still somewhat limiting but closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving Down isn't so bad:\n- Down to (5,1):\n  - Next moves could be R to (6,1), L to (4,1), or D to (5,0) (wall).\n  - (6,1) is safe, (4,1) is safe.\n  - Then can move towards (2,1) which has high value (7).\n\nGiven that (2,1) has a high value (7), moving Down to (5,1) then Left to (4,1), then Left to (3,1), then Left to (2,1) could be a path to the high-value food.\n\nBut need to ensure that by the time we reach (2,1), the food is still there (life_span=1, so disappears after this turn, meaning it's gone next turn). So can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) and (4,6) also have life_span=1, so they'll disappear next turn. So no food is reachable in time.\n\nGiven that, the immediate goal is to avoid getting stuck and position for future food spawns.\n\nMoving Right seems safe and keeps options open:\n- After (6,2), can go Up to (6,3) but that's a wall, so would go Down to (6,1).\n- Or can go Down to (5,1) now, then Right to (6,1), etc.\n\nBoth Right and Down seem safe, but Right might be slightly better as it's the current direction and doesn't immediately limit options.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest move is to continue in the current direction (Right) since no food is immediately reachable and it doesn't lead to any immediate collisions.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 56 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move to these coordinates.\n- Internal obstacles (walls): (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)].\n  - Head is at (6, 2).\n  - Tail is at (3, 2).\n- Current direction: R (right). So, the snake was moving to the right to reach (6,2) from (5,2).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Two food items:\n  - (2, 1): value = 7, life_span = 1.\n  - (4, 6): value = 9, life_span = 1.\n  \nBoth foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (6, 2), current direction is R. Possible moves are U, D, L, R, but:\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L.\n- So, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n**1. Move Right (R): (6,2) → (7,2)**\n- (7,2): x=7 is a border wall. **Collision with wall → Death.**\n- **Not viable.**\n\n**2. Move Up (U): (6,2) → (6,3)**\n- (6,3): Check if it's a wall or body.\n  - Walls: (6,3) is an internal obstacle. **Collision with wall → Death.**\n- **Not viable.**\n\n**3. Move Down (D): (6,2) → (6,1)**\n- (6,1):\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, y=7 is at y=7, so y=1 is safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: Check list — (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (6,1) not in this list.\n  - Body collision: Check snake positions. Snake is at:\n    - (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).\n    - (6,1) is not in this list. Safe.\n- **Viable move.**\n  \nNow, is there any food to consider here?\n- Food at (2,1) and (4,6). Moving to (6,1) doesn't reach any food.\n  \n**4. Move Left (L): (6,2) → (5,2)**\n- Normally, opposite direction is not allowed (current is R, so L is opposite), but let's confirm:\n  - From (5,2) to (6,2) was R, so next move cannot be L.\n- **Not allowed.**\n\nSo, only viable move is D to (6,1).\n\nBut wait, is there any other consideration? Let's think about the tail and food.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger:**\n- If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the new tail would collide with the head.\n  \nCurrent tail is at (3,2). Head is at (6,2). Distance is |6-3| + |2-2| = 3, not adjacent (adjacent means distance = 1). So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nBoth foods have life_span = 1, so they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n**Food at (2,1):**\n- Distance from head (6,2) to (2,1): |6-2| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n- Can't reach in one move.\n\n**Food at (4,6):**\n- Distance from head (6,2) to (4,6): |6-4| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n- Can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly safe move is Down (D) to (6,1). Other moves lead to death.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at turn 57. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)].\n   - Current head direction: Down (D). This means the last move was from (6,2) to (6,1).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (2,1): value=6, life_span=1.\n   - (4,6): value=8, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,1) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (6,0) → y=0 is a border wall → **invalid** (collision).\n- **Left (L)**: (5,1) → Check if this is a wall or body.\n  - Walls: Not listed as a wall.\n  - Body: Snake segments are at (6,2), (5,2), etc. (5,1) is not in the body → **valid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (7,1) → x=7 is a border wall → **invalid**.\n- **Up (U)**: (6,2) → Opposite of current direction (D). \n  - Rule: \"No instant reverse\" → cannot move opposite to current direction next turn → **invalid**.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Left (L)** to (5,1).\n\n### Checking for Food at (5,1)\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (2,1) and (4,6) are the only foods. (5,1) has no food → moving left doesn't eat anything.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to move left? Let's see:\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Is the tail adjacent to the head with positive food?\n  - Tail is at (2,2). Head is at (6,1). Distance is |6-2| + |1-2| = 4 + 1 = 5 → not adjacent.\n  - So no danger from tail food.\n\n- **Future Moves**:\n  - If we move left to (5,1), next turn we can't move right (reverse), but we can consider other moves then.\n  - The food at (2,1) is close but moving left doesn't help reach it directly. Maybe next moves can aim for it.\n\n### Evaluating Other Options\n\nWait, is there any other way to reach food? The other food is at (4,6), which is quite far. The food at (2,1) is closer but requires moving left then up or similar.\n\nGiven that the only valid move is left, and it's safe, we should take it.\n\n### Checking Immediate Food Under Snake\n\nRule says: Food can spawn under snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. Body moves away, and\n2. Head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrent food is at (2,1) and (4,6). Neither is under the snake's body (snake is at positions listed, none overlap with these foods). So no need to worry about this.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten. But we can't reach either in one move from (6,1):\n- (2,1): distance is |6-2| + |1-1| = 4 → can't reach in one move.\n- (4,6): distance is |6-4| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7 → can't reach.\n\nSo both foods will disappear next turn regardless.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move is Left (L) to (5,1). There's no immediate food to eat, and moving left doesn't cause any collisions or dangers.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

No.\n   - Next head position would be (4,1), tail moves forward, so new tail is (6,1) is removed, new segment added at head if food is eaten (none here).\n   - Not eating any food, just moving.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (5,2)**:\n   - Check (5,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Is it part of the snake body? \n       - (5,2) is the 4th segment in the current body.\n   - Moving here would mean the head collides with the body at (5,2) → deadly collision.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (5,0)**:\n   - Check (5,0):\n     - y=0 is a border wall → collision with wall.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\nSo, the only valid move is Left to (4,1).\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nAre there any foods that can be reached soon that we should consider?\n\nCurrent foods:\n1.

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 59.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)].\n     - Head at (4,1), moving Left (L).\n   - Length: 10 segments.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (2,1): value=4, life_span=1.\n   - (4,6): value=6, life_span=1.\n   - (3,1): value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent head direction is Left (L). From the rules, we cannot make an instant reverse, so we cannot move Right (R) next. Possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or continue Left (L).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (3,1)\n- New head position: (3,1).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,1) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (3,1) is in snake body positions excluding the tail (since tail moves).\n    - Current body positions (excluding head and tail if moving): (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3).\n    - (3,1) is not in the body.\n  - Tail is at (1,3), which is not adjacent to (3,1) (distance is more than 1), so no tail reward danger.\n- Food at (3,1):\n  - There is food at (3,1) with value=9.\n  - Eating it would increase length by 1 (to 11), and score by +9.\n  - Life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n- Is it safe to eat?\n  - After eating, new tail would be at the current tail position (1,3) (since length increases by 1, the tail doesn't move).\n  - Next head position after eating is (3,1), which is not adjacent to (1,3), so no immediate collision.\n  - Seems safe to eat.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,2)\n- New head position: (4,2).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (4,2) is in the snake's body (current position list: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ...).\n  - Moving to (4,2) would collide with the body segment there.\n  - This is a deadly collision.\n- **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,0)\n- New head position: (4,0).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a border wall, so (4,0) is a wall.\n  - This is a wall collision.\n- **Invalid move**.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nOnly valid move is Left (L) to (3,1), which has food with high value (9). \n\nCheck if there's any danger in eating it:\n- After eating, the snake grows to length 11.\n- New positions: head at (3,1), body follows the previous positions up to the 10th segment, and the tail stays at (1,3).\n- Next possible moves from (3,1):\n  - Current direction is Left (from (4,1) to (3,1)), so can't move Right next.\n  - Possible moves: Up, Down, Left.\n  - Need to ensure that after this move, the snake has safe moves to continue.\n\nLooking at the immediate next move:\n- From (3,1), possible moves:\n  - Left (L) to (2,1):\n    - Check (2,1): \n      - Not a wall.\n      - Not in body (current body after move: (4,1), (5,1), ..., (1,3); (2,1) is not in this list unless it's the new tail, but tail is at (1,3)).\n      - Food at (2,1) with value=4.\n      - Eating (2,1) after (3,1):\n        - New head at (2,1), tail at (1,3).\n        - Distance between (2,1) and (1,3) is |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent, so safe.\n  - Up (U) to (3,2):\n    - Check (3,2):\n      - Not a wall.\n      - Not in body (current body after move: (4,1), ..., (1,3); (3,2) is not in this list).\n      - No food here.\n  - Down (D) to (3,0):\n    - y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo after moving Left to (3,1), can safely move Left again to (2,1) to eat another food, or Up to (3,2) to explore.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any other food that's better to go for?\n- (2,1): value=4, life_span=1.\n- (4,6): value=6, life_span=1.\n  - Currently at (4,1), to reach (4,6) would require multiple moves, and life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Not reachable in one move.\n- (3,1): value=9, life_span=1.\n  - Directly reachable by moving Left.\n\nSo (3,1) is the best immediate food to target.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nMove Left (L) to (3,1) to eat the high-value food (value=9).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Here:\n\n- Moving Left allows eating positive food immediately with no apparent risks.\n- Moving Up is safe but doesn't contribute to the score.\n\nGiven that the food at (2,1) is positive and safe to eat, and it's directly in the path of the current direction, the optimal move is to continue Left to consume it.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Eating\n\nAfter eating the food at (2,1):\n\n- New head position: (2,1).\n- New tail: Normally, the tail moves forward, but since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows by 1.\n- New body: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), ..., (1,3)] (length increases by 1).\n  \nNow, check if the next move after eating would be dangerous:\n\n- From (2,1), possible next moves:\n  - Left (L) to (1,1):\n    - Check walls: x=0 is wall, (1,1) is not.\n    - Body: (3,1), etc. — (1,1) is not in body.\n    - No food at (1,1).\n  - Up (U) to (2,2):\n    - No walls or body collision.\n    - No food.\n  - Down (D) to (2,0):\n    - y=0 is wall → invalid.\n  \nNo immediate danger is seen after eating, so it's safe to proceed.\n\n### Considering the Other Food\n\nThe other food at (4,6):\n\n- Far from the current position.\n- Life_span is 5, so it will disappear in 5 turns.\n- Not immediately relevant to the current decision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all the above, the best immediate action is to move Left to eat the positive food at (2,1).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the game's configuration:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Additional walls at coordinates (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3). These are like barriers within the grid that the snake must avoid.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. The current positions are:\n     - Head: (2,1)\n     - Body: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (\"L\").\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two food items:\n     - (4,6): value = 4, life_span = 1\n     - (3,6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Both foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (\"L\"), the snake cannot immediately move Right (\"R\") in the next turn. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\n2. **Collision Checks**:\n   - Moving into a wall or the snake's own body (except the tail) is deadly.\n   - The tail is special: moving into the tail's current position is safe because the tail will move forward in the same turn, freeing up that space.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L):\n   - Current head: (2,1)\n   - New head position: (1,1)\n   - Check:\n     - Is (1,1) a wall? \n       - x=1 is not a border wall (x=0 or 7 are borders).\n       - Internal walls: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (5,6), (6,3) — none at (1,1).\n     - Is (1,1) part of the snake's body?\n       - Snake body segments: (3,1), (4,1), ..., (1,3) — (1,1) is not in the list.\n   - Safe to move Left.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U):\n   - New head position: (2,2)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: (2,2) is not a border or internal wall.\n     - Body segments: Is (2,2) in the snake's body? No.\n   - Safe to move Up.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D):\n   - New head position: (2,0)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a border wall. So (2,0) is a wall.\n   - Cannot move Down (would collide with wall).\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Left (L) or Up (U).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards food is beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Value: +4\n   - Distance from head (2,1):\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7\n   - Far away; not reachable in one move.\n\n2. **Food at (3,6)**:\n   - Value: +10\n   - Distance from head (2,1):\n     - |3-2| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n   - Also far away; not reachable in one move.\n\nSince both foods are far and will disappear after this turn (life_span=1), we cannot reach them this turn. Therefore, the immediate goal is to stay alive and position ourselves for future moves.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nWe should also consider future moves to avoid trapping ourselves:\n\n- Current head at (2,1), moving Left to (1,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (1,1):\n    - Cannot move Right (reverse of Left).\n    - Can move Up to (1,2) or Down to (1,0).\n      - (1,0): y=0 is a wall — invalid.\n      - (1,2): Check if it's safe.\n        - Not a wall.\n        - Snake body: (3,1), ..., (1,3) — (1,2) is not in the body.\n    - Or continue Left to (0,1):\n      - x=0 is a wall — invalid.\n  - So from (1,1), can move Up or Left (but Left is invalid), so only Up is possible.\n\n- Moving Up to (2,2):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,2):\n    - Cannot move Down (reverse of Up).\n    - Can move Left to (1,2), Right to (3,2), or Up to (2,3).\n      - (1,2): safe as above.\n      - (3,2): check body — (3,1), (4,1), ..., (3,3) — (3,2) is not in body.\n      - (2,3): part of body — (2,3) is the second-to-last segment; tail is at (1,3).\n        - Moving to (2,3) would collide with the body unless it's the tail.\n        - Tail is at (1,3), so (2,3) is not the tail — collision.\n    - So from (2,2), can move Left or Right.\n\nMoving Left seems slightly more restrictive for future moves (only Up next), whereas moving Up gives more options (Left or Right next). \n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n  \nCurrent tail is at (1,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- Up: (1,4) — wall.\n- Down: (1,2)\n- Left: (0,3) — wall.\n- Right: (2,3) — part of snake's body (not tail).\n\nHead is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to (1,3) (distance is |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3). So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Up\n\nBoth Left and Up are safe immediate moves. \n\n- **Left (L)**:\n  - New head: (1,1)\n  - Next move likely Up to (1,2).\n  \n- **Up (U)**:\n  - New head: (2,2)\n  - Next moves: Left to (1,2) or Right to (3,2).\n\nMoving Up seems better because it offers more flexibility in the next move (Left or Right), whereas moving Left restricts the next move to only Up.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Benefit\n\nSince we cannot reach food this turn, and both moves are safe, choosing the one with more future flexibility is optimal.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list starting with the head at (2,2) and ending with the tail at (2,3). The full body is:\n     - Head: (2,2)\n     - Body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was from (2,1) to (2,2).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (4,6): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (3,6): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements:\n\n- The head is at (2,2), moving Up (from (2,1)).\n- The tail is at (2,3), which is directly below the head's current position.\n\nThe snake's body forms a complex shape, but importantly, the segment just behind the head is at (2,1), and the tail is at (2,3).\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nGiven the current head direction is \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (2,3)\n   - But (2,3) is the tail's current position. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - \"Tail Reward Danger\" occurs if:\n     - The head is adjacent to the tail (which it is, since tail is at (2,3) and head is at (2,2)), AND\n     - The tail cell has positive food that would be eaten by moving there.\n   - Currently, there is no food at (2,3), so no danger. Moving Up is safe.\n2. **Left (L)**: (x-1,y) → (1,2)\n   - Check if (1,2) is not a wall or body:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=1 is not.\n     - Internal obstacles: (1,4) is an obstacle, but (1,2) is not listed.\n     - Body: Check if (1,2) is in snake positions. It's not.\n   - So, Left is a valid move.\n3. **Right (R)**: (x+1,y) → (3,2)\n   - Check (3,2):\n     - Not a wall (x=7 is wall, x=3 is not).\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not in snake positions: (3,1) and (3,3) are, but not (3,2).\n   - So, Right is valid.\n4. **Down (D)**: (x,y-1) → (2,1)\n   - (2,1) is the second segment of the snake's body (right after the head).\n   - Moving Down would mean the head collides with the body, which is deadly.\n   - Also, the current direction is Up, so Down is the opposite direction, which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\" rule).\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Up, Left, Right.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to decide which move might be most beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Value: 3\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Distance from head (2,2):\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n   - Path to reach it: Need at least 6 moves, but it disappears after this turn, so cannot reach it in time.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat this food; it's too far and will disappear.\n\n2. **Food at (3,6)**:\n   - Value: 9\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Distance from head (2,2):\n     - Manhattan distance: |3-2| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n   - Path to reach it: Need at least 5 moves, but it disappears after this turn, so cannot reach it in time.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat this food; it's too far and will disappear.\n\nSince both foods will disappear after this turn and are too far to reach now, the immediate goal is not to eat food but to avoid collisions and position the snake for future opportunities.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nGiven that we can't eat any food this turn, let's ensure our move doesn't lead to a dead end or immediate danger next turn.\n\nPossible moves: Up, Left, Right.\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,3)**:\n   - Current tail is at (2,3), which will move away (assuming the tail moves forward in the snake's body chain).\n   - After moving Up, the new head is at (2,3), and the tail was at (2,3), so the tail moves to the next segment, which is (3,3).\n   - Next possible moves from (2,3):\n     - Up: (2,4) - Check:\n       - (2,4) is an internal obstacle (from the list: (2,4)), so cannot move Up next turn.\n     - Left: (1,3) - Check:\n       - Not a wall or body (assuming no body there; current body is moving away).\n     - Right: (3,3) - Check:\n       - (3,3) is part of the body (from the list), but it's the current tail, which will have moved by then. Wait, no: after this move, the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (3,3), but (3,3) was already part of the body. So moving Right would collide with the body.\n   - So, moving Up now could leave us with only Left as a safe move next turn, which might be limiting.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n   - New head at (1,2).\n   - Next possible moves from (1,2):\n     - Up: (1,3) - Check:\n       - Not a wall or obstacle (except (1,4) is an obstacle, but (1,3) is not).\n       - Not in current body positions, but need to see where body moves.\n     - Left: (0,2) - x=0 is a wall, so cannot move Left.\n     - Down: (1,1) - Check:\n       - Not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Not in current body positions, but need to see where body moves.\n   - Seems like Left now opens Up and Down next turn, which is better than only Left after moving Up.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (3,2)**:\n   - New head at (3,2).\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2):\n     - Up: (3,3) - Check:\n       - (3,3) is currently part of the body (from the list), but after moving, the tail moves away. Need to see:\n         - Current tail is at (2,3), which moves to (3,3) if the head moves Right to (3,2).\n         - So (3,3) would be the new tail position, and moving Up would collide with the tail.\n     - Right: (4,2) - Check:\n       - (4,2) is part of the body (from the list), but it's moving. After moving Right, the segment at (4,2) moves to (4,3), so (4,2) is free next turn.\n     - Down: (3,1) - Check:\n       - (3,1) is part of the body (second segment), so cannot move Down.\n   - So, after Right, next turn can only move Right to (4,2), which may not be ideal.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nComparing the three options:\n\n- **Up**: Leads to a position where next turn only Left is safe (since Up is blocked by obstacle, Right collides with body). This seems restrictive.\n- **Left**: Leads to (1,2), where next turn can go Up or Down, giving more flexibility.\n- **Right**: Leads to (3,2), where next turn can only go Right, which is restrictive.\n\n**Left (L)** seems the best option as it maintains more flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger for Left Move\n\nEven though we're not eating food now, let's ensure that moving Left doesn't have any hidden dangers related to the tail:\n\n- Moving Left to (1,2):\n  - The tail is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (1,2) (adjacent means same x or y with difference of 1; here x differs by 1 and y by 1, so not adjacent).\n  - So, no Tail Reward Danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most flexible move is **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)].\n   - Current head direction: Left (L).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (4,6): value=2, life_span=1.\n   - (3,6): value=8, life_span=1.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position to better understand possible moves:\n\n- Head at (1,2).\n- Body segments follow: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (3,3).\n  \nThe snake is quite long (length 12), and its body forms a complex shape. \n\nFood positions:\n- (4,6): Positive food (value=2).\n- (3,6): Positive food (value=8).\n\nBoth foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent head direction is Left (L). The possible moves are:\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) → (0,2) → but x=0 is a wall → invalid (collision).\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) → (1,3) → need to check if this is safe.\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) → (1,1) → need to check if this is safe.\n- Right (R): (x+1,y) → (2,2) → but (2,2) is the second segment of the snake → potential collision unless it's the tail that will move.\n\n**No instant reverse**: Since current direction is L, cannot move R next. But R is not directly opposite (opposite of L is R, but since we're moving L, next move can't be R). Wait, is that correct? Actually, the rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so next move cannot be R. So R is invalid.\n\nWait, let me clarify the \"no instant reverse\" rule. It means if the snake was moving left in the last move, it cannot move right in the next move. So possible moves are U, D, or continue L (but L is invalid due to wall). So possible moves are U or D.\n\n### Checking Move Up (U) to (1,3):\n\n- New head position: (1,3).\n- Check if (1,3) is occupied by body or wall:\n  - Body positions: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3).\n  - (1,3) is not in the body segments → safe.\n  - Walls: internal obstacles include (1,4), but (1,3) is not a wall → safe.\n  \n- Is there food at (1,3)? No, food is at (4,6) and (3,6).\n  \nSo moving U is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Checking Move Down (D) to (1,1):\n\n- New head position: (1,1).\n- Check if (1,1) is occupied by body or wall:\n  - Body segments: (1,1) is not in the list → safe.\n  - Walls: (1,1) is not a wall → safe.\n  \n- Is there food at (1,1)? No.\n  \nSo moving D is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nBoth foods are at (4,6) and (3,6), which are far from the current head position (1,2). Given the snake's length and position, it's impossible to reach either food in one move. Both foods will disappear after this turn, so they are not reachable.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food:\n- Tail is at (3,3).\n- Head is at (1,2).\n- Adjacent cells to head: (0,2) [wall], (2,2), (1,3), (1,1).\n  - (2,2) is the second segment → not tail.\n  - Tail is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to head (distance is sqrt((3-1)^2 + (3-2)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5) > 1).\n  \nSo no tail reward danger.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nBoth U and D are safe but don't lead to food. Which is better?\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Moving U to (1,3): \n  - Next possible moves from (1,3): U to (1,4) which is a wall (internal obstacle at (1,4)), so not good.\n- Moving D to (1,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (1,1): D to (1,0) is wall, L to (0,1) is wall, R to (2,1) is body (second segment is at (2,2), but (2,1) is third segment), U back to (1,2).\n  \nNeither is great, but moving D seems slightly better because from (1,1), the only safe move next would be U back to (1,2), but at least it's not immediately trapping.\n\nAlternatively, moving U to (1,3) leads to being next to a wall, limiting options next turn.\n\nGiven that, moving D seems the lesser of two evils.\n\n### Verifying Snake Movement\n\nAfter moving D to (1,1):\n- New head: (1,1).\n- Body shifts: tail (3,3) is removed, new segment added at head.\n- New body: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), ..., (4,3)].\n\nThis seems safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest immediate action is to move Down (D), as moving Up (U) would lead to being next to a wall, limiting future moves. Neither move can reach the food this turn, so avoiding immediate danger is the priority.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)].\n   - Current head direction: Down (D).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (4,6): value=1, life_span=1.\n   - (3,6): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (4,5): value=10, life_span=1.\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,1), and it's currently moving Down (D). \n\nPossible moves from Down (D):\n- Cannot instantly reverse to Up (U).\n- Can move Left (L), Right (R), or continue Down (D).\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D): (1,1) → (1,0)\n- (1,0): \n  - y=0 is a border wall → collision → death.\n- **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L): (1,1) → (0,1)\n- (0,1):\n  - x=0 is a border wall → collision → death.\n- **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R): (1,1) → (2,1)\n- (2,1):\n  - Check if it's part of the snake's body:\n    - Snake body segments: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3).\n    - (2,1) is the 4th segment (counting from 0: head is 0, then 1,2,3 is (2,1)).\n    - The tail is at (4,3), which will move forward when the head moves, so the only body part to worry about is the one just after the head.\n    - The segment after head is (1,2), not (2,1). So moving to (2,1) is safe because the tail is moving away.\n  - Not a wall.\n- **Valid move**.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Right (R) to (2,1) leads to any food:\n- (2,1) is not in the food positions listed.\n- So no immediate food gain from this move.\n\nAre there other considerations?\n- The food at (4,6), (3,6), (4,5) is all at the top part of the grid (y=5,6), and our snake is at the bottom (y=1).\n- The life span of all food is 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n- To reach any food, we'd need multiple moves, but since the food will disappear next turn, we can't reach any in this move.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any other move that might be better?\n- Only Right (R) is valid from the current position and direction.\n- Down and Left lead to immediate death.\n- So, Right is the only safe move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could cause a collision if eaten?\n- Tail is at (4,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4).\n  - (4,4) is a wall.\n  - Other adjacent cells: no food listed there.\n- So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Right (R). Moving Right to (2,1) doesn't lead to any immediate food, but it's the only way to avoid death this turn. All other moves lead to immediate collision with walls or body.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",
