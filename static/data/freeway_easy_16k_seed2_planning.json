We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8) at the moment we are on that freeway.\n\nImportant: \n- The player updates position at the same time as the cars move? Actually, the problem says: at turn T, if we are on freeway y_T, then we check if 0 (the x-coordinate) is in the span of any car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nBut note: the car update rule gives the span at turn T in terms of the initial turn t1. Since we are starting at turn t1=0, then for any future turn T (>=0), the car positions are computed as:\n\nFor a left-moving car (direction left) that at turn t1=0 has head h and tail τ, then at turn T, the span is [h - s*T, τ - s*T] (because T-t1 = T).\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: [τ + s*T, h + s*T].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if we are on a freeway k (which we are at that turn) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: when we move (U, D, or S) at turn t, then at the next turn we are at y_{t+1}. So at turn t, we are at y_t. Therefore, at turn t, we check the freeway y_t (if y_t is between 1 and 8) for collisions.\n\nWe start at turn 0 at y0=0 (which is not a freeway, so no car collision check). Then we choose an action a0, which will lead to y1 = y0 + Δy0. Then at turn 1, we are at (0,y1) and we check for collisions on freeway y1 if y1 is in [1,8].\n\nOur goal: reach (0,9). Note that y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above 8, so once we are at 9 we are safe.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from turn 0 to turn H-1 such that at the end of turn H-1 (i.e., at turn H-1 we take an action that puts us at 9 at the next state? But note: we are at turn t1+H-1 at position (0,9). Actually, the problem says: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1, and then at the next state (turn t1+H) we are at (0,9)? But note the update: after taking action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. So if we take actions at turns 0 to H-1, then we have y_0, y_1, ... y_H. We want y_H = 9. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). But note: the action at the last turn (t1+H-1) produces the next state at turn t1+H. So we must have that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). That means we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" is not the same.\n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at turn t1+H-1, the position is (0,9). How does that happen?\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t, which updates the state to y_{t+1} at the next turn (turn t+1). Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0, y) and then we choose an action that leaves us at 9? But note: the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at the next state at turn t1+H. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut then why take an action at turn t1+H-1? We are already at 9? Actually, the problem says: we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So we take H actions. Then the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis seems confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). How do we get there? \n\nAt turn t1, we are at (0,y0) and we take an action a_{t1} which leads to y1 at turn t1+1. Then at turn t1+1 we are at (0,y1). Then we take action a_{t1+1} leading to y2 at turn t1+2, and so on. We want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? Because the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1? That would be H actions. Then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is the state after the (H-1)-th action? Actually, the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given. Then:\n\n- At turn t1: we are at (0,y0). We take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: we are at (0,y1) = (0, y0 + Δy_{t1})\n- At turn t1+1: we are at (0,y1). Take action a_{t1+1} -> at turn t1+2: (0,y2)\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-1: we are at (0, y_{H-1}) and we take action a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H: we are at (0, y_H)\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we want y_{H-1} = 9? And then we take an action at that turn? But that action might take us to 10? But y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go beyond 9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we don't necessarily take an action that moves us from 9? But note the actions we output include turn t1+H-1. So we must output an action for that turn.\n\nHowever, once we are at 9, we can just stay? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? But what if we are at 9 and we take U? Then we try to go to 10, which is not allowed? So we must take S or D? But D would take us to 8, which is not 9.\n\nSo it seems the problem expects that we end at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that doesn't change the position? But the action S (stay) would keep us at 9. So we can take S at the last turn? But note: we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we take S and then at turn t1+H we are still at 9. But the problem says we only care about being at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we have to output an action for that turn? Then we output an action that doesn't move us? So the minimal H must include the turn at which we first become at 9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions for H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at 9? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nLooking at the example: the answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we output an action for that turn? But that action doesn't change the position? Or the problem might mean that we take the actions and then at the next state (turn t1+H) we are at 9? But then we wouldn't have an action for turn t1+H.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me check the problem again: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis implies that the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). How did we get there? The last action we took was at turn t1+H-2? Then why do we have an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at the beginning of the turn? Then the state update happens after the action? So:\n\n- At the beginning of turn t: state is (0, y_t)\n- We choose action a_t\n- Then the state for the next turn (t+1) is computed: y_{t+1} = clamp(y_t + Δy_t, 0,9)\n\nBut then the problem says we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. That means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and move to the next state. But we don't care about the next state? The goal is only to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut then why take an action after that? The problem says the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. So we are taking H actions. The state at the beginning of the first turn (t1) is given. Then after H actions, we have been through H state transitions? Then we would be at turn t1+H? \n\nExample: \n- t1=0: we start at y0=0.\n- We take action a0: then at turn 1 we are at y1.\n- Then take a1: then at turn 2 we are at y2.\n- ...\n- After taking action a_{H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we are at turn t1+H at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? That would be y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9. How do we achieve that? We took actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 (which will determine y_{t1+H}) but we don't care about that state.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal H such that there exists a sequence of H-1 actions that take us from y0=0 to y_{H-1}=9, and then we take the H-th action at turn t1+H-1 (which can be arbitrary? but we have to output it). However, note that the problem requires to output the sequence of actions for the turns t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nBut if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we can take any action? But we must avoid going out of bounds? The update: y_{t+1} = clamp(y_t + Δy_t, 0,9). So if we are at 9 and take U, then we stay at 9? Similarly, D would take us to 8, but then we are not at 9 anymore? But the goal is only to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. The action at that turn doesn't affect our goal. However, we have to output an action. We can output S to stay? Or U? But if we take U, we stay at 9. So we can choose S.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions? At turn t1+H-1, we are at freeway? If we are at 9, then we are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1 to 8). So no collision check. Then we can choose any action? But if we choose D, we go to 8, which is a freeway? But at the next turn (t1+H) we would be at 8, and then we have to check for collisions? But the problem doesn't require us to avoid collisions after we have reached 9? Because the goal is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. So after that, we don't care? But the problem says \"avoid collisions\" only while we are moving? Actually, we must avoid collisions at every turn when we are on a freeway (1-8) during the entire sequence until we reach 9.\n\nBut at the last turn (turn t1+H-1), we are at 9 (which is safe) and then we take an action. The result of that action (at turn t1+H) might put us at 8? Then we would have to check for collision at turn t1+H? But the problem doesn't say we have to be safe after reaching 9. It only says \"to reach (0,9)\" and avoid collisions during the journey. So the journey ends at the moment we are at 9? That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then the action we take at that turn is not part of the journey? But the problem says we must output an action for that turn. However, we are already at the goal. So we can take any action? But to be safe, we can take S (so we remain at 9) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9 and safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can take U and remain at 9? Or D and go to 8? But going to 8 at turn t1+H would be after the goal, so it doesn't matter? But the problem does not require us to avoid collisions after the goal. So we can choose any action. However, to be consistent, let us choose S.\n\nTherefore, we are to find the minimal H such that we can get from (0,0) at turn 0 to (0,9) at the beginning of turn H-1? Actually, we have:\n\n- Turn 0: start at y0=0. Then we take action a0 -> leads to y1 at turn 1.\n- Turn 1: at y1, then take a1 -> leads to y2 at turn 2.\n- ...\n- We want at the beginning of turn T to be at 9. And T = H-1? \n\nBut H is the number of turns we are taking actions? And we take actions at turns 0,1,...,H-1. Then the state at the beginning of turn H-1 is y_{H-1}. We want y_{H-1}=9.\n\nHow many actions have been taken by the beginning of turn H-1? We have taken actions at turns 0,1,...,H-2. That is H-1 actions. Then the state at turn H-1 is the result after H-1 actions? \n\nBut we start at turn 0: state0 = 0.\nAfter 1 action (at turn0): state1 at turn1.\nAfter 2 actions: state2 at turn2.\n...\nAfter k actions: state_k at turn k.\n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T, we need T = k, and we have taken k actions? Then we have H actions in total? Then T = H-1? \n\nSo we are at 9 at turn H-1. Then we take an action at turn H-1 (the H-th action) and then we are at state H at turn H.\n\nTherefore, we must have taken H-1 actions to get to 9 at turn H-1. So the minimal H such that we can get to 9 at turn H-1. Then H-1 is the number of steps to get to 9? So the minimal number of steps to get to 9 is K, then H = K+1? Because we take K steps to get to 9 (at turn K) and then we take one more action (at turn K) which is the (K+1)-th action? But then H = K+1.\n\nBut the problem says: minimal number of turns H. And we are to output actions for turns 0 to H-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: we want to be at 9 at turn T. Then the number of actions taken to get there is T. Because at turn 0 we start, then after 1 action we are at turn1, after 2 actions at turn2, ... after T actions we are at turn T. Then we want to be at 9 at turn T. Then we take an action at turn T? But then we are at turn T+1. But we are required to output an action for turn T? So H = T+1.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to reach at turn t1+H-1. So if we set T = t1+H-1, then we are at 9 at turn T. How many actions have been taken? From turn0 to turn T-1? That is T actions? But then we are to output actions from turn0 to turn T? That is T+1 actions? And H = T+1? \n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn T, which is t1+H-1 = 0 + (T+1) - 1 = T. So that matches. Therefore, if we need to be at 9 at turn T, then H = T+1, and we output actions for turn0 to turn T.\n\nBut note: we start at turn0 at y0=0. Then we take actions at turn0, turn1, ... up to turn T (which is the H-1-th turn, because H-1 = T). Then we have taken H actions? H = T+1, so we take actions at turns 0 to T (inclusive) -> T+1 actions? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, which is T+1 actions? But we only need T actions to get to 9 at turn T? \n\nActually, the state at turn T is the result of the actions taken at turns 0 to T-1. Then the action at turn T is taken after we have already reached 9. So we need to take T actions to get to 9 at turn T (via actions at turns0 to T-1) and then we take an extra action at turn T. But that extra action is not necessary for reaching 9? But the problem requires the sequence to be of length H, and we must output H actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal T such that we can be at 9 at turn T (the beginning of turn T) using actions from turn0 to turn T-1. Then H = T+1, and we output:\n\nTurn0: a0\nTurn1: a1\n...\nTurn T: a_T (which can be S, since we are at 9)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". So H is the number of turns we are taking actions? And we want to minimize that? But the extra action at the end is always there. So we want to minimize T (the turn at which we first become at 9) and then set H = T+1? But then H is not the minimal if we can avoid the extra action? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow us to stop at the turn when we reach 9? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we must output H actions.\n\nTherefore, we must find the minimal T (>=0) such that we can be at 9 at turn T (beginning of turn T) by taking T actions (from turn0 to turn T-1). Then we set H = T+1, and we output the T actions that got us to 9 at turn T, and then one more action (at turn T, we can choose S).\n\nBut note: the minimal T might not be unique? We want the minimal T such that there is a sequence of T actions (a0 to a_{T-1}) that takes us from 0 to 9 in T steps (so that at turn T we are at 9) without colliding. Then we add one more action (at turn T) to make H = T+1.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is T+1, where T is the minimal number of steps (state transitions) to reach 9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn0 at 0. Then after 1 action: at turn1 we are at y1. After 2 actions: at turn2 we are at y2. ... After T actions: at turn T we are at y_T. We want y_T = 9.\n\nSo T is the number of actions taken to get to 9. Then we need to output T+1 actions? But the last action is at turn T, and we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn T? Then the action at turn T is taken at the state 9. So we can choose S. Then the sequence has T+1 actions.\n\nBut the minimal number of turns H is T+1? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we are to output H actions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might count the starting turn as turn0 and then we take actions for H turns? Then we are at turn H after H actions. But then we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1? That would be after H-1 actions? \n\nI think the safest is to re-read the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). How many actions have been taken? We have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? That is H-1 actions. Because the actions are for t from 0 to H-1, which corresponds to turns t1+0 to t1+H-1. But the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then the state at the next turn (t1+H) is updated. But we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we haven't taken the action of that turn yet? Then how did we get to 9? We got there by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken after we have reached 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of actions to reach 9 is K, then we set H = K+1, and we output K actions to get to 9 and then one extra action (S) at the last turn.\n\nBut the minimal H is then K+1, and K is the minimal steps to reach 9.\n\nNow, what is the minimal K to go from 0 to 9? Without any cars, the minimal number of actions is 9 (if we only go up). But with cars, we may have to wait sometimes, so it might be more.\n\nBut note: we can also go down? But going down from 0 is not allowed (y>=0). We can only go up or stay. So to go from 0 to 9, we must take at least 9 up actions. And we can interleave with stays. So the minimal K is 9.\n\nBut with cars, we might have to wait (i.e., stay) at some freeways to avoid collisions. So K might be more than 9.\n\nWe need to compute the minimal K such that there is a sequence of K actions (each U, D, or S) that take us from 0 to 9 in exactly K steps (so that at the beginning of turn K we are at 9) and during the journey, we avoid collisions.\n\nNote: at each step i (from 0 to K-1), we are at a freeway y_i (at turn i) and we must not collide with any car on that freeway at turn i.\n\nBut note: at turn0, we are at y0=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision. Then at turn1, we are at y1 (which is either 0 or 1). If y1=1, then we check freeway1 at turn1; if y1=0, then we are still not on a freeway.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn0. We take action a0 at turn0, which moves us to y1 = y0 + Δy0. Then at turn1, we are at (0,y1). If y1 is between 1 and 8, then we check for collision at turn1 on freeway y1.\n\nThen we take action a1 at turn1, which moves us to y2, and at turn2 we are at (0,y2), and if y2 in [1,8] we check for collision at turn2 on freeway y2.\n\nWe must be at y_K = 9 at the beginning of turn K.\n\nWe are to find the minimal K (>=9) such that there is a sequence of K actions (a0 to a_{K-1}) that achieves this.\n\nThen H = K+1, and we output the K actions that got us to 9 at turn K, and then one more action (S) at turn K.\n\nBut note: we are at 9 at turn K, so the action at turn K can be S.\n\nNow, let's model the cars.\n\nWe have freeways 1 to 8. Each freeway has a list of cars with (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn0.\n\nFor a freeway k, and at a future turn T, the cars on that freeway have spans:\n\nIf the car is left-moving (d='left'): span at turn T = [h - s*T, τ - s*T]\nIf the car is right-moving (d='right'): span at turn T = [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nBut note: the problem says for a left-moving car, the initial span is [h, τ] and then it moves left: so the head (which is the front) is at h, and then at turn T, the head is at h - s*T, and the tail is at τ - s*T. But note: the head might be less than the tail? Actually, in the example, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). That seems odd because 48 < 83, and moving left? Then the car would be from 48 to 83? But then at turn T, it becomes [48-36T, 83-36T]. Similarly, for freeway 3: a car (-48,-59,right,12): then at turn T: [-59+12T, -48+12T].\n\nWe must check if 0 is in the span at turn T. That is, for a left-moving car, we need 0 in [h - s*T, τ - s*T]? But if h < τ, then the span is [h - s*T, τ - s*T] and it is increasing. But in freeway1, we have (48,83,left,36): so at T=0, the car is from 48 to 83? But that is a positive segment. Moving left, it will eventually cover 0? But 48 - 36*T <=0 and 83-36*T>=0? \n\nAt T=0: 48 to 83 -> 0 is not in [48,83].\nAt T=1: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47] -> not 0.\nAt T=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11] -> now 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes, because -24<=0<=11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 is the same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway3 and 4: \n  Car1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> wait, the head is -48 and tail is -59? But if it's right-moving, the problem says: the span at T0 is [τ, h]? Actually, the problem says for a right-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" -> so at T0, the car is from τ to h. Here τ=-59, h=-48? So from -59 to -48? Then at turn T: [τ + s*T, h + s*T] = [-59+12T, -48+12T]. When does 0 fall in this? \n  Solve: -59+12T <= 0 <= -48+12T -> \n  12T <= 59 -> T <= 59/12 ≈ 4.9 -> T<=4\n  12T >= 48 -> T>=4\n  So at T=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [a,b] inclusive? Then 0 is included.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T)\". At T=4, the car is from -11 to 0, so 0 is included -> collision.\n\n  But note: the car representation: for a right-moving car, the initial state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). The head is the front? Then for a right-moving car, the front is to the right, so head > tail. But here, head=-48, tail=-59? Then head>tail? -48 > -59, yes. So the car is from tail=-59 to head=-48. Then at T=4, it is from -59+48 = -11 to -48+48=0. So 0 is included.\n\n  Similarly, the next car: (-12,-23,right,12): \n      at T0: [-23,-12] (because tail=-23, head=-12)\n      at turn T: [-23+12T, -12+12T]\n      We want 0 in this interval: \n        -23+12T <= 0 <= -12+12T\n        T>= ceil(23/12)= ceil(1.91)=2\n        T>=2 and T<= ceil(12/12)=1? -> no, wait:\n        From -23+12T<=0 -> T<=23/12≈1.91 -> so T<=1? \n        and 0<=-12+12T -> 12T>=12 -> T>=1.\n        So at T=1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? -> collision at T=1.\n\n  And the third car: (24,13,right,12): \n      head=24, tail=13 -> at T0: [13,24]\n      at turn T: [13+12T, 24+12T]\n      This is always positive, so 0 is never in it.\n\n  So for freeway3 and 4, we have collisions at:\n      T=1: by car (-12,-23,right,12) -> freeway3 and 4 are the same, so at T=1, both freeways have a car covering 0.\n      T=4: by car (-48,-59,right,12) -> at T=4, freeway3 and 4 have a car from -11 to 0.\n\nFreeway5,6,7: \n  Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> head=48, tail=37 -> at T0: [37,48], then at T: [37+12T,48+12T] -> always positive, so 0 not included.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> head=0, tail=-11 -> at T0: [-11,0] -> already at T0, 0 is included? \n        So at turn0, this car is at [-11,0] -> collision if we are at freeway5,6,7 at turn0? \n        But note: we are not at any freeway at turn0. But if we are at freeway5 at turn0? We are at turn0 at y0=0 -> we are not on freeway5 (which is at y=5). So no collision.\n\n        At turn T: the car is [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [-11+12T, 12T]\n        When does 0 fall in this?\n          -11+12T <= 0 <= 12T -> \n          T>= ceil(11/12) -> T>=1? and T>=0 (trivially). Actually, at T=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included. At T=1: [1,12] -> 0 not included. \n        So only at T=0? \n\n        But we are at freeway5 at turn T only if we are at y=5 at that turn. So if we are at freeway5 at turn0, we would collide? But we are not at freeway5 at turn0. We start at y0=0.\n\n        However, if we are at freeway5 at a turn T, then we check the car at that turn T. \n        For this car: at T>=1, the car is at [ -11+12T, 12T] which for T>=1 is at least [1,12] (at T=1) -> 0 not included. \n        So only at T=0 it covers 0. But we will never be at freeway5 at turn0? \n\n        Similarly, freeway6 and 7 have the same car.\n\nFreeway8:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,4) -> [37+4T,48+4T] -> always positive, so safe.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,4) -> at T0: [-11,0] -> so at T0, it covers 0. But again, we are not at freeway8 at T0.\n        At T>=1: [-11+4T, 4T]\n        At T=1: [-7,4] -> 0 is in? -7<=0<=4 -> yes, so at T=1, 0 is in the car? \n        At T=2: [-3,8] -> 0 in? yes.\n        At T=3: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n        So at T=1 and T=2, the car covers 0.\n\nTherefore, we summarize the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: T=2 -> because at T=2, the car covers [-24,11] which includes 0.\n           Actually, at T=0: [48,83] -> no\n           T=1: [12,47] -> no\n           T=2: [-24,11] -> yes\n           T=3: [-60,-25] -> no (because 0 is not in [-60,-25])\n           So only T=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: same as freeway1: dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway3: \n  Car1: (-48,-59,right,12): dangerous at T=4 (because at T=4: [-11,0])\n  Car2: (-12,-23,right,12): dangerous at T=1 (because at T=1: [-11,0])\n  Car3: (24,13,right,12): safe.\n  So freeway3 is dangerous at T=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3: dangerous at T=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway5:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,12): safe.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,12): dangerous only at T=0? But we are not at freeway5 at T=0. At T>=1: the car moves to positive and doesn't cover 0. So freeway5 is safe at all turns? \n        Actually, at T=0: the car is at [-11,0] -> but we are at freeway5 only if we are at y=5 at turn0 -> we are not. So safe.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at freeway5 at a turn T? Then we check the car at that turn. The car at turn T is at [-11+12T, 12T]. \n        For T>=1: the car is at [1,12] (T=1), [13,24] (T=2), etc. -> 0 not included. \n        So freeway5 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 and 7: same as freeway5 -> always safe.\n\nFreeway8:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,4): safe.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,4): dangerous at T=1 and T=2: because at T=1: [-7,4] -> 0 in; at T=2: [-3,8] -> 0 in; at T=3: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo summary:\n\nFreeway1: dangerous at T=2\nFreeway2: dangerous at T=2\nFreeway3: dangerous at T=1,4\nFreeway4: dangerous at T=1,4\nFreeway5: safe at all T\nFreeway6: safe at all T\nFreeway7: safe at all T\nFreeway8: dangerous at T=1,2\n\nWe need to go from y0=0 to y_K=9 in K steps (K>=9), and at each turn i (from 1 to K-1) if we are at freeway y_i (which is between 1 and 8) then turn i must not be a dangerous turn for that freeway.\n\nNote: at turn0 we are at y0=0 (safe). Then at turn1 we are at y1, which might be 0 or 1. If it is 1, then we check freeway1 at turn1: is turn1 dangerous for freeway1? From above, freeway1 is only dangerous at T=2, so at turn1 it is safe. Similarly, if we are at freeway2 at turn1, it is safe (only dangerous at T=2). Freeway3 at turn1: dangerous at T=1 -> so if we are at freeway3 at turn1, we collide.\n\nWe must avoid being at:\n- freeway1 at turn2\n- freeway2 at turn2\n- freeway3 at turn1 or turn4\n- freeway4 at turn1 or turn4\n- freeway8 at turn1 or turn2\n\nAnd freeways 5,6,7 are always safe.\n\nOur moves: at each turn, we can go up, down, or stay. But we start at 0 and want to get to 9. Since we cannot go below 0, we can only go up or stay. So we must have at least 9 up moves.\n\nWe are to minimize K (the number of steps to get to 9). The minimal K is 9, so we try K=9 first.\n\nWith K=9, we are at turn9 at y9=9. We must have taken exactly 9 up moves? Or can we have stays? If we take a stay, then we would need more than 9 steps? So for K=9, we must take 9 up moves: U at every step. Then the path is:\n\nTurn0: start at 0, take U -> turn1: at 1\nTurn1: take U -> turn2: at 2\nTurn2: at 3\nTurn3: at 4\nTurn4: at 5\nTurn5: at 6\nTurn6: at 7\nTurn7: at 8\nTurn8: at 9\n\nBut we are at 9 at turn9? Wait: we take actions at turn0 to turn8 (9 actions) and then at turn9 we are at 9.\n\nBut we are to be at 9 at the beginning of turn9? So that matches.\n\nNow, we check for collisions:\n\nAt turn1: we are at freeway1. Check freeway1 at turn1: freeway1 is dangerous only at turn2 -> safe.\n\nAt turn2: we are at freeway2. Freeway2 is dangerous at turn2 -> collision! So we cannot be at freeway2 at turn2.\n\nTherefore, the direct path in 9 steps fails.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway2 at turn2. How? We can delay one of the steps.\n\nOption: at some turn, we stay instead of going up. Then we will take 10 steps.\n\nWe try K=10: we have 9 U and 1 S. We need to insert the S somewhere.\n\nWe want to avoid being at freeway2 at turn2. Currently, in the direct path we are:\n\nturn0: 0 -> action U -> turn1:1\nturn1:1 -> action U -> turn2:2 -> collision at freeway2 at turn2.\n\nWe can avoid being at freeway2 at turn2 by either:\n- Not being at freeway2 at turn2: that is, not at y=2 at turn2.\n\nHow? We can do:\n\nOption 1: At turn1, instead of going up, we stay. Then:\n  turn0: U -> turn1:1\n  turn1: S -> turn2:1 (still at freeway1) -> then we avoid freeway2 at turn2.\n\nBut then we are at freeway1 at turn2: freeway1 is dangerous at turn2! -> collision.\n\nOption 2: At turn0, we stay. Then:\n  turn0: S -> turn1:0 (safe, not a freeway)\n  turn1: U -> turn2:1 (freeway1, and turn2: freeway1 is dangerous -> collision.\n\nOption 3: At turn2, we stay? But we are at freeway2 at turn2: we are already there. We cannot avoid by staying? The action at turn2 determines the next state. But at the beginning of turn2 we are at freeway2 and we check -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway2 at turn2 by being at a different freeway at turn2. But the only way to be at a freeway different than 2 at turn2 is to have taken a different path.\n\nWe start at 0.\nAfter two actions, we can be at:\n  Option: \n    U then U: 2\n    U then S: 1\n    U then D: 0 (but D from 1: 1-1=0) -> then at turn2 we are at 0 (safe).\n    S then U: 1\n    S then S: 0\n    S then D: 0 (if at 0, D would go to 0 because bounded) -> 0\n    D then U: 0->0 (D: 0-1=0) then U:0+1=1\n    D then S: 0\n    D then D: 0\n\nSo after two actions, we can be at 0,1, or 2.\n\nWe want to avoid being at 2 at turn2? Then we can be at 0 or 1.\n\nBut if we are at 1 at turn2, then we are at freeway1 at turn2: which is dangerous -> collision.\n\nIf we are at 0 at turn2, then safe (not a freeway).\n\nSo the only safe state at turn2 is 0.\n\nHow to be at 0 at turn2? \n  We start at 0.\n  Option1: \n      turn0: D -> stays at 0 (because D from 0: 0-1 -> clamped to 0)\n      turn1: D or S -> stays at 0 -> then at turn2:0.\n  Option2:\n      turn0: S -> stays at 0\n      turn1: D or S -> stays at 0 -> turn2:0.\n  Option3:\n      turn0: U -> to 1\n      turn1: D -> to 0\n\nSo one possibility: U then D.\n\nBut then we are at 0 at turn2. Then we have lost progress.\n\nWe then need to make up the steps. We need to get to 9. We have taken 2 steps and we are back at 0. Then we need at least 9 more steps? So total at least 11 steps.\n\nBut we might be able to go faster later.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid freeway2 at turn2 by being at 0 at turn2, then at turn2 we take U to go to 1, but then at turn3 we are at 1? and then we continue.\n\nBut then the entire path will be delayed.\n\nWe want minimal K. So we try K=10 first.\n\nWith 10 steps, we have 9 U and 1 extra move (which can be S or D). But D would lose progress, so we prefer S? Or we might use D to avoid a collision and then come back.\n\nWe try to avoid the collisions:\n\nWe have to avoid:\n- freeway2 at turn2 (by not being at 2 at turn2)\n- freeway1 at turn2 (if we are at 1 at turn2) -> but we see that freeway1 is dangerous at turn2, so we must avoid being at 1 at turn2 as well.\n\nSo at turn2, the only safe state is 0.\n\nSo we must be at 0 at turn2.\n\nHow? \n  Option: \n      turn0: U -> to 1 (turn1: at freeway1, which is safe at turn1)\n      turn1: D -> to 0 (turn2: at 0, safe)\n\nThen we are at 0 at turn2. Then we have to start over.\n\nNow, from turn2 (at 0) we need to get to 9 in 8 steps? But 8 up moves would get us to 8 at turn10, but we need 9 at turn10? So we need 9 up moves from turn2 to turn10? That would be 9 actions: turn2 to turn10 (inclusive) -> 9 actions? Then at turn11 we would be at 9? But we want to be at 9 at turn10? \n\nWe are at turn2: at 0.\nWe take actions at turn2, turn3, ..., turn9 (8 actions) -> then at turn10 we are at y10.\n\nWith 8 up moves, we would be at 8 at turn10. We need to be at 9 at turn10, so we need 9 up moves? But then we need 9 actions from turn2 to turn10? That is turn2 to turn10: 9 actions? Then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn10? That is, at the beginning of turn10 we are at 9. How many actions from turn2? We need 10 actions? But we only have from turn2 to turn9 (8 actions) for the next 8 turns? Then at turn10 we would be at 8+? = 8 (if we did 8 up moves) and then we need one more.\n\nActually, we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10. The actions we take from turn2 to turn9 (8 actions) will get us to a state at turn10. We can be at 9 at turn10 if we have taken 9 up moves in total? But we already did one up and one down (net 0) in the first two turns. Then we need 9 up moves in the next 8 actions? That is not possible.\n\nSo we must have at least 9 up moves after turn2? Then we are at 9 at turn2+9 = turn11.\n\nTherefore, the total steps K is 11: we are at 9 at turn11.\n\nBut we are at turn0, then after 11 actions, we are at turn11. Then we set H = 12? Because we output 12 actions: 11 to get to 9 at turn11, and then one more action at turn11.\n\nBut let me verify the turns:\n\nWe want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\nThe actions:\n\nturn0: U -> then turn1: at 1 (freeway1 at turn1: safe)\nturn1: D -> then turn2: at 0 (safe)\nturn2: U -> turn3: at 1 (freeway1 at turn3: safe? freeway1 dangerous only at T=2 -> safe)\nturn3: U -> turn4: at 2 (freeway2 at turn4: freeway2 dangerous at T=2 -> turn4 is 4, safe)\nturn4: U -> turn5: at 3 (freeway3 at turn5: freeway3 dangerous at T=1 and T=4 -> turn5 is 5, safe)\nturn5: U -> turn6: at 4 (freeway4 at turn6: dangerous at T=1 and T=4 -> turn6 is 6, safe? no, T=6? we only have data for T=1,4 -> so safe)\nturn6: U -> turn7: at 5 (freeway5: safe)\nturn7: U -> turn8: at 6 (freeway6: safe)\nturn8: U -> turn9: at 7 (freeway7: safe)\nturn9: U -> turn10: at 8 (freeway8 at turn10: freeway8 dangerous at T=1 and T=2 -> turn10 is 10, safe? \n        We need to check: freeway8 has a car that is dangerous at T=1 and T=2. At T=10, the car2: [ -11+4*10, 4*10] = [29,40] -> 0 not included -> safe)\nturn10: U -> turn11: at 9 -> goal at turn11.\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\nThe actions we took: 11 actions (from turn0 to turn10). Then we need to output one more action at turn11? So H=12.\n\nBut the problem: we output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn0 to turn11.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nturn0: U\nturn1: D\nturn2: U\nturn3: U\nturn4: U\nturn5: U\nturn6: U\nturn7: U\nturn8: U\nturn9: U\nturn10: U -> gets us to 9 at turn11.\nturn11: S (or any action, but we choose S to stay at 9)\n\nSo H=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We had to take a detour at the beginning. Can we avoid the collisions with fewer than 11 steps to 9?\n\nWe know that we must be at 0 at turn2. Then we have to go up 9 times from turn2 to turn11? That is 9 up moves: from turn2 to turn10 (9 actions) and then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nSo the minimal K is 11.\n\nBut is there a path with K=10? That is, be at 9 at turn10.\n\nWe have to take 10 actions (from turn0 to turn9) to be at 9 at turn10.\n\nWe must be at 0 at turn2. Then from turn2 to turn9 (8 actions) we must go from 0 to 9? That requires 9 up moves, but we only have 8 actions -> impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal K is 11.\n\nBut wait, we might avoid being at 0 at turn2 by taking a different route? For example, skip freeway2 at turn2 by not being there, but we also cannot be at freeway1 at turn2 (because it is dangerous). So the only safe place at turn2 is 0.\n\nWhat about freeway3? At turn2, freeway3 is safe? Because freeway3 is dangerous at T=1 and T=4. At T=2, it is safe. So we could be at freeway3 (y=3) at turn2? But to be at 3 at turn2, we would need two up moves: turn0: U->1, turn1: U->2, then at turn2 we are at 3? But then at turn1 we are at 2? But freeway2 at turn1: is it dangerous? Freeway2 is dangerous only at T=2, so at turn1 (T=1) it is safe? Then:\n\nPath for K=10:\n\nWe want to be at 9 at turn10.\n\nOption: \n  turn0: U -> turn1:1 (freeway1 at turn1: safe)\n  turn1: U -> turn2:2 (freeway2 at turn2: dangerous! -> collision)\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe could do:\n  turn0: U -> turn1:1 (safe)\n  turn1: U -> turn2:2 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at 2 at turn2.\n\nWhat if we go up faster? We cannot: two up moves get us to 2 at turn2.\n\nThe only safe place at turn2 is 0 or 3? But 3 at turn2: we would have to do U then U -> 2 at turn2? Then we are at 2, which is dangerous. We cannot get to 3 in two moves? We start at 0: after two moves, we can be at most 2.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 0 at turn2.\n\nHence, the minimal K is 11.\n\nWe have one more constraint: freeway3 and freeway4 are dangerous at turn4. We need to check if at turn4 we are at freeway3 or freeway4.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt turn4: we are at 2? Let me recount:\n\nturn0: U -> turn1:1\nturn1: D -> turn2:0\nturn2: U -> turn3:1\nturn3: U -> turn4:2\n\nSo at turn4, we are at freeway2. Freeway2 is dangerous only at turn2 -> so safe.\n\nThen turn4: U -> turn5:3 -> freeway3 at turn5: freeway3 dangerous at T=1 and T=4 -> turn5 is 5? So T=5? The dangerous turns are T=1 and T=4. T=5 is not dangerous -> safe.\n\nThen the rest is safe.\n\nBut we also have freeway8 dangerous at turn1 and turn2. In our path, we are at freeway8 at turn10? Turn10: we are at freeway8? \n  turn10: we are at 8 (because we do U at turn10: from 8 to 9 at turn11). \n  At the beginning of turn10, we are at 8? Then we take U to go to 9. So at turn10, we are at freeway8. \n  Check freeway8 at turn10: dangerous at T=1 and T=2 -> T=10 is safe.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal K is 11 (steps to get to 9 at turn11). Then H = 12 (since we output 12 actions: turns0 to11).\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn0: U\nTurn1: D\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S\n\nBut at turn11, we are at 9 and we take S to stay.\n\nBut note: at turn1 we went down to 0, which is safe. Then at turn2 we go up to 1, then we go up continuously to 9.\n\nBut we must check every freeway we step on.\n\nAt turn1: y1=1 -> freeway1 at turn1: dangerous? freeway1: only dangerous at T=2 -> safe.\nAt turn2: y2=0 -> not a freeway, safe.\nAt turn3: y3=1 -> freeway1 at turn3: dangerous at T=2? T=3 -> safe.\nAt turn4: y4=2 -> freeway2 at turn4: dangerous at T=2? T=4 -> safe.\nAt turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3 at turn5: dangerous at T=1,4? T=5 -> safe.\nAt turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4 at turn6: dangerous at T=1,4? T=6 -> safe.\nAt turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5: safe.\nAt turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6: safe.\nAt turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7: safe.\nAt turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8 at turn10: dangerous at T=1,2? T=10 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn11: we are at 9 (after the action at turn10: U from 8 to 9) -> so at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9.\n\nThen we take S at turn11.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". Here H=12. Is there a path with H=11? That is, be at 9 at turn10 (so K=10) and then output 11 actions? But we argued that K=10 is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to avoid the initial detour by a different maneuver? \n\nWhat if we do:\n\nturn0: S -> stay at 0 (safe)\nturn1: U -> to 1 (freeway1 at turn1: safe)\nturn2: S -> stay at 1? But then we are at freeway1 at turn2: dangerous! -> collision.\n\nturn0: S\nturn1: S -> then at turn2:0 (safe)\nThen we are at 0 at turn2. Then we need to go up 9 times: from turn2 to turn10 (9 actions) to be at 9 at turn11. Then we need 11 actions to get to 9 at turn11, and then one more at turn11: total 12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a down move later? But that would only add more steps.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut note: we could be at freeway3 at turn4? We avoided that because we were at freeway3 at turn5, which is safe.\n\nBut what if we try to be at freeway3 at turn4? \n\nTo be at freeway3 at turn4: we must be at y=3 at the beginning of turn4.\n\nHow to get there from 0 in 4 actions? We must have net +3: so 3 U and 1 extra move (S or D). But we also have to avoid collisions at the intermediate turns.\n\nWe must avoid:\n  at turn1: if we are at 1 -> freeway1: safe at turn1 (only dangerous at T=2)\n  at turn2: we must not be at freeway1 (dangerous at T=2) or freeway2 (dangerous at T=2) -> so we must be at 0 or 3? But we cannot be at 3 at turn2 (only 0,1,2). So we must be at 0 at turn2.\n\nThen from turn2: we have two actions to go to 3: \n  turn2: U (from 0 to 1) -> turn3:1 (freeway1 at turn3: safe because T=3)\n  turn3: U (to 2) -> turn4:2, not 3.\n\n  turn2: U (to1)\n  turn3: U (to2) -> then at turn4:3? No, because at the beginning of turn4 we are at 2, then we take an action to go to 3 at turn5.\n\nSo at turn4, we are at 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at 3 at turn4.\n\nHence, we cannot be at freeway3 at turn4 (which is dangerous) because we are at freeway2 at turn4.\n\nBut we already avoided that by being at freeway2 at turn4 (which is safe).\n\nSo the path we have is valid and minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nH=12, and the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have 12 turns: from turn0 to turn11. So H=12.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> that is 12 actions.\n\nIn the boxed answer, we write:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut wait, the initial turn is t1=0, so we write:\n\nTurn 0: a_0 = U\nTurn 1: a_1 = D\n...\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so we write:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut we must ensure that at turn11 we are at 9. How do we know? \n\nAt turn10, we are at 8? Then we take U at turn10: so at turn11 we are at 9. Then at turn11 we take S, which keeps us at 9.\n\nBut the problem requires to be at 9 at turn11? Actually, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11? How did we get there? By the action at turn10: U, which moved us from 8 (at turn10) to 9 (at turn11). Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn11, as required.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars\", and we checked every freeway we were on at the time we were on it.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nIs there a shorter path? We argued that we must be at 0 at turn2, and then 9 more up moves from turn2 to turn10 (9 actions) to be at 9 at turn11. So 11 actions to get to 9 at turn11, and then the 12th action is at turn11. So no.\n\nBut what if we do:\n\nAt turn0: U (to1)\nturn1: D (to0)\nturn2: U (to1)\nturn3: U (to2)\nturn4: U (to3)\n...\n\nBut then at turn4 we are at 3? But we need to be at 9 at turn11, so we do 9 up moves from turn2 to turn10? Then at turn10: we are at 1 + 8 = 9? \n\nWait: from turn2: at0, then \n  turn2: U ->1\n  turn3: U ->2\n  turn4: U ->3\n  turn5: U ->4\n  turn6: U ->5\n  turn7: U ->6\n  turn8: U ->7\n  turn9: U ->8\n  turn10: U ->9\n\nSo at turn11 we are at9. Then we take S at turn11.\n\nSame as above: 11 up moves? But we did U at turn0, then D at turn1, then 9 up moves: total 11 up moves? But we only need 9 net up moves. But we did 11 up and 1 down: net 10 up moves -> we would be at 10? But we clamp to 9.\n\nWait: we start at0.\nAfter turn0: U ->1\nturn1: D ->0\nturn2: U ->1\nturn3: U ->2\nturn4: U ->3\nturn5: U ->4\nturn6: U ->5\nturn7: U ->6\nturn8: U ->7\nturn9: U ->8\nturn10: U ->9\n\nSo at turn11 we are at9. And we did 10 up moves and 1 down move? Net 9 up moves. Yes.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn0: U\nTurn1: D\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S\n\nThis is 12 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at turn10: we are at8? Then we take U to go to9 at turn11.\n\nWe must check freeway8 at turn10: we are at freeway8 at turn10? Yes, because y10=8. Then we check the cars on freeway8 at turn10: \n  car1: (48,37,right,4) -> at T=10: [37+4*10, 48+4*10] = [77,88] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: (0,-11,right,4) -> at T=10: [-11+40, 0+40] = [29,40] -> 0 not in.\n  So safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have 12 turns. Is there a path with H=11? \n\nSuppose we try to be at 9 at turn10 (so that we output actions from turn0 to turn10: 11 actions). Then we are at9 at the beginning of turn10? \n\nBut we must be at 0 at turn2. Then from turn2 to turn10: 9 actions? We need to go from 0 to9: that requires 9 up moves. Then we would be at9 at turn11, not turn10.\n\nWe can be at9 at turn10 only if we have taken 9 net up moves by turn10 (i.e., from turn0 to turn9). But we had to do a down move at turn1, so the net up moves by turn9: we did one up, one down, and then 8 up moves? Then net 8 up moves -> at8 at turn10. Then we need one more up move at turn10 to get to9 at turn11. \n\nSo we cannot be at9 at turn10.\n\nHence, minimal H is 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to y = 8, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\) is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 0**: Move up (U) to y = 1. At turn 1, the player is at freeway 1. The cars on freeway 1 are dangerous only at turn 2, so it is safe.\n- **Turn 1**: Move down (D) to y = 0. This avoids being at freeway 2 at turn 2 (which is dangerous) and resets to a safe, non-freeway position.\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to y = 1. At turn 3, freeway 1 is safe since turn 3 is not dangerous (only turn 2 is).\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to y = 2. At turn 4, freeway 2 is safe since turn 4 is not dangerous (only turn 2 is).\n- **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to y = 3. At turn 5, freeway 3 is safe since turn 5 is not dangerous (only turns 1 and 4 are).\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to y = 4. At turn 6, freeway 4 is safe since turn 6 is not dangerous (only turns 1 and 4 are).\n- **Turn 6**: Move up (U) to y = 5. Freeway 5 is safe at all turns.\n- **Turn 7**: Move up (U) to y = 6. Freeway 6 is safe at all turns.\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to y = 7. Freeway 7 is safe at all turns.\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to y = 8. At turn 10, freeway 8 is safe since turn 10 is not dangerous (only turns 1 and 2 are).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to y = 9. The player reaches the goal at the beginning of turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Stay (S) to remain at y = 9, as the goal is already achieved.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at the beginning of turn 11 (i.e., after 11 actions) and avoids all collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 during the journey. The action at turn 11 is included to complete the sequence of \\(H = 12\\) actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 1, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, with actions U (up), D (down), S (stay). We must avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the same as the row) and at the same time, for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: when moving, at turn T, if we move to a new row, then at that exact turn T we are still on the old row. So at turn T, we are on row y_T, and then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + action. Thus, at turn T, we only care about the cars on row y_T.\n\nWe start at turn 1 at (0,1). We are on row 1 at turn 1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn 1 (current turn). We need to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nCar update:\nFor a car at turn 1 (t1=1), at a future turn T (T>=1), the car's span is:\n  - Left-moving: [h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1)]   [since T-t1 = T-1]\n  - Right-moving: [tau + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n\nBut note: the representation for left and right is different in the input:\n  - Left-moving: the input gives (head, tail) as (h, tau) and the car is moving left. The head is the front? But note the update: for left, the car moves left so the entire span shifts left by s per turn.\n  - Right-moving: the input gives (head, tail) as (tau, h)? Actually, the input says for right: [Span(t1)= [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the initial head is h and tail is tau? But in the input for right, they write (head, tail) as (h, tau) but then define the span as [tau, h]? \n\nLooking at the input for right-moving cars in the table:\n  Example: freeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? But wait the input says (head, tail) = (-36, -47). \n\nClarification from the update rule:\n  For a right-moving car: the span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning from tail to head? But note the update rule says:\n      Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, they list the car as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, the head is the front and the tail is the back. The car moves right so both head and tail increase.\n\nSo the span at time t1 is [tail, head]? Actually, the update rule says: for right, the span at t1 is [tau, h] and then it moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the initial tail is tau and head is h.\n\nBut in the input, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So for the right-moving car (head, tail) = (h, tau). That means the span at t1 is [tau, h] (which is [tail, head]). Similarly, for left: the input gives (head, tail) = (h, tau) and the span at t1 is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo we have to be careful: the input for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed). The head is the front of the car, tail is the back.\n\nTherefore, for a car (head, tail, direction, speed) at t1:\n  - If direction is left: the span at time T is [head - s*(T-1), tail - s*(T-1)] (since the entire car shifts left by s per turn, so both head and tail decrease by s*(T-1)).\n  - If direction is right: the span at time T is [tail + s*(T-1), head + s*(T-1)] (because the entire car shifts right by s per turn, so both tail and head increase by s*(T-1)).\n\nBut note: the update rule for right says: [Span(t1)= [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. Here, tau is the tail and h is the head. So at t1, the span is [tail, head]. Then at T, it becomes [tail + s*(T-1), head + s*(T-1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left: [head, tail] at t1, then [head - s*(T-1), tail - s*(T-1)] at T.\n\nSo we can compute for each car on each freeway, at a future turn T, the interval of x-coordinates that the car occupies.\n\nWe are only concerned with whether the car's span at turn T includes 0? Because the player is at x=0.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, at turn T, we need to check if 0 is in the interval [L, R] (for left) or [L, R] (for right) at that turn.\n\nNow, the freeways we care about are from 1 to 8. The player starts at row 1 and must go to row 9 (but row 9 is the goal and there are no cars on row 9? because the freeways with cars are 1..8). So we don't have to worry about row 0? because the player can only be at rows 0..9, but row 0 is the bottom and row 9 is the top. However, we start at row 1 and goal is row 9.\n\nThe player can go down to row 0? But the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we can go to row 0. But note: if we are at row 0 and do D, we stay at 0. Similarly, at row 9, we cannot go up.\n\nBut the goal is (0,9). So we must end at row 9.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. Freeway 0 and 9 are not mentioned? Actually, the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So when we are on row 0 or 9, there are no cars. But note: we start at row 1, and we are at row 1 at turn 1. Then we move.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 1 (t1) to turn 1+H-1 such that at the end of turn 1+H-1 we are at row 9.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space search. The state is (turn, row). But note: the turn number matters because the cars move over time.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move at constant speed and we are moving one row per turn (or staying). The minimal H would be at least 8 (from row 1 to row 9, we need 8 up moves). But we might have to wait (use S or even D) to avoid cars.\n\nWe are to minimize H, so we want as few turns as possible.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (time, row). But note: time can be large? However, we can bound the time because the cars are periodic? Actually, the cars move at integer speeds and the grid is infinite in x, but we only care about whether 0 is in the span at a particular turn.\n\nBut note: the car spans are linear functions of time. So for each car, the condition 0 in [L(T), R(T)] is a linear inequality. And since the cars move continuously, the intervals are moving.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway and for each turn in a reasonable horizon (say, up to 20 turns) the set of x=0 that is covered by any car? Actually, we only care about the time when the player is on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 1 (current) until we reach row 9.\n\nWe start at row 1 at turn 1.\n\nWe consider actions: U, D, S. But note: we want minimal turns, so we prefer moving up. However, sometimes we have to wait.\n\nWe must check for each turn T and the row we are at during that turn (y_T) whether there is a car on that row (freeway) such that at turn T, 0 is in the car's span.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at each future turn.\n\nLet me write down the cars for each freeway at turn 1 and then compute for future turns.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (head=12, tail=47, left, 36). But wait, that doesn't make sense because if head=12 and tail=47, then tail>head? and the car is left-moving? Actually, for a left-moving car, the head should be the front, so if the car is moving left, the head should be the rightmost? But the update rule: the span at t1 is [head, tail] -> [head - s*(T-1), tail - s*(T-1)].\n\nBut if head=12 and tail=47, then the initial span is [12,47]. But 12<47, so that's an interval of 35 units? Then at time T, it becomes [12-36*(T-1), 47-36*(T-1)].\n\nBut note: the car is moving left, so the entire car is shifting left. The head at time T is 12-36*(T-1) and tail is 47-36*(T-1). But since 12<47, the head is the left end? Actually, the problem says for left: the span at t1 is [h, tau] and then moves to [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)]. So the initial head is the left end? But typically, we think of the head as the front. For a left-moving car, the front is the leftmost? Actually, if the car is moving left, then the front (head) is at a smaller x than the tail? That seems odd.\n\nLooking at the example: freeway 3 has a right-moving car: (-36, -47, right, 12). Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. Then at time T, it becomes [-47+12*(T-1), -36+12*(T-1)]. This makes sense: the car is moving right, so the entire interval shifts right.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36). Then the span at t1 is [head, tail] = [12,47]. Then at time T: [12-36*(T-1), 47-36*(T-1)]. But 12<47, so the car occupies [12,47] at t1. Then at T=1: [12,47]. At T=2: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]. At T=3: [-60,-25].\n\nWe are concerned with whether 0 is in the interval.\n\nFreeway 1: \n  T=1: [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n  T=2: [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> collision at T=2 on freeway 1? but only if the player is on freeway 1 at turn 2.\n\nBut note: the player starts at turn 1 on freeway 1. Then at turn 1, we are safe (0 not in [12,47]). Then we take an action. If we move at turn 1, then at turn 2 we will be on freeway 0, 1, or 2? \n\nWait, the player update: \n  at turn 1: we are at row 1.\n  we choose an action a1 (at turn 1) -> then at turn 2, we are at row 1 + delta.\n\nBut at turn 1, we are at row 1. Then we choose an action. The action affects the row at the next turn. So at turn 1, we are on row 1. Then we choose a1, and then at turn 2, we are on row y2 = y1 + delta.\n\nTherefore, at turn 2, we are on row y2. And we have to check the cars on row y2 at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 1, we are on row 1 and we check the cars on row 1 at turn 1 -> safe.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway and for each turn T (from 1 to, say, 20) the safety: safe if no car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe'll create a 2D array: safe[T][k] for T in [1,20] and k in [1,8] (freeways 1..8) that is True if at turn T, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on k has 0 in its span at T).\n\nBut note: each freeway may have multiple cars. We must check all cars on that freeway.\n\nLet me compute the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car: (12,47,left,36)\n  At turn T: [12-36*(T-1), 47-36*(T-1)]\n  We need 0 in [12-36*(T-1), 47-36*(T-1)]?\n  => 12-36*(T-1) <= 0 <= 47-36*(T-1)\n\n  Solve:\n    Lower bound: 12-36*(T-1) <= 0 -> 36*(T-1) >= 12 -> T-1 >= 12/36 = 1/3 -> T>=2 (since T integer)\n    Upper bound: 0 <= 47-36*(T-1) -> 36*(T-1) <= 47 -> T-1 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305 -> T<=2.305 -> T<=2 (since integer)\n\n  So only at T=2: the interval is [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> unsafe at T=2 for freeway 1.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 1 is safe at T=1, unsafe at T=2, and for T>=3: \n      T=3: [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) -> same as above: unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,12) -> for right: [tail+s*(T-1), head+s*(T-1)] = [-47+12*(T-1), -36+12*(T-1)]\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [tail=-11, head=0] -> [-11+12*(T-1), 0+12*(T-1)]\n  Car3: (36,25,right,12) -> [tail=25, head=36] -> [25+12*(T-1), 36+12*(T-1)]\n\n  We need to check if 0 is in any of these at turn T.\n\n  Car1: [-47+12*(T-1), -36+12*(T-1)]\n      Let x = T-1.\n      We need: -47+12x <= 0 <= -36+12x\n      Lower: -47+12x<=0 -> 12x<=47 -> x<=47/12≈3.916 -> x<=3\n      Upper: 0<=-36+12x -> 12x>=36 -> x>=3\n      So at x=3: T=4 -> interval: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [-11,0]. So 0 is included? Yes, because the upper bound is 0. So at T=4, Car1 has 0 in its span.\n\n  But wait: the interval is [L, R] for right? The update rule says: for right, the span is [tail+s*(T-t1), head+s*(T-t1)]. And we are including the endpoints? The problem doesn't specify, but typically we assume closed intervals. So if the car is from L to R, then it occupies [L, R]. Therefore, 0 is in [-11,0] -> yes.\n\n  So Car1 at T=4: unsafe.\n\n  Car2: [-11+12*(T-1), 0+12*(T-1)] = [12*(T-1)-11, 12*(T-1)]\n      We need: 12*(T-1)-11 <= 0 <= 12*(T-1)\n      Lower: 12x-11<=0 -> 12x<=11 -> x<=11/12<1 -> T-1<1 -> T<2 -> only T=1? \n        At T=1: [12*0-11,0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes. So at T=1, Car2 has 0 in its span.\n\n      But we are at turn 1 and on freeway 3? At turn 1, we are at row 1, not 3. So we don't care about freeway 3 at turn 1 for the player? But if the player is on freeway 3 at turn 1, then it would be unsafe. But we are at row 1 at turn 1.\n\n      So for freeway 3 at T=1: unsafe because of Car2.\n\n      Now, what about other T?\n        T=1: [ -11, 0] -> unsafe.\n        T=2: [12*1-11, 12*1] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        T=3: [24-11,24] = [13,24] -> safe.\n        T=4: [36-11,36] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n  Car3: [25+12*(T-1), 36+12*(T-1)]\n      This interval is always above 25 (for T>=1) -> 0 never in -> safe.\n\n  Therefore, for freeway 3: \n      T=1: unsafe (because of Car2)\n      T=2: safe\n      T=3: safe\n      T=4: unsafe (because of Car1)\n\n  So freeway 3 is safe only at T=2 and T=3? Actually, T=1: unsafe, T=2: safe, T=3: safe, T=4: unsafe, and for T>=5: \n      Car1: at T=5: [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> safe.\n      Car2: at T=5: [12*4-11, 48] = [37,48] -> safe.\n      So T>=5: safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? The table says same cars: \n  (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\n  So same as freeway 3: \n      T=1: unsafe\n      T=2: safe\n      T=3: safe\n      T=4: unsafe\n      T>=5: safe\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  (60,49,right,12) -> wait, head=60, tail=49? But for right, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [49,60]? Then at T: [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)]. But 49+12*(T-1) is always >=49, so 0 never in -> safe for this car.\n\n  (12,1,right,12) -> [tail=1, head=12] -> [1+12*(T-1), 12+12*(T-1)]\n      We need: 1+12*(T-1) <= 0 <= 12+12*(T-1)\n      Lower: 1+12x <=0 -> 12x<=-1 -> impossible? because x>=0. So 0 is never <= the lower bound? Actually, the interval is [1+12x, 12+12x] and since 1+12x>=1, then 0 is never in. So safe.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 5 is always safe? \n\n  But wait: the car (12,1,right,12): head=12, tail=1 -> so the car is from 1 to 12 at t1? Then at T, [1+12*(T-1), 12+12*(T-1)]. For T=1: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe. T=2: [13,24] -> safe. So yes, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5: always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  (52,41,right,4) -> [tail=41, head=52] -> [41+4*(T-1), 52+4*(T-1)] -> always above 41 -> safe.\n  (4,-7,right,4) -> [tail=-7, head=4] -> [-7+4*(T-1), 4+4*(T-1)]\n      We need: -7+4*(T-1) <= 0 <= 4+4*(T-1)\n      The upper bound: 0<=4+4*(T-1) -> always true for T>=1? because 4+4*(T-1)>=4>0.\n      Lower: -7+4*(T-1)<=0 -> 4*(T-1)<=7 -> T-1<=7/4=1.75 -> T<=2.75 -> so T=1,2.\n\n        T=1: [-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n        T=2: [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n        T=3: [-7+8,4+8] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        T=4: [5,16] -> safe.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 8: \n      T=1: unsafe\n      T=2: unsafe\n      T>=3: safe\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=2\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=2\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=1, T=4\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=1, T=4\nFreeway 5: always safe\nFreeway 6: always safe\nFreeway 7: always safe\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=1, T=2\n\nWe start at turn 1 at row 1.\n\nAt turn 1, we are on row 1. Freeway 1: safe? at T=1 -> safe (because freeway1 unsafe only at T=2). So we can be at row 1 at turn 1.\n\nWe need to get to row 9. The minimal moves: 8 Ups. But we might have to wait.\n\nWe can model the states: (time, row) and the path.\n\nWe want the minimal time (number of turns) to reach row 9.\n\nWe start at (1,1).\n\nAt each state (t, y), we can choose action U, D, S (if within bounds). Then the next state is (t+1, y') where:\n  if U: y' = min(9, y+1)\n  if D: y' = max(0, y-1)\n  if S: y' = y\n\nBut we must check: at time t (the current turn) we are on row y, and we are safe? Actually, when we are at state (t,y), we have already been at row y at time t. We must have been safe at time t. Then we choose an action for turn t, which will lead us to row y' at time t+1.\n\nBut note: the safety check for the current state (t,y) must be done: if the freeway y is unsafe at time t, then we cannot be there.\n\nSo we must ensure that when we are at (t,y), then the freeway y is safe at time t.\n\nWe start at (1,1): freeway 1 at time 1 is safe -> OK.\n\nWe then choose an action at turn 1, which will lead to a new row at time 2.\n\nWe need to know the safety at time 2 for the new row.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nLet d[t][y] = the minimal time (number of turns from start) to be at row y at time t. But we care about the entire sequence.\n\nAlternatively, we can use BFS in the state (t,y) and record the previous action.\n\nWe are to minimize the total turns H such that at turn (1+H-1) we are at row 9.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Let t_min = 1, and we want to reach (t,9) for some t>=1.\n\n  The minimal t is 1+8 = 9? (if we go up 8 times).\n\nBut we might have to wait, so we consider t from 1 up to, say, 20.\n\nWe'll generate states for t from 1 to 20.\n\nWe'll create a visited array to avoid cycles? But since we can go down and up, we might cycle. However, we are minimizing the time, and we can bound the row (0..9) and time (we set a limit). We want the minimal time, so we do BFS by time.\n\nWe start:\n\n  t=1: y=1 -> safe.\n\nThen from (1,1), we can do:\n\n  U: then at turn 2, we are at y=2. Check freeway 2 at time 2: unsafe! (from summary: freeway2 unsafe at T=2) -> so we cannot go to (2,2) because at time 2 we are on freeway2 and it's unsafe.\n\n  D: then at turn 2, we are at y=0. But y=0: no freeway (no cars) -> safe. So (2,0) is safe.\n\n  S: then at turn 2, we are at y=1. Check freeway1 at time2: unsafe! (freeway1 unsafe at T=2) -> not safe.\n\nSo at turn1, only D is safe? Then we go to (2,0).\n\nNow from (2,0): we are at time2, row0. Then we can choose actions:\n\n  U: then at time3, row1 -> check freeway1 at time3: safe (because freeway1 unsafe only at T=2) -> safe. So (3,1) is safe.\n  D: then row0 again -> safe -> (3,0)\n  S: row0 -> safe -> (3,0)\n\nWe continue.\n\nBut note: we want to get to row9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can use BFS (queue by time) and we break when we first reach row9.\n\nWe'll keep track of the time and the row, and the path.\n\nSince we are minimizing the total turns (H = total turns from start to the turn we reach 9) and H = (current time - 1) + 1? Actually, we start at turn1 and we do actions at turn1, turn2, ... until the last action at turn H-1, and then at turn H we are at row9.\n\nBut note: the number of actions is H-1? Actually, the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning from t=0 to H-1, so H actions? \n\nBut the goal is reached at the end of the last action, i.e., after H actions we are at row9.\n\nBut our state (t,y) is at the beginning of turn t? Actually, we are at (t,y) meaning at turn t we are at row y. Then we choose an action for turn t, which leads to row y' at turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn T, we must have chosen an action at turn T-1 that brought us to row9.\n\nWe want the minimal T such that we are at row9 at turn T? Then the number of actions is T-1? But the problem says: minimal number of turns H, and the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nActually, the problem states: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning H actions? \n\nBut then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at row9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nRe-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo at the turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our state: we are at (turn, row). So we want to be at (t1+H-1, 9). \n\nWe start at (1,1). So we are at time1 (turn1). Then we do H-1 actions? because the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? \n\nBut note: the actions are applied at turns: \n  a_{t1} (which is the action at turn1) -> leads to turn2 state.\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} (the last action) is applied at turn (t1+H-1) -> leads to state at turn (t1+H).\n\nBut the problem says we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be before the last action? \n\nClarification: \n\n  At turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1). \n  Then we apply action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> then we get to state at turn t1+1.\n  ...\n  We apply action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then we get to state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1+0} = a_{t1} (at turn t1)\n  a_{t1+1} (at turn t1+1)\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1)\n\nThen after these H actions, we are at turn t1+H. But the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state at turn t1 is before any action? And then the first action is at turn t1, leading to turn t1+1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis suggests that we are at (0,9) at the turn immediately after the last action? Actually, no: the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at the state for turn t1+H-1? \n\nI think there is confusion in the indexing.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe actions are taken at the turns: \n  At the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,1). \n  Then we take action a_{t1} (at turn t1) -> this updates the state to (0, y_{t1+1}) at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n  ...\n  Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1) -> this updates the state to (0, y_{t1+H}) at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, i.e., after H-2 actions? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take the action at turn t and then immediately after the action we are at the new state at the same turn? \n\nBut the dynamics say: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\", so the new state is at turn t+1.\n\nThe problem states: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis must mean: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut then we have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? That would be H-1 actions. \n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1? That would be H actions. \n\nAlternatively, the indexing of the actions: \n  t=0: corresponds to turn t1+0 = t1 -> action at turn t1\n  t=1: turn t1+1\n  ...\n  t=H-1: turn t1+H-1\n\nBut then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is determined. \n\nBut the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, not at turn t1+H. \n\nThis suggests that the last action is not needed? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. \n\nLooking at the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nAnd initially at turn t1, we are at (0,y_{t1}) = (0,1). \n\nSo we start at turn t1 at (0,1), and we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis means we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nThe number of actions would be H-1. \n\nBut the sequence of actions is indexed from t=0 to H-1? That would be H actions. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take an action at turn t and then immediately at the same turn we are at the new state? But the update rule says y_{t+1} = ... \n\nRe-read the player update: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \"\n\nSo the state at turn t+1 depends on the action at turn t. \n\nTherefore, we start at turn t1: state (0,1). \n  After action a_{t1} at turn t1, we are at state (0,y_{t1+1}) at turn t1+1.\n  ...\n  After action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we are at state (0,y_{t1+H}) at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which would be the state before the last action. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is a discrepancy. \n\nLooking at the example in the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the answer format lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut according to the dynamics, at turn t1+H-1, we are at row y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, which will determine y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9, and then we don't care about the next state? \n\nBut the last action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at turn t1+H-1, but then after that action we are at row y_{t1+H} which might not be 9. \n\nThis doesn't make sense. \n\nI think the problem means that we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we do not require any action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes actions up to turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of turns H might be the total number of turns from start to the turn we arrive at 9, and the actions are from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? \n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the minimal example: \n  Start at (0,1) at turn1. \n  If we could go up 8 times in a row, then after 8 actions (at turn9) we would be at row9. \n  Then we would be at row9 at turn9. \n  So H-1 = 8? and then the last action is at turn8 (which is t1+7) -> then the sequence has 8 actions: turns1 to turn8. \n  And then at turn9 we are at row9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n  Here, t1=1, so t1+H-1 = 9 -> H-1 = 8? -> H=9. \n  Then the number of actions is H = 9? But we took 8 actions. \n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nUnless the turns are counted differently.\n\nAnother possibility: \n  Turn1: we start at row1. \n  Action at turn1: U -> then at the beginning of turn2, we are at row2.\n  ...\n  Action at turn8: U -> then at the beginning of turn9, we are at row9.\n\n  Then we are at row9 at turn9. \n  So we have taken 8 actions (turn1 to turn8) and we are at row9 at turn9 = t1+8. \n  We want to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H. \n  So H = 9. \n  Then the number of turns H is 9, and the actions are for turns1 to turn8 (8 actions) but the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1=8? -> 9 actions? \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and after these H actions, we are at row9 at turn t1+H. \nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", not t1+H.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the goal is to be at row9 at the beginning of turn T, and the last action we took was at turn T-1. \nAnd we start at turn1 at row1. \nWe want to minimize T, the turn at which we are at row9. \nThen the number of turns H is T - 1 + 1 = T? But the problem calls H the minimal number of turns, and then we output actions for turn1 to turn T-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions? \n  If T is the turn we are at row9, then we have used T-1 actions (from turn1 to turn T-1). \n  So H = T-1? \n  Then the goal is to be at row9 at turn T = t1+H. \n  But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAfter re-thinking, I found a possible interpretation: \n  The \"turns\" H might include the starting turn. \n  We start at turn1 (which is one turn), and then we do actions for H-1 turns, so total turns from 1 to H (if we count the starting turn and the turns we do actions).\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we list H actions? \n\nGiven the answer format, it lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nBut then we would be at row9 after the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n This is the core of the confusion.\n\nSince the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways\", and the collision happens at turn T if we are on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAnd at the turn when we are at row9, we are on freeway9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nSo for the turn when we are at row9, we don't care about the cars.\n\nWe must ensure that for every turn from 1 to the turn before we reach 9, we are safe on the freeway we are on.\n\nTherefore, we want to minimize the turn T such that we are at row9 at turn T.\n\nThen the number of actions is T-1 (because we start at turn1 and then do actions at turn1,2,...,T-1 to get to turnT).\n\nBut the problem says the minimal number of turns H, and the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n If we let H = T ( the turn number when we are at 9), then the number of actions is H-1, and the sequence should be from turn1 to turn H-1, which is H-1 actions.\n\n This matches: the sequence has H-1 actions.\n\n But the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> this would be from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\n So if we have H-1 actions, then the indexing should be from t=0 to H-2.\n\nGiven the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  up to Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\n This is H actions.\n\n Therefore, if we need to do K actions, then H = K+1? \n\n Let me: \n   actions: turn1, turn2, ..., turnK -> K actions.\n   then at turn K+1 we are at row9.\n   so the turn when we are at row9 is turn K+1.\n   then the minimal K+1 is the turn number, but the problem's H is the number of turns, which would be K+1.\n\n   and the sequence has K actions, but the answer format requires H actions, which would be K+1 actions.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n Alternatively, the problem considers the starting turn as turn1 and then we do H actions from turn1 to turnH, and then at the next turn (turnH+1) we are at row9.\n\n But then the turn when we are at row9 is turnH+1, and the problem says to be at turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n So we are at row9 at turnH.\n\n This would require that after H actions, we are at row9 at turnH? \n\n But with H actions, we start at turn1 and do actions at turn1,2,...,H, then we are at row at turnH+1.\n\n To be at row9 at turnH, we must have gotten there by an action at turnH-1.\n\n So the number of actions to get to row9 at turnH is (H-1) actions.\n\n then the sequence of actions is for turns 1 to H-1: H-1 actions.\n\n but the answer format has H actions ( for turns1 to turn1+H-1 = turnH).\n\n This is one extra action.\n\n Given the confusion, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \n   We are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T.\n   We have control over actions at turns 1 to T-1.\n   The number of actions is T-1.\n   The minimal such T (>=1) is what we seek, and then H = T-1 is the number of actions? \n\n   but the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\n   So if T-1 = H, then T = H+1.\n\n   Then the problem's \"H\" is the number of actions.\n\n   and we are at row9 at turn (H+1).\n\n   But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\" = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n   So we would be at row9 at turn H, but then we only used H-1 actions.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n or: \n   We are at row9 at turn H ( the H-th turn), and we have used H-1 actions.\n\n   but the problem's sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n Given the time, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \n   We start at turn1 at row1.\n   We take actions at turn1, turn2, ..., turn (H-1) [ so H-1 actions].\n   Then at turnH, we are at row9.\n   Then the minimal H is the turn number when we are at row9.\n\n   and the number of actions is H-1.\n\n   But the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H ( which would be the turn number H), and then the sequence of actions is for turns 1 to H-1, which is H-1 actions.\n\n   However, the answer format says to list actions for turn1 to turnH-1, which is H-1 actions, but the indexing in the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\n This is off by one.\n\n Since the problem is from the user, and to move forward, I will output the actions for turns until the action that brings us to row9.\n\n We are at row9 at turn T.\n Then the actions are for turns 1 to T-1.\n The number of turns in the game until we are at row9 is T turns (including the starting turn).\n\n But the problem might call H = T.\n\n and the sequence has T-1 actions.\n\n but the answer format has a sequence of H actions.\n\n So if H = T, then we output T-1 actions? -> not matching.\n\n or if they want H = T-1, then the sequence has H actions = T-1 actions.\n\n and then the turn we are at row9 is turn (t1+H) = 1 + (T-1) = T, which is correct.\n\n So let's assume: \n   H = number of actions = T-1, where T is the turn at which we are at row9.\n   Then the sequence has H actions, for turns 1 to H ( since turn1 to turn1+H-1 = turn (1+H-1) = turnH, and H = number of actions).\n\n   and we are at row9 at turn H+1.\n\n   but the problem says \" at turn t1+H-1\" = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n   so we are at row9 at turnH, not turnH+1.\n\n Given the above, I think the safest is to and then output the actions that achieve row9 at the earliest turn T, and then the number of actions is T-1.\n\n and then let H = T-1, and output actions for turn1 to turn T-1.\n\n even though the problem might expect H to be the turn number, but the answer format only cares about the actions.\n\n We'll. the answer format is the actions, so we output the actions for turn1, turn2, ..., until the last action that made us reach row9.\n\n and then the minimal H would be the number of actions.\n\n in the. the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\n so if we have found a sequence of actions of length K that gets us to row9 at turn K+1, then we would output K actions, and say H = K.\n\n and then the turn we are at row9 is turn K+1, and the problem asks for turn t1+H-1 = 1+K-1 = K.\n\n so we would be at row9 at turn K+1, not at turnK.\n\n to be at row9 at turnK, we must have taken actions from turn1 to turnK-1, and then at turnK we are at row9.\n\n then the number of actions is K-1.\n\n then we would output H = K-1, and the sequence has K-1 actions.\n\n then the turn we are at row9 is turnK = 1 + (K-1) = K, and the problem's turn t1+H-1 = 1 + (K-1) - 1 = K-1, which is not matching.\n\n only if we output H = K, then turn t1+H-1 = 1+K-1 =K, and we are at row9 at turnK.\n\n so to be at row9 at turnK, we need to have taken K-1 actions.\n\n then we should output H = K, and the sequence should have H = K actions, but we only have K-1 actions.\n\n This is the core issue.\n\n Given the, I think the problem has a typo and it should be \"at turn t1+H\" or something else.\n\n or, in the dynamics, the state after an action is in the same turn? \n\n But the update rule says y_{t+1} = ...\n\n I think the intended meaning is: \n   at the turn when you take the last action, after taking it, you are at row9, and that is the last turn you act.\n\n and then you are at row9 at the next turn? but the problem says at the turn you take the action.\n\n or, the turn you take the action and the state are the same.\n\n To resolve, I will assume that the \n   We are at row9 at the turn after the last action.\n\n   and the problem's \" at turn t1+H-1\" is a typo, and it should be \" at turn t1+H\" .\n\n then: \n   actions: turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions) -> then at turn t1+H, we are at row9.\n\n   then the number of turns H is the number of actions.\n\n   and we minimize H.\n\n   and the turn at which we are at row9 is turn1+H.\n\n   and the problem might have meant to say \" at turn t1+H\" .\n\n Given the above, I will minimize the number of actions H such that after H actions, we are at row9 at turn1+H.\n\n and then output the actions for turn1 to turn1+H-1 (H actions).\n\n and the answer's H is that number.\n\n This is the most with the answer format.\n\n So in state (t,y), we are at turn t, row y.\n Then we take an action a_t, and then at turn t+1, we are at row y'.\n\n We want to achieve at some turn T = 1+H, we are at row9.\n\n So we start at (1,1), and we want to reach (1+H,9) for some H>=0.\n\n We minimize H.\n\n We are safe at (t,y) if at turn t, freeway y is safe.\n\n We with to \n   minimize H, \n   and find actions for turn1 to turn1+H-1.\n\n We'll search for the minimal H such that there is a path from (1,1) to (1+H,9) safe along the way.\n\n We can use BFS over (t,y) for t from 1 upwards.\n\n We start at (1,1) with H=0 (actions so far=0, and we are at row9? -> no).\n\n Then we consider actions.\n\n We are safe at (1,1) -> freeway1 at turn1 is safe.\n\n Then we do action at turn1, and we go to (2,y1) where y1 = 1+ (0,1, or -1) as long as in [0,9].\n\n and then we must be safe at (2,y1).\n\n then at turn2, we are at (2,y1) and safe.\n\n then we do action at turn2, ...\n\n until we are at (t,9) for some t.\n\n then H = t - 1 (number of actions = t-1).\n\n and the actions are for turn1 to turn t-1.\n\n But we want to output for turns turn1 to turn1+H-1 = turn (1 + (t-1) - 1) = turn t-1.\n\n and we have actions for turn1 to turn t-1: that's t-1 actions, which is H.\n\n so we output them.\n\n Therefore, we do BFS and when we reach (t,9) for the first time, then the number of actions is H = t-1.\n\n and we output the actions.\n\n We start at (1,1) with path [].\n\n We then try actions U, D, S.\n\n We only visit a state (t,y) if we haven't been there with a smaller or equal t? But we are BFS by t.\n\n We'll do BFS by the turn t.\n\n We generate states in increasing t.\n\n We we are at (t,y), and we haven't reached (t,9) for any t.\n\n We stop when we first reach (t,9) for some t.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n We create a queue: (t, y, actions) \n\n 1. (1,1, []) -> safe.\n\n   Then try:\n        U: y' = min(9,1+1)=2 -> next state (2,2). But freeway2 at turn2: unsafe! -> skip.\n        D: y' = max(0,1-1)=0 -> (2,0). Freeway0: safe (no cars) -> new state.\n        S: y' =1 -> (2,1). Freeway1 at turn2: unsafe! -> skip.\n\n   So only (2,0) with action 'D'. Path: ['D']\n\n 2. (2,0, ['D']) \n        U: y' = 0+1=1 -> (3,1). Freeway1 at turn3: safe (only unsafe at turn2) -> new state.\n        D: y' =0 -> (3,0). safe.\n        S: y'=0 -> (3,0). safe.\n\n   So states: (3,1) with path ['D','U'] and (3,0) with ['D','D'] and ['D','S'].\n\n 3. Let's consider (3,1, ['D','U'])\n        U: y'=1+1=2 -> (4,2). Freeway2 at turn4: \n             freeway2: only unsafe at T=2 -> safe at T=4.\n             -> safe.\n        D: y'=0 -> (4,0) -> safe.\n        S: y'=1 -> (4,1). Freeway1 at turn4: safe.\n        So we have three states.\n\n   Also (3,0, ['D','D'] or ['D','S']):\n        U: (4,1) -> safe.\n        D: (4,0) -> safe.\n        S: (4,0) -> safe.\n\n   So at level 4, we have (4,2), (4,0) from (3,1) and (4,1) from (3,1) and (3,0), and (4,0) from (3,0).\n\n   We are not at 9 yet.\n\n 4. We continue.\n\n   We want to go to row9 as fast as possible.\n\n   Let's try to move up from (4,2) ( from the (3,1) branch with actions ['D','U','U'] for turn1,2,3)\n\n        (4,2): \n          U: (5,3) -> freeway3 at turn5: safe (because freeway3 unsafe only at T=1,4 -> safe at T=5) -> safe.\n          then (5,3)\n\n        (4,1) ( from (3,0) with actions ['D','D','U'] or from (3,1) with ['D','U','S']? not in our current, but we have (4,1) from (3,0) by 'U' or from (3,1) by 'D' or 'S'? \n          Actually, from (3,0): \n               U: (4,1) -> path (e.g., ['D','D','U'] if from ['D','D'] or ['D','S','U'] if from ['D','S'])\n          then from (4,1):\n               U: (5,2) -> freeway2 at turn5: safe.\n               D: (5,0) -> safe.\n               S: (5,1) -> freeway1 at turn5: safe.\n\n   So many states.\n\n   We need to reach row9. The fastest is to go up as much as possible.\n\n   But we have to avoid unsafe turns.\n\n   The unsafe freeways by turn:\n\n        turn1: freeway3,4,8\n        turn2: freeway1,2,8\n        turn3: freeway1,2 are safe, freeway3,4 are safe (because T=3 is safe for them), freeway5,6,7 always safe, freeway8: safe at T>=3.\n        turn4: freeway3,4 unsafe.\n        turn5: all safe? \n             freeway1: safe for T>=3\n             freeway2: safe for T>=3\n             freeway3: safe for T>=5\n             freeway4: safe for T>=5\n             freeway8: safe for T>=3\n\n        so at turn5, all freeways are safe.\n\n   Therefore, if we can be at row>=1 at turn5, then we can go up without any risk from turn5 onward.\n\n   The minimal actions to row9: from row1 at turn1, to row9 at turn? \n\n   The fastest: \n        turn1: start at 1.\n        turn2: \n        turn3: \n        turn4: \n        turn5: \n        turn6: \n        turn7: \n        turn8: \n        turn9: \n        turn10: 9.\n\n   So if we go up 8 times, at turn9 we would be at row9.\n\n   But can we do that? \n        We have to avoid unsafe states in the first 4 turns.\n\n   We are at row1 at turn1 -> safe.\n        action U: turn2 at row2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn2 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n        action D: turn2 at row0 -> safe.\n        then from row0 at turn2: \n             action U: turn3 at row1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn3: safe) -> \n             then from row1 at turn3: \n                  action U: turn4 at row2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn4: safe) -> \n                  then action U: turn5 at row3 -> safe.\n                  then from row3 at turn5, we can do U five times: \n                        turn5:3 -> turn6:4, turn7:5, turn8:6, turn9:7, turn10:8, turn11:9.\n\n        total actions: from turn1 to turn10 -> 10 actions? and then at turn11 we are at row9.\n\n        But we want to be at row9 at turn11, so actions for turn1 to turn10 -> 10 actions.\n\n        is there a faster way? \n\n   Alternatively, from (2,0) at turn2, \n        action U: (3,1) -> safe.\n        then at (3,1), action U: (4,2) -> safe.\n        then at (4,2), action U: (5,3) -> safe.\n        then at (5,3), we can do 6 Ups: \n             turn5:3 -> turn6:4, turn7:5, turn8:6, turn9:7, turn10:8, turn11:9.\n        also 10 actions.\n\n   But note: at (4,2) we can do more than one step per turn? no, only one.\n\n   Can we be higher than 3 at turn5? \n        We are at row0 at turn2.\n        then to get to row3 at turn5: \n             from turn2 (0) to turn5 (3): 3 steps, so we need 3 Ups. \n        that's: turn2->3: 0->1, turn3->4:1->2, turn4->5:2->3.\n\n   So we are at row3 at turn5.\n\n   Then from there, we need 6 Ups to get to 9: at turn11.\n\n   total actions: 1 (at turn1) + 3 ( turns2,3,4) + 6 (turns5 to 10) = 10 actions.\n\n   We are at row9 at turn11.\n\n   But is there a way to be at a higher row at turn5? \n\n        turn1: start at 1.\n        turn1 action: D -> to 0 at turn2.\n        turn2 action: U -> to 1 at turn3.\n        turn3 action: U -> to 2 at turn4.\n        turn4 action: U -> to 3 at turn5.\n\n        only row3.\n\n   if at turn1 we do S: but not safe at turn2 on row1.\n\n   or at turn1: D, then turn2: D or S -> still at 0 at turn3, then we can do U at turn3: to 1 at turn4, then U at turn4: to 2 at turn5. -> only row2 at turn5.\n\n   then from row2 at turn5, we need 7 Ups -> 7 actions, arrive at turn12 at row9.\n\n   even more.\n\n   So 10 actions.\n\n   But is there a way to avoid going down? \n\n   We have to avoid freeway2 at turn2, so we cannot be at row2 at turn2.\n\n   So we must leave row1 at turn1.\n\n   only down is safe.\n\n   So we have to go down.\n\n   Then the earliest is 10 actions.\n\n   But is there a way to then catch up? \n\n   for example, after turn5, we are at row3, and we need to go to row9, which is 6 steps, so 6 actions, turns 5 to 10, then at turn11 at row9.\n\n   So 10 actions.\n\n   But note: at turn5, we are at row3, and we can do more than one up per turn? no.\n\n   However, we might use row0 to wait? but waiting at row0 doesn't help because we want to go up.\n\n   So the minimal actions is 10.\n\n   But let me double-check if we can be at row4 at turn5.\n\n        turn1: D to 0.\n        turn2: U to 1.\n        turn3: U to 2.\n        turn4: U to 3.\n        turn5: then we can do U to 4.\n        but then at turn5, we are at row4 after the action? no, at the next turn.\n        at the beginning of turn5, we are at row3. then we do U at turn5, and at turn6 we are at row4.\n\n        so at turn5, we are at row3.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal actions to row9 is 10.\n\n   But is there a shorter path by going to a freeway that is safe at a given turn and then going up faster? \n\n   For example, at turn4, freeway3 and 4 are unsafe, so we must avoid being on freeway3 or 4 at turn4.\n\n   In our path, we are at row2 at turn4, which is freeway2, safe.\n\n   then at turn5, we are at row3 (freeway3) -> turn5: freeway3 is safe (because unsafe only at turn1 and turn4).\n\n   so it is safe.\n\n   Therefore, the actions are:\n\n        turn1: D\n        turn2: U\n        turn3: U\n        turn4: U\n        turn5: U\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n\n   Then at turn11, we are at row9.\n\n   So the sequence has 10 actions.\n\n   Then H = 10.\n\n   and the actions for turns 1 to 10.\n\n   But is there a way with 9 actions? \n\n        then we would be at row9 at turn10.\n\n        to go from row1 to row9 in 9 actions, we need 8 net up and possibly some down/ stay, but down or stay would require extra up to compensate, so we must have exactly 8 up and 1 down or stay? but then we would be at row1+8-1=8 or 1+8+0=9? \n\n        with 8 up and 1 down: \n            1 + 8 - 1 = 8, not 9.\n        with 9 actions: 8 up and 1 stay: 1+8+0=9.\n        or 9 ups: 1+9=10 -> not allowed.\n\n        so we need 8 ups and 1 in any action.\n\n        but the down or stay must be in the first actions, and we must avoid unsafe states.\n\n        try: \n          turn1: S (stay) -> then at turn2, we are at row1: unsafe (freeway1 at turn2 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n          turn1: U -> turn2: row2: unsafe (freeway2 at turn2) -> not allowed.\n          turn1: D -> turn2: row0: safe.\n          then we have 8 actions left to get to row9, which requires 9 net up from row0: 9 ups. \n          so we need 9 ups in the remaining 8 actions -> impossible.\n\n        Therefore, 9 actions are not enough.\n\n        Hence, minimal actions is 10.\n\n   So the answer is 10 actions: D, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\n   Let me verify safety:\n\n        turn1: at (1,1) -> safe.\n                action D: \n        turn2: at (2,0) -> safe.\n                action U:\n        turn3: at (3,1) -> freeway1 at turn3: safe.\n                action U:\n        turn4: at (4,2) -> freeway2 at turn4: safe.\n                action U:\n        turn5: at (5,3) -> freeway3 at turn5: safe.\n                action U:\n        turn6: at (6,4) -> freeway4 at turn6: safe.\n                action U:\n        turn7: at (7,5) -> freeway5: always safe.\n                action U:\n        turn8: at (8,6) -> freeway6: always safe.\n                action U:\n        turn9: at (9,7) -> freeway7: always safe.\n                action U:\n        turn10: at (10,8) -> freeway8: at turn10: safe (>=3).\n                action U:\n        turn11: at (11,9) -> goal.\n\n   and we output the actions for turn1 to turn10.\n\n   So the answer is:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn 1: D\n   Turn 2: U\n   Turn 3: U\n   Turn 4: U\n   Turn 5: U\n   Turn 6: U\n   Turn 7: U\n   Turn 8: U\n   Turn 9: U\n   Turn 10: U\n   }\n\n   But wait, the action at turn10 should bring us to row9 at turn11, and the problem might not need that, but in this case, we have to output 10 actions.\n\n   And the minimal number of turns H is 10.\n\n   But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we output H actions.\n\n   So this should be it.\n\n   However, in the summary, freeway8 is safe for turn10 (>=3) -> yes.\n\n   So it is safe.\n\n   Therefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 1, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\). Moving down (D) to \\((0, 0)\\) avoids the unsafe freeway 1 at turn 2.\n- At turn 2, moving up (U) to \\((0, 1)\\) is safe since freeway 1 is safe at turn 3.\n- At turn 3, moving up (U) to \\((0, 2)\\) is safe since freeway 2 is safe at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, moving up (U) to \\((0, 3)\\) is safe.\n- From turns 5 to 10, moving up (U) each time progresses safely through freeways 3 to 8, as they are safe at the respective turns.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 1:  D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=2 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right at constant speeds. For collision, it happens at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t1=2. I need to find actions from turn 2 onwards.\n\nFirst, list all cars and their positions at turn 2:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, head -24, tail 11, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11], but head and tail: for left-moving, head is the front, which is smaller x if moving left? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: h = -24, τ = 11, s=36, left.\n\nBut head and tail: for left-moving, I think head is the left end when moving left? The problem says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so at T, it's [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ, with h < τ? Here h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, so the car is from -24 to 11, and since it's moving left, the head is at the left, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], which is [tail, head], so for right-moving, τ < h, and it moves right.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3, it has (-24,-35, right,12), but for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ should be less than h.\n\nHere it says (-24,-35, right,12), so τ = -24, h = -35? But -24 > -35, so τ > h, which is inconsistent.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i: suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nIn the notation, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nSo for freeway 1: (head=-24, tail=11, left, speed=36)\n\nSince left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: first (-24,-35, right,12), so head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-35, -24]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation, it's (head, tail, ...), but for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so with head and tail given, we need to interpret.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for a car, head and tail are given, and direction.\n\nThen for left-moving, span = [h, τ] if h < τ, or [τ, h] if τ < h? The problem doesn't specify order, but from the update, it should be min to max.\n\nLet's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for right: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo for the span to make sense, for left-moving, h and τ should be such that the span is from left to right or something, but in terms of position, the smaller number to larger number for the interval.\n\nFor freeway 1: head=-24, tail=11, left-moving. Since left-moving, and span [h,τ] = [-24,11], so at t1, the car occupies from x= -24 to x=11? But -24 to 11, that's 35 units, which is fine.\n\nWhen it moves left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like in freeway 3: first car (head=-24, tail=-35, right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-35, -24]? τ is tail, h is head, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24], which is from -35 to -24.\n\nAnd it moves right, so span increases.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 3: (12,1,right,12), so head=12, tail=1, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, span [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4 same as 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12), head=-48, tail=-59, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAnd (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24]\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4), head=56, tail=45, right-moving, span [45,56]\n\nAnd (8,-3,right,4), head=8, tail=-3, span [-3,8]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nPlayer position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nSo for each freeway y from 1 to 8, and for each turn, we need to check if at that turn, for freeway y, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nIf the player is on y at turn T, and for that y, 0 is in a car span at T, then collision.\n\nAlso, when the player moves, at turn T, they are on y_T, and the action determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, they are on y_T.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at turn 2 to y=9 at some turn H, with minimal H.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision possible on y=0 or y=9. Player starts at (0,0), which is safe, and ends at (0,9), safe.\n\nBut during the path, when on y=1 to 8, need to avoid times when a car covers x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, for each car, I can find the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nLet t1 = 2, so ΔT = T - t1 = T - 2.\n\nFor a given car on a freeway, at time T, span is as above.\n\nFor left-moving car: span(T) = [h - s(T-2), τ - s(T-2)]\n\n0 is in span if h - s(T-2) ≤ 0 ≤ τ - s(T-2) or something.\n\nSince it's an interval [low, high], 0 in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36\n\nSpan(T) = [ -24 - 36(T-2) , 11 - 36(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36(T-2) ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36(T-2)\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2 same as freeway 1, since same car description.\n\nFreeway 2 also (-24,11,left,36), same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3 has three cars, etc.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3, freeway 5,6,7 similar, freeway 8 different.\n\nAlso, for each freeway, multiple cars, so 0 is covered if any car covers it.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times T when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: span(T) = [ -24 -36(T-2) , 11 -36(T-2) ]\n\nSet low(T) = -24 -36(T-2)\n\nhigh(T) = 11 -36(T-2)\n\n0 in [low, high] if low(T) ≤ 0 ≤ high(T)\n\nSo:\n\n-24 -36(T-2) ≤ 0  and  0 ≤ 11 -36(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36(T-2) ≤ 0 => -36(T-2) ≤ 24 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-2) ≥ -24? Let's careful.\n\n-24 -36(T-2) ≤ 0\n\nAdd 24 to both sides: -36(T-2) ≤ 24\n\nDivide both sides by -36, reverse inequality: (T-2) ≥ -24/36 = -2/3\n\n-24/36 = -24÷12 / 36÷12 = -2/3, yes.\n\nSo T-2 ≥ -2/3, since T integer, T-2 ≥ 0? -2/3, so T-2 ≥ ceil(-2/3) = 0? T-2 ≥ -2/3, since T integer, T-2 ≥ 0 because -2/3 < 0, but inequality is ≥, so T-2 ≥ -2/3, which is true for all T since -2/3 <0 and T-2 integer, so always true? No.\n\nT-2 ≥ -2/3, and T-2 integer, so for T-2 = 0,1,2,... all satisfy since 0 > -2/3, etc. But T-2 = -1: -1 >= -2/3? -1 = -6/6 < -4/6 = -2/3? -1 = -3/3 = -6/6, -2/3 = -4/6, -6/6 < -4/6, so -1 < -2/3, so T-2 = -1 does not satisfy. Similarly, T-2 = 0: 0 > -2/3, true.\n\nSo inequality: -24 -36(T-2) <= 0\n\n-36(T-2) <= 24\n\nDivide by -36, reverse: T-2 >= -24/36 = -2/3\n\nSince T integer, T-2 >= ceil(-2/3) = 0? ceil(-2/3) is the smallest integer greater than or equal, which is 0? -2/3 ≈ -0.666, ceil is 0? No, ceil is for upper bound, but here inequality.\n\nT-2 >= -2/3, and T-2 integer, so T-2 >= 0 because if T-2 = -1, -1 < -2/3? -1 = -0.666? -1 = -1.000 < -0.666, yes, so -1 < -2/3, so T-2 >= 0.\n\n-2/3 ≈ -0.666, so T-2 must be at least 0, since -1 is less.\n\nSo T-2 >= 0, so T >= 2.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36(T-2)\n\nSo 0 <= 11 -36(T-2)\n\nThus 36(T-2) <= 11\n\nT-2 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nT-2 <= 0.305, since T integer, T-2 <= 0\n\nSo T-2 <= 0 and T-2 >= 0, so T-2 = 0, T=2.\n\nFrom first inequality T-2 >=0, from second T-2 <=0, so T-2=0, T=2.\n\nFor freeway 1, 0 in span only at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, low(2) = -24 -36(0) = -24, high(2) =11 -0=11, so -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nAt T=3, low(3) = -24 -36(1) = -60, high(3)=11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other times not.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only at T=2, 0 is covered.\n\nBut at T=2, player is at (0,0), which is not on freeway 1, since freeway 1 is y=1, player at y=0, so no collision. Player on y=0 at turn 2.\n\nFreeway 1 is for y=1, so when player is on y=1, need to check.\n\nBut at T=2, player on y=0, not on freeway, so for freeway 1, no issue except when on y=1 at some T.\n\nBut 0 is covered only at T=2, so for other times, if player on y=1, it might be safe, but let's see.\n\nFor freeway 1, since 0 covered only at T=2, and player not on y=1 at T=2, so for freeway 1, 0 is never covered when player could be there, except at T=2 but player not there. So freeway 1 is always safe? No, 0 covered only at T=2, so for T>2, span doesn't cover 0, so if player on y=1 at any T>2, it should be safe, since no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same as freeway 1, only covered at T=2.\n\nFreeway 2 has same car, so same thing.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35, right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T, span(T) = [ -35 + 12(T-2) , -24 + 12(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12(T-2) <= 0 <= -24 +12(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12(T-2) <= 0 => 12(T-2) <= 35 => T-2 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so T-2 <= 2 since integer, T-2 <= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +12(T-2) => 24 <= 12(T-2) => 2 <= T-2 => T-2 >= 2\n\nSo T-2 >=2 and T-2 <=2, so T-2=2, T=4\n\nAt T=4, span: low = -35 +12(2) = -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 included, yes.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, right-moving, span(t1) = [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 +12(T-2), 12+12(T-2)] = [1+12ΔT, 12+12ΔT] where ΔT=T-2\n\n0 in span: 1+12ΔT <= 0 <= 12+12ΔT\n\nFirst: 1+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -1 => ΔT <= -1/12, so ΔT <= -1 since integer, ΔT <= -1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12+12ΔT => 12ΔT >= -12 => ΔT >= -1\n\nSo ΔT <= -1 and ΔT >= -1, so ΔT = -1, T-2 = -1, T=1\n\nBut T=1 is before t1=2, so not relevant for future turns.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, span(t1)= [37,48]\n\nAt T, [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\n0 in: 37+12ΔT <=0 <=48+12ΔT\n\nFirst: 37+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -37 => ΔT <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, ΔT <= -4\n\nSecond: 0<=48+12ΔT => 12ΔT >= -48 => ΔT >= -4\n\nSo ΔT <= -4 and ΔT >= -4, ΔT= -4, T-2= -4, T= -2, way before.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only at T=4, the first car covers x=0, from the first car.\n\nAt T=4, span [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nFor other times, no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as freeway 3, since same cars.\n\nFreeway 4 has same cars: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), so same as freeway 3, so only at T=4, x=0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars: (-48,-59,right,12), head=-48, tail=-59, right-moving, span(t1)= [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T, [ -59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 in: -59+12ΔT <=0 <= -48+12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈4.916, ΔT <=4\n\nSecond: 0<= -48+12ΔT => 48<=12ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT <=4 and ΔT >=4, ΔT=4, T-2=4, T=6\n\nAt T=6, span: low= -59+12*4= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, span(t1)= [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13+12ΔT, 24+12ΔT]\n\n0 in: 13+12ΔT <=0 <=24+12ΔT\n\nFirst: 13+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -13 => ΔT <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083, ΔT <= -2\n\nSecond: 0<=24+12ΔT => 12ΔT >= -24 => ΔT >= -2\n\nSo ΔT <= -2 and ΔT >= -2, ΔT= -2, T=0\n\nBefore t1.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only at T=6, covered by first car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 and 7 same as freeway 5, so only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 have same cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12), so same, only T=6 covered.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst: (56,45,right,4), head=56, tail=45, right-moving, span(t1)= [τ,h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T, [45 +4ΔT, 56+4ΔT]\n\n0 in: 45+4ΔT <=0 <=56+4ΔT\n\nFirst: 45+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <= -45 => ΔT <= -45/4 = -11.25, ΔT <= -12\n\nSecond: 0<=56+4ΔT => 4ΔT >= -56 => ΔT >= -14\n\nBut ΔT <= -12 and ΔT >= -14, so possible ΔT= -12,-13,-14\n\nBut ΔT <= -12 and ΔT >= -14, so for ΔT= -12: 45+4*(-12)=45-48= -3 <=0, 56-48=8>0, so 0 in [-3,8]\n\nSimilarly, ΔT= -13: 45-52= -7 <=0, 56-52=4>0, 0 in\n\nΔT= -14: 45-56= -11 <=0, 56-56=0, 0 in\n\nBut these are for T<2, since ΔT negative.\n\nT-2 = ΔT, so for T=2-12= -10, etc, before t1, not relevant.\n\nSecond car on freeway 8: (8,-3,right,4), head=8, tail=-3, right-moving, span(t1)= [τ,h] = [-3,8]\n\nAt T, [ -3 +4ΔT, 8+4ΔT ]\n\n0 in: -3+4ΔT <=0 <=8+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -3+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=3 => ΔT <= 3/4=0.75, so ΔT <=0 since integer\n\nSecond: 0<=8+4ΔT => 4ΔT >= -8 => ΔT >= -2\n\nSo ΔT <=0 and ΔT >= -2, so ΔT = -2, -1, 0\n\nThus T-2 = -2, -1, 0 => T=0,1,2\n\nAt T=0,1,2, covered.\n\nBut T=2 is current turn, t1=2.\n\nAt T=2, for freeway 8, this car covers x=0, span [-3 +4*0, 8+0] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nBut player at T=2 is on y=0, not on freeway 8, so no collision.\n\nFor future, T>2, for freeway 8, this car does not cover x=0 after T=2.\n\nAre there other cars? Only this one on freeway 8 that can cover, but only at T=0,1,2, so for T>2, no car on freeway 8 covers x=0.\n\nFirst car never covers for T>2.\n\nSo for freeway 8, x=0 covered only at T=0,1,2, so for T>2, safe.\n\nSummary for each freeway, times when x=0 is covered:\n\n- Freeway 1: only T=2\n\n- Freeway 2: only T=2\n\n- Freeway 3: only T=4\n\n- Freeway 4: only T=4\n\n- Freeway 5: only T=6\n\n- Freeway 6: only T=6\n\n- Freeway 7: only T=6\n\n- Freeway 8: only T=0,1,2 (not future)\n\nSo for freeways, the dangerous times are:\n\n- On y=1: only at T=2, but player not there at T=2, so y=1 is always safe to be on.\n\nSimilarly y=2 always safe.\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=4\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=4\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=6\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=6\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=6\n\ny=8: always safe for T>2\n\nPlayer starts at turn 2, y=0.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nMinimal turns: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 steps if we go up every time, but might need to wait due to cars.\n\nBut the cars only block at specific times, so we need to avoid being on certain y at certain T.\n\nSpecifically, we cannot be on y=3 or y=4 at T=4, because at T=4, x=0 covered on y=3 and y=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nOther times and other positions are safe.\n\ny=1,2,8 always safe.\n\ny=3 and y=4 only dangerous at T=4, so if we are on y=3 or 4 at other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6,7, only dangerous at T=6.\n\nNow, player moves at each turn: action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=8 is always safe, and y=9 safe, we can go directly if no issues, but we have to go through y=3 to 7 which have dangers.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=4 and T=6.\n\nTurn T=4 is 2 steps from now: from turn 2, turn 3, then turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, T=6 is 4 steps from now: turn 3,4,5,6.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at turn 4.\n\nAnd avoid being on y=5,6,7 at turn 6.\n\nNow, at turn 4, if we are on y=3 or 4, collision.\n\nSimilarly turn 6, on y=5,6,7 collision.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nWe start at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAction at turn 2: we can go up to y=1, or stay at y=0, or down, but y=0 is bottom, so down not possible? y in [0,9], so from y=0, D would make y=-1 not allowed, so from y=0, only U or S possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, only D or S.\n\nBut here start y=0.\n\nSo at turn 2, actions: U or S.\n\nIf U, to y=1 at turn 3.\n\nIf S, stay y=0 at turn 3.\n\nNow, turn 4 is critical for y=3 and 4.\n\nWe need to not be on y=3 or 4 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, turn 6 for y=5,6,7.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we might need to delay or something to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nSince y=3 and 4 are only dangerous at T=4, we can be there at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence to y=9 with min turns.\n\nFirst, suppose we go up every turn from start.\n\nStart turn 2, y=0.\n\nAction U: turn 3, y=1\n\nAction U: turn 4, y=2\n\nNow at turn 4, y=2, which is safe, since y=2 not dangerous at T=4.\n\nThen action U: turn 5, y=3\n\nNow turn 5, y=3. Is it safe? y=3 dangerous only at T=4, not at T=5, so safe.\n\nAction U: turn 6, y=4\n\nBut turn 6, y=4. Now y=4 dangerous at T=4, but T=6 is different. y=4 dangerous only at T=4, not at T=6, so at T=6, y=4 is safe.\n\nBut at turn 6, we are on y=4, which is not dangerous at T=6; dangerous at T=6 are y=5,6,7.\n\ny=4 is fine at T=6.\n\nThen action U: turn 7, y=5\n\nNow turn 7, y=5. Dangerous at T=6? T=6 is past, now T=7, not dangerous. Only T=6 dangerous for y=5,6,7.\n\nSo at T=7, y=5 safe.\n\nAction U: turn 8, y=6\n\nSimilarly, safe.\n\nAction U: turn 9, y=7\n\nSafe.\n\nAction U: turn 10, y=8\n\nAction U: turn 11, y=9. Done.\n\nH=10 turns? From turn 2 to turn 11, that's 10 actions? Let's see.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, y_t.\n\nStart turn 2, y_2=0.\n\nAfter action at turn 2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} should be 9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 or what? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nTurn 2: action, say U, then turn 3: y=1\n\nTurn 3: action U, turn 4: y=2\n\nTurn 4: action U, turn 5: y=3\n\nTurn 5: action U, turn 6: y=4\n\nTurn 6: action U, turn 7: y=5\n\nTurn 7: action U, turn 8: y=6\n\nTurn 8: action U, turn 9: y=7\n\nTurn 9: action U, turn 10: y=8\n\nTurn 10: action U, turn 11: y=9\n\nSo after 9 actions (turns 2 to 10), y at turn 11 is 9. So H=9? Turns: actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, that's 9 actions, position at t=11 is y=9.\n\nt1 + H = 2 + H, we have y_{2+H} =9, so 2+H=11, H=9.\n\nBut is this safe? In this path, we were never on y=3 or 4 at turn 4? At turn 4, we were on y=2, which is fine.\n\nAt turn 6, we were on y=4, but y=4 is not dangerous at turn 6; dangerous at turn 6 are y=5,6,7.\n\nWe were on y=4 at turn 6, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 7, y=5, but turn 7 is not turn 6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn 11, with 9 actions.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nMinimal H: since from y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so H at least 9, so this is minimal.\n\nBut we used only U, no S or D, and it seems safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous points.\n\nAt turn 4: we are on y=2, freeway 2? y=2 is freeway, but at turn 4, for y=2, is x=0 covered? From earlier, for y=2, which is freeway 2, we had only covered at T=2, not at T=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 6, we are on y=4. Freeway 4, covered only at T=4, not T=6, so at T=6, no car covers x=0 on y=4, so safe.\n\nThen on to y=5 at turn 7, which is after T=6, so safe.\n\ny=5 at turn 7, freeway 5 covered only at T=6, not T=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to output actions from turn t1=2.\n\nSo actions: turn 2: U, turn 3: U, turn 4: U, turn 5: U, turn 6: U, turn 7: U, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut turn 10 action U, to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow, H=9 turns of actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? That would require reaching y=9 by turn 10, so from y=0 at turn 2 to y=9 at turn 10, which is 8 steps, but each step max +1, so min 9 steps needed, since 0 to 9 is 9 increments. So impossible in less than 9 actions. Thus H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in the path, we used 9 actions, reached at turn 11.\n\nPerhaps we can start by staying or something, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for some turns, then go up, it would take more actions to reach y=9.\n\nSo the direct up path seems optimal and safe.\n\nBut let's double-check if at any point we are on a dangerous spot.\n\nTurn 4: y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: at T=4, is x=0 covered?\n\nFrom earlier, for freeway 2, only covered at T=2, not at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, turn 6: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 covered only at T=4, not T=6.\n\nTurn 7: y=5, freeway 5 covered at T=6? At T=7, not covered, since only T=6.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 5, at T=6 covered, but we are on y=5 at turn 7, not turn 6.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 2, we are at y=0, and we go U to y=1 at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: covered only at T=2, not T=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be actions from turn t1.\n\nSo for turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: U\n\nBut turn 10 is t1 + H -1? t1=2, H=9, actions from t=2 to t=2+8=10? t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH actions: at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter that, at turn t1+H, position is 9.\n\nSo here t1=2, H=9, actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThen y_{11} =9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, all actions U.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nBut is there any issue with freeway 8 or something?\n\nAt some point we go through y=8.\n\ny=8 at turn 10? In the sequence, at turn 10 action U, from y=8 to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, we are on y=8 when we do action? Let's see positions.\n\nTurn 2: start y=0\n\nAfter action U at turn 2: turn 3, y=1\n\nAction U at turn 3: turn 4, y=2\n\nAction U at turn 4: turn 5, y=3\n\nAction U at turn 5: turn 6, y=4\n\nAction U at turn 6: turn 7, y=5\n\nAction U at turn 7: turn 8, y=6\n\nAction U at turn 8: turn 9, y=7\n\nAction U at turn 9: turn 10, y=8\n\nAction U at turn 10: turn 11, y=9\n\nAt turn 10, we are on y=8 when we perform action U to go to y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 10, we are on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nIs x=0 covered on freeway 8 at turn 10?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 8 only covered at T=0,1,2, not at T=10, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by going down or something, but no, since we start at 0, need to go up.\n\nUnless we go down to 0 and stay, but that wastes time.\n\nSo I think H=9 with all U actions is correct.\n\nBut in the initial thought, I thought y=3 and y=4 dangerous at T=4, but in this path, we are not on them at T=4; at T=4 we are on y=2.\n\nSimilarly for T=6, we are on y=4, not dangerous.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we go up slower.\n\nFor example, if at turn 2, we stay, y=0 at turn 3, then U to y=1 at turn 4, etc., but that would take more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor instance, if we stay at turn 2: S, then turn 3 y=0, then U turn 4 y=1, U turn 5 y=2, U turn 6 y=3, but at turn 6, if we go to y=3, but turn 6 is dangerous for y=5,6,7, not for y=3.\n\ny=3 dangerous only at T=4.\n\nAt T=6, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 turn 7, etc., but we reach later.\n\nFor example, turn 2 S: turn 3 y=0\n\nTurn 3 U: turn 4 y=1\n\nTurn 4 U: turn 5 y=2\n\nTurn 5 U: turn 6 y=3\n\nTurn 6 U: turn 7 y=4\n\nTurn 7 U: turn 8 y=5\n\nTurn 8 U: turn 9 y=6\n\nTurn 9 U: turn 10 y=7\n\nTurn 10 U: turn 11 y=8\n\nTurn 11 U: turn 12 y=9\n\nSo H=10 actions, worse.\n\nIf we go up directly, we save one turn.\n\nAnother path: suppose we want to avoid being on y=4 at turn 4, but in the direct path, we are not on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, we are on y=2.\n\nIf we go faster, we can't.\n\nPerhaps use down, but from y=0, can't go down.\n\nSo I think all U is best.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=2.\n\nWe need to output actions from turn 2 to turn 10, all U.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be like:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 10: U\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=2 to t=10 inclusive, that's 9 actions.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nBut just to make sure, is there a collision at any point?\n\nFor example, at turn 5, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 5, T=5, freeway 3 covered only at T=4, not T=5, so no car covers x=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 6, y=4, freeway 4, covered at T=4, not T=6, safe.\n\nTurn 7, y=5, freeway 5, covered at T=6, not T=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps on freeway 8, but no.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 3, at T=4 covered, but we are not on y=3 at T=4.\n\nIn the path, at T=4, we are on y=2.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut let's write the actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9)\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to turn 10.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt says: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nSo here t_1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, it ends at turn 10, which is t1 + H -1 = 2 + 9 -1 = 10, yes.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 2 + 9 -1 =10, action at turn 10.\n\nThen position at turn 11.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 2 to turn 10, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 11.\n\n### Verification of Safety:\n- The dangerous turns for specific freeways are:\n  - Freeways 3 and 4: Dangerous at turn 4 (x=0 covered).\n  - Freeways 5, 6, and 7: Dangerous at turn 6 (x=0 covered).\n  - Other freeways (1, 2, 8) are safe at all turns after \\(t_1 = 2\\), as x=0 is not covered at any future turn.\n- Player path and collision check:\n  - Turn 3: y=1 (freeway 1) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 3.\n  - Turn 4: y=2 (freeway 2) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 4.\n  - Turn 5: y=3 (freeway 3) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 5 (only dangerous at turn 4).\n  - Turn 6: y=4 (freeway 4) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 6 (only dangerous at turn 4).\n  - Turn 7: y=5 (freeway 5) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 7 (only dangerous at turn 6).\n  - Turn 8: y=6 (freeway 6) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 8 (only dangerous at turn 6).\n  - Turn 9: y=7 (freeway 7) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 9 (only dangerous at turn 6).\n  - Turn 10: y=8 (freeway 8) – safe, as x=0 not covered at turn 10.\n  - Turn 11: y=9 – goal reached, safe (no freeway at y=9).\n\n### Optimality:\n- The player starts at y=0 and needs to reach y=9, requiring a minimum of 9 upward moves (each increasing y by 1). Since no fewer than 9 actions can achieve this, \\(H=9\\) is minimal.\n- The all-up path achieves this minimum without delays, and no collisions occur as the dangerous turns (4 and 6) are avoided for the relevant freeways.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2\\) to \\(10\\) is all U (Up).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) at turn t_1 = 3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're still on y at turn T, and you move to y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nNow, the cars are given for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to y=8, each can have multiple cars. Each car has head, tail, direction, speed. Direction left means it moves left, so position decreases over time. Direction right means it moves right, position increases.\n\nThe span at turn T is given by the formulas:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)] but since it's moving left, head and tail decrease. In the notation, for left, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. But typically, head and tail might be such that for left-moving, h > τ or something? I need to be careful with the order.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36). Since direction left, and h = -60, τ = -25. But -60 is less than -25, so [h, τ] = [-60, -25] which is from left to right? But since it's moving left, positions decrease, so at T, it becomes [ -60 - sΔT, -25 - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: (-12, -23, right, 12), but (-12, -23), if right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h? Here it's given as (head, tail), but for right, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so in the input, for right, it might be listed with tail first or head first? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ should be the left end, h the right end, I assume.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 3: (-12, -23, right, 12). -12 and -23, -23 is less than -12, so if τ is tail and h is head, for right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so τ = -23, h = -12? But it's written as (head, tail) in the input? The input says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 3: (-12, -23, right, 12). Here h = -12, τ = -23. Since right-moving, and τ = -23, h = -12, so τ < h, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But the update says for right: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so at t_1, the car occupies [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36), h = -60, τ = -25, since left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? But -60 to -25, with -60 left of -25, so it goes from left to right, but moving left means decreasing positions.\n\nI think it's consistent: for left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ] with h < τ, I assume? In freeway 1, h=-60, τ=-25, so h < τ, and [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. When moving left, both decrease, so positions get smaller.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on at T.\n\nPlayer at turn T is on row y_T, and we check if for that row, any car has 0 in its span at exactly turn T.\n\nAlso, since the player moves at the end of the turn, when you take action a_t at turn t, it affects y_{t+1}. So at turn t, you are on y_t, and after action, you go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn t_1, so action a_{t_1} determines y_{t_1 + 1} from y_{t_1}.\n\nGiven y_{t_1} = 1.\n\nWe need to reach y = 9.\n\nt_1 = 3.\n\nCars:\n\nList all cars for each freeway at t_1=3.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: head=-60, tail=-25, dir=left, speed=36. So span at t: [ -60 - 36*(t-3), -25 - 36*(t-3) ] for t >=3.\n\nSince left-moving.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: same as y=1: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nFreeway y=3: three cars: \n\nFirst: head=-12, tail=-23, dir=right, speed=12. Since right, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? According to update, for right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so with τ and h given? Input is (head, tail), so for right, since Span(t_1)=[τ,h], and it says tail τ, head h, so for right, τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nIn this case, for first car: h=-12, τ=-23, so τ=-23, h=-12, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But -23 to -12, which is from -23 to -12.\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-23 + 12(T-3), -12 + 12(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,12), h=24, τ=13? τ=13, h=24, so Span(t_1) = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12(T-3), 24 + 12(T-3)]\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), h=60, τ=49, Span(t_1)=[49,60], at T: [49+12(T-3),60+12(T-3)]\n\nFreeway y=4: same as y=3: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12) — but (24,13), τ=13,h=24? 13 to 24.\n\nFreeway y=5: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, so for right, τ=-47, h=-36, Span(t_1)=[ -47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 +12(T-3), -36 +12(T-3)]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), τ=25,h=36, Span(t_1)=[25,36], at T: [25+12(T-3),36+12(T-3)]\n\nFreeway y=6: same as y=5: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway y=7: same: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway y=8: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst: (60,49,right,4), τ=49,h=60, Span(t_1)=[49,60], at T: [49+4(T-3),60+4(T-3)]\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4), h=12, τ=1, so τ=1,h=12, Span(t_1)=[1,12], at T: [1+4(T-3),12+4(T-3)]\n\nNow, player starts at (0,1) at turn t=3, so y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be achieved by going up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, we need to move up 8 steps, but we can stay or move down, but moving down would be counterproductive, so probably only up or stay, but staying might be needed to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 in 8 turns: from y1 to y2, y3, ..., y9 in 8 actions? Let's see: at turn t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter action a3, y4 = y3 + Δy, but y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to go from y=1 to y=9, we need to increase y by 8, so at least 8 up actions, but we can have stay actions which don't change y, so H must be at least 8, but could be more if we stay or go down, but since we need to reach 9, going down would require more up actions, so minimal H should be 8 if possible with only up actions, but we have to avoid collisions at each row when we are on it.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 3.\n\nWe need to check for each row and each turn if we are on that row, whether 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince we move one row per up action, we will be on each row for at least one turn, but we might stay multiple turns or skip rows if we go up fast, but since we move one row at a time, we will be on each row from 1 to 9 except possibly we start at 1 and end at 9, so we need to be on rows 1 through 9 at some point.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nWe start at t=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe sequence of y_t must go from 1 to 9, changing by at most 1 each step.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=3 to t=3+H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t=3+H, position y_{3+H}.\n\nSet t_1 = 3.\n\nWe take actions a_{3}, a_{4}, ..., a_{3+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn 3+H, we have y_{3+H} = 9.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn 3, y_3 = 1.\n\nAfter a_3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{3+H-1}, y_{3+H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at y=1 and end at y=9, the net change is +8, so number of up actions minus number of down actions must be 8. Each stay adds 0.\n\nTo minimize H, we should minimize the number of non-up actions, so ideally all up actions, H=8.\n\nBut we may need to stay or even go down to avoid collisions, but going down would increase H, so for minimal H, we probably don't go down, only up or stay.\n\nIf we have stay, H increases, so minimal H=8 with all up actions if possible.\n\nOtherwise, if not possible, we need to add stays, so H>8.\n\nFirst, let's check if we can go directly up from y=1 to y=9 in 8 actions without colliding.\n\nThat means at each turn t, when we are on y_t, for that y_t, at turn t, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince we go up each turn, we are on each row for exactly one turn: at turn 3, y=1; turn 4, y=2; turn 5, y=3; ... up to turn 11, y=9.\n\ny at turn t: start t=3, y=1\n\na3: U, so y4=2\n\na4: U, y5=3\n\n...\n\na10: U, y11=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn 11, which is after 8 actions: actions from t=3 to t=10, H=8.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn t from 3 to 10, at row y=t-2? Let's list:\n\nTurn t, y_t:\n\nt=3, y=1\n\nt=4, y=2\n\nt=5, y=3\n\nt=6, y=4\n\nt=7, y=5\n\nt=8, y=6\n\nt=9, y=7\n\nt=10, y=8\n\nAt turn t=10, y=8, then after U, y11=9, but at turn 11, we are on y=9, but we need to check collision at each turn when we are on the row.\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, but row 9 has no cars, since cars only on freeways 1-8, y=9 is the target, no cars, so no collision possible at y=9.\n\nSo we only care about turns when y_t between 1 and 8.\n\nIn the sequence above, from t=3 to t=10, y_t from 1 to 8.\n\nWe need for each t and y_t, no collision.\n\nNow, collision if for freeway k=y_t, at turn t, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nSo let's check for each turn and row.\n\nFirst, turn t=3, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: left-moving, span at time T: [h - s(T-3), τ - s(T-3)] with h=-60, τ=-25, s=36.\n\nAt T=3, span = [-60 -36(0), -25 -36(0)] = [-60, -25], 0 not in [-60,-25], since -60 to -25, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nFor T=3, ΔT=0, span = [-60, -25], 0 not in.\n\nNow for other T, but we only care at turn t=3.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: same as y=1, car (-60,-25,left,36), so at T=4, ΔT=1, span = [-60 -36(1), -25 -36(1)] = [-96, -61], 0 not in.\n\nt=5, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, h=-12, τ=-23? Earlier: for right, at T, span [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] with τ=-23, h=-12? From input: (head=-12, tail=-23, right,12)\n\nSince right, τ should be tail, left end, h head, right end.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] = [-23 +12(T-3), -12 +12(T-3)]\n\nAt T=5, ΔT=2, span = [-23 +12(2), -12 +12(2)] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12]\n\n0 in [1,12]? 0 is not in [1,12], since 1 to 12, all positive except 1>0.\n\n1 to 12, min 1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nBut 0 is less than 1, so not in the interval.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (24,13,right,12), h=24, τ=13? τ=13, h=24, span at T: [13 +12(T-3), 24 +12(T-3)]\n\nAt T=5, [13+24, 24+24]? ΔT=2, [13+12*2, 24+12*2] = [13+24,24+24]= [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), τ=49,h=60, at T: [49+12(T-3),60+12(T-3)]\n\nAt T=5, [49+24,60+24]= [73,84], no.\n\nSo at t=5, y=3, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow t=6, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 same as y=3: three cars similar.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12), so τ=-23,h=-12, at T=6, ΔT=3, span=[-23+12*3, -12+12*3]= [-23+36, -12+36]= [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), τ=13,h=24, at T=6, [13+36,24+36]= [49,60]? ΔT=3, [13+12*3,24+12*3]= [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], no.\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), [49+36,60+36]=[85,96], no.\n\nSo ok.\n\nt=7, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-36,-47,right,12), h=-36, τ=-47? For right, τ=-47, h=-36, span at T: [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] = [-47 +12(T-3), -36 +12(T-3)]\n\nAt T=7, ΔT=4, span=[-47+48, -36+48]= [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), τ=25,h=36, at T: [25+12(T-3),36+12(T-3)]\n\nAt T=7, [25+48,36+48]= [73,84], no.\n\nt=8, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nSame as y=5: cars like (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nAt T=8, ΔT=5.\n\nFirst car: [-47 +12*5, -36 +12*5] = [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [25+60,36+60]= [85,96], no.\n\nt=9, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nSame as above: cars (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=6.\n\nFirst car: [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [25+72,36+72]= [97,108], no.\n\nt=10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4), τ=49,h=60, span at T: [49 +4(T-3), 60 +4(T-3)]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), τ=1,h=12, span at T: [1 +4(T-3), 12 +4(T-3)]\n\nAt T=10, ΔT=7.\n\nFirst car: [49 +4*7, 60 +4*7] = [49+28,60+28]= [77,88], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [1 +4*7, 12 +4*7] = [1+28,12+28]= [29,40], no 0.\n\nSo at all turns from t=3 to t=10, for the respective rows, no car has 0 in span, so we can go directly up without any issues.\n\nBut at t=10, y=8, and we go to y=9 at t=11, no problem.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=3, y=1; t=4,y=2; ... t=10,y=8; then after U at t=10, y11=9.\n\nBut at turn t=10, we are on y=8, which we checked, and at t=11, y=9, no cars.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn 11, after 8 actions starting from t=3.\n\nActions: a3 to a10, all U.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the second car on freeway 8 at t=10.\n\nSecond car: [1 + 4*7, 12+28] = [29,40], yes.\n\nBut earlier at t=5, freeway 3 first car: at T=5, span [1,12], which is 1 to 12, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, freeway 5 first car: [1,12], same.\n\nBut 0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nIs there any time when 0 is exactly in the span?\n\nFor example, let's see if for some row, at some turn, 0 is covered.\n\nBut in the direct path, all seem fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=1 at t=3, and we go up each turn.\n\nBut freeway 8 has a car at [1,12] at t_1=3? At t=3, for freeway 8.\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nAt turn t=3, we are on y=1, but for other rows, we don't care at t=3.\n\nIn the sequence, only when we are on the row.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at earlier times, but not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: on freeway 3, at t=5, we have a car from [1,12], so at position 0, which is the player's x, but 0 is not in [1,12], since 1 to 12 starts at 1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, [1,12] on y=5.\n\nBut 0 is safe.\n\nBut is there a car that covers 0 at some point?\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, the second car at t_1=3: [1,12], so at t=3, if we were on y=8, but we are not.\n\nAt t=10, it moved to [29,40].\n\nSimilarly, on freeway 3, at t=5, [1,12], but we are on y=3 at t=5, not y= something else.\n\nIn the direct up path, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 3 at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFirst car: τ=-23, h=-12, at T=5, ΔT=2, [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], yes.\n\n0 not in [1,12].\n\nBut position 0 is not covered, since min is 1.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we are at (0,9) at turn 11.\n\nBut the actions are from t=3 to t=10, all U.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions.\n\nBut let me see if there is any issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can reach faster, but H=8 is minimum possible.\n\nBut start at y=1, after one up, y=2, etc., after 8 ups, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car state, on freeway 8, there is a car (12,1,right,4) at t_1=3, which is [1,12] at t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, we are on y=1, not y=8.\n\nIf we were on y=8 at t=3, we would collide, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, only when on the row.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, we need to be careful at some turns.\n\nBut in our path, we are on row 8 only at t=10, when the car is at [29,40], no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for row 1 at t=3, car at [-60,-25], no issue.\n\nBut let me check row 2 at t=4.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=4: car [-96,-61], no.\n\nAll seem fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), and cars move horizontally, so only the x=0 position matters for collision.\n\nIn the span, if 0 is in the interval, collision.\n\nIn all cases above, 0 not in the span at the relevant times.\n\nBut on freeway 3 at t=5, span [1,12] for one car, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, freeway 5, [1,12], same.\n\nNow, but let me see if at some other time, 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, the second car: at t_1=3, span [1,12], so at exactly t=3, if on y=8, collision, but not.\n\nWhen does this car cover 0? Span [1 +4(T-3), 12+4(T-3)]\n\nSet 1 +4(ΔT) <= 0 <= 12 +4(ΔT)? But 1 +4ΔT >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 never in the span since min is 1 at ΔT=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nOn freeway 3 first car, span at T: [-23 +12ΔT, -12 +12ΔT]\n\nSet -23 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -12 +12ΔT\n\n0 <= -12 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=1\n\nAnd -23 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so ΔT=1 or 2? ΔT integer since turns.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=4, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the right end.\n\nIs 0 in [ -11, 0 ]? Yes, since it includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=2, T=5, [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=4, span [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is in the span.\n\nBut at T=4, if we are on freeway 3, we would collide.\n\nIn our path, at t=4, we are on y=2, not y=3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5 first car: τ=-47, h=-36, span at T: [-47 +12ΔT, -36 +12ΔT]\n\nSet -47 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -36 +12ΔT\n\n0 <= -36 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=3\n\nAnd -47 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=47 => ΔT <=47/12≈3.916, so ΔT=3 or 4? ΔT=3: T=6, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=4: T=7, [-47+48, -36+48]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=6, if on freeway 5, collide.\n\nBut in our path, at t=6, we are on y=4, not y=5.\n\nt=6, y=4.\n\nFreeway 5 is y=5.\n\nSo not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no problem in direct path.\n\nBut back to the sequence: we can go all up, H=8.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,1) at t=3, and we need to output actions starting from t=3.\n\nSo actions: for turn t_1=3: U\n\nThen turn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so t=3 to 10, all U.\n\nBut let me confirm H: we take H actions, from t=3 to t=3+H-1, and after that, at turn t=3+H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, after 8 actions, at turn 3+8=11, y=9, yes.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 8, there is a car (12,1,right,4), which at t_1=3 is [1,12], and since min is 1, 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut is there a problem on row 8?\n\nFreeway 8 at t=10: second car [1+4*7,12+28]= [29,40], no.\n\nBut what about the first car on freeway 8: (60,49,right,4), at T=10, [49+28,60+28]=[77,88], no.\n\nPerhaps we should check if at t=3, for row 1, but car at [-60,-25], no.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nBut the player starts at y=1, and we go up immediately.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 second car: (12,1,right,4), tail=1, head=12, so at t=3, [1,12], and it moves right.\n\nAt time T, position [1+4(ΔT), 12+4(ΔT)]\n\nFor ΔT=0, [1,12], includes positions 1 to 12.\n\nx=0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, only if the span includes 0.\n\nIn this case, never.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in freeway 3, at T=4, car has [ -11,0 ], so if at T=4 on y=3, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at T=4, we are on y=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for the direct up path, no collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8 with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +7: a_{t_1 +7} = U\n\nSince t_1=3, actions from t=3 to t=10.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, H=8, so t=3 to 10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the format is \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is for actions at those turns.\n\nIn the action, at turn t, we specify a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, take a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence above, all a_t = U, so y increases each time.\n\nNow, but I recall that on freeway 8, there is a car (12,1,right,4), which at t=3 is at [1,12], so if we were to be on row 8 at turn 3 or when it covers 0, but it never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps for row 1, but car is far left.\n\nBut let me see the initial state: player at (0,1) at turn 3.\n\nAfter U at turn 3, to y=2 at turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, on y=2, freeway 2 car at [-96,-61], no collision.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut why is there a car on freeway 8 with (12,1,right,4) at t=3? [1,12], which includes x=1 to 12, but not x=0.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player must avoid being on the row when car is at 0, but in this case, not.\n\nSo I think H=8 is achievable.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it faster, but we can't, since we need to move up 8 times.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=1.\n\nMinimal turns is 8.\n\nPerhaps with stay, but that would increase H.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3, there is a car at t=4 with span [-11,0], so if we are on row 3 at turn 4, we collide.\n\nIn our path, we are on row 3 at turn 5, not turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, we are on row 2.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5, at turn 6, car has [-11,0], but we are on row 5 at turn 7 in the path, when it is [1,12].\n\nt=7, y=5, freeway 5 car at [1,12], not covering 0.\n\nAt turn 6, if we were on row 5, it would be bad, but we are not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 3: U  \nTurn 4: U  \nTurn 5: U  \nTurn 6: U  \nTurn 7: U  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U  \n}\n\nBut in the box, it should be written as per format.\n\nThe turn numbers: since t_1=3, and actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = 3 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 8, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 3 to turn 10. This sequence increases the player's \\(y\\)-coordinate by 1 each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\nAt each turn, the player's position and the relevant car spans are checked for collision (i.e., whether 0 is in any car's span on the player's current freeway). The analysis shows no collisions occur during this sequence:\n- **Turn 3 (\\(y = 1\\))**: Freeway 1 car span at \\(T=3\\) is \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 4 (\\(y = 2\\))**: Freeway 2 car span at \\(T=4\\) is \\([-96, -61]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 5 (\\(y = 3\\))**: Freeway 3 cars:\n  - First car span at \\(T=5\\): \\([-23 + 12(2), -12 + 12(2)] = [1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([13 + 24, 24 + 24] = [37, 48]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Third car: \\([49 + 24, 60 + 24] = [73, 84]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 6 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 cars:\n  - First car span at \\(T=6\\): \\([-23 + 36, -12 + 36] = [13, 24]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([13 + 36, 24 + 36] = [49, 60]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Third car: \\([49 + 36, 60 + 36] = [85, 96]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 7 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 cars:\n  - First car span at \\(T=7\\): \\([-47 + 48, -36 + 48] = [1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([25 + 48, 36 + 48] = [73, 84]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 cars:\n  - First car span at \\(T=8\\): \\([-47 + 60, -36 + 60] = [13, 24]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([25 + 60, 36 + 60] = [85, 96]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 cars:\n  - First car span at \\(T=9\\): \\([-47 + 72, -36 + 72] = [25, 36]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([25 + 72, 36 + 72] = [97, 108]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 cars:\n  - First car span at \\(T=10\\): \\([49 + 28, 60 + 28] = [77, 88]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([1 + 28, 12 + 28] = [29, 40]\\), 0 not in span.\n\nAt turn 11, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), where there are no cars, so no collision is possible.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions is all U for 8 turns, starting from turn 3.\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 3: U \\\\  \nTurn 4: U \\\\  \nTurn 5: U \\\\  \nTurn 6: U \\\\  \nTurn 7: U \\\\  \nTurn 8: U \\\\  \nTurn 9: U \\\\  \nTurn 10: U  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span decreases over time because they're moving left. For right-moving cars, the span increases because they're moving right.\n\nLet me denote the time difference. Since we start at turn t_1 = 4, for any future turn T, the time elapsed is T - 4.\n\nA collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn. The player's y-position changes based on actions: U for up (y increases), D for down (y decreases), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nAlso, importantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that new row until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. If at turn T, you are on y_T, and 0 is in some car's span on row y_T, you collide. But if you move to a different row, you don't check the new row until you're actually on it at the next turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSpan(T) is the span at turn T. So for row y_{T+1}, at turn T, if 0 is in some car's span on row y_{T+1} at turn T, but since you're not on that row until turn T+1, and at turn T+1 the span might be different, so you only care about the span on the row you are currently on at the current turn.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if player is on row y_T, and for any car on that row, 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWhen you are on a row at turn T, you check the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T you are on y_T, and you go to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nSince it's left-moving, head at 48, tail at 83? Head and tail: for left-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail at τ\", and span is [h, τ] for left-moving? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83, s=36, left-moving.\n\nBut head and tail: typically for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the left, I think? Let's see the span.\n\nAt t1=4, span is [48,83]. Since it's left-moving, as T increases, both decrease.\n\nBut [48,83], if it's moving left, the head is at 48, tail at 83, but 48 to 83, that would be from left to right if x increases right, but since it's moving left, the positions are decreasing, so at t1, it's from 48 to 83, which is a positive span, but moving left, so over time, both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3, it has (0, -11, right, 12), so for right-moving, head at h, tail at τ, and span is [τ, h]? It says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\" in the update rule.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car list, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 3: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSo head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12(T-4), 0 + 12(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to freeway 1: left-moving, head 48, tail 83? That seems odd because 48 to 83, if x increases right, 48 is left, 83 is right, but it's left-moving, so head should be the front when moving, which for left-moving, left is front, so head at smaller x.\n\nIn this case, head h=48, tail τ=83, so at t1, span [48,83], moving left, so head at 48, tail at 83, meaning the car is from x=48 to x=83, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 same as 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, head h, tail τ, span [τ, h] at t1.\n\nFirst car: h=0, τ=-11, so span [-11, 0]\n\nSecond car: h=36, τ=25? It says (36, 25, right, 12), but head and tail: if head is 36, tail is 25, but for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [25, 36]? But it says head h=36, tail τ=25, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so tail at 25, head at 36, so span [25,36] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, third car: h=-48, τ=-59, span [-59, -48]\n\nNow freeway 4 same as 3.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35? Head and tail: (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSecond car: h=48, τ=37, span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 5 and 6? It says for 7: (-24,-35,right,12), (48,37,right,12) same as 5.\n\nBut freeway 8 is different: (-48,-59,right,4), (16,5,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, span [-59,-48] right-moving\n\nSecond car: h=16, τ=5, span [5,16] right-moving\n\nAnd speeds are 4 for both.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn t=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, but freeways are from 1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might have no cars, but we start at y=2.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so x=0, y=9.\n\nx is always 0 for player, I think, since we only move vertically? The player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, and we move vertically.\n\nCars are on the freeways, which are horizontal at each y, and we care about whether x=0 is occupied by a car at the time we are on that row.\n\nFor each freeway row, we need to check at each turn if x=0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nNow, since the player moves vertically, and we need to go from y=2 to y=9, so up 7 rows, but we can move up, down, or stay, so we might not go directly up.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied, i.e., if 0 is in some car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nThen, when the player is on a row at turn T, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nAlso, at turn T, player position y_T determines which row to check.\n\nStart at turn t=4, y=2.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions that gets to y=9 in min H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=4 to t=4+H-1, so after H-1 actions, we are at turn t=4+H-1 with y=9.\n\nLet me define the turns: let τ = T - t1 = T - 4, so τ is the offset from current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, turn T=4, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ = H-1, so after H steps, but H turns include from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nLet's say after k actions, we are at turn t=4+k, position y_{4+k}.\n\nWe start at t=4, y=2, before any action.\n\nThen at turn t=4, we choose action a_4, which determines y_5.\n\nThen at turn t=5, we are at y_5, and so on.\n\nWe need to have y_{4+k} = 9 for some k, and k as small as possible.\n\nk is the number of actions, so H = k+1 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, so H actions? No.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H}, and we need y_{t1+H} =9? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nFrom the player update: at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), and we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, then at turn t+1, position y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe need to have at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSo for turn index: let t = t1 + τ for τ from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t1, position y_{t1} = given, here y_4 =2.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, we have y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSo the actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 2}, and the last state is at turn t1 + H - 1 with y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, that means at turn t1, y_{t1} =9, but here y_4=2, not 9, so H>1.\n\nIf H=2, at turn t1 +1 =5, y_5=9.\n\nActions: one action at t1=4, a4, which leads to y5=9.\n\nSimilarly, if H=3, actions at t=4 and t=5, y6=9.\n\netc.\n\nMin H means min number of turns from start to reach y=9, so min k such that y_{4+k} =9 for k>=1, since at t=4 y=2.\n\ny_{4+k} =9 at turn t=4+k.\n\nThen the turn index for the state is from t=4 to t=4+k, so k+1 turns, but H is the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so for state at t1+H-1, so if we reach at turn T, then H = T - t1 +1.\n\nSince at turn t1, we are at y_t1, not necessarily 9.\n\nHere t1=4, y4=2.\n\nIf we reach at turn T, yT=9, then H = T - 4 +1.\n\nActions from a4 to a_{T-1}, number of actions is (T-1) - 4 +1 = T-4.\n\nBut H is the number of turns in the sequence, from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo for example, if we reach at turn 5, T=5, then H= (5-4)+1 =2, so turns t=4 and t=5, with y5=9.\n\nActions: only a4 at turn 4.\n\nIf reach at turn 6, H=3, actions at t=4 and t=5.\n\netc.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nI need to go from y=2 to y=9, so I need to move up 7 units, but since I can move at most +1 per turn, minimum moves if I go up every turn is 7 turns, so from turn 4, after 7 up moves, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut I might hit cars, so I need to check if that path is possible or if I need to detour or wait.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, it might take more turns, but we want min H, so we prefer to go up as much as possible.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row y=1 to 8, and for each turn, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nStart from turn t=4.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 4, so for turn T, ΔT = T-4.\n\nFor each freeway row k from 1 to 8.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1, one car left-moving, h=48, τ=83, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(ΔT), τ - s(ΔT)] = [48 - 36(ΔT), 83 - 36(ΔT)]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, but since span is [low, high], so low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor freeway 1, [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nWhich is 48 <= 36ΔT and 36ΔT <= 83? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n48 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 48 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT >= 2 since integer.\n\nAnd 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <= 2.\n\nΔT >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = 2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, ceil to 2.\n\nΔT <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2.\n\nSo for ΔT=2, both: at ΔT=2, low = 48-72= -24, high=83-72=11, so -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, low=48-36=12, high=83-36=47, 12<=0? 12>0, 0 not >=12, so 0 not in [12,47]\n\nAt ΔT=3, low=48-108= -60, high=83-108= -25, -60<=0<= -25? 0 > -25? -25 <0, so 0 not <= -25, no.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, turn T=4+2=6, occupied.\n\nFor freeway 1, occupied only at T=6.\n\nΔT=2, T=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, car (48,83,left,36), so same, occupied only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) so head h=0, tail τ=-11, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [12ΔT -11, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 12ΔT -11 <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nWhich is 12ΔT -11 <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so ΔT=0? But ΔT integer >=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=4, span [-11,0], -11<=0<=0, yes 0<=0 true.\n\n0 <= 12ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\n12ΔT -11 <=0 => ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so only ΔT=0.\n\nΔT=0: low= -11, high=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔT=1: low=12-11=1, high=12, 1<=0? 1>0, false.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, we are considering for collision at that turn.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (36,25,right,12) head h=36, tail τ=25? (36,25,right,12), so span at t1: [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt T: [25 +12ΔT, 36 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 25+12ΔT <=0 <=36+12ΔT\n\nBut 25+12ΔT >=25>0, so 0 < low, not <=, so never 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-48,-59,right,12) head h=-48, tail τ=-59, span [τ, h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -59+12ΔT <=0 <= -48+12ΔT\n\nLeft: -59+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12≈4.916, so ΔT<=4\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+12ΔT => 48 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT=4, low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, so -11<=0<=0 true.\n\nAt other times not.\n\nSo for freeway 3:\n\n- First car occupied at T=4 only\n\n- Second car never\n\n- Third car occupied at T=4+4=8\n\nAt T=4, first car has span [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nAt T=8, third car has span at ΔT=4, [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nBut for freeway 3, at a given turn, if any car has 0 in span, it is occupied.\n\nSo at T=4, occupied by first car.\n\nAt T=8, occupied by third car.\n\nAlso, other times? For example, ΔT=0, T=4.\n\nΔT=1: first car: [1,12] not include 0\n\nSecond: [37,48] no\n\nThird: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] no\n\nΔT=2: first: [24-11=13,24]? 12*2-11=24-11=13, 24, [13,24] no\n\nThird: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] no\n\nΔT=3: first: [36-11=25,36] no\n\nThird: [-59+36, -48+36]=[-23,-12] no\n\nΔT=4: first: [48-11=37,48]? 12*4-11=48-11=37,48 no\n\nThird: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] yes\n\nΔT=5: first: [60-11=49,60] no\n\nThird: [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12] no\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at T=4 and T=8.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars identical, so also occupied at T=4 and T=8.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) head h=-24, tail τ=-35, span [τ, h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -35+12ΔT <=0 <= -24+12ΔT\n\nLeft: -35+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12≈2.916, so ΔT<=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+12ΔT => 24 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT=2: low= -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so -11<=0<=0 true.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) head h=48, tail τ=37, span [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT], min 37>0, so never include 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 occupied only at ΔT=2, T=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, so occupied only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8, two cars with speed 4.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) head h=-48, tail τ=-59, span [τ, h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +4ΔT, -48 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -59+4ΔT <=0 <= -48+4ΔT\n\nLeft: -59+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/4=14.75, so ΔT<=14\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+4ΔT => 48 <=4ΔT => ΔT >=12\n\nSo for ΔT from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nAt ΔT=12: low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, -11<=0<=0 true\n\nΔT=13: low= -59+52= -7, high= -48+52=4, -7<=0<=4 true\n\nΔT=14: low= -59+56= -3, high= -48+56=8, -3<=0<=8 true\n\nΔT=15: low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, 1<=0 false\n\nSecond car on freeway 8: (16,5,right,4) head h=16, tail τ=5, span [τ, h] = [5,16]\n\nAt T: [5+4ΔT, 16+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 5+4ΔT <=0 <=16+4ΔT\n\nBut 5+4ΔT >=5>0, so never <=0, thus never include 0.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied only by first car when ΔT=12,13,14, i.e., T=16,17,18.\n\nT=4+12=16, 4+13=17, 4+14=18.\n\nNow, summarize for each row the turns when occupied:\n\ny=1: occupied at T=6\n\ny=2: no cars? Freeways from 1 to 8, y=2 is a freeway? Freeway k=1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to 8.\n\nBut y=2 has cars? In the car state, it lists freeway 1 to 8, but for freeway 2, it has a car same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: cars (48,83,left,36), so yes, y=2 has cars.\n\nI think I missed that.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1\n\nFreeway 2: y=2\n\nFreeway 3: y=3\n\netc.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway k, I assume k=1 is y=1, k=2 is y=2, up to k=8 is y=8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for y=1: freeway 1, occupied only at T=6\n\ny=2: freeway 2, car (48,83,left,36), same as y=1, so occupied only at T=6\n\ny=3: freeway 3, occupied at T=4 and T=8\n\ny=4: freeway 4, same as y=3, occupied at T=4 and T=8\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied only at T=6\n\ny=6: freeway 6, same, occupied at T=6\n\ny=7: freeway 7, same, occupied at T=6\n\ny=8: freeway 8, occupied at T=16,17,18\n\nNow, player starts at turn t=4, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which has no cars.\n\nNow, the path: we need to avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nThat is, for each turn, if we are on y, and y is occupied at that turn, collision.\n\nNow, since we move, we can choose to be on different y at different times.\n\nMinimal turns: we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=2, we need to go up to y=9, 7 steps up.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nFirst, at turn 4, we are on y=2.\n\nIs y=2 occupied at T=4? From above, y=2 occupied only at T=6, so at T=4, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow, we choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go up, so probably U.\n\nBut let's see the future.\n\nIf we go up every turn, starting from y=2 at T=4.\n\nAfter one up, at T=5, y=3.\n\nAt T=5, is y=3 occupied? y=3 occupied at T=4 and T=8, not at T=5, so safe.\n\nThen T=6, if we go up, y=4.\n\nBut at T=6, y=4: is it occupied? y=4 occupied at T=4 and T=8, not at T=6, so safe? T=6 not in occupied times.\n\ny=4 occupied only at T=4 and T=8, so at T=6, not occupied.\n\nBut at T=6, if we are on y=4, it should be fine.\n\nThen continue: T=6, y=4, action U, to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7, y=5: occupied? y=5 only at T=6, not T=7, so safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8, y=6: occupied? y=6 occupied only at T=6, not T=8, so safe? y=6 freeway, occupied at T=6 only.\n\nAt T=8, not occupied.\n\nThen action U, to y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9, y=7: occupied only at T=6, not T=9, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at T=10.\n\nT=10, y=8: occupied? y=8 occupied at T=16,17,18, not T=10, so safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn T=11.\n\nNow, H: since we reach at turn 11, t1=4, so T=11, H = T - t1 +1 =11-4+1=8.\n\nTurns from t=4 to t=11, that's 8 turns: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nAt t=11, y=9.\n\nActions from a4 to a10? Let's list the sequence.\n\nAt turn t=4, position y=2, choose action a4.\n\nIf a4=U, then y5=3.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, choose a5=U, y6=4.\n\nt=6, y=4, a6=U, y7=5.\n\nt=7, y=5, a7=U, y8=6.\n\nt=8, y=6, a8=U, y9=7.\n\nt=9, y=7, a9=U, y10=8.\n\nt=10, y=8, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nNow, at each turn, was there collision?\n\nt=4: y=2, occupied at T=6 only, not now, safe.\n\nt=5: y=3, occupied at T=4 and T=8, not T=5, safe.\n\nt=6: y=4, occupied at T=4 and T=8, not T=6, safe.\n\nBut y=4 is freeway 4, which is occupied at T=4 and T=8, not T=6.\n\nt=7: y=5, occupied only at T=6, not T=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, occupied only at T=6, not T=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, occupied only at T=6, not T=9, safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, occupied at T=16-18, not T=10, safe.\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and we reach in 8 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal? Since we must move up 7 times, and each action can move up at most one, so minimum 7 actions to increase by 7, so from y=2 to y=9, need at least 7 up moves, so at least 7 actions, reaching at turn 4+7=11, so H=8 turns as above.\n\nBut with 7 actions, we go from turn 4 to turn 11, state at turn 11.\n\nNumber of actions: 7 actions (a4 to a10) to reach y11=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, which is 8, from t=4 to t=11.\n\nSince we can stay, it might take more, but not less, so 8 is minimal possible if no obstacles.\n\nIn this case, with obstacles, we didn't hit any, so it should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the occupied times.\n\nFor example, at t=6, we are on y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, occupied at T=4 and T=8, not T=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, we are on y=6, which is freeway 6, occupied only at T=6, not T=8.\n\nt=8 is not T=6.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=6, we are on y=4, not on y=5 or something.\n\nIn the path: t=6, y=4.\n\nNow, is there a problem with other rows?\n\nAnother thing: at t=4, we are on y=2, which is occupied only at t=6, but at t=4 it is safe.\n\nBut at t=6, y=2 is occupied, but we are not on y=2 at t=6, we are on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo with 7 up moves, we can reach in 8 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, all actions are U.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial position.\n\nStart at t=4, y=2.\n\nAfter a4=U, at t=5, y=3.\n\na5=U, t=6, y=4.\n\na6=U, t=7, y=5.\n\na7=U, t=8, y=6.\n\na8=U, t=9, y=7.\n\na9=U, t=10, y=8.\n\na10=U, t=11, y=9.\n\nReach at t=11.\n\nH=8, since turns from t=4 to t=11, 8 states.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, and state at t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=4, H=8, t1+H-1=4+7=11, y11=9.\n\nActions from a4 to a10.\n\na4 to a10 is 7 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=8, actions at t=4 to t=4+7=11? No.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1 + 0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=4, H=8, so actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11? But that's 8 actions.\n\nBut after action at t=11, we go to y12, but we need to reach at turn t1+H-1=11, with y11=9.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nThe sequence of actions is applied at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after these actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, we start at position, choose action a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, choose a_{t1+1}, and so on, up to turn t1+H-1, we choose a_{t1+H-1}, and after that, at turn t1+H, we have y_{t1+H}, but we need y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nLet's read the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nNow, the actions are chosen at times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt time t, we choose action a_t, which determines the next position.\n\nSpecifically, at time t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at time t+1, we have position y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need that at time t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from time t1 to time t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t1, but we need y_{t1} =9, which may not be true.\n\nHere y4=2, not 9, so H>=2.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1? t from 0 to H-1=1, so actions at t1+0 and t1+1.\n\nBut action at t1+1 would affect y_{t1+2}, but we need y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+1} for H=2.\n\nSet T = t1 + H - 1, y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions are chosen at times from t1 to T-1, to go from y_t1 to y_T in T - t1 steps.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T-1, that's (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1 actions.\n\nThen H is such that T = t1 + H - 1, so T - t1 = H - 1.\n\nNumber of actions is H-1.\n\nIn this case, from t=4 to T=11, T - t1 =7, so 7 actions, H=8.\n\nActions at t=4 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=8, actions at t1 to t1+H-2? t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so for H=8, t from 0 to 7, actions at t1+0=4 to t1+7=11.\n\nBut action at t=11 would be to go to y12, but we need y11=9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the actions are for the turns where we move.\n\nStandard: at each turn, we choose action based on current position.\n\nWe need to specify actions from turn t1 to the turn before we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThen after action a_{t1+H-1}, we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, before any action, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nFor example, H=1, at turn t1, y_{t1}=9.\n\nH=2, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}=9, and actions at t1, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nSimilarly, H=3, at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2}=9, actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nIn general, actions at t1 to t1+H-2 determine the position up to y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nWith actions at t1 to t1+H-2, we have H-1 actions.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nFor the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, but for t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions, but we only need H-1 actions to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the indexing.\n\nLook at the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" with action at time t.\n\nSo at time t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at time t1, y_{t1} given.\n\nThen a_{t1} determines y_{t1+1}, a_{t1+1} determines y_{t1+2}, ..., a_{t1+k-1} determines y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe need y_{t1+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen the actions are a_{t1} to a_{t1+k-1}, number k actions.\n\nThen the turn when we reach is t1+k.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t1 to t1+k, so H = k+1.\n\nThen y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+(k+1)-1} = y_{t1+k} =9.\n\nAnd the actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, since t1+H-2 = t1+(k+1)-2 = t1+k-1, the last action.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, which would be a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, but a_{t1+H-1} determines y_{t1+H}, which is not needed.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T, yT=9, with T=t1+k.\n\nThen actions at t1 to t1+k-1.\n\nNumber of actions: k.\n\nH = k+1.\n\nActions in sequence: for t from 0 to H-2? Let's see the range.\n\nThe sequence is t=0 to H-1, but that would include up to a_{t1+H-1}, which is one too many.\n\nI think it's a off-by-one error in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps the actions are for the turns starting from t1, up to the action that gets us to y=9.\n\nIn this case, for our path, we reach at turn 11, so T=11, t1=4, so k=7, H=8.\n\nActions at t=4 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, H-1=7, so t=0 to 6, a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+6} = a4 to a10.\n\nYes, t from 0 to 6, that's 7 actions, a4 to a10.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1 =4+7=11, y11=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nIn the answer, for H=8, actions from a4 to a10, all U.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? For example, if we can go faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so from y=2 to y=9, min 7 moves up, so min reach at turn 11, H=8.\n\nIf we start from y=2 at t=4, after 7 ups, at t=11 y=9.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nBut in this path, at t=4, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nt=5, y=3, is y=3 occupied at t=5? No, only at t=4 and t=8.\n\nt=6, y=4, not occupied at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, y=4 is not occupied, but y=1 and y=2 are occupied at t=6, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is occupied at t=6, but we are on y=4 at t=6, not y=5.\n\nAt t=6, we are on y=4, which is fine.\n\nThen at t=7, we move to y=5, but at t=7, y=5 is not occupied, since occupied only at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list for each turn the y position and if occupied.\n\nTurn T | y_T | Occupied? | Safe?\n\nT=4: y=2, occupied? y=2 occ at T=6 only, no, safe\n\nT=5: y=3, occ? y=3 occ at T=4 and T=8, not T=5, safe\n\nT=6: y=4, occ? y=4 occ at T=4 and T=8, not T=6, safe\n\nT=7: y=5, occ? y=5 occ at T=6 only, not T=7, safe\n\nT=8: y=6, occ? y=6 occ at T=6 only, not T=8, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, occ? y=7 occ at T=6 only, not T=9, safe\n\nT=10: y=8, occ? y=8 occ at T=16-18, not T=10, safe\n\nT=11: y=9, no cars, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but no, since min 7 up moves.\n\nUnless we can start from higher, but y=2 to y=9, need +7.\n\nIf we move down, it takes more turns, so not better.\n\nSo this should be the minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 3 and 4, occupied at t=4 and t=8.\n\nAt t=4, we are on y=2, not on y=3 or 4, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, we are on y=6, not on y=3 or 4.\n\ny=6 at t=8 is safe.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nH=8.\n\nActions: all U from a4 to a10.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1=4 to t1+H-2=4+6=10? t1+H-2=4+8-2=10, yes a4 to a10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and in this case, no collisions.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=6? For example, when we are on y=4 at t=6, but y=5 is occupied at t=6, but since we are not on y=5 at t=6, we are on y=4, and we move to y=5 at t=7, when it is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, the note says that when you move to a new row, you are not on it until the next turn, so no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path if we skip some rows faster, but we can't, since only one move per turn.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupied times again.\n\nFor y=5: freeway 5, occupied at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, if we are on y=5, it would be collision, but in our path at T=6, we are on y=4.\n\nAt T=7, we are on y=5, but T=7, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother row: y=8 occupied late, but we reach early.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nSo for turn t1=4, action U.\n\nThen turn 5: U, turn 6: U, etc.\n\nUp to turn 10: U.\n\nActions at t=4 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, since t1=4, and H=8, actions for t=0 to 6 relative to t1.\n\nBut in the output, it should be listed as \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd that's 7 actions, but H=8, so up to a10.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn 4 to turn 10, which is 7 actions.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut H=8.\n\nTo confirm, with these actions, y5=3, y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we need to include the turn when we reach, but no, actions only.\n\nNow, but in the problem, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", with H=8, t from 0 to 7, so a4 to a11? But that would be 8 actions, but we only need 7.\n\nI think I should follow the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nFor H=8, t from 0 to 7, actions a_{4} to a_{11}.\n\nBut action a_{11} would determine y_{12}, but we need y_{11}=9.\n\nIf we set a_{11}, but y_{11} is already set by previous action.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nFor example, to have y_{11}=9, it must be that at turn 10, we are at y=8 or 9 or 10, and choose action to go to y=9.\n\nIf at turn 10, y=8, choose U to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nAction at turn 10 is a10, which is chosen at turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=8, actions from a_{t1 + t} t=0 to 7, so a4 to a11.\n\nBut a11 is at turn 11, which would determine y12, but we need y11=9, which is before a11.\n\nSo the actions should be up to a10 to reach y11=9.\n\nThus, for H=8, t from 0 to H-1=7, but that includes a11, which is extra.\n\nTherefore, I think the sequence should be for t=0 to H-2, but the problem says to H-1.\n\nPerhaps H is defined differently.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"turns\" include the starting turn.\n\nBut in this case, at turn t1, we are at y_t1, not necessarily 9.\n\nI think it's a mistake in the problem.\n\nTo resolve, let's assume that the sequence has H actions, but from the text, it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut with actions at those turns.\n\nFor the player, at turn t, we choose action a_t.\n\nThen after H turns, from turn t1 to t1+H-1, we have applied H actions, and we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo for example, if we want y_{t1+H-1}=9, then at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, and no action is taken at that turn for movement, but the action is chosen at that turn? Confusion.\n\nI think the standard way is: the actions are chosen at each turn except the last, but the last turn we are already there.\n\nBut in the problem, it includes actions up to turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor our case, to have y11=9, we need actions from t=4 to t=10.\n\nSo 7 actions.\n\nFor H=8, t from 0 to 7, that would be 8 actions, too many.\n\nPerhaps for this path, H should be 7, but y_{t1+H-1} = y_{4+6} =y10, but we need y11=9, so y10=8, not 9.\n\nIf H=7, y_{4+7-1}=y10=8, not 9.\n\nWe need y11=9, so T=11, H= T - t1 +1 =8.\n\nI think the best is to output the actions as per the sequence.\n\nSince in this case all actions are U, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps for the output, we list the actions from turn t1 to the turn before reaching.\n\nBut to follow the format.\n\nAnother thought: in the sequence, when we reach y=9 at turn T, we don't need an action at turn T, because we are already there.\n\nSo actions only from t1 to T-1.\n\nFor T=11, actions at t=4 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence for H, with y_{t1+H-1}=9, actions at t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nFor H=8, actions at t1 to t1+6.\n\nIn the {t=0 to H-1}, it should be t=0 to H-2 for the actions, but the range is to H-1.\n\nI think I should look for the answer format example, but there is none.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since we reach at turn 11, and H=8, the actions include a4 to a10, which is 7, but for t from 0 to 6, since H-1=7, t=0 to 6 is 7 values.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 inclusive is H values.\n\nFor H=8, t=0 to 7, 8 actions.\n\nBut we only need 7.\n\nI think there's a inconsistency.\n\nTo avoid, since all actions are U, and it works, I'll output the sequence as:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nIn the box, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after H turns, including start, we have reached.\n\nBut let's not waste time.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 8, occupied at T=16-18, which is late, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of moves required to increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 9 is 7 upward moves, as each move (U) increases y by 1. Thus, the earliest possible turn to reach y=9 is turn 11 (starting from turn 4, after 7 actions).\n\nThe sequence of actions is all U (up) from turn 4 to turn 10, resulting in:\n- At turn 4: y=2 → action U → y=3 at turn 5\n- At turn 5: y=3 → action U → y=4 at turn 6\n- At turn 6: y=4 → action U → y=5 at turn 7\n- At turn 7: y=5 → action U → y=6 at turn 8\n- At turn 8: y=6 → action U → y=7 at turn 9\n- At turn 9: y=7 → action U → y=8 at turn 10\n- At turn 10: y=8 → action U → y=9 at turn 11\n\nCollision checks for each turn and position confirm no collisions occur:\n- Turn 4 (y=2): Freeway 2 occupied only at turn 6; safe.\n- Turn 5 (y=3): Freeway 3 occupied at turns 4 and 8; not turn 5; safe.\n- Turn 6 (y=4): Freeway 4 occupied at turns 4 and 8; not turn 6; safe.\n- Turn 7 (y=5): Freeway 5 occupied only at turn 6; not turn 7; safe.\n- Turn 8 (y=6): Freeway 6 occupied only at turn 6; not turn 8; safe.\n- Turn 9 (y=7): Freeway 7 occupied only at turn 6; not turn 9; safe.\n- Turn 10 (y=8): Freeway 8 occupied at turns 16–18; not turn 10; safe.\n- Turn 11 (y=9): No cars; safe.\n\nSince 7 upward moves are necessary and no fewer turns are possible, \\(H = 8\\) (turns 4 to 11). The sequence of actions is all U for turns 4 to 10.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The y-coordinate changes by +1, -1, or 0 accordingly, and must stay within [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0. Note: the player is on freeway y at turn T if the player's y-coordinate at the end of turn T (i.e., at the beginning of turn T+1) is y? But note the update:\n\nThe player update is: at turn t, we take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1}. So at the end of turn t (which is the start of turn t+1) we are at y_{t+1}. Therefore, during turn t, we are at y_t (the starting position of the turn) and then we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". But note: the player is on freeway y_T at turn T? Actually, the rule says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". This implies that during turn T, the player is still on the freeway corresponding to the starting y (which is y_T) until the move is done. Therefore, at turn T, the player is on the freeway of the starting y, i.e., y_T.\n\nSo for a turn T, the player starts at y_T and then moves to y_{T+1}. The collision check at turn T is for the freeway y_T (the starting freeway) and requires that at turn T, the car on freeway y_T must not have a span that includes 0.\n\nImportant: the cars move continuously. The car update is given for any T > t1. We are starting at turn t1=5.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 5 to turn 5+H-1 such that at the end of turn 5+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nNote: at turn 5, we start at y=3. Then we take an action a_5 and go to y_6, then at turn 6 we take a_6 and go to y_7, etc. until we reach y_{5+H} = 9. But note: the last action is taken at turn 5+H-1, and then we are at y_{5+H}. We require that at the end of turn 5+H-1 (i.e., at the start of turn 5+H) we are at y=9.\n\nSo we are to compute a sequence of H actions: a_5, a_6, ..., a_{5+H-1} that takes us from y_5=3 to y_{5+H}=9, without colliding on any turn.\n\nHow to check collision at a turn T?\n- At turn T, we start at y_T (which is the freeway we are on for that turn, unless y_T=0 or y_T=9? but note freeways are y=1..8, so if y_T=0 or 9, then no car to collide? Actually, the freeways are only from 1 to 8. So if the player is at y=0 or y=9 at the start of turn T, then there is no freeway at that row? So no collision? But note: the goal is to reach (0,9). When we are at (0,9), we are done. And at turn T when we are at y_T=0 or 9, we don't have to worry about cars.\n\nHowever, note: we might be at an intermediate freeway row (1 to 8) and then we must check the car on that row.\n\nGiven the car state at turn 5 (t1=5), we can compute the car's span at any turn T>=5.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T0 = 5.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn 5: \n  - It has a head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n  - For a left-moving car: at turn T (>=5), the span becomes [h - s*(T-5), tau - s*(T-5)].\n  - For a right-moving car: [tau + s*(T-5), head + s*(T-5)]? But note the given update for right: \n      \"Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n    because at t1: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the representation in the table for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, the update rule for right-moving says: \n    Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut wait: in the table for freeway 3, we have: (12, 1, right, 12). \n  So at turn 5: head=12, tail=1? Then the span at turn 5 is [1,12] (since for right-moving, the tail is the left end and head is the right end). \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: (12,47,left,36) -> at turn5: [12,47] (because head is the left end and tail the right? Actually, the update says: \n    Left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway1: (12,47,left,36) -> so h=12, tau=47? Then the car at turn5 is from 12 to 47? That's a long car (36 units) and moving left, so at T=5: [12,47] -> at T=6: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11], etc.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that 0 is in the span at turn T? So we need to check for each freeway k that we are on at turn T, if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe are to avoid any turn T (from 5 onward) where we are on a freeway k (so y_T = k, which is between 1 and 8) and there is at least one car on freeway k for which 0 is in [low, high] (the span at turn T).\n\nHow to compute the car spans at a given turn T for a freeway k?\n\nWe have the list of cars per freeway. We must check every car on that freeway at turn T? Actually, the cars are moving independently, and we have the state at turn 5. So for a given freeway k and a turn T, we can compute the span of each car at turn T.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"for any car on freeway i\", meaning the cars that are present on that freeway? And we are given the state at turn5. So we assume that the cars listed for freeway k are the only ones? And they are moving with constant speed.\n\nSo for freeway k, we have a list of cars. For each car, we compute its span at turn T. Then we check if 0 is in any of these spans.\n\nNow, the goal: start at y5=3, and we want to go to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn T if at that turn T, the car on that row has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the number of turns (actions). So we want the shortest path from y=3 to y=9 in the grid of rows 0 to 9, with constraints on when we can be on a row (1-8) without collision.\n\nBut note: the constraints are time-dependent! The car positions change with time. So we have to consider the state (y, t) where t is the turn (starting at t=5 for our initial state). \n\nWe can model this as a graph search in (y, t) states. But note that t can be large? However, we are going from y=3 to y=9, and we can move at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 6 moves (if we go up every time: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves). But we might have to wait sometimes to avoid collisions, so H might be more.\n\nWe are to minimize H, so we start by trying H=6? then H=7, etc.\n\nBut note: the car movements are linear in time, so we can compute for any future turn T the state of the cars.\n\nWe'll try to do a BFS in the state space (y, t) where t is the current turn (starting at t=5, y=3). We want to reach (y=9, any t). We consider actions U, D, S (if they keep y in [0,9]). We check for each state (y, t) whether we are safe: if y is 0 or 9, then safe (no car). If y is between 1 and 8, then we check the freeway y at turn t: for each car on freeway y, compute its span at turn t and see if 0 is in any span.\n\nNote: at state (y, t), we are at the start of turn t (so we are about to take an action a_t). Then we move to y_{t+1} = y + delta, and then we are at state (y_{t+1}, t+1). But the collision check for turn t is done at the start of the turn? Actually, the rule says: collision occurs at turn T if ... for the freeway y_T. And at the start of turn T, we are at y_T. So when we are at state (y, t), we are at the start of turn t, and we must check for collision at this turn? \n\nBut note: we have not taken the action for turn t yet. However, the collision rule applies during the turn? The rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\". And we are on freeway y_T at the beginning of the turn. So we must check the car on freeway y (which is the row we are currently on) at the current turn t.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (y, t), we must check: if y is in {1,2,...,8}, then we are on a freeway and we must check the cars on that freeway at turn t: if any car has 0 in its span at turn t, then this state is unsafe -> we cannot be here.\n\nBut note: we start at (3,5). We must check at turn5, freeway3: are there any cars on freeway3 at turn5 that have 0 in their span?\n\nSo let's compute for freeway3 at turn5:\n\nFreeway3 has three cars:\n1. (12, 1, right, 12) -> at turn5: the car is right-moving, so the span at turn5 is [tail + s*(0), head + s*(0)]? But note: T-t1 = T-5. For T=5, T-5=0. So:\n   For right-moving: [tau + s*0, head + s*0] = [1,12]. Is 0 in [1,12]? No.\n2. (48, 37, right, 12): [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48].\n3. (-36, -47, right, 12): [-47, -36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36].\n\nSo at (3,5) we are safe.\n\nNow, we can take an action at turn5: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, so we would prefer to move up. But we must avoid collisions in future turns.\n\nWe'll do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1) in (y,t) states.\n\nWe'll start from (3,5) and then expand to next states:\n\nAction U: next y = 4, next turn = 6 -> state (4,6)\nAction S: next y = 3, next turn = 6 -> state (3,6)\nAction D: next y = 2, next turn = 6 -> state (2,6)\n\nBut note: when we are at state (4,6), we must check at turn6, freeway4? because at the start of turn6 we are at y=4 (which is freeway4) -> so we check freeway4 at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,6): check freeway3 at turn6.\nFor (2,6): check freeway2 at turn6.\n\nWe continue until we reach a state (9, t) for some t.\n\nWe are to minimize t - 5 (the number of turns). Since we are starting at turn5, and the first action is at turn5, then we do H actions: from turn5 to turn5+H-1, and we are at y_{5+H}=9 at the start of turn5+H? Actually, note:\n\nAt turn5: we start at y5=3. Then we take an action at turn5 -> we end up at y6. Then at turn6: we start at y6, and so on.\n\nSo after H actions, we have taken actions at turns 5,6,...,5+H-1, and then we are at y_{5+H}. We require y_{5+H}=9.\n\nSo the state we are looking for is (9, 5+H) meaning at the start of turn 5+H we are at y=9. But note: we don't have to take an action at turn5+H because we have already reached. So H is the number of actions, and the last action is taken at turn5+H-1.\n\nIn the BFS, we start at (3,5) and we want to reach (9, t) for some t>=5. The minimal t-5 is the minimal H? Actually, the number of actions is (t - 5) because from turn5 to turn t, we have taken t-5 actions. But note: at the start of turn5, we haven't taken any action. Then we take an action at turn5 and move to turn6, so one action. Then at the start of turn t, we have taken t-5 actions. So if we are at (9, t), then we have taken t-5 actions, so H = t-5.\n\nTherefore, we want the minimal t such that we can reach (9,t) and the path is safe.\n\nWe'll do BFS over t (time) and y (from 0 to 9). Since t is increasing, we can do a BFS by increasing time.\n\nWe'll keep a visited set for (y,t) to avoid cycles. But note: we might need to wait (by staying) so we might have the same y at consecutive t. However, if we are stuck in a cycle (like staying forever) then we will break by the fact that we are making no progress? But we are going to y=9, so we will eventually move up. Also, we can bound t: since we can always wait until the cars are gone? but the cars move at constant speed and the grid is infinite? Actually, the car positions are linear in time, so we can compute the next time when a car is blocking a row? But note: we are only concerned with whether 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the times T (>=5) when 0 is in the car's span? Then for each freeway k, we get a set of dangerous time intervals (or a set of dangerous turns). Then at a state (y,t) we check if y is a freeway and if t is a dangerous time for freeway y.\n\nBut note: a freeway k might have multiple cars, so the dangerous times for freeway k is the union of the dangerous times of all cars on k.\n\nSo let's precompute the dangerous intervals for each freeway k (1..8).\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\nCase 1: left-moving car (d='left'): \n   Car at turn T: [h - s*(T-5), tau - s*(T-5)]\n   We require that 0 is in [h - s*(T-5), tau - s*(T-5)].\n   Since the car is moving left, we have h <= tau? In the example: freeway1: (12,47,left,36) -> so h=12, tau=47. Then at T, the car is [12-36*(T-5), 47-36*(T-5)].\n   We need: 12-36*(T-5) <= 0 <= 47-36*(T-5)\n\n   Solve:\n      Lower bound: 12 - 36*(T-5) <= 0  => 12 <= 36*(T-5) => T-5 >= 12/36 = 1/3 => T>=5.333 -> so T>=6 (since T integer) for the lower bound to be <=0? Actually, we need both conditions.\n\n   Actually, we need:\n      A: h - s*(T-5) <= 0   => T-5 >= ceil(h/s) if s>0? But note: we have an interval.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n      h - s*(T-5) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-5)\n\n   => \n        h - s*(T-5) <= 0  => T-5 >= h/s   [if s>0, which it is]\n        and \n        0 <= tau - s*(T-5) => s*(T-5) <= tau => T-5 <= tau/s.\n\n   So T must be in [5 + h/s, 5 + tau/s]. Since T is integer, we take T in [ceil(5+h/s), floor(5+tau/s)]? But note: if the car is long, then the interval might be non-empty.\n\n   However, note: for the left-moving car (12,47,left,36):\n        T-5 >= 12/36 = 1/3 -> so T>=6 (since T integer) \n        T-5 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305 -> so T<=5+1.305=6.305 -> T<=6.\n\n   So only T=6.\n\n   Check at T=6: \n        [12-36*1, 47-36*1] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes.\n\n   So freeway1 is dangerous at T=6.\n\n   Similarly, freeway2 has the same car: (12,47,left,36) -> dangerous at T=6.\n\nCase 2: right-moving car (d='right'):\n   Car at turn T: [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)]\n   We require: tau + s*(T-5) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-5)\n\n   So:\n        tau + s*(T-5) <= 0  => s*(T-5) <= -tau  => T-5 <= -tau/s   [note: tau might be negative?]\n        and \n        0 <= h + s*(T-5) => T-5 >= -h/s\n\n   But note: the example car on freeway3: (12,1,right,12): \n        tau=1, h=12, s=12.\n        Then:\n            T-5 <= -1/12 -> T-5 <= -0.083 -> T<=4.917 -> T<=4? but T>=5 -> no solution? \n        Check: at T=5: [1+0,12+0] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]. \n        At T=4: [1-12,12-12] = [-11,0] -> then 0 is in [-11,0]? But we start at T=5, so we don't consider T=4.\n\n        So no danger.\n\n   Another car on freeway3: (48,37,right,12): \n        tau=37, h=48, s=12.\n        Conditions: \n            T-5 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> T<=1.92 -> not in [5,infty) -> safe.\n\n   And the third: (-36,-47,right,12): \n        tau=-47, h=-36, s=12.\n        Conditions:\n            T-5 <= -(-47)/12 = 47/12 ≈ 3.916 -> T<=8.916 -> T<=8? (since integer)\n            and T-5 >= -(-36)/12 = 36/12=3 -> T>=8.\n        So T in [8,8] -> T=8.\n\n        Check at T=8: \n            [-47 + 12*(8-5), -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes.\n\n        So freeway3 is dangerous at T=8? But wait, we have multiple cars: so freeway3 has three cars, and one of them is dangerous at T=8.\n\n   Therefore, freeway3 is dangerous at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every car on every freeway.\n\nLet me do it systematically:\n\nFreeway1: only one car: (12,47,left,36) -> dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway2: same car: (12,47,left,36) -> dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway3: \n   Car1: (12,1,right,12) -> safe for T>=5? \n        Condition: T-5 <= -1/12 -> T<=5-0.083 -> T<=4.917 -> no T>=5 -> safe.\n   Car2: (48,37,right,12) -> \n        T-5 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> T<=1.92 -> no T>=5 -> safe.\n   Car3: (-36,-47,right,12) -> \n        T-5 >= 3 and T-5<= 47/12≈3.916 -> T in [8,8] -> dangerous at T=8.\n\n   So freeway3 is dangerous at T=8.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? \n   Cars: (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n   So dangerous at T=8.\n\nFreeway5: \n   Cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n   For the first car: (-12,-23,right,12): \n        tau = -23, h = -12, s=12.\n        Conditions:\n            T-5 <= -(-23)/12 = 23/12 ≈ 1.916 -> T<=6.916 -> T<=6? \n            T-5 >= -(-12)/12 = 12/12=1 -> T>=6.\n        So T=6.\n        Check at T=6: [-23+12*1, -12+12*1] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> dangerous at T=6.\n\n   Second car: (60,49,right,12):\n        tau=49, h=60, s=12.\n        Conditions: T-5<= -49/12≈-4.08 -> no T>=5 -> safe.\n\n   So freeway5 dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? -> dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway5? -> dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway8: \n   Cars: (-44,-55,right,4), (20,9,right,4)\n   First car: (-44,-55,right,4): \n        tau=-55, h=-44, s=4.\n        Conditions:\n            T-5 <= -(-55)/4 = 55/4=13.75 -> T<=18.75 -> T<=18\n            T-5 >= -(-44)/4 = 44/4=11 -> T>=16\n        So T in [16,18]? But let me compute:\n\n        We need: \n            -55 + 4*(T-5) <= 0  => 4*(T-5) <= 55 -> T-5 <= 55/4=13.75 -> T<=18.75 -> T<=18 (integer)\n            and \n            0 <= -44 + 4*(T-5) => 44 <= 4*(T-5) => T-5>=11 -> T>=16.\n\n        So T in {16,17,18}\n\n        Check T=16: [-55+4*(11), -44+44] = [-55+44,0] = [-11,0] -> 0 in? yes.\n        T=17: [-55+48, -44+48] = [-7,4] -> 0 in? no? wait, 0 is between -7 and 4? yes, 0 is in [-7,4] -> dangerous.\n        Actually, at T=16: [ -55+4*11 = -55+44=-11, -44+44=0] -> [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included (at the endpoint).\n        At T=17: [ -55+4*12 = -55+48=-7, -44+48=4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> yes.\n        At T=18: [ -55+4*13=-55+52=-3, -44+52=8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> yes.\n\n        But wait: the condition for the car is that the span includes 0. So at T=16: the span is [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes.\n        Similarly for T=17 and T=18.\n\n        However, note the representation: for a right-moving car, the span is [tail + s*(T-5), head + s*(T-5)]? \n        But in the problem, the car is defined by (head, tail, ...). For the first car: head=-44, tail=-55? \n        Then the initial span at T=5: [tau, head] = [-55, -44]? \n        Then at T=5: [ -55, -44] -> 0 not in.\n        At T=6: [ -55+4, -44+4] = [-51, -40] -> no.\n        ...\n        At T=16: [ -55 + 4*(11) = -55+44=-11, -44+44=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in? yes.\n\n        So dangerous at T=16,17,18.\n\n   Second car: (20,9,right,4):\n        tau=9, h=20, s=4.\n        Conditions:\n            T-5 <= -9/4 = -2.25 -> T<=2.75 -> no T>=5 -> safe.\n\n   So freeway8 dangerous at T=16,17,18.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: {6}\nFreeway2: {6}\nFreeway3: {8}\nFreeway4: {8}\nFreeway5: {6}\nFreeway6: {6}\nFreeway7: {6}\nFreeway8: {16,17,18}\n\nNow, we can do a BFS from (3,5). We want to reach (9, t) for some t.\n\nWe consider the state (y,t) and we try actions U, D, S (if they don't take y out of [0,9]).\n\nThe next state is (y_next, t+1) where:\n   if action U: y_next = min(9, y+1)\n   if action D: y_next = max(0, y-1)\n   if action S: y_next = y\n\nBut note: we must check the state (y,t) for safety: if y is between 1 and 8, then we check if t is in the dangerous set for freeway y.\n\nWe start at (3,5): \n   y=3 (freeway3) -> dangerous at t=8? 5!=8 -> safe.\n\nThen we consider:\n\nAt (3,5): we can do:\n   U -> (4,6)\n   S -> (3,6)\n   D -> (2,6)\n\nNow check each:\n\n(4,6): y=4, t=6 -> freeway4: dangerous at t=8? 6 not in {8} -> safe? \n   But wait: freeway4 is dangerous at t=8, not at t=6 -> safe.\n\n(3,6): freeway3: dangerous at t=8? 6!=8 -> safe.\n\n(2,6): freeway2: dangerous at t=6 -> yes! t=6 is in {6} for freeway2 -> unsafe. So we cannot be at (2,6).\n\nSo we discard (2,6).\n\nNow from (4,6): \n   Actions: \n        U: (5,7)\n        S: (4,7)\n        D: (3,7) -> but note: from 4 to 3? \n\n(5,7): freeway5: dangerous at t=6? 7!=6 -> safe? But wait: freeway5 dangerous at t=6 only? Then at t=7, safe? -> safe.\n(4,7): freeway4: dangerous at t=8? 7!=8 -> safe.\n(3,7): freeway3: dangerous at t=8? 7!=8 -> safe.\n\nFrom (3,6): \n   Actions:\n        U: (4,7) -> already considered? but same state (4,7) at t=7.\n        S: (3,7)\n        D: (2,7) -> freeway2 at t=7: dangerous at t=6? 7 not in {6} -> safe.\n\nBut note: we must avoid duplicates? We'll do BFS by increasing t.\n\nWe'll maintain a queue: (y, t, path) and we start at (3,5, []). Then we expand.\n\nWe want minimal H = t - 5 when we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll generate states in order of increasing t.\n\nWe start:\n\nt=5: only (3,5)\n\nt=6: \n   from (3,5): \n        U: (4,6) -> safe? yes -> add\n        S: (3,6) -> safe? yes -> add\n        D: (2,6) -> unsafe (freeway2 at t=6 is dangerous) -> discard.\n\n   So states at t=6: (4,6) and (3,6)\n\nt=7:\n   from (4,6):\n        U: (5,7) -> freeway5 at t=7: safe (dangerous only at t=6) -> add\n        S: (4,7) -> freeway4: safe -> add\n        D: (3,7) -> freeway3: safe -> add\n\n   from (3,6):\n        U: (4,7) -> already generated? but we can have multiple paths to same state? we should avoid duplicates? but same state (y,t) should be processed once? \n        But we are doing BFS by time, so we will generate (4,7) twice? We can use a visited set for (y,t). We mark state (y,t) as visited when we first get it? But we want the minimal t? and we are doing by increasing t, so the first time we get to (y,t) is the earliest. So we can mark visited.\n\n   So let's use a visited set: if we have seen (y,t) then skip.\n\n   So for (3,6):\n        U: (4,7) -> if we haven't visited (4,7) then add, but we already generated from (4,6) -> so if we mark (4,7) as visited when we first generate it? Actually, we haven't processed t=7 yet. We are generating for t=7 from t=6 states.\n\n   We can generate all states for t=7 and then mark them as visited for the next time.\n\n   Alternatively, we can allow multiple entries? but that might cause infinite loops? but we are going upward so we will eventually reach 9.\n\n   To avoid duplicates, we can store a set of visited states (y,t). When we generate a state (y,t) that we have already seen at the same t? but we generate each state only once per (y,t). So we can mark (y,t) as visited.\n\n   So from (3,6):\n        U: (4,7) -> if we haven't seen (4,7) then add -> we haven't seen any state at t=7 yet? So we add (4,7) but then we already generated one from (4,6). But we can avoid duplicate by checking: when we generate (4,7) from (4,6), we mark it. Then when we generate (4,7) again from (3,6), we skip.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        Queue: initially (3,5, path=[])\n        Then we generate for (3,5): \n            (4,6, [U])\n            (3,6, [S])\n            (2,6) -> discard.\n\n        Now we have two states at t=6.\n\n        Then we process (4,6): \n            (5,7, [U,U])\n            (4,7, [U,S])\n            (3,7, [U,D])\n\n        Then we process (3,6): \n            U: (4,7) -> already generated? we have (4,7) from (4,6) -> so skip?\n            S: (3,7) -> already generated? we have (3,7) from (4,6) -> skip?\n            D: (2,7) -> not generated? then we generate (2,7, [S,D])\n\n        Then we have at t=7: (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7)\n\n        Now we check safety for (2,7): freeway2 at t=7: dangerous set {6} -> 7 not in -> safe.\n\n        Then we continue.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n   Let dist[y][t] = minimal steps to get to (y,t) from (3,5) or infinity, and we store the action sequence? Actually, we store the path.\n\n   Alternatively, we do BFS by time (since each move increases time by 1). We start at t=5, then t=6, then t=7, etc.\n\n   We'll use a queue: each element (y, t, path) where path is the list of actions so far (from turn5 to turn t-1).\n\n   We start: (3,5, [])\n\n   Then for each state, we generate next states for t_next = t+1, and y_next in {y-1, y, y+1} (if within [0,9]), and then check if the state (y,t) is safe? But note: we are at the start of turn t, and we are about to take an action. The safety check is for the current state (y,t): we must be safe at turn t.\n\n   However, we already did the safety check when we entered the state? Actually, when we generate a state (y,t), we must check if it is safe? Yes: if y in [1,8] and t is in the dangerous set for freeway y, then we skip.\n\n   But note: the start state (3,5) was safe.\n\n   Then we generate next states, and then when we generate (y_next, t+1), we check the safety of (y_next, t+1) only if we are going to use it? Actually, no: we are generating the state (y_next, t+1) and then we check its safety at turn t+1? But wait: the safety of the state (y,t) is checked when we are at the start of turn t. Then we take an action and move to (y_next, t+1). Then at the start of turn t+1, we are at y_next and we check safety for turn t+1.\n\n   Therefore, when we generate a state (y,t), we check its safety at that moment.\n\n   So in the BFS, when we pop a state (y,t) from the queue, we then generate the next states (y_next, t+1) and then for each (y_next, t+1) we check if it is safe? and if we haven't visited (y_next, t+1) before, we add it.\n\n   But note: we might get to (y,t) by multiple paths? but we are storing per (y,t) so we only process each (y,t) once.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n   Let Q be a queue.\n   Let visited be a set of (y,t).\n\n   Start: \n        Q.enqueue( (3,5, []) )\n        visited.add( (3,5) )\n\n   while Q not empty:\n        (y, t, path) = Q.dequeue()\n        if y == 9: \n            then we found a solution: H = len(path) [because we took len(path) actions to get from (3,5) to (9, t) and t=5+len(path)].\n            then output the path.\n\n        Otherwise, for each action a in [U, D, S]:\n            y_next = y + delta(a)   [clamped to [0,9]]\n            t_next = t+1\n            state_next = (y_next, t_next)\n\n            If we have not visited (y_next, t_next):\n                Then we check the safety of state_next: \n                    If y_next is 0 or 9 -> safe.\n                    Else (y_next in 1..8): check if t_next is in the dangerous set for freeway y_next -> if yes, then skip; else safe.\n                If safe, then:\n                    new_path = path + [a]\n                    If y_next==9: then we output new_path and H=len(new_path) and break.\n                    Else: \n                        visited.add( (y_next, t_next) )\n                        Q.enqueue( (y_next, t_next, new_path) )\n\n   Since we are doing BFS by time, the first time we reach (9, t) will be the minimal H.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple paths to (9,t) but we break at the first one because it's BFS and time increases by 1 each step, so the first time we get to 9 is the minimal H.\n\nHowever, we must note that we can also wait? but we are expanding in time order, so we will get the minimal t.\n\nNow, let's run the BFS until we reach y=9.\n\nWe have dangerous sets:\n\nf1: {6}\nf2: {6}\nf3: {8}\nf4: {8}\nf5: {6}\nf6: {6}\nf7: {6}\nf8: {16,17,18}\n\nWe start:\n\nLevel 0: t=5, y=3, path=[].\n\nLevel 1: t=6, \n   from (3,5): \n        a=U: y_next=4 -> (4,6): safe? freeway4: dangerous at t=8? 6 not in -> safe. -> new state: (4,6, ['U'])\n        a=S: y_next=3 -> (3,6): freeway3: dangerous at t=8? 6 not in -> safe. -> (3,6, ['S'])\n        a=D: y_next=2 -> (2,6): freeway2: dangerous at t=6 -> skip.\n\nLevel 2: t=7, \n   from (4,6, ['U']):\n        a=U: y_next=5 -> (5,7): freeway5: dangerous at t=6? 7 not in -> safe. -> (5,7, ['U','U'])\n        a=S: y_next=4 -> (4,7): freeway4: safe -> (4,7, ['U','S'])\n        a=D: y_next=3 -> (3,7): freeway3: safe -> (3,7, ['U','D'])\n\n   from (3,6, ['S']):\n        a=U: y_next=4 -> (4,7): not visited? we haven't generated (4,7) from the first one? Actually we have (4,7) from (4,6) by action S. So we mark visited for (4,7) and skip.\n        a=S: y_next=3 -> (3,7): we have generated from (4,6) by action D? so skip.\n        a=D: y_next=2 -> (2,7): freeway2: dangerous at t=6? 7 not in -> safe. -> (2,7, ['S','D'])\n\nLevel 3: t=8,\n   from (5,7, ['U','U']):\n        a=U: y_next=6 -> (6,8): freeway6: dangerous at t=6? 8 not in -> safe. -> (6,8, ['U','U','U'])\n        a=S: y_next=5 -> (5,8): freeway5: dangerous at t=6? 8 not in -> safe. -> (5,8, ['U','U','S'])\n        a=D: y_next=4 -> (4,8): freeway4: dangerous at t=8 -> yes -> skip.\n\n   from (4,7, ['U','S']):\n        a=U: y_next=5 -> (5,8): safe? freeway5: safe -> but we already generated (5,8) from above? so skip.\n        a=S: y_next=4 -> (4,8): dangerous -> skip.\n        a=D: y_next=3 -> (3,8): freeway3: dangerous at t=8 -> skip.\n\n   from (3,7, ['U','D']):\n        a=U: y_next=4 -> (4,8): dangerous -> skip.\n        a=S: y_next=3 -> (3,8): dangerous -> skip.\n        a=D: y_next=2 -> (2,8): freeway2: dangerous at t=6? 8 not in -> safe. -> (2,8, ['U','D','D'])\n\n   from (2,7, ['S','D']):\n        a=U: y_next=3 -> (3,8): dangerous -> skip.\n        a=S: y_next=2 -> (2,8): safe? freeway2: dangerous set {6} -> safe -> (2,8, ['S','D','S'])\n        a=D: y_next=1 -> (1,8): freeway1: dangerous at t=6? 8 not in -> safe? -> (1,8, ['S','D','D'])\n\nLevel 4: t=9,\n   from (6,8, ['U','U','U']):\n        a=U: y_next=7 -> (7,9): freeway7: dangerous at t=6? 9 not in -> safe. -> (7,9, ['U','U','U','U'])\n        a=S: y_next=6 -> (6,9): freeway6: safe -> (6,9, ['U','U','U','S'])\n        a=D: y_next=5 -> (5,9): freeway5: safe -> (5,9, ['U','U','U','D'])\n\n   from (5,8, ['U','U','S']):\n        a=U: y_next=6 -> (6,9): safe -> (6,9, ['U','U','S','U']) -> but we already have a state (6,9) from above? so skip if we mark visited.\n        a=S: y_next=5 -> (5,9): safe -> (5,9, ['U','U','S','S'])\n        a=D: y_next=4 -> (4,9): safe -> (4,9, ['U','U','S','D'])\n\n   from (2,8, ['U','D','D']): \n        a=U: y_next=3 -> (3,9): freeway3: dangerous at t=8? 9 not in -> safe? but note: at t=9, we are on freeway3? no, we are at y=3 at the start of turn9? and freeway3 is row3 -> so we check freeway3 at t=9: dangerous set {8} -> safe. -> (3,9, ['U','D','D','U'])\n        a=S: y_next=2 -> (2,9): freeway2: safe -> (2,9, ['U','D','D','S'])\n        a=D: y_next=1 -> (1,9): freeway1: safe -> (1,9, ['U','D','D','D'])\n\n   from (2,8, ['S','D','S']): \n        same as above: but we already have (2,8) in the visited set? so we skip generating the same state? but we are generating next states from (2,8) with different paths? Actually, we store per (y,t) so we already processed (2,8) from the first path? So we skip the second path to (2,8) at the same t? But we did: we generated (2,8) from (2,7) by action S. Then we generated (2,8) again from (3,7) by action D? But we skipped because we marked (2,8) as visited when we first generated it? \n\n        So we only have one (2,8) state? \n\n   from (1,8, ['S','D','D']):\n        a=U: y_next=2 -> (2,9): safe -> (2,9, ['S','D','D','U'])\n        a=S: y_next=1 -> (1,9): safe -> (1,9, ['S','D','D','S'])\n        a=D: y_next=0 -> (0,9): but wait, we are at y=1, D: y_next=0 -> (0,9) -> but we want (0,9) as the goal? Actually, the goal is (0,9) meaning the player is at (0,9). But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\". And at (0,9), we are done. \n\n        However, note: the grid: the vertical axis is y=0,1,...,9. And the freeways are y=1..8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\n        But we require the player to be at (0,9). So when we are at (0,9), we have reached the goal? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\". So we must be at x=0 (which is fixed) and y=9.\n\n        So at (0,9): we are done.\n\n        However, note: the goal is (0,9). The player starts at (0,3). The x-coordinate never changes. So we only care about y.\n\n        Therefore, when we get to y=9, we are done.\n\n        But note: the goal is (0,9) and we are always at x=0. So when we are at y=9, we are at (0,9).\n\n        Therefore, we can reach the goal at (9, t) for any t? \n\n        So at this state: (0,9) is not generated by D from (1,8) because D from 1 goes to 0? and 0 is not 9. \n\n        Actually: from (1,8): \n            D: y_next = 1-1 = 0 -> state (0,9). But we want y=9, not y=0.\n\n        So we must go to y=9.\n\n        Therefore, from (1,8): \n            U: y_next=2 -> (2,9) -> safe, but not 9.\n            S: y_next=1 -> (1,9) -> safe, but not 9.\n            D: y_next=0 -> (0,9) -> safe, but not 9.\n\n        So we don't reach goal from (1,8) at t=9.\n\n   We continue.\n\n   At t=9, we have states: \n        (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9)\n\n   None of these is y=9? So we haven't reached the goal.\n\nLevel 5: t=10,\n   We'll only consider states that might lead to 9.\n\n   For example, from (7,9): \n        a=U: y_next=8 -> (8,10): freeway8: dangerous set {16,17,18} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n        a=S: y_next=7 -> (7,10): freeway7: dangerous set {6} -> safe.\n        a=D: y_next=6 -> (6,10): freeway6: safe.\n\n   Similarly, from (6,9): \n        U: (7,10)\n        S: (6,10)\n        D: (5,10)\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n   We note that we can move up from 7 to 8 at t=10? then from 8 to 9 at t=11.\n\n   But we can also move up from 5,6, etc.\n\n   However, we are doing BFS and we want the minimal H. We are at t=10, which is 5 steps from start. We started at t=5, so 5 steps: t=10 -> H=5? but we haven't reached 9 yet.\n\n   Actually, H is the number of actions. We started at turn5 and we are at the start of turn10 -> we have taken 5 actions.\n\n   We want to be at y=9 at the start of some turn T. The minimal T is what we are looking for.\n\n   We note: the minimal number of moves to go from 3 to 9 is 6 (because 9-3=6). So we cannot do it in 5 moves. The states at t=11 (6 moves) might reach 9.\n\n   At t=10, we are at the start of turn10, and we have taken 5 actions. Then we take one more action at turn10 to get to turn11.\n\n   So we are looking for t=11: y=9.\n\n   We can get to y=9 at t=11 by:\n\n      From (7,10): \n          U: y_next=8 -> (8,11) -> then we must check freeway8 at t=11: dangerous set {16,17,18} -> 11 not in -> safe.\n          Then from (8,11): \n               At turn11: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: safe? yes.\n               Then at turn11, we can take action U: to go to 9 at turn12.\n\n      Or from (8,10): \n          U: y_next=9 -> (9,11): goal? \n          But wait: we are at (8,10) at the start of turn10? Then we take U at turn10: then at the start of turn11, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\n      How to get to (8,10)? \n          We see at t=10, we have:\n              (7,10): can move U to (8,11) -> but that's at t=11.\n              (8,10): we don't have yet.\n\n      How to get to (8,10)? \n          We can get from (7,9) at t=9: \n              At t=9: (7,9): then at turn9: we take action U: y_next=8 -> state (8,10) at the start of turn10.\n\n          Then from (8,10): at turn10 we take U: y_next=9 -> (9,11).\n\n      But that takes 6 actions: \n          t5: start at 3\n          t6: ... \n          t9: at 7\n          t10: at 8 (by U from 7 at turn9)\n          t11: at 9 (by U from 8 at turn10)\n\n      So 6 actions.\n\n      But we have a path that goes to 9 at t=11? \n\n      Alternatively, we might have a shorter path? minimal moves is 6, so 6 actions.\n\n      But let me see if we can reach 9 in 6 actions (so t=11).\n\n      How about:\n\n          Path: U, U, U, U, U, U: \n             t5: 3 -> U: t6:4\n             t6:4->U: t7:5\n             t7:5->U: t8:6\n             t8:6->U: t9:7\n             t9:7->U: t10:8\n             t10:8->U: t11:9\n\n          We need to check safety at each state:\n\n            t5: (3,5): safe.\n            t6: (4,6): safe.\n            t7: (5,7): safe (freeway5: dangerous only at t=6)\n            t8: (6,8): safe (freeway6: dangerous only at t=6)\n            t9: (7,9): safe? at the start of turn9 we are at y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at t=6? safe.\n            t10: (8,10): freeway8: dangerous set {16,17,18} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n            t11: (9,11): goal.\n\n          So this path works: actions: U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\n          But wait: at t10 we are at (8,10) and we take U to go to 9 at t11.\n\n          The actions are for turns: \n                turn5: U\n                turn6: U\n                turn7: U\n                turn8: U\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n\n          So 6 actions.\n\n          We also had a path that went to 7 at t9? but that also takes 6 actions to get to 9 at t11.\n\n          But this one is 6 actions and we don't have to go to 7? Actually, we do: \n              after 4 U's: at t9 we are at 7, then U to 8 at t10, then U to 9 at t11.\n\n          So it's 6 actions.\n\n      But note: we can also move faster? but 6 is the minimum.\n\n      However, we might have a path that uses fewer than 6 actions? no, because we need to move 6 steps up.\n\n      So the minimal H is 6.\n\n      But note: we might have to detour? but that would take more actions.\n\n      Therefore, we can output the path: \n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n\n      But wait: we must check if any state along the way is unsafe.\n\n      We already did:\n\n          t5: (3,5) -> safe.\n          t6: (4,6) -> freeway4: safe.\n          t7: (5,7) -> freeway5: safe.\n          t8: (6,8) -> freeway6: safe.\n          t9: (7,9) -> freeway7: safe? yes, because dangerous only at t=6.\n          t10: (8,10) -> freeway8: safe.\n\n      So we are safe.\n\n      But note: at t9: we are at y=7 -> freeway7. The dangerous set for freeway7 is {6}. So t9=9 is not 6 -> safe.\n\n      Therefore, this path is valid.\n\n      But wait: at t8: we are at (6,8): freeway6: dangerous set {6} -> but 8!=6 -> safe.\n\n      So the sequence is: \n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n\n      But note: after 6 actions, we are at the start of turn 11 at y=9.\n\n      The actions are taken at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10 -> 6 actions.\n\n      So H=6.\n\n      Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n\nBut wait, we have an alternative that might be shorter? We don't, because 6 is minimal.\n\nHowever, note: we might be able to go faster by not going straight? but we can't.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path that takes 6 actions but avoids some potential danger? but we didn't encounter any danger.\n\nAlternatively, we might have a path that goes up then down then up? that would be longer.\n\nSo we choose the straight up path.\n\nBut note: the freeway3 at t=8 is dangerous? but in this path we are not on freeway3 at t=8: at t8 we are at y=6 -> freeway6.\n\nSo we avoid the danger at freeway3 at t=8 by being at freeway6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at t=6: we are at freeway5 at t=7? but that's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn 10, and then at the start of turn 11 we are at y=9.\n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} with t1=5. \n   So t=0: a_{5+0}=a5\n   t=1: a6\n   ...\n   t=5: a10\n\nSo 6 actions: from t=0 to t=5.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, the format: we start at turn5 and then do actions at turn5, turn6, ... turn10.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the car movements? Specifically, at turn6, we are at freeway4: which is safe. But what about freeway4 at turn6? We computed that freeway4 is dangerous at t=8, not t=6. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at turn7: safe because dangerous only at t=6.\n\nfreeway6 at turn8: safe because dangerous only at t=6.\n\nfreeway7 at turn9: safe.\n\nfreeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 6 U's.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn 5 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8, the optimal sequence of actions is to move up (U) at every turn. This sequence ensures the player moves directly from y = 3 to y = 9 in 6 turns, which is the minimal possible since the vertical distance is 6 units and each move up covers one unit.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 5, the player is at y = 3. Moving up to y = 4.\n- At turn 6, the player is at y = 4. Moving up to y = 5.\n- At turn 7, the player is at y = 5. Moving up to y = 6.\n- At turn 8, the player is at y = 6. Moving up to y = 7.\n- At turn 9, the player is at y = 7. Moving up to y = 8.\n- At turn 10, the player is at y = 8. Moving up to y = 9.\n\nCollision checks at each turn confirm safety:\n- Turn 5 (y = 3): Freeway 3 is dangerous only at turn 8. Safe.\n- Turn 6 (y = 4): Freeway 4 is dangerous only at turn 8. Safe.\n- Turn 7 (y = 5): Freeway 5 is dangerous only at turn 6. Safe.\n- Turn 8 (y = 6): Freeway 6 is dangerous only at turn 6. Safe.\n- Turn 9 (y = 7): Freeway 7 is dangerous only at turn 6. Safe.\n- Turn 10 (y = 8): Freeway 8 is dangerous at turns 16, 17, 18. Safe.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns H is 6, and the sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,4) at turn t1=6 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its state at turn t1=6: head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction \"left\" means it's moving left (negative x-direction), and \"right\" means moving right (positive x-direction). The span is [head, tail] for left-moving cars or [tail, head] for right-moving? No, let's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving cars: at turn T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] where (h, τ) is at t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for the same (h, τ) at t1.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T. That is, if the car covers x=0 at time T.\n\nAlso, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, I move from y_T to y_{T+1}, I'm only on y_T during turn T, and y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe collision check is at each turn T: if I'm on freeway y_T, then check if any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nNow, current turn is t1=6, I'm at y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least the vertical distance: from y=4 to y=9, I need to go up 5 units, so minimum 5 turns if I always go up. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut let's see the car states to see if I can go directly up.\n\nFirst, list all cars per freeway at t1=6.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSince it's left-moving, at time T, span is [h - s(T-6), τ - s(T-6)] = [-24 -36(T-6), 11 -36(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on each freeway I might be on.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at t=6, and I need to be at y=9 at some future turn.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=6.\n\nAt turn t=6, I'm at y=4.\n\nI need to choose actions for t=6, t=7, etc., until I reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t=6 to when I reach y=9, so if I reach at turn t=6+H-1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=5, I reach at t=10.\n\nNow, for each possible path, I need to ensure that at each turn, when I'm on a freeway, no car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nAlso, since cars move continuously, I need to compute for each turn T, the span of each car at time T.\n\nTime T is in turns, so T=6,7,8,... are integer turns.\n\ns is speed, which is distance per turn, I assume, so for each turn increase, the car moves s units.\n\nNow, let's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36\n\nAt time T, span: left endpoint: h - s(T-6) = -24 -36(T-6)\n\nRight endpoint: τ - s(T-6) = 11 -36(T-6)\n\nSince left-moving, the span is [min, max] but since it's moving left, head is left, tail is right, I think. The notation says for left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], with h and τ, but in this case h=-24, τ=11, so at t1, [ -24, 11], which is from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nThen at T, [ -24 -36(T-6), 11 -36(T-6) ]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-24,11,left,36) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h]? Let's see the rule: for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the description: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo for freeway 3:\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) — but τ and h, which is tail and head? At t1, [τ, h] = [13,24]? I think τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, head is to the right, tail left.\n\nIn the state: it says \"cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for right-moving, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end.\n\nSo at t1, for right-moving, span is [τ, h].\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head h is left end, tail τ right end, span [h, τ] at t1, then [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] at T.\n\nNow for freeway 3 cars:\n\nCar1: h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=12 → at t1, [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 + 12(T-6), 24 + 12(T-6)]\n\nCar2: (60,49,right,12) → τ=49, h=60? Head=60, tail=49, so at t1, [49,60]\n\nAt T, [49 + 12(T-6), 60 + 12(T-6)]\n\nCar3: (-24,-35,right,12) → head=-24, tail=-35? Tail=-35, head=-24, so at t1, [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, [-35 + 12(T-6), -24 + 12(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — identical.\n\nFreeway 5: (0,-11,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nCar1: head=0, tail=-11, right, s=12 → at t1, [-11,0]\n\nAt T, [-11 + 12(T-6), 0 + 12(T-6)]\n\nCar2: head=-48, tail=-59, right, s=12 → at t1, [-59,-48]\n\nAt T, [-59 + 12(T-6), -48 + 12(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: also same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 8: (-40,-51,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nCar1: head=-40, tail=-51, right, s=4 → at t1, [-51,-40]\n\nAt T, [-51 + 4(T-6), -40 + 4(T-6)]\n\nCar2: head=24, tail=13, right, s=4 → at t1, [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 + 4(T-6), 24 + 4(T-6)]\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe direct path would be to go up each turn: U,U,U,U,U, so in 5 turns, from t=6 to t=10, at t=10, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn and each y I'm on, if there is a collision.\n\nAt turn t=6, I start at y=4, so I need to check freeway y=4 at t=6.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: let's find if for any car, 0 in span at t=6.\n\nFor freeway 4:\n\nCar1: at t=6, [13,24], 0 not in [13,24]\n\nCar2: [49,60], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [-35,-24], 0 not in\n\nSo no collision at t=6 on y=4.\n\nNow, if I go up at t=6, to y=5 at t=7.\n\nAt turn t=7, I will be on y=5? At turn t=6, I choose action, which determines y at t=7.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, during turn t, I am on freeway y_t.\n\nThen, at the end of the turn, or during, collision is checked based on cars at time t.\n\nThe player update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen, for collision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: when you move to a new y, you are not on it until the next turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, I choose a_6.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_7 = 5.\n\nAt turn t=6, I am on y=4, so check collision on freeway 4 at t=6: as above, no car has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I am on y=5.\n\nNow, freeway 5: at t=7, I need to check if 0 in span for cars on y=5 at time t=7.\n\nFreeway 5 cars at time T=7.\n\nt1=6, so T-6=1.\n\nCar1: [-11 + 12(1), 0 + 12(1)] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nCar2: [-59 +12(1), -48+12(1)] = [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at t=7 on y=5.\n\nIf I go up again, a_7=U, then y_8=6.\n\nAt t=8, on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=8.\n\nSimilar to freeway 5, since same cars? Freeway 6 has same as freeway 5? From above, freeway 5,6,7 all have the same cars? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 5: (0,-11,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (0,-11,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12) — yes, identical.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nSo at t=8, on y=6, freeway 6 cars at T=8, T-6=2.\n\nCar1: [-11 +12*2, 0+12*2] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen go up, a_8=U, y_9=7.\n\nAt t=9, on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=9, T-6=3.\n\nCar1: [-11 +12*3, 0+36] = [-11+36, 36] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen go up, a_9=U, y_10=8.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (-40,-51,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nAt T=10, T-6=4.\n\nCar1: head=-40, tail=-51, right, s=4 → at T, [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-51 +4*4, -40 +16] = [-51+16, -40+16] = [-35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: head=24, tail=13, right, s=4 → [13 +4*4, 24 +16] = [13+16, 24+16] = [29,40], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at t=10, y=8, if I go U, y_11=9, but I need to reach y=9, so at turn t=10, I am at y=8, not 9.\n\nIf I go U at t=10, y_11=9, so I reach at turn t=11.\n\nBut with actions starting from t=6.\n\nLet's list:\n\nt=6: y=4, choose a6\n\nt=7: y=5, choose a7\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y = y_{t1} + sum of Δy, but since we start at t=6, after H actions, we are at turn t=6 + H, and y at that turn.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1 + H - 1, so H actions, from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y is set.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe player position at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nAt turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}).\n\nWe choose actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}, then at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nFor example, if H=0, we are at t1, but y=4 ≠9, so not.\n\nMinimal H such that after H actions, y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=4, need to increase by 5, so H at least 5.\n\nIf I go U each time, after 5 actions: t=6 to t=10, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=6, after action a6, y7 = y6 + Δy6.\n\nAt turn t=6, before action, y=4.\n\nAfter action a6, y7 is set.\n\nThen at turn t=7, y= y7, and so on.\n\nSo at turn t=6, we have y6=4.\n\nAfter a6, y7.\n\nAt turn t=7, y= y7, after a7, y8, and so on.\n\nWe want for some H, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=6.\n\nSo at turn t=6 + H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=5, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10, then at turn t=11, y=9? No.\n\nStart: turn t=6, y=4.\n\nAction a6: if U, then y7=5\n\nTurn t=7, y=5\n\nAction a7: U, y8=6\n\nTurn t=8, y=6\n\nAction a8: U, y9=7\n\nTurn t=9, y=7\n\nAction a9: U, y10=8\n\nTurn t=10, y=8\n\nAction a10: U, y11=9\n\nTurn t=11, y=9\n\nSo to reach y=9 at turn t=11, I need actions from t=6 to t=10, H=5 actions.\n\nBut at turn t=10, I am at y=8, not 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=5, actions at t=6 to t=10, then at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions until we reach.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nNow, in this path, I was at:\n\nt=6: y=4, on freeway 4, safe as before\n\nt=7: y=5, on freeway 5, at t=7: car1 [1,12], 0 not in; car2 [-47,-36], no, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, on freeway 6 at t=8: car1 [13,24], 0 not; car2 [-35,-24], 0 not? -35 to -24, 0 not in, yes.\n\nt=9: y=7, on freeway 7 at t=9: car1 [25,36], no; car2 [-23,-12], no\n\nt=10: y=8, on freeway 8 at t=10: car1 [-35,-24], no; car2 [29,40], no\n\nAll safe, and at t=11, y=9, which is the top, no freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, no car there, so when we reach y=9, we don't need to check, I think.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nSo with H=5, actions: U,U,U,U,U for t=6 to t=10.\n\nt=6 to t=10 inclusive? Actions for t=6, t=7, t=8, t=9, t=10.\n\nIn the sequence: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so for H=5, a6 to a10.\n\nThen at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", meaning at some turn, y=9.\n\nAnd collision only on freeways 1-8.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut is there a faster way? H=5 is minimum since distance is 5.\n\nCould I reach in fewer? No, because I start at y=4, need to go to 9, each up increases by 1, so at least 5 ups, so at least 5 actions, H=5.\n\nIf I go down, it would take more turns, so H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, with U all the way, it seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the cars, especially at the turns.\n\nFor example, at t=7 on y=5: freeway 5 car1 at t=7: [ -11 +12(7-6), 0 +12(1) ] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut freeway 8 at t=10: car1 [-51 +4*(10-6), -40 +4*4] = [-51+16, -40+16] = [-35,-24]\n\nCar2 [13+16,24+16]=[29,40]\n\n0 not in.\n\nBut is there a car that might hit at different times?\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, car1: at t=6, [ -11 +0, 0+0] = [-11,0], so at t=6, 0 is in the span? x=0 is in [-11,0], since -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt t=6, on freeway 5, car1 has span [-11,0], so 0 is in it, meaning if I am on y=5 at t=6, I collide.\n\nBut at t=6, I am on y=4, not y=5.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at t=7, not t=6.\n\nAt t=7, as above, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFor example, freeway 4 at t=6: cars have spans not including 0, as I said.\n\nBut let me list for each freeway, when 0 is in the span for some car.\n\nFor freeway 1: left-moving car, span at T: [ -24 -36(T-6), 11 -36(T-6) ]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -24 -36(T-6) <= 0 <= 11 -36(T-6)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -24 -36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 11 -36ΔT, where ΔT = T-6.\n\n-24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3, but ΔT >=0 since T>=6, so always true for ΔT>=0? -24 -36ΔT <=0 => -36ΔT <=24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36ΔT >= -24, so ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3, and since ΔT>=0, always true.\n\nThen 0 <= 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so for ΔT=0, T=6.\n\nAt T=6, min= -24, max=11, 0 is between, yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1, min= -24-36= -60, max=11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, only at T=6, 0 in span for freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, I don't care unless I am on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3: cars:\n\nCar1: right, at T, [13 +12ΔT, 24+12ΔT], 0 in if 13+12ΔT <=0 <=24+12ΔT, but 13+12ΔT >0 for ΔT>=0, so never.\n\nCar2: [49+12ΔT, 60+12ΔT], all positive, no.\n\nCar3: [-35+12ΔT, -24+12ΔT], 0 in if -35+12ΔT <=0 <= -24+12ΔT\n\nLeft: -35+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=35/12≈2.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo for ΔT=2, T=8: min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nFor ΔT=3, min= -35+36=1, max= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSo on freeway 3, at T=8, car3 has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same as 3.\n\nNow freeway 5: car1: [-11+12ΔT, 0+12ΔT], at T.\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max.\n\nmin = -11+12ΔT, max=12ΔT\n\nSo -11+12ΔT <=0 <=12ΔT\n\nLeft: -11+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/12≈0.916, so for ΔT=0\n\nRight: 0 <=12ΔT always for ΔT>=0 except ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, min=-11, max=0, so 0 included, yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1, min=1, max=12, 0 not.\n\nCar2: [-59+12ΔT, -48+12ΔT], both negative for small ΔT, 0 not in since max negative until ΔT large.\n\n-59+12ΔT <=0 <= -48+12ΔT\n\nLeft: -59+12ΔT <=0 => ΔT <=59/12≈4.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+12ΔT => 12ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT=4, T=10: min= -59+48= -11, max= -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor ΔT=5, min= -59+60=1, max= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 and 7, same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: car1: right, [-51 +4ΔT, -40 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in: -51+4ΔT <=0 <= -40+4ΔT\n\nLeft: -51+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=51 => ΔT <=51/4=12.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -40+4ΔT => 4ΔT >=40 => ΔT >=10\n\nSo for ΔT=10, min= -51+40= -11, max= -40+40=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor ΔT=11, min= -51+44= -7, max= -40+44=4, [-7,4], 0 in? -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\n-7 <=0 <=4, true.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nΔT=10: min=-51+40= -11, max=-40+40=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=11: min=-51+44= -7, max=-40+44=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔT=12: min=-51+48= -3, max=-40+48=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔT=13: min=-51+52=1, max=-40+52=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [13+4ΔT, 24+4ΔT], all positive, min=13+4ΔT >=13>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, car1 has 0 in span for ΔT from 10 to 12, i.e., T=16 to 18? T=6+10=16 to 6+12=18.\n\nΔT=10,11,12: T=16,17,18.\n\nBut we are going to t=11 or so, not that late.\n\nIn my earlier path, I was on y=8 at t=10, which is ΔT=4, not 10, so no issue.\n\nBack to my direct path: going up from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps: actions U at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=6: y=4, on freeway 4, at T=6: cars not at 0, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, on freeway 5, at T=7: car1 [1,12], 0 not in; car2 [-47,-36]? At T=7, ΔT=1, car1: [-11+12,12]=[1,12], yes; car2: [-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, on freeway 6, at T=8: car1 [-11+24,24]=[13,24], 0 not; car2 [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, on freeway 7, at T=9: car1 [-11+36,36]=[25,36], no; car2 [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12], 0 not, safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, on freeway 8, at T=10: car1 [-51+4*4, -40+16]= [-51+16,-24]= [-35,-24], 0 not; car2 [13+16,24+16]=[29,40], no, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9, done.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in H=5.\n\nBut why is there a car on freeway 5 at t=6 with 0 in span? But I'm not on it at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, other dangerous times.\n\nBut in this path, I avoid all.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but H=5 is minimal.\n\nUnless I can reach in fewer actions, but no, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nS might keep y same, but that would increase H, so not better.\n\nSo minimal H=5 with U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway at t=10 for y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 car1 at t=10: ΔT=4, [-51 +4*4, -40 +16] = [-51+16, -24] = [-35,-24], yes.\n\n-35 to -24, 0 not in.\n\nBut is there any other car? Only two.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait somewhere.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nMaybe on the way, some freeway is dangerous at certain times.\n\nFor example, if I were on y=5 at t=6, I would collide, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, on y=6 at t=8, freeway 3 and 4 have car3 at t=8 with 0 in span, but I'm on y=6 at t=8, not y=3 or 4.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=8 is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think the direct path works.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5, actions: U at each turn from t=6 to t=10.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since t1=6)\n\nIn the sequence, for t=6 to t=10.\n\nt1=6, so:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut in the box, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=5.\n\nBut let me see if there is a way with H<5, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by going up faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5,6,7, they are all the same, so symmetric.\n\nSimilarly for 3 and 4.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nAnother thing: when I go from y to y+1, I am not on y+1 during the turn, so for example, when I move from y=4 to y=5 at turn t=6 (by choosing U), at turn t=6, I am on y=4, then at t=7, on y=5.\n\nIn collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, so when I am moving, during the turn, I am on the starting y.\n\nWhich is fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: at (0,4), turn t1=6.\n\nAnd cars given.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at some point I need to avoid.\n\nFor example, suppose I want to go to y=5 earlier or something, but I start at y=4.\n\nPerhaps if I stay or go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor instance, if on some freeway there is a car at certain time, but in this path, no collision.\n\nSo I think H=5 with all U is the way.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: U  (which is turn 6)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U  (turn 7)\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U  (turn 8)\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U  (turn 9)\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U  (turn 10)\n\nWith H=5.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut in the box, it should list the actions.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 1: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 2: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 3: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 4: U }\n\nSince t1=6, but I think it's fine to use t_1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns: after these 5 actions, at turn t1+5 =11, y=9.\n\nt1+H =6+5=11, y=9.\n\nAnd during turns 6 to 10, no collision.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in 4 actions? Impossible, since y from 4 to 9, difference 5, need at least 5 ups.\n\nIf I start at y=4, after one action, y=5 at turn 7, after two, y=6 at turn 8, ..., after five actions, y=9 at turn 11.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 5. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 4\\), increasing the y-coordinate by 1 each turn, resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 5 = 11\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n- At turn \\(t = 6\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 4\\). The cars on freeway 4 at \\(t = 6\\) have spans: \\([13, 24]\\), \\([49, 60]\\), and \\([-35, -24]\\), none of which contain 0, so no collision.\n- At turn \\(t = 7\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 5\\). The cars on freeway 5 at \\(t = 7\\) have spans: \\([-11 + 12(1), 0 + 12(1)] = [1, 12]\\) and \\([-59 + 12(1), -48 + 12(1)] = [-47, -36]\\), neither containing 0.\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 6\\). The cars on freeway 6 at \\(t = 8\\) have spans: \\([-11 + 12(2), 0 + 12(2)] = [13, 24]\\) and \\([-59 + 12(2), -48 + 12(2)] = [-35, -24]\\), neither containing 0.\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). The cars on freeway 7 at \\(t = 9\\) have spans: \\([-11 + 12(3), 0 + 12(3)] = [25, 36]\\) and \\([-59 + 12(3), -48 + 12(3)] = [-23, -12]\\), neither containing 0.\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at \\(t = 10\\) have spans: \\([-51 + 4(4), -40 + 4(4)] = [-35, -24]\\) and \\([13 + 4(4), 24 + 4(4)] = [29, 40]\\), neither containing 0.\n\nAt turn \\(t = 11\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which has no freeway and thus no collision risk.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 5\\) turns, as any fewer turns would require moving more than 1 unit per turn, which is impossible given the movement constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,5). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (which correspond to y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the y-direction. The x-coordinate is always 0.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (where y is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only on freeway y_T during turn T. So at turn T, we check for collision on freeway y_T. If we move, then at turn T+1 we are on freeway y_{T+1} and we check that.\n\nWe start at turn 7 at y=5. We need to get to y=9. Since we can only move one step at a time, the minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 4 moves (from 5 to 6, then 7, then 8, then 9). However, we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=7. For each freeway and each car, we have:\n  (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nNote: The representation for left-moving and right-moving:\n  - Left-moving: the car moves to the left (negative x direction). The span at time t1 is [h, τ] and then at time T (T>t1) it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n  - Right-moving: the car moves to the right. The span at time t1 is [τ, h] (note: head is the larger coordinate) and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, the way the cars are given in the table, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36). This is a left-moving car. At t1=7, the span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. But note: the head is the front of the car? Actually, for left-moving, the head is the rightmost point (since it's moving left) and tail is the leftmost? But the span is given as [h, τ] and then moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car, like on freeway 3: (36,25,right,12) -> the head is 36 and tail 25? But note the span for right-moving is given as [τ, h] = [25,36] at t1=7? Actually, the problem says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h]. So in the input, the first number is the head and the second is the tail? But then for right-moving, the head is the front (which is the rightmost) and tail is the leftmost? So the span is [tail, head].\n\nBut in the example: (36,25,right,12) -> so head=36, tail=25. Then the span at t1=7 is [25,36]. Then at time T, the car moves right: so the span becomes [25 + 12*(T-7), 36 + 12*(T-7)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: (-60,-25,left,36): head=-60, tail=-25? Then the span at t1=7 is [-60, -25]. Then at T, it becomes [-60 - 36*(T-7), -25 - 36*(T-7)].\n\nWe are to simulate from turn t1=7 (current) to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (1..8) when there is a car on that freeway whose span at that turn includes 0.\n\nLet's list the freeways we care about: we start at y=5 and need to go to y=9. So we will be on freeways 5,6,7,8 and then 9 (but note: freeway 9 is the goal and there are no cars on freeway 9 because cars are only on 1..8). Also, we might go down to 4 or below? But we are at 5 and need to go up to 9. So ideally we go up, but if there is a car blocking, we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid? But going down would be away from the goal. We must minimize the number of turns.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement from turn 7 onward. We need to check for each freeway we are on at a given turn whether there is a car that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nWe are given the state at turn 7. We'll compute the car positions at any turn T (>=7) by:\n  T_rel = T - 7\n\nFor a left-moving car (d='left') at freeway k:\n  span at T = [h - s * T_rel, τ - s * T_rel]\n\nFor a right-moving car (d='right'):\n  span at T = [τ + s * T_rel, h + s * T_rel]\n\nCollision at turn T on freeway k if the player is on y=k at turn T and there exists a car on freeway k such that the span at T includes 0.\n\nIncluding 0 means: the span [A, B] (with A<=B) must satisfy A <= 0 <= B.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) in the state space. The state is (turn, y). The turn starts at 7 and y at 5. We want to reach y=9 at any turn. We consider actions U, D, S. The turn increases by 1 for each action.\n\nBut note: the turn count: at the starting turn (7) we are at y=5. Then we take an action at turn 7 to move to turn 8 and update y. So the state at turn 7 is the starting state. Then we take an action at turn 7 to get to turn 8 with a new y.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at turn t1 (which is 7) for H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence is for t = t1 to t1+H-1? The problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So at step t=0 (which is t1) we take the first action, then t=1 (t1+1) the next, until t=H-1 (t1+H-1). Then at turn t1+H, we would be at the next state? But note: the player update: at turn t, we do action a_t, then at turn t+1 we have the new y.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So we are to be at y=9 at the moment after the last action? Actually, the sequence of actions is taken from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t1 (7) is y=5. Then we take an action at turn 7, which leads to y at turn 8? But note the update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn 7, we are at y_7=5. Then we choose a_7, which then sets y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nTherefore, we are at y=5 at the start of turn 7. Then we choose an action (U, D, S) which will determine y_8.\n\nWe want that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? Actually, the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). But note: at the start of a turn, we are at a position. Then we take an action. So if we are at y=9 at the start of turn T, we don't need to take an action? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at the start of turn T? And the actions are taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, meaning we take H actions? Then the state after the H actions is at turn t1+H, and we are at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". This is ambiguous. Let me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}. Then we take a_{t1} (which is the first action) and then we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nThen at the start of turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. Then we take a_{t1+1} to get y_{t1+2}, etc.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H} = 9? But the last action is a_{t1+H-1} which leads to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nAnd the turn when we are at (0,9) is turn t1+H? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). This is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But then why would we take an action at turn t1+H-1? We don't need to.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at the end of these actions, at the start of the next turn (t1+H) we are at y_{t1+H}. But we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be the state at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nLet me clarify with an example: \n  At turn t1=7, we start at y=5. \n  If H=1: then we take 0 actions? But the sequence is for t=0 to H-1=0? That would be one action: at t1+0=7. Then after that action, we are at y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7. We want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 7? But at the start of turn 7 we are at 5, not 9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action we are at (0,9) at the turn when the action was taken? But note the collision condition: at a turn T, we are on y_T. So at the start of turn T, we are at y_T, and we take an action. Then during the turn T, we are present on freeway y_T? And we check collision at turn T (so at the start of the turn, we are at y_T, and then we move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn? But the collision condition says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo during turn T, we are on freeway y_T. Therefore, we must avoid collision at every turn T from t1 to the turn when we leave the freeways.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the start of some turn T. Note that y=9 is not a freeway with cars (cars are on 1..8). So once we are at y=9, we are safe. And we don't need to move further.\n\nTherefore, we are done when we are at y=9 at the start of a turn. We don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions is taken until the state at the start of a turn is y=9? Actually, we take actions until we have reached the goal. The last action is taken at the turn when we are not at y=9, and that action moves us to y=9 at the next turn? Or we might be at y=9 at the start of a turn without taking an action that turn? But we start at y=5 (at turn 7) which is not 9.\n\nSo the goal is to be at y=9 at the start of some turn T. We take actions at turns 7, 8, ... until we are at y=9 at the start of a turn. The number of actions is the number of turns we take an action. The last action we take is at turn T-1, which moves us from y_{T-1} to y_T=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is taken from turn 7 to turn T-1 (inclusive). Then at turn T, we are at y=9 and we stop.\n\nTherefore, the total number of actions H = T - 7. And we want to minimize H.\n\nIn the answer, we output the actions from turn 7 to turn T-1.\n\nNow, we must avoid collision at every turn from 7 to T-1 (because at each of these turns, we are on some freeway y, which is between 0 and 8, but note: freeway 0 and 9 are safe because no cars? Actually, the problem says cars are on freeways y=1,...,8. So if we are on y=0 or y=9, no collision. But at the start of turn 7, we are at y=5 (which is freeway 5) so we must check collision at turn 7? Yes.\n\nSo at every turn from 7 to T-1 (the start of these turns) we are at some y, and if y is between 1 and 8, we must check that no car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe'll simulate the cars for each freeway and each car at turn T (relative T_rel = T-7).\n\nWe are going to use BFS:\n\nState: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 7) and y is the current y-coordinate.\n\nWe start at (7,5). We want to reach a state (T,9) for some T>=7.\n\nFrom state (t, y), we can take actions: U, D, S, leading to next state (t+1, y') where:\n  if U: y' = min(y+1,9) [since bounded by 0 and 9? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and we are bounded to [0,9]. So if y=9, then U would still leave at 9? But we are starting below 9. Similarly, D: y'=max(0, y-1). But we are going upward so D might not be needed? But sometimes we may need to retreat.\n\nBut note: we are at y=5 and goal is 9, so moving down would be counterproductive. However, if there is a long obstacle above, we might have to wait by moving down? But we can also wait by staying. So D might not be necessary? However, we'll consider all three.\n\nBut to minimize H, we prefer U and S. D would increase the steps. So we might avoid D if possible.\n\nWe'll generate states (turn, y) and record the action taken to get there and the previous state.\n\nWe must avoid states that we have already visited with a higher or equal turn? But we are looking for minimal turns. So we can use a visited array: visited[y][t] but t can be large? However, the problem is that the cars are moving continuously and the spans change. But note: the cars are moving at constant speeds and the system is linear. Moreover, the car positions are periodic? Because the road is infinite? But the collision condition only matters when the car spans include 0. And since the cars are moving at constant speeds, the pattern of when a car covers 0 is periodic.\n\nBut the speeds are given: 36, 12, 4, etc. We can compute for each freeway the time intervals when 0 is covered by at least one car.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (in terms of T, absolute turn) when the car's span includes 0.\n\nBut note: the turn T is an integer. So we are only checking integer turns.\n\nFor a car, we can compute the times T (>=7) for which 0 is in the span.\n\nFor a left-moving car: \n  span at T: [h - s*(T-7), τ - s*(T-7)]\n  Condition: h - s*(T-7) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-7)   -> but note: the head is the right end? Actually, for left-moving, the head is the right end? But the span is [h, τ] at T=7? And then moves left. But note: if h < τ? In the example: freeway1: h=-60, τ=-25 -> so h < τ? That would be a problem because the interval [h,τ] is from -60 to -25, which is increasing? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then moves left. But if h is the head (which is the front) then for left-moving, the head should be the rightmost? So if the car is moving left, the head is at -25 and the tail at -60? But the problem writes: (-60, -25, left, 36). So the first number is head? Then head=-60, tail=-25. Then the span is [h,τ] = [-60, -25] -> which is from -60 (left) to -25 (right). But then when moving left, the entire car moves left.\n\nActually, the representation: the head is the front of the car. For a left-moving car, the front is the leftmost? Or the rightmost? The problem says: for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at τ? And then the span is [h, τ] -> but if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be at the right? This is confusing.\n\nLooking at the update: \n  Left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  So the entire interval shifts left by s*(T-t1).\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)] -> shifts right.\n\nIn the example for freeway1: at T=7, the car is from -60 to -25. Then at T=8, it moves left by 36: becomes [-60-36, -25-36] = [-96, -61]. Then at T=9: [-132,-97], etc. So 0 is never in this car's span? Because the entire car is negative and moving left.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: same as freeway1: same car? So also negative and moving left.\n\nNow freeway3: three cars, all right-moving, speed 12.\n  Car1: (36,25,right,12) -> at T=7: [25, 36] -> then at T: [25+12*(T-7), 36+12*(T-7)]\n  Car2: (-48,-59,right,12) -> wait, the input is (-48,-59,right,12). But for right-moving, the head is the first number? Then head=-48, tail=-59? Then the span at T=7 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]. Then at T: [-59+12*(T-7), -48+12*(T-7)]\n  Car3: (-12,-23,right,12) -> span at T=7: [-23,-12]\n\nWe are interested in when 0 is in any of these spans.\n\nFor car1: 25+12*(T-7) <= 0 <= 36+12*(T-7) -> \n  25+12*(T-7) <= 0 -> 12*(T-7) <= -25 -> T-7 <= -25/12 = -2.08 -> impossible? So never covers 0.\n\nFor car2: [-59+12*(T-7), -48+12*(T-7)] \n  Condition: -59+12*(T-7) <= 0 <= -48+12*(T-7)\n  Left: -59+12*(T-7) <= 0 -> 12*(T-7) <= 59 -> T-7 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916 -> T<=7+4.916=11.916 -> so T=8,9,10,11\n  Right: 0 <= -48+12*(T-7) -> 12*(T-7) >= 48 -> T-7>=4 -> T>=11.\n  So both conditions: T-7>=4 and T-7<=4.916 -> T-7=4 -> T=11? \n  Check: at T=11: \n      T_rel=4 -> [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? [A,B] with A<=0<=B? -11<=0<=0 -> yes, 0 is included.\n\n  At T=10: T_rel=3 -> [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12]? no.\n  At T=11: [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n  At T=12: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  Actually, at T=11: the right end is 0? So 0 is included.\n\n  But wait: the condition is A<=0<=B. At T=11: A=-11, B=0 -> so 0 is included? Yes.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the span is [τ+s*(T-7), h+s*(T-7)] and for this car, τ=-59, h=-48? Then at T=11: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0]. So 0 is included.\n\n  But also at T=11, the car3: (-12,-23,right,12): \n      span at T=7: [-23,-12]\n      at T: [-23+12*(T-7), -12+12*(T-7)]\n      at T=11: T_rel=4 -> [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So freeway3 at T=11: car2 has 0 in its span.\n\n  But note: freeway3 has three cars. We only need one car to have 0 to cause a collision.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway4: same as freeway3? Because the cars are identical? So same: at T=11, freeway4 also has a car that covers 0.\n\nFreeway5: two cars, both right-moving, speed 12.\n  Car1: (12,1,right,12) -> at T=7: [1,12] -> then [1+12*(T-7), 12+12*(T-7)]\n      Condition: 1+12*(T-7) <= 0 <= 12+12*(T-7) -> \n        Left: 1+12*(T-7) <=0 -> T-7 <= -1/12 -> impossible.\n  Car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> at T=7: [-47,-36] -> then [-47+12*(T-7), -36+12*(T-7)]\n      Condition: -47+12*(T-7) <=0<=-36+12*(T-7)\n        Left: -47+12*(T-7)<=0 -> 12*(T-7)<=47 -> T-7<=47/12≈3.916 -> T<=10.916 -> T=8,9,10\n        Right: 0<=-36+12*(T-7) -> 12*(T-7)>=36 -> T-7>=3 -> T>=10.\n        So T-7=3 -> T=10.\n        At T=10: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\nSo freeway5 at T=10: collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same as freeway5 -> collision at T=10.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway5 -> collision at T=10.\n\nFreeway8: two cars, both right-moving, but speed 4.\n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,4) -> at T=7: [-47,-36] -> then [-47+4*(T-7), -36+4*(T-7)]\n      Condition: -47+4*(T-7)<=0<=-36+4*(T-7)\n        Left: -47+4*(T-7)<=0 -> 4*(T-7)<=47 -> T-7<=11.75 -> T<=18.75 -> T=8 to 18.\n        Right: 0<=-36+4*(T-7) -> 4*(T-7)>=36 -> T-7>=9 -> T>=16.\n        So T-7 in [9,11.75] -> T=16,17,18? \n        At T=16: T_rel=9 -> [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n        At T=17: [-47+40, -36+40] = [-7,4] -> includes 0? 0 is in [-7,4]? yes.\n        Actually, at T=16: [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n        T=17: [-7,4] -> includes 0.\n        T=18: [-47+4*11, -36+44] -> T_rel=11: [-47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8] -> includes 0.\n        T=19: T_rel=12: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> does not include 0.\n\n        So freeway8 has collisions at T=16,17,18.\n\n  Car2: (28,17,right,4) -> at T=7: [17,28] -> then [17+4*(T-7), 28+4*(T-7)]\n      Condition: 17+4*(T-7)<=0<=28+4*(T-7) -> \n        Left: 17+4*(T-7)<=0 -> 4*(T-7)<=-17 -> impossible.\n\nSo freeway8: collisions at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow, we can summarize the dangerous (turn, freeway) pairs:\n\nFreeway1: no collision at any T (since the car is always negative and moving left)\nFreeway2: same as freeway1 -> safe.\nFreeway3: collision at T=11.\nFreeway4: same as freeway3 -> collision at T=11.\nFreeway5: collision at T=10.\nFreeway6: same as freeway5 -> collision at T=10.\nFreeway7: same as freeway5 -> collision at T=10.\nFreeway8: collisions at T=16,17,18.\n\nAdditionally, we must check for other cars on the same freeway at other turns? For example, freeway3 has three cars. We already saw that car2 causes collision at T=11. But what about other cars at other turns? For freeway3, car1 and car3 never cover 0? So only T=11 is dangerous for freeway3 and freeway4.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway5,6,7: only T=10 is dangerous? But wait, freeway5: car2 only at T=10? Yes. And freeway8: only T=16,17,18.\n\nBut note: there might be multiple cars on the same freeway at the same turn? But we only care if at least one car causes 0 to be covered.\n\nSo the dangerous situations:\n\n- At turn 10: freeways 5,6,7 are dangerous (if we are on any of these freeways at turn 10, we crash).\n- At turn 11: freeways 3,4 are dangerous.\n- At turns 16,17,18: freeway8 is dangerous.\n\nWe start at turn 7 at y=5.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal steps without obstacles: 4 steps (from 5->6->7->8->9). But we have obstacles at turn 10 and 11. Since we are starting at turn 7, we can compute the turn when we would be at each freeway.\n\nBut note: we can control the timing by waiting (S) or even moving down (D) to avoid being at a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate:\n\nOption 1: Go straight up without stopping:\n  Turn 7: at y=5 -> freeway5: we are at freeway5 at turn7. Is freeway5 dangerous at turn7? We computed only at turn10. So at turn7: freeway5: we must check the cars at turn7.\n\nWe must check every freeway we step on at the turn we are there.\n\nFor freeway5 at turn7: \n  Car1: (12,1,right,12) -> span at T=7: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? \n  Car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> span at T=7: [-47,-36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36].\n  So safe.\n\nThen we take U: at turn8, we are at y=6 (freeway6).\n\nFreeway6 at turn8: same cars as freeway5? But freeway6 has the same car descriptions? \n  Car1: (12,1,right,12) -> at T=8: [1+12*1, 12+12*1] = [13,24] -> no 0.\n  Car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> no 0. Safe.\n\nThen U: turn9, y=7 (freeway7).\n  Freeway7 at turn9: \n      Car1: [1+12*2, 12+12*2] = [25,36] -> no 0.\n      Car2: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> no 0. Safe.\n\nThen U: turn10, y=8 (freeway8).\n  But wait: we are at freeway8 at turn10? \n      Freeway8: \n        Car1: (-36,-47,right,4) -> at T=10: T_rel=3 -> [-47+4*3, -36+4*3] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> no 0.\n        Car2: (28,17,right,4) -> at T=10: [17+4*3, 28+4*3] = [17+12,28+12]=[29,40] -> no 0.\n      So safe? \n\nBut wait: we were going from y=7 at turn9 to y=8 at turn10. Then at turn10, we are at freeway8. And we computed freeway8 is only dangerous at T=16,17,18? So at T=10, freeway8 is safe.\n\nThen we can take U: turn11, y=9 -> goal. And at turn11, we are at y=9 (safe) so we don't need to check.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn7: U -> from y5 to y6 (at turn8)\n  Turn8: U -> from y6 to y7 (at turn9)\n  Turn9: U -> from y7 to y8 (at turn10)\n  Turn10: U -> from y8 to y9 (at turn11)\n\nThen at the start of turn11, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut we must check: at turn10 we are at freeway8? and freeway8 at turn10 is safe? Yes, as above.\n\nBut what about the dangerous freeways at turn10? freeways5,6,7 are dangerous at turn10? But we are at freeway8 at turn10, so we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn11, we are at freeway9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: at turn7, we started at freeway5 -> safe? We computed: freeway5 at turn7: safe.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n\nTotal H=4 actions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that at turn10, freeway5,6,7 are dangerous? But we are at freeway8 at turn10, so we avoid.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at turn10: we are not there? We were at freeway5 at turn7, then at turn8 we were at freeway6, turn9 at freeway7, and turn10 at freeway8. So we are not on freeway5,6,7 at turn10? Correct.\n\nBut is there any other car that we haven't considered? For instance, freeway8 at turn10: we computed the two cars: \n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,4) at T=10: T_rel=3 -> [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> no 0.\n  Car2: (28,17,right,4) -> [17+12,28+12] = [29,40] -> no 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, we can go straight up in 4 moves.\n\nBut why were freeway5,6,7 dangerous at turn10? That is if we were on freeway5 at turn10, we would crash. But we are not.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We start at y=5 at turn7. We need to get to y=9. The minimal moves is 4. So 4 is the minimal possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of H actions. H is the number of actions? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", but then the sequence is from t=0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions? And the total turns taken is H, and we end at turn 7+H.\n\nIn this case, H=4.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", but note that we are at turn7 and we take 4 actions (at turn7,8,9,10) and then at turn11 we are at y=9. So we took 4 turns (actions) and reached at turn11.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n  t1=7, H=4 -> t1+H-1 = 7+4-1=10? But we are at y=9 at the start of turn11? \n\nWait, there is confusion.\n\nLet me reexamine the timing:\n\n- At the start of turn7: we are at (0,5). \n- We take action a_7 (at turn7) and then at the start of turn8, we are at y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nSo after the action at turn7, we are at the start of turn8 at y_8.\n\nSimilarly, after the last action at turn10, we are at the start of turn11 at y_11.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the start of turn11? Then we have taken actions at turn7,8,9,10 -> 4 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n  t1+H-1 = 7+4-1 = 10 -> the start of turn10? \n\nBut at the start of turn10, we are at y10, which is 8 (if we took three U's: at turn7,8,9). Then at turn10 we take the last U and then at the start of turn11 we are at 9.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the start of turn11, which is turn t1+4 = 11.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). So if we set H=4, then t1+H-1=7+4-1=10, but we are at 9 at turn11, not turn10.\n\nThis indicates a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo at the end of the sequence (after the last action) we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut in our simulation, after the last action (at turn10) we are at (0,9) at the start of turn11? That is turn11.\n\nBut the problem says the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1? Then the state after that action is at the start of the next turn? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the turn when the action is taken is the same turn when we are at the state? \n\nBut the update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t -> so the action at turn t updates the state for turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the state at the start of turn t is y_t. Then we take an action at turn t, which then sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the start of turn T, we must have taken the last action at turn T-1.\n\nTherefore, the turn when we are at (0,9) is T = t1+H? Because:\n  We start at turn t1: state (t1, y0)\n  Then we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n  Then the state at turn t1+H is the result.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nThis suggests that after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at the same turn? \n\nBut the update rule: the action at turn t updates the state for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, the turn count in the problem includes the starting turn? But they say \"current turn is t1\", and we start at (0,y_t1) at turn t1.\n\nThen we take an action at turn t1, which leads to the state at turn t1+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me assume the problem means that we are to be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H, after taking H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1). \n\nBut then the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which is the turn of the last action.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turn\" when we are at (0,9) is the same as the last action turn? \n\nBut the collision condition: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. And we are at y_T at the start of turn T, and then we take an action to move to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo to avoid collision, we must not be on a freeway 1-8 at the start of turn T if there is a car covering 0 on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, if we are at (0,9) at the start of turn T, then we are safe because 9 is not a freeway with cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThat means we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: that is H actions.\n\nThis does not match.\n\nPerhaps the actions are taken and then immediately the state is updated? But the problem does not specify.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me read the problem again: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and the turn when we are at (0,9) is t1+H-1.\n\nThis implies that after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at that same turn? \n\nBut the update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t. \n  => This suggests that the action at turn t affects the state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken the action at turn t1+H-2, so that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThen the sequence of actions should be from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nUnless the first action is taken at turn t1, and then after the action we are at turn t1+1 with a new y. Then we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the number of actions is H-1? But the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, which would be H actions.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we take an action at turn t1+t for t=0 to H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we have taken the last action and the state is updated to (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the update rule explicitly says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo the action at turn t determines y_{t+1}, not y_t.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is determined by the actions at turns before t.\n\nTo resolve, I will assume that the problem means we are to be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H, after taking H actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-1). This is the common interpretation.\n\nThen the turn when we are at (0,9) is t1+H.\n\nAnd the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\nIn our case, we reach at turn11 = 7+4, so H=4.\n\nAnd the answer format should be:\n\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which would be 7+4-1=10. But we are at 9 at turn11, not turn10.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to be at (0,9) at turn10, then we would need to be there at the start of turn10.\n\nBut with actions at turn7,8,9 (3 actions), we would be at y8 at the start of turn10. To be at y9 at the start of turn10, we would have to have taken the action at turn9 to go from y8 to y9? But that would require being at y8 at turn9. \n\nBut at the start of turn9, if we have taken two actions (U at turn7 and U at turn8), we are at y7. Then at turn9 we take U to go to y8 at turn10. Not y9.\n\nTo be at y9 at the start of turn10, we would have to be at y8 at the start of turn9, and then take U at turn9 to have y9 at turn10.\n\nBut to be at y8 at the start of turn9, we would have to take three actions in two turns? That's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at y9 is at turn11.\n\nI think the problem has a typo. It should be \"at turn t1+H\".\n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnother possibility: the turns are counted such that the current turn is t1, and we are about to take actions. The first action is taken at turn t1, and then the state for turn t1 is updated immediately? But the update rule says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, which suggests the state at turn t is not changed by the action at turn t.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will output the sequence that gets us to y9 at turn11 with 4 actions, and assume that the problem meant turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", so they want turn10.\n\nHow can we be at y9 at turn10? We start at turn7 at y5.\n\nWe need to move up 4 steps. Each step takes one turn (action). So we need 4 actions, which would get us to y9 at turn11.\n\nUnless we can move faster? But the actions are only U, D, S: we can only move one step per turn.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y9 at turn10.\n\nThen what? \n\nPerhaps the problem means that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then immediately after that action we are at (0,9) at the same turn? But the update rule contradicts.\n\nGiven the above, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. We should aim to be at (0,9) at turn11.\n\nAnd the minimal H is 4.\n\nAnd the answer is the sequence for turns 7 to 10.\n\nTo be safe, let's check if there is a way to be at y9 at turn10? It would require 3 actions: from turn7 to turn9 (3 actions) to go from 5 to 8? Then at turn9, if we take U, we are at y9 at turn10. But then the last action is at turn9, so H=3 actions: turn7,8,9.\n\nBut then we are at y9 at turn10, which is t1+H-1 = 7+3-1=9? No, turn10 is 7+3=10, not 9.\n\nLet me compute the turns:\n\n- Start: turn7, y5.\n- Action at turn7: U -> at turn8, y6.\n- Action at turn8: U -> at turn9, y7.\n- Action at turn9: U -> at turn10, y8.\n\nTo be at y9 at turn10, we would have to have taken an action at turn9 that moves us to y9 at turn10, but that requires being at y8 at turn9. But at turn9, we are at y7 (from the action at turn8). So we cannot.\n\nIf we could move faster, but we can't.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem likely meant that we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nAnd the sequence has H actions.\n\nSo I will output the 4 actions.\n\nBut to match the problem's \"t1+H-1\", if we set H=5, then t1+H-1=7+5-1=11, and we would be at y9 at turn11.\n\nThen the sequence would be the actions from turn7 to turn10 (4 actions) and then one more action? But we are already at y9 at turn11, so we don't need to take an action at turn10? We only need 4 actions.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAnother interpretation: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then the state at the turn when the last action is taken (turn t1+H-1) is the state after that action? But the update rule says the action at turn t updates y_{t+1}.\n\nUnless the problem means that the action at turn t updates the state immediately at turn t? Then we would be at the new y at turn t after the action.\n\nThen collision at turn t would be with the new y.\n\nBut the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which implies that at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nSo the state at the start of turn T is y_T, and you are on freeway y_T during turn T.\n\nThen you take an action, which will move you to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, the state does not change during the turn.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, you must be at y=9 at the start of turn T.\n\nAnd you get there by actions taken at turns before T.\n\nSo for turn T=10, you must have been at y8 at turn9, and taken U at turn9 to be at y9 at turn10.\n\nSo to be at y9 at turn10, you need actions at turn7,8,9.\n\nBut at turn7: start at y5. \n  Action U at turn7 -> at turn8, y6.\n  Action U at turn8 -> at turn9, y7.\n  Action U at turn9 -> at turn10, y8, not y9.\n\nTo be at y9 at turn10, you would need to be at y8 at turn9. But with three actions, you can only get to y8 at turn10, not at turn9.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y9 at turn10.\n\nSimilarly, the earliest is turn11.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem has a typo and meant turn t1+H.\n\nI will output for H=4.\n\nBut let me see if there is a sequence that avoids the obstacles and takes 4 actions, as described.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Turn7: at y5 -> freeway5: safe.\n- Turn8: at y6 -> freeway6: safe.\n- Turn9: at y7 -> freeway7: safe.\n- Turn10: at y8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\nThen at turn11, at y9: safe.\n\nSo the sequence is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut to match the problem's \"t1+H-1\", if they expect turn10 to be the arrival turn, then we would need to output for H=5 and include an extra action? But then we would be at y9 at turn11, which is t1+5-1=11? Then that matches.\n\nBut with H=5, we would take 5 actions, and be at turn7+5=12 at the next state? But we want to be at y9 at turn11.\n\nAlternatively, if we set H=5, then we are to be at (0,9) at turn7+5-1=11.\n\nThen the actions are from turn7 to turn7+4 (turn11? no, turn7 to turn7+4 is turn7,8,9,10,11?).\n\nBut we only need 4 actions to be at y9 at turn11.\n\nPerhaps we can add a dummy stay at the end? But then we would be at y9 at turn12.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nGiven the above, I think the problem likely has a typo and we should be at turn t1+H.\n\nSo I'll go with the 4 actions.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there is a shorter path? There isn't because we need 4 moves up.\n\nOr if we can avoid the obstacles in exactly 4 actions, which we can.\n\nSo the answer is the four U's.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 7 in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The minimal number of actions required is 4, as the player must move up four times to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to reach y=6 at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to reach y=7 at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to reach y=8 at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nCollision checks for each turn:\n- **Turn 7 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 has cars at turn 7:  \n  - Car 1: [1, 12] (0 not in span)  \n  - Car 2: [-47, -36] (0 not in span)  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 8 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 has cars at turn 8:  \n  - Car 1: [13, 24] (0 not in span)  \n  - Car 2: [-35, -24] (0 not in span)  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 9 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 has cars at turn 9:  \n  - Car 1: [25, 36] (0 not in span)  \n  - Car 2: [-23, -12] (0 not in span)  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 10 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 has cars at turn 10:  \n  - Car 1: [-35, -24] (0 not in span)  \n  - Car 2: [29, 40] (0 not in span)  \n  Safe.\n\nAt turn 11, the player is at y=9, which is safe as there are no cars on freeway 9. The sequence achieves the goal in 4 actions, and no shorter sequence is possible due to the distance and movement constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 6) at turn t_1 = 8. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The span is the position of the car on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, we care about whether 0 is covered by the car at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide an action to go to y_{T+1}. You are only considered on y_T at turn T, so if you move to a new row, you don't check for collision on the new row until the next turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1 = 8.\n\nFor freeway k=1: one car with head 48, tail 83, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, the span is [h, τ] but head and tail: it says (48, 83, left, 36). If direction is left, and head is 48, tail 83, that might be inconsistent because for left-moving cars, head is usually the front, so if moving left, head should be larger than tail? Let me read the car update.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t) = [h, τ] and at T>t, span(T) = [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nIn this case, for k=1: head h=48, tail τ=83? But 48 to 83, if it's left-moving, moving left would decrease positions, but 48 to 83, that's increasing, which might be wrong.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut if h and τ are positions, for a left-moving car, h should be the leftmost or rightmost? Typically, head is the front.\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says [τ, h] for span at t1, but let's parse.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn k=1, it says (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83, direction left.\n\nBut if left-moving, and span [h, τ] = [48,83], which is from 48 to 83, that's increasing, but left-moving should have decreasing positions? I think there might be confusion in head and tail definition.\n\nPerhaps for left-moving, h is the head position at t1, which is the right end if moving left? Let's think.\n\nA car moving left has its front at a higher x-value, decreasing over time.\n\nFor example, if at t1, front is at x, back at x-L for some length.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and h - s dt, τ - s dt, so if it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nBut in [h, τ], if h and τ are coordinates, and span is [min, max] or what?\n\nThe collision condition is 0 in Span(T), so Span must be an interval.\n\nFor left-moving, if [h, τ] at t1, and h and τ are numbers, but in k=1, h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], which means the car occupies from 48 to 83 at t1.\n\nBut 48 to 83, if moving left, at later time, it shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] for some reason.\n\nIn k=3, there is (48,37, right,12), and span [τ,h] = [37,48] I assume, since τ=37, h=48.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nFor right-moving car: Span(t1) = [τ, h], so in this case, for (48,37,right,12), τ=37, h=48, so [τ,h] = [37,48], which is from 37 to 48, and moving right, so at T, [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [37 + s dt, 48 + s dt].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, (48,83,left,36), h=48, τ=83, so [h,τ] = [48,83], and moving left, at T, [48 - s dt, 83 - s dt].\n\nBut [48,83] at t1, and moving left, so positions decrease.\n\nNow, the player is at x=0, so we care when the car span includes 0.\n\nAlso, the freeways are y=1 to 8, and player on y=k at turn T must not have 0 in any car span on that freeway at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, but for collision, we need to avoid if for any car on that row at that turn, 0 is in its span.\n\nNow, the current turn is t1=8, player at (0,6).\n\nWe need to go to (0,9), so y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there, so once we reach y=9, we are safe, and since we are at x=0 always, we just need to be at y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so no cars, so collision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and we can be there at some turn, and since no cars, it's fine.\n\nNow, minimal turns to go from y=6 to y=9, the shortest path would be to go up three times, but we have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at turn t=8.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y for the next position.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t=8.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nFor collision check at turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_T with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe span depends on the time from t1=8.\n\nLet dt = T - t1 = T - 8.\n\nFor each freeway, we have the car configurations.\n\nFirst, list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36)\n\nSpan at time T: since left-moving, [h - s(T-8), τ - s(T-8)] = [48 - 36(T-8), 83 - 36(T-8)]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36 dt ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36 dt, where dt = T-8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (48,83,left,36), identical to freeway 1. Probably a copy, but we have to consider separately.\n\nFreeway 2: (48,83,left,36), same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h]\n\nFor (48,37,right,12): τ=37, h=48, so [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T, [37 + 12(dt), 48 + 12(dt)]\n\nSimilarly, (-36,-47,right,12): τ=-47, h=-36, so [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt T, [-47 + 12(dt), -36 + 12(dt)]\n\nAnd (0,-11,right,12): τ=-11, h=0, so [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T, [-11 + 12(dt), 0 + 12(dt)] = [-11 +12dt, 12dt]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\n(24,13,right,12): τ=13, h=24, so [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 +12dt, 24+12dt]\n\n(-24,-35,right,12): τ=-35, h=-24, [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35+12dt, -24+12dt]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5: (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-32,-43,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4), τ=-43, h=-32, [τ,h] = [-43,-32]\n\nAt T: [-43 +4dt, -32 +4dt]\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4), τ=21, h=32, [τ,h] = [21,32]\n\nAt T: [21 +4dt, 32 +4dt]\n\nNow, player starts at y=6 at T=8 (t1=8).\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to increase y by 3, so at least 3 turns if we go up each time.\n\nBut we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nSince we start at y=6, and need to go to y=9, we should only consider moving up or staying, moving down would take us away, so probably not useful, unless to avoid something.\n\nBut let's see the cars on freeway 6, since player is on y=6 at T=8.\n\nFirst, at turn T=8, player is on y=6, which is a freeway, so we need to check if there is collision at T=8.\n\nFor freeway 6, at T=8, dt=0.\n\nCars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt dt=0, spans: [13,24] and [-35,-24]\n\n0 is not in [13,24] nor in [-35,-24], so no collision at T=8 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but since player is on y=6, we only care about y=6 at that turn.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=7,8,9 or something.\n\nActions: at turn T, we choose action for y_{T+1}.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, we choose action a_T to determine y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we check based on y_T and the cars on that row at time T.\n\nPlayer at T=8: y=6, no collision as above.\n\nNow, we choose action a_8: U, D, or S.\n\nIf a_8 = U, then y_9 = 7\n\nIf a_8 = S, y_9 = 6\n\nIf a_8 = D, y_9 = 5\n\nBut we want to go to 9, so D is not good, probably.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T=9, we choose a_9, and so on.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, with H turns, so at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nSince we start at t1=8, position at t1 is given, we choose actions for t=8,9,10,... up to some T where y_T=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from t=8 to t=8+H-1, y at t=8+H-1 is 9.\n\nInitial position at t=8, after H actions, at time t=8+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe time at position y_t is at turn t.\n\nNow, to go from y=6 to y=9, min H=3 if we go up each time.\n\nSo possible sequence: a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, then at t=10, y=9.\n\nt=8: y=6\n\na8=U: y9=7\n\na9=U: y10=8\n\na10=U: y11=9\n\nAt t=11, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions during the path, at t=8,9,10.\n\nt=8: y=6, we already checked, no collision at t=8.\n\nt=9: y=7, since we moved to y=7 at t=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=8, we are at y=6, we choose a8, which sets y for t=9.\n\nAt turn t=9, we are at y_9, which depends on a8.\n\nThen at turn t=9, we are on y=9, and we check collision for that row at time t=9.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nIn this case, if a8=U, then at t=9, y=7.\n\nAt t=9, y=7, which is freeway 7.\n\nCheck cars on freeway 7 at time t=9.\n\nt=9, dt = t - t1 = 9 - 8 =1\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: same as freeway 5, (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt time T=9, dt=1\n\nSpan for first car: [13 +12*1, 24+12*1] = [25,36]\n\nSecond car: [-35 +12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12]\n\n0 not in [25,36] nor in [-23,-12], so no collision at t=9 on y=7.\n\nThen a9=U, so y10=8\n\nAt t=10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCheck freeway 8 at time t=10.\n\ndt = t-8 =2\n\nFreeway 8 cars: (-32,-43,right,4) and (32,21,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4), span at T: [-43 +4dt, -32 +4dt] at dt=2: [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35,-24]\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4), [21 +4dt, 32 +4dt] at dt=2: [21+8, 32+8] = [29,40]\n\n0 not in [-35,-24] nor [29,40], so no collision.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=9, at t=11, y=9, no freeway, done.\n\nH=3 turns: actions at t=8,9,10.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=8, H=3, so actions at t=8,9,10.\n\na8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nBut is this safe? We need to check if at any point there is collision.\n\nAt t=8: y=6, ok\n\nt=9: y=7, ok\n\nt=10: y=8, ok\n\nt=11: y=9, done.\n\nBut y=8 at t=10 is freeway 8, and we checked no collision.\n\nThe problem is to reach (0,9), so at t=11, y=9.\n\nH=3 seems possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nAt t=10, dt=2, cars: [-35,-24] and [29,40], 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut there might be cars that could cause issues at other times.\n\nIn this path, we only passed y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, y=8 at t=10.\n\ny=6 at t=8: freeway 6, spans [13,24] and [-35,-24] at dt=0, 0 not in.\n\ny=7 at t=9: freeway 7, spans [13+12=25,24+12=36] and [-35+12=-23,-24+12=-12], 0 not in.\n\ny=8 at t=10: freeway 8, spans [-43+8=-35,-32+8=-24] and [21+8=29,32+8=40], 0 not in.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player position: at t=8, y=6; t=9, y=7; t=10, y=8; t=11, y=9.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? H=3 should be minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we need to consider other paths.\n\nPerhaps on other rows there are dangerous times.\n\nFor example, if we stayed or moved down, but that would take longer.\n\nMaybe we can go directly, but H=3 seems fine.\n\nBut let's check if at t=10 on y=8, is there any car that covers 0 soon? But at that exact time, no.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 3 has a car at (0,-11,right,12) at t1, but that's on freeway 3, which we don't visit in this path.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nIn the sequence above, we didn't go to y=3 or anything.\n\nSo seems safe.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 3 and 4, there is a car (0,-11,right,12) at t1.\n\nAt t1=8, dt=0, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? Let's see.\n\nFor freeway 3: car (0,-11,right,12), at t1, [τ,h] = [-11,0], so at dt=0, span [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nSo at t=8, on freeway 3, there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nBut in our path, at t=8, we are on y=6, not y=3, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, if we were on y=3 at t=8, we would collide, but we are not.\n\nSo for our path, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nSo with three up actions, we can reach in H=3.\n\nBut let's see if we can do in fewer? From y=6 to y=9, we need at least three steps, since each action changes y by at most 1. So H=3 is minimum possible.\n\nUnless we start at y=9, but we are at y=6.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nBut perhaps at some point we have to avoid, but in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let's double-check the car on freeway 8 at t=10.\n\ndt=2, first car: [-43 +4*2 = -43+8= -35, -32+8= -24], so [-35,-24]\n\nSecond car: [21+8=29, 32+8=40], [29,40]\n\n0 not in, yes.\n\nBut what about at other times? For example, if we were on y=8 at different time.\n\nBut in this path, we are only there at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 at t=9, etc.\n\nPerhaps we should consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nBut there is a car on freeway 3 at t=8 with 0 in span, but we are not there.\n\nAnother thing: the player might be on other rows if we move differently.\n\nBut since we go directly up, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4, same as 3.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSo I think H=3 is possible with actions U,U,U at t=8,9,10.\n\nBut the sequence should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo output:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (for turn 8)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U (turn 9)\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1+2} = U (turn 10)\n\nThen at turn t_1 + 2 +1 = t_1 +3, position is (0,9), but the actions are up to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=3, so actions at t_1 to t_1+2.\n\nAfter last action at t_1+2, position at next turn is y=9.\n\nIn terms of time: after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nSo with actions at t=8,9,10, positions: after a8, at t=9, y=7; after a9, at t=10, y=8; after a10, at t=11, y=9.\n\nAt t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nAnd we didn't collide at t=8,9,10.\n\nt=8: y=6, no collision; t=9: y=7, no; t=10: y=8, no.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8 at t=10.\n\ndt=2, cars: [-35,-24] and [29,40], yes.\n\nBut is there a car that covers 0 at some time?\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, when does a car cover 0?\n\nFirst car: [-43 +4dt, -32 +4dt], set equal to 0.\n\n-43 +4dt <= 0 <= -32 +4dt? Since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFirst car: low = -43 +4dt, high = -32 +4dt\n\nSet low <= 0 <= high: -43 +4dt <= 0 and 0 <= -32 +4dt\n\nSo -43 +4dt <=0 => 4dt <=43 => dt <= 43/4=10.75\n\nAnd 0 <= -32 +4dt => 4dt >=32 => dt >=8\n\nSimilarly, second car: low=21+4dt, high=32+4dt\n\n21+4dt <=0 <=32+4dt\n\n21+4dt <=0 => 4dt <= -21, impossible since dt>=0\n\n0 <=32+4dt always true for dt>=0\n\nBut 21+4dt <=0 requires dt <= -21/4, impossible, so second car never covers 0.\n\nFirst car covers 0 when dt >=8 and dt <=10.75, so for integer dt, dt=8,9,10.\n\ndt=8: low= -43+32= -11, high= -32+32=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=9: low= -43+36= -7, high= -32+36=4, [-7,4], 0 included.\n\ndt=10: low= -43+40= -3, high= -32+40=8, [-3,8], 0 included.\n\ndt=11: low= -43+44=1, high= -32+44=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, dt=7: low= -43+28= -15, high= -32+28= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not included.\n\nSo on freeway 8, collision if player is on y=8 at dt=8,9,10, i.e., T=16,17,18? t1=8, T=t1 + dt.\n\nt1=8, so T=8+dt.\n\nCollision on freeway 8 when T=16,17,18? dt=8, T=8+8=16; dt=9, T=17; dt=10, T=18.\n\nIn our case, at t=10, which is T=10, dt=2, not 8,9,10, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: car (0,-11,right,12), at dt, span [-11+12dt, 12dt]\n\n0 in span if -11+12dt <=0 <=12dt\n\nFirst, 0 <=12dt always for dt>=0\n\n-11+12dt <=0 => 12dt <=11 => dt <=11/12 <1, so only at dt=0, since dt integer, dt=0, T=8.\n\nAt T=8, on freeway 3, collision possible.\n\nBut we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nSo with three up actions, we reach in H=3.\n\nBut the player starts at y=6, which is freeway 6.\n\nAt t=8, on y=6, we have cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt dt=0, [13,24] and [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nBut when does freeway 6 have collision?\n\nFirst car: [13+12dt, 24+12dt], 0 in? 13+12dt <=0 <=24+12dt? 13+12dt <=0 => dt <= -13/12, impossible, so never.\n\nSecond car: [-35+12dt, -24+12dt], 0 in if -35+12dt <=0 <= -24+12dt\n\n0 <= -24+12dt => 12dt >=24 => dt >=2\n\n-35+12dt <=0 => 12dt <=35 => dt <=35/12=2.916, so dt=2 or 3? dt integer.\n\ndt=2: low= -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=3: low= -35+36=1, high= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not included? 1>0, so no.\n\nAt dt=2, high= -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included since it's closed interval, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, dt=2: -35+12*2= -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is the endpoint, included.\n\nSo at T=10 (t1=8, dt=2), on freeway 6, second car covers 0.\n\nBut in our path, at t=10, we are on y=8, not y=6.\n\nIf we were on y=6 at t=10, we would collide, but we are not.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=6 only at t=8, dt=0, no issue.\n\nAt t=9, y=7; t=10, y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider that at some point we might be forced to stay, but not here.\n\nAnother thing: the player cannot go beyond y=0 or y=9, but here we are moving up from 6 to 9, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 4, same as 3, with car at (0,-11,right,12) at t1, so at t=8, on y=4, collision if present.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSo for the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut the output format should be in a box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nSo for H=3, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be written as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\end{array} } \n\nSince t_1 is given, we can use the numbers.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., but since t_1=8, we can write the numbers.\n\nTo be general, but I think with numbers is fine.\n\nPerhaps write as \"Turn t_1: U\" but since t_1 specified, use numbers.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nNow, but wait a second, is there any issue with the cars on the way?\n\nFor example, at t=9, we are on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nCars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=9, dt=1, spans [13+12=25,24+12=36] and [-35+12=-23,-24+12=-12], no 0.\n\nBut when does freeway 7 have collision?\n\nFirst car: [13+12dt,24+12dt], never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: [-35+12dt, -24+12dt], covers 0 when -35+12dt <=0 <= -24+12dt\n\n0 <= -24+12dt => dt >= 24/12=2\n\n-35+12dt <=0 => dt <= 35/12≈2.916, so dt=2 or 3? dt=2: low=-35+24=-11, high=-24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=3: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSo at dt=2, T=10, on freeway 7, collision possible if present.\n\nAt t=10, in our path, we are on y=8, not y=7.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, if we stayed on y=7 at t=10, we would collide, but we move up.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is three up actions.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns required to increase the y-coordinate from 6 to 9 is 3, as each \"U\" action increases y by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve this. The sequence of actions must be checked for collisions at each turn when the player is on a freeway (y between 1 and 8).\n\n- At turn 8, the player is at y = 6 (freeway 6).  \n  - Cars on freeway 6 at turn 8 (dt = 0):  \n    - (24, 13, right, 12): span [13, 24] → 0 not in span.  \n    - (-24, -35, right, 12): span [-35, -24] → 0 not in span.  \n  - No collision. Action \\(a_8 = U\\) moves to y = 7 at turn 9.\n\n- At turn 9, the player is at y = 7 (freeway 7).  \n  - Cars on freeway 7 at turn 9 (dt = 1):  \n    - (24, 13, right, 12): span [13 + 12(1), 24 + 12(1)] = [25, 36] → 0 not in span.  \n    - (-24, -35, right, 12): span [-35 + 12(1), -24 + 12(1)] = [-23, -12] → 0 not in span.  \n  - No collision. Action \\(a_9 = U\\) moves to y = 8 at turn 10.\n\n- At turn 10, the player is at y = 8 (freeway 8).  \n  - Cars on freeway 8 at turn 10 (dt = 2):  \n    - (-32, -43, right, 4): span [-43 + 4(2), -32 + 4(2)] = [-35, -24] → 0 not in span.  \n    - (32, 21, right, 4): span [21 + 4(2), 32 + 4(2)] = [29, 40] → 0 not in span.  \n  - No collision. Action \\(a_{10} = U\\) moves to y = 9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, y = 9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed, and the goal (0, 9) is reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions over \\(H = 3\\) turns is \\(a_8 = U\\), \\(a_9 = U\\), \\(a_{10} = U\\). This is minimal, as \\(H = 3\\) is the fewest possible turns to increase y by 3.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\end{array} }",

The vertical axis is from y=0 to y=9, so I need to move up from y=7 to y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, increase y by 1), D (down, decrease y by 1), or S (stay, y unchanged). Since I need to go up, I should mostly use U, but I have to avoid the cars on the freeways when I'm on them.\n\nThe collision rule: collision occurs at turn T if I'm on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at turn T. The span is the position of the car's head and tail moving with speed.\n\nImportantly, when I move from y to y+1 or y-1 at turn T, I'm not considered on y+1 until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. So if I move, at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and I only check for cars on y_T at that turn. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check for cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=7, and I need to go to y=9, I have to pass through y=8. But y=7 and y=8 are freeways with cars.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=9.\n\nFreeway k is the y-level, I think. The table says \"Freeway k\" and k from 1 to 8, so k=1 is y=1, k=2 is y=2, ..., k=8 is y=8.\n\nAnd for each, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. Left-moving means decreasing position, right-moving means increasing position.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), and for left-moving, head is larger, I think, since it moves left, so position decreases. Similarly for right-moving, head is smaller or larger?\n\nLook at the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf [h, τ] and it moves left, so h and τ decrease, so if h > τ, then [h, τ] might be from high to low, but in set notation, [h, τ] could imply h to τ, but if h > τ, it might be decreasing.\n\nIn the left-moving example: (12,47,left,36) — but 12 and 47, 12 < 47, but it says left-moving, and span [h, τ] = [12,47], but for left-moving, it should move to lower positions, so at T, [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT], which decreases, so if [12,47] at t_1, at later T, positions decrease, so head is at smaller number? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are positions, and direction indicates how it moves.\n\nIn left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIf it's [h, τ], and it moves left, meaning to decreasing x, so for example, if h and τ are positions, and left move, both decrease.\n\nBut in the pair (head, tail), which one is front? I think head is the front of the car.\n\nFor a left-moving car, front is left, so if x decreases to the left, head should have smaller x? Let's see the values.\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) — 12 and 47, 12 < 47, so if x=0 is the point, 12 and 47 are positions, with 47 > 12, so if left-moving, it should be moving to decreasing x, so head is at lower x? I think I need to interpret the span.\n\nThe collision is if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nSo for a car, the span is the interval it occupies.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ], and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]? No, the notation says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\" for right-moving.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the example, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47? But 12 < 47, and it's moving left, so at T, positions decrease, so span becomes [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT], which for s>0, 12 - sΔT < 12, 47 - sΔT < 47, so the span shifts left.\n\nBut 12 and 47, with τ=47, h=12, so if h is head and τ is tail, for left-moving, head should be on the left, so smaller x, so h=12, τ=47, tail at 47, which is larger x, so the car is from x=12 to x=47, with head at 12, tail at 47, so when moving left, head moves to smaller x, tail to smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the example, freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49,60]? The notation says (head, tail, dir, speed), so for (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, but for right-moving, Span is [τ, h] = [49,60], and at T, [49 + sΔT, 60 + sΔT], so it moves to increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nIn general, for a car:\n\n- If direction left: span at t is [h - s(t-t_1), τ - s(t-t_1)] for t >= t_1\n\n- If direction right: span at t is [τ + s(t-t_1), h + s(t-t_1)] for t >= t_1\n\nAnd collision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 in its span at T.\n\nAlso, the player position: at turn T, y_T, and action determines y_{T+1}.\n\nI start at turn t_1=9, position y=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I need to go up.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 have cars, so I need to avoid being on those freeways when a car is at x=0.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no freeway, so no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\ny=0 might have something, but I start from y=7, going to y=9, so I don't go to y=0.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since I need to go from y=7 to y=9, the minimal without cars would be 2 turns: U, U, to y=8 then y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to wait or something.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, the cars and their spans over time.\n\nt_1 = 9 is the current turn.\n\nFor freeway y=7, which is freeway k=7? Freeway k from 1 to 8, k=1 y=1, k=2 y=2, ..., k=8 y=8.\n\nPlayer at y=7, so freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving cars, Span(t) = [τ + s(t-9), h + s(t-9)]\n\nFor (36,25,right,12): head=36, tail=25? Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [25,36] at t=9.\n\nAt time t, span = [25 + 12(t-9), 36 + 12(t-9)]\n\nSimilarly for (-12,-23,right,12): head=-12, tail=-23, so span at t=9: [τ, h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt time t, [ -23 + 12(t-9), -12 + 12(t-9) ]\n\nNow, for freeway 8, k=8: cars (-28,-39,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nFor (-28,-39,right,4): head=-28, tail=-39, span at t=9: [τ, h] = [-39,-28]\n\nAt t, [ -39 + 4(t-9), -28 + 4(t-9) ]\n\nFor (36,25,right,4): head=36, tail=25, span at t=9: [25,36], at t: [25 + 4(t-9), 36 + 4(t-9)]\n\nNow, I need to be on a freeway only when 0 is not in any car's span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=7 at t=9, I need to check if at t=9, on y=7, is there a collision?\n\nFor y=7 at t=9:\n\nCars: (36,25,right,12): span [25 +12(0), 36+12(0)] = [25,36] at t=9, 0 not in [25,36]\n\n(-12,-23,right,12): span [-23,-12] at t=9, 0 not in [-23,-12], since -23 to -12, all negative.\n\nSo at t=9, on y=7, no collision. Good.\n\nNow, I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, at turn 9, I move to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, I will be on y=8, and I need to check cars on y=8 at t=10.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=7 at turn 10.\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably U is better, but let's see y=8.\n\nFirst, let's find when 0 is in the span for each freeway, so I know when it's safe to be there.\n\nStart with freeway 7 (y=7).\n\nCars on y=7:\n\n1. (36,25,right,12): span at time t: [25 + 12(t-9), 36 + 12(t-9)]\n\n0 in span when 25 + 12(t-9) <= 0 <= 36 + 12(t-9)\n\nSince 25 to 36, both positive, so 0 <= 36 + 12(t-9) but since 25+12(t-9) >0 for t>=9, 0 not in [25+12(t-9), 36+12(t-9)] because min is 25+12(t-9) >0 for t>=9? t=9: 25>0, t=10:25+12=37>0, always positive, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-12,-23,right,12): span at t: [-23 +12(t-9), -12 +12(t-9)]\n\n0 in span when -23 +12(t-9) <= 0 <= -12 +12(t-9)\n\nSet u = t-9, so -23 +12u <= 0 <= -12 +12u\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +12u <=0 => 12u <=23 => u <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +12u => 12u >=12 => u >=1\n\nSo u >=1 and u <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so u=1 or u=1.916? u integer since t integer, t-9 integer.\n\nu= t-9, integer.\n\nu >=1 and u <=1.916, so u=1 only, since u=2: 12*2=24>23, -23+24=1>0, not <=0.\n\nCheck:\n\nu=1: -23 +12(1) = -23+12= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true\n\n-12 +12(1) =0, so 0 <=0 true, so at u=1, t=10, span is [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], so 0 in [ -11, 0], yes.\n\nu=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nu=0: t=9, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=10, for this car, 0 is in the span.\n\nBut there is another car on y=7: the first one never has 0, so only this car causes collision at t=10 on y=7.\n\nAt t=10, on y=7, the second car has span including 0.\n\nBut for freeway 7, at t=10, if I am on y=7, I collide.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nAt turn t=9, I am at y=7, no collision.\n\nI can choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, I move to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am on y=8, not on y=7.\n\nIf I choose S, I stay at y=7 at turn 10, but at t=10, on y=7, there is collision, so I cannot stay at y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose D, go down to y=6, but I need to go up, so probably not good.\n\nBut let's see options.\n\nFirst, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn, then go U.\n\nNow, let's look at freeway 8, y=8.\n\nCars: (-28,-39,right,4) and (36,25,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4): head=-28, tail=-39, so for right-moving, span at t: [τ + s(t-9), h + s(t-9)] = [-39 +4(t-9), -28 +4(t-9)]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4): [25 +4(t-9), 36 +4(t-9)]\n\nNow, find when 0 in span for y=8.\n\nFirst car: [-39 +4(t-9), -28 +4(t-9)]\n\n0 in span if -39 +4u <= 0 <= -28 +4u, where u=t-9\n\n-39 +4u <=0 => 4u <=39 => u <= 39/4 = 9.75\n\n0 <= -28 +4u => 4u >=28 => u >=7\n\nSo u >=7 and u <=9.75, so u=7,8,9\n\nCheck:\n\nu=7: -39 +4*7 = -39+28= -11, -28+28=0, so [-11,0], 0 in span.\n\nu=8: -39+32= -7, -28+32=4, span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nu=9: -39+36= -3, -28+36=8, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nu=10: -39+40=1, -28+40=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25 +4u, 36 +4u], all positive for u>=0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only first car matters, and 0 in span at u=7,8,9, i.e., t=16,17,18? u=t-9.\n\nt-9=7,8,9 so t=16,17,18.\n\nt=16,17,18.\n\nBut current t=9, so later.\n\nNow, at t=9, on y=8, what is the span?\n\nAt t=9, u=0, first car: [-39, -28], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=9, y=8 is safe.\n\nBut I am at y=7 at t=9.\n\nNow, back to turn t=9.\n\nI am at y=7.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Action U: move to y=8 at turn 10. So at turn 10, I am on y=8.\n\n- Action S: stay at y=7 at turn 10.\n\n- Action D: move to y=6 at turn 10.\n\nBut if I stay at y=7 at turn 10, at t=10, as we saw, on y=7, collision, because of the car with span including 0.\n\nSo I cannot choose S at t=9, because I would be on y=7 at t=10 and collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose D, I go to y=6 at turn 10, but y=6 has cars, and I need to go up, so it might take longer.\n\nSo probably, best to go U at t=9 to y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=8.\n\nNow, at t=10, what is the state on y=8?\n\nu = t-9, at t=10, u=1.\n\nFor y=8, cars:\n\nFirst car: [-39 +4(1), -28 +4(1)] = [-35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+4(1), 36+4(1)] = [29,40], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=10, y=8 is safe.\n\nI am on y=8 at t=10.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn 10, I can choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, I move to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, I am on y=9, which is safe, no cars. Then I reach goal.\n\nBut I need to make sure that at turn 10, when I am on y=8, no collision, which we have, and at turn 11, on y=9, safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which means at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn this case, if I go U at t=10, I reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, minimal H: from t=9 to t=11, that's two actions: at t=9 and t=10.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, with y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at position, then we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have taken actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and we are at y_{t_1 + H}? Let's clarify.\n\nThe position: at turn t, y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} given.\n\nWe take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to some turn, until we reach y=9.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn T, so T = t_1 + H for some H, but the number of actions.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning actions from time t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, start at t_1=9, y_9=7.\n\nIf I take action at t=9: U, then at t=10, y_10 = 7 +1 =8.\n\nThen at t=10, action U, then at t=11, y_11 =8+1=9.\n\nSo at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=9 to t=10, two actions? t=9 and t=10, so H=2 actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for H=2, t=0,1: actions at t_1 +0 and t_1 +1, so t=9 and t=10.\n\nThen y at t_1 + H = t_1 +2 =11, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in this sequence: at t=9, action U, move to y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8, which is safe as we saw at u=1, t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, action U, move to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nWhat about the cars on other freeways? But I only care when I am on that freeway.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=8, and we checked no collision.\n\nEarlier for y=7, at t=10 there is collision, but I am not on y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, at t=10 safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the car spans.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8:\n\nu=1, t=10.\n\nFirst car: [-39 +4(1), -28 +4(1)] = [-35, -24], not include 0.\n\nSecond car: [25+4(1), 36+4(1)] = [29,40], not include 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that I don't collide on the way.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am on the current y, not the next.\n\nIn this case, fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait? For example, if I go directly, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if at t=9, if I stay, but I cannot because at t=10 on y=7 collision.\n\nIf I go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal should be 2 turns: U at t=9, U at t=10.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I start from (0,7), but the position is always x=0, I think, since we only move vertically? The player position is given as (0, y_t), and we move only vertically, I assume, since actions U,D,S change y only.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, I think, based on the actions.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), so x is always 0, I believe.\n\nAnd cars are on the freeways, but the collision depends on whether x=0 is in the car span.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 7, at t=10, there is a car that covers x=0, but since I move to y=8 at t=10, I am not on y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, at later times it has issues, but at t=10 it's fine.\n\nNow, but let me see the other freeways, but since I only go through y=7 and y=8, and y=9, I don't care about others.\n\ny=7 at t=9 I am on, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=10 I am on, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut is y=8 safe at t=10? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can go directly.\n\nAnother thing: the goal is (0,9), and when I reach y=9, I stop, so no need to be on freeway.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 7 has car with span including 0 at t=10.\n\nBut since I move at t=9 to y=8, I am not on y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I were to stay or something.\n\nBut in this plan, I avoid it.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at t=9, but I start at y=7 at t=9, so I need to take action to go to y=8.\n\nAt t=9, I am at y=7, so to be on y=8 at t=10, I need action U at t=9.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=8.\n\nNow, at t=10, I take U to go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut is there a car on y=8 at t=10? No, as above.\n\nBut let me list all freeways for completeness, but I think not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=10 it is safe, but later unsafe, but I am only there at t=10.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have actions at t=9 and t=10.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, which is 2.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible.\n\nCan I reach in one action?\n\nAt t=9, y=7, if I take U, I go to y=8 at t=10, not to y=9.\n\nIf I take U, y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to go from 7 to 8, then 8 to 9, at least two actions.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, actions only change by -1,0,1.\n\nSo minimal possible without cars is 2, and with cars, in this case, it works.\n\nBut why do I think there might be a problem? Oh, freeway 8 has cars that will be at 0 at t=16,17,18, but that is later, not at t=10.\n\nSo for now, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,7) at turn 9.\n\nCar on y=7: at t=9, no collision.\n\nAction U at t=9: then at t=10, player on y=8.\n\nOn y=8 at t=10: as above, cars not at 0.\n\nThen action U at t=10: to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, on y=9, no cars, done.\n\nH=2 turns: actions at t=9 and t=10.\n\nSequence: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nt_1=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 9: a_9\n\nTurn 10: a_10\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, with t relative.\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for H=2:\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nBut after that, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut the action sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so two actions.\n\nNow, but I recall that for freeway 7, at t=10, there is collision, but since I move away, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to check if I can be on y=8 earlier or something, but at t=9 I start from y=7.\n\nAnother thing: in the car update, for freeway 3 and others, but I don't go there, so irrelevant.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 or whatever, but since I am only on y=7 and y=8 briefly, and not on other y, so no issue.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? No, as above.\n\nIf I go S at t=9, but I collide at t=10 on y=7.\n\nIf I go D, to y=6, then I need to come back, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=9, go D to y=6 at t=10.\n\nBut on y=6, I need to check if safe.\n\nFreeway 6: from the table, k=6: cars (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSimilar to y=7, I think.\n\nFreeway 6: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nAt t=9, on y=6, what is the span?\n\nFirst car: right-moving, [τ + s(t-9), h + s(t-9)] = [25 +12(t-9), 36+12(t-9)]\n\nAt t=9: [25,36], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [-23 +12(t-9), -12 +12(t-9)]\n\nAt t=9: [-23,-12], no 0.\n\nNow, when 0 in span for second car: similar to before, at u=1, t=10, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSo at t=10, on y=6, collision if I am there.\n\nIf I go D at t=9, to y=6 at t=10, then at t=10 on y=6, collision, so I cannot.\n\nIf I go S at t=9, stay at y=7 at t=10, collision.\n\nSo only U is possible at t=9 to avoid collision immediately.\n\nThen at t=10 on y=8, safe, then U to y=9.\n\nSo no need to wait.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be boxed.\n\nBut let me write the format.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=9.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the sequence, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSince H=2, actions at t=9 and t=10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I think I should confirm if at t=10 on y=8 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: at t=10, u=1.\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4), span at t: [ -39 +4(t-9), -28 +4(t-9) ]\n\nt=10: [ -39 +4(1), -28 +4(1) ] = [-35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4), [25 +4(1), 36 +4(1)] = [29,40], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd for the car on y=7 at t=10, but I am not on it.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H=2, with actions U at t=9 and U at t=10.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the boxed format.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). The cars on freeway 7 at \\(t = 9\\) have spans that do not include \\(x = 0\\), so no collision occurs.\n- Action choices at \\(t = 9\\):\n  - **U (up)**: Moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn \\(t = 10\\).\n  - **S (stay)**: Remains on \\(y = 7\\) at turn \\(t = 10\\). At \\(t = 10\\), a car on freeway 7 has a span \\([-11, 0]\\), which includes \\(x = 0\\), causing a collision. Thus, S is invalid.\n  - **D (down)**: Moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(t = 10\\). At \\(t = 10\\), a car on freeway 6 has a span \\([-11, 0]\\), which includes \\(x = 0\\), causing a collision. Thus, D is invalid.\n- The only valid action at \\(t = 9\\) is U, moving to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 10\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at \\(t = 10\\) have spans \\([-35, -24]\\) and \\([29, 40]\\), neither of which includes \\(x = 0\\), so no collision occurs.\n- From \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 10\\), the action U moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 11\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, this is safe and reaches the goal.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- The sequence requires 2 actions (minimal \\(H = 2\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 11\\).\n- Actions:\n  - At turn \\(t_1 = 9\\): action \\(a_9 = U\\).\n  - At turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 10\\): action \\(a_{10} = U\\).\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

Since y=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9 because freeways are from y=1 to 8, I think once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on some freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn. But since y=9 is not a freeway, no cars there, so I should be fine once I'm there.\n\nI start at y=8. To reach y=9, I need to move up once. But I have to avoid cars on the way. Specifically, when I move, I need to not be collided with cars on the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=10. So at turn 10, I'm at (0,8). I need to choose actions for turns starting from t=10 onwards.\n\nThe actions affect my position at the next turn. When I take an action at turn t, it determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\na_t at turn t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, if at turn t, I choose a_t = U, then y_{t+1} = y_t + 1.\n\nSimilarly for D and S.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span, then I collide.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T. So for collision at turn T, I only care about the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen I take action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}, not y_T. y_T is my position at the beginning of turn T, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nTurn T: I start at position y_T, then I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nDuring turn T, I am at position y_T, and I might be collided if on freeway y_T and 0 is in car span at turn T.\n\nAfter I take action, I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo for each turn, I need to ensure that at that turn, for the row I'm on, no car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I start at turn 10, position y=8.\n\nI need to get to y=9. Since y=9 is not a freeway, once I'm there, no collision possible.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn. At that turn, since y=9, no freeway, so no collision. But the collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, so if I'm on y=9, it's fine.\n\nNow, I'm at y=8 at turn 10. I need to move to y=9.\n\nBut if I move up at turn 10, then at turn 11, I would be at y=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, I'm still at y=8, so I need to avoid collision on y=8 at turn 10.\n\nThen, if I move up, at turn 11 I'm at y=9, done.\n\nBut I need to check if at turn 10, on row y=8, there is a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or move down, but moving down might not help to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn 10 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k is row k, I think.\n\nSo for row 1 to 8, there are cars.\n\nGiven:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\nk=1: (-24, 11, left, 36)  // direction left, speed 36\n\nk=2: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nk=3: (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)  // multiple cars\n\nk=4: same as k=3? (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nk=5: (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nk=6: (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nk=7: (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nk=8: (-24, -35, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4)\n\nNow, for each car, at turn T, the span is given by the formula.\n\nSince we care about whether 0 is in the span at a particular turn.\n\nAlso, for left-moving, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] but head and tail, I need to know which is which.\n\nFor left-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the right, tail on left, so [h, τ] with h > τ, I think, but let's see the values.\n\nFor example, k=1: (-24, 11, left, 36). h=-24, τ=11? But -24 < 11, so if it's moving left, head at -24, tail at 11? That would be from left to right, but direction left? Inconsistent.\n\nI think there might be confusion in head and tail.\n\nLet me read the car update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, head is on the right, so h > τ, and span is [τ, h], so from left to right.\n\nThen for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], and since it's moving left, head should be on the left, so if it's moving left, head is at the left end, so h should be less than τ? But in the example, for k=1, h=-24, τ=11, and -24 < 11, so if [h, τ] with h=-24, τ=11, that's from -24 to 11, which is increasing, but direction is left, meaning moving to the left, so the car is moving towards decreasing x.\n\nSo at t1, the car spans from x=h to x=τ, with h being the head and τ the tail.\n\nFor left-moving, head is at the left, so if moving left, the left end is the front, so head has smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head has larger x.\n\nIn k=1, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, so from x=-24 to x=11, and moving left, so at t1, it's at [ -24, 11 ], but since moving left, at later time, it shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the span, for collision, we care if 0 is in [low, high] for the span.\n\nFor a car, the span is an interval, and we need 0 in that interval at turn T.\n\nNow for turn T, relative to t1=10.\n\nLet t = T - t1, so at turn t1, t=0.\n\nThen for a car, at time t after t1, the span depends on direction.\n\nFirst, for left-moving car: initial span at t1: [h, τ], so at time t, span = [h - s*t, τ - s*t]\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: initial span [τ, h], at time t, [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nThen, 0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max for the interval.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h - s t, τ - s t], and since h and τ, with h <= τ for left-moving? In k=1, h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, so low = h - s t, high = τ - s t.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [τ + s t, h + s t], with τ <= h.\n\nNow, for each freeway, at a given time t (from t1), we can find if there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nBut for the player, at turn T, which corresponds to time t = T - t1, we are on row y_T, and we need that for row y_T, at time t, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nIn the car state, for each row, there are multiple cars, so we need that for that row at time t, all cars do not have 0 in span, or at least one has 0, then collision.\n\nCollision if for any car on that row, 0 in span.\n\nSo to avoid collision, for the row I'm on at time t, no car should have 0 in its span at that time.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=10, y=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=9 is adjacent, in one move up, but I might need to wait if there is a car at row 8 or something.\n\nFirst, let's find for row 8 at time t=0 (turn 10).\n\nFreeway k=8 has two cars: (-24, -35, right, 4) and (40, 29, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: direction right, so initial span [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ and h.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nGiven: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nThe format is (head, tail, direction, speed)? No, from the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nIn this case, for k=8, first car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right.\n\nSo for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head h=40, tail τ=29, direction right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [29, 40]\n\nNow, at time t (from t1), for right-moving, span = [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\ns=4 for both.\n\nAt t=0, span first car: [-35, -24], second car: [29, 40]\n\nx=0 is not in [-35,-24] since -24 <0? -35 to -24, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, [29,40] all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=0, on row 8, no car covers x=0, so safe at turn 10.\n\nNow, if I take action U at turn 10, then y_{11} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn 11, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I reached the goal.\n\nBut is that it? H=1, action at turn 10: U.\n\nThen at turn 11, I'm at (0,9), done.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nThe sequence is for turns starting from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I am at y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAfter H actions, from turn t1 to t1+H-1, I will be at position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1+H.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, I start at y_{t1}, take action a_{t1}, then go to y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t1+1, I am at y_{t1+1}.\n\nIf I take U at t1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} +1.\n\nIn this case, y_{t1} =8, so if U at t1, y_{11} =9.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am on y=9, not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nAnd I reached in one step.\n\nBut is there a problem? I need to check if at turn t1, when I am on y=8, it was safe, which we saw, at t=0, row 8 is safe.\n\nThen action U at t1=10, done.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on row 8.\n\nAt turn 10, t=0, row 8: cars spans [-35,-24] and [29,40], both away from 0, so yes.\n\nPerhaps for other rows, but since I only was on row 8 at turn 10, and then at turn 11 on row 9, no issue.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), and I did in one turn.\n\nBut why are there other cars listed? Maybe for other rows, but I didn't go there.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if moving up causes issue, but no, since I move directly.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 10, row 8 is safe for future, but at turn 10, I need to be safe at that turn.\n\nAnother thing: when I take action U at turn 10, during turn 10, I am at y=8, and I take action, then I move to y=9 for turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, collision is based on y=8 at time t=0.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am at y=9, no car, safe.\n\nSo minimal H=1, action U at turn 10.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states.\n\nFor row 8, at t=0, spans are about -30 and 35, far from 0.\n\nNow, but the problem is to reach (0,9), and I start at (0,8), so moving up should be fine.\n\nBut why are there cars on other rows? Maybe if I had to go through other rows, but here I don't.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, at other times, but I only care when I am on that row.\n\nIn this case, I was on row 8 only at turn 10.\n\nMaybe I need to consider if I stay or something, but no need.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it should be just one action.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and the other cars are listed, so perhaps for row 8, there is a car that will cover 0 at some time.\n\nAt turn 10, it doesn't, but if I stay, it might.\n\nBut I don't need to stay; I can move up immediately.\n\nPerhaps moving up requires that at the time I move, but no.\n\nAnother point: when I move to y=9, at turn 11, I am on y=9, but since no freeway, no collision.\n\nBut let me read the collision rule again.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd freeways are y=1 to 8, so for y_T=9, it is not a freeway, so no car, so no collision possible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the x-axis, so when y_T between 1-8 and x=0 is in car span, collision.\n\nFor y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nSo in this case, with one move up, I reach.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 10, on row 8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nPerhaps for the car on row 8, let's see if at t=0, it is safe, which it is.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the speed or something.\n\nAnother thing: in row 8, there is a car with (0, -11, right, 12)? No, that's for other rows.\n\nFor row 8, only two cars: one with h=-24, τ=-35, right, so [τ,h] = [-35,-24] at t=0.\n\nSecond car h=40, τ=29, right, [29,40] at t=0.\n\nBoth far from 0.\n\nAt other times, but I'm not on row 8 at other times if I move now.\n\nSo I think H=1, action U.\n\nBut let me see the other rows; maybe there is a reason I can't move immediately.\n\nPerhaps for row 9, but no freeway.\n\nOr maybe the player can only move to adjacent y, which I do.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the action for turn t1 only.\n\nBut the sequence might have multiple actions if needed.\n\nHere, only one.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car on row 5, for example, there is a car (0, -11, right, 12), at t=0.\n\nFor row 5, car: head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nSince right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt t=0, span [-11, 0], which includes x=0.\n\nSo on row 5 at turn t1=10, if I were there, I would collide, but I'm not on row 5.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut for row 8, no issue.\n\nPerhaps at turn 10, if I were to move to row 9, but I don't care about row 9 cars, no cars.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see the turn: current turn t1=10, player at (0,8).\n\nAction at turn 10: U, then at turn 11, position (0,9), done.\n\nAnswer should be: Turn 10: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach at turn t1+H.\n\nFor H=1, I reach at turn 11.\n\nSequence is one action.\n\nBut let me make sure that by moving up, I don't have any issue with the action itself.\n\nThe action U at turn 10 causes y_{11}=9, which is goal.\n\nAnd at turn 10, on y=8, no collision.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut why are there cars on row 1 to 7? Maybe if I had to go through lower rows, but I start at 8, go to 9, no need.\n\nPerhaps the initial position is (0,8), but 8 is freeway, so I need to leave it.\n\nBy moving up, I do.\n\nAnother thought: when I am at y=8 at turn 10, and I move to y=9, at turn 10, I am still on y=8 for collision purposes, and I move to y=9 for turn 11.\n\nNo overlap or anything.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, for turn T=10, I am on y_T=8, and I move to y_{11}=9, so at turn 10, I am not on y=9, so even if cars on y=9 had span covering 0 at turn 10, it wouldn't matter, but there is no y=9 freeway.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, I think it's done with one action.\n\nBut let me check if for row 8, at turn 10, it is safe, which it is.\n\nPerhaps for the car on row 8, let's see when it covers x=0.\n\nFor example, first car on row 8: right-moving, span at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\nSet 0 in [ -35+4t, -24+4t ], so -35+4t <= 0 <= -24+4t\n\nFrom -35+4t <=0, t <= 35/4=8.75\n\nFrom 0 <= -24+4t, t >= 6\n\nSo for t=6 to t=8, approximately, 0 in span, so at times t=6,7,8, which are turns 16,17,18 (since t1=10, t=0 at turn 10, t=1 at turn 11, etc.)\n\nTurn T = t1 + t, so at turn 10+t.\n\nAt t=6, turn 16, etc.\n\nBut at turn 10, t=0, not in, so safe.\n\nSecond car: [29 +4t, 40+4t], all positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, moving up immediately is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go down for some reason, but that would take more turns to reach 9.\n\nFor example, if I go down to 7, then I have to come back, which takes more actions.\n\nBut here not necessary.\n\nSo minimal H=1, action U at turn 10.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nSo for turn t1=10, action a_{10} = U\n\nThen the sequence is just that.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo I think:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me see if there is any mistake.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the grid, so when I am at (0,y), if y between 1-8 and 0 in car span on that row, collision.\n\nAt y=9, no such thing.\n\nPerhaps the grid has y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so safe.\n\nIn the player update, y_{t+1} in [0,9], so boundaries exist.\n\nIn this case, from 8 to 9, fine.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 10, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car states for freeway 8 at turn 10 are:\n- Car 1: head \\(h = -24\\), tail \\(\\tau = -35\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\). For right-moving cars, the span at time \\(t\\) (where \\(t = T - 10\\)) is \\([\\tau + s t, h + s t] = [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\\).\n- Car 2: head \\(h = 40\\), tail \\(\\tau = 29\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\). The span is \\([\\tau + s t, h + s t] = [29 + 4t, 40 + 4t]\\).\n\nAt \\(t = 0\\) (turn 10), the spans are:\n- Car 1: \\([-35, -24]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- Car 2: \\([29, 40]\\), which does not contain 0.\n\nSince no car on freeway 8 has a span containing 0 at turn 10, the position is safe.\n\nTo reach \\(y = 9\\), the player can move up (action \\(U\\)) at turn 10. This results in:\n- \\(y_{11} = y_{10} + \\Delta y_{10} = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nAt turn 11, the player is at (0, 9). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), there are no cars, and thus no collision is possible. The goal is reached in one turn.\n\nNo sequence with fewer turns exists, as the player must move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least one action.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns \\(H = 1\\), and the action sequence is simply \\(a_{10} = U\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\n}",
