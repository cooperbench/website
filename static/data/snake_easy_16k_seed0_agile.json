Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7).\n  - Internal obstacle: (5,6) — this is a single cell that's blocked.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions (head first): [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n    - Head: (3,5)\n    - Tail: (2,4)\n  - Current direction: D (down) — meaning the snake was moving downward to reach (3,5) from (3,6).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,5): value = +1, life_span = 4\n  - (4,5): value = +1, life_span = 7\n  - (5,1): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is D (down), the opposite direction U (up) is not allowed in the next move.\n  \n- **Possible Moves from (3,5)**:\n  - U (up) to (3,6): Occupied by the snake's body — invalid (collision).\n  - D (down) to (3,4): Need to check if this cell is free.\n  - L (left) to (2,5): Need to check if this cell is free.\n  - R (right) to (4,5): This cell has food — need to assess safety.\n\n### Checking Cell Availability\n\n- **(3,4)**:\n  - Not in snake positions.\n  - Not a wall (x=3 is not a border, y=4 is not a border).\n  - No internal obstacle at (3,4).\n  - **Conclusion**: Free to move.\n\n- **(2,5)**:\n  - Not in snake positions.\n  - Not a wall.\n  - No internal obstacle.\n  - **Conclusion**: Free to move.\n\n- **(4,5)**:\n  - Has food (value +1).\n  - Not in snake positions.\n  - Not a wall.\n  - No internal obstacle.\n  - **Conclusion**: Free to move and can eat the food.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven the possible moves (D, L, R), let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move R to (4,5)**:\n   - Eat the food at (4,5).\n   - Snake grows by 1 (new length = 8).\n   - New head position: (4,5).\n   - New tail remains at (2,4) for this turn (since eating means the tail doesn't move).\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Immediate score gain (+1).\n     - Positions the snake closer to (5,5), which has a short life span.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Increases snake length, which might limit future maneuverability.\n     - Need to ensure that after eating, the snake can still navigate safely.\n\n2. **Move D to (3,4)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Snake length remains the same (7).\n   - New head position: (3,4).\n   - Tail moves forward: the segment at (2,4) is removed, new tail is at (1,4).\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Keeps the snake shorter, allowing more flexibility.\n     - Can still reach (5,5) in subsequent moves.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Delays eating, but (4,5) has a longer life span.\n\n3. **Move L to (2,5)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Snake length remains the same.\n   - New head position: (2,5).\n   - Tail moves forward: (2,4) is removed, new tail is at (1,4).\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Keeps the snake short.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Moves away from the food at (4,5) and (5,5).\n     - May make it harder to reach (5,5) before it disappears.\n\n### Assessing Food Life Spans\n\n- **(5,5)**:\n  - Life span: 4 (from turn 16).\n  - Disappears after turn 19 (can be eaten on turns 16, 17, 18, 19).\n  \n- **(4,5)**:\n  - Life span: 7 (from turn 16).\n  - Disappears after turn 22 (can be eaten on turns 16 to 22).\n  \n- **(5,1)**:\n  - Life span: 10 (from turn 16).\n  - Disappears after turn 25 (can be eaten on turns 16 to 25).\n\nGiven this, (5,5) is the most urgent to eat, followed by (4,5), and then (5,1).\n\n### Planning Moves to Eat (5,5)\n\nTo eat (5,5) by turn 19, let's see possible paths:\n\n1. **Path via (4,5)**:\n   - Turn 16: R to (4,5) — eat (4,5).\n   - Turn 17: R to (5,5) — eat (5,5).\n     - This eats both foods quickly but grows the snake rapidly.\n\n2. **Path avoiding immediate eating of (4,5)**:\n   - Turn 16: D to (3,4).\n   - Turn 17: R to (4,4).\n   - Turn 18: R to (5,4).\n   - Turn 19: U to (5,5) — eat (5,5).\n     - This delays eating (4,5) but ensures (5,5) is eaten on time with a shorter snake initially.\n\nThe second path seems more strategic as it keeps the snake shorter for longer, providing more flexibility in future moves.\n\n### Potential Issues with Immediate Eating\n\nIf we eat (4,5) on turn 16 and (5,5) on turn 17:\n\n- After turn 17, the snake is at (5,5) with length 9.\n- From (5,5), possible moves:\n  - U to (5,6): Obstacle — invalid.\n  - D to (5,4): Body segment (from (5,5) to (5,4) is occupied after growth).\n  - L to (4,5): Body segment.\n  - R to (6,5): Free.\n  \nSo, the only move is R to (6,5), which may lead to being cornered later.\n\n### Choosing the Optimal Initial Move\n\nGiven the above, moving D to (3,4) on turn 16 seems better because:\n\n- It doesn't immediately grow the snake, keeping it more maneuverable.\n- It sets up a path to reach (5,5) by turn 19 without rushing.\n- Leaves (4,5) available to eat later if needed.\n\n### Verifying Subsequent Moves\n\nLet's outline the moves from turn 16 to turn 20:\n\n1. **Turn 16**: D to (3,4).\n   - Snake: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] (tail at (1,4)).\n\n2. **Turn 17**: From (3,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (3,5): Body — invalid.\n   - D to (3,3): Free.\n   - L to (2,4): Free.\n   - R to (4,4): Free.\n   \n   Best move: R to (4,4) to head towards (5,5).\n   - Snake: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] (tail at (1,5)).\n\n3. **Turn 18**: From (4,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (4,5): Food — can eat (4,5), but let's prioritize (5,5).\n   - D to (4,3): Free.\n   - L to (3,4): Body.\n   - R to (5,4): Free.\n   \n   Best move: R to (5,4) to get closer to (5,5).\n   - Snake: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] (tail at (1,6)).\n\n4. **Turn 19**: From (5,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (5,5): Food — eat (5,5).\n   - D to (5,3): Free.\n   - L to (4,4): Body.\n   - R to (6,4): Free.\n   \n   Must eat (5,5) now as it's the last chance.\n   - Snake: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

Safe.\n2. **D (Down)**: to (3,1)\n   - (3,1) is the second segment of the snake. Collision with body. Deadly. Cannot move D.\n3. **L (Left)**: to (2,2)\n   - (2,2) is not occupied by the snake or walls. Safe.\n4. **R (Right)**: to (4,2)\n   - (4,2) is the fourth segment of the snake. Collision with body. Deadly. Cannot move R.\n\nSo, the possible safe moves are **U** and **L**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move U to (3,3)**:\n   - Next turn (turn 28), from (3,3), can move R to (4,3) to eat the food (life_span=3 at turn 27, so can eat on turn 28).\n   - After eating, the snake grows to 10 segments. Then must move U to (4,4) on turn 29 (other moves lead to body collisions).\n   - This path allows eating the food at (4,3) and then potentially moving towards (2,5).\n\n2. **Move L to (2,2)**:\n   - From (2,2), cannot reach (4,3) in time to eat it before it disappears (would require being at (3,3) or (4,2) by turn 29, which is not feasible from (2,2)).\n   - Thus, moving L would miss the food at (4,3).\n   - However, moving L opens up space on the left side and allows heading towards (2,5) directly.\n\n### Decision:\nThe food at (4,3) is only available for a short time (until turn 29), and moving U allows us to eat it on turn 28. Missing this food would mean losing a potential point. While moving L opens up space, the immediate opportunity to score by eating (4,3) is more valuable.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nChoose to move **U** to (3,3) on turn 27 to set up eating (4,3) on turn 28.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

This is the optimal move to progress toward (6,4) as planned.\n\n2. **Plan Alignment**: The previous plan (from Turn 29) explicitly states: \n   - Turn 30: R (to (5,4)) → This sets up the snake to eat (6,4) on Turn 31.\n\n3. **Safety**: No collisions or wall violations.

Possible moves:\n1. **Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) is empty and not a wall. Safe.\n2. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - (4,6) is empty and not a wall. Safe.\n3. **Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body (segment 3). Deadly collision. Invalid.\n\nThus, valid moves: **L to (3,5)** or **U to (4,6)**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Option 1: Move L to (3,5)\n- **Immediate**: Moves head to (3,5), direction becomes L.\n- **Next Turn (34)**: From (3,5), can move L to (2,5) to eat food (life span 3, must eat by turn 35). \n  - Eating (2,5) grows snake to length 11, but may trap the snake in the corner (as seen in the earlier analysis).\n- **Alternative**: From (3,5), avoid eating (2,5) and move U to (3,6) or D to (3,4). \n  - Moving U to (3,6) may lead to dead ends later.\n  - Moving D to (3,4) risks getting stuck (e.g., at (3,4) with no exits).\n\n#### Option 2: Move U to (4,6)\n- **Immediate**: Moves head to (4,6), direction becomes U.\n- **Next Turn (34)**: From (4,6), only safe move is L to (3,6) (since U is wall, D is body, R is obstacle).\n- **Turn 35**: From (3,6), can move D to (3,5) to potentially eat (2,5) on turn 35 (last chance). \n  - Eating (2,5) may still lead to trapping the snake.\n- **Alternative**: From (3,6), avoid (2,5) and move to (2,6), but this delays reaching the right-side food.\n\n### Risk of Eating (2,5):\nEating (2,5) grows the snake but risks trapping it in the top-left corner due to the long body. The snake may not have enough space to maneuver afterward, leading to inevitable collision. \n\n### Alternative Strategy:\nAvoid eating (2,5) and prioritize reaching the right-side food (6,4) and (6,5), which have longer life spans. This requires moving rightward early, but the current head direction (L) restricts immediate rightward movement.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\nGiven the risks of trapping the snake by eating (2,5), the safer choice is to **move U to (4,6)** at turn 33. This avoids the immediate danger of trapping and keeps the snake more centralized, allowing future flexibility to navigate toward the right-side food. \n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{U}",

This starts the process of shifting the snake's body to free up (5,4) for future consumption.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Currently occupied by the snake's body (segment 9), so cannot be eaten immediately. Requires the snake to vacate (5,3) first, which is unlikely within its remaining life span.\n2. **(6,2)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 6 (must be eaten by Turn 58). Not urgent.\n3. **(5,2)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 9 (must be eaten by Turn 61). Not urgent.\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (5,3) is not safely reachable within its life span (it will always be occupied or cause a collision if eaten). \n- The other food (6,2) and (5,2) are not urgent, so we should prioritize moving toward them while avoiding collisions.\n- From (1,4), the valid moves are **Down (D)** to (1,3) or **Right (R)** to (2,4).\n  - Moving **Right (R)** to (2,4) is better because it starts moving the snake eastward toward the other food positions (6,2) and (5,2), which are in the eastern part of the grid.\n  - Moving **Down (D)** to (1,3) would take the snake south, away from the food, which is less efficient.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{R}",

This is occupied by the body (second segment), so collision → invalid.\n   - **Left (L)**: To (5,1). Not a wall or body → valid.\n   - **Right (R)**: To (7,1). x=7 is a wall → invalid.\n   - **Up (U)**: To (6,0). y=0 is a wall → invalid.\n\n   **Only valid move is Left (L) to (5,1).**\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (4,1): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears at turn 65).\n   - (1,2): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears at turn 68).\n   - (6,3): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears at turn 71).\n\n### Forced Move Sequence Leading to Death\n\n1. **Turn 61**: Move L to (5,1). No food eaten.\n2. **Turn 62**: From (5,1), direction L (since moved left). Only valid move is L to (4,1) (food eaten).\n3. **Turn 63**: From (4,1), direction L. Only valid move is L to (3,1).\n4. **Turn 64**: From (3,1), direction L. Only valid move is L to (2,1).\n5. **Turn 65**: From (2,1), direction L. Only valid move is L to (1,1).\n6. **Turn 66**: From (1,1), direction L. Only valid move is D to (1,2) (food eaten).\n7. **Turn 67**: From (1,2), direction D. Only valid move is D to (1,3).\n8. **Turn 68**: From (1,3), direction D. No valid moves (all directions blocked or walls).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe snake is forced into a path where it eats two positive foods (at (4,1) and (1,2)) but eventually gets trapped and dies on turn 68. There is no alternative path that allows long-term survival given the current state.\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 61\n\nThe only safe move is **Left (L)** to (5,1).\n\n\\boxed{L}",
