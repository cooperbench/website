So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Only one segment, the head, at (3,3).

Since direction is L, I can't move right immediately because that would be opposite to left. Left is decreasing x, so right would be increasing x, which is opposite.\n> \n> Current direction: L (left, so decreasing x). So possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but not R (right, x+1) because that's reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse means I can't move in the opposite direction on the next turn.

Then on turn 1, when I move the head, the tail stays or moves? Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; growth happens after the move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.

No.\n> \n> In snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail moves to where the second segment was.\n> \n> Initial: positions [H], where H is head.\n> \n> After eating: [new head, old head] so [H1, H0]\n> \n> Then when moving, head moves to new position H2, body moves to H1, so positions [H2, H1], and H0 is removed if no growth, but since we ate, on the turn of eating, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard: on the turn you eat, the tail stays put, so the snake grows by one segment. Then on subsequent moves, both head and tail move.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> From rules: when head moves to food, length increases immediately, so positions include the new head and the previous positions, with tail fixed.\n> \n> For turn 0: start with snake S = [(3,3)]\n> \n> Action: move to (2,3), which has food, so after move, snake is [(2,3), (3,3)]  // head at (2,3), tail at (3,3)\n> \n> Then on turn 1, if I move head to, say, (2,2), then snake becomes [(2,2), (2,3)]  // tail (3,3) is removed? No.\n> \n> Movement: when head moves to a new cell, the body follows: the segment that was behind the head moves to where the head was, and so on, so the tail moves to where the second segment was.\n> \n> After eating at turn 0: positions [A, B] where A is head (2,3), B is tail (3,3)\n> \n> On turn 1, move head to C, say (2,2). Then new positions: head at C (2,2), and the body segment moves from B to A, so [ (2,2), (2,3) ], and B (3,3) is vacated.\n> \n> The tail moves to the position where the neck was.\n> \n> So in this case, after moving to (2,2), snake is [(2,2), (2,3)], and (3,3) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, if I don't eat, tail moves.\n> \n> But here, since I ate, on the turn of eating, tail doesn't move, but on subsequent turns it does.\n> \n> Back to the point.\n> \n> At turn 0, from (3,3), options:\n> \n> 1.

It's turn 1, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,3), and the body is at (3,3). Since the snake has two segments, it's a short snake. Head direction is left (L), so it was moving left to get to (2,3) from (3,3)? Let me think about the movement.\n> \n> Snake positions are given as [(2,3), (3,3)], with head first. So head is at (2,3), and the tail is at (3,3). Since head direction is L, that means it was moving left to (2,3) from (3,3), but (3,3) is the tail, so before moving, head was at (3,3) and it moved left to (2,3), and tail was at (3,3) but now it's moving to where head was or something. I need to recall how snake movement works.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if the snake is at positions [A, B] where A is head and B is tail, and I move in a direction, head moves to a new position, say C, and the tail moves to where head was, so new positions are [C, A].\n> \n> In this case, at turn 1, snake is at [(2,3), (3,3)]. Head direction is L, meaning that on the previous turn, head was at (3,3) and moved left to (2,3). So now, for the next move, I need to choose where to go from (2,3).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head is at (2,3) and direction is L, I can move Up, Down, or Left, but not Right because that would be instant reverse. The rule says \"no instant reverse\", so I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right). So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life_span 9\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life_span 9\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has positive value +1, and they increase length when eaten, except if it's negative food, but here all are value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1) and (3,1), life span 9, meaning they disappear after 9 turns, including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 1, life_span is 9, so it will disappear after turn 9? Countdown decreases each turn, starting from turn 1.\n> \n> Life_span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So for a food with life_span N on turn t, it will be there until turn t + N - 1, and disappear on turn t + N? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So on turn t, if food has life_span N, then on turn t, countdown is N, on turn t+1, countdown is N-1, ..., down to 0, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. But \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that on the turn it spawns, life_span is N, and it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, on turn t + N, it would have countdown 0 and disappear. But since it decreases including current, let's think:\n> \n> - Turn t: life_span = N, countdown starts\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown 1, then after turn t + N, countdown 0 and it disappears.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from when? From the turn it was spawned.\n> \n> In the state, it's given at turn t1=1, so for food at (2,1), life_span=9, so on turn 1, countdown=9. After turn 1, countdown=8, ..., after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears at the end of turn 9 or beginning of turn 10? The rule doesn't specify when exactly it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1), life_span=9, and (1,1), life_span=10.\n> \n> But since we're at turn 1, and life spans are long, 9 and 10, so all food will be around for a while; no immediate danger of disappearing.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are walls, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. But internal cells are from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see.\n> \n> x=0 or x=7 for any y, and y=0 or y=7 for any x, so the wall cells are all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. So the playable grid is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, a 6x6 area? x from 1 to 6 inclusive, that's 6 cells, similarly y, so 6x6 grid.\n> \n> x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6. Yes, 6x6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is within playable area.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,3), tail at (3,3). So both at y=3, head left of tail.\n> \n> Food at (2,1), (3,1), and (1,1). All at y=1, x=2,3,1 respectively.\n> \n> y=1 is the bottom row, since y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable, but y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row above wall.\n> \n> Coordinate system: let's define (x,y), with (0,0) bottom left? Typically in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left, but the walls are given, so I should just use the coordinates as is.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 or x=7 for any y, y=0 or y=7 for any x. So (0,0) to (0,7) wall, (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (0,0) to (7,0) wall, (0,7) to (7,7) wall.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (2,3), body (3,3).\n> \n> Food: (2,1), (3,1), (1,1) all with value 1.\n> \n> I need to move the snake.

At y=1, there is food at (2,1), (3,1), (1,1). But snake is at y=3, so two steps down.\n> \n> Also, since snake is short, only two segments, moving down might be good to get food, but I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,2), that's safe. Then from there, I could go to (2,1) to eat the food at (2,1), but (2,1) has food, and if I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> But let's see the tail position. Tail is at (3,3). When I move, if I don't eat, tail moves to where head was, so if I move down to (2,2), new positions: head at (2,2), body at (2,3)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n> \n> After move, say to (2,2): head moves to (2,2), tail moves to where head was, (2,3).

When you eat, the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move to a food cell, you eat it, so the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So after eating, snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I go to (2,1) and eat, the new tail is added, so positions become head at (2,1), then the previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail (2,3) remains, so [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,3), no food there; food is at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), all not under snake.\n> \n> (3,1) has food, but tail is at (3,3), not at (3,1), so no food under snake body.\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but here it's not, so I can eat food normally.\n> \n> Now, let's consider paths to food.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) is directly below head at (2,3), so I can go down twice: turn 1 down to (2,2), turn 2 down to (2,1) to eat.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,1) is below tail, but tail will move.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) is to the left.\n> \n> But I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider the sequence.\n> \n> First, if I go for immediate food, say to (2,1).\n> \n> But let's see if that's safe.\n> \n> After eating at (2,1), snake becomes longer: positions like [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)] if I went down twice.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go left to (1,1) or right to (3,1), but (3,1) has food, or up.\n> \n> But I need to think about the whole sequence.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider other options.\n> \n> Since there are multiple food, I can plan a path to eat multiple.\n> \n> But snake is short now, so I can maneuver easily.\n> \n> Also, the internal obstacle at (5,6) is far away, at top-right, since y=6 is top row, x=5.\n> \n> y from 1 to 6, so y=6 is top, y=1 bottom.\n> \n> So (5,6) is near top-right corner.\n> \n> Not relevant for now.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> Possible actions at turn 1: U, D, L.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,3), that might be towards (1,1) food.\n> \n> (1,1) is at bottom-left.\n> \n> From (1,3), I can go down to (1,2), then to (1,1) to eat.\n> \n> But let's think about the grid and possible dead ends.\n> \n> The playable area is small, 6x6, with one obstacle.\n> \n> I should sketch a grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells are walls, but since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, the cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are free except obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> So (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake at (2,3) and (3,3), so occupying (2,3) and (3,3).\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) — all on row y=1.\n> \n> Now, at turn 1, I need to choose move.\n> \n> Option 1: Move down to (2,2)\n> \n> Then turn 2, from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) to eat the food at (2,1).

Since only one body segment, tail is now at (1,3).\n> \n> So new snake: [(1,4), (1,3)]\n> \n> Now head direction would be U, since I moved up.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3) but (1,3) is now body, so collision if I go down, or L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4).\n> \n> But D to (1,3) is occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> L to (0,4) wall.\n> \n> So only U or R.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down first.\n> \n> Option 2: Move Down to (1,2)\n> \n> Then head to (1,2), body to (1,3), so snake [(1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> Head direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (1,3) but body, collision; D to (1,1); L to (0,2) wall; R to (2,2).\n> \n> So only D or R.\n> \n> Now, food is at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), all at y=1.\n> \n> If I move down to (1,2), then I can move down again to (1,1) to eat the food there.\n> \n> (1,1) has food, value +1, life span 9.\n> \n> If I go to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go to (1,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But let's think about tail reward danger.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows.\n> \n> Currently snake length 2.\n> \n> If I eat food at (1,1), head moves to (1,1), which is food, so I eat it, length becomes 3, and a new tail segment is added. But where?\n> \n> When head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> Current before eating: positions [(1,2), (1,3)] if I moved down to (1,2) first? I need to sequence.\n> \n> At turn 2, I move down to (1,2).\n> \n> Then turn 3: if I move down to (1,1), which has food.\n> \n> Head moves to (1,1), eats food, so new head position (1,1), and since food is eaten, a new tail segment is added. The body segments: previous was [(1,2), (1,3)], head moves to (1,1), so new positions: head (1,1), then the first body segment is the previous head (1,2), then tail is previous body (1,3). But since I ate food, I add a new segment at the end, so tail becomes (1,3) and new segment? Standard snake: after eating, head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Rule: when eating food, length increases by one, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added there? Or head moves to food, and the body follows, but since no movement for tail, it extends.\n> \n> Typically: in snake, when head moves to a cell with food, it consumes it, and the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: before move, snake at [(1,2), (1,3)] at turn 3 start.\n> \n> I move head down to (1,1), which has food.\n> \n> Head moves to (1,1), consumes food, so the tail (1,3) does not move, and a new segment is added at (1,3)? No.\n> \n> The body segments: the segment that was at (1,2) moves to where? When head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but since we eat food, the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So: head moves to new position (1,1).\n> \n> The first body segment (which was at (1,2)) moves to the previous position of head, but head was at (1,2), so it moves to (1,2)? Confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: the body segments follow the head.\n> \n> After head moves to (1,1), the segment that was behind the head moves to where the head was, which is (1,2).\n> \n> But since we ate food, we add a new segment at the previous tail position.\n> \n> Previous positions: before move, head (1,2), tail (1,3).\n> \n> After head moves to (1,1), the body segment moves to (1,2) (previous head position), and since we ate food, the tail stays at (1,3), and a new segment is added, so now snake has three segments: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> Now, head is at (1,1), and tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Now, is there tail reward danger? Head at (1,1), tail at (1,3), not adjacent; they are two cells apart vertically? (1,1) and (1,3), so y differs by 2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so up/down/left/right, so (1,1) and (1,2) are adjacent, but (1,2) is body, not tail. Tail is (1,3), which is not adjacent to (1,1); they are separated by (1,2).\n> \n> So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> But I need to think further.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go up first.\n> \n> But let's see the food life spans. At turn 2, life spans: (2,1):8, (3,1):8, (1,1):9. Since turn 2, and life span decreases each turn including current, so after this turn (turn 2), life spans become 7,7,8 for (2,1), (3,1), (1,1) respectively? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn 2, life spans are given: for (2,1) life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 more turns? Or including current turn?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, for example, if food has life span L at turn T, it decreases to L-1 at turn T+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> At turn T, with life span L, it means it has L turns left including turn T, so after turn T, it has L-1 left.\n> \n> But for decision, at turn 2, life spans: (2,1):8, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's see.\n> \n> If at turn 2, life span 8, countdown decreases every turn including current, so during turn 2, life span is 8, after turn 2, at turn 3, it becomes 7, and so on, until 0.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1):8, (1,1):9.\n> \n> (1,1) has life span 9, so it lasts longer.\n> \n> But since all are positive and I need to eat, but with long-term thinking.\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> I must choose between U or D at turn 2.\n> \n> If I go down to (1,2), I can reach (1,1) next turn to eat the food.\n> \n> If I go up to (1,4), I go away from food.\n> \n> But I should consider the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders and (5,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is not near me, since I'm at (1,3), so not immediate concern.\n> \n> But I need to think about future paths.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: currently no, but if I eat and grow, it might happen later.\n> \n> Another point: food can spawn under body, but in this case, no food under snake.\n> \n> Special case: food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on it later.\n> \n> But here, no such thing.\n> \n> Now, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, if I move down at turn 2 to (1,2).\n> \n> Then turn 3: from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1) to eat the food there.\n> \n> After eating, as above, snake: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3). Length 3.\n> \n> Head direction down.\n> \n> Now, at turn 3, after eating (1,1), food is consumed, so removed.\n> \n> Remaining food: (2,1) and (3,1) with life spans? At turn 2, (2,1) life 8, (3,1) life 8, (1,1) life 9.\n> \n> After turn 2, life spans decrease: at start of turn 3, (2,1) life 7, (3,1) life 7, (1,1) eaten, so gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I don't eat, but I will eat it.\n> \n> Now at turn 3, snake at [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], head dir D.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (1,1), I can go U, D, L, R, but not opposite to current direction, which is D, so cannot go U (opposite).\n> \n> Current head direction is D, since I moved down.\n> \n> So cannot go U.\n> \n> Possible:\n> \n> - D: to (1,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (2,1)\n> \n> - U: opposite, not allowed? U is up, opposite to down, so cannot go U.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (2,1).\n> \n> (2,1) has food, value +1.\n> \n> So I move to (2,1), eat it.\n> \n> Head moves to (2,1), eats food, so snake grows.\n> \n> Before move: positions [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> Head moves to (2,1), consumes food.\n> \n> Then, the body: first segment moves to previous head (1,1), but since ate food, tail does not move, so new tail segment added.\n> \n> Previous tail at (1,3), stays, new segment? Head new position (2,1), first body segment to (1,1), second body segment to (1,2), and since ate food, add new segment at previous tail position (1,3), so tail now at (1,3), but positions: head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), tail (1,3)? Order: head first, so [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] but (1,2) and (1,3) are both there.\n> \n> The segments: after head moves to (2,1), the segment that was at (1,1) moves to where? The body follows: the segment behind head moves to the previous position of head, which is (1,1), but that position is now occupied? No, positions are updated sequentially.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> Before move: positions [head: (1,1), seg1: (1,2), seg2: (1,3)]  // seg2 is tail.\n> \n> Head moves to (2,1).\n> \n> Then, seg1 moves to where head was, (1,1).\n> \n> Then seg2 moves to where seg1 was, (1,2).\n> \n> But since we ate food, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving, so at (1,3).\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,1), then seg1 at (1,1), seg2 at (1,2), and new tail at (1,3).\n> \n> So snake: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]?

Positions: head (2,1), then (1,1) which is left and down? (2,1) to (1,1) is left, then to (1,2) which is up, then to (1,3) up. So it's a bit bent.\n> \n> But not important for collision.\n> \n> Now head at (2,1), and tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,1): head direction now R, since I moved right from (1,1) to (2,1)?

Earlier: head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), tail (1,3)? I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> After turn 3 move: snake positions: head (2,1), then body segments: first is at (1,1), second at (1,2), tail at (1,3). But (1,2) is between (1,1) and (1,3), but (1,1) to (1,2) is down? (1,1) to (1,2) is increasing y, so down? y=1 to y=2, assuming y increases up? In coordinates, usually y=0 bottom, y=7 top, or?

But here it's written as (2,1,7,1) which might mean x=2, y=1, value=7, life_span=1? But value is supposed to be +1 or -1 for positive or negative food, but here it's 7 and 8? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Look back at the core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\". But in the state, it says \"value\" and it's 7, 7, 8? That must be a mistake.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y), life_span, value. Let me see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 1, 7, 1)\" – I think this is poorly formatted.

Since value should be +1 or -1, but 7 and 8 are large, probably life_span is first or something.\n> \n> Assume that for (2,1,7,1), it means x=2, y=1, life_span=7, value=1. Similarly for others.

Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span - Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) - Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.

The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, with life_span N, after processing turn t, it becomes N-1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, we see food with life_span N.

After moving to (2,1), positions: head (2,1), then previous head (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), so [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)].\n> \n> Then from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), or R to (3,1), or D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) but (1,1) is body, collision.\n> \n> So possible: U to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n> \n> But moving to (3,1) might be similar.\n> \n> But after eating all food at bottom, I might get stuck.\n> \n> Now, alternative: instead of moving down to (1,1), I could move right to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is empty, no food.\n> \n> Then head at (2,2), tail moves to where? When I move to (2,2), no food eaten, so tail moves forward: the tail was at (1,3), it moves to the next segment, but since only two segments, after moving head to (2,2), the body segment at (1,2) becomes tail? Let's see.\n> \n> Initial positions: [head (1,2), tail (1,3)]\n> \n> I move R to (2,2). Since no food, snake moves: head to (2,2), and tail moves off (1,3), so new positions: head (2,2), and since only one body segment, it becomes [(2,2), (1,2)]? No.\n> \n> Snake positions: before move, segments: index 0: head (1,2), index 1: tail (1,3)\n> \n> After moving right to (2,2), new head is (2,2), and the body: the segment that was at (1,2) moves to where the head was? No.\n> \n> In snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, head moves to (2,2). Then the first body segment (which is at (1,2)) moves to the old head position? No.\n> \n> The positions: the new head is at the new position.

So new positions: head (2,2), tail (1,2).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Then, from there, I can move, etc.\n> \n> But (1,2) is now the tail, and it was previously occupied, but no food there.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> If I move D to (1,1), I eat food, grow to length 3, but then next turn I must move R to (2,1) to avoid death, then I can move to (3,1) or up.\n> \n> But let's think long-term.\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) all at y=1.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (5,6), but that's far.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible sequences.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (1,1) at turn 3.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> Turn 3: move D to (1,1), eat food at (1,1), value +1, snake grows: positions [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> Head direction now D (since moved down).\n> \n> Now turn 4: from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, collision.

No.\n> \n> When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> At turn 4 after eating, positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] with (1,3) tail.\n> \n> Move to (3,1), eat, so head to (3,1), then the body is (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), and since eaten, add a new segment, so tail is new at (1,3)? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position or something.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, then the body, and the tail stays.\n> \n> For example, from [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] at turn 4.\n> \n> Move to (3,1), eat food, so new positions: head at (3,1), then the previous head (2,1), then the body (1,1), then (1,2), and the tail (1,3) stays, but since we grow, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, but the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail is still there, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Easier: the snake segments are: after move without eat, segments shift; with eat, head moves to new cell, body segments remain, tail stays, so new segment added at tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it's like the tail is duplicated.\n> \n> Positions: after eating, the new head is at the food cell, and the body includes all previous segments, including the tail, so the tail position is now part of body, and a new tail is the same as old tail if not moved, but since not moved, it's fixed.\n> \n> In this case, before move at turn 4: positions [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ] with (2,1) head, (1,3) tail.\n> \n> Move to (3,1), eat, so new head at (3,1), then the body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), and the tail (1,3) remains, but since we grow, the snake has segments: head (3,1), then (2,1), then (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3) as tail.

long-term survival.\n> \n> In sequence A, after eating three foods, I have a longer snake, which might be harder to maneuv  in the small grid, but grid is 6x6, snake length 5, so 31 cells free, should be ok.\n> \n> If I don't eat, I have a shorter snake, more space, but I delay eating.\n> \n> But since food doesn't disappear soon, I can eat later.\n> \n> But to maximize score, eating now is better because I can potentially eat more if new food spawns, but the state doesn't mention new food spawning, so only these foods.\n> \n> The rules don't say new food spawns, so only the given foods.\n> \n> So I should eat all three to get score 3.\n> \n> If I eat later, score is the same, but I might risk food disappearing or something, but life span is long.\n> \n> For example, if I eat on turn 10, but life span of (1,1) is 8 at turn 3, so at turn 3+8=11 it disappears, so I have until turn 10 to eat it.\n> \n> Plenty of time.\n> \n> But there's no penalty for not eating, but score only from eating.\n> \n> So to have the score earlier or later doesn't matter, but since the game might end, but no end condition, so I need to survive indefinitely, but with finite food, I should eat them.\n> \n> But after eating all, no more food, so I just survive, but score doesn't increase.\n> \n> But the goal is to maximize score, so I need to eat all positive foods.\n> \n> So I should eat them as

Also, an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> - Snake positions: Head at (1,1), then body at (1,2), and tail at (1,3). So the snake is three segments long, moving downward (D) since the head is at (1,1) and the next segment is at (1,2), which is directly below it. Moving down means increasing y? Let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement directions:\n> - U: (x, y+1) – so up increases y\n> - D: (x, y-1) – down decreases y\n> - L: (x-1, y)\n> - R: (x+1, y)\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (1,1), body at (1,2). If the head is at (1,1) and moving to (1,2), that would be moving up, since y increases from 1 to 2. But the head direction is given as D, which is down. Down should decrease y, so from (1,1) to (1,0) would be down, but here the body is at (1,2), which has higher y, so that would be up? I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] – so the head is at (1,1), and the body segments follow. Since it's moving, the direction is from the head to the next segment. From (1,1) to (1,2) is an increase in y, so that should be up (U). But the head direction is given as D. That doesn't match.\n> \n> Head direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\". But positions: (1,1) to (1,2) – if (1,1) is head and (1,2) is the first body segment, that means the snake was previously at (1,2) and moved to (1,1)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Let's read the positions carefully. Snake positions are listed as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So at turn 4, head is at (1,1), then the body is at (1,2), and tail at (1,3). Since the body is at (1,2), which has a higher y-coordinate, that means the snake is moving downwards? No.\n> \n> If the head is at (1,1) and the next segment is at (1,2), that means the head is below the body, so the snake is moving upwards because y=1 to y=2 is increasing y, which is up.\n> \n> But the head direction is given as D, which is down. Down would be decreasing y.\n> \n> There's inconsistency. Perhaps the head direction is the current movement direction, which might not be from the positions directly if the snake just turned.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction the head is facing, meaning the direction it moved to get to the current position.\n> \n> Standard in Snake games, the head direction indicates the last move direction.\n> \n> So, if head direction is D (down), that means on the previous move, it moved down to reach (1,1). But if it moved down to (1,1), where did it come from? Moving down to (1,1) would mean it came from (1,2) or something.\n> \n> Let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> At some point, the snake was at positions before turn 4.\n> \n> Since positions are given at turn 4: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3).\n> \n> If the head just moved to (1,1) with direction D (down), that means it came from (1,2) to (1,1), so previous head was at (1,2), and it moved down to (1,1).\n> \n> Then the body was at (1,3) or something. Positions: before moving, head was at (1,2), body at (1,3), tail at (1,4) or whatever, but after moving down, head is at (1,1), body segments shift, so the old head (1,2) becomes body, old body (1,3) becomes next, etc.\n> \n> At turn 4, positions are after the move.\n> \n> So, at turn 4, head is at (1,1), which it moved to from previous position.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, it moved down to (1,1), so from (1,2) to (1,1) – decreasing y.\n> \n> Then the body at (1,2) was the previous head position, and (1,3) was the previous body, etc.\n> \n> So the snake is moving downward, with head at (1,1), and it can move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (1,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): (1,1+1) = (1,2) – but (1,2) is currently occupied by the body, so moving there would cause collision, deadly.\n> \n> - Down (D): (1,1-1) = (1,0) – but y=0 is a wall, since border y=0, so wall collision, deadly.\n> \n> - Left (L): (1-1,1) = (0,1) – x=0 is wall, deadly.\n> \n> - Right (R): (1+1,1) = (2,1) – this might be possible, need to check.\n> \n> (2,1) is a food position?

Head direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Moving up would be reverse, but in this case, moving up is to (1,2) which is body anyway, so not possible. But for other directions, moving left or right is not reverse of down, so should be allowed. Reverse of down is up, so moving left, right, or down itself is allowed, but down is wall, so only right is possible.\n> \n> Directions: from D, opposite is U. So cannot move U on next turn.

can get to (1,6) quickly.\n> \n> Turn 5: move U to (2,2) from current (2,1)\n> \n> Then turn 6: from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n> \n> Turn 7: U to (2,4)\n> \n> Turn 8: U to (2,5)\n> \n> Turn 9: U to (2,6)\n> \n> Turn 10: L to (1,6) to eat food.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) has life span 10 at turn 4, so at turn 10, life span: at turn 4, life span 10, so countdown 10, turn 5:9, turn 6:8, turn 7:7, turn 8:6, turn 9:5, turn 10:4, so still present on turn 10, can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) at turn 4 life span 6, turn 4:6, turn 5:5, turn 6:4, turn 7:3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, turn 10:0 disappeared, so available until turn 9.\n> \n> In this path, at turn 9, I am at (2,6), and (3,1) is at (3,1), which is far, I can't reach it in one turn, so I miss eating (3,1).\n> \n> But I eat (1,6) at turn 10.\n> \n> If I eat (3,1) at turn 5, I might not reach (1,6) easily.\n> \n> But (1,6) is available longer, so I can go for it first.\n> \n> Since both are +1, and I need to maximize score, eating both is better, but if I can't, eating one is fine.\n> \n> But in this case, by going up early, I can eat (1,6) and survive, whereas if I eat both bottom foods, I might get stuck.\n> \n> Moreover, with the internal wall at (5,6), if I go to the right, I might have issues later.\n> \n> So for long-term survival, it might be better to avoid eating the second food now and go for the top food.\n> \n> At turn 5, if I move to (2,2), I don't eat, so snake length 4, easier to maneuver.\n> \n> Then I can go up to (2,6) and eat (1,6).\n> \n> After that, I can consider other actions.\n> \n> But there might be more food later, but currently only these foods.\n> \n> The state has only these foods listed, so I need to work with what's given.\n> \n> Also, food can spawn later, but not mentioned, so for now, only existing foods.\n> \n> To maximize score, eating both is good, but only if possible without dying.\n> \n> In this case, since the grid is small, with snake length 5, it might be harder to turn around.\n> \n> For example, if I eat (3,1) at turn 5, I'm at (3,1) with body to (1,1), and to go up, I have to go to (3,2), (3,3), etc, but the left side is blocked by the body, so I can't go left, only right or up, so I might be forced to go to the right side, and (1,6) might be unreachable or risky.\n> \n> Whereas if I go up with shorter snake, I can eat (1,6), then the snake is longer, but I'm at (1,6), and I can go down or right.\n> \n> So I think it's safer to go for (1,6) first.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 5, I should move U to (2,2) instead of R to (3,1).\n> \n> Then sequence:\n> \n> Turn 4: R (to (2,1), eat)\n> \n> Turn 5: U (to (2,2), no eat)\n> \n> Then turn 6: from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3) or R to (3,2)\n> \n> To reach (1,6), going U to (2,3) is direct.\n> \n> If I go R to (3,2), I might be able to eat (3,1) later, but as before, it might not be worth it.\n> \n> At turn 6, if I go U to (2,3), then continue up.\n> \n> From (2,2), moving U to (2,3) is fine.\n> \n> Then turn 7: U to (2,4)\n> \n> Turn 8: U to (2,5)\n> \n> Turn 9: U to (2,6)\n> \n> Turn 10: L to (1,6) to eat.\n> \n> Now, at turn 9, when I move to (2,6), the food at (3,1) disappears after turn 9, so on turn 9 it is still present, but I'm at (2,6), can't reach (3,1) in one turn, so I miss it.\n> \n> But I eat (1,6) at turn 10.\n> \n> If at some point I can eat (3,1), but it's not necessary.\n> \n> Now, after eating (1,6) at turn 10, positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), etc., depending on the path.\n> \n> But I need to think about survival after that.\n> \n> First, let's confirm the action sequence for 5 turns ahead from turn 4.\n> \n> Turn 4: move R to (2,1)\n> \n> Turn 5: move U to (2,2)\n> \n> Then for turn 6, from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n> \n> Turn 7: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)  // assuming no obstacles\n> \n> Turn 8: U to (2,5)\n> \n> Turn 9: U to (2,6)\n> \n> But at turn 9, I am at (2,6), and (1,6) is adjacent, but I move on turn 10 to (1,6).\n> \n>

So the snake is in a sort of L-shape: from (2,1) right, then down to (1,1), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,3). Positions are listed head first: so (2,1) is head, then (1,1) is next segment, which means the head moved right from (1,1) to (2,1). Then (1,1) to (1,2)? Let's list the positions in order: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]. So from head to tail: head at (2,1), then the body goes to (1,1), which is left and same y, then from (1,1) to (1,2) down? No, (1,1) to (1,2) is moving down, but the segments are connected.\n> \n> Actually, the positions are the cells occupied. So at turn 5, head is at (2,1), segment 2 at (1,1), segment 3 at (1,2), segment 4 at (1,3). So the snake is: head at (2,1), then it curves down from there to (1,1), then straight down to (1,2) and (1,3). So it's like the head is at (2,1), and the body goes left to (1,1), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,3). So tail is at (1,3).\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to reach (2,1) from previous position. Since previous position was (1,1), and it moved right to (2,1), so direction is R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,1): I can move Up, Down, Left, or Right, but with constraints.\n> \n> - Right: to (3,1) – is that valid? (3,1) is not occupied by body or wall? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=7 is wall, x=3 is fine. y=0 and y=7 walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6), which is far. So (3,1) is empty? But there is food at (3,1) with value +1.\n> \n> Food at (3,1), which is directly to the right.\n> \n> - Up: to (2,2) – y=2, which is within bounds, and not occupied? Current body: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (2,2) is not in body positions. Walls: y=0 and y=7, y=2 is fine. So possible.\n> \n> - Down: to (2,0) – but y=0 is a wall, so down is invalid, collision with wall.\n> \n> - Left: to (1,1) – but (1,1) is occupied by the body segment. However, since it's the second segment, and the snake will move, when I move, the tail will move away, but at the moment of move, if head moves to a body cell, it's collision unless it's the tail and we're eating food or something.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (1,1) is not the tail; tail is at (1,3). So (1,1) is a body segment, not tail. If I move left to (1,1), it would collide with body, since head touches body segment.\n> \n> Specifically: \"head touches any body segment\" – except that moving into tail is allowed because tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (1,1) is the second segment, not tail. So moving left to (1,1) would cause collision because head would be on same cell as body segment before movement is processed? I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves first to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail moves away.\n> \n> But if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment (other than the current tail), it collides.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (1,1), which is currently occupied by the second segment, it would be a collision because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, but only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, tail is at (1,3), so moving to (1,3) might be possible if I can reach it, but from (2,1), moving to (1,3) is not adjacent; adjacent are (2,2), (2,0), (3,1), (1,1).\n> \n> (1,1) is adjacent and occupied by non-tail body, so moving there is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So valid moves from (2,1):\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,1)\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,2)\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,1) but occupied by body, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Right to (3,1) or Up to (2,2).\n> \n> Now, (3,1) has food: positive food, value +1, life span 5.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,1), I eat the food. Since it's positive, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake will have 5 segments.\n> \n> When I eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the tail doesn't move, so length increases by 1.\n> \n> Otherwise, if no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, length same.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (3,1), I eat the food, so new head position (3,1), and the body segments: the previous head (2,1) becomes new body, so snake positions: head at (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), and tail (1,3) stays because we ate food, so new segment added? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> After moving right to (3,1) and eating food: head is at (3,1), then the previous head (2,1) is next, then (1,1), then (1,2), and since we ate, tail stays, so (1,3) remains, and a new segment is not added immediately; the tail doesn't move, so positions become: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]? No.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the segment that was tail stays, and head moves to new cell.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (3,1), then the previous positions except the tail is not removed, so body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), and tail is still (1,3), but since we ate, (1,3) remains part of body, and no new cell is added; the snake just doesn't shorten.\n> \n> Initial positions: 4 segments.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, say (3,1), then body segments shift: (2,1) becomes second segment, (1,1) becomes third, (1,2) becomes fourth, and tail was (1,3), which is removed? No, in snake, when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: positions list: head moves to new position, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So if no eat, from [(x_h,y_h), (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x_t,y_t)] , after move to new head (x_new,y_new), positions become: [(x_new,y_new), (x_h,y_h), (x1,y1), (x2,y2)] and (x_t,y_t) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> But if eat, then positions become: [(x_new,y_new), (x_h,y_h), (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x_t,y_t)] , so tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,1) and eat, positions: head (3,1), then previous head (2,1), then (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3) as tail. So snake has 5 segments: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> If I don't eat, say I move up to (2,2), then no food there, so head to (2,2), body shifts: (2,1) becomes second segment, (1,1) becomes third, (1,2) becomes fourth, and (1,3) is removed.

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be 8x8 since borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions are: head at (3,1), then body segments at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (3,1) from the previous position.\n> \n> Food is at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 8. Life span decreases each turn, including the current one, so after turn 6, it will have 7 turns left, then 6, and so on.\n> \n> I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize this.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on all borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). So the snake is mostly on the bottom row, but with a part going up at (1,2) and (1,3). Since head is at (3,1) and direction is right, it just moved to (3,1) from (2,1), I assume.\n> \n> The positions are listed as [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], so the tail is at (1,3).\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning it's facing right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but I cannot do an instant reverse. Since current direction is R, I cannot go Left immediately because that would be opposite direction. So allowed moves are U, D, R. Not L.\n> \n> Food is at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 8. Since it's turn 6, and life span decreases each turn, after turn 6, it will have 7 left, and so on. I need to eat it before it disappears, but only if it's safe.\n> \n> (1,6) is a position; let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> (1,6) – x=1, y=6. Is this accessible? y=6 is not a border wall since y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is fine. x=1 is also fine.\n> \n> But is there anything blocking it? Snake body: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are on x=1, but y=1,2,3. So (1,6) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Food can spawn under snake body, but in this case, (1,6) is not under snake; snake is at lower y. So it's free.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns. The answer should have an action sequence for turns starting from t=6, and then t=7, etc., for at least 5 turns? The instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the sequence might be for a few turns, I think I need to provide actions for several turns.\n> \n> It says: \"Action Sequence (in order): Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence, probably for as long as I can plan, but at least for 5 turns to show the thinking ahead.\n> \n> But I need to consider the food life span; it has 8 turns left, so I have time, but I should plan to eat it if possible.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move at turn 6.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R (since L is reverse, not allowed).\n> \n> If I go R: to (4,1)\n> \n> If U: to (3,2)\n> \n> If D: to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so D is invalid because it would hit the wall. y=0 is border wall, so moving to (3,0) is impossible. So D is not possible.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L, it's reverse and not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U or R.\n> \n> Now, R to (4,1): what's there? Currently, no food mentioned, and not a wall, so it should be empty.\n> \n> U to (3,2): also empty, I think.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,6) is positive, value 1.\n> \n> Now, the snake tail is at (1,3), and head is at (3,1). To reach (1,6), I need to go upwards.\n> \n> (1,6) is at x=1, y=6. Snake head at (3,1), so I need to move left and up.\n> \n> But I can't go left immediately because direction is R, and reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So at turn 6, if I go U to (3,2), that might be a step towards up.\n> \n> If I go R to (4,1), that's away from (1,6).\n> \n> Since (1,6) is a positive food, I should consider going towards it, but safely.\n> \n> First, let's check if eating it could be dangerous.\n> \n> The food is at (1,6). The tail is at (1,3). If I move the head to (1,6), but the tail is at (1,3), which is not adjacent directly, I think.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (1,6), not on the tail. The tail is at (1,3), which is three cells away vertically. So not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (1,6) and (1,3) are not adjacent; they are separated by (1,4) and (1,5), I assume empty.\n> \n> So if I eat food at (1,6), the snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately? When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn, I think. Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to food cell, it eats, and the tail remains, so new segment is added.\n> \n> But for \"Tail Reward Danger\", it says if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but here the food is not on tail; it's a separate cell.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, life span: 8 turns left starting from turn 6. After turn 6, it has 7 left, then 6, etc. So I need to eat it by turn 6 + 8 - 1 = turn 13? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten up to turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, after turn t, L becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at turn 6, L=8, so:\n> \n> After turn 6: L=7\n> \n> After turn 7: L=6\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 13: L=0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 13 inclusive? At turn t, before moving, I think we check for food.\n> \n> Typically, on each turn, you move, then if head is on food, you eat.\n> \n> But life span decreases each turn, so at the start of turn, life span decreases, then you move.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it decreases at the beginning of the turn or end? But it says \"including current\" turn, so probably at the start of turn, the life span decreases.\n> \n> Then you make your move.\n> \n> If after move, head is on food, you eat it.\n> \n> For food present at turn t with life span L, at the start of turn t, life span is L, then after decrease, it becomes L-1 for the move phase.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\" meaning it will be there for N turns from now.\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span N, it will disappear after N more turns, so it can be eaten during turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1. After turn t+N-1, it disappears before turn t+N.\n> \n> For this food: at turn 6, life_span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 13 inclusive (since turn 6+7=13, turn 6 to 13 is 8 turns? Turn 6: first opportunity, turn 7, ..., up to turn 13, that's 8 opportunities: turns 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. After turn 13, it disappears, so not available on turn 14.\n> \n> Turn 6 to 13 inclusive is 8 turns.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So I have from turn 6 to 13 to eat it, 8 turns, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, back to current move at turn 6.\n> \n> Head at (3,1), can go U or R.\n> \n> Going R to (4,1): what's around? (4,1) is empty, I think. Then from there, I can go U, D, L, R, but R might go towards x=7 wall, x=7 is wall, so (7,y) not accessible.\n> \n> x=4,1 to x=5,1 is possible, but (5,6) is obstacle, but that's at y=6, not relevant here.\n> \n> y=1, so (5,1) should be empty? Internal obstacle only at (5,6), so (5,1) is free.\n> \n> But x=7 is wall, so from (4,1), if I go R to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (7,1) wall, dead end? (7,1) is wall, so I can't go there.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go U from (4,1) to (4,2), etc.\n> \n> But I need to go to (1,6) eventually.\n> \n> Going U from (3,1) to (3,2) might be better to go up.\n> \n> Also, I should consider the snake body and possible collisions.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n> \n> So the body segments: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n> \n> If I go U to (3,2), is (3,2) occupied? Positions: (3,1) is head, (2,1) is next, then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). So (3,2) is not occupied, should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go R to (4,1), also free.\n> \n> But if I go U to (3,2), then head is at (3,2), and the body will move: when I move, the head goes to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the tail segment at (1,3) will be removed, and a new segment added at head, but when I move without eating, the tail moves, so snake positions update.\n> \n> After moving to (3,2), snake becomes: head (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). Tail was (1,3), but since no eat, tail moves to previous position of the last body segment.\n> \n> Standard: when you move without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So from [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], if I move U to (3,2), new head is (3,2), then the body: first segment moves to old head (3,1), second to (2,1), third to (1,1), fourth to (1,2), and the tail (1,3) is removed. So new positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> (1,2) is still there, but now it's the fourth segment, and tail is (1,2)?

Let me clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: It disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,6) with life span 7 on turn 7, it will disappear after turn 7 + 7 - 1? No.\n> \n> The life span is given as the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N on turn T, it will be available until turn T + N - 1, and disappear on turn T + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn T, life span N means it can be eaten from turn T to turn T + N - 1, and on turn T + N, it's gone.\n> \n> So for (1,6): position (1,6), value 1, life span 7 at turn 7. So it appeared on some turn, but we're given life span at current turn. Life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> In the input, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), and life_span is the remaining life at current turn.\n> \n> So for (1,6): at turn 7, life_span=7, so it will last for 7 more turns, meaning it disappears after turn 13? Let's think:\n> \n> - On turn 7, life_span=7, so after turn 7, it decreases to 6 for turn 8, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears. So it disappears at the start of turn when life_span would be 0.\n> \n> Typically, at turn T, with life_span L, it can be eaten during turns T, T+1, ..., T+L-1, and disappears at turn T+L.\n> \n> So for (1,6): turn 7, life_span 7, so available until turn 13 (since 7 + 7 - 1 = 13? Turn T to T+L-1 inclusive).\n> \n> - Available on turns: 7,8,9,10,11,12,13? That's 7 turns: turn 7 to 13 inclusive is 7 turns? Turn 7: L=7, turn 8: L=6, ..., turn 13: L=1, turn 14: L=0, gone. So it disappears after turn 13, meaning on turn 14 it's not there.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,5): value 1, life_span 10 at turn 7, so available from turn 7 to turn 16 (turn 7+10-1=16), disappears on turn 17.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,2), direction U (up). So moving up increases y-coordinate? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases up or down? Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? But here, positions: snake has (3,2), (3,1), etc., and walls at y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> Let's list the grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 impassable. Obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So let's plot this:\n> \n> - (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) head? Positions given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so index 0 is head: (3,2), then (3,1), then (2,1), then (1,1), then (1,2) tail.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Body: (3,1)\n> \n> - Body: (2,1)\n> \n> - Body: (1,1)\n> \n> - Tail: (1,2)\n> \n> So the snake is like: from (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (3,2). So it's a bit coiled. From tail (1,2) to (1,1) down? y=1 to y=2, but positions: (1,2) is tail, then (1,1), so from (1,2) to (1,1) is down if y increases upwards? I need to define coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in such games, (0,0) is top-left or bottom-left? But here, walls at y=0 and y=7, and snake has (3,2), (3,1), so if y=1 and y=2, with U being (x,y+1), so if U increases y, then y=0 might be bottom or top? But it doesn't matter, we can assume y increases upwards for simplicity, so (3,1) is below (3,2) if y increases up.\n> \n> But in the positions, head is at (3,2), previous was (3,1), so from (3,1) to (3,2) is up, since head moved U to (3,2).\n> \n> Direction is U, so at turn 6, head was at (3,1), moved U to (3,2) at turn 7.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position (3,2) with direction U.\n> \n> Since direction is U, I cannot move D next because of no instant reverse. So from (3,2), possible moves: U, L, R. D is opposite to U, so not allowed.\n> \n> U: (3,3)\n> \n> L: (2,2)\n> \n> R: (4,2)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (3,3): x=3 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, so ok.\n> \n> (2,2): x=2, y=2, ok.\n> \n> (4,2): x=4, y=2, ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), not relevant for these moves.\n> \n> Now, body collisions: snake body segments are at (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). None of these are at (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n> \n> But after moving, the body follows, so I need to see the new positions.\n> \n> First, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Food locations: (1,6) and (3,5).\n> \n> (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is near the left border.\n> \n> (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, almost straight up from head.\n> \n> Head at (3,2), so (3,5) is directly above, 3 steps up: (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n> \n> (1,6) is at (1,6), which can be reached via left and up.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (1,6) has life span 7 at turn 7, so available until turn 13.\n> \n> (3,5) has life span 10, available until turn 16.\n> \n> Since (3,5) is closer and directly in path, it might be tempting to go for it immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards (3,5).\n> \n> From (3,2), move U to (3,3).\n> \n> Then from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), then U to (3,5) to eat on turn 9? Let's see turns.\n> \n> Current turn t=7.\n> \n> If I move U at turn 7: head to (3,3), body follows: new positions: head (3,3), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, so snake: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)]? Tail (1,2) moved to (1,1)? Let's track the snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. Tail segment is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> No food eaten yet, so length same.\n> \n> After move at turn 7: head moves to new position, say (3,3). Then the body: the first body segment moves to where head was (3,2), second body to where first body was (3,1), third to (2,1), fourth to (1,1), and tail was (1,2), but since no growth, the last segment is removed, so tail moves to (1,1)? Positions: after move, the snake has segments: new head, then the previous positions except the tail is cut off.\n> \n> Initial positions: indices: 0:head (3,2), 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (1,1), 4: (1,2)\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say P_new.\n> \n> Then new positions: [P_new, old_pos[0], old_pos[1], old_pos[2], old_pos[3]] because old_pos[4] is tail and not included if no growth.\n> \n> Length is 5, so after move without eating, new snake: [new_head, old_head, old_body1, old_body2, old_body3] so positions: new_head, (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) — and (1,2) is gone.\n> \n> Yes: segments: new head, then position of old index 0, then old index 1, then old index 2, then old index 3. Old index 4 is tail, discarded.\n> \n> So after moving to (3,3) at turn 7: snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)\n> \n> Tail is now (1,1).\n> \n> Now, at turn 8, from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), then positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> Then turn 9, move U to (3,5), which has food. Eat food? (3,5) is food position.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, length increases by one, and the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added.\n> \n> So at turn 9, if head moves to (3,5), which has food, so snake grows: new head (3,5), then the body: since food eaten, tail is not removed, so segments: new head, old head, old body1, old body2, old body3, and old tail? Positions before move: at turn 8 end, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> Move head to (3,5), eat food, so new positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and since growth, the last segment (2,1) remains, so now snake: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] length 6.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is consumed, removed.\n> \n> Now, this seems good, score +1.\n> \n> But is there any risk? At (3,5), it's not under body, and no immediate collision.\n> \n> But let's see the area. Walls are borders, obstacle at (5,6), which is not near.\n> \n> But after eating, snake is longer, and we have another food at (1,6).\n> \n> Now, (1,6) is at turn 7 with life span 7, so available until turn 13.\n> \n> After turn 9, we are at turn 10, head at (3,5).\n> \n> From (3,5), we need to go to (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is left and up, but from (3,5), moving L to (2,5), then L to (1,5), then U to (1,6)? But (1,5) might be occupied or not.\n> \n> First, at turn 10, head at (3,5), direction after moving U multiple times, so direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R, D not allowed since opposite? Direction is U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> U: (3,6) — but y=6, and walls at y=7, but (3,6) is ok, but y=7 is wall, so (3,6) is fine, but if go U to (3,6), then y=7 is wall, so cannot go further up, might be dead end.\n> \n> L: (2,5)\n> \n> R: (4,5)\n> \n> Now, to reach (1,6), best to go left.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> From (3,5) at turn 10, move L to (2,5) at turn 10? Turn 10 action.\n> \n> Turn 9 end: head (3,5), positions: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> At turn 10, move L to (2,5): new head (2,5), then body: old head (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — since growth at turn 9, tail (2,1) is still there? After growth at turn 9, positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> At turn 10, move head to new position, no food eaten, so tail moves: new positions: head to (2,5), then old head (3,5), old body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — and tail (2,1) is removed.\n> \n> So snake: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] length still 6? After eating, length increased, so when no eat, it stays, but when moving without eat, tail is cut, so length same.\n> \n> At turn 10 start, length 6, move to (2,5), no food, so new positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — and the last segment (2,1) is gone, so positions: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — that's 6 segments, yes.\n> \n> (3,1) is the last body segment.\n> \n> Now, (2,5) is head, direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Then turn 11, move L to (1,5): new head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), etc.\n> \n> Then turn 12, move U to (1,6): now (1,6) has food, so eat it.\n> \n> Life span of (1,6): at turn 7, life span 7, so on turn 12, it should be available?

The food at (1,6) might be under the snake body or something? In this case, at turn 7, snake positions include (1,1), (1,2), but not (1,6), and as we move, it might be clear.\n> \n> But let's see if (1,6) is accessible.\n> \n> Another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this sequence, when we eat at (1,6), is the tail adjacent?\n> \n> At turn 12, before move, positions: let's trace.\n> \n> After turn 11: if at turn 11 we moved to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), then previous: from turn 10, after move to (2,5), positions: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n> \n> Turn 11 move L to (1,5): no food, so new head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) removed.\n> \n> Snake: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n> \n> Tail at (3,2)\n> \n> Now, head at (1,5), direction L.\n> \n> Move U to (1,6) at turn 12: (1,6) has food, eat.\n> \n> New head (1,6), then body: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) and since growth, no removal, so new segment, tail remains (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] length 7.\n> \n> Now, is head adjacent to tail?

It's turn 8. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm: borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6? But let's see the snake positions: head at (3,3), and body at (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). (1,1) is on the border? y=0 is wall, so y=1 should be playable since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are inside. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). All these are within x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But (1,1) is at corner, but since walls are at x=0 and y=0, (1,1) should be safe, I think. Walls are at coordinates where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so cells like (1,1) have neighbors: left is (0,1) wall, down is (1,0) wall, but (1,1) itself is not wall.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 6. So it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn. Current turn is 8, so it will disappear after turn 8 + 5 = 13? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 8, life span is 6, so it has 6 turns left: it will disappear at the start of turn 14? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Life span: decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will be gone after N turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1. For example, at turn t, life span N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until turn t+N-1, life span=1, and after that turn, it disappears, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> So for food at (1,6), turn 8, life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 8 to turn 13 (since on turn 13, life span=1, eaten and gone; on turn 14, not there).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5), value 1, life span 9, so available from turn 8 to turn 16.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,3), direction U.

So we cannot move down on turn 8.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).

Walls are borders and internal. Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4) is within 1-6,1-6. Internal obstacle at (5,6), not (3,4). So (3,4) is empty? But snake body: positions are (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).

It's turn 9, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). So the snake is moving upwards? Head direction is U, which is up, so from (3,4) to (3,5) if it moves up, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction U. Body segments: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). So the tail is at (2,1), and before that (3,1), so the snake turned left at (3,1) to go to (2,1). So current head direction is U, meaning it was moving up to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns, including this turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span), Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it exists from turn t to turn t+L-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the turn it spawns, countdown starts at L, decreases by 1 each turn, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So for food with life span L, it can be eaten from turn it appears to turn it disappears, which is L turns later? No.\n> \n> If countdown starts at L on turn t, then after one turn, turn t+1, countdown is L-1, and so on, until countdown reaches 0 on turn t+L-1, and then it disappears before turn t+L? I need to be precise.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> In the state, it's given as life_span, which is the remaining life span at the current turn.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (1,6,5,1)\" so (x,y, life_span, value). Here life_span is the remaining life span at current turn t=9.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5,8,1) means at turn 9, it has life span 8, so it will disappear after 8 more turns? \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> In the input, for food, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), and life_span is the current countdown.\n> \n> For (1,6,5,1), at turn 9, life_span=5, so countdown=5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this turn. After 5 turns, on turn 14, it will disappear? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t (current turn), countdown = L\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, countdown=1, then after turn t+L-1, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn t+L-1.\n> \n> For example, if L=5 at turn 9:\n> \n> - Turn 9: countdown=5, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 10: countdown=4, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 11: countdown=3\n> \n> - Turn 12: countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn 13: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 14: countdown=0, disappears, cannot be eaten on turn 14.\n> \n> So it exists from turn 9 to turn 13 inclusive, 5 turns.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,5,8,1): at turn 9, life_span=8, so exists until turn 9+7=16? Turn 9 to turn 16? Countdown starts at 8 on turn 9.\n> \n> After turn 9: countdown=7\n> \n> After turn 10: countdown=6\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 15: countdown=1\n> \n> After turn 16: countdown=0, disappears before turn 17. So can be eaten from turn 9 to turn 16.\n> \n> Turn 9 to turn 16 inclusive is 8 turns: 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Yes, 8 turns.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,4), direction U (up). So possible moves: since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move D. Possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> So grid cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> y=6: ... but y=6 is border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable, but y=6 is not wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are inside, similarly x=1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake:\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> \n> Body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So on the grid:\n> \n> - Row y=6: cells (1,6) to (6,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, so available: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (6,6) I think? x from 1 to 6, so (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) obstacle, (6,6).\n> \n> (5,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> But food at (1,6) and (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) is on the grid.\n> \n> List all positions:\n> \n> - (3,4): head\n> \n> - (3,3): body\n> \n> - (3,2): body\n> \n> - (3,1): body\n> \n> - (2,1): tail\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,6): positive, life 5, so can be eaten until turn 13\n> \n> - (3,5): positive, life 8, until turn 16\n> \n> (3,5) is directly above the head at (3,4), since head is at (3,4), moving U would go to (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) has food, and it's adjacent.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 9: U, L, R (since cannot D)\n> \n> If I move U to (3,5): that's where the food is.

When snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> Movement: in general, when moving, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if no food eaten, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> But if food eaten, tail stays, so a new segment is added where the tail was.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Head moves to the new cell.\n> \n> - If food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows.\n> \n> - If no food, tail moves away, so the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> In this case, if I move U to (3,5), which has food, so I eat it, head at (3,5), body: (3,4) becomes the new segment after head, then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) remains, so positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> Now, is there any collision?

So (3,5) is free, has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) free, (5,5) free.\n> \n> Now, for (3,5), it's at (3,5), which is adjacent to (3,4), the second segment. Since the head is at (2,4), moving to (3,5) would require moving right or up, but let's see possible paths.\n> \n> I should think about getting to the food.\n> \n> But also, there's a risk with tail if we eat near tail.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their positions relative to snake.\n> \n> (1,6): at (1,6), which is left and up from head (2,4). Distance: dx=1, dy=2, so Manhattan distance 3.\n> \n> (3,5): at (3,5), which is right and up from head (2,4). dx=1, dy=1, distance 2.\n> \n> (5,5): at (5,5), right and up, dx=3, dy=1, distance 4.\n> \n> (3,5) is closest, only distance 2.\n> \n> But (3,5) is directly above the neck at (3,4). If we move to (3,5), how?\n> \n> From (2,4), to go to (3,5), we need to move right or up, but current direction is L, so we can move U to (2,5), then from there, we can move R to (3,5), for example.\n> \n> But let's think step by step.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Tail is at (3,1). When we eat food, snake grows, so tail stays or moves depending.\n> \n> Normally, when we move without eating, tail moves forward. When we eat, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Now, the risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,1), and no food there, so not an issue now.\n> \n> Food are at (1,6), (3,5), (5,5), not at tail.\n> \n> Now, let's think about getting to (3,5) quickly.\n> \n> From head (2,4), move U to (2,5). Then from (2,5), we can move R to (3,5) to eat the food, since (3,5) has food.\n> \n> But when we move to (3,5), what happens? The head moves to (3,5), which was food, so we eat it, snake grows, so the new segment is added, but where? When we eat, after moving to food, we add a new segment at the tail or something? Standard snake: when head moves to food, it stays there, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So, after eating, the snake grows, meaning the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added in front or at the end? Typically, the snake grows by not removing the tail segment when it moves.\n> \n> Sequence: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of predecessor, tail is removed.\n> \n> When moving to a food cell, head moves to food, each segment moves to previous position, but tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: if head moves to new cell, and it's food, then the tail position remains occupied, and a new segment is added there, so the snake extends.\n> \n> For collision: when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it's collision except if it's the tail, because tail moves away. But when eating, if we move to tail, it might be a problem.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,5): if we move to (3,5) from (2,5), for example.\n> \n> Current positions before move: let's say at turn 10, we are at (2,4), and we move.\n> \n> Turn 10 action.\n> \n> Suppose we move U to (2,5). Then new head position (2,5), body segments: (2,5) head, then (2,4) becomes body, then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail (3,1) moves to where? After move without eating: head to (2,5), then the segment that was at (2,4) is now at (2,5)? No.\n> \n> When head moves, the second segment moves to where head was, third to where second was, and so on, tail to where the previous tail was or moves to the position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Standard: positions update: new head position, then the old head position becomes the new second segment, old second becomes new third, etc., and the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So after moving U from (2,4) to (2,5) at turn 10:\n> \n> - New head: (2,5)\n> \n> - New body: (2,4)  // old head\n> \n> - Then (3,4)  // old second segment\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - Tail: (3,1) remains? When head moves, the segment that was at (3,4) moves to (2,4), which is now occupied by the new second segment.\n> \n> Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n> \n> After move U to (2,5):\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,5)\n> \n> - Then, the body: the segment that was at (3,4) moves to where head was, (2,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,3) moves to where (3,4) was, (3,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,2) moves to where (3,3) was, (3,3)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,1) moves to where (3,2) was, (3,2)\n> \n> - And the old tail position (3,1) is now empty.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ]\n> \n> Tail is now at (3,2).\n> \n> If we had eaten food, no tail movement, so positions would be [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ] but we didn't eat, so tail moved.\n> \n> In this case, no food at (2,5), so no growth.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,5) is still there.\n> \n> At turn 11, from (2,5), we can move to (3,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5): current position (2,5), previous direction was U (since we moved up), so head direction now U.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U, D, L, R except opposite. Opposite of U is D, so cannot move D. Can move U, L, R.\n> \n> U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) has food, so we can move R to (3,5).\n> \n> Then, move to (3,5): since it has food, we eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> After move: head to (3,5)\n> \n> Then, body segments: the old head (2,5) becomes new second segment.\n> \n> Then, (2,4) becomes new third segment? Let's see positions before move: at turn 11 start, positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ]\n> \n> After moving R to (3,5) and eating:\n> \n> - Head to (3,5)\n> \n> - Since eating, tail does not move, so new positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] and the tail segment at (3,2) remains, and a new segment is added, but since tail doesn't move, the snake grows by keeping the tail where it is.\n> \n> Standard: when eating, after moving head to food, the tail is not removed, so the new segment is added at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: head at (3,5), then the rest: (2,5) where head was, (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), and tail at (3,2) stays, so new snake: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] length 6.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, is this safe? When moving to (3,5), was (3,5) occupied? Before move, positions include (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), etc., (3,5) was not occupied, only food, so no collision.\n> \n> Now, after eating, snake is longer.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term.\n> \n> (1,6) has short life span, only until turn 13, so we might want to eat it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) has long life span.\n> \n> But (1,6) is at (1,6), which is left and up.\n> \n> From current position (2,4), moving left to (1,4) might be a way towards (1,6), but (1,6) is up from there.\n> \n> If we move L to (1,4) at turn 10.\n> \n> Then positions: head to (1,4), body: old head (2,4) to second, then (3,4) to third, (3,3) to fourth, (3,2) to tail, and (3,1) vacated.

It's turn 11, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). So the snake is moving left, since head direction is L. That means from (1,4) to (2,4) was right, but now direction is left, so it must have turned left recently. Positions: (1,4) is head, then (2,4), which is to the right, so the snake was moving right before, but now head direction is L, meaning it just turned left or is facing left now.\n> \n> Head direction is given as L, which means the current direction it's facing is left. So from (1,4), moving left would go to (0,4), but x=0 is a wall, so it can't go left. That's a problem.\n> \n> Let me list the positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n> \n> Since head is at (1,4) and direction is L, moving left would be to (0,4), but x=0 is a wall border, so that's invalid. But the snake must have a valid move; it can't be stuck. Perhaps I misread.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it is currently facing, so for the next move, it can choose to go in a different direction except the opposite, since no instant reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse means it can't go directly opposite. Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So it can go U, D, or L, but L to (0,4) is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> Let's confirm the grid: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (0,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (1,4):\n> \n> - U: up to (1,5)\n> \n> - D: down to (1,3)\n> \n> - L: left to (0,4) — wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: right to (2,4) — but (2,4) is the first body segment. Now, about collisions: head touches body segment except the tail, because tail will move. When moving, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, in this case, (2,4) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,2). So moving to (2,4) would be a collision because it's a body segment, and since the snake moves, the body will be there when head arrives.\n> \n> When the snake moves, all segments shift, so the head moves to a new cell, and the tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> But at the moment of move, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that will not be vacated, it collides.\n> \n> Specifically: after the move, the head should not be on any cell that has a body segment, except that if it moves to the current tail position, it's ok because the tail moves.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> Current positions: head (1,4), body: seg1 (2,4), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,3), tail (3,2)\n> \n> After one move, say the head moves to a new position, then seg1 moves to where head was, seg2 to where seg1 was, and so on, tail moves to where the second last was.\n> \n> So if head moves to (2,4), which is currently occupied by seg1. After move, head is at (2,4), but seg1 moves to (1,4), which was head, so (2,4) now has the head and no body? Let's see:\n> \n> Before move: positions: H(1,4), B1(2,4), B2(3,4), B3(3,3), T(3,2)\n> \n> If head moves to (2,4):\n> \n> - New head position: (2,4)\n> \n> - Then B1 moves to old head position: (1,4)\n> \n> - B2 moves to old B1 position: (2,4) — but (2,4) is where head just moved to, so now head and B2 are both at (2,4)? No.\n> \n> The segments move one by one. When head moves to a new cell, then the next segment moves to the previous head position, and so on.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,4) — now (2,4) has head\n> \n> - Then B1 moves to where head was, which is (1,4)\n> \n> - B2 moves to where B1 was, which is (2,4) — but (2,4) now has the head, so B2 cannot move there; it's occupied? I think in standard snake, the body segments move to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> In terms of cells, after the move, the new positions are:\n> \n> - Head: new position\n> \n> - Body1: previous head position\n> \n> - Body2: previous body1 position\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Tail: previous position of the segment before tail.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Previous positions: H(1,4), B1(2,4), B2(3,4), B3(3,3), T(3,2)\n> \n> If head moves to (2,4):\n> \n> New head: (2,4)\n> \n> Then new body1: old head position (1,4)\n> \n> New body2: old body1 position (2,4) — but (2,4) is now the head, so it's a collision because the head is at (2,4) and body2 is also moving to (2,4), which is the same cell.\n> \n> So yes, moving to a body segment causes collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, it will cause collision because after the move, that cell might still have a body or the head is there with body.\n> \n> The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" after the move.\n> \n> After move, the new positions should not have head on any body cell except possibly the old tail position if it was eaten or something, but here no food.\n> \n> General rule: after moving, if the head is on the same cell as any body segment, it dies. But if the head moves to the cell that was the tail, and the tail moves away, then after the move, the head is on that cell and no body is there, so it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, (2,4) is body1, not tail. Tail is (3,2).\n> \n> So if head moves to (2,4), after move:\n> \n> - Head at (2,4)\n> \n> - Body1 at (1,4) — old head\n> \n> - Body2 at (2,4) — old body1 position, but (2,4) has head, so head and body2 at same cell, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,4) is invalid, collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (0,4) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So from (1,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (1,5)\n> \n> - Down: to (1,3)\n> \n> - Right: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is body, so invalid as above.\n> \n> Current direction is L, but L is invalid due to wall, so I can go U or D.\n> \n> R is opposite to current direction? Current direction is L, opposite is R. But no instant reverse: cannot move opposite on next turn.\n> \n> So from L, I cannot move R immediately.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> So actions for turn 11: either U or D.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All positive food, value +1, so eating increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 11, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 13?

So can be eaten on turns 11,12,13.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): life span 6 at turn 11, so disappears after turn 16? Turn 11:6, 12:5,13:4,14:3,15:2,16:1,17:disappear? Countdown to 1, then disappear on next turn.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" — I think it means after N turns from now, it disappears. Let's read.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for example, if N=3 at turn t, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown=3\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn t+2: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn t+3: countdown=0, disappears?

Since current turn is 12, it will disappear after turn 13? Life span decreases every turn, including current.

So it will be around until turn 16 or something. Life span 5 at turn 12: after turn 12, span=4; turn 13, span=3; turn 14, span=2; turn 15, span=1; turn 16, span=0 gone. So available from turn 12 to 16.\n> \n> - At (5,5): value 1, life span 8. Similarly, it will last until turn 19 or so.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Since walls are at borders, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6, except for the internal obstacle at (5,6). Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 is free, similarly y=1 to 6. And (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> So free cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except (5,6).\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,5)\n> \n> - Body: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> So the snake is 5 segments long. After eating positive food, length increases by one.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so last move was up to (1,5). Since I just moved up, I cannot move down immediately because of no instant reverse. So for turn 12, possible moves are U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,5):\n> \n> - Up (U) to (1,6): y=6, but y=6 is a border wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7. y=7 is wall, y=0 is wall. So y=6 should be free, since walls are at y=0 and y=7, meaning the cells with y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free. Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> In the wall description: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. But the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle at (5,6), which is within playable area.\n> \n> So from (1,5):\n> \n> - Up (U) to (1,6): (1,6) is within bounds, x=1, y=6, and no obstacle mentioned except walls, but walls are at y=7, not y=6. y=6 is not y=7, so it should be free. But (1,6) has food! Food at (1,6) is present.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (0,5): but x=0 is wall, so cannot move left.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (2,5): that should be free, I think. (2,5) is not occupied by snake or wall? Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So (2,5) is empty.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (1,4): but (1,4) is the second segment of the snake. Moving down would hit the body. Also, since head direction is U, moving down is opposite, so not allowed because of no instant reverse. So D is invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, (1,6) has food with value 1 and life span 2. If I move up, I eat it, since head moves onto food.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> First, is head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,3). Head at (1,5). Distance: |1-3|=2, |5-3|=2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up/down/left/right, so (1,5) neighbors: (1,6), (1,4), (0,5), (2,5). Tail is (3,3), which is not adjacent to (1,5). So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, the food is at (1,6), not on the tail. So eating it should be fine.\n> \n> If I eat (1,6), snake grows, so new head at (1,6), and tail stays or moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move. So positions become: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — so length 6.\n> \n> But (1,5) was head, now it's body.\n> \n> Now, after moving, head direction would be U.\n> \n> But life span of this food is 2 at turn 12. If I eat it on turn 12, it's consumed, so no problem.\n> \n> If I don't eat it, it might disappear soon.\n> \n> But I should think ahead.\n> \n> Another move: right to (2,5). Then no food eaten, snake moves, head to (2,5), tail moves to...? When no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell.\n> \n> So if move R to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). Tail was (3,3), but since no eat, tail moves, so (3,3) is free now, and snake is (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). Length still 5.\n> \n> (3,4) was previously there, but after move, the body segments follow.\n> \n> Initial positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n> \n> After moving right to (2,5): new head at (2,5), then the body: previous head (1,5) becomes second segment, then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and the tail (3,3) is left, so removed. So positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> (3,4) is now the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if move up to (1,6) and eat: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, other food: (3,5) and (5,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is above the body segment at (3,4), since (3,4) is y=4, (3,5) is directly above.\n> \n> But food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) has food, and (3,4) is a body segment. So the food is under the snake? Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). (3,4) is occupied, so food at (3,5) is not under snake; it's free, I think. (3,5) is not listed in snake positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, let's list all possible actions for turn 12.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (1,6) - eat food, grow to length 6.\n> \n> Option 2: Move R to (2,5) - no eat, same length.\n> \n> Now, after that, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> But I should consider the life spans.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) has life span 2 at turn 12, so if not eaten now, it might be gone soon. But I can eat it on turn 13 if I move there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food has longer life.\n> \n> Also, risks: moving to (1,6) - is it safe? (1,6) is at the top row, y=6, which is adjacent to wall y=7, but y=7 is wall, so (1,6) is free, but moving up from there might be to (1,7), which is wall, so if head direction is U, and I move U again, I hit wall. But I can change direction.\n> \n> From (1,6), possible moves: if head direction is U, then from (1,6), moving U to (1,7) is wall, illegal. Moving D to (1,5) might be possible, but no instant reverse, so if I moved U to (1,6), head direction is U, so I cannot move D next turn. So from (1,6), with head dir U, possible moves: L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6), D to (1,5) but reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> After moving to (1,6), head direction is U, so for next turn, I cannot move D (down), because that would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up) to (1,7) but y=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> L (left) to (0,6) x=0 wall, cannot.\n> \n> R (right) to (2,6), which should be free? (2,6) is x=2,y=6, within bounds, no obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> D (down) to (1,5), but this is reverse, not allowed because of no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> So from (1,6) with head dir U, only possible move is R to (2,6).\n> \n> If I go to (1,6) on turn 12, then on turn 13, I must move R to (2,6).\n> \n> Then from (2,6), head direction R (since I moved right), so next moves possible.\n> \n> But let's see what happens.\n> \n> If I move R on turn 12 to (2,5), then from there.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (1,6). If I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon. Life span: at turn 12, life span 2, so after turn 12, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1. After turn 13, decreases to 0, gone. So it can be eaten on turn 12 or 13.\n> \n> If I move to (2,5) on turn 12, then on turn 13, I could move to (1,5) or other, but (1,5) is now body? After moving to (2,5) on turn 12, positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> So (1,5) is body, not head. Head is at (2,5).\n> \n> From (2,5), head direction: since I moved right to (2,5), head direction is R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, L to (1,5): (1,5) is body, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> D to (2,4): (2,4) is also body, collision.\n> \n> R to (3,5): (3,5) has food, and it's free? Snake positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). (3,5) is not occupied, so yes.\n> \n> U to (2,6): free, I think.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,5) with dir R: U, R (to (3,5)), or L but L to (1,5) body, invalid; D to (2,4) body, invalid. So only U or R.\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (2,6), or R to (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) has food, value 1.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, consider the tail reward danger.\n> \n> First, let's evaluate moving to (1,6) on turn 12.\n> \n> Turn 12: move U to (1,6) - eat food, snake grows: positions [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] length 6.\n> \n> Head direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 13: from (1,6) with dir U, only possible move is R to (2,6) (since U to wall, L to wall, D reverse not allowed).\n> \n> Move R to (2,6). No food at (2,6), I assume. Food is at (1,6) eaten, (3,5), (5,5). So (2,6) empty.\n> \n> So after move: head to (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), tail (3,3) gone? No, since no eat, tail moves.\n> \n> When no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)] and (3,3) removed. Length still 6? After eating on turn 12, length is 6. Then turn 13, no eat, so head to (2,6), then the segments: (1,6) is now second, (1,5) third, (1,4) fourth, (2,4) fifth, (3,4) sixth, and since no eat, the last segment (3,4) was tail, but it moves? Standard: when moving without eating, the head moves forward, each body segment moves to the previous position, so the tail segment is left behind.\n> \n> Initial after eat turn 12: snake: A=(1,6), B=(1,5), C=(1,4), D=(2,4), E=(3,4), F=(3,3)\n> \n> After move to (2,6) without eat: new head at (2,6), then A moves to where head was? No: the new head is at (2,6), then the first body segment is the previous head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and F=(3,3) is not part of snake anymore.

It's turn 13. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,6), then body segments at (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So the snake is 6 units long. Head direction is Up, meaning last move was Up, so from (1,5) to (1,6).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n> \n> Current turn is 13, so:\n> \n> - Food at (3,5): life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 13 + 4 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,5), life span 4 means it has 4 turns including this one. After 4 turns, it's gone. Since current turn is 13, it will be available on turns 13,14,15,16, and disappear after turn 16. Similarly:\n> \n> - (3,5): available turns 13,14,15,16 (4 turns)\n> \n> - (5,5): life span 7, available turns 13 to 19 (7 turns)\n> \n> - (4,5): life span 10, available turns 13 to 22 (10 turns)\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 13.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints. Head direction is Up, so I cannot move Down instantly, because that would be reverse. So possible moves from (1,6):\n> \n> - Up: to (1,7), but y=7 is a wall border, so I hit wall, die.

After moving, the snake would be: new head at (1,5), then the old head (1,6) becomes part of body, but since we moved down, the tail moves forward? Let's simulate.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no growth, but if we eat food, we grow.\n> \n> If I move Down to (1,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.

But at the moment of move, before updating, (1,5) has a body segment, so moving head there would cause collision with body, except if it's the tail.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

No negative food here.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. It's 8x8? Since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so 8 rows and 8 columns, but walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for any y, (7,y) for any y, (x,0) for any x, (x,7) for any x are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake: positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So let's list the coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (1,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,4)\n> \n> So the snake has 6 segments. Length is 6.\n> \n> Food at: (3,5), (5,5), (4,5). (4,5) is food, but let's see if it's under the snake.\n> \n> (4,5) is a food position, but snake positions are (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So (4,5) is not occupied by snake; it's empty. Similarly, (3,5) and (5,5) are also empty. (3,5) is above (3,4), which is the tail? Tail is at (3,4). (3,5) is directly above the tail.\n> \n> Current head at (2,6), direction right, so moving to (3,6)? But (3,6) might be a wall? y=6 is the top border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, so it's playable.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (2,6) is head, moving right to (3,6) if possible.\n> \n> But what about food? Food at (3,5), which is below (3,6)? (3,5) is one cell down from (3,6).\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid mentally.\n> \n> Assume y increases upwards? In the coordinate, it says U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in such grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left, but here walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> In movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 increases y, so moving up increases y. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So grid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Snake:\n> \n> - Head: (2,6) — that's column 2, row 6 (top row, since y=6)\n> \n> - (1,6) — left of head\n> \n> - (1,5) — down from (1,6), so row 5\n> \n> - (1,4) — down to row 4\n> \n> - (2,4) — right to col 2, row 4\n> \n> - (3,4) — right to col 3, row 4\n> \n> So the snake is like: head at (2,6), then body goes left to (1,6), down to (1,5), down to (1,4), right to (2,4), right to (3,4). So tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,5) at col 3, row 5 — this is directly above tail (3,4) and below (3,6) if it were there.\n> \n> - (5,5) at col 5, row 5\n> \n> - (4,5) at col 4, row 5\n> \n> All in row 5, columns 3,4,5.\n> \n> (4,5) is between (3,5) and (5,5).\n> \n> Now, head at (2,6), moving right. So current direction is R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since moving right, I can go U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. Current direction R, so cannot move L.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U (up, but y=6 is top, y+1=7 is wall, so U to (2,7) is invalid, wall.\n> \n> D (down, y-1, to (2,5))\n> \n> R (right, to (3,6))\n> \n> L (left, to (1,6)) but (1,6) is occupied by body, but let's see collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: cannot move to body segment except tail, but when moving, the tail will move, so it's ok to move to the tail cell if the tail leaves it.\n> \n> Standard snake: if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by tail, it's ok, no collision.\n> \n> But here, body collision: head touches any body segment except that the tail cell is allowed if it's moving away.\n> \n> The rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for a move, if the target cell is occupied by a body segment, it's collision unless it's the tail and we're moving such that the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from head (2,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,7) — y=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,5) — is this free? Snake positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). (2,5) is not in snake, so empty. y=5 is within 1-6, no wall. So valid.\n> \n> - R: (3,6) — (3,6) not in snake positions, and not wall, so valid? x=3, y=6, should be playable. But let's confirm if any body or wall. Snake has (3,4) at tail, but (3,6) is different. So empty, valid.\n> \n> - L: (1,6) — but (1,6) is occupied by the first body segment. It's not the tail; tail is at (3,4). (1,6) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision. Invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move L because it's instant reverse? Current direction R, moving L would be opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or R.\n> \n> Now, D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n> \n> I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), all with positive value, but different life spans.\n> \n> (3,5) life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 17 at latest, since on turn 14 it has 3 turns left: after turn 14, life span decreases to 2, then 1, then 0 on turn 17, gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life span 6, disappears after turn 20.\n> \n> (4,5) life span 9, disappears after turn 23.\n> \n> But I need to eat them safely.\n> \n> Now, (3,5) is close to head. Head at (2,6), so to reach (3,5), I could go down to (2,5), then right to (3,5)? (2,5) to (3,5) is right, but (3,5) is food.\n> \n> But (3,5) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,4), which is directly below (3,5).\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Here, the food is at (3,5), not on the tail. Tail is at (3,4). So (3,5) is not the tail cell; it's a different cell.\n> \n> The danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself, and head is adjacent, then eating it causes immediate collision because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on the food which was tail, but now it's head and the old tail is still there? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, two conditions: head adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to tail cell to eat the food, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move away, and head is on that cell, but since it grew, the new tail is the old position, but head and tail are on same cell? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so when head moves to a food cell, the tail does not move that turn, so the snake increases in length.\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is the current tail position, and that cell has food, then after moving, head is there, and since it ate, the tail stays, but the tail was at that cell, so now head and tail are on same cell? That would be collision.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when head moves to food, the tail doesn't advance, so the new segment is added, so the cell that was tail remains part of body.\n> \n> In this case, if tail cell has food and head moves to it, since head moves to tail cell, and eats food, so tail does not move, so the snake now has head at that cell, and the previous tail is still there, but it's not tail anymore; it's the second last segment. So head and that segment are on different cells? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose tail is at position T, and head moves to T to eat food there. After move: head is at T, and since it ate, the tail does not move, so the segment that was at T is still there, but now it's not tail; the new tail is the segment before that. But the cell T now has both head and the old tail segment? No, positions must be unique.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, it occupies that cell. If that cell was the tail, and food is there, eating means the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows: the head is at the new position, and the tail remains in place, but since it grew, the tail cell now has the last body segment, and a new segment is added at the head position? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the head moves to a food cell, the snake grows by one segment. So, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the new length is old length +1, with the head at the food cell, and all body segments remain, including the tail still at its position.\n> \n> But if the head moves to the tail cell, which has food, then after moving, the head is at the tail cell, and the tail is still at that same cell? That can't be; positions must be unique.\n> \n> The key point: when moving to a cell, if it's the tail cell, and we eat food there, since the tail is moving away normally except when eating, but in this case, moving to tail cell is allowed only if it's not eating or something.\n> \n> From the rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But that is when not eating food. If there is food on the tail cell, and head moves to it, then it's eating, so tail does not move.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to tail cell with food, after eating, head is at that cell, tail does not move, so the cell has both head and the old tail segment? That would be collision.\n> \n> The rule explicitly says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" I think \"newly grown tail\" might be misphrased.\n> \n> Upon second thought: when head moves to a food cell, the snake grows, so the tail remains in place for that turn, meaning that the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at the head position. But since head moved to a cell, that cell is now occupied by head, and if that cell was the tail cell, then before move, tail was there, after move, head is there and tail is still there? Contradiction.\n> \n> I think in terms of positions: at the start, tail is at position T. Head moves to T (which has food). After move, head is at T, and because it ate, the tail does not move, so the body segment that was at T is still at T, but now it's not the tail; it's the second last segment. But T had one segment, now head is at T, so two things at T? Impossible.\n> \n> Therefore, it must be that moving to the tail cell is only safe when not eating food, because the tail moves away. If there is food on tail cell, moving to it to eat causes the tail not to move, so collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> In this case, for (3,5), it's not on the tail; tail is at (3,4). So (3,5) is separate.\n> \n> Only if food is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> Here, no food on tail, so no immediate danger.\n> \n> Back to possible moves.\n> \n> From (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n> \n> If I go R to (3,6), then head at (3,6). Then from there, possible moves: U invalid (y=7 wall), D to (3,5), L to (2,6) but (2,6) is where body was, but after move, the body moves, so (2,6) might be free or not.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6), the snake positions: head was at (2,6), moved to (3,6), so new head (3,6). The body: (1,6) becomes the new neck, but all segments shift: the segment at (1,6) moves to (2,6), (1,5) moves to (1,6), (1,4) moves to (1,5), (2,4) moves to (1,4)? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment is removed, except when eating food.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail moves away from (3,4) to where? The second last segment is (2,4), so tail moves to (2,4)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (2,6), 1: (1,6), 2: (1,5), 3: (1,4), 4: (2,4), 5: tail (3,4)\n> \n> After move right to (3,6): new head at (3,6), then segment 1 moves to old head (2,6), segment 2 moves to (1,6), segment 3 moves to (1,5), segment 4 moves to (1,4), segment 5 (tail) moves to (2,4). And the old tail (3,4) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — tail at (2,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is empty now.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (2,5), new head (2,5), then body: (1,6) moves to (2,6)? Let's see: after move down, head to (2,5), segment 1 to (2,6), segment 2 to (1,6), segment 3 to (1,5), segment 4 to (1,4), segment 5 to (2,4), so positions: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — tail at (2,4).\n> \n> In both cases, tail is at (2,4) after one move.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is at row 5, col 3.\n> \n> If I go to (3,6) first, then from there, I can go down to (3,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> (3,5) has life span 3, so I can eat it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go down to (2,5) first, then I can go right to (3,5) to eat.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> I need to plan for 5 turns or more.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6), which is row 6, col 5.

From there, I can go down to (3,5) to eat the food at (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) has value 1, and life span 3, so on turn 15, after decreasing, it should have life span 2? Turn 14 current, food has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after N turns including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 14, life span 3, so after turn 14, it decreases to 2, then after turn 15 to 1, after turn 16 to 0, so gone on turn 17.\n> \n> So on turn 15, it has life span 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, food has life span L, then after t, it decreases by 1, so at start of turn t, it has L, after the turn, it decreases, and if L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> But when we say \"disappears after N turns\", it means after N turns from now, it is gone.\n> \n> For food at (3,5) at turn 14, life span 3: it will be present on turns 14,15,16, and disappear after turn 16, so not available on turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, to eat it, must be eaten by turn 16.\n> \n> On turn 14, I can eat it if I move to it.\n> \n> But head is at (2,6), food at (3,5), not adjacent directly; I need to move to (3,5) to eat.\n> \n> From (2,6), I can go to (3,6) or (2,5), neither is (3,5), so I cannot eat on turn 14.\n> \n> Earliest I can eat (3,5) is turn 15, by moving to it on that turn.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Back to plan.\n> \n> If on turn 14 I go R to (3,6).\n> \n> Then turn 15, from (3,6), I can go D to (3,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows: head moves to (3,5), eats food, so tail does not move.

No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,6) is wall.\n> \n> Now snake: head (3,6), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So let's list positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (1,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (1,4)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,4)  // since positions are given head first, so (2,4) is the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] so index 0 head, index 1 to 4 body, index 5 tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if it doesn't eat, tail moves away.\n> \n> Head direction is right, so it came from left to (3,6).\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (3,5): below the head? Head is at (3,6), so (3,5) is directly below, since y decreases down? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases up, y decreases down? Let's see:\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — so up increases y\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — down decreases y\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) — left decreases x\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) — right increases x\n> \n> And walls: y=0 and y=7 are bottom and top walls? y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Since U increases y, towards higher y.\n> \n> In the wall description: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But in coordinates, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left?\n> \n> Typically in programming, (0,0) is top-left, y increasing down, but here U is (x,y+1) which might be down if y+1 increases down.\n> \n> I need to clarify.\n> \n> The movement definitions:\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — if y+1 is up, then (0,0) is bottom-left? But in grid terms, often (0,0) is top-left with y down.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's think in terms of the positions given.\n> \n> For example, snake at (3,6), and food at (3,5), with U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1).\n> \n> If U is (x,y+1), and that moves up, then (3,6) to (3,7) would be up, but y=7 is wall, so y=7 is top, so higher y is up.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (3,5) would be down, decreasing y.\n> \n> So (3,5) is below (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, walls: y=0 bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is near top-right, since y=6, x=5.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (3,5): at (3,5), value 1, life span 2. Since current turn 15, after turn 15, life span 1, so disappears after turn 16? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 15, life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 turns from now? Or after this turn?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn 15, life span is 2.\n> \n> After turn 15 is executed, life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> After turn 16 is executed, life span decreases to 0 and it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life span 5, so lasts until turn 19? Turn 15: span 5, after t15:4, t16:3, t17:2, t18:1, t19:0 disappear.\n> \n> (4,5) life span 8, so lasts longer.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for multiple turns. The answer should include an action sequence starting from turn 15, for several turns, at least 5 ahead.\n> \n> But I need to think strategically.\n> \n> First, the snake head is at (3,6), direction right. So possible moves: since it's moving right, it can go U, D, R, but not L, because L is opposite direction, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) on next turn.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 15: U (up, to (3,7)? But y=7 is wall, so (3,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> D: down to (3,5)\n> \n> R: right to (4,6)\n> \n> L: left to (2,6), but (2,6) is occupied by body segment? Positions: (2,6) is the first body segment.\n> \n> But body collision: head touches body segment except that it can move to tail cell if tail moves.\n> \n> Let's read collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because after move, tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 15, from head (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, so invalid, death.\n> \n> - D to (3,5): (3,5) is a food position, but let's see what's there.\n> \n> (3,5) has food, but also, is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So (3,5) is not occupied by snake, it has food.\n> \n> - R to (4,6): (4,6) what is there? Not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 and (5,6). (4,6) is x=4,y=6, which is not wall, since walls are borders and (5,6). Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is within 1-6 in x and y? x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are ok, y=1 to 6, y=6 is not y=7, so (4,6) is valid, no wall. And not in snake positions, so empty? Or could have food? Food is at (3,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (4,6) no food, probably empty.\n> \n> - L to (2,6): but (2,6) is occupied by body segment, the first segment after head. Now, is this a collision? (2,6) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is at (2,4). So moving to (2,6) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail, and tail is at (2,4), not moving to that cell.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to a cell occupied by a body segment causes collision, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (2,4). So moving to (2,6) would kill the snake.\n> \n> Therefore, possible actions at turn 15:\n> \n> - U: invalid, wall\n> \n> - D: to (3,5), which has food\n> \n> - R: to (4,6), empty\n> \n> - L: invalid, body collision\n> \n> So only two choices: D or R.\n> \n> Now, D goes to (3,5), which has positive food. If I eat it, snake length increases by one, so new tail grows.\n> \n> But let's check if there's any danger.\n> \n> First, food at (3,5), life span 2, so it will disappear soon if not eaten.\n> \n> Also, special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here tail is at (2,4), head at (3,6), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,4) and (3,6) are not adjacent; (3,6) to (2,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are same x, y±1 or same y, x±1.\n> \n> So (3,6) adjacent to (3,5), (3,7), (2,6), (4,6). Tail (2,4) is not adjacent to head.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,5), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (3,5), then body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (2,4) stays? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake positions become: head at (3,5), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, so [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, so length same.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, new segment added at tail, so tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> So if eat at (3,5), new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous segments: (3,6) is now body, (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and (2,4) is still tail, but since we ate, we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> Typically: after moving head to new cell, if it's food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (3,5), then the existing body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (2,4) remains, but since we ate, we add a new segment at the position where tail was, so the tail becomes longer.\n> \n> The snake body list: after move without eat, head moves to new position, tail is removed.\n> \n> With eat, head moves to new position, tail is not removed, so snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So initial positions: [head, body1, body2, ..., tail] = [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> If move to (3,5) and eat, new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head (3,6) becomes the first body segment, so [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] and since we ate, we don't remove the tail, so the tail (2,4) is still there, and now the body includes all, so length 7, with tail at (2,4).\n> \n> The positions: index 0: (3,5) head, index 1: (3,6) body, index 2: (2,6) body, index 3: (1,6) body, index 4: (1,5) body, index 5: (1,4) body, index 6: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> (1,4) was body, now still body, and (2,4) was tail, now still tail, but since we added a segment at head, the tail remains.\n> \n> In terms of positions, after eating, the tail cell doesn't change immediately; it stays until next move.\n> \n> But for collision, after the move, the head is at (3,5), and the body segments are (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). But (1,5) is at (1,5), which is different from head.\n> \n> Is there collision? Head at (3,5), body at (3,6), (2,6), etc., all different positions, so no immediate collision.\n> \n> Now, direction: after moving down to (3,5), the new head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (4,6), no food, so no eat, snake moves: head to (4,6), tail moves away. Tail is at (2,4), so it moves to where? Without eat, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment or something.\n> \n> Standard: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So from positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Move head to (4,6), so new head (4,6), then body: (3,6) becomes the first body segment, then (2,6), then (1,6), then (1,5), then (1,4), and tail is removed, so the last segment (2,4) is gone. New positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] and tail at (1,4)? Positions: head (4,6), body1 (3,6), body2 (2,6), body3 (1,6), body4 (1,5), tail (1,4). So tail at (1,4).\n> \n> Length still 6.\n> \n> New head direction R, right.\n> \n> Now, back to choices for turn 15.\n> \n> Option 1: D to (3,5), eat food, score +1, length 7.\n> \n> Option 2: R to (4,6), no eat, length 6.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,5) has short life; if not eaten now, it might disappear soon.\n> \n> After turn 15, it has life span 1 left, so only available on turn 16, then gone.\n> \n> If I don't eat it now, on turn 16 I could eat it, but only if I move there.\n> \n> But let's think further.\n> \n> First, let's consider the grid and possible paths.\n> \n> Food locations: (3,5), (5,5), (4,5). All at y=5, x=3,4,5.\n> \n> (4,5) is directly below (4,6), etc.\n> \n> Also, internal wall at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,6), with direction R.\n> \n> If I go D to (3,5), I eat immediately, but then I'm at (3,5), with direction D.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since direction D, cannot move U (up) next turn.\n> \n> Possible: L to (2,5), R to (4,5), D to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, (2,5): what is there? Snake positions: after eating, body at (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). (2,5) not occupied, no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> (3,4) empty, I think.\n> \n> If I go R to (4,6) on turn 15, I'm at (4,6), no eat, then direction R.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (4,5), which has food; L to (3,6), but (3,6) is now body segment? After move to (4,6), positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So (3,6) is body, so moving L to (3,6) would be body collision, invalid. R to (5,6) but (5,6) is wall, internal obstacle, invalid. So only possible move is D to (4,5).\n> \n> After turn 15 R to (4,6), on turn 16 I can only move D to (4,5), eat the food there.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, life span 8, so I eat it.\n> \n> Then snake grows.\n> \n> But let's see long-term.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,5), which I might want to get later.\n> \n> But (5,5) is near the wall at (5,6).\n> \n> Now, let's think about the tail and possible traps.\n> \n> Current snake shape: head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), then down to (1,5), (1,4), then to (2,4), so it's like a shape: from (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6) down to (1,5) down to (1,4) then right to (2,4). So the tail is at (2,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (3,5), I eat, then snake is at (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So now (1,5) is body, and (2,4) tail.\n> \n> From (3,5), I can move to (4,5) which has food, or to (2,5), or (3,4).\n> \n> If I move to (4,5), I eat again, but I need to be careful not to get trapped.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, so if I go there, I eat it, snake grows more.\n> \n> But let's see the area.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,5) is only available for a short time; if I don't eat it now, it might be gone.\n> \n> But if I go R first to (4,6), then I can only go D to (4,5) on next turn and eat that food.\n> \n> But (3,5) might disappear.\n> \n> Let's compare the two options for turn 15.\n> \n> Option A: D to (3,5) on turn 15, eat (3,5) food.\n> \n> Then turn 16: from (3,5), direction D, possible moves: L to (2,5), R to (4,5), D to (3,4).

(1,5) is body, (2,4) tail.\n> \n> Now from (4,5), direction R, possible moves: U to (4,6), which is empty? After this move, (4,6) is not occupied, since in positions, (3,6) is body, but (4,6) is free.\n> \n> Earlier positions: before move to (4,5), positions were [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5) and eating, new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (2,4)?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n  \n- **Walls**:\n  - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7).\n  - Internal obstacle: (5,6) — this is a single cell that's blocked.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions (head first): [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n    - Head: (3,5)\n    - Tail: (2,4)\n  - Current direction: D (down) — meaning the snake was moving downward to reach (3,5) from (3,6).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,5): value = +1, life_span = 4\n  - (4,5): value = +1, life_span = 7\n  - (5,1): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is D (down), the opposite direction U (up) is not allowed in the next move.\n  \n- **Possible Moves from (3,5)**:\n  - U (up) to (3,6): Occupied by the snake's body — invalid (collision).\n  - D (down) to (3,4): Need to check if this cell is free.\n  - L (left) to (2,5): Need to check if this cell is free.\n  - R (right) to (4,5): This cell has food — need to assess safety.\n\n### Checking Cell Availability\n\n- **(3,4)**:\n  - Not in snake positions.\n  - Not a wall (x=3 is not a border, y=4 is not a border).\n  - No internal obstacle at (3,4).\n  - **Conclusion**: Free to move.\n\n- **(2,5)**:\n  - Not in snake positions.\n  - Not a wall.\n  - No internal obstacle.\n  - **Conclusion**: Free to move.\n\n- **(4,5)**:\n  - Has food (value +1).\n  - Not in snake positions.\n  - Not a wall.\n  - No internal obstacle.\n  - **Conclusion**: Free to move and can eat the food.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven the possible moves (D, L, R), let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move R to (4,5)**:\n   - Eat the food at (4,5).\n   - Snake grows by 1 (new length = 8).\n   - New head position: (4,5).\n   - New tail remains at (2,4) for this turn (since eating means the tail doesn't move).\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Immediate score gain (+1).\n     - Positions the snake closer to (5,5), which has a short life span.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Increases snake length, which might limit future maneuverability.\n     - Need to ensure that after eating, the snake can still navigate safely.\n\n2. **Move D to (3,4)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Snake length remains the same (7).\n   - New head position: (3,4).\n   - Tail moves forward: the segment at (2,4) is removed, new tail is at (1,4).\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Keeps the snake shorter, allowing more flexibility.\n     - Can still reach (5,5) in subsequent moves.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Delays eating, but (4,5) has a longer life span.\n\n3. **Move L to (2,5)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Snake length remains the same.\n   - New head position: (2,5).\n   - Tail moves forward: (2,4) is removed, new tail is at (1,4).\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Keeps the snake short.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Moves away from the food at (4,5) and (5,5).\n     - May make it harder to reach (5,5) before it disappears.\n\n### Assessing Food Life Spans\n\n- **(5,5)**:\n  - Life span: 4 (from turn 16).\n  - Disappears after turn 19 (can be eaten on turns 16, 17, 18, 19).\n  \n- **(4,5)**:\n  - Life span: 7 (from turn 16).\n  - Disappears after turn 22 (can be eaten on turns 16 to 22).\n  \n- **(5,1)**:\n  - Life span: 10 (from turn 16).\n  - Disappears after turn 25 (can be eaten on turns 16 to 25).\n\nGiven this, (5,5) is the most urgent to eat, followed by (4,5), and then (5,1).\n\n### Planning Moves to Eat (5,5)\n\nTo eat (5,5) by turn 19, let's see possible paths:\n\n1. **Path via (4,5)**:\n   - Turn 16: R to (4,5) — eat (4,5).\n   - Turn 17: R to (5,5) — eat (5,5).\n     - This eats both foods quickly but grows the snake rapidly.\n\n2. **Path avoiding immediate eating of (4,5)**:\n   - Turn 16: D to (3,4).\n   - Turn 17: R to (4,4).\n   - Turn 18: R to (5,4).\n   - Turn 19: U to (5,5) — eat (5,5).\n     - This delays eating (4,5) but ensures (5,5) is eaten on time with a shorter snake initially.\n\nThe second path seems more strategic as it keeps the snake shorter for longer, providing more flexibility in future moves.\n\n### Potential Issues with Immediate Eating\n\nIf we eat (4,5) on turn 16 and (5,5) on turn 17:\n\n- After turn 17, the snake is at (5,5) with length 9.\n- From (5,5), possible moves:\n  - U to (5,6): Obstacle — invalid.\n  - D to (5,4): Body segment (from (5,5) to (5,4) is occupied after growth).\n  - L to (4,5): Body segment.\n  - R to (6,5): Free.\n  \nSo, the only move is R to (6,5), which may lead to being cornered later.\n\n### Choosing the Optimal Initial Move\n\nGiven the above, moving D to (3,4) on turn 16 seems better because:\n\n- It doesn't immediately grow the snake, keeping it more maneuverable.\n- It sets up a path to reach (5,5) by turn 19 without rushing.\n- Leaves (4,5) available to eat later if needed.\n\n### Verifying Subsequent Moves\n\nLet's outline the moves from turn 16 to turn 20:\n\n1. **Turn 16**: D to (3,4).\n   - Snake: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] (tail at (1,4)).\n\n2. **Turn 17**: From (3,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (3,5): Body — invalid.\n   - D to (3,3): Free.\n   - L to (2,4): Free.\n   - R to (4,4): Free.\n   \n   Best move: R to (4,4) to head towards (5,5).\n   - Snake: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] (tail at (1,5)).\n\n3. **Turn 18**: From (4,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (4,5): Food — can eat (4,5), but let's prioritize (5,5).\n   - D to (4,3): Free.\n   - L to (3,4): Body.\n   - R to (5,4): Free.\n   \n   Best move: R to (5,4) to get closer to (5,5).\n   - Snake: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] (tail at (1,6)).\n\n4. **Turn 19**: From (5,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (5,5): Food — eat (5,5).\n   - D to (5,3): Free.\n   - L to (4,4): Body.\n   - R to (6,4): Free.\n   \n   Must eat (5,5) now as it's the last chance.\n   - Snake: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), followed by (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning the snake was moving down to get to (3,5) from (3,6)? Let's see the positions: head is (3,5), and the next segment is (3,6). If head is at (3,5) and direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (3,5), so previously it was at (3,6) or something. Positions are given in order: index 0 is head (3,5), index 1 is (3,6), which is above it since y increases or decreases? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might mean y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, it's often y=0 at top, but let's see the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1). So from (3,6) to (3,5) is down, since y decreased from 6 to 5. So y=0 is probably the bottom row? Let's confirm with positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Next: (3,6) — that's above, since y=6 > y=5\n> \n> - Then (2,6) — left, x=2 < x=3\n> \n> - Then (1,6) — left again\n> \n> - Then (1,5) — down, y=5 < y=6\n> \n> - Then (1,4) — down\n> \n> - Then (2,4) — right\n> \n> So the snake is moving: from head to tail: at (3,5) down, but direction is given as D, which matches, since it moved down to here.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,5), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current, so in 4 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 16, if life span is 4, it will disappear after turn 19? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life_span L, after one turn (turn t+1), life_span becomes L-1, and so on, until life_span 1 at turn t + L - 1, and after that turn, it disappears, so it can be eaten only up to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> But for eating, it's when the head moves onto it on that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,5): life_span 4 at turn 16, so:\n> \n> - Turn 16: life_span 4\n> \n> - Turn 17: life_span 3\n> \n> - Turn 18: life_span 2\n> \n> - Turn 19: life_span 1\n> \n> - After turn 19, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 19.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): life_span 7, so disappears after turn 16+7-1=22? Turn 16: L=7, turn 17: L=6, ..., turn 22: L=1, disappears after turn 22.\n> \n> Turn t: L=N, then after k turns, at turn t+k, L=N-k.\n> \n> It disappears when L=0, but since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, L=N, it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1, when L=1, and after that, gone.\n> \n> For (5,5): L=4 at turn 16, so can be eaten on turns 16,17,18,19.

Since current turn is 17, it will disappear after turn 19 (turns 17,18,19 – gone on turn 20).\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 6. Disappears after turn 22 (turns 17 to 22, gone on 23).\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Disappears after turn 25 (turns 17 to 25, gone on 26).\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal wall at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Body: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So, plotting this:\n> \n> - Row y=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> - Row y=5: (1,5), and food at (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> - Row y=4: (1,4), head at (3,4)\n> \n> Also food at (5,1), which is far away.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so last move was down, to (3,4) from (3,5)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (3,4) <- head, then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), etc. So the snake was moving down to (3,4), so from (3,5) to (3,4), direction down.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, I cannot move up (U) next because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (3,4) are: D, L, R. But D is down to (3,3), L is left to (2,4), R is right to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (3,3): is it a wall? y=3, not border, x=3 not border, and not (5,6), so free? But is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So (3,3) is not occupied, and not a wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> (4,4): not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> But I need to consider future positions.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 17.\n> \n> From (3,4), head dir D.\n> \n> Can move: D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n> \n> Cannot move U because reverse.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (5,5), (4,5), (5,1)\n> \n> (5,1) is far, life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> (5,5) has life span 3, so only available for turns 17,18,19. Must eat by turn 19.\n> \n> (4,5) has life span 6, available until turn 22.\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is closer. From (3,4), to reach (4,5): that would be right and up? (4,5) is one right, one up from (3,4).\n> \n> Current position (3,4), (4,5) is x+1, y+1, so not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4). (4,5) is diagonal, not directly reachable in one move.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is two right and one up, or one right and one up from (4,4), etc.\n> \n> I need to think in terms of paths.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with the tail.

The tail is at (1,4), and it's the last segment. When I eat food, the tail doesn't move immediately; it stays, and the snake grows after moving, so the tail position changes.\n> \n> When I eat food, after moving to a food cell, the snake grows, so the new position is added, and tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But for collision, I need to be careful with tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, the tail is at (1,4), and there's no food on it, I think. Food positions are (5,5), (4,5), (5,1), none on snake cells.\n> \n> (1,4) is a snake cell, but no food on it, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the snake's movement. When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward if no food eaten, or stays if food eaten.\n> \n> But for pathing, I need to simulate.\n> \n> Since I need to think 5 turns ahead, I should consider sequences.\n> \n> Also, the internal wall at (5,6) might block access to (5,5) from above, since (5,6) is wall, so I can't go directly to (5,5) from north; I have to come from west, east, or south.\n> \n> (5,5) has neighbors: (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5).\n> \n> But (5,6) is wall, so accessible from (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) has neighbors (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), (5,5). (4,6) might be free or not.\n> \n> (4,6): x=4,y=6, not border, not (5,6), and not in snake positions? Snake has (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), so (4,6) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is free, etc.\n> \n> Now, from current head (3,4), I can:\n> \n> - Move D to (3,3): then I'm going down, away from the food at (4,5) and (5,5). But (5,1) is down there, but far.\n> \n> - Move L to (2,4): that's left, towards the tail area, but tail is moving.\n> \n> - Move R to (4,4): closer to (4,5) and (5,5).\n> \n> (4,4) is right, which is good for approaching the food.\n> \n> Also, from (4,4), I can then move to (4,5) or (5,4), etc.\n> \n> (4,5) is food, so if I go to (4,4) on turn 17, then on turn 18 I can move to (4,5) to eat it, since (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4).\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,5), I might need more moves.\n> \n> But (5,5) has only 3 turns life, so I need to eat it by turn 19.\n> \n> Turn 17: now, turn 18, turn 19.\n> \n> If I don't eat on turn 19, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, let's consider moving to (4,4) on turn 17.\n> \n> Then on turn 18, from (4,4), I can move to (4,5) to eat the food at (4,5), or to (5,4), or to (4,3), or to (3,4) but (3,4) is now body? After turn 17, if I move to (4,4), the new head is (4,4), and the body includes (3,4) which was head, now body.\n> \n> After move, snake positions: head moves to new cell, tail moves if no food eaten.\n> \n> For turn 17 action:\n> \n> Suppose I move R to (4,4).\n> \n> Then new snake positions: head at (4,4), then the previous head (3,4) becomes body, so snake: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] but since no food eaten, the tail (1,4) moves off? Let's see how snake moves.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when you move to a cell, if it's not food, the head moves to new cell, tail is removed. If it is food, head moves to new cell, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,4): is (4,4) food? Food is at (5,5), (4,5), (5,1), so (4,4) not food, so after moving to (4,4), the snake head is at (4,4), the body segments are from (3,4) to (1,4), but since tail moves, the last segment (1,4) is removed, so new positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n> \n> Previous positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] so when head moves to (4,4), it's added, and tail (1,4) removed, so body: (3,4) becomes first body, then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and (1,4) gone. So snake is now 7 segments still, positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n> \n> Tail at (1,5).\n> \n> Now, on turn 18, from head at (4,4), direction: since I moved right, head direction is R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n> \n> But L to (3,4) is reverse?

It's turn 18, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are inside, but I need to confirm.\n> \n> The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, with cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at those borders, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision. So playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to y=6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so rows y=1 to y=6. So the grid is 6x6 playable area? No.\n> \n> Coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. So playable area is (1,1) to (6,6), which is 6x6, but since it's inclusive, 6 cells in each direction? x from 1 to 6 is 6 cells, similarly y, so 6x6 grid.\n> \n> But there's also an internal obstacle at (5,6). So (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,4), and direction is R (right). So current head direction is right.\n> \n> Snake body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] So head at (4,4), then (3,4), which is left of head? Head at (4,4), moving right, so next segment is (3,4), which is west, left. Let's list positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,4)  // directly left of head? (4,4) to (3,4) is left, but since head is moving right, this is the body behind.\n> \n> Perhaps I should think of the snake as moving, so the head is at (4,4), and it's moving right, so the previous position was left of that? The positions are given in order from head to tail. So head is (4,4), then next is (3,4), which is the cell directly to the left of head, so that means the snake was moving left to reach (4,4)? But current direction is R, meaning it just moved right to (4,4)? I need to interpret this.\n> \n> Current head direction is given as R, meaning the snake just moved right to reach (4,4). So before moving, head was at (3,4), and it moved right to (4,4). Then the body segments: after head is (3,4), which is where head was, then (3,5), which is up from (3,4)? (3,4) to (3,5) is up, then (3,6) up, then (2,6) left, then (1,6) left, then (1,5) down.\n> \n> So the tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,5), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? So on turn 18, life span is 2, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's see the rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,5) with life_span 2 on turn 18: after turn 18, countdown decreases to 1. After turn 19, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 18 or 19, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 5, so from turn 18, it will disappear after turn 22 (since countdown: turn 18:5, 19:4, 20:3, 21:2, 22:1, 23:0 gone? But disappears after N turns, so with N=5 on turn 18, it exists for 5 turns including current, so after 5 turns, it's gone. Better to think: it will disappear at the start of turn t1 + N or something. The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Assume turn t1 is current turn. Food has life_span L at turn t1. Then after each turn, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before that turn? Or after?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t1, life_span = L, it can be eaten on this turn. After turn t1, life_span becomes L-1. If L-1 > 0, it can be eaten on turn t1+1, and so on, until life_span =1, it can be eaten on turn t1 + (L-1), and after that turn, it disappears, so not available on turn t1 + L.\n> \n> For (5,5) at turn 18, life_span=2: available on turn 18 and 19, disappears after turn 19.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life_span=5: available turns 18,19,20,21,22, disappears after turn 22.\n> \n> (5,1) life_span=8: available turns 18 to 25, disappears after turn 25.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 18 onwards.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacle at (5,6).

So from (4,4) with direction R, possible moves: U, D, R. L is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (5,5): value +1, life span 2, so must eat by turn 19\n> \n> - (4,5): value +1, life span 5, eat by turn 22\n> \n> - (5,1): value +1, life span 8, eat by turn 25\n> \n> (4,5) is directly above the head?

In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=1 is the bottom row? Let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so if y+1 is up, then higher y is north, so y=0 is south, y=7 is north? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y from 1 to 6, with y=1 south, y=6 north?

It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells outside that are walls. Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 including walls, but the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it just moved up to (4,5) from (4,4), I assume.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so no negative food here. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Since head direction is Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be instant reverse. Current head is at (4,5), direction U, so from (4,4) to (4,5), so next moves: U, L, or R.

Snake positions: (4,5) head, then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), etc. (3,5) is the fourth segment, so it's body, but I can move to a body cell only if it's the tail and moving away, but here it's not tail; tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> Moving to (3,5) would cause collision because head touches body segment that isn't tail.\n> \n> Let's list snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (4,5) head\n> \n> Index 1: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 5: (2,6)\n> \n> Index 6: (1,6)\n> \n> Index 7: (1,5) tail\n> \n> So, if I move left to (3,5), that's the position of index 3, which is a body segment. Since the snake moves, when head moves to a new cell, the tail also moves, so after move, the body shifts.\n> \n> But collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, it dies.

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by tail is safe, but only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is not tail; tail is (1,5). So moving to (3,5) would be collision because after move, head is at (3,5), but before tail moves, that cell is occupied by body.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> So at turn start, positions are as given.\n> \n> After move, head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for collision: if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the current tail, collision occurs because after move, that segment is still there until the shift happens.\n> \n> I think it's simultaneous: head moves to new cell, then body shifts, so if new head position was occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> But if it was the tail, it's okay because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is index 3, not tail, so moving to (3,5) would have head at (3,5) while body segment at (3,5) is still there before shifting, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: moving to x=0,7 or y=0,7 is wall, or internal obstacle (5,6).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,5) with direction U:\n> \n> - U: (4,6) - what is this? y=6, which is not y=7, so within bounds? Walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 are playable, I think.

The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So, the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving east when it arrived at (5,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - One at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so it will disappear after 6 more turns? Life span is given as 6 at turn 20, so it should disappear after turn 25? Let's clarify: \"life_span\" is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn. So, if life_span is N at turn t, it will be gone by turn t + N - 1? No, let's think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0. For example, at turn t, life_span L means it has L turns left, including turn t. So after L turns, it's gone. If L=6 at turn 20, it will disappear after turn 25 (since turn 20: countdown 6, turn 21:5, ..., turn 25:1, turn 26:0 and gone? But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so at turn 20 + N it is gone. I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then during turn t, it is present, and the life_span decreases to L-1 for the next turn. It disappears when life_span becomes 0.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), and life_span is the current life_span at this turn. So for food at (5,1), life_span=6 at turn 20. That means at turn 20, it has 6 turns left including this one, so it will be present for turns 20,21,22,23,24,25, and disappear before turn 26. Similarly, the other food at (4,3) with life_span=9, so it has 9 turns left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards. I should avoid risks, especially collisions.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a small grid.\n> \n> Grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. Also, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So let's list the occupied cells:\n> \n> - Head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Body: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n> \n> (1,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so it came from left, meaning it moved right to (5,5) from (4,5)? Positions are given in order: head first, so snake was at (4,5) before moving to (5,5). Since head direction is R, it was moving right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,5): since head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left. Allowed moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> But I have to consider walls and body.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) is occupied by a wall, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, from (5,5):\n> \n> - Move U: to (5,6). But (5,6) is a wall, so collision, death. Invalid.\n> \n> - Move D: to (5,4). Is this within bounds? x=5, y=4. y=4 is between 0 and 7, not border. x=5 not border. Also, no internal wall there. But is it occupied by body? Check snake positions: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). (5,4) is not listed, so free. But I need to see if moving there causes collision.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows. But collision is if head hits any body segment except the tail, because tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving, if head is at the same position as any body segment except that the tail might be moving, so it's safe to move into the tail position only if the tail moves at the same time.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, the head goes to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. The tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So, for move D to (5,4): current positions: head (5,5), then body: (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n> \n> After move D: head moves to (5,4). Then, the body: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where head was, (5,5). Then (4,4) moves to (4,5), and so on. The tail (1,5) moves to where the previous segment was, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> New positions after move D:\n> \n> - Head to (5,4)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment (which was at (4,5)) moves to (5,5) (previous head position)\n> \n> - Then the second body segment (was at (4,4)) moves to (4,5) (previous position of first body)\n> \n> - Third (was at (3,4)) moves to (4,4)\n> \n> - Fourth (was at (3,5)) moves to (3,4)\n> \n> - Fifth (was at (3,6)) moves to (3,5)\n> \n> - Sixth (was at (2,6)) moves to (3,6)\n> \n> - Seventh (was at (1,6)) moves to (2,6)\n> \n> - Eighth (was at (1,5)) moves to (1,6) — tail moves to (1,6)\n> \n> Now, the head is at (5,4), which is not occupied by any body segment in the new configuration. The cells occupied now: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — all distinct, no collision.\n> \n> (1,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So move D to (5,4) is safe.\n> \n> Now, move R to (6,5): (6,5) is within bounds? x=6, y=5. x=6 is not 7, so not border wall. y=5 not border. No internal wall at (6,5). Is it free? Snake positions don't have (6,5), so yes. After moving, head to (6,5), body: (4,5) moves to (5,5), (4,4) to (4,5), and so on. Tail (1,5) moves to (1,6). Head at (6,5) not colliding with body.

So from (6,6), only possible moves might be down or left, but left to (5,6) wall, down to (6,5), which is where I came from, but since direction changes, it might be allowed? Move down from (6,6) to (6,5) is not reverse if I came from right or up.\n> \n> Direction: after moving to (6,5) with R, direction is R. Then if I move U to (6,6), direction becomes U. Then from (6,6) with direction U, I can move U, D, L, R? But U to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, L to (5,6) wall, D to (6,5). D to (6,5) is opposite to U? Current direction U, opposite is D, so instant reverse not allowed? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction after move to (6,6) is U (since I moved up). Then next move, I cannot move down to (6,5) because that's opposite.\n> \n> Similarly, I cannot move left or right to walls.\n> \n> So from (6,6), no possible moves except down, but down is reverse, not allowed. So I would be trapped and die.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (6,6) is dangerous because from there, I have no safe move next turn.\n> \n> Specifically, from (6,6), with direction U, I can only move up, left, right, but all invalid, down is reverse not allowed.

Food at (5,1) and (4,3), not under snake.\n> \n> (5,1) is at y=1, snake is at y=5-6, so far.\n> \n> (4,3) is at y=3, snake has segments at y=4,5,6, so (4,3) is free.\n> \n> Another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (1,5), head at (5,5), not adjacent.

It's turn 21. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the edges plus that one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). So the tail is at (1,6). Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so from (5,4) to (5,5) is down, since y increases upwards? Let me clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, and y increases upwards, but the movement: U is (x,y+1), which should be up, increasing y. D is (x,y-1), decreasing y, down. So from (5,4) to (5,5) with direction D? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Snake head direction is given as D, down. But the positions: head is at (5,4), and the next segment is (5,5). If head is at (5,4) and moving down, down would be to (5,3), but the next position is (5,5), which has higher y, so that should be up.\n> \n> Inconsistency here. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Snake Positions: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)]\"\n> \n> Head is first: (5,4), then (5,5). So from head to second segment, it's from (5,4) to (5,5), which is increasing y, so that should be moving up, U. But the head direction is given as D, down. That can't be right.\n> \n> Perhaps the head direction is the direction it moved to get to the current head position. Let me see the description.\n> \n> \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and it says \"current turn\", so at turn 21, the head is at (5,4), and it moved down to get there? But from where?\n> \n> The positions list shows the snake segments at turn 21. Head at (5,4), then (5,5), meaning the head was at (5,5) at turn 20, and moved down to (5,4) at turn 21? But moving down from (5,5) to (5,4) would be decreasing y, which is D.\n> \n> (5,5) to (5,4): y decreases, so down, D. Yes, that makes sense. So at turn 20, head was at (5,5), moved down to (5,4) at turn 21, so head direction is D, meaning it just moved down.\n> \n> Now, for the next move, I need to choose a direction: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But I cannot move opposite to current direction immediately, so since I just moved down (D), I cannot move up (U) next, because that would be reverse. So possible moves are D, L, R? No: opposite is U, since U is up, which is reverse of down. So I can move D (down again), L (left), or R (right).\n> \n> Directions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) up\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) down\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) left\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) right\n> \n> Current head at (5,4), last move was D, so cannot move U (opposite). So allowed moves: D (to (5,3)), L (to (4,4)), or R (to (6,4)).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1, and they increase length when eaten.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (5,1), life span 5 at turn 21, so it will disappear after turn 25? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns from now? The description says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> At turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it is present from turn t to turn t+L-1, I think.\n> \n> For example, at turn 21, life span 5, so it is present on turns 21,22,23,24,25, and disappears at turn 26? But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now.\n> \n> Let's interpret: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at current turn, countdown is N, then next turn it becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So when countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning?\n> \n> Typically, it should be that at the start of turn, if countdown >0, food is present, and after the turn, countdown decreases, and if it reaches 0, food disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves to food cell during a turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> So for food at (5,1), life span 5 at turn 21, so countdown starts at 5 on turn 21. After turn 21, countdown becomes 4, and so on. After turn 25, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 25 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Assume: at the beginning of turn t, food with life span L has countdown L. During the turn, if head moves to it, it can be eaten. At the end of the turn, countdown decreases by 1. If countdown becomes 0 after decrease, food is removed.\n> \n> So for food with life span N at turn t:\n> \n> - Present on turn t with countdown N\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown N-1\n> \n> - Present until countdown >0, so on turn t + k, countdown N - k, for k from 0 to N-1. On turn t + N, countdown 0, removed before turn.\n> \n> On turn t, countdown is N, can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown becomes N-1.\n> \n> On turn t+1, countdown N-1, can be eaten.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> On turn t + N - 1, countdown 1, can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn t + N - 1, countdown becomes 0, food removed, not present on turn t + N.\n> \n> So for (5,1) at turn 21, life span 5: can be eaten on turns 21,22,23,24,25. Disappears before turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) life span 8: can be eaten from turn 21 to 28.\n> \n> Both have value 1, positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there. Also internal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (5,4)\n> \n> Body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — tail at (1,6)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells by snake: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n> \n> Also wall at (5,6), which is not occupied by snake, but is obstacle.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) and (4,3).\n> \n> Now, current head position: (5,4)\n> \n> Possible moves from here:\n> \n> - D: down to (5,3) — is this safe? (5,3) is not wall, not snake body? Snake body: (5,4) is head, will move away, (5,5) is body, but (5,3) is empty? Let's see cells.\n> \n> Occupied: (5,4) head, (5,5) body, etc. (5,3) is not in the list, so should be free, unless wall. y=3, x=5, not border, not (5,6) obstacle, so (5,3) is free.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,4) — (4,4) is a body segment. But is it safe? The tail is at (1,6), so (4,4) is not tail, it's part of body. Moving to a body cell is deadly, except if it's the tail and the tail moves.\n> \n> General rule: head touches any body segment except the tail, it dies. But if it moves to the tail cell, and the tail moves away, it might be ok, but only if the tail was about to move.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it collides unless it is the tail segment and the tail moves forward in the same turn.\n> \n> In this case, (4,4) is occupied by a body segment. Is it the tail? Tail is at (1,6), so (4,4) is not tail, it's the fourth segment or something. Positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,4), 4: (3,4), etc. So (4,4) is segment 3, not tail. So moving to (4,4) would collide with body, deadly. So L to (4,4) is not safe.\n> \n> - R: right to (6,4) — (6,4) is not in snake positions, not wall? x=6, y=4, borders are x=0,7, so x=6<7, y=4 not 0 or 7, and no internal obstacle mentioned, so should be free and safe.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok.\n> \n> Also, cannot move U because opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible actions: D to (5,3), R to (6,4). L is invalid because body collision.\n> \n> Now, food: (5,1) is below, at y=1, and (4,3) is at (4,3), which is left and down from head.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), (4,3) is left and down, but y=3<4, so down and left.\n> \n> (5,1) is directly below at y=1.\n> \n> Also, life spans: (5,1) has life 5, so must be eaten by turn 25, which is 4 turns from now (turn 21 to 25 is 5 turns? Turn 21: present, 22,23,24,25, so 5 opportunities.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) has life 8, more time.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's think about getting the food.\n> \n> (4,3) is closer to head: from (5,4) to (4,3) is one step left and down, but I can't go directly because moving left to (4,4) is body, not possible. So I need to go around.\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> From (5,4), I can go D to (5,3) or R to (6,4).\n> \n> If I go D to (5,3), then from there, I can go to (4,3) since (4,3) is food, and adjacent.\n> \n> (5,3) to (4,3) is left, which should be possible if no body there.\n> \n> At turn 21, after moving to (5,3), the snake will be: head at (5,3), then body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), tail (1,6). When head moves to (5,3), the tail might move or not, depending on growth.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so length increases. If not, length same.\n> \n> Currently, no food eaten this turn, I assume, since we're deciding the move.\n> \n> At turn 21, we are deciding the action for turn 21, which will move the head to a new position.\n> \n> If I move to a food cell, I eat it, length increases, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> If not, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,4), if I move D to (5,3), (5,3) is not food, so no eat, tail moves, so snake becomes: head (5,3), then segments: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — tail was (1,6), moves away, so positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)]? Let's list:\n> \n> Original: positions index 0 to 8: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n> \n> After move to (5,3) without eating: head to (5,3), then body: previous head and body except tail removed? Standard: head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead. So new head at (5,3), then segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,4), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (5,5), and so on, up to segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was, (2,6), and tail (segment 8) was at (1,6), but since tail moves, (1,6) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: head: (5,3)\n> \n> Body: segment 1: (5,4)  // where head was\n> \n> Segment 2: (5,5)  // where segment 1 was\n> \n> Segment 3: (4,5)  // where segment 2 was\n> \n> Segment 4: (4,4)  // where segment 3 was\n> \n> Segment 5: (3,4)  // where segment 4 was\n> \n> Segment 6: (3,5)  // where segment 5 was\n> \n> Segment 7: (3,6)  // where segment 6 was\n> \n> Segment 8: (2,6)  // where segment 7 was\n> \n> And (1,6) is free now.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had eaten, tail stays.\n> \n> But here, no food at (5,3), so tail moves.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), I can move to (4,3), which is food.\n> \n> (4,3) is adjacent left.\n> \n> Can I move L to (4,3)? From (5,3), moving L to (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is not occupied by body now? After above, body positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — so (4,3) is not in this list, and not wall, so yes, I can move to (4,3) and eat the food.\n> \n> Then, after eating, snake grows, so head to (4,3), tail doesn't move, new segment added, so length increases.\n> \n> But let's think turn by turn.\n> \n> First, for turn 21, if I choose D to (5,3).\n> \n> Then turn 22, from (5,3), I can move L to (4,3) to eat food.\n> \n> (4,3) has value 1, positive, so I eat it, length +1.\n> \n> Then snake positions: head at (4,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — and tail (1,6) was not moved since we ate, but when we eat, we add a new segment, so the tail stays where it is.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new head position, and the body includes all previous positions plus the new head, so length increases.\n> \n> After move to food: head moves to food cell, food eaten, tail remains, so the body has one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, after turn 21 move to (5,3) no eat: positions as above, 9 segments? Original had 9 positions, after move without eat, still 9, but tail moved.\n> \n> Original: 9 segments.\n> \n> After move to (5,3) no eat: head new, body shifted, tail moved, still 9 segments.\n> \n> Then turn 22, move to (4,3) which is food, eat: head to (4,3), body: the previous head (5,3) becomes new segment 1, and so on, up to segment 9 at (2,6), and since eat, tail doesn't move, but we add a segment? No: the body consists of the previous positions. Since tail didn't move, the last segment stays, so we have one more segment.\n> \n> Previous state before move: head at (5,3), body segments from (5,4) to (2,6), 8 segments?

Let me confirm the movement directions.\n> \n> The problem says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So up increases y, down decreases y. So (5,3) with direction D means it was moving down to (5,2) next, but I need to choose an action for turn 22.\n> \n> Current head is at (5,3), direction D, so last move was down, so I came from above.

(4,3) is a food position! (4,3) has food with value 1.\n> \n> Now, is (4,3) occupied by body? Snake positions: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), etc. (4,4) is a body segment, (4,5) is body, but (4,3) is not listed, so it's free, except for food.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, so if I move left to (4,3), I eat the food.\n> \n> But is there any danger? Tail reward danger? Tail is at (2,6), not adjacent to head. Head at (5,3), tail at (2,6), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (5,3) to (2,6) is not adjacent; distance is |5-2|=3, |3-6|=3, so not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Also, (4,3) is not under snake body; it's free.\n> \n> Moving R (right): to (6,3). (6,3): is it wall? x=6, not 0 or 7, y=3, not 0 or 7, internal obstacle (5,6), not (6,3), so ok. Body collision: not in positions, so free.\n> \n> (6,3) has no food mentioned, so just empty cell.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting food, especially the one with short life span.\n> \n> (5,1) at (5,1), life span 4, so must eat soon.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), so to reach (5,1), I need to go down twice: to (5,2) then (5,1).\n> \n> But (5,1) might be under snake body or something? Snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), so (5,1) is not occupied, it's below.\n> \n> But there's a food at (5,1), and head at (5,3), so I can move down to (5,2), then next turn to (5,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But I need to check if (5,1) is under snake body. Food can spawn under body, but in this case, (5,1) is not in snake positions, so it's not under body.\n> \n> Snake positions: from (5,3) to (5,5) on x=5, y=3,4,5, then (4,5), etc. So (5,1) is free, no body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is food, which I can get by moving left now.\n> \n> (6,1) is food at (6,1), which is bottom-right.\n> \n> Since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, the grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls at borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake head at (5,3), moving down.\n> \n> I should aim to eat (5,1) soon because it disappears in 4 turns.\n> \n> If I move down to (5,2) now, turn 22, then on turn 23, I can move down to (5,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But when I eat (5,1), my length increases, so tail doesn't move, and I get +1.\n> \n> After that, I need to think where to go.\n> \n> There is also (4,3) which I could eat now by moving left.\n> \n> (4,3) has life span 7, so less urgent.\n> \n> (6,1) has life span 10, even less urgent.\n> \n> But if I go for (5,1) first, I might miss (4,3) if I don't go that way.\n> \n> (4,3) is at (4,3), which is left of current position.\n> \n> If I move down to (5,2) now, I can't get (4,3) immediately.\n> \n> But after eating (5,1), I can go left or right.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7) wall, (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (0,0) to (7,0) wall, (0,7) to (7,7) wall. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) to (6,6) should be playable, but y=0 is wall, y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6? But in food, we have (5,1), y=1, which is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable, similarly x=1 to x=6 playable, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> In the wall description: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (5,1): x=5 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0, so it's not a wall cell, it's playable. Similarly, (4,3), (6,1) all playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is not border, so it's a wall cell.\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,6) is wall.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake head (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)\n> \n> (3,6) is at y=6, which is border? y=6, but walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, it's playable. Similarly, x=6 is playable.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 playable. x=0 and x=7 walls, x=1 to 6 playable.\n> \n> (3,6) is fine.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> Option 1: Move down to (5,2) on turn 22.\n> \n> Then on turn 23, move down to (5,1) to eat the food. Length increases by 1, so snake becomes: head at (5,1), then body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — 10 segments? Original 9 segments, eat food, so head moves to (5,1), new segment added, so positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)]? Original list: head (5,3), then segments: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — that's 8 body segments, plus head, total 9 positions.\n> \n> Indices: position 0: head (5,3), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,6), 8: (2,6). So 9 segments.\n> \n> After moving down to (5,2) on turn 22: head to (5,2), tail moves, so tail (2,6) is removed, positions become: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] — since tail moved, (2,6) gone, and (5,2) new head, (5,3) now body, etc.\n> \n> Original: turn 22, before move, positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)]\n> \n> After move down: head moves to (5,2), so new head at (5,2), then the body segments shift: the segment that was at index 0 (old head) becomes body at (5,3), index 1 (5,4) to (5,4), etc., and the last segment (2,6) is removed since no food eaten. So new positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] — tail is now (3,6), since (2,6) removed.\n> \n> Then on turn 23, move down to (5,1): head to (5,1), and since (5,1) has food, we eat it, so tail does not move, new segment added. So positions: head at (5,1), then body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) — and since we eat, we add a new segment, so the body includes the previous positions without removing tail, so positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] — 10 segments, tail at (3,6).\n> \n> Now, head at (5,1), direction down.\n> \n> From here, I can move left, right, or down? Down to (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot move down. y=0 is wall, so from (5,1), moving down to (5,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,1): left to (4,1), right to (6,1), or up to (5,2).\n> \n> But up to (5,2) is where the body is, since body is at (5,2), which is the segment behind head.\n> \n> Head at (5,1), body: (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> If I move up to (5,2), that is occupied by the body, but (5,2) is the first body segment, which is the neck. Since tail is at (3,6), (5,2) is not tail, so moving to (5,2) would be body collision, die.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (4,1), or right to (6,1).\n> \n> (6,1) has food! (6,1) is a food position with value 1.\n> \n> So I can move right to (6,1) to eat it, but need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Move to (6,1): is it free? Snake positions: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) — no (6,1), so free. And it has food, so eating it would grow again.\n> \n> But life span of (6,1) is 10, so not urgent, but it's there.\n> \n> After eating (5,1), I can go to (6,1) next.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> If I go down to (5,2) on turn 22, then down to (5,1) on turn 23.\n> \n> On turn 23, after eating, head at (5,1), direction down.\n> \n> Then on turn 24, I can move right to (6,1) to eat that food?

After moving to (6,1), positions: head at (6,1), body: (5,1), (5,2), etc. So (5,1) is body, so moving left to (5,1) would be collision.\n> \n> Up to (6,2), or down to (6,0) invalid.\n> \n> So only up to (6,2) or... down invalid, left invalid, right invalid, so only up to (6,2).\n> \n> Then from (6,2), I can go left or up or right, etc.\n> \n> But this seems ok, but let's see other options.\n> \n> I could eat (4,3) now on turn 22 by moving left.\n> \n> Move L to (4,3) on turn 22.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, so eat it, grow.\n> \n> Then positions: head moves to (4,3), eat food, so new head at (4,3), body: the old head and body, but since eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)] — 10 segments, tail at (2,6).\n> \n> Head at (4,3), direction left (since moved left).\n> \n> From here, possible moves: since moved left, cannot move right (reverse).\n> \n> So can move left to (3,3), down to (4,2), up to (4,4).\n> \n> But (4,4) is body segment, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (3,3) is free?

It's turn 23, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,2), then body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1), but since direction is D, moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Head direction D means moving down, so from (5,2), moving down would go to (5,1), but let's confirm the coordinate system. Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but here, movement U is (x,y+1), which might be up if y=0 is bottom, but let's see the walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? U is (x,y+1), so moving up increases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Head at (5,2), direction D, which is (x,y-1), so moving down to lower y.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn?

After turn 23, life span becomes 2; after turn 24, it becomes 1; after turn 25, it becomes 0 and disappears?

Head at (5,2), tail at (3,6). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |dx| + |dy| =1.\n> \n> (5,2) to (3,6): dx=2, dy=4, not adjacent.

It's turn 24, and I'm the snake AI. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 24, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 25? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L. But since it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for food at (5,1), turn 24, life span 2, so countdown is 2 now. After turn 24, it decreases to 1, so it can be eaten on turn 24 or 25, and disappears after turn 25.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) with value 1, life span 5, so available until turn 28 (24+5-1=28? Let's calculate: at turn 24, life span 5, after turn 24, life span 4, ..., after turn 28, life span 0, so disappears after turn 28, meaning last chance to eat is turn 28. But it can be eaten on turns where life span >0.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is L at turn t, it exists for L turns including the current one, so it disappears at the start of turn t+L. So for (5,1): L=2 at t=24, so exists on turns 24 and 25, disappears at turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3): L=5 at t=24, exists on turns 24 to 28, disappears at turn 29.\n> \n> (6,1): L=8 at t=24, exists on turns 24 to 31, disappears at turn 32.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,2), direction L, so last move was left, to (4,2). Since direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn, but I can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - Up: (4,3) - but there's food at (4,3)? (4,3) is a food position, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). So (4,3) is not in snake body, so it's free? But there's food there.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, and it's not occupied by snake, so moving up to (4,3) would eat the food.\n> \n> But let's list all cells.\n> \n> First, snake segments:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> So the tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (5,1) - not occupied\n> \n> - (4,3) - not occupied\n> \n> - (6,1) - not occupied\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (5,1) is at y=1, which is not y=0, so it's playable. y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,3) - this has food, and it's empty except for food.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,1) - is this valid? (4,1) is within bounds? x=4, y=1, y=1 is not wall, so yes. But is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,2), (5,2), etc., no (4,1), so empty. But no food there.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,2) - x=3, y=2. Is it wall? No. Occupied? Snake has (3,4) and (3,5), not (3,2), so empty.\n> \n> - Right (R): but current direction is L, so moving right is opposite, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" so since head direction is L, I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 24: U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid from (1,1) to (6,6), but walls at borders, so cells (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6.\n> \n> Obstacle at (5,6), which is a wall, so cannot enter.\n> \n> Snake: positions in order: (4,2) head, then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> y=6: ... but (5,6) is obstacle, not part of grid.\n> \n> List rows from y=6 down to y=1 for easier visualization.\n> \n> y=6: cells (1,6) to (6,6).

No, since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the last segment remains, so tail is still (3,5), but now there are 10 segments.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head to (4,3), body: the previous segments all stay, but since head moved, the first body segment is now (4,2), which was head, and so on, up to tail (3,5). And because I ate, I don't remove the tail, so the tail stays, and length is 10.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, and you add a new segment at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it effectively grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the list becomes: new head at (4,3), then the entire previous list: (4,2), (5,2), ..., (3,5), so 10 positions.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,3), what is the head direction? Since I moved up, direction is now U.\n> \n> But is there any danger? (4,3) was empty except food, so no collision.

New head at (4,1), direction D. Then positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (5,2), etc., and tail (3,5) moves? Since no eat, tail moves off, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> After moving without eating: head moves to (4,1), then body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), and tail (3,5) is removed, so positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)] and direction down.\n> \n> Similarly, move Left to (3,2): no food, so head to (3,2), then body (4,2), (5,2), etc., tail removed, positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)] direction L.\n> \n> Now, back to thinking long-term.\n> \n> First, food at (5,1) has short life, only 2 turns including current, so if not eaten now or next turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) has longer life.\n> \n> But moving to (4,3) now seems good, but let's see the risks.\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), head at (4,3), which is surrounded: left (3,3), right (5,3), down (4,2), up (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is part of body, currently occupied.

It's turn 24, and I'm the snake AI. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 24, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 25? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L. But since it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for food at (5,1), turn 24, life span 2, so countdown is 2 now. After turn 24, it decreases to 1, so it can be eaten on turn 24 or 25, and disappears after turn 25.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) with value 1, life span 5, so available until turn 28 (24+5-1=28? Let's calculate: at turn 24, life span 5, after turn 24, life span 4, ..., after turn 28, life span 0, so disappears after turn 28, meaning last chance to eat is turn 28. But it can be eaten on turns where life span >0.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is L at turn t, it exists for L turns including the current one, so it disappears at the start of turn t+L. So for (5,1): L=2 at t=24, so exists on turns 24 and 25, disappears at turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3): L=5 at t=24, exists on turns 24 to 28, disappears at turn 29.\n> \n> (6,1): L=8 at t=24, exists on turns 24 to 31, disappears at turn 32.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,2), direction L, so last move was left, to (4,2). Since direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn, but I can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - Up: (4,3) - but there's food at (4,3)? (4,3) is a food position, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). So (4,3) is not in snake body, so it's free? But there's food there.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, and it's not occupied by snake, so moving up to (4,3) would eat the food.\n> \n> But let's list all cells.\n> \n> First, snake segments:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> So the tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (5,1) - not occupied\n> \n> - (4,3) - not occupied\n> \n> - (6,1) - not occupied\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (5,1) is at y=1, which is not y=0, so it's playable. y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,3) - this has food, and it's empty except for food.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,1) - is this valid? (4,1) is within bounds? x=4, y=1, y=1 is not wall, so yes. But is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,2), (5,2), etc., no (4,1), so empty. But no food there.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,2) - x=3, y=2. Is it wall? No. Occupied? Snake has (3,4) and (3,5), not (3,2), so empty.\n> \n> - Right (R): but current direction is L, so moving right is opposite, which is not allowed.

Positions are listed head first, so at turn 26, head is at (3,1), and it was at (4,1) before, so yes, moving left.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so no negative food here. That's good; I don't have to worry about penalties.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3), life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 29, it's gone. Similarly, (6,1) disappears after turn 31, and (2,5) after turn 34.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,1)\n> \n> Body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (3,1) head\n> \n> - (4,1) body\n> \n> - (4,2) body\n> \n> - (5,2) body\n> \n> - (5,3) body\n> \n> - (5,4) body\n> \n> - (5,5) body\n> \n> - (4,5) body\n> \n> - (4,4) body (tail)\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (4,3) – but (4,3) is not in the snake positions? Snake has (5,3), (5,4), etc., but not (4,3). Let me check.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4)\n> \n> So (4,3) is empty? But food is at (4,3), and it's on the grid.\n> \n> (4,3) is not occupied by snake; snake has (5,3) which is different.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) and (2,5) are also free.\n> \n> But (4,3) is a food cell. Now, is this under the snake's body? No, currently, snake is not on (4,3). Let's see the positions: (4,2) and (5,3) are adjacent, but (4,3) is free, I think.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> At y=3, we have (5,3) occupied, but (4,3) is not listed, so it should be free, with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is free, and (2,5) is free.\n> \n> But (4,3) has food with life span 4, meaning it will disappear in 4 turns, so by turn 29 if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,1), moving left, so direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. Therefore, I cannot move right on this turn.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,1): U (up to (3,2)), D (down to (3,0)), L (left to (2,1)), but not R to (4,1) because (4,1) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Let's see what cells are around (3,1):\n> \n> - Up: (3,2) – is this free? Snake positions: (3,1) head, (4,1) is body, (4,2) is body, no (3,2), so (3,2) should be free, but is it a wall? Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, but (3,2) is within bounds, x=3,y=2.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is fine.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (5,6), not affecting.\n> \n> So (3,2) is free.\n> \n> - Down: (3,0) – but y=0 is a wall, so cannot move down; it's a border wall.\n> \n> - Left: (2,1) – x=2,y=1, not border, no obstacle, and not occupied? Snake positions: head (3,1), body starts at (4,1), etc., no (2,1), so should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,1) – but (4,1) is occupied by the body, so cannot move there; collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move right because it's opposite direction, but even if not, it's occupied.\n> \n> So from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), L to (2,1), or D but D is wall, so only U or L.\n> \n> D is to (3,0), which is y=0, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only U or L possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,3): this is close to the snake. Current head at (3,1), (4,3) is two moves away if I go up then right, or something.\n> \n> Also, (4,3) has a life span of 4, so it will disappear after turn 29. Since current turn is 26, after 4 turns: turn 26,27,28,29; on turn 29 it disappears, meaning it can be eaten up to turn 28, I think? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 26, life span 4; after turn 26, it becomes 3; turn 27: 2; turn 28:1; turn 29:0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 26,27,28.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 6: disappears after turn 31.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 9: disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is at (4,3), which is adjacent to the snake's body? Let's see the snake: positions include (4,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n> \n> (4,3) is not occupied, but is it under the body? Currently, no body on (4,3), but food is there.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on.\"\n> \n> But here, (4,3) is not under the body; it's a free cell with food.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is close. But let's see if it's safe to go for it.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,4), and food is at (4,3), which is adjacent to tail? (4,3) and (4,4) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,3), not on the tail. Tail is at (4,4), no food on tail.\n> \n> The danger is when the food is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> Rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> So the food must be on the tail cell.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (4,4), and food is at (4,3), not on (4,4). So no issue.\n> \n> Now, to eat (4,3), I need to get the head to (4,3).\n> \n> From current position (3,1), I can go up to (3,2), then from there, I can go right to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by body? Snake has (4,2) as a body segment.\n> \n> At turn 26, positions: head (3,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), etc.\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied.\n> \n> If I move to (3,2) now, then on next turn, I can move to (4,2)? But (4,2) is body, and when I move, the snake moves, so the body also moves.\n> \n> I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> Let me denote the snake: segments S0 = head (3,1), S1 = (4,1), S2 = (4,2), S3 = (5,2), S4 = (5,3), S5 = (5,4), S6 = (5,5), S7 = (4,5), S8 = (4,4) tail.\n> \n> Length 9 segments.\n> \n> When I move, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail moves away.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, tail moves, so the cell where tail was becomes free.\n> \n> If I eat food, tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at tail, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Now, for food at (4,3): to eat it, head must be on (4,3) when we decide to move there.\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently free, but when I move, the snake might be there or not.\n> \n> Let's plan a path.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 26: from (3,1), can go U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n> \n> If I go U to (3,2), then head is at (3,2), and body follows: the new positions would be: head (3,2), then S1 was (4,1) but now it moves to where head was, (3,1), S2 moves to S1 old position (4,1), S3 to S2 (4,2), S4 to S3 (5,2), S5 to S4 (5,3), S6 to S5 (5,4), S7 to S6 (5,5), S8 to S7 (4,5), and tail S8 was (4,4), which is now free? Let's list new positions after move up to (3,2):\n> \n> - New head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Then segment that was S1 (4,1) moves to old head position (3,1)\n> \n> - S2 (4,2) moves to old S1 position (4,1)\n> \n> - S3 (5,2) moves to old S2 position (4,2)\n> \n> - S4 (5,3) moves to old S3 position (5,2)\n> \n> - S5 (5,4) moves to old S4 position (5,3)\n> \n> - S6 (5,5) moves to old S5 position (5,4)\n> \n> - S7 (4,5) moves to old S6 position (5,5)\n> \n> - S8 (4,4) moves to old S7 position (4,5)\n> \n> - Tail was S8, now moved to (4,5), so old tail position (4,4) is free.\n> \n> After moving up to (3,2), the snake positions are: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). Tail at (4,5).\n> \n> (4,4) is now free, but food is at (4,3), not (4,4).\n> \n> (4,3) is still free.\n> \n> From (3,2), I can move to (4,2) or (3,3) or (2,2), etc., but (4,2) is now occupied by the body?

Old segments: when head moves to (3,3), the first body segment is old head (3,2), then old (3,1), then old (4,1), ..., up to old (5,5), and the last body segment was (4,5), which is now the new tail position, but since no food eaten, tail moves, so the cell (4,5) is occupied, and old tail cell (4,5) is left, but it's the same, so (4,5) is still occupied.\n> \n> Positions after turn 27 move U: [ (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ] and (4,5) is gone?

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible moves step by step.\n\n### Current State (Turn 27):\n- **Snake Positions**: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] (head at (3,2), tail at (4,5))\n- **Head Direction**: U (up, meaning next move would be in the positive y-direction)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,3): value=1, life_span=3 (will disappear after turn 29)\n  - (6,1): value=1, life_span=5 (will disappear after turn 31)\n  - (2,5): value=1, life_span=8 (will disappear after turn 34)\n\n### Possible Moves from (3,2):\nFrom the current head position (3,2), the possible moves are:\n1. **U (Up)**: to (3,3)\n   - (3,3) is not occupied by the snake or walls. Safe.\n2. **D (Down)**: to (3,1)\n   - (3,1) is the second segment of the snake. Collision with body. Deadly. Cannot move D.\n3. **L (Left)**: to (2,2)\n   - (2,2) is not occupied by the snake or walls. Safe.\n4. **R (Right)**: to (4,2)\n   - (4,2) is the fourth segment of the snake. Collision with body. Deadly. Cannot move R.\n\nSo, the possible safe moves are **U** and **L**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move U to (3,3)**:\n   - Next turn (turn 28), from (3,3), can move R to (4,3) to eat the food (life_span=3 at turn 27, so can eat on turn 28).\n   - After eating, the snake grows to 10 segments. Then must move U to (4,4) on turn 29 (other moves lead to body collisions).\n   - This path allows eating the food at (4,3) and then potentially moving towards (2,5).\n\n2. **Move L to (2,2)**:\n   - From (2,2), cannot reach (4,3) in time to eat it before it disappears (would require being at (3,3) or (4,2) by turn 29, which is not feasible from (2,2)).\n   - Thus, moving L would miss the food at (4,3).\n   - However, moving L opens up space on the left side and allows heading towards (2,5) directly.\n\n### Decision:\nThe food at (4,3) is only available for a short time (until turn 29), and moving U allows us to eat it on turn 28. Missing this food would mean losing a potential point. While moving L opens up space, the immediate opportunity to score by eating (4,3) is more valuable.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nChoose to move **U** to (3,3) on turn 27 to set up eating (4,3) on turn 28.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

Typically in grids, y increases upwards, so U would be to (x, y+1). But let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards.

Walls: borders, so (2,2) is x=2,y=2, within 1 to 6? Grid from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So cells with x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6 are free, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,6), which is within bounds.\n> \n> (2,2): x=2, y=2, not border, not (5,6), so free. Snake not there, so L to (2,2) is possible.\n> \n> - R: to (4,2). Now (4,2) is the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), so (4,2) is the fourth segment. Moving to (4,2) would be head colliding with body at (4,2), which is not the tail. The tail is at (4,5). Since it's not the tail, it's a body collision, deadly. So cannot move R.\n> \n> Cannot move D or R because of body collision.\n> \n> Can move U or L.\n> \n> U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, so if I move L, that's left, which is not opposite to U?

The description says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the start of turn t, if food has life_span N, it will be there for this turn and the next N-1 turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: if life_span is N at turn t, it means it has N turns left, including the current turn. So after being present for N turns, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only on this turn.\n> \n> If N=2, it is present this turn and next turn, then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, here food at (4,3) life_span=3 at turn 27, so it will be present on turns 27, 28, 29, and disappear after turn 29? Turn 27: life_span=3, after turn 27, it becomes 2, then after turn 28, it becomes 1, after turn 29, it becomes 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 30.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life_span=5, present from turn 27 to 31?

Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7):\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Internal obstacle at (5,6)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly vertical with a bend. From (3,3) down to (3,1), then right to (4,1), up to (4,2), right to (5,2), up to (5,3), up to (5,4), up to (5,5). (5,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Head is at (3,3), direction Up, so it came from (3,2) and is moving towards (3,4) if it goes Up.\n> \n> Available moves from current position (3,3):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,4)\n> \n> - Down: to (3,2) but (3,2) is part of the body, and since the snake is moving, the tail will move, but let's see the body positions.\n> \n> After moving, the body will shift. When the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Here, if no food eaten, the tail at (5,5) will be removed, and the new tail will be (5,4) or something? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions in order: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> If head moves to a new position, say to (x,y), then the new snake positions will be: head at (x,y), then the previous head (3,3) becomes segment 1, (3,2) becomes segment 2, ..., up to segment 7: (5,4), and segment 8 (tail) is removed, so the new tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if food is eaten, the tail is not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,2) – but (3,2) is currently occupied by segment 1. However, since the snake will move, after moving, segment 1 will move to where head was or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that it can move into the cell that was the tail, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,3), moving Down to (3,2): (3,2) is currently occupied by segment 1. After movement, if head moves to (3,2), but segment 1 was at (3,2), which will move to (3,3) since head was there? Let's simulate.\n> \n> If head moves Down to (3,2):\n> \n> - New head position: (3,2)\n> \n> - Then the body: segment 1 (was at (3,2)) moves to where head was, (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (3,1)) moves to where segment 1 was, (3,2)? No.\n> \n> Positions after move:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell: (3,2)\n> \n> - Then each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Segment 1 (index 1, was (3,2)) moves to the previous position of head, which is (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (index 2, was (3,1)) moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (index 3, was (4,1)) moves to previous position of segment 2, which was (3,1)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,2), the new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,3)  (previous head position)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,2) but that was where head moved to? Conflict.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment closer to head.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - The segment that was at position i moves to position i-1, for i from 1 to len-1.\n> \n> - Head is at new position.\n> \n> - If no food eaten, the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So for snake: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P8 (tail)\n> \n> If head moves to new cell N:\n> \n> - New head: N\n> \n> - New segment 1: P0 (old head position)\n> \n> - New segment 2: P1\n> \n> - New segment 3: P2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment 8: P7\n> \n> - And P8 is removed (tail)\n> \n> So the new snake is: N, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7\n> \n> Old positions: P0=(3,3), P1=(3,2), P2=(3,1), P3=(4,1), P4=(4,2), P5=(5,2), P6=(5,3), P7=(5,4), P8=(5,5)\n> \n> If head moves to (3,2):\n> \n> N = (3,2)\n> \n> New head: (3,2)\n> \n> New seg1: P0 = (3,3)\n> \n> New seg2: P1 = (3,2)  -- but (3,2) is N, so new seg2 is (3,2), but head is also at (3,2)?

Collision.\n> \n> Yes, so moving to a body segment that is not the tail causes collision because that segment hasn't moved away yet.\n> \n> But for the tail, it moves away, so it's safe.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is not the tail; it's P1, which will become seg1 at (3,3), but at the moment of move, if head moves to (3,2), it is occupied by P1, so collision.\n> \n> The rule: \"head touches any body segment\" at the time of move.\n> \n> So from (3,3), moving to (3,2) would touch the body segment at (3,2), which is not the tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Left to (2,3): is that occupied? Current positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (2,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but need to check walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,3) is within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, so (2,3) is valid, no wall or obstacle mentioned except (5,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: only (5,6), so (2,3) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, Right to (4,3): (4,3) is not in snake positions, and not wall.\n> \n> Up to (3,4): not in positions, not wall.\n> \n> Down to (3,2): occupied by body, not safe.\n> \n> Also, current head direction is Up, so I cannot move Down on the next turn because of \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R (since D is reverse and also occupied).\n> \n> So from (3,3), with direction U:\n> \n> - U: to (3,4)\n> \n> - L: to (2,3)\n> \n> - R: to (4,3)\n> \n> D is invalid because reverse and occupied.\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are safe.\n> \n> (3,4): is it occupied?

Since life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 28, life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,3), life span 2 at turn 28, so after this turn (turn 28), life span becomes 1, and after turn 29, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 28 or 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 4, so after turn 28, 3 left; (2,5) life span 7, 6 left after turn 28; (6,4) life span 10, 9 left.\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is very close to head, at (3,3), adjacent right.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,3), I can eat it immediately.\n> \n> But is it safe?

Valid.\n  - **Down (D)**: (4,2) - Occupied by body segment (4,2). Invalid (collision).\n  - **Left (L)**: (3,3) - Occupied by body segment (3,3). Invalid (collision).\n  - **Right (R)**: (5,3) - Occupied by body segment (5,3). Invalid (collision).\n\n### Immediate Observation:\n- The only valid move is **Up (U)** to (4,4). All other directions lead to immediate collisions with the snake's body.\n\n### Food Analysis:\n- **(6,1)**: Life span 3 (available until turn 31). Too far to reach in time from current position.\n- **(2,5)**: Life span 6 (available until turn 34). Could be a target after moving up.\n- **(6,4)**: Life span 9 (available until turn 37). Could be a target after moving up.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Turn 29**: Move **U** to (4,4).

No.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position remains and a new tail is created there.\n> \n> Standard: the snake moves forward, head to new position, each segment to next, but if food eaten, instead of removing tail, we keep the tail and add a new segment at the end, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: after move to food, head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes the first body segment, and so on, up to the tail, which remains, and since we add a segment, the new tail is the old tail position, but we add a segment, so the segment that was tail is now the second last, and new tail is added at the same position? No.\n> \n> Let's think.\n> \n> Before move: positions: let S = [body segments] with head at S[0], tail at S[-1]\n> \n> Move to new cell C.\n> \n> If C not food, new head at C, new body S[0] to S[-2], tail at S[-1] is removed, so new positions: [C, S[0], S[1], ..., S[-2]]\n> \n> If C is food, new head at C, new body S[0] to S[-1], and add new segment at S[-1], so new positions: [C, S[0], S[1], ..., S[-1]]\n> \n> That is, the tail stays, and we add a copy or something, but the cell S[-1] is occupied twice? No, the new segment is added at the current tail position, but since the tail moves only if not eating, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> In terms of cells: after eating, the head is at C (food cell), the body includes all previous positions, and the tail is still at the old tail position, so the cell is the same, but now it's the penultimate segment, and the new tail is also at that cell? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, so the segment that was at S[0] moves to C, but no.\n> \n> Better: the snake moves: head moves to new cell C.\n> \n> Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail is not removed; it stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it stays, so effectively, the snake extends at the tail.\n> \n> So positions: new head at C, then S[0] (old head), S[1], ..., S[-1] (old tail), and S[-1] is still the tail position, but now it has a segment, and since we add a segment, the new tail is S[-1], and we add a new segment at S[-1], but that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think it's simpler: after moving to food, the snake has one more segment; the head is at the new position, and the tail remains where it was (so the tail cell doesn't change), and all segments in between shift.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P9 (tail)\n> \n> Move to C with food eaten.\n> \n> New positions: C (new head), P0, P1, P2, ..., P9 (new tail)\n> \n> P9 is still the tail, and the snake has 11 segments.\n> \n> The cell P9 is occupied, and no new cell added; the tail stays put.\n> \n> In terms of grid, the tail cell remains occupied, and head moves to C.\n> \n> If no food, new positions: C, P0, P1, ..., P8; P9 vacated.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 31 move to (6,4) with food.\n> \n> After turn 30: positions head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), tail (5,3)\n> \n> Move to (6,4) with food eaten.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)  // tail at (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is still tail.\n> \n> Snake length 11.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), direction R.\n> \n> Now, from here, we can plan next moves.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Since we ate food, we have more body, which might block paths.\n> \n> But for now.\n> \n> Another option on turn 30: move U to (4,5)\n> \n> Then head at (4,5), direction U.\n> \n> Then turn 31, from (4,5), can move U to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n> \n> (4,6) is top row, y=6.\n> \n> (3,5) free.\n> \n> (5,5) free.\n> \n> Then from there, we can go to (2,5) or other.\n> \n> But (6,4) is still available, but farther.\n> \n> Similarly, if move L to (3,4) on turn 30, then to (2,5) might be closer.\n> \n> But let's see which is better for long-term.\n> \n> Also, there is the obstacle at (5,6), which might affect moves near top.\n> \n> But y=6 is playable.\n> \n> Now, back to the sequence with eating (6,4).\n> \n> After eating at (6,4) on turn 31, head at (6,4), direction R.\n> \n> Now possible moves: U, D, L (not R, since reverse not allowed, direction R, cannot move L left).\n> \n> Opposite of R is L, so cannot move L.\n> \n> Possible: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), R but R to (7,4) is x=7, wall, not possible.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n> \n> So only U or D.\n> \n> U to (6,5), D to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, (6,5): is it free?

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible moves step-by-step to determine the best immediate action at turn \\( t_0 = 33 \\).\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (4,5), body segments follow: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] (tail at (4,2)).\n- **Head Direction**: Left (L).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 35).\n  - (6,4): value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 37).\n  - (6,5): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 40).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,5):\nCurrent direction is L, so we cannot move R (instant reverse). Possible moves:\n1. **Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) is empty and not a wall. Safe.\n2. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - (4,6) is empty and not a wall. Safe.\n3. **Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body (segment 3). Deadly collision. Invalid.\n\nThus, valid moves: **L to (3,5)** or **U to (4,6)**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Option 1: Move L to (3,5)\n- **Immediate**: Moves head to (3,5), direction becomes L.\n- **Next Turn (34)**: From (3,5), can move L to (2,5) to eat food (life span 3, must eat by turn 35). \n  - Eating (2,5) grows snake to length 11, but may trap the snake in the corner (as seen in the earlier analysis).\n- **Alternative**: From (3,5), avoid eating (2,5) and move U to (3,6) or D to (3,4). \n  - Moving U to (3,6) may lead to dead ends later.\n  - Moving D to (3,4) risks getting stuck (e.g., at (3,4) with no exits).\n\n#### Option 2: Move U to (4,6)\n- **Immediate**: Moves head to (4,6), direction becomes U.\n- **Next Turn (34)**: From (4,6), only safe move is L to (3,6) (since U is wall, D is body, R is obstacle).\n- **Turn 35**: From (3,6), can move D to (3,5) to potentially eat (2,5) on turn 35 (last chance). \n  - Eating (2,5) may still lead to trapping the snake.\n- **Alternative**: From (3,6), avoid (2,5) and move to (2,6), but this delays reaching the right-side food.\n\n### Risk of Eating (2,5):\nEating (2,5) grows the snake but risks trapping it in the top-left corner due to the long body. The snake may not have enough space to maneuver afterward, leading to inevitable collision. \n\n### Alternative Strategy:\nAvoid eating (2,5) and prioritize reaching the right-side food (6,4) and (6,5), which have longer life spans. This requires moving rightward early, but the current head direction (L) restricts immediate rightward movement.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\nGiven the risks of trapping the snake by eating (2,5), the safer choice is to **move U to (4,6)** at turn 33. This avoids the immediate danger of trapping and keeps the snake more centralized, allowing future flexibility to navigate toward the right-side food. \n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 33 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (2, 5, 3, 1)\n\t- (6, 4, 5, 1)\n\t- (6, 5, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 33 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 33, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), then body segments: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). So the snake is 10 cells long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (4,5) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and previous head was at (5,5) before moving left to (4,5), so current direction is L.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (2,5) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 33, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 35? Let's clarify: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t + N, it's gone. But since it decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span is N, at t+1 it's N-1, ..., at t+N-1 it's 1, and at t+N it's gone. So for (2,5), at turn 33, life span 3, so it will be there on turns 33, 34, 35, and gone on turn 36.\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 5.

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence for the next 5+ turns, starting from turn 33. The action is for the head movement: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5), direction L. So possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, meaning I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R. So possible moves from (4,5): L to (3,5), U to (4,6), or D to (4,4).\n> \n> But (4,4) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see the snake positions: (4,5) head, (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), ... so (4,4) is the fourth segment, which is part of the body. Moving to (4,4) would cause a collision because head touches body segment. Rule: body collision is deadly, except for the tail, but only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment only if the tail is moving away. But in this case, (4,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,2). Let's list snake positions in order: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2)? Positions: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (4,2). So tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Now, (4,4) is occupied by the body at position 3. If I move down to (4,4), that's a body collision, death. Similarly, moving left to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) are body, but (3,5) is not listed, so it should be empty. Similarly, up to (4,6): not listed, should be empty. Down to (4,4) is occupied.\n> \n> Also, walls: border walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is y=6, which is within 0 to 7, so not wall. (3,5) similarly. (4,4) is inside but occupied by snake.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), but we're not moving there yet.\n> \n> So from (4,5), possible safe moves:\n> \n> - Left to (3,5): empty? Grid is 8x8, x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive? Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7). So (3,5) is x=3>0, y=5<7, so not wall. And not occupied by snake, so safe.\n> \n> - Up to (4,6): x=4, y=6<7, not wall, not snake, so safe.\n> \n> - Down to (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by snake body at index 3, so collision, not safe.\n> \n> Therefore, only two possible moves: L to (3,5) or U to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,5) value 1, life span 3: must be eaten by turn 35 at latest (since disappears after turn 35, so eaten on turn 35 or earlier).\n> \n> - (6,4) value 1, life span 5: eaten by turn 37.\n> \n> - (6,5) value 1, life span 8: eaten by turn 40.\n> \n> Also, the grid has walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

From (4,5) to (5,5) right, then down to (5,4), then left to (4,4), down to (4,3)? (4,4) to (4,3) is down? y decreases down? In coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases up, decreases down. So (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) so y+1 is up, so higher y is north, lower y is south.

Snake becomes: head (3,5), then old head (4,5) becomes body, and tail moves away from (4,2)? After move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> After moving left to (3,5), the snake positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head (4,5) becomes the first body segment, then (5,5) second, (5,4) third, (4,4) fourth, (4,3) fifth, (3,3) sixth, (3,2) seventh, (3,1) eighth, (4,1) ninth, and tail was (4,2), but since head moved, the tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it. The segment at (4,1) was connected to (4,2)? Positions: index 8: (4,1), index 9: (4,2). After head moves to (3,5), the body segments shift: segment 1 (old index 1) moves to old head position (4,5), segment 2 (old index 2) moves to old position of segment 1, which is (5,5), and so on, down to segment 9 (old index 9) moves to old position of segment 8, which is (4,1). So new tail is at (4,1), since segment 9 is now at (4,1), and segment 8 is at where segment 7 was, etc.\n> \n> Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Body 1: previous head (4,5)\n> \n> - Body 2: (5,5)  // old body 1\n> \n> - Body 3: (5,4)  // old body 2\n> \n> - Body 4: (4,4)  // old body 3\n> \n> - Body 5: (4,3)  // old body 4\n> \n> - Body 6: (3,3)  // old body 5\n> \n> - Body 7: (3,2)  // old body 6\n> \n> - Body 8: (3,1)  // old body 7\n> \n> - Body 9: (4,1)  // old body 8\n> \n> - Tail: (4,2) is gone? Old tail was (4,2), which was index 9. After move, the tail is the last segment, which is now at the position that was previously occupied by the second-to-last segment. Since the snake moves forward, the tail is removed from (4,2) and a new segment is not added unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, snake length same, so after moving to (3,5), the head is at (3,5), and the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed. So the new positions are: head (3,5), then the first 9 segments of the old positions, but shifted: actually, the segment that was at index 0 moves to new head, index 1 moves to old index 0, index 2 to old index 1, ..., index 9 to old index 8.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (4,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5), new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - New body 1: old head (4,5)  // position that was index 0\n> \n> - New body 2: old body 1 (5,5)  // position index 1\n> \n> - New body 3: old body 2 (5,4)  // index 2\n> \n> - New body 4: old body 3 (4,4)  // index 3\n> \n> - New body 5: old body 4 (4,3)  // index 4\n> \n> - New body 6: old body 5 (3,3)  // index 5\n> \n> - New body 7: old body 6 (3,2)  // index 6\n> \n> - New body 8: old body 7 (3,1)  // index 7\n> \n> - New body 9: old body 8 (4,1)  // index 8\n> \n> And the old tail (index 9: (4,2)) is no longer part of snake; it's vacated.\n> \n> So tail is now at (4,1), which was old body 8.\n> \n> Now, at (3,5), is there food? Food at (2,5) is nearby, which is (x=2,y=5), so (3,5) to (2,5) is left, adjacent.\n> \n> But we didn't eat food yet, just moved.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) but (4,5) is now occupied by body, and also R might be reverse? Current direction after moving L to (3,5) is L, so moving R would be reverse, not allowed. Direction: since we moved left to (3,5), new direction is L.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4). R to (4,5) not allowed and occupied.\n> \n> (2,5) has food, value 1. If we move L to (2,5), we eat the food.\n> \n> Eating food: if head moves to food cell, and it's not tail with danger, but (2,5) is not tail, so we eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; we need to think sequence.\n> \n> First, back to turn 33 decision.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (3,5) on turn 33.\n> \n> Then from there, we can go to (2,5) to eat food, but let's see life span: food at (2,5) life span 3, turn 33, so it will be there until turn 35.\n> \n> After moving to (3,5) on turn 33, on turn 34 we can move to (2,5) to eat it.\n> \n> But is it safe? From (3,5), moving to (2,5): (2,5) is not wall, not occupied? After turn 33 move, snake positions include (3,5), (4,5), etc., but (2,5) is empty, so yes, can move there.\n> \n> Then eating at (2,5) on turn 34.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new tail added, positions: head at (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail at old tail position? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n> \n> After moving to food, head is on food, so we add a new segment at the tail end, so the tail stays in place, and we add a new segment there? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position doesn't change immediately; the new segment is added, but the tail only moves when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the new head is at the food, and the tail remains where it was, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, in this case, if on turn 34, head moves from (3,5) to (2,5) and eats, then new positions: head (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail still (4,1)? No, after growth, the tail is the same as before, but since a new segment is added, the tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Normally, when moving without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, but no vacating; instead, the tail stays, and a new segment is effectively added. So the positions: head at new position, then the previous positions of all segments including the old tail.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (3,5) on turn 33 without eating, snake has positions from (3,5) to (4,1) as above, length 10, tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Then on turn 34, move to (2,5) and eat food. So new head at (2,5), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // this is the old tail, now part of body, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so tail is still at (4,1), but now it's the 10th segment, and we add an 11th segment at (4,1)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, the snake has one more segment. So positions: the new head is at the food cell, the first body segment is the old head position, and so on, down to the old tail position, and since we ate, the old tail position remains occupied, and no cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, before move: head at A, body B, C, ..., T tail.\n> \n> After moving to food: head at new position F, body1 at A, body2 at B, ..., bodyN at T, and since ate, tail is still at T, but now it's bodyN, and we have a new segment added, so the tail becomes T, and the new segment is added after, but since T was the tail, it stays, and the snake extends.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: after eating, the tail does not move; it stays in place for that turn, so the new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> In terms of positions list: after eating, the positions include the new head and all old positions, so the tail cell is the same as before eating.\n> \n> Then on subsequent moves, it moves normally.\n> \n> In this case: after turn 33, snake at: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // tail at (4,1)\n> \n> Turn 34: move to (2,5) and eat food. So new positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // all old positions plus new head, so tail still at (4,1), but now it's the 10th segment, and since we ate, the snake has 11 segments, but the positions are 11 cells: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Then on next move, tail will move if no eat.\n> \n> But back to decision.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move up to (4,6) on turn 33.\n> \n> But let's first consider the L option.\n> \n> If we go to (3,5) on turn 33, then we can go to (2,5) on turn 34 to eat the food. (2,5) has life span 3, so on turn 34 it's still there (since turn 33,34,35 it exists).\n> \n> Then we eat it, snake grows to 11.\n> \n> After that, we are at (2,5), with direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> From (2,5), possible moves: L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, and R is reverse if current direction L, so not allowed.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible: L, U, D.\n> \n> (1,5): x=1,y=5, not wall, not occupied? After eating, positions include (3,5) but not (1,5) or (2,6) or (2,4), so all empty, so safe.\n> \n> But we need to think further for other food and survival.\n> \n> There is food at (6,4) and (6,5), which are on the right side.\n> \n> Also, the snake is currently on the left, so we need to navigate to the right without dying.\n> \n> Another option: move up to (4,6) on turn 33.\n> \n> From (4,5), move U to (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) is not wall, not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> Then new head at (4,6), direction U.\n> \n> Snake positions after turn 33: head (4,6), body1 (4,5), body2 (5,5), body3 (5,4), body4 (4,4), body5 (4,3), body6 (3,3), body7 (3,2), body8 (3,1), body9 (4,1), tail (4,2)?

Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (4,5) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and previous head was at (5,5) before moving left to (4,5), so current direction is L.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (2,5) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 33, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 35? Let's clarify: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t + N, it's gone. But since it decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span is N, at t+1 it's N-1, ..., at t+N-1 it's 1, and at t+N it's gone. So for (2,5), at turn 33, life span 3, so it will be there on turns 33, 34, 35, and gone on turn 36.\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 5.

So possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, meaning I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R. So possible moves from (4,5): L to (3,5), U to (4,6), or D to (4,4).\n> \n> But (4,4) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see the snake positions: (4,5) head, (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), ... so (4,4) is the fourth segment, which is part of the body. Moving to (4,4) would cause a collision because head touches body segment. Rule: body collision is deadly, except for the tail, but only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment only if the tail is moving away. But in this case, (4,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,2). Let's list snake positions in order: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2)? Positions: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (4,2). So tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Now, (4,4) is occupied by the body at position 3. If I move down to (4,4), that's a body collision, death. Similarly, moving left to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) are body, but (3,5) is not listed, so it should be empty. Similarly, up to (4,6): not listed, should be empty. Down to (4,4) is occupied.\n> \n> Also, walls: border walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is y=6, which is within 0 to 7, so not wall. (3,5) similarly. (4,4) is inside but occupied by snake.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), but we're not moving there yet.\n> \n> So from (4,5), possible safe moves:\n> \n> - Left to (3,5): empty? Grid is 8x8, x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive? Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7). So (3,5) is x=3>0, y=5<7, so not wall. And not occupied by snake, so safe.\n> \n> - Up to (4,6): x=4, y=6<7, not wall, not snake, so safe.\n> \n> - Down to (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by snake body at index 3, so collision, not safe.\n> \n> Therefore, only two possible moves: L to (3,5) or U to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,5) value 1, life span 3: must be eaten by turn 35 at latest (since disappears after turn 35, so eaten on turn 35 or earlier).\n> \n> - (6,4) value 1, life span 5: eaten by turn 37.\n> \n> - (6,5) value 1, life span 8: eaten by turn 40.\n> \n> Also, the grid has walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders and internal at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2).\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around. From (4,5) to (5,5) right, then down to (5,4), then left to (4,4), down to (4,3)? (4,4) to (4,3) is down? y decreases down? In coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases up, decreases down. So (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) so y+1 is up, so higher y is north, lower y is south. So y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So snake positions:\n> \n> - Head (4,5) - let's say row 5, column 4? Better to think coordinates.\n> \n> (4,5): x=4, y=5\n> \n> (5,5): x=5, y=5\n> \n> (5,4): x=5, y=4\n> \n> (4,4): x=4, y=4\n> \n> (4,3): x=4, y=3\n> \n> (3,3): x=3, y=3\n> \n> (3,2): x=3, y=2\n> \n> (3,1): x=3, y=1\n> \n> (4,1): x=4, y=1\n> \n> (4,2): x=4, y=2  // tail\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2), but after head moves, tail moves, etc.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> (2,5) - x=2,y=5\n> \n> (6,4) - x=6,y=4\n> \n> (6,5) - x=6,y=5\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6) - so cannot go there.\n> \n> Current possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - L to (3,5)\n> \n> - U to (4,6)\n> \n> D to (4,4) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> R to (5,5) is instant reverse? Current direction L, moving R would be opposite, not allowed, and also (5,5) is occupied by body.\n> \n> So only L or U.\n> \n> Now, let's consider each option and plan ahead.\n> \n> First, if I move left to (3,5):\n> \n> Then new head position (3,5). Snake becomes: head (3,5), then old head (4,5) becomes body, and tail moves away from (4,2)? After move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> After moving left to (3,5), the snake positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head (4,5) becomes the first body segment, then (5,5) second, (5,4) third, (4,4) fourth, (4,3) fifth, (3,3) sixth, (3,2) seventh, (3,1) eighth, (4,1) ninth, and tail was (4,2), but since head moved, the tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it. The segment at (4,1) was connected to (4,2)? Positions: index 8: (4,1), index 9: (4,2). After head moves to (3,5), the body segments shift: segment 1 (old index 1) moves to old head position (4,5), segment 2 (old index 2) moves to old position of segment 1, which is (5,5), and so on, down to segment 9 (old index 9) moves to old position of segment 8, which is (4,1). So new tail is at (4,1), since segment 9 is now at (4,1), and segment 8 is at where segment 7 was, etc.\n> \n> Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Body 1: previous head (4,5)\n> \n> - Body 2: (5,5)  // old body 1\n> \n> - Body 3: (5,4)  // old body 2\n> \n> - Body 4: (4,4)  // old body 3\n> \n> - Body 5: (4,3)  // old body 4\n> \n> - Body 6: (3,3)  // old body 5\n> \n> - Body 7: (3,2)  // old body 6\n> \n> - Body 8: (3,1)  // old body 7\n> \n> - Body 9: (4,1)  // old body 8\n> \n> - Tail: (4,2) is gone? Old tail was (4,2), which was index 9. After move, the tail is the last segment, which is now at the position that was previously occupied by the second-to-last segment. Since the snake moves forward, the tail is removed from (4,2) and a new segment is not added unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, snake length same, so after moving to (3,5), the head is at (3,5), and the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed. So the new positions are: head (3,5), then the first 9 segments of the old positions, but shifted: actually, the segment that was at index 0 moves to new head, index 1 moves to old index 0, index 2 to old index 1, ..., index 9 to old index 8.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (4,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5), new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - New body 1: old head (4,5)  // position that was index 0\n> \n> - New body 2: old body 1 (5,5)  // position index 1\n> \n> - New body 3: old body 2 (5,4)  // index 2\n> \n> - New body 4: old body 3 (4,4)  // index 3\n> \n> - New body 5: old body 4 (4,3)  // index 4\n> \n> - New body 6: old body 5 (3,3)  // index 5\n> \n> - New body 7: old body 6 (3,2)  // index 6\n> \n> - New body 8: old body 7 (3,1)  // index 7\n> \n> - New body 9: old body 8 (4,1)  // index 8\n> \n> And the old tail (index 9: (4,2)) is no longer part of snake; it's vacated.\n> \n> So tail is now at (4,1), which was old body 8.\n> \n> Now, at (3,5), is there food? Food at (2,5) is nearby, which is (x=2,y=5), so (3,5) to (2,5) is left, adjacent.\n> \n> But we didn't eat food yet, just moved.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) but (4,5) is now occupied by body, and also R might be reverse? Current direction after moving L to (3,5) is L, so moving R would be reverse, not allowed. Direction: since we moved left to (3,5), new direction is L.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4). R to (4,5) not allowed and occupied.\n> \n> (2,5) has food, value 1. If we move L to (2,5), we eat the food.\n> \n> Eating food: if head moves to food cell, and it's not tail with danger, but (2,5) is not tail, so we eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; we need to think sequence.\n> \n> First, back to turn 33 decision.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (3,5) on turn 33.\n> \n> Then from there, we can go to (2,5) to eat food, but let's see life span: food at (2,5) life span 3, turn 33, so it will be there until turn 35.\n> \n> After moving to (3,5) on turn 33, on turn 34 we can move to (2,5) to eat it.\n> \n> But is it safe? From (3,5), moving to (2,5): (2,5) is not wall, not occupied? After turn 33 move, snake positions include (3,5), (4,5), etc., but (2,5) is empty, so yes, can move there.\n> \n> Then eating at (2,5) on turn 34.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new tail added, positions: head at (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail at old tail position? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n> \n> After moving to food, head is on food, so we add a new segment at the tail end, so the tail stays in place, and we add a new segment there? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position doesn't change immediately; the new segment is added, but the tail only moves when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the new head is at the food, and the tail remains where it was, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, in this case, if on turn 34, head moves from (3,5) to (2,5) and eats, then new positions: head (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail still (4,1)? No, after growth, the tail is the same as before, but since a new segment is added, the tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Normally, when moving without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, but no vacating; instead, the tail stays, and a new segment is effectively added. So the positions: head at new position, then the previous positions of all segments including the old tail.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (3,5) on turn 33 without eating, snake has positions from (3,5) to (4,1) as above, length 10, tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Then on turn 34, move to (2,5) and eat food. So new head at (2,5), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // this is the old tail, now part of body, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so tail is still at (4,1), but now it's the 10th segment, and we add an 11th segment at (4,1)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, the snake has one more segment. So positions: the new head is at the food cell, the first body segment is the old head position, and so on, down to the old tail position, and since we ate, the old tail position remains occupied, and no cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, before move: head at A, body B, C, ..., T tail.\n> \n> After moving to food: head at new position F, body1 at A, body2 at B, ..., bodyN at T, and since ate, tail is still at T, but now it's bodyN, and we have a new segment added, so the tail becomes T, and the new segment is added after, but since T was the tail, it stays, and the snake extends.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: after eating, the tail does not move; it stays in place for that turn, so the new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> In terms of positions list: after eating, the positions include the new head and all old positions, so the tail cell is the same as before eating.\n> \n> Then on subsequent moves, it moves normally.\n> \n> In this case: after turn 33, snake at: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // tail at (4,1)\n> \n> Turn 34: move to (2,5) and eat food. So new positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // all old positions plus new head, so tail still at (4,1), but now it's the 10th segment, and since we ate, the snake has 11 segments, but the positions are 11 cells: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Then on next move, tail will move if no eat.\n> \n> But back to decision.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move up to (4,6) on turn 33.\n> \n> But let's first consider the L option.\n> \n> If we go to (3,5) on turn 33, then we can go to (2,5) on turn 34 to eat the food. (2,5) has life span 3, so on turn 34 it's still there (since turn 33,34,35 it exists).\n> \n> Then we eat it, snake grows to 11.\n> \n> After that, we are at (2,5), with direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> From (2,5), possible moves: L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, and R is reverse if current direction L, so not allowed.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible: L, U, D.\n> \n> (1,5): x=1,y=5, not wall, not occupied?

estimate: turn 35 at (1,5), then to (2,5) but occupied, so need to go around.\n> \n> From (1,5), move D to (1,4) on turn 36.\n> \n> Then from (1,4), move R to (2,4) on turn 37, etc. But (2,4) might be occupied or not, depending on previous.\n> \n> It's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better not to eat the (2,5) food if it leads to dead end or missing other food.\n> \n> But (2,5) is close and will

(2,5), and (2,5) disappears.\n> \n> So to eat (2,5), we need to be at (3,5) or (2,6) or (2,4) on turn 35 and move to (2,5), but from (2,6) to (2,5) is down, from (2,4) to (2,5) is up, from (3,5) to (2,5) is left.\n> \n> But in the U first option, on turn 35 we are at (3,6) or (3,5) depending on choice.\n> \n> If on turn 35 at (3,5), we can eat (2,5) by moving left.\n> \n> If at (3,6), we can move down to (3,5) on turn 35, but then not at (2,5), so on turn 36 it's gone.\n> \n> So only if we are at (3,5) on turn 35, we can eat it on that turn.\n> \n> In the U first path: turn 33 U to (4,6), turn 34 L to (3,6), then on turn 35, we can move D to (3,5), then on turn 36, move L to (2,5) but (2,5) gone on turn 36, so no eat.\n> \n> Turn 35 at (3,6), move to (3,5), then turn 36 at (3,5), move to (2,5) but (2,5) gone, so no eat.\n> \n> So with U first, we cannot eat the (2,5) food because by the time we get to (3,5), it's turn 36 or later, but it disappears on turn 36.\n> \n> To eat on turn 35, we need to be adjacent to (2,5) on turn 35, e.g. at (3,5), (2,6), or (2,4).\n> \n> In U first, on turn 35 we are at (3,6) or if we move to (3,5) on turn 35, but at (3,5) on turn 35, we can move to (2,5) on turn 35 to eat.\n> \n> Let's timeline:\n> \n> Turn 33: start at (4,5), move U to (4,6)\n> \n> Turn 34: move L to (3,6)\n> \n> Turn 35: move D to (3,5)  // now at (3,5) on turn 35\n> \n> From (3,5), we can move L to (2,5) on turn 35 to eat, since (2,5) is there with life span 1.\n> \n> Yes, so we can eat it on turn 35.\n> \n> Then same as before, we are at (2,5) with long snake, and may get stuck.\n> \n> But in this case, we ate the food, but then from (2,5) we have the same issue as with L first option.\n> \n> In L first option, we ate on turn 34, earlier.\n> \n> But the problem of

That means there's food under the snake's body at (5,4).\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. Also, there's a special case about tail reward danger if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (3,6), direction L, so it just moved left to (3,6) from, say, (4,6) which is now the neck.\n> \n> Since direction is L, and we're at (3,6), possible moves: since no instant reverse, I can't move right (R), because that would be opposite to current direction L.

So (3,5) is not in this list, so it should be free, unless wall or food.\n> \n> Walls: borders only, and internal obstacle (5,6). (3,5) is not a wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> Food: food at (2,5), (6,4), (6,5), (5,4). (5,4) is occupied by snake, but (3,5) is not food, I think. Food positions given: (2,5), (6,4), (6,5), (5,4). (3,5) is not listed, so empty.\n> \n> Left: (2,6) – x=2, y=6. Is this wall? Borders are x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so (2,6) is within bounds. Snake: not occupied, walls: not, so free? But let's confirm if there's food or something.\n> \n> No food at (2,6), so empty.\n> \n> Down: (3,5) as above.\n> \n> Right: (4,6) – but (4,6) is the second segment, snake body, so if I move right, I collide with body, death. But according to rules, moving into tail might be ok if tail moves, but let's see.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,1), and head is at (3,6), so (4,6) is adjacent to head but not tail; it's the neck.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for body segments, if head moves to a cell with a body segment, it's collision, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (4,6) is the segment right after head, so it's not tail; tail is (3,1). So moving to (4,6) would be collision with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, up is wall, down is (3,5), left is (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is empty?

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 35, life span is 1, so after turn 35, it's gone. To eat it, I need to be on (2,5) on turn 35.\n> \n> But we're at turn 35, and head is at (3,6). To eat (2,5), I need to move to (2,5) this turn.\n> \n> From (3,6), (2,5) is not directly adjacent; (3,6) to (2,5) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (3,6) adjacent: (3,5) down, (2,6) left, (4,6) right (invalid), (3,7) up (invalid).\n> \n> (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and down from (3,6), but not directly adjacent; I need to move to (2,6) or (3,5) first.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,6) this turn, then from (2,6), I can move down to (2,5) next turn, but that would be turn 36, and food (2,5) has life span 1, so it disappears after turn 35, meaning on turn 36 it's gone, so I can't eat it on turn 36.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Food at (2,5) with life span 1 at turn 35. So on turn 35, if eaten, good; if not, after turn 35, it disappears, so not available on turn 36.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (2,5), I must be on (2,5) on turn 35. But from (3,6), I can't reach (2,5) in one move; it's not adjacent. So impossible to eat (2,5) on this turn. Therefore, (2,5) will disappear after this turn without being eaten.\n> \n> So I should ignore (2,5) since it's not reachable in time.\n> \n> Now, other food:\n> \n> - (6,4) value 1, life span 3: so available for turns 35,36,37; disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> - (6,5) value 1, life span 6: available turns 35 to 40.\n> \n> - (5,4) value 1, life span 9: but (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake body.

It's turn 36, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2).

Let me confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upward or downward? The movement says U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y=0 is bottom or top? Movement: U (x,y+1) — so if y+1 is up, then y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top?

So countdown is 2, meaning it will decrease to 1 at turn 38, and to 0 at turn 39, disappearing at turn 39. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life_span=4, so available until turn 37+4-1=40? Let's think:\n> \n> - Turn 37: life_span=2, countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn 38: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 39: countdown=0, disappears before or after the turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span C, it is present during turn t. After the turn, if it was not eaten, countdown decreases by 1. If countdown reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard in games: at the beginning of turn, food is present with its life span. After the snake moves, if food is eaten, it's consumed; else, life span decreases. If life span becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Assume for simplicity: at turn t, with life span N, it means it has N turns left, including this one. So after N turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For (6,4) at turn 37, life_span=2: it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38. On turn 39, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life_span=4: available turns 37,38,39,40.\n> \n> (5,4) life_span=7: available many turns.\n> \n> (1,3) life_span=10: available many turns.\n> \n> Now, value: all are +1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,5), direction left. So it came from (3,5) to (2,5), moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can go U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left). But L is the current direction, so it's allowed, just not reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (2,5)\n> \n> Then: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So the tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> Food at: (6,4), (6,5), (5,4), (1,3)\n> \n> (5,4) is also a food position, but snake has a segment at (5,4)? Snake positions: (5,4) is part of the body, yes. (5,4) is the 7th segment? Let's index:\n> \n> Index 0: head (2,5)\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,6)\n> \n> 3: (4,6)\n> \n> 4: (4,5)\n> \n> 5: (5,5)\n> \n> 6: (5,4)\n> \n> 7: (4,4)\n> \n> 8: (4,3)\n> \n> 9: tail (3,3)\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is exactly where segment 6 is. But the rule says: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So (5,4) has food under it, but currently occupied by snake body. To eat it, we need that segment to move away, and then head to move to (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (6,4), (6,5), (1,3) are free.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (6,4) life 2, so must be eaten soon, by turn 38.\n> \n> (6,5) life 4, more time.\n> \n> (5,4) life 7, plenty of time.\n> \n> (1,3) life 10, plenty.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, current position: head at (2,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: to (2,6)\n> \n> - D: to (2,4)\n> \n> - L: to (1,5)  (since x decreases)\n> \n> - R: but cannot, because opposite to current direction L.\n> \n> So options: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid and safe.\n> \n> First, U to (2,6): is (2,6) within bounds? x=1-6, y=1-6, so (2,6) is y=6, which is border? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is not wall, it's playable. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (5,6), not (2,6).\n> \n> So (2,6) is empty? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So (2,6) is not in snake, and not wall, so it's free. But is it safe to move there? We need to consider future moves.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (2,4): (2,4) not in snake positions, not wall, free.\n> \n> L to (1,5): (1,5) not in snake, not wall, free? x=1 is ok since walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is playable.\n> \n> y=5 ok.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,3) is food, but not at (1,5).\n> \n> (1,3) is at y=3.\n> \n> Also, (6,4) and (6,5) are far.\n> \n> But (5,4) has food under it, but occupied.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at (3,3), and food at (1,3) which is close to tail.\n> \n> But head is at (2,5), so not adjacent yet.\n> \n> I need to think about paths.\n> \n> First, the food with short life: (6,4) must be eaten by turn 38, so within 2 turns.\n> \n> Turn 37: now, we choose action.\n> \n> Turn 38: next action.\n> \n> (6,4) can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) has more time.\n> \n> Now, (6,4) is at (6,4), which is near the bottom right.\n> \n> Head at (2,5), so to reach (6,4) quickly, it might be tight.\n> \n> But let's see possible paths.\n> \n> First, from (2,5), if I go L to (1,5), then I'm moving away from (6,4).\n> \n> If I go U to (2,6), then I can go right, but current direction would be U, so I can go R to (3,6), but (3,6) is occupied by snake body segment 2? Positions: (3,6) is segment, yes.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,6), then snake moves: head to (2,6), tail moves away from (3,3) to... when snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> But no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So if I move to (2,6), then new positions: head (2,6), then body: previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (3,5), (3,6), etc., and tail (3,3) is removed?

Valid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (0,4) → Wall (x=0). **Invalid**.\n4. **Right (R)**: (2,4) → Free. Valid.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n- **Down (D) to (1,3)**:\n  - Eat food at (1,3), grow to length 11.\n  - New head: (1,3), tail remains at (4,4).\n  - No immediate collision risk (tail is not adjacent to new head).\n- **Right (R) to (2,4)**:\n  - No food eaten, snake length remains 10.\n  - New head: (2,4), tail moves to (5,4).\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Eating (1,3) now (Down)**:\n   - Immediate reward (+1), but the snake grows longer (11), which may limit future mobility in the small grid.\n   - (1,3) has a long life span (until turn 47), so no urgency to eat it now.\n   - The other food at (5,4) is under the snake's body and requires freeing up the cell first.\n\n2. **Moving Right to (2,4)**:\n   - Avoids growing the snake unnecessarily.\n   - Frees up (5,4) for potential future eating (tail moves to (5,4), then further moves can free it).\n   - Allows planning to reach (5,4) before it disappears (turn 44).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Right (R) to (2,4)** is the better immediate move because:\n  - It avoids growing the snake prematurely.\n  - It starts the process of freeing (5,4) for future eating.\n  - (1,3) can be eaten later if needed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

Since it's moving down, and head is at (1,4), moving down would be to (1,3), but let's see the positions: head (1,4), then (1,5) which is above, so if head is at (1,4) and moving down, down would decrease y, so to (1,3), but the next segment is (1,5), which has higher y, so the snake is currently oriented with head down? Positions: (1,4) head, then (1,5) is body, which is north of head? Let's list coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (1,5)  // this is above (1,4), so y=5 > y=4, so north\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,5)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,5)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,6)  // north\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,6)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,5)  // south\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,5)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 8: (5,4)  // south\n> \n> - Segment 9: (4,4)  // west? (5,4) to (4,4) is west\n> \n> Tail at (4,4)\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down. But from head (1,4) to next (1,5), that's north, not down. Inconsistency?\n> \n> Head direction is the current moving direction. At turn 39, the head is at (1,4) and it is moving down, so last move was down to (1,4)? Positions: the list is from head to tail, so at turn 39, head is at (1,4), and it just moved there, I assume.\n> \n> The direction D means that in the previous turn, it moved down to reach (1,4). Since it moved down to (1,4), and before that it was at (1,5) or something. Let's see the positions: segment 1 is (1,5), which is directly above (1,4), so if head is at (1,4) and came from (1,5) by moving down? Moving down from (1,5) to (1,4) would decrease y.\n> \n> (1,5) to (1,4) is moving down, yes. So at turn 38, head was at (1,5), moved down to (1,4) at turn 39. So current position at turn 39 is (1,4), and head direction is D, meaning it just moved down.\n> \n> Now, for the next move, I can choose to go U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly to U, since that would be opposite of D. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,4):\n> \n> - Up: to (1,5) but (1,5) is occupied by the body segment. But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> - Down: to (1,3) - y=3, which is within bounds, I think. Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is playable.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so cannot move left.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,4) - is this occupied? Snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), etc. (2,4) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> List all snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> (2,4) is not occupied, so it should be free.\n> \n> Also, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) is occupied by wall, but not a cell we're considering now.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 39, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So if at turn t, life span is L, then at turn t, countdown is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For food at (6,5): life span 3 at turn 39, so it will be there for turn 39,40,41, disappear at turn 42.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): life span 5, so turn 39 to 43, disappear at 44.\n> \n> (1,3): life span 8, turn 39 to 46, disappear at 47.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,4), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,5) - but (1,5) is the second segment of the snake. If I move there, head collides with body, death. So invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (1,3) - (1,3) has food? Food at (1,3), yes, with value 1.\n> \n> But let's see if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> First, is (1,3) occupied? Snake positions: tail is at (4,4), and (1,3) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 is wall, (1,3) y=3 >0, so not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), not here.\n> \n> So moving down to (1,3) is possible.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,4) - x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,4) - (2,4) is not occupied by snake or wall, so free.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (1,3) or Right to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, Down leads to food at (1,3), which is positive, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, if I eat the food at (1,3), the tail is currently at (4,4). Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (1,4), tail at (4,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,4) and (4,4) are not adjacent; they are 3 units apart in x.\n> \n> So no issue, I can eat it safely.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new head at (1,3), and tail stays, but since I eat, length increases, so tail doesn't move immediately? When snake eats food, on the next turn, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move, and the tail doesn't advance, so you grow by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when you move to a food cell, you add that cell as new head, and the tail remains in place for that turn, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move down to (1,3), which has food, I eat it, so new head at (1,3), and the body segments follow, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (1,3), then previous head (1,4), then (1,5), etc., and tail still (4,4), but since I ate, the tail stays, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at head, so length 11 now.\n> \n> But in the list, it would be [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)] but (4,4) is the old tail, which should now be part of body, and since tail didn't move, it stays, but when the snake moves next, the tail will move away.\n> \n> But for now, at the moment of eating, no collision.\n> \n> Now, the other option is to move right to (2,4), no food there, so no growth.\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (1,3) has life span 8, so it will be there for a while, no rush to eat it immediately.\n> \n> (6,5) has only life span 3, so it disappears soon, at turn 42.\n> \n> (5,4) has life span 5, disappears at turn 44.\n> \n> (5,4) has food, but it's under the snake's body? Let's see: snake positions include (5,4), which is segment 9, I think, positions: index 8 is (5,4)? Let's index:\n> \n> 0: head (1,4)\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)  // this is the food location? Food at (5,4) is listed, but (5,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) with value 1 and life span 5.\n> \n> But (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake's 8th segment? Positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> Position 0: (1,4) - head\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)  // segment 8, which is the 9th segment? Index 0 is head, so segment 8 is the 9th position in the list, but it's the 9th segment of the snake? Snake has 10 segments, from 0 to 9.\n> \n> Index 0: head\n> \n> Index 1: body part 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Index 9: tail, which is (4,4)? Positions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n> \n> So index 0: (1,4)\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)\n> \n> 9: (4,4)  // tail\n> \n> So (5,4) is segment 8, which is part of the body, not the tail. Tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is under the snake's body at segment 8.\n> \n> Now, rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So to eat (5,4), the snake must move such that the body segment leaves (5,4), and then later the head can move there when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, for other cells.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (1,4): D to (1,3) or R to (2,4).\n> \n> If I go down to (1,3), I eat the food there, grow to 11 segments, head now at (1,3), direction down (since I moved down).\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U to (1,4) but (1,4) is now the second segment? After move, positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), etc., so (1,4) is occupied by body.\n> \n> D to (1,2) - y=2, within bounds.\n> \n> L to (0,3) - x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,3) - should be free.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> If I go right to (2,4), no food, head at (2,4), direction? Since I moved right from (1,4), which was moving down, but after moving right, direction is R.\n> \n> Then from (2,4), possible moves: U to (2,5) - (2,5) is segment 2, occupied, so invalid? (2,5) is in positions, index 2, so yes, occupied.\n> \n> D to (2,3) - free\n> \n> L to (1,4) - (1,4) is now the previous head, which is body segment, occupied, so invalid.\n> \n> R to (3,4) - should be free? Snake positions have (3,5), (3,6), but not (3,4), so free.\n> \n> Walls: no.\n> \n> So from (2,4), can go D or R.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food with short life span.\n> \n> (6,5) has only 3 turns left, including current, so it will be gone after turn 41? At turn 39, life span 3: present at 39,40,41, gone at 42.\n> \n> So I need to reach it by turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) has life span 5, so until turn 43.\n> \n> (1,3) has 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But (5,4) is under the body, so I need to move the snake to free it first.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (4,4), and food at (5,4) is under segment 8.\n> \n> To eat (5,4), I need the body to move away from (5,4).\n> \n> Currently, segment 8 is at (5,4), which is food.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move from (1,4) to (1,3) down, then new head (1,3), and each segment moves to the previous position, so segment 1 moves to (1,4), segment 2 to (1,5), ..., up to segment 9 (tail) moves to where segment 8 was, which is (5,4)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (1,4) head\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)\n> \n> 9: (4,4) tail\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), new head at (1,3), then:\n> \n> - New position 0: (1,3) head\n> \n> - Position 1: old position 0, (1,4)\n> \n> - Position 2: old position 1, (1,5)\n> \n> - Position 3: old position 2, (2,5)\n> \n> - Position 4: old position 3, (3,5)\n> \n> - Position 5: old position 4, (3,6)\n> \n> - Position 6: old position 5, (4,6)\n> \n> - Position 7: old position 6, (4,5)\n> \n> - Position 8: old position 7, (5,5)\n> \n> - Position 9: old position 8, (5,4)  // tail now at (5,4)\n> \n> And the old tail (4,4) is left, but since we ate food, we grow, so we add a new segment at tail? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, after moving to food cell, the tail does not move, so the length increases.\n> \n> Standard: when you move to a cell with food, you add that cell as new head, and the tail remains in place, so the snake extends by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: new head at food cell, and the previous positions are all kept, but the tail doesn't advance, so we have an extra segment.\n> \n> So after moving to (1,3) which has food:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then previous segments: (1,4) becomes body, (1,5) body, ..., up to tail (4,4) still there, and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions now: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)] but (4,4) is the old tail, which is now segment 10, and the segment that was at (5,4) is now at position 9? Let's index:\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Index 0: new head (1,3)\n> \n> - Index 1: old head (1,4)\n> \n> - Index 2: old index 1 (1,5)\n> \n> - Index 3: old index 2 (2,5)\n> \n> - Index 4: old index 3 (3,5)\n> \n> - Index 5: old index 4 (3,6)\n> \n> - Index 6: old index 5 (4,6)\n> \n> - Index 7: old index 6 (4,5)\n> \n> - Index 8: old index 7 (5,5)\n> \n> - Index 9: old index 8 (5,4)  // this was segment 8, now at position 9\n> \n> - Index 10: old tail (4,4)  // new tail, since we ate, tail didn't move, so (4,4) is still there as tail\n> \n> But (5,4) is now at index 9, and (4,4) at index 10.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) was under old segment 8, which is now at position 9: (5,4) but we moved, so the cell (5,4) is now occupied by index 9, which is body, and the food is still there? But when the snake moves, the body moves away from some cells.\n> \n> In this case, when we moved the head to (1,3), the segment that was at (5,4) moved to where? In the shift, each segment moves to the previous position's location except the head.\n> \n> In the new positions, the cell (5,4) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at (5,4), but since the tail didn't advance, (4,4) is still occupied, and (5,4) has a segment.\n> \n> But the food is at (5,4), which is now occupied by the snake body at index 9, so it's still under the body, not accessible.\n> \n> Specifically, after the move, position index 9 is at (5,4), so food is still under snake body.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake needs to move such that no segment is at (5,4), and then head can move there.\n> \n> Similarly, if I don't eat now, and move elsewhere.\n> \n> But let's think about the short-life food at (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is near the right border.\n> \n> From head at (1,4), to reach (6,5), it's 5 units away in x, 1 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, but I can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal moves, so minimum 6 moves, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n> \n> But (6,5) has only 3 turns left: must be eaten by turn 41.\n> \n> Turn 39,40,41 it is present.\n> \n> If I start from turn 39, I have 3 turns to reach it: turn 39,40,41.\n> \n> At turn 39, I am at (1,4), (6,5) is at distance |6-1| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6, so I need to cover 6 cells in 3 moves, which is impossible since each move is one cell. Minimum moves required is 6, but I have only 3 turns to move, meaning I can make 3 moves: to position at turn 40, 41, 42, but at turn 42 it disappears, so I need to be at (6,5) on turn 41 or earlier to eat it.\n> \n> Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> At turn t, I move, and after move, if head on food, I eat it.\n> \n> So at turn 39, after my move, if I go to food, I eat it at turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,5), to eat it at turn 41, I need to be on (6,5) after move on turn 41.\n> \n> From turn 39, I can move on turn 39,40,41.\n> \n> After turn 39 move, I am at some cell.\n> \n> After turn 40 move, at another.\n> \n> After turn 41 move, if I reach (6,5), I eat it.\n> \n> The distance from (1,4) to (6,5) is |6-1| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6 cells, so I need at least 6 moves to reach it, but I only have 3 moves: turn 39,40,41. So I can move only 3 steps, so at best I can be at a cell within 3 moves, but (6,5) is 6 away, so I cannot reach it in 3 moves. For example, after move 39, I might be at (2,4) or (1,3), both at distance 5 or 4.5, but Manhattan.\n> \n> From (1,4), after one move, I can be at (2,4) or (1,3), distance to (6,5): from (2,4) |4| + |1| =5, from (1,3) |5| + |2| =7? |6-2|=4, |5-4|=1, so 5; from (1,3) |6-1|=5, |5-3|=2, so 7? No, (1,3) to (6,5) is dx=5, dy=2, dist=7.\n> \n> (1,4) to (6,5) dx=5, dy=1, dist=6.\n> \n> After move to (2,4): (2,4) to (6,5) dx=4, dy=1, dist=5.\n> \n> After move to (1,3): (1,3) to (6,5) dx=5, dy=2, dist=7.\n> \n> Then after turn 40, from there, say from (2,4), I can reduce dist by 1, to dist 4 or so, but after two moves, min dist is 6-2=4 if I go directly, but from (2,4), after another move, say to (3,4) or (2,5) or (2,3), dist to (6,5) would be 3 or 4 or 5, etc. After three moves from start, min dist is 3, but (6,5) is at least 3 away after three moves, but since I need to be there at turn 41, which is after three moves, I can be at a cell that is at dist 3 from start, but (6,5) is dist 6, so after three moves I can be at most 3 cells closer, but 6-3=3, so I could be at dist 3, not at (6,5). For example, after three moves right and up, I could be at (4,5) or something, but not (6,5). Specifically, from (1,4), to reach (6,5) in exactly 3 moves, I need to move right 5 times and up once, but I can only move 3 times, so I can move right 3 times to (4,4), dist to (6,5) is 2+1=3; or right twice and up once to (3,5), dist 3+0=3; or other combinations, but I cannot reach (6,5) in 3 moves because it requires at least 5 right or 4 right and 1 up, etc., min moves is 5 if I go directly, but since I can only move 3 times, I cannot reach (6,5) by turn 41.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (6,5) because it disappears after turn 41, and I cannot reach it in the available moves.\n> \n> Similarly, for turn 41: I need to be at (6,5) after move on turn 41.\n> \n> But from turn 39, after move 39, I am at say P39.\n> \n> After move 40, at P40.\n> \n> After move 41, at P41.\n> \n> P41 must be (6,5).\n> \n> But P39 is at dist at least 1 from (1,4), P40 at dist at least 2, P41 at dist at least 3 from (1,4), but (6,5) is dist 6, so unless P41 is (6,5), which requires moving 6 steps, impossible in 3 moves. So yes, cannot eat (6,5). So I should ignore it, as it will disappear soon and I can't reach it.\n> \n> Now, the other food: (5,4) is under body, life span 5, so until turn 43.\n> \n> (1,3) is free, life span 8.\n> \n> But (5,4) is under body, so I need to free it.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 10 segments, so space is tight.\n> \n> Now, let's consider moving to (1,3) or to (2,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), I eat the food, grow to 11, head at (1,3), direction D.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go down to (1,2) or right to (2,3), since up to (1,4) is body, left wall.\n> \n> But eating (1,3) might not be urgent, and it increases length, making the snake longer, which might be riskier in this small grid.\n> \n> Grid is 6x6 playable, 36 cells, snake 10, after eating 11, so 25 free cells, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Internal wall at (5,6), which is occupied.\n> \n> But (5,6) is wall, not playable.\n> \n> Playable cells: from (1,1) to (6,6), minus (5,6) wall, so 35 cells? 6x6=36, minus one wall, 35 cells.\n> \n> Snake 10, so 25 free, after eating 11, 24 free.\n> \n> But with food on board.\n> \n> Now, if I don't eat now, I can go to (2,4), then I might be able to free (5,4) or go for other things.\n> \n> (5,4) food is under body at segment 8.\n> \n> To free it, I need the snake to move so that no segment is at (5,4).\n> \n> Currently, segment 8 is at (5,4).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the segments shift, so if I move, segment 8 will move to where segment 7 was, which is (5,5), and segment 9 (tail) moves to (5,4)?

Let me confirm: x=0/x=7 means walls at x=0 and x=7, similarly y=0 and y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I believe, but let's see the snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), etc., and food at (6,5), (5,4), (1,3). (1,3) is within 1 to 6, so yes, grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y, with walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is a wall cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4). So the snake is 10 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning down. Since it's moving down, and head is at (1,4), moving down would be to (1,3), but let's see the positions: head (1,4), then (1,5) which is above, so if head is at (1,4) and moving down, down would decrease y, so to (1,3), but the next segment is (1,5), which has higher y, so the snake is currently oriented with head down? Positions: (1,4) head, then (1,5) is body, which is north of head? Let's list coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (1,5)  // this is above (1,4), so y=5 > y=4, so north\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,5)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,5)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,6)  // north\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,6)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,5)  // south\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,5)  // east\n> \n> - Segment 8: (5,4)  // south\n> \n> - Segment 9: (4,4)  // west?

Inconsistency?\n> \n> Head direction is the current moving direction. At turn 39, the head is at (1,4) and it is moving down, so last move was down to (1,4)? Positions: the list is from head to tail, so at turn 39, head is at (1,4), and it just moved there, I assume.\n> \n> The direction D means that in the previous turn, it moved down to reach (1,4). Since it moved down to (1,4), and before that it was at (1,5) or something. Let's see the positions: segment 1 is (1,5), which is directly above (1,4), so if head is at (1,4) and came from (1,5) by moving down? Moving down from (1,5) to (1,4) would decrease y.\n> \n> (1,5) to (1,4) is moving down, yes. So at turn 38, head was at (1,5), moved down to (1,4) at turn 39. So current position at turn 39 is (1,4), and head direction is D, meaning it just moved down.\n> \n> Now, for the next move, I can choose to go U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly to U, since that would be opposite of D.

So at turn 39, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So if at turn t, life span is L, then at turn t, countdown is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For food at (6,5): life span 3 at turn 39, so it will be there for turn 39,40,41, disappear at turn 42.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): life span 5, so turn 39 to 43, disappear at 44.\n> \n> (1,3): life span 8, turn 39 to 46, disappear at 47.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,4), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,5) - but (1,5) is the second segment of the snake.

Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (1,4), tail at (4,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,4) and (4,4) are not adjacent; they are 3 units apart in x.\n> \n> So no issue, I can eat it safely.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new head at (1,3), and tail stays, but since I eat, length increases, so tail doesn't move immediately? When snake eats food, on the next turn, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move, and the tail doesn't advance, so you grow by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when you move to a food cell, you add that cell as new head, and the tail remains in place for that turn, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move down to (1,3), which has food, I eat it, so new head at (1,3), and the body segments follow, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (1,3), then previous head (1,4), then (1,5), etc., and tail still (4,4), but since I ate, the tail stays, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at head, so length 11 now.\n> \n> But in the list, it would be [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)] but (4,4) is the old tail, which should now be part of body, and since tail didn't move, it stays, but when the snake moves next, the tail will move away.\n> \n> But for now, at the moment of eating, no collision.\n> \n> Now, the other option is to move right to (2,4), no food there, so no growth.\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (1,3) has life span 8, so it will be there for a while, no rush to eat it immediately.\n> \n> (6,5) has only life span 3, so it disappears soon, at turn 42.\n> \n> (5,4) has life span 5, disappears at turn 44.\n> \n> (5,4) has food, but it's under the snake's body? Let's see: snake positions include (5,4), which is segment 9, I think, positions: index 8 is (5,4)? Let's index:\n> \n> 0: head (1,4)\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)  // this is the food location?

Positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> Position 0: (1,4) - head\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)  // segment 8, which is the 9th segment?

Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (1,4) head\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)\n> \n> 9: (4,4) tail\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), new head at (1,3), then:\n> \n> - New position 0: (1,3) head\n> \n> - Position 1: old position 0, (1,4)\n> \n> - Position 2: old position 1, (1,5)\n> \n> - Position 3: old position 2, (2,5)\n> \n> - Position 4: old position 3, (3,5)\n> \n> - Position 5: old position 4, (3,6)\n> \n> - Position 6: old position 5, (4,6)\n> \n> - Position 7: old position 6, (4,5)\n> \n> - Position 8: old position 7, (5,5)\n> \n> - Position 9: old position 8, (5,4)  // tail now at (5,4)\n> \n> And the old tail (4,4) is left, but since we ate food, we grow, so we add a new segment at tail? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, after moving to food cell, the tail does not move, so the length increases.\n> \n> Standard: when you move to a cell with food, you add that cell as new head, and the tail remains in place, so the snake extends by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: new head at food cell, and the previous positions are all kept, but the tail doesn't advance, so we have an extra segment.\n> \n> So after moving to (1,3) which has food:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then previous segments: (1,4) becomes body, (1,5) body, ..., up to tail (4,4) still there, and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions now: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)] but (4,4) is the old tail, which is now segment 10, and the segment that was at (5,4) is now at position 9? Let's index:\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Index 0: new head (1,3)\n> \n> - Index 1: old head (1,4)\n> \n> - Index 2: old index 1 (1,5)\n> \n> - Index 3: old index 2 (2,5)\n> \n> - Index 4: old index 3 (3,5)\n> \n> - Index 5: old index 4 (3,6)\n> \n> - Index 6: old index 5 (4,6)\n> \n> - Index 7: old index 6 (4,5)\n> \n> - Index 8: old index 7 (5,5)\n> \n> - Index 9: old index 8 (5,4)  // this was segment 8, now at position 9\n> \n> - Index 10: old tail (4,4)  // new tail, since we ate, tail didn't move, so (4,4) is still there as tail\n> \n> But (5,4) is now at index 9, and (4,4) at index 10.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) was under old segment 8, which is now at position 9: (5,4) but we moved, so the cell (5,4) is now occupied by index 9, which is body, and the food is still there? But when the snake moves, the body moves away from some cells.\n> \n> In this case, when we moved the head to (1,3), the segment that was at (5,4) moved to where? In the shift, each segment moves to the previous position's location except the head.\n> \n> In the new positions, the cell (5,4) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at (5,4), but since the tail didn't advance, (4,4) is still occupied, and (5,4) has a segment.\n> \n> But the food is at (5,4), which is now occupied by the snake body at index 9, so it's still under the body, not accessible.\n> \n> Specifically, after the move, position index 9 is at (5,4), so food is still under snake body.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake needs to move such that no segment is at (5,4), and then head can move there.\n> \n> Similarly, if I don't eat now, and move elsewhere.\n> \n> But let's think about the short-life food at (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is near the right border.\n> \n> From head at (1,4), to reach (6,5), it's 5 units away in x, 1 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, but I can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal moves, so minimum 6 moves, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n> \n> But (6,5) has only 3 turns left: must be eaten by turn 41.\n> \n> Turn 39,40,41 it is present.\n> \n> If I start from turn 39, I have 3 turns to reach it: turn 39,40,41.\n> \n> At turn 39, I am at (1,4), (6,5) is at distance |6-1| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6, so I need to cover 6 cells in 3 moves, which is impossible since each move is one cell. Minimum moves required is 6, but I have only 3 turns to move, meaning I can make 3 moves: to position at turn 40, 41, 42, but at turn 42 it disappears, so I need to be at (6,5) on turn 41 or earlier to eat it.\n> \n> Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> At turn t, I move, and after move, if head on food, I eat it.\n> \n> So at turn 39, after my move, if I go to food, I eat it at turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,5), to eat it at turn 41, I need to be on (6,5) after move on turn 41.\n> \n> From turn 39, I can move on turn 39,40,41.\n> \n> After turn 39 move, I am at some cell.\n> \n> After turn 40 move, at another.\n> \n> After turn 41 move, if I reach (6,5), I eat it.\n> \n> The distance from (1,4) to (6,5) is |6-1| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6 cells, so I need at least 6 moves to reach it, but I only have 3 moves: turn 39,40,41. So I can move only 3 steps, so at best I can be at a cell within 3 moves, but (6,5) is 6 away, so I cannot reach it in 3 moves. For example, after move 39, I might be at (2,4) or (1,3), both at distance 5 or 4.5, but Manhattan.\n> \n> From (1,4), after one move, I can be at (2,4) or (1,3), distance to (6,5): from (2,4) |4| + |1| =5, from (1,3) |5| + |2| =7? |6-2|=4, |5-4|=1, so 5; from (1,3) |6-1|=5, |5-3|=2, so 7? No, (1,3) to (6,5) is dx=5, dy=2, dist=7.\n> \n> (1,4) to (6,5) dx=5, dy=1, dist=6.\n> \n> After move to (2,4): (2,4) to (6,5) dx=4, dy=1, dist=5.\n> \n> After move to (1,3): (1,3) to (6,5) dx=5, dy=2, dist=7.\n> \n> Then after turn 40, from there, say from (2,4), I can reduce dist by 1, to dist 4 or so, but after two moves, min dist is 6-2=4 if I go directly, but from (2,4), after another move, say to (3,4) or (2,5) or (2,3), dist to (6,5) would be 3 or 4 or 5, etc. After three moves from start, min dist is 3, but (6,5) is at least 3 away after three moves, but since I need to be there at turn 41, which is after three moves, I can be at a cell that is at dist 3 from start, but (6,5) is dist 6, so after three moves I can be at most 3 cells closer, but 6-3=3, so I could be at dist 3, not at (6,5). For example, after three moves right and up, I could be at (4,5) or something, but not (6,5). Specifically, from (1,4), to reach (6,5) in exactly 3 moves, I need to move right 5 times and up once, but I can only move 3 times, so I can move right 3 times to (4,4), dist to (6,5) is 2+1=3; or right twice and up once to (3,5), dist 3+0=3; or other combinations, but I cannot reach (6,5) in 3 moves because it requires at least 5 right or 4 right and 1 up, etc., min moves is 5 if I go directly, but since I can only move 3 times, I cannot reach (6,5) by turn 41.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (6,5) because it disappears after turn 41, and I cannot reach it in the available moves.\n> \n> Similarly, for turn 41: I need to be at (6,5) after move on turn 41.\n> \n> But from turn 39, after move 39, I am at say P39.\n> \n> After move 40, at P40.\n> \n> After move 41, at P41.\n> \n> P41 must be (6,5).\n> \n> But P39 is at dist at least 1 from (1,4), P40 at dist at least 2, P41 at dist at least 3 from (1,4), but (6,5) is dist 6, so unless P41 is (6,5), which requires moving 6 steps, impossible in 3 moves. So yes, cannot eat (6,5). So I should ignore it, as it will disappear soon and I can't reach it.\n> \n> Now, the other food: (5,4) is under body, life span 5, so until turn 43.\n> \n> (1,3) is free, life span 8.\n> \n> But (5,4) is under body, so I need to free it.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 10 segments, so space is tight.\n> \n> Now, let's consider moving to (1,3) or to (2,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), I eat the food, grow to 11, head at (1,3), direction D.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go down to (1,2) or right to (2,3), since up to (1,4) is body, left wall.\n> \n> But eating (1,3) might not be urgent, and it increases length, making the snake longer, which might be riskier in this small grid.\n> \n> Grid is 6x6 playable, 36 cells, snake 10, after eating 11, so 25 free cells, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Internal wall at (5,6), which is occupied.\n> \n> But (5,6) is wall, not playable.\n> \n> Playable cells: from (1,1) to (6,6), minus (5,6) wall, so 35 cells? 6x6=36, minus one wall, 35 cells.\n> \n> Snake 10, so 25 free, after eating 11, 24 free.\n> \n> But with food on board.\n> \n> Now, if I don't eat now, I can go to (2,4), then I might be able to free (5,4) or go for other things.\n> \n> (5,4) food is under body at segment 8.\n> \n> To free it, I need the snake to move so that no segment is at (5,4).\n> \n> Currently, segment 8 is at (5,4).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the segments shift, so if I move, segment 8 will move to where segment 7 was, which is (5,5), and segment 9 (tail) moves to (5,4)?

It's turn 41. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4).

No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, walls at borders and (5,6).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,4), moving right.\n> \n> From head: (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Food: (6,5) life 1, (5,4) life 3, but (5,4) is where the tail is. Food can be under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically, (5,4) has food, and it's the tail position. So if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, and then head moves to (5,4), it could eat it, but there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head is at (3,4), tail at (5,4). Are they adjacent? (3,4) and (5,4) are two units apart in x, same y, so not adjacent. Adjacent would be one step away, like (3,4) and (4,4) or (3,5), etc.\n> \n> Distance: |3-5| = 2, |4-4| = 0, so not adjacent. So tail reward danger doesn't apply here because head is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Head is at (3,4), tail at (5,4), so positions differ by 2 in x, so not adjacent. Therefore, it might be safe to eat the food at (5,4) under certain conditions.\n> \n> But first, let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so from (3,4), it can move to (4,4), (3,5) up, (3,3) down, or since direction is R, it can't reverse to left instantly, but it can turn up or down.\n> \n> Movement constraints: can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) on this turn. So possible moves: U (up, to (3,5)), D (down, to (3,3)), or R (right, to (4,4)). L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions.\n> \n> First, if move R to (4,4): is (4,4) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> So (4,4) is not in this list, so not occupied by body. Walls: (4,4) is within bounds, x=4 between 1 and 6, y=4 between 1 and 6, not a wall. Internal obstacle at (5,6), not (4,4). So (4,4) is empty, safe to move.\n> \n> If move U to (3,5): (3,5) is in snake positions, it's the sixth segment? Positions: index 0 head (3,4), 1 (2,4), 2 (1,4), 3 (1,5), 4 (2,5), 5 (3,5), so (3,5) is a body segment, occupied. Cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, move D to (3,3): (3,3) not in snake positions, and not a wall, so should be safe.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=3 is fine, x=3 fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: R to (4,4) or D to (3,3). U to (3,5) is occupied, not possible.\n> \n> Now, food: (6,5) with life span 1, meaning if not eaten this turn, it disappears. Current turn is 41, so if not eaten now, gone.\n> \n> (5,4) with life span 3, so disappears after turn 43? Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So for (6,5): life span 1, so after this turn (turn 41), it disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 43 if not eaten by then.\n> \n> (1,3) life span 6, disappear after turn 46.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,4). To eat (6,5), which is at (6,5). From (3,4), to reach (6,5), need to go right and up.\n> \n> But (6,5) must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> Current position (3,4), (6,5) is three right and one up, so cannot reach in one move. Minimum two moves: e.g., right to (4,4), then up-right to (5,5) or something, but (6,5) is at (6,5), from (4,4) it's two right and one up, still not adjacent. From (3,4) to (6,5) requires at least two moves, but since we can only move one step per turn, it's impossible to reach (6,5) this turn because |dx|=3, |dy|=1, min moves 3, but with diagonal not allowed, so min 3 moves: e.g., right, right, up-right or something, but each move is one step, so to go from (3,4) to (6,5), need to change x by 3, y by 1, so at least three moves, e.g., R to (4,4), R to (5,4), then U to (5,5)? (5,5) to (6,5) is one right, but (5,5) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Let's see path.\n> \n> From (3,4), after move, head moves to new position.\n> \n> This turn, turn 41, if I move, head goes to new cell.\n> \n> To eat (6,5) on turn 41, head must be at (6,5) after move.\n> \n> But head is at (3,4), cannot reach (6,5) in one move, since max move one step. So impossible to eat (6,5) this turn. Therefore, (6,5) will disappear after this turn and cannot be eaten. So we should ignore it, as it's not reachable and will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is at (5,4), which is currently occupied by the tail. So to eat it, the snake must move such that the tail moves away, then head moves to (5,4) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,4), and food is there.\n> \n> If the snake moves, the tail will move only if the head moves and the snake doesn't eat, but when it eats, tail doesn't move, but here food is under tail.\n> \n> General rule: to eat food under body, body must move away, then head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically for (5,4), which is tail, when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves forward, so (5,4) becomes empty, then if head moves to (5,4) later, it can eat.\n> \n> But with the tail reward danger if head adjacent.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,4), tail at (5,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> Possible moves for turn 41:\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (4,4)\n> \n> After move, snake positions: head to (4,4), then body: since no food eaten, tail moves off (5,4) to the next, but tail is at (5,4), when head moves to (4,4), the segment that was at (4,4) moves? Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So current positions: [H(3,4), A(2,4), B(1,4), C(1,5), D(2,5), E(3,5), F(3,6), G(4,6), H(4,5), I(5,5), J(5,4)] tail J(5,4)\n> \n> If move R to (4,4), new head at (4,4). Then body: A moves to (3,4), B to (2,4), C to (1,4), D to (1,5), E to (2,5), F to (3,5), G to (3,6), H to (4,6), I to (4,5), and tail J is removed, so new tail is I(4,5)? Positions: new head (4,4), then the previous positions: the first body segment is the old head position (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), and (5,5) is now the last? Let's list:\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (3,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (3,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After move head to (4,4): new head (4,4), then body: old pos 0: (3,4) becomes new pos 1, old pos 1: (2,4) new pos 2, old pos 2: (1,4) new pos 3, old pos 3: (1,5) new pos 4, old pos 4: (2,5) new pos 5, old pos 5: (3,5) new pos 6, old pos 6: (3,6) new pos 7, old pos 7: (4,6) new pos 8, old pos 8: (4,5) new pos 9, old pos 9: (5,5) new pos 10, and old tail (5,4) is removed, so new snake: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5). Length still 11.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is still there, but now (5,4) is empty? After move, (5,4) is no longer occupied, since tail moved to (5,5)? New positions: head (4,4), tail (5,5), so (5,4) is free now.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) has life span 3, so it remains for now.\n> \n> Similarly, if move D to (3,3): new head (3,3), then body: old head (3,4) becomes new pos 1, then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), and tail (5,4) removed, so new snake: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) tail. (5,4) free.\n> \n> Now, back to choices for turn 41.\n> \n> I can move R to (4,4) or D to (3,3).\n> \n> If I move R to (4,4), head at (4,4), which is adjacent to (5,4) east, but (5,4) has food, and it's now free.\n> \n> From (4,4), I could move to (5,4) next turn to eat it.\n> \n> But let's see if head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), tail is at (5,5), head at (4,4), adjacent? (4,4) and (5,5) are diagonal, not adjacent in grid terms, since moves are U/D/L/R, so adjacent only orthogonally.\n> \n> So |dx| + |dy| =1 for adjacent.\n> \n> (4,4) to (5,5) is dx=1, dy=1, not adjacent. Tail is at (5,5), head at (4,4), so not adjacent.\n> \n> Then, if I move to (5,4) from (4,4), that would be east, to (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) has food, value 1.\n> \n> If I move to (5,4) and eat it, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> After eating, new head at (5,4), and the body: since ate, the tail stays, so positions: new head (5,4), then previous head (4,4), then the body as before but tail not removed.\n> \n> Current before move to (5,4): suppose turn 41 I moved to (4,4), so at start of turn 42, snake is at [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), ..., (5,5)] as above.\n> \n> Then turn 42, move R to (5,4). (5,4) has food, so eat it. New head at (5,4), and since food eaten, the snake grows, so the tail does not move. New positions: head (5,4), then previous head (4,4), then the rest: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), and since ate, the tail (5,5) stays, so now length 12, with tail at (5,5).\n> \n> But is there a collision? Head at (5,4), and (5,5) is part of body, but (5,4) and (5,5) are adjacent vertically, but head is at (5,4), and (5,5) is a body segment, but in the positions, (5,5) is the last segment, but after growth, it's not the tail anymore? Positions: new head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). So (5,5) is the tail now? Index: 0: (5,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (3,4), ..., up to 10: (4,5)? List: positions after growth: head (5,4), then the previous body: first was (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), and then the old tail (5,5) is added as new segment, so positions: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). So tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, head at (5,4), and body segments include (4,5), (5,5), etc. (5,5) is the tail, and (4,5) is also there.\n> \n> Is head colliding with body? Head at (5,4), body positions: (4,4), (3,4), etc., (4,5), (5,5). (5,4) is not equal to any other position except itself, so no collision. (4,5) is different, (5,5) different. So safe.\n> \n> But tail reward danger: head at (5,4), tail at (5,5), which are adjacent orthogonally? (5,4) and (5,5) same x, dy=1, so adjacent.

So if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, and then head moves to (5,4), it could eat it, but there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head is at (3,4), tail at (5,4).

Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) on this turn. So possible moves: U (up, to (3,5)), D (down, to (3,3)), or R (right, to (4,4)).

Walls: (4,4) is within bounds, x=4 between 1 and 6, y=4 between 1 and 6, not a wall. Internal obstacle at (5,6), not (4,4). So (4,4) is empty, safe to move.\n> \n> If move U to (3,5): (3,5) is in snake positions, it's the sixth segment? Positions: index 0 head (3,4), 1 (2,4), 2 (1,4), 3 (1,5), 4 (2,5), 5 (3,5), so (3,5) is a body segment, occupied.

From (3,4) to (6,5) requires at least two moves, but since we can only move one step per turn, it's impossible to reach (6,5) this turn because |dx|=3, |dy|=1, min moves 3, but with diagonal not allowed, so min 3 moves: e.g., right, right, up-right or something, but each move is one step, so to go from (3,4) to (6,5), need to change x by 3, y by 1, so at least three moves, e.g., R to (4,4), R to (5,4), then U to (5,5)? (5,5) to (6,5) is one right, but (5,5) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Let's see path.\n> \n> From (3,4), after move, head moves to new position.\n> \n> This turn, turn 41, if I move, head goes to new cell.\n> \n> To eat (6,5) on turn 41, head must be at (6,5) after move.\n> \n> But head is at (3,4), cannot reach (6,5) in one move, since max move one step.

Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So current positions: [H(3,4), A(2,4), B(1,4), C(1,5), D(2,5), E(3,5), F(3,6), G(4,6), H(4,5), I(5,5), J(5,4)] tail J(5,4)\n> \n> If move R to (4,4), new head at (4,4).

Length still 11.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is still there, but now (5,4) is empty? After move, (5,4) is no longer occupied, since tail moved to (5,5)? New positions: head (4,4), tail (5,5), so (5,4) is free now.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) has life span 3, so it remains for now.\n> \n> Similarly, if move D to (3,3): new head (3,3), then body: old head (3,4) becomes new pos 1, then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), and tail (5,4) removed, so new snake: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) tail. (5,4) free.\n> \n> Now, back to choices for turn 41.\n> \n> I can move R to (4,4) or D to (3,3).\n> \n> If I move R to (4,4), head at (4,4), which is adjacent to (5,4) east, but (5,4) has food, and it's now free.\n> \n> From (4,4), I could move to (5,4) next turn to eat it.\n> \n> But let's see if head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), tail is at (5,5), head at (4,4), adjacent?

(5,4) has food, so eat it. New head at (5,4), and since food eaten, the snake grows, so the tail does not move. New positions: head (5,4), then previous head (4,4), then the rest: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), and since ate, the tail (5,5) stays, so now length 12, with tail at (5,5).\n> \n> But is there a collision? Head at (5,4), and (5,5) is part of body, but (5,4) and (5,5) are adjacent vertically, but head is at (5,4), and (5,5) is a body segment, but in the positions, (5,5) is the last segment, but after growth, it's not the tail anymore? Positions: new head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). So (5,5) is the tail now? Index: 0: (5,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (3,4), ..., up to 10: (4,5)?

Head at (5,4), body positions: (4,4), (3,4), etc., (4,5), (5,5). (5,4) is not equal to any other position except itself, so no collision. (4,5) is different, (5,5) different. So safe.\n> \n> But tail reward danger: head at (5,4), tail at (5,5), which are adjacent orthogonally? (5,4) and (5,5) same x, dy=1, so adjacent. But tail reward danger is when eating the food at the tail cell when head is adjacent to tail before eating.\n> \n> In this case, when we move to (5,4) to eat, before eating, at the start of turn, head was at (4,4), tail at (5,5), which are not adjacent, as |dx|=1, |dy|=1. So head was not adjacent to tail before moving. Therefore, no tail reward danger.

Also, since current direction is R, L is reverse, not allowed anyway.

No.\n> \n> When moving, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So after head moves to new position, the new position 1 is old position 0, position 2 is old position 1, and so on, up to position 11 is old position 10, and old position 11 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So for cell (1,5): old position 5 was (1,5). After move, position 5 is now old position 4, which was (1,4). So the cell (1,5) is no longer occupied, because position 5 is now at (1,4), and position 6 is at old (1,5), which is (2,5) now? Let's clarify.\n> \n> After one move with no growth:\n> \n> - New position 0: new head position\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to 11\n> \n> - Then since no growth, the last position (old position 11) is removed, so the snake has one less segment? No, when no food, the tail is removed, so the snake length decreases? No, the snake moves forward, so the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> The number of segments remains the same only if we eat food; otherwise, when moving, we add a new head position and remove the tail position, so length same.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves to a new cell without eating, the head occupies the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of cells: the cell that was tail is now empty, and the new head cell is occupied, other cells shift.\n> \n> For a specific cell, like (1,5), it was occupied by segment 5.\n> \n> After one move, segment 5 is now at the position of old segment 4, which is (1,4). So (1,5) is now occupied by... no, segment 5 has moved to (1,4), and segment 6 was at (2,5), now moves to old position 5, which was (1,5). So cell (1,5) is now occupied by the new segment 6, which was previously at (2,5) but now at old (1,5).\n> \n> Positions:\n> \n> Old: 0: (5,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4), no eat:\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - New 0: (6,4)  // new head\n> \n> - New 1: old 0 = (5,4)\n> \n> - New 2: old 1 = (4,4)\n> \n> - New 3: old 2 = (3,4)\n> \n> - New 4: old 3 = (2,4)\n> \n> - New 5: old 4 = (1,4)  // this was segment 4, now segment 5 is at (1,4)\n> \n> - New 6: old 5 = (1,5)  // segment 6 is now at (1,5)\n> \n> - New 7: old 6 = (2,5)\n> \n> - New 8: old 7 = (3,5)\n> \n> - New 9: old 8 = (3,6)\n> \n> - New 10: old 9 = (4,6)\n> \n> - New 11: old 10 = (4,5)  // tail now at (4,5), old tail (5,5) removed\n> \n> So cell (1,5) is still occupied by new segment 6.\n> \n> Similarly, if we keep moving, (1,5) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves away, which depends on the snake's movement.\n> \n> To vacate (1,5), we need the snake to move in such a way that the body leaves that cell, which might take time because it's in the middle.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, and (1,5) is part of the body, it will take multiple moves to free it, and it requires the head to move in a direction that pulls the body away from that area.\n> \n> But currently, the head is at (5,4), far from (1,5), so it will take several turns to affect that part.\n> \n> For example, to free (1,5), we need the segment that is currently at (1,5) to move to a different cell, and no other segment to move to (1,5), which means the snake must be moving away from that position.\n> \n> But from the positions, the snake has a loop or something.\n> \n> Let's see the path: from head (5,4) left to (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), then down to (1,5), then right to (2,5), (3,5), then up to (3,6), then right?

Old position 11 was (5,5), which is now the new head, so we add new head at (5,5), and remove old tail, which was also (5,5), but since it's the same cell, it's like the tail is not removed, but the head occupies it.

It's turn 44, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, but I should confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but since walls occupy those cells, the snake can only be in cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Let me list the snake positions to verify.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). That's 12 segments. Head is at (5,3) and direction is down, which is decreasing y, I think? Let's clarify directions.\n> \n> Directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So D is down, which decreases y.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction D, so last move was down to (5,3). From (5,4) to (5,3) since direction is D.\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 44, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 46? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,3) with life span 3 on turn 44:\n> \n> - Turn 44: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 45: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 46: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 47: life span 0, so it disappears after turn 46? Countdown decreases, so after turn 44, it has 2 turns left? I need to be precise.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns including turn t? No.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, when we say \"life_span = 3\" at turn t, it means the food will disappear after t + N - 1 or something? I think I need an example.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span N. After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1. After turn t+1, it decreases to N-2, and so on, until after turn t + (N-1), it decreases to 0, and then it disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For turn 44, life_span 3: it is present on turns 44, 45, 46. After turn 46, it disappears, so not present on turn 47.\n> \n> Similarly, for the other food: (1,5) with value 1 and life span 9. So it will be around for many turns.\n> \n> Value: both are +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction D. Current possible moves: since direction is D, I cannot move U immediately because that would be reverse, but the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from D, I cannot move U on the next turn. But I can move L, R, or D again.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: (5,4) but that's the body segment? Snake positions: head (5,3), then body: (5,4), (4,4), etc.\n> \n> (5,4) is the second segment, so moving U to (5,4) would be moving into the body, which is a collision, except if it's the tail, but let's see.\n> \n> General collision rule: body collision if head touches any body segment. But exception: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward, so it's safe, as long as the new position isn't occupied by another body part.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (4,5). Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] so tail is (4,5).\n> \n> Now, from head (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,4): but (5,4) is occupied by the second segment, which is not the tail, so it's a body collision, deadly. Cannot move there.\n> \n> - D to (5,2): is this within bounds? Walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so (5,2) should be ok, since y=2 >0 and <7? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6? x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Grid: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> So cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n> \n> (5,2): x=5 between 1-6, y=2 between 1-6, no obstacle, so it should be free? But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n> \n> So (5,2) is not in this list, so it should be empty and safe to move to.\n> \n> - L to (4,3): (4,3) not in snake positions, so empty? Let's see: snake has (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), but not (4,3). Also, x=4, y=3, should be within bounds, no wall or obstacle. Obstacle is at (5,6), not here. So (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> - R to (6,3): (6,3) - x=6, y=3, between 1-6, no snake, no wall, obstacle at (5,6) not here, so free.\n> \n> But walls: x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok since x=7 is wall, but x=6 is playable. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=3 is fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3). U is invalid because body collision.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food available: (1,3) and (1,5).\n> \n> (1,3) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 46. Current turn 44, so if I don't eat it by turn 46, it's gone.\n> \n> (1,5) has life span 9, so it will be around until turn 44 + 9 - 1 = 52? Turn 44: life span 9, present turns 44 to 52? After turn 52, it disappears.\n> \n> Life span N at turn t: present from t to t + N - 1.\n> \n> So (1,3): N=3, t=44, present turns 44,45,46.\n> \n> (1,5): N=9, t=44, present turns 44 to 52.\n> \n> Now, (1,5) is at (1,5), which is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (1,5), which is the 7th segment? Positions: index 0: head (5,3), 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), etc.\n> \n> So (1,5) is a body segment. But there is food at (1,5), but it's under the snake body.\n> \n> The rule: food can spawn under snake body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (1,5) is occupied by the snake, so I cannot eat it now. I need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (1,5), then later I can move the head there to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,3), which is not occupied by snake, so I can potentially eat it if I move there.\n> \n> (1,3) is at (1,3), and snake is not there, so it's accessible.\n> \n> But let's see the map.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,5), head at (5,3). Distance: |5-4| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Head (5,3), tail (4,5): not adjacent; (5,3) to (4,5) is diagonal, not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, let's think about paths to food.\n> \n> First, food at (1,3): it's at (1,3), and head at (5,3), same y, different x. Distance |5-1| = 4 in x, same y.\n> \n> To reach (1,3) from (5,3), I need to move left, but there are obstacles.\n> \n> Path: from (5,3) to (1,3), I need to go left to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). But (3,3) and (2,3) might be free? Let's see occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n> \n> So (4,3) not occupied, (3,3) not occupied, (2,3) not occupied, (1,3) not occupied. Also, no walls except borders, obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> So path to (1,3) is clear: left to (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). That's 3 moves left.\n> \n> But I need to consider the life span: only available until turn 46, so I have from turn 44 to 46 to eat it.\n> \n> Turn 44: if I move L to (4,3), then turn 45: to (3,3), turn 46: to (2,3), then turn 47: to (1,3), but turn 47 is after 46, food disappears after turn 46, so not present on turn 47. So I need to be at (1,3) on or before turn 46.\n> \n> If I move directly left:\n> \n> - Turn 44: move to (4,3) - not eating, since no food there.\n> \n> - Turn 45: to (3,3)\n> \n> - Turn 46: to (2,3) - still not at (1,3)\n> \n> - Turn 47: to (1,3) but food gone.\n> \n> I need to reach (1,3) by turn 46 at latest.\n> \n> But from (5,3), moving left each turn: turn 44: to (4,3), turn 45: to (3,3), turn 46: to (2,3) — that's only to (2,3) on turn 46, not (1,3).\n> \n> (1,3) is one more step, but I can't reach it by turn 46 from here with only left moves.\n> \n> Unless I start moving left now.\n> \n> But from (5,3), after moving to (4,3), I'm at (4,3) on turn 45? Let's clarify turns.\n> \n> Current turn 44: I choose action for turn 44.\n> \n> After action, snake moves, then turn increases.\n> \n> So at start of turn 44, I decide move.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,3), then after move, head at (4,3), and turn becomes 45.\n> \n> Then turn 45: I can move L to (3,3), head at (3,3), turn 46.\n> \n> Turn 46: move L to (2,3), head at (2,3), turn 47.\n> \n> But food at (1,3) disappears after turn 46, so on turn 46, it is still present, but I am at (2,3), not (1,3). To eat on turn 46, I need to be at (1,3) during turn 46 action.\n> \n> But on turn 46, I am at (2,3), I move to (1,3) only on turn 47, which is too late.\n> \n> So I cannot eat (1,3) if I start moving left now, because it takes 4 moves to go from (5,3) to (1,3): (5,3) to (4,3) in one move, (3,3) in second, (2,3) in third, (1,3) in fourth. So minimum 4 moves.\n> \n> But I have only 3 turns to act: turn 44,45,46 to eat it by turn 46.\n> \n> Turn 44 action: can move towards it.\n> \n> Turn 45 action.\n> \n> Turn 46 action: if I reach (1,3) on turn 46 action, I eat it.\n> \n> But from (5,3), after turn 44 action, if I move L, to (4,3) at end of turn 44.\n> \n> Turn 45: from (4,3), move L to (3,3).\n> \n> Turn 46: from (3,3), move L to (2,3) — not (1,3).\n> \n> I need to be at (3,3) by turn 45 to move to (1,3) on turn 46? From (3,3) to (2,3) on turn 46, not (1,3).\n> \n> To be at (1,3) on turn 46, I need to be at (2,3) on turn 45, then move to (1,3) on turn 46.\n> \n> But on turn 44, I am at (5,3). After turn 44 action, I can be at (4,3) if move L.\n> \n> Then on turn 45, from (4,3), if I move L to (3,3), I am at (3,3) end of turn 45.\n> \n> Then on turn 46, from (3,3) move L to (2,3), at (2,3), not (1,3).\n> \n> If on turn 44 I move L to (4,3), turn 45 move L to (3,3), turn 46 move L to (2,3) — that's three moves, to (2,3), and (1,3) is still one away.\n> \n> No way to reach (1,3) in fewer than 4 moves from (5,3).\n> \n> But the food is only available for 3 turns including current: turns 44,45,46.\n> \n> On turn 44, if I could move directly to (1,3), but I can't, it's too far.\n> \n> So it's impossible to eat (1,3) because I can't reach it by turn 46 with the moves I have.\n> \n> Is that right? Let's calculate Manhattan distance: from (5,3) to (1,3) is |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 units, so 4 moves needed. But I have only 3 actions: on turn 44,45,46 to be at (1,3) on one of those turns.\n> \n> After turn 44 action, I can be at most at (4,3), which is distance 3 from (1,3), so still 3 moves away? From (4,3) to (1,3) is 3 moves: to (3,3), (2,3), (1,3).\n> \n> But I need to reach (1,3) by turn 46.\n> \n> After turn 44: if at (4,3), then turn 45: to (3,3) or? From (4,3), I can move to (3,3) on turn 45.\n> \n> Then after turn 45, at (3,3).\n> \n> Then turn 46: move to (2,3), at (2,3).\n> \n> Not at (1,3).\n> \n> If on turn 44 I move to a different place, but (1,3) is left, so moving left is the only way, but it's too slow.\n> \n> Perhaps I can go up or down to go around, but that would take even longer, since y is the same.\n> \n> For example, if I move U, but U is invalid, body at (5,4).\n> \n> Or D to (5,2), then L to (4,2), etc., but that's even farther from (1,3).\n> \n> Similarly, R to (6,3) is away.\n> \n> So indeed, it's impossible to reach (1,3) by turn 46 from (5,3) because the minimum moves required is 4, but I only have 3 chances to move before turn 47.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (1,3); it will disappear uneaten.\n> \n> So I should ignore it and focus on the other food or long-term survival.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (1,5) with life span 9, so I have until turn 52 to eat it.\n> \n> But (1,5) is currently under the snake body at position (1,5), which is segment index 6.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the body to move away from (1,5), then head to move there.\n> \n> Currently, the snake is moving, and as it moves, the tail will move, so positions change.\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (5,3)\n> \n> 1: body (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (2,4)\n> \n> 5: (1,4)\n> \n> 6: (1,5)\n> \n> 7: (2,5)\n> \n> 8: (3,5)\n> \n> 9: (3,6)\n> \n> 10: (4,6)\n> \n> 11: tail (4,5)\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> When no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, the segment at the tail end is removed if no food, so that cell becomes empty.\n> \n> But if food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> For food at (1,5), it's currently occupied, so when the snake moves, if the segment moves away, it might become free.\n> \n> Let's see the current position: (1,5) is occupied by segment 6.\n> \n> As the snake moves, this segment will move to where segment 5 was, which is (1,4)? When head moves, segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, and so on, up to segment 6 moving to where segment 5 was.\n> \n> Segment 5 is at (1,4), so when the snake moves, segment 6 will move to (1,4), and (1,5) will be vacated, because the tail moves from (4,5) to where segment 10 was or something.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> After a move, the new positions: head at new position, then the first body segment at previous head position, second body segment at previous first body position, etc., and the last body segment (tail) is at the position of the previous second last segment, so the previous tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, after one move, if no food eaten, the tail at (4,5) is removed, and a new tail is at the previous position of segment 10, which is (4,6)? Segment 10 is (4,6), but segment 11 is tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Positions: let's number from head: 0: (5,3), 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (3,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (4,5) — (4,5) is segment 11, tail.\n> \n> After moving, say head moves to new cell, then new head at new position, new segment 1 at old head (5,3), new segment 2 at old segment 1 (5,4), new segment 3 at old segment 2 (4,4), and so on, up to new segment 11 at old segment 10 (4,6). And the old segment 11 position (4,5) is now empty.\n> \n> But for segment 6, which was at (1,5), it moves to old segment 5 position, which is (1,4). So (1,5) is vacated because segment 6 moved to (1,4), and no segment is at (1,5) anymore? Not necessarily, because the positions shift.\n> \n> After one move with no food eaten:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position, say P\n> \n> - Then body: new position 1: old position 0\n> \n> New position 2: old position 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New position 11: old position 10\n> \n> And old position 11 is vacated.\n> \n> Old position 6 was (1,5), which is now occupied by new position 6, but new position 6 is old position 5, which was (1,4). So the cell (1,5) is now the position of new segment 6, which is old (1,4), but (1,4) is different cell.\n> \n> The cell (1,5) is no longer occupied because segment 6 moved to (1,4) (old segment 5 position), and the cell (1,5) is free, but only if no other segment moves there, but since segments move to previous positions, (1,5) is not occupied in the new snake positions.\n> \n> For example, after move:\n> \n> New head at, say, (5,2) if move D.\n> \n> Then new pos 1: old pos 0 = (5,3)\n> \n> New pos 2: old pos 1 = (5,4)\n> \n> New pos 3: old pos 2 = (4,4)\n> \n> New pos 4: old pos 3 = (3,4)\n> \n> New pos 5: old pos 4 = (2,4)\n> \n> New pos 6: old pos 5 = (1,4)  // segment 6 now at (1,4)\n> \n> New pos 7: old pos 6 = (1,5)  // segment 7 at (1,5)?

Head (6,4) + 11 bodies = 12, but one removed, should be 11.\n> \n> Count: after move, head (6,4), then the first body is the previous head (6,3), then previous body1 (5,3), body2 (5,4), body3 (4,4), body4 (3,4), body5 (2,4), body6 (1,4), body7 (1,5), body8 (2,5), body9 (3,5), body10 (3,6). That's 11 segments: head + 10 bodies? List: 1. (6,4) head, 2. (6,3), 3. (5,3), 4. (5,4), 5. (4,4), 6. (3,4), 7. (2,4), 8. (1,4), 9. (1,5), 10. (2,5), 11. (3,5), and that's it? Previous body10 was (3,6), which should be included.\n> \n> Previous positions had 12: indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> After move, head to new position, and the body consists of positions 0 to 10 of previous, with position 0 becoming the first body segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,4), then body at previous positions [0] to [10]: that is (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6). Previous [10] is (3,6), and [11] (4,6) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6)]  // 12 positions? Head and 11 bodies, but length should be same, 12, but one segment removed, so length decreases only if not eating food.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, the tail end is removed, so the number of segments decreases? No, in snake game, when not eating, the snake moves forward, tail cell is vacated, but the length remains the same; the head moves to new cell, tail cell is freed, so the body shifts, but the number of segments is constant unless eating food.\n> \n> I think I confused myself.\n> \n> In this context, from the state, snake positions have 12 segments. When the snake moves and does not eat food, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is abandoned, so the new snake has the same number of segments, but the tail position changes.\n> \n> For example, from [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), ... (4,6)], after moving head to (6,4), the new head is (6,4), the first body segment is at (6,3) (previous head), the second at (5,3) (previous first body), and so on, up to the last body at (3,6) (previous second last), and the tail at (4,6) is removed, so the new positions are from (6,4) down to (3,6), but (3,6) was previously occupied, and (4,6) is free now.\n> \n> The new snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and (3,6) as the new tail. (3,6) was the 10th in previous, and after move, it becomes the 11th body or tail.\n> \n> Previous: 12 positions.\n> \n> After move: head new position, then the first 11 positions of the previous list become the body, so 12 segments still? No.\n> \n> Let's think: the snake has a list of cells. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is removed from the list. So the new list has the new head followed by all but the last cell of the previous list.\n> \n> Previous list: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P11, with P0 head, P11 tail.\n> \n> After moving to new cell H_new, the new list is [H_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P10]. P11 is removed.\n> \n> So the new tail is P10.\n> \n> In this case, previous: P0=(6,3), P1=(5,3), P2=(5,4), P3=(4,4), P4=(3,4), P5=(2,4), P6=(1,4), P7=(1,5), P8=(2,5), P9=(3,5), P10=(3,6), P11=(4,6)\n> \n> After move U to (6,4): new head H_new=(6,4), new list: [(6,4), P0=(6,3), P1=(5,3), P2=(5,4), P3=(4,4), P4=(3,4), P5=(2,4), P6=(1,4), P7=(1,5), P8=(2,5), P9=(3,5), P10=(3,6)]  // P11=(4,6) removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,4), body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), tail (3,6).\n> \n> 11 segments? Head and 10 bodies? List has 12 elements: index 0 to 11, but index 0 is head, index 1 to 11 are body segments, so 11 body segments? No: in the list, there are 12 cells: head at index 0, and 11 body segments from index 1 to 11. But the length is the number of segments, so 12 segments.\n> \n> After move, new list has 12 elements: [H_new, P0, P1, ..., P10], which is 12 positions. P10 was the second last, now last, and P11 removed, but since we add H_new, the number of segments remains the same.\n> \n> Yes, in snake, length doesn't change unless eating food.\n> \n> So here, from 12 positions, after move, still 12 positions, with P11 removed and H_new added.\n> \n> In new list: 12 positions.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D to (6,2), similar thing.\n> \n> Back to turn 45.\n> \n> I can move U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, let's look at the food.\n> \n> Food at (1,3) with life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 46. I need to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But head is at (6,3), (1,3) is at (1,3), which is 5 cells left, but I can't move directly because of the body.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8? Walls x=0 to 7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal (5,6).\n> \n> So playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> x=1 to 6 inclusive? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are playable, similarly y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> But (5,6) is internal obstacle, so not playable.\n> \n> So available cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except (5,6).\n> \n> Head at (6,3), which is playable.\n> \n> (1,3) is at (1,3), playable.\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), but currently occupied by snake body.\n> \n> To eat (1,3), I need to get the head there.\n> \n> From (6,3) to (1,3) is left along y=3.\n> \n> But on y=3, from x=6 to x=1, but the snake body is on some cells.\n> \n> Current positions on y=3: head (6,3), then (5,3), and also (1,4), (1,5) etc, but on y=3 specifically: (6,3) and (5,3).\n> \n> If I move left to (5,3), but (5,3) is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision, since head touches body.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3), which is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any occupied cell is bad.\n> \n> So from (6,3), moving L to (5,3) is invalid because it's occupied and also opposite direction, but even if not opposite, it's occupied.\n> \n> For turn 45, only U or D are possible and safe.\n> \n> Now, let's consider moving U or D.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (6,4) on turn 45.\n> \n> Then head at (6,4).\n> \n> Now, direction was R, but after moving U, new head direction is U.\n> \n> For next turn, turn 46, from (6,4), I can move U, L, R, but not D (opposite).\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4):\n> \n> - U to (6,5)\n> \n> - L to (5,4)\n> \n> - R to (7,4) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So U or L.\n> \n> (6,5): not occupied?

(5,4) is in the list, position after head, it's the third segment or something.

After movement, if head moves to (6,3), and the tail moves forward, then the segment that was at (6,3) moves to where the head was or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front. The tail is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to a cell that is currently the tail position is safe because after movement, the tail moves away.\n> \n> But moving to a cell that is a body segment (not tail) will cause collision because that segment doesn't move away; it stays and the head hits it.\n> \n> Except for the tail cell.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,3): it is index 1, not the tail. Tail is (3,6). So (6,3) is a body segment that will not be vacated immediately; only the tail cell is vacated if no growth.\n> \n> So moving to (6,3) would cause collision because after movement, head is at (6,3), but the segment that was there moves to (6,4) or something? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,4), seg1 (6,3), seg2 (5,3), etc.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,3): new head position (6,3).\n> \n> Then, the body segments: the segment that was at (6,3) moves to where the head was, which is (6,4), but since head moved to (6,3), the new segment 1 is at (6,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: after moving head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it in the list.\n> \n> So, new head position: (6,3) if I move down.\n> \n> Then, the segment that was seg1 (6,3) now becomes the new segment 1, but it moves to the old head position (6,4)? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift: the first body segment (index 1) moves to the old head position (6,4), index 2 moves to where index 1 was (6,3), but index 1 was (6,3), so index 2 moves to (6,3)? Messy.\n> \n> Better to think: the new body starts from the old head position.\n> \n> After movement:\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head position (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position (6,3)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 position (5,3)\n> \n> And so on, down to tail.\n> \n> But new segment 2 is at (6,3), and new head is also at (6,3)? Conflict.\n> \n> No: positions are simultaneous after move.\n> \n> When head moves to (6,3), which was occupied by segment 1.\n> \n> Then, segment 1 moves to the previous position of the head, which is (6,4).\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to the previous position of segment 1, which was (6,3), but (6,3) is now the head, so segment 2 moves to (6,3), but head is already there, so collision.\n> \n> Exactly: if you move to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, it will move to a new position, but in this case, since segment 1 is moving to (6,4), and segment 2 is moving to where segment 1 was, (6,3), but head is now at (6,3), so when segment 2 tries to move to (6,3), it's occupied by head, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to any body cell except the tail cell causes collision because that body segment will be there or moving there.\n> \n> The only safe body cell to move to is the tail cell, because when you move there, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, (6,3) is not the tail; tail is (3,6), so moving to (6,3) is unsafe.\n> \n> Similarly, for other cells.\n> \n> So from (6,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,5): is this free? (6,5) not in positions, and not wall? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, (6,5) is within bounds, no internal obstacle, so safe.\n> \n> - D to (6,3): but (6,3) is body segment, not tail, so unsafe.\n> \n> - L to (5,4): (5,4) is in positions, index 3? Positions: (5,4) is index 3, which is body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision. Unsafe.\n> \n> - R to (7,4): x=7 is wall, so unsafe.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move from here is U to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? L to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by segment 3, not tail, so yes, unsafe.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,3) unsafe.\n> \n> R wall.\n> \n> U to (6,5) is empty, so safe.\n> \n> But current direction is U, and I'm moving U, which is fine, not reverse.\n> \n> So for turn 46, I must move U to (6,5).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Walls occupy cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so those cells are blocked. Internal obstacle (5,6) also blocked.\n> \n> So cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> (6,5): x=6, y=5, x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine, y=5 fine. (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,5) is not (5,6), so (6,5) should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> So yes, only possible move is U.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 46, action must be U.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (6,5), what happens.\n> \n> New head position: (6,5)\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail moves: tail was (3,6), so new tail is the next segment, but positions shift.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,5)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old seg1 (6,3)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old seg2 (5,3)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old seg3 (5,4)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old seg4 (4,4)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old seg5 (3,4)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old seg6 (2,4)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old seg7 (1,4)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old seg8 (1,5)\n> \n> - New segment 10: old seg9 (2,5)\n> \n> - New segment 11: old seg10 (3,5)\n> \n> - New segment 12: old seg11 (3,6)? Old tail was (3,6), which was index 11, so after move, since no food, tail is removed, so the new snake has one fewer segment? No.\n> \n> Number of segments: original positions have 12 segments: indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> After move with no food eaten, the head moves to new position, and all segments shift, so the tail is removed.\n> \n> So new snake has 11 segments? Let's list old positions:\n> \n> Old: idx 0: (6,4) head, idx1: (6,3), idx2: (5,3), idx3: (5,4), idx4: (4,4), idx5: (3,4), idx6: (2,4), idx7: (1,4), idx8: (1,5), idx9: (2,5), idx10: (3,5), idx11: (3,6) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,5) (U), no food.\n> \n> New head: (6,5)\n> \n> New body:\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head position (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 position (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old seg2 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old seg3 position (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old seg4 position (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: old seg5 position (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: old seg6 position (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 8: old seg7 position (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 9: old seg8 position (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 10: old seg9 position (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 11: old seg10 position (3,5)\n> \n> Old tail (3,6) is removed, so no segment for old seg11; new snake has 11 segments, from (6,5) to (3,5).\n> \n> Old seg10 was (3,5), which becomes new segment 11.\n> \n> Old seg11 (3,6) is gone.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Now, head direction was U, and I moved U, so new direction is U.\n> \n> Now, it's turn 47.\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5 turns, but since for turn 46 I have only one choice, I must do that.\n> \n> But for future turns, I need to plan.\n> \n> Also, food: (1,3) with life span 1, since turn 46, if not eaten now, it disappears after this turn. But I moved to (6,5), not eating it, so it vanishes.\n> \n> (1,5) has life span 7, so it will be there for 7 turns including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn 46, food (1,3) has life span 1, so after turn 46, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) has life span 7 at turn 46, so it will last until turn 46 + 6 = 52? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N means it disappears after N turns, counting down each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t+L-1, it disappears? Standard: if life span decreases every turn, including current, then at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for turns t to t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, (1,3) at turn 46, life span 1, so present only at turn 46, disappears after turn 46, so not there at turn 47.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) at turn 46, life span 7, so present from turn 46 to 52, disappears at turn 53? Turns: at turn 46, life span 7, after turn 46, life span becomes 6, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears.\n> \n> So it is present for turns 46,47,48,49,50,51,52 (7 turns), disappears at turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 10, present from turn 46 to 55.\n> \n> Now, after turn 46, I'm at (6,5), direction U.\n> \n> Food (1,3) is gone.\n> \n> Food (1,5) is at (1,5), which is now part of the snake body? After move, new positions: (1,5) is segment 10?

(6,6): within bounds? x=6, y=6. Walls: y=7 is wall, but (6,6) is y=6, which should be playable? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall. x=6 not wall. But internal obstacle: (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) is different. So (6,6) should be free, not in snake positions? New positions: all positions, (6,6) not listed, so free. So U to (6,6) possible.\n> \n> - D to (6,4): but (6,4) is now segment 1, body segment, not tail (tail is (3,5)), so moving to (6,4) would cause collision, unsafe.\n> \n> - L to (5,5): (5,5) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle is (5,6)), so free.

Walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,6) is corner, but x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok, y=6 is ok. Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is different.\n> \n> (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) is fine.\n> \n> Now, is (6,6) occupied? Snake positions: from the list, (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), etc. No (6,6), so empty. Also, no food there, so moving to (6,6) is safe, no collision, no food.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Move L: left to (5,5)\n> \n> (5,5) - is it occupied? Snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), etc. (5,4) is at y=4, x=5, but (5,5) is not listed, so probably empty. Also, no food at (5,5).\n> \n> Move R: right to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, since border cells x=7 is wall. So moving R to (7,5) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so cannot move to x=7.\n> \n> Similarly, D is not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions this turn: U or L.\n> \n> U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,5) and (5,3).\n> \n> (1,5) is a food position, but look at snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc. (1,5) is occupied by the snake body!

However, since the snake body is on it, we cannot eat it immediately because the head is not on it. We can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3), which is occupied by segment 3: (5,3).\n> \n> Food positions: (1,5) and (5,3), both have snake body on them.\n> \n> (1,5) has food and is occupied by snake body at position 9.\n> \n> (5,3) has food and is occupied by snake body at position 3.\n> \n> To eat (1,5) food, we need the body to move away from (1,5), then head to move to (1,5).\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3).\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail?

Since the snake moves, when the tail moves, but (1,5) is not the tail; tail is (3,5).\n> \n> The segment at (1,5) will move when the snake moves forward, depending on the path.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3).\n> \n> Perhaps we should consider moving towards areas where we can free up the food.\n> \n> Since both foods are positive, we want to eat them, but we need to do it safely.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves for turn 47: U or L.\n> \n> Move U to (6,6): (6,6) is empty, no issue. Then from there, we can move U, but y=6, U would be (6,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. So from (6,6), possible moves: D (down to (6,5)), but (6,5) will be body after we move, L to (5,6), or R to (7,6) invalid.\n> \n> (5,6) is obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (6,6), moves: D to (6,5), which is where the neck is, but after we move head to (6,6), the body will be: new head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), etc. So (6,5) is the first body segment.\n> \n> Moving D to (6,5) would be moving back onto the body, which is collision, since it's not the tail; the tail is at (3,5), far away.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,6), the positions become: head (6,6), then segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) — and tail is still (3,5), but when we move, the tail moves only if we don't eat food.\n> \n> Since we didn't eat food, length same, so tail moves away from (3,5) to the next position.\n> \n> Current tail is (3,5). After one move without eating, the new tail will be the previous position of the second last segment, but in snake movement, when moving, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So after moving to (6,6) without eating, the new snake positions: head (6,6), then (6,5) (previous head), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — and the last segment (3,5) is removed, so tail is now (2,5).\n> \n> Positions: after move U to (6,6):\n> \n> - Head: (6,6)\n> \n> - Body: positions 1 to 11: but since no growth, the last segment is gone.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (3,5)\n> \n> After move, head to (6,6), so new position 0: (6,6)\n> \n> Then position 1: old position 0: (6,5)\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1: (6,4)\n> \n> Position 3: old position 2: (6,3)\n> \n> Position 4: old position 3: (5,3)\n> \n> Position 5: old position 4: (5,4)\n> \n> Position 6: old position 5: (4,4)\n> \n> Position 7: old position 6: (3,4)\n> \n> Position 8: old position 7: (2,4)\n> \n> Position 9: old position 8: (1,4)\n> \n> Position 10: old position 9: (1,5)\n> \n> Position 11: old position 10: (2,5)  // since tail moves, old position 11 is removed\n> \n> So new tail is position 10: (2,5)\n> \n> And food at (1,5) is still there, but now occupied by position 9: (1,5)?

So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1? Example: if life span is 1 at turn t, it disappears after that turn, so can be eaten only on turn t. If life span 2, can be eaten on turn t or t+1, disappears after t+1.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, inclusive, and disappears after turn t + L - 1, so not available on turn t + L.\n> \n> For (1,5) at turn 48, life span 6: can be eaten from turn 48 to 53 (since 48 + 6 - 1 = 53), disappears after turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 8: can be eaten from turn 48 to 55 (48 + 8 - 1 = 55).\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,5), direction L, so it can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since it's moving left, reverse would be right, so it cannot move R on the next turn. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but not R.\n> \n> Current head position (5,5). Possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (5,6)\n> \n> - D: to (5,4)\n> \n> - L: to (4,5)\n> \n> - R: to (6,5) but R is reverse, not allowed because current direction is L. So cannot move right.\n> \n> Available moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Borders are walls, so cells from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are inside, but x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so the grid cells are (x,y) with x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls. So snake can only be on cells where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, I think. Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to 6 inclusive, that's 6 cells, but since x=0 and x=7 are walls, yes, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so 6x6 grid? No.\n> \n> Coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6 are free, except for obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is within bounds.\n> \n> (5,6): x=5, y=6. Since y=6 is not border? y=6 is not y=7 or y=0, so it's playable, but has an obstacle, so snake cannot go there.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) and (5,3) are food positions.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (5,5), body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n> \n> (1,5) is a food position, but it's also occupied by the snake's 10th segment? Positions: segment 10: (1,4)? List indices.\n> \n> Index 0: head (5,5)\n> \n> 1: (6,5)\n> \n> 2: (6,4)\n> \n> 3: (6,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (4,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,4)\n> \n> 9: (1,4)\n> \n> 10: (1,5)  <-- this is the tail? No, after (1,4) is (1,5), then (2,5)\n> \n> (1,5) is segment 10, and (2,5) is segment 11. Since there are 12 segments, (2,5) is the last one, so tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> But (1,5) is a food position, and it's currently occupied by segment 10 of the snake.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> But the snake is on (1,5), so according to the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Here, (1,5) has food, and it's under segment 10. To eat it, the snake needs to move such that segment 10 moves away, and then head moves to (1,5).\n> \n> But segment 10 is not the tail; tail is at (2,5). When the snake moves, the tail will move, so segments shift.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is under segment 4? Segment 4 is (5,3), which is a body segment.\n> \n> (5,3) has food, and it's occupied by segment 4.\n> \n> To eat (5,3), the body must move away, then head moves there.\n> \n> Now, current turn 48, head at (5,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Let's see what each move does:\n> \n> - U: to (5,6). But (5,6) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is a wall, cannot move there. Deadly collision.\n> \n> - D: to (5,4). (5,4) is segment 5? Positions: segment 5 is (5,4). So moving to (5,4) which is a body segment. Is that collision?\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment. Since (5,4) is occupied by segment 5, moving head there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> - L: to (4,5). What is at (4,5)? Looking at snake positions, (4,5) is not listed; segments are: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), etc., no (4,5). So (4,5) should be free? But let's check if it's within bounds.\n> \n> x=4, y=5, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so yes, free. No wall or obstacle mentioned except borders and (5,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle only at (5,6), so (4,5) is free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by food? Food at (1,5) and (5,3), not (4,5). So (4,5) is empty.\n> \n> So moving L to (4,5) is safe.\n> \n> Now, only L is possible? U to (5,6) wall, D to (5,4) body, R not allowed. So only possible move is L to (4,5).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Head at (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n> \n> After moving, the snake will have new head at (4,5), and tail moves forward, so segment 11 (2,5) might be the new tail or something. Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail segment is removed or something? No, in Snake, when it moves without eating, the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> Specifically: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added at tail, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But here, no food is being eaten immediately, since moving to (4,5) which has no food.\n> \n> So after move L to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Then body: previous head (5,5) becomes segment 1, (6,5) segment 2, (6,4) segment 3, (6,3) segment 4, (5,3) segment 5, (5,4) segment 6, (4,4) segment 7, (3,4) segment 8, (2,4) segment 9, (1,4) segment 10, (1,5) segment 11, and tail was (2,5) which is segment 11? Positions: let's list with indices.\n> \n> Initial positions:\n> \n> 0: (5,5) head\n> \n> 1: (6,5)\n> \n> 2: (6,4)\n> \n> 3: (6,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (4,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,4)\n> \n> 9: (1,4)\n> \n> 10: (1,5)\n> \n> 11: (2,5)  // tail\n> \n> After moving left to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Then segment 1: old head (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old seg2 (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old seg3 (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old seg4 (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: old seg5 (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: old seg6 (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 8: old seg7 (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 9: old seg8 (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 10: old seg9 (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 11: old seg10 (1,5)\n> \n> - And tail old seg11 (2,5) is left, so it disappears, but since no food eaten, tail moves away, so the new tail is old seg10 (1,5), but in the list, segment 10 was (1,4), now it's (1,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> After move: head to (4,5)\n> \n> Then body segment 1: position that was head, (5,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: position that was seg1, (6,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 11: position that was seg10, which was (1,5)\n> \n> Old seg10 was (1,5), so new segment 11: (1,5)\n> \n> But old seg11 (2,5) is not part of snake anymore.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n> \n> (1,5) is now the tail.\n> \n> And food at (1,5) is still there, under the tail now? But the tail is at (1,5), so food is under tail.\n> \n> To eat it, the tail must move away, then head moves there.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 48, I must move, and only possible move is L to (4,5).\n> \n> But after that, the state changes.\n> \n> The question is to output an action sequence for multiple turns, starting from turn 48.\n> \n> Action sequence for turn 48, then turn 49, etc., but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> At turn 48, only possible action is L, to (4,5).\n> \n> Then turn 49, head at (4,5), and direction: since moved left, new direction is L.\n> \n> Now possible moves from (4,5): U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n> \n> But R is reverse?

Let's count: positions list has 12 elements: index 0 head (4,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: (4,4), 8: (3,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (1,4), 11: (1,5). So 12 segments, length 12.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it was moving left to (4,5).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,5): value 1, life span 5. But (1,5) is the tail, so food is under tail.\n> \n> - (5,3): value 1, life span 7. (5,3) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (5,3) is index 5, which is a body segment. Position 5 is (5,3), which has food? But food is at (5,3) with life span 7.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) has food.\n> \n> Now, for food under body: (5,3) has a body segment on it, and food is there. According to rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on later. But since it's not the head, it's not eaten now.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,5), it's under tail.\n> \n> Current turn is 49. Life spans: for (1,5), life span 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, meaning it will disappear at turn 49 + 5 = 54? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 49, life span is 5, then after this turn, it becomes 4, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 54? Turn when life span becomes 0 it disappears, I think.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning at turn t + L, it is gone. For example, at turn 49, life span 5, so after turn 49, life span becomes 4, then after turn 50, 3, ..., after turn 53, life span 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 54 or something. But for eating, as long as life span >0, it can be eaten during the turn.\n> \n> Typically, the countdown decreases at the end of the turn, so at turn t, with life span L, at the beginning of turn t, it is present, and after the turn, L decreases.\n> \n> But for movement and eating, during turn t, if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, life span decreases after the turn.\n> \n> I think that's standard.\n> \n> So for food at (1,5): life span 5 at turn 49. After turn 49, it becomes 4, and so on, until after turn 53, it becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 54. So it can be eaten from turn 49 to turn 53 inclusive? At turn 53, if eaten, life span might be 1 before eating, but after eating, it's consumed.\n> \n> Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> Assume: at the start of turn t, food with life span L is present. If snake eats it during t, L doesn't decrease for that food since it's consumed. Otherwise, at end of turn, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> Similarly for disappearance: if L reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (1,5) at turn 49, L=5. Can be eaten on turn 49,50,51,52,53. If not eaten by turn 53, after turn 53, L=0, disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) L=7 at turn 49, can be eaten turns 49 to 55.\n> \n> (6,2) L=10, turns 49 to 58.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. Head at (4,5), direction L, so it just moved left to (4,5). Possible moves: since direction is L, it can go U, D, L (not R, because reverse is R, which is opposite, so not allowed).\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so cannot move R (right). Can move U (up), D (down), or L (left).\n> \n> Now, let's see the adjacent cells from head (4,5):\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) – y=6, x=4\n> \n> - Down: (4,4) – but (4,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,4) is index 7, which is a body segment.\n> \n> - Left: (3,5) – x=3, y=5\n> \n> - Right: (5,5) – but (5,5) is index 1, body segment, and also reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (4,6) – is this valid? Walls: border y=7, so y=6 is not border, x=4 not border. Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) is not (5,6), so should be free? But is it occupied? Snake: positions don't include (4,6), so free.\n> \n> - D: (4,4) – occupied by snake body at index 7, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - L: (3,5) – free? Check: not in walls, not obstacle, not in snake positions? Positions: (3,4) is index 8, (2,4) index 9, etc., no (3,5), so free.\n> \n> - R: not allowed, and also occupied.\n> \n> So from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), L to (3,5). D is invalid due to body collision.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, food: (1,5) is under tail, but tail is at (1,5), and head is at (4,5), not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head are (4,6), (3,5), (5,5) invalid, (4,4) invalid.\n> \n> (1,5) is not adjacent to head; it's far away.\n> \n> But (1,5) has food under it. Since the tail will move when the snake moves, if the snake moves, the tail might leave (1,5), and then the food is exposed, and if head goes there later, it can be eaten. But there's Tail Reward Danger if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (1,5), head at (4,5), distance is 3 in x, 0 in y, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Other food: (5,3) is occupied by body at index 5, so not accessible now. (6,2) is free.\n> \n> (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> Life spans: (1,5) has short life, only 5 turns left, so we might want to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But to eat (1,5), we need the tail to move away, and head to move there.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (1,5). When the snake moves, depending on direction, the tail moves.\n> \n> The tail movement depends on the head movement and the body.\n> \n> The snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail, unless it eats food.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, tail is not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,5) food, if we eat it, since it's under tail, but when we move, if tail moves away, and head moves to (1,5), then it can be eaten.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide if adjacent.\n> \n> In this case, currently, tail at (1,5), head at (4,5), not adjacent.\n> \n> But if we move towards (1,5), and at some point head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, then eating it would be bad.\n> \n> Currently, the tail has food under it, so if head is ever adjacent to tail while food is there, eating that food is dangerous.\n> \n> But we can only eat it when head moves onto it, which requires that the tail has moved away first.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 49.\n> \n> From head (4,5), can go U to (4,6) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> If go U to (4,6), then new head position (4,6), direction now U (since we moved up).\n> \n> Then tail is removed, so (1,5) is removed, but food is there, so when tail moves, the food is exposed at (1,5), since snake leaves it.\n> \n> Then (1,5) has food with L=5, now L=4 after turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if go L to (3,5), new head (3,5), direction L, tail removed, (1,5) exposed.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,3) and (6,2).\n> \n> (5,3) is currently occupied by body, so it can be eaten only if that body moves away.\n> \n> The body at (5,3) is index 5. The snake segments: let's list positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,5)\n> \n> 1: (5,5)\n> \n> 2: (6,5)\n> \n> 3: (6,4)\n> \n> 4: (6,3)  // this is above (6,2) food? (6,3) is y=3, (6,2) is y=2, so below.\n> \n> 5: (5,3)  // food at (5,3), but occupied\n> \n> 6: (5,4)\n> \n> 7: (4,4)\n> \n> 8: (3,4)\n> \n> 9: (2,4)\n> \n> 10: (1,4)\n> \n> 11: tail (1,5)\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is index 5, which is a body segment. When the snake moves, this segment will move only if the parts before it move.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the one before it.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves to a new position, segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, tail is removed.\n> \n> But segment 5 at (5,3) will move only if the segments before it cause it to move.\n> \n> Since the snake is continuous, when head moves, all segments shift, so segment 5 will move to where segment 4 was, etc.\n> \n> After one move, if no food eaten, head new pos, segment 1 to (4,5), segment 2 to (5,5), segment 3 to (6,5), segment 4 to (6,4), segment 5 to (6,3), segment 6 to (5,3)?

Snake positions: segment 7 is (5,3), and food is at (5,3) with life span 6. But the snake is already on (5,3)? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake segments:\n> \n> - (3,5) head\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,5)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,3)  <--- this is segment 7\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (1,4) tail\n> \n> Food is at (5,3), which is occupied by segment 7. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5) is not occupied by snake currently; (1,5) is empty? Let's see occupied cells.\n> \n> Cells occupied by snake: all positions listed: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n> \n> Food at (1,5): (1,5) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by segment 7.\n> \n> (6,2) is not occupied, it's below (6,3).\n> \n> (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,5), direction left. So from (3,5), possible moves: since direction is left, I can move left, up, down, but not right because that would be reverse, but reverse is not allowed only if it's the opposite direction immediately. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so I cannot move right (R) on this turn.\n> \n> Possible actions from (3,5):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,5)  (x-1,y)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,6)  (x,y+1)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4)  (x,y-1)\n> \n> But (3,4) is occupied by segment 10, which is part of the body. Moving there would cause collision, since it's not the tail in a way that allows it.\n> \n> Rule: deadly collisions include body collision, but you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> So, let's see what the tail is.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,4). After the next move, the tail will move to where? When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> But for collision: head touches any body segment except that if it moves to the current tail position, it might be ok if the tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, as long as it's only the tail and not other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (2,5): is (2,5) occupied? Snake positions: (2,4) is segment 11, (1,4) tail. (2,5) is not listed, so should be free? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Occupied: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — that's all 12.\n> \n> (2,5) is not occupied, so moving L to (2,5) should be safe.\n> \n> - U to (3,6): (3,6) — y=6, but border walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=7 is wall, y=6 is within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 or x=7.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so (3,6) is y=6, which is not 7, so it should be free? But is it occupied? Not in snake positions, so probably free.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 to 7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, meaning cells like (x,0) and (x,7) for all x are walls. Similarly x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle (5,6).\n> \n> So (3,6): x=3,y=6, not border, not obstacle, not occupied by snake, so free.\n> \n> - D to (3,4): (3,4) is occupied by segment 10, which is (3,4). Now, is this the tail? No, tail is (1,4), segment 12. (3,4) is segment 10, not tail. So moving to (3,4) would collide with body, deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, down is not possible.\n> \n> Also, right is not possible because of no instant reverse; current direction left, so cannot move right.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5): Left to (2,5), Up to (3,6), or Down but down is occupied, so only Left or Up.\n> \n> Down to (3,4) is occupied, so invalid.\n> \n> So only L or U.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns to maximize score.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,5): value +1, life span 4, so at turn 50, life span 4, meaning it disappears after turn 53? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, including current.\n> \n> So for food at (1,5), life span 4 at turn 50. After turn 50, if not eaten, life span becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then gone after turn 53. So it can be eaten on turns 50,51,52,53? When is it available?\n> \n> At the start of turn, food with life span >0 is present. When snake moves to it, it eats if available.\n> \n> At turn t, food with life span L will be present if L > 0. After the turn, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for (1,5) at turn 50, L=4, present. After turn 50, L=3, still present if not eaten, and so on, until after turn 53, L=0, not present.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) L=6, present until after turn 55? Turn 50 L=6, after turn 50 L=5, ..., after turn 55 L=0, gone. So can be eaten on turns 50 to 55.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently occupied by snake segment, so cannot be eaten now. Only when the snake moves away and head comes later.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) L=9, present until after turn 58.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> First, current turn t=50, head at (3,5), possible actions: L or U.\n> \n> If I go L to (2,5), or U to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, I should consider the food at (1,5), which is close. (1,5) is adjacent to (2,5) or to (1,4), but (1,4) is tail.\n> \n> If I go to (2,5), then from there I can go to (1,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But let's see the risks.\n> \n> Also, there is a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (1,4), and food is at (1,5), which is not on the tail, it's above it.\n> \n> The food is at (1,5), tail is at (1,4), so different cells.\n> \n> So if I eat (1,5), it should be fine, no immediate danger from that, since it's not on the tail cell.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, but here food is not on tail, so when I eat, I grow, so the new tail will be the old tail, but since I eat at (1,5), which is not tail, it should be ok.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 50, I move L to (2,5).\n> \n> Then head to (2,5), tail moves from (1,4) to? When head moves to (2,5), the snake: new head at (2,5), then body: old head (3,5) becomes segment 2, and so on, tail (1,4) moves off, so new tail is (2,4)?

It's turn 51, and I'm the snake. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So, walls are at all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and also (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (2,5), and it's moving left (L).

Let me list these in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Then: (3,5)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,5)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,4)\n> \n> The snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 3. So, it disappears after 3 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 51, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 53? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown N, available\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1, available if N-1 > 0\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + (N-1): countdown 1, available\n> \n> - Turn t + N: disappeared\n> \n> So for food at (1,5) with life span 3 at turn 51: available on turn 51, 52, 53.

Disappears after turn 55.\n> \n> Turn t with life span L: available for L turns, from t to t+L-1 inclusive? Better to think: it disappears after turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> Standard: if life span N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 on next turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So it is present for N turns, starting from turn t.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is N, meaning it has N turns left including current, so it will be gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, turn 51, life span 3: it is present on turn 51 (countdown 3), turn 52 (countdown 2), turn 53 (countdown 1), and gone on turn 54.

So from (2,5), possible moves: since moving left, I cannot move right instantly (no instant reverse), so I can move U, D, L, but not R.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move R next.\n> \n> Possible actions: U (up, to (2,6)? y+1 is up? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> The move: U (x,y+1) so up increases y.\n> \n> In grid, typically y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row, I assume.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (2,6)\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (2,4)\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (1,5)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (3,5) but cannot, because reverse.\n> \n> Cannot move to (3,5) since it's the body segment directly behind head? (3,5) is the second segment.\n> \n> But the rule is no instant reverse, meaning I cannot go directly opposite to current direction. Current is L, so cannot go R.\n> \n> But (3,5) is occupied by the body, so I cannot move there anyway, but even if empty, I couldn't go right because of no reverse.\n> \n> Now, check possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,6)\n> \n> - D: to (2,4)\n> \n> - L: to (1,5)\n> \n> Now, what about walls? (2,6): is it a wall? Walls are borders x=0,7 or y=0,7. (2,6) has x=2, y=6, not border, so ok, no wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), which is not (2,6), so ok.\n> \n> (2,4): x=2,y=4, not border, no obstacle.\n> \n> (1,5): x=1,y=5, not border, no obstacle.\n> \n> But I need to check if these cells are occupied by body or not.\n> \n> Body positions: let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (2,6) is not in this list, so empty.\n> \n> - (2,4) is in the list, it's the tail segment.\n> \n> - (1,5) is not in list, empty.\n> \n> But (2,4) is occupied by the tail. Now, can I move to the tail? The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (2,4) is possible, because the tail will move away, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to empty cells is fine.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,5) is a food position. If I move L to (1,5), I eat it.\n> \n> (5,3) is food, but I'm not near it.\n> \n> (6,2) is food.\n> \n> But I'm at (2,5), so only (1,5) is adjacent.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's plan possible actions for turn 51.\n> \n> Options: U, D, L.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,5), I eat the food there.

Head is at (2,5), so adjacent vertically? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,5) and (2,4) are adjacent (down).\n> \n> But the food is at (1,5), not at tail. Tail is at (2,4), which has no food mentioned. Food is only at (1,5), (5,3), (6,2).\n> \n> (2,4) is snake body, not food, so no issue.\n> \n> If I move to (1,5), I eat the food, so length increases. New head at (1,5), then the tail will stay or move? When I eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, I think? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move; you add a segment.\n> \n> The rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when eaten, snake grows, meaning the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But in terms of movement, when you move to a food cell, you eat it and grow.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (1,5), the snake positions: head at (1,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes body, and so on, up to tail at (2,4), but since you ate, you add a segment, so the tail stays at (2,4) for this turn? Let's think.\n> \n> Initial positions: [ (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,4) ]\n> \n> After moving left to (1,5): head moves to (1,5), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so new positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ] — now 13 segments, tail still at (2,4).\n> \n> Then next turn, when I move, the tail will move, depending on the direction.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 51, if I move L, I eat the food at (1,5).\n> \n> Now, life span of that food is 3, so it will disappear after turn 53, but I'm eating it now, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, other moves: if I move U to (2,6), no food, so snake moves, head to (2,6), tail moves to the next segment. Since no eat, tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, move D to (2,4), which is the tail cell. Since I move to tail, and no food there (I assume, since not listed), so no eat, and since tail moves, it's ok, head to (2,4), tail moves to, say, (3,4) or something.\n> \n> If I move to (2,4), which is the current tail, and there is no food there, so I just move, head to (2,4), and the tail moves forward, so the segment that was tail (2,4) is now head, and the previous tail-1 becomes new tail? Positions: current [H: (2,5), ..., T: (2,4)]\n> \n> After moving down to (2,4): since no food, head moves to (2,4), and tail moves off the last position. So the new positions: head at (2,4), then the previous (2,5) becomes second segment? Standard movement: when no eat, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [ (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ] — tail at (3,4), length 12, same as before.\n> \n> (2,4) was tail, now head is at (2,4), so the segment (2,4) is now head, and we remove the old tail, which was (2,4), but it's the same cell? I think I confused.\n> \n> Positions list: let's index them.\n> \n> Segments: 0: head (2,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (3,4), 11: tail (2,4)\n> \n> After moving down to (2,4): new head position (2,4). Since no food eaten, we remove the tail, which is (2,4). But (2,4) is the new head, and we remove the old tail which is also (2,4)? That can't be.\n> \n> Problem: when head moves to the tail cell, and no food, it should be ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: the head moves to the cell that was occupied by tail. At that moment, the tail is still there, but when head moves in, tail moves out simultaneously? The rule says: \"the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, effectively, for collision, since tail moves, it's not occupied when head arrives.\n> \n> Similarly, in movement: head moves to new cell, and tail is removed from its cell.\n> \n> So if head moves to (2,4), which is the current tail position, but since tail moves away, the cell (2,4) is vacated by tail and occupied by head, so it's fine.\n> \n> New positions: head at (2,4), then the body segments: from previous head to second last, so (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) — and tail was (2,4) but removed, so new tail is (3,4)? Let's list: positions after move: [new head: (2,4), then previous segment 0: (2,5), segment 1: (3,5), ..., segment 10: (3,4)] so segments: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) — and (3,4) is new tail, since we removed the old tail (2,4).\n> \n> Old tail was (2,4), which is now head, so we don't have a duplicate.\n> \n> Snake length remains 12.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> Back to turn 51 choices.\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) has only 3 turns life, including current, so I should eat it soon or it disappears.\n> \n> But I can eat it now by moving L.\n> \n> However, I must consider risks.\n> \n> Also, other food: (5,3) and (6,2) have longer life, 5 and 8 turns.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently occupied by the snake body?

The head is at (1,5), and it's moving left, so from (1,5), moving left would go to (0,5), but x=0 is a wall, so that would be a collision. Current head direction is L, meaning left, so from (1,5), moving left would go to (0,5), which is a border wall, so it's invalid. But the snake must be able to move, so I need to see possible moves.\n> \n> The head direction is given as L, but that might be the current direction, but for the next move, I can choose a different direction except the opposite. Since it's moving left, I cannot move right instantly, but I can move up, down, or continue left, but left is into wall.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.

Segment 1 is the neck, so it's part of the body and doesn't move immediately; only the tail moves after the head moves.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n> \n> But when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it collides.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Tail is (2,4). So moving to (2,5) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (0,5) is wall collision.\n> \n> Now, moving up to (1,6): is this free?

Format is (x,y, life_span, value), I think. It says (5,3,4,1) so (x,y, life_span, value), and value is 1 for all, so all positive food? Value=1, but it says positive food or negative, here all value=1, so all positive? But life_span given.\n> \n> Food: (5,3) with life=4, value=1; (6,2) with life=7, value=1; (5,2) with life=10, value=1. All value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> But (5,3) is occupied by segment 8, which is (5,3) in snake positions. Segment 8 is (5,3), and there is food at (5,3), but since it's under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (5,3) has food, but snake segment is there, so it's covered.\n> \n> Now back to possible moves from head (1,5):\n> \n> - Up: (1,6) - empty, no wall, no snake\n> \n> - Down: (1,4) - empty, no wall, no snake\n> \n> - Left: (0,5) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,5) - occupied by segment 1, body, collision\n> \n> So only possible moves are Up or Down.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, but since I'm choosing action, I can choose U or D, but not R because R is opposite to L? No.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to get to (1,5). So for the next move, from (1,5), I cannot move right (opposite to left), so R is forbidden.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible actions are U or D.\n> \n> I must choose between Up or Down for turn 52.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, and internal (5,6).\n> \n> Snake: let's plot for clarity.\n> \n> Row y=5: x=1 to x=6 occupied: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> Then at (6,5) it goes down to (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Then from (6,3) to (5,3), then up to (5,4), then left to (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> So tail at (2,4)\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (5,3) - but occupied by snake segment 8, so food is there but covered.\n> \n> - (6,2) - free?

Let's see: life_span decreases every turn, so at turn 52, life=4, after turn 52 it becomes 3, then turn 53:2, turn 54:1, turn 55:0, so disappears at turn 55? Or after turn 55?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food with life_span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span is L, then after turn t, it decreases to L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears at that point.\n> \n> Typically, when life_span becomes 0, it disappears, so for (5,3) at turn 52, life=4, so:\n> \n> - After turn 52, life=3\n> \n> - After turn 53, life=2\n> \n> - After turn 54, life=1\n> \n> - After turn 55, life=0, disappears, so not available from turn 56 onwards.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life=7 at turn 52, so disappears after turn 52+6=58?

Currently occupied by the snake's body (segment 9), so cannot be eaten immediately. Requires the snake to vacate (5,3) first, which is unlikely within its remaining life span.\n2. **(6,2)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 6 (must be eaten by Turn 58). Not urgent.\n3. **(5,2)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 9 (must be eaten by Turn 61). Not urgent.\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (5,3) is not safely reachable within its life span (it will always be occupied or cause a collision if eaten). \n- The other food (6,2) and (5,2) are not urgent, so we should prioritize moving toward them while avoiding collisions.\n- From (1,4), the valid moves are **Down (D)** to (1,3) or **Right (R)** to (2,4).\n  - Moving **Right (R)** to (2,4) is better because it starts moving the snake eastward toward the other food positions (6,2) and (5,2), which are in the eastern part of the grid.\n  - Moving **Down (D)** to (1,3) would take the snake south, away from the food, which is less efficient.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 53, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells go from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning we can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then body segments: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). That's 13 segments.

So for (5,3), life_span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns, including turn 53, so it will be gone by turn 56. Similarly, (6,2) has life_span 6, so gone by turn 59, and (5,2) life_span 9, gone by turn 62.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (1,4), moving down. Down direction means last move was down to (1,4) from (1,5)? Positions: head is (1,4), and next is (1,5), which is above it, so yes, moving down to (1,4) from (1,5). Since head direction is D, and positions show head at (1,4) with (1,5) behind, so it was moving down to (1,4).\n> \n> Now, from (1,4), I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (1,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,5) – but (1,5) is occupied by the second segment of the snake.

(1,5) is the second segment, so if I move up to (1,5), head would be at (1,5), but that cell is occupied by the body, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Check: not wall, and not in body positions? Body has (2,5), (3,5), etc., but (2,4) not listed, so should be empty.

Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, after the turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (5,3): at turn 53, L=3. After turn 53, L=2. After turn 54, L=1. After turn 55, L=0, so it disappears and cannot be eaten on turn 56. So must be eaten on or before turn 55.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): L=6 at turn 53. After turn 53, L=5; ... up to after turn 58, L=0, disappear before turn 59. Last eat on turn 58.\n> \n> (5,2): L=9, last eat on turn 61? Turn 53 to 61 is 9 turns? Turn 53: L=9, after turn 53: L=8, ..., after turn 61: L=0?

So can be eaten up to turn 61.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is urgent, only 3 turns left to eat it.\n> \n> But (5,3) is occupied? Look at snake positions: (5,3) is the 10th segment? Positions: index 0: (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,4), 11: (4,4), 12: (3,4) — tail.\n> \n> So (5,3) is segment 9, occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) is on a body segment.

The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,3), it's currently under segment 9. To eat it, we need the snake to move so that (5,3) is vacated, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> But when we move, the body also moves. Let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, (5,3) is not tail; tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), can move to (1,3) or (2,4).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6?

The food is under it, but since the body is still there, it can't be eaten yet. To eat the food at (5,3), we need that cell to be vacated, meaning the snake must move so that no segment is on (5,3) when the head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move right to (2,4), let's see what happens.\n> \n> Move right to (2,4): new head (2,4)\n> \n> New S[1] = old S[0] = (1,4)\n> \n> New S[2] = old S[1] = (1,5)\n> \n> New S[3] = old S[2] = (2,5)\n> \n> New S[4] = old S[3] = (3,5)\n> \n> New S[5] = old S[4] = (4,5)\n> \n> New S[6] = old S[5] = (5,5)\n> \n> New S[7] = old S[6] = (6,5)\n> \n> New S[8] = old S[7] = (6,4)\n> \n> New S[9] = old S[8] = (6,3)\n> \n> New S[10] = old S[9] = (5,3)  // still occupied\n> \n> New S[11] = old S[10] = (5,4)\n> \n> New S[12] = old S[11] = (4,4)  // new tail, (3,4) vacated\n> \n> (5,3) still occupied.\n> \n> So in both cases, after one move, (5,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (5,3), we need the segment currently on it to move away and not be replaced immediately.\n> \n> Currently, S[9] is at (5,3).

It's turn 53, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells go from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning we can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then body segments: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). That's 13 segments. Head direction is Down, which is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life_span 3\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life_span 6\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1, life_span 9\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1, and no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life_span means how many turns left before it disappears, including the current turn. So for (5,3), life_span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns, including turn 53, so it will be gone by turn 56. Similarly, (6,2) has life_span 6, so gone by turn 59, and (5,2) life_span 9, gone by turn 62.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (1,4), moving down. Down direction means last move was down to (1,4) from (1,5)? Positions: head is (1,4), and next is (1,5), which is above it, so yes, moving down to (1,4) from (1,5). Since head direction is D, and positions show head at (1,4) with (1,5) behind, so it was moving down to (1,4).\n> \n> Now, from (1,4), I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (1,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,5) – but (1,5) is occupied by the second segment of the snake. Is that a collision? Body collision: head touches any body segment. (1,5) is the second segment, so if I move up to (1,5), head would be at (1,5), but that cell is occupied by the body, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body cell is deadly unless it's the tail, and even then, it might be risky if not timed right.\n> \n> In this case, (1,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,4). Positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] so tail is (3,4).\n> \n> (1,5) is the second segment, so moving to (1,5) would cause collision because it's a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Similarly, down: to (1,3) – y=3, which is within bounds, but let's check if it's occupied or wall.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (1,3) is x=1, y=3, not wall. Also, no obstacles mentioned except (5,6), which is not here. So (1,3) should be empty? But need to check if any body or food there.\n> \n> Body positions: from list, (1,3) not in positions, so probably empty.\n> \n> Food: (5,3), (6,2), (5,2) – not (1,3), so empty.\n> \n> Left: to (0,4) – x=0 is wall, so cannot move left.\n> \n> Right: to (2,4) – x=2, y=4. Check: not wall, and not in body positions? Body has (2,5), (3,5), etc., but (2,4) not listed, so should be empty. Food not there.\n> \n> Now, current head direction is D, so I cannot instantly reverse to U, because no instant reverse. Reverse of D is U, so I cannot move up immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (1,4), with head direction D, I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> L is left, to (0,4) which is wall, so impossible.\n> \n> R is right, to (2,4), possible.\n> \n> D is down, to (1,3), possible.\n> \n> U is up, but reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible moves are Down or Right.\n> \n> Down to (1,3) or Right to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's understand the food situation.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (5,3) with life_span 3, so must be eaten by turn 55 (since turn 53,54,55; after turn 55, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 55).\n> \n> Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 53, life_span=3, meaning after 3 turns it vanishes. So:\n> \n> - After turn 53, life_span becomes 2\n> \n> - After turn 54, life_span becomes 1\n> \n> - After turn 55, life_span becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 56? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, after the turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (5,3): at turn 53, L=3. After turn 53, L=2. After turn 54, L=1. After turn 55, L=0, so it disappears and cannot be eaten on turn 56. So must be eaten on or before turn 55.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): L=6 at turn 53. After turn 53, L=5; ... up to after turn 58, L=0, disappear before turn 59. Last eat on turn 58.\n> \n> (5,2): L=9, last eat on turn 61? Turn 53 to 61 is 9 turns? Turn 53: L=9, after turn 53: L=8, ..., after turn 61: L=0? Let's count:\n> \n> Start turn 53, L=9\n> \n> After turn 53: L=8\n> \n> After turn 54: L=7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 61: L=0, so disappears before turn 62. So can be eaten up to turn 61.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is urgent, only 3 turns left to eat it.\n> \n> But (5,3) is occupied? Look at snake positions: (5,3) is the 10th segment? Positions: index 0: (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,4), 11: (4,4), 12: (3,4) — tail.\n> \n> So (5,3) is segment 9, occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) is on a body segment. Can it be eaten?\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n> 1. The body moves away, and\n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,3), it's currently under segment 9. To eat it, we need the snake to move so that (5,3) is vacated, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> But when we move, the body also moves. Let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, (5,3) is not tail; tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), can move to (1,3) or (2,4).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are accessible, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is within bounds.\n> \n> Now, snake: head (1,4), body down to (1,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), up to (5,4), left to (4,4), etc. Let's list positions in order:\n> \n> - (1,4) head\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (2,5)\n> \n> - (3,5)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,5)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,3)  <-- food here, but occupied\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (3,4) tail\n> \n> So the snake is coiled; from (1,4) down to (1,5), then east to (6,5), then south to (6,3), then west to (5,3), then north to (5,4), then west to (4,4), and (3,4).\n> \n> Food at (5,3), which is occupied, (6,2), and (5,2).\n> \n> (6,2) is south of (6,3), and (5,2) is south of (5,3).\n> \n> Since (5,3) has food but is occupied, we need to move the snake so that (5,3) is freed.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 53, when we move, the snake will move: head to new position, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but (5,3) is not tail; it's segment 9.\n> \n> When snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail (3,4) will be removed, and new position added at head.\n> \n> So after one move, the body positions shift.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (1,3), then new head (1,3), body: (1,4) becomes new segment 1, then (1,5) segment 2, ..., up to (4,4) becomes new segment 12, and tail (3,4) is gone, so (5,3) is still occupied, but by a different segment?

S[i] will become the tail after (12-i) moves, because each move, the tail index decreases by 1 relative to the head.\n> \n> After m moves, the segment that was at position i will be at position i+m, and when i+m > length, it is gone, but since length is fixed, after m moves, the current S[i] will be at position i-m if we think of the tail.\n> \n> After m moves, the current S[i] will be at position S[i-m] if i-m >=0, else it is removed.\n> \n> For example, after 0 moves, S[9] at (5,3)\n> \n> After 1 move, S[9] is now at position S[8] of new, so new S[8] at (6,3), and (5,3) has new S[10]\n> \n> After 2 moves, new S[9] at (6,3) for that state, etc.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) will be occupied until the segment that is on it is the tail and moves away.\n> \n> Currently, S[9] is on (5,3), and S[9] will become the tail after 3 moves, since tail is S[12], so after 3 moves, S[9] will be the tail.\n> \n> After 3 moves:\n> \n> - After 1 move: S[9] moves to S[8] position, so not tail.\n> \n> - After 2 moves: S[9] moves to S[7] position, etc.\n> \n> After m moves, the current S[k] will be at position S[k-m] in the new snake, and when k-m = 12, it becomes the tail.\n> \n> For S[9], when 9 - m = 12? 9 - m = 12 implies m = -3, not possible.\n> \n> Better to think: the index from tail.\n> \n> Current tail is S[12], so S[9] is 3 positions from tail (S[12], S[11], S[10], S[9]).\n> \n> So S[9] is the 4th segment from tail? Positions: S[12] tail, S[11], S[10], S[9] is fourth from tail.\n> \n> Distance to tail: S[9] to tail is 3 steps: S[9] to S[10] to S[11] to S[12].\n> \n> So after 3 moves, S[9] will be the tail, because each move, the tail moves forward, so the segment that was S[9] will be S[12] after 3 moves.\n> \n> After 1 move: S[9] becomes S[10] of new snake (since indices shift, new S[10] is old S[9])\n> \n> After 2 moves: new S[11] is old S[9]\n> \n> After 3 moves: new S[12] is old S[9], so it becomes the tail.\n> \n> And at that point, when it moves from (5,3), it will vacate the cell.\n> \n> But only if it doesn't grow.\n> \n> Since we're not eating, after 3 moves, the current S[9] will be the tail at (5,3), and when it moves, (5,3) is vacated.\n> \n> But the position may change.\n> \n> Currently S[9] is at (5,3). After moves, when it becomes tail, it might be at a different position if the snake moves.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) may not be where the tail is after 3 moves.\n> \n> To have (5,3) vacated, we need the tail to be at (5,3) and then move away.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (3,4), and (5,3) is occupied by S[9].\n> \n> The tail will move to (4,4) after one move, then to (5,4) after two moves, then to (5,3) after three moves?

It's the 11th segment in the list: positions are (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So (5,3) is the 12th? Let's index: position 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (6,5), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> So (5,3) is position 11, which is not the head or tail; it's a body segment. But there's food at (5,3) with life span 1. According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But it's under the snake body now.\n> \n> Head is at (2,3), moving Down. Down means decreasing y, so from (2,3) down would be to (2,2), but y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Moving Down from (2,3) to (2,2) is possible? (2,2) is within 1-6, and no wall mentioned except borders, so (2,2) should be free.\n> \n> But let's see possible moves from head (2,3):\n> \n> - Up: (2,4) but (2,4) is the second segment, so body collision. Cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (2,2) - is this free? Current snake positions: (2,3) head, (2,4), (1,4), etc. (2,2) not in positions, so should be free, unless wall or obstacle. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, obstacle (5,6). (2,2) is x=2,y=2, which is not border or obstacle, so free.\n> \n> - Left: (1,3) - x=1,y=3. x=1 is not border? Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are inside. (1,3) not in snake positions? Positions: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), etc. (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (3,3) - not in positions, so free.\n> \n> But snake head direction is Down, so from Down, I cannot instantly reverse to Up. Reverse of Down is Up, so I cannot move Up next turn because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Current direction Down, so possible moves: not Up, so Down, Left, or Right.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) is under the body at (5,3), which is position 11. To eat it, the body must move away, but the snake moves one step per turn, so if the snake moves, the body will shift.\n> \n> Since food life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so only chance to eat it is this turn, but it's under body now, so head cannot move to it directly because body is there. Rule: food under body can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> But this turn, the body is at (5,3), so head cannot move to (5,3) this turn because it's occupied. Next turn, if the snake moves, the body will move, so the cell (5,3) might be free if the tail moves or something.\n> \n> After movement, the snake advances: head moves to new position, and tail moves forward, so the cell that was occupied might be freed.\n> \n> Currently, head at (2,3), tail at (5,4).\n> \n> If I move the head to a new position, say (2,2), then new head is (2,2), the body segments follow: segment 1 (2,4) becomes the new position for the second segment, but since head moved to (2,2), the second segment will be the old head position (2,3), and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2):\n> \n> - New positions: head (2,2), then body: (2,3) [old head], then (2,4) [was seg1], then (1,4) [was seg2], (1,5) [was seg3], (2,5) [was seg4], (3,5) [was seg5], (4,5) [was seg6], (5,5) [was seg7], (6,5) [was seg8], (6,4) [was seg9], (6,3) [was seg10], (5,3) [was seg11], and tail (5,4) was seg12, but when head moves, the tail moves off, so the new tail is the old seg11 or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1.\n> \n> Positions indexed from 0: head.\n> \n> After move, new head at new position, then segment 0 moves to new head, segment 1 moves to old position of segment 0, segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, ..., segment k moves to old position of segment k-1, and the last segment (tail) is removed if no growth, but if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> Since no food eaten yet, snake length remains same, so after move, tail position is abandoned.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (6,5), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,2), then:\n> \n> - New head: (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old seg1 (2,4)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old seg2 (1,4)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old seg3 (1,5)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old seg4 (2,5)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old seg5 (3,5)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old seg6 (4,5)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old seg7 (5,5)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old seg8 (6,5)\n> \n> - New segment 10: old seg9 (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 11: old seg10 (6,3)\n> \n> - New segment 12: old seg11 (5,3)  // this was the food position\n> \n> - The old tail (5,4) is abandoned, so not part of snake anymore.\n> \n> So after move, (5,3) is now occupied by segment 11, which is not the head. The food at (5,3) is still under the body, not accessible to head.\n> \n> Moreover, since life span is 1, after this turn, it disappears, so cannot be eaten later. So this food at (5,3) is impossible to eat because it's under the body and we can't free it in time. So I should ignore it; it's gone after this turn.\n> \n> Now, other food: (6,2), (5,2), (4,1)\n> \n> All with positive value.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,3), direction Down.\n> \n> Possible moves from here: since direction is Down, cannot go Up. So Down to (2,2), Left to (1,3), or Right to (3,3).\n> \n> (2,2) is free, as we saw.\n> \n> (1,3): let's check if occupied or wall. Walls: x=0 border, so x=1 is ok, y=3 ok. Not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (3,3): similarly, free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the grid layout.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so we can't go to x=0,7 or y=0,7. Internal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,6).\n> \n> Snake is long, 13 segments.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (6,2): value 1, life span 4, so disappears after turn 55+4=59, but countdown decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 55, life span 4, so it has 4 turns left: turn 55,56,57,58. After turn 58, it disappears, so must be eaten by turn 58.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2): life span 7, so from turn 55, lasts until turn 61 (55+6?

Rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn 55, life span 1 for (5,3), so it disappears after turn 55, meaning at the end of turn 55 or start of turn 56.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,2) life span 4 at turn 55: countdown 4, so decreases to 3 on turn 56, to 2 on 57, to 1 on 58, disappears after 58, so can be eaten on turns 55,56,57,58.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life span 7: can be eaten from turn 55 to 61 (since 55+6=61, disappears after 61).\n> \n> Turn 55: life span 7, after turn 55, life span 6, and so on, down to life span 1 on turn 61, disappears after turn 61.

It's turn 56, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y are walls, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,2), direction is D (down). Body segments: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].

Let's see the positions: from head to next segment: (2,2) to (2,3) — that's increasing y, so moving down? In grid coordinates, usually (0,0) is top-left, y increases down, x increases right. So (x,y) with y increasing down.\n> \n> Direction is given as D, which is down, so (x,y+1). Current head at (2,2), moving down would be to (2,3), but (2,3) is already a body segment. The snake positions list has (2,2) as head, then (2,3) as next, so the snake was moving down to get to (2,2) from previous? Positions are listed head first, so the head is at (2,2), and it came from (2,3)? Let's think about the direction.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), ...] so from (2,3) to (2,2) is moving up? That might be inconsistent with direction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning current direction is down. But from the positions, if head is at (2,2) and previous was (2,3), that would mean it moved from (2,3) to (2,2), which is up, but direction is down. I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> The head direction is the direction the snake is currently facing, meaning the direction it moved to get to the current head position. Or the direction it will move next? The rule says: \"Snake Head Direction: U/D/L/R\" and it's given as D.\n> \n> In the context, the head direction is the direction it is pointing, so for the next move, it can choose to go in that direction or change, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2)\n> \n> Head direction: D (down)\n> \n> So, from (2,2), moving down would be to (2,3).\n> \n> But (2,3) is occupied by the second segment of the snake body.

Indices: let's index from 0: head [0]=(3,2), [1]=(2,2), [2]=(2,3), [3]=(2,4), [4]=(1,4), [5]=(1,5), [6]=(2,5), [7]=(3,5), [8]=(4,5), [9]=(5,5), [10]=(6,5), [11]=(6,4), [12]=(6,3)\n> \n> After move to (4,2) without eating: new head [0]=(4,2), then [1] becomes previous head (3,2), [2] becomes previous [1]=(2,2), [3]=(2,3), ..., up to [12] becomes previous [11]=(6,4), and previous [12]=(6,3) is removed. So new snake: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)] — that's 13 positions? No: from 0 to 12 is 13, but after move, positions from 0 to 11 if no eat? Original has 13 segments, index 0 to 12.\n> \n> After move: new head at new position, then the body segments are the previous positions from index 0 to 11, but index 0 is now the first body segment at previous head position.\n> \n> New list: [0] = new position (4,2)\n> \n> [1] = previous [0] (3,2)\n> \n> [2] = previous [1] (2,2)\n> \n> [3] = previous [2] (2,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> [12] = previous [11] (6,4)\n> \n> And previous [12] (6,3) is gone, so now 12 segments. Length decreased by one because no food eaten? No, in snake game, when no food, the snake moves forward, length remains the same, but the tail moves, so the last position is removed.\n> \n> In terms of number of segments, if no food eaten, length constant, so after move, the snake has the same number of segments, but all positions shift.\n> \n> For example, from 13 segments, after move without eating: new head position, and the body consists of the first 12 positions of the previous list, but shifted.\n> \n> Previous positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P12\n> \n> After move to new cell Q (no food): new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P11\n> \n> So the tail P12 is removed, and now the snake has positions from Q to P11, which is 12 segments? Q and P0 to P11 is 1 + 12 = 13? P0 to P11 is 12 positions, plus Q, so 13 positions.\n> \n> P0 to P11 is indices 0 to 11, that's 12 positions, plus new head Q, so 13 positions.\n> \n> Similarly, P0 to P12 is 13 positions, indices 0 to 12.\n> \n> After move: new head at Q, then P0, P1, ..., P11. P0 to P11 is 12 positions, so new list: Q, P0, P1, ..., P11 — that's 13 positions? Q, then 12 positions P0 to P11, so 13 positions.\n> \n> But P12 is missing, so the new tail is P11, which was the second last.\n> \n> For example, previous tail was P12, after move, new tail is P11, so the tail moved from P12 to P11 position, but in terms of cell, P11 was occupied, now it's the tail.\n> \n> In this case, previous P11 was (6,4), P12 was (6,3)\n> \n> After move to (4,2): new head (4,2), then P0=(3,2), P1=(2,2), P2=(2,3), P3=(2,4), P4=(1,4), P5=(1,5), P6=(2,5), P7=(3,5), P8=(4,5), P9=(5,5), P10=(6,5), P11=(6,4) — so new positions: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> Now 13 positions, tail at (6,4)\n> \n> Previously tail was (6,3), now tail is (6,4), so it moved.\n> \n> If I eat food, then new positions: new head at food cell, then P0, P1, ..., P12, so length increases, tail remains at P12 for that turn, but since new segment added, the tail position doesn't change immediately.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, with eating, new head at food, then all previous positions including tail, so length+1.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> First, the food at (6,2) has only 3 turns left, so I should consider eating it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) has 5 turns, (4,1) has 8, so (6,2) is urgent.\n> \n> But is it safe to go for (6,2)?\n> \n> From (3,2), I can go right to (4,2) on turn 57.\n> \n> Then from there, to (5,2) on turn 58, which has food, so I eat it, length increases.\n> \n> Then from (5,2), I can go to (6,2) on turn 59 to eat it.\n> \n> But let's see the state after each move.\n> \n> First, turn 57: move options.\n> \n> I can move R to (4,2), U to (3,3), or D to (3,1).\n> \n> If I move R to (4,2) on turn 57:\n> \n> - No food, so snake moves: head to (4,2), body as above, tail now at (6,4)\n> \n> Food life spans decrease: (6,2) life span was 3, after turn 57, on turn 58 it will be 2.\n> \n> Similarly, others.\n> \n> Then on turn 58, from (4,2), I can move to (5,2), which has food.\n> \n> Move to (5,2): since (5,2) has food, I eat it, so snake grows.\n> \n> New head at (5,2), then previous positions: previous head (4,2) becomes body, and all segments, so new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — and since ate, no tail removal, so the previous tail (6,4) is still there, and a new segment is added?

So (3,2) is a body segment, so moving left to (3,2) would cause collision because after move, head is at (3,2), but that cell is occupied by the second segment, and since the snake moves, the body shifts, but at the moment of move, it's occupied.\n> \n> I think I need to simulate the move.\n> \n> At turn t, before move, snake occupies certain cells.\n> \n> When you choose a direction, head moves to new cell.\n> \n> If new cell is wall or body segment (except the tail segment), collision.\n> \n> If new cell is tail segment, then since tail moves, no collision, and snake grows if food eaten.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But for collision: only safe if moving to the tail cell.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,2), moving left to (3,2): (3,2) is currently occupied by the second segment, not tail.

No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start, snake occupies cells S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n> \n> You choose direction, head moves to new cell, say N.\n> \n> If N has food, you eat it, and the snake grows: so the new snake has head at N, then S0, S1, S2, ..., Sk.

Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=7 is wall, x=6 is not wall? Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So (6,2) is not wall, x=6 <7, y=2>0.\n> \n> But after moving, head at (6,2), body segments include (5,2), (4,2), etc., and (6,4) is part of body now.\n> \n> Is (6,2) occupied by body? Before moving, (6,2) is food, not body. Current body positions: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So (6,2) is not in the list, it's free, has food.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), the snake occupies (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (6,4). So (6,2) is head, and (5,2) is next, etc.\n> \n> Now, for collision: head at (6,2), is it touching body? The body cells are (5,2), (4,2), etc. (5,2) is adjacent to head at (6,2), but (5,2) is the segment right behind head, which is fine, as long as not overlapping, but in snake, head can be adjacent to the neck, no problem.\n> \n> Collision is if head moves to a cell occupied by any other body segment, not the immediate next one, since that will move away.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to (6,2), the cell (6,2) was not occupied before, except for food, but food is eaten. After move, (6,2) is head, and (5,2) is now the second segment, which was previously head, so no issue.\n> \n> Are there any body segments at (6,2)? No, before or after.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to (6,2), so no immediate danger.\n> \n> But there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (6,4), head is at (5,2), which is not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,2) and (6,4) are not adjacent; (5,2) to (6,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (6,2) would be right of (5,2), but tail is at (6,4), which is down from (6,2)? (6,2) to (6,4) is down 2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, (6,4) has no food; it's the tail position, not food.\n> \n> Food is at (6,2), which is being eaten.\n> \n> So eating (6,2) seems safe and beneficial.\n> \n> But life span is 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears, and I lose the opportunity.\n> \n> Now, other food: (4,1) and (1,2), both have higher life span, 6 and 9 turns.\n> \n> But since (6,2) is about to disappear, I should eat it if possible.\n> \n> Is there any risk?\n> \n> Current head direction is R, right, so moving right to (6,2) is allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since current direction is R, I can't move left (L) next turn, but this turn I can move right.\n> \n> Now, after eating, what next?\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), head at (6,2), direction was right, so now head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), or R to (7,2).\n> \n> But R to (7,2): x=7 is wall, so cannot move there, wall collision.\n> \n> L to (5,2): (5,2) is now the second segment, but after this move, when I move from (6,2), the body will shift.\n> \n> Let's think about next turn.\n> \n> Turn t=59: move R to (6,2), eat food, snake grows to 15 segments.\n> \n> Now turn t=60: head at (6,2), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,3)\n> \n> - D: (6,1)\n> \n> - L: (5,2) — but (5,2) is occupied by the second segment.

Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Walls at borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. But y=0 and y=7 are the bottom and top? Let's clarify coordinates. Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since head is at (6,1) and moving down to (6,2), which has a higher y-value? Moving down to (6,2) from (6,1) suggests that increasing y is down, so (0,0) is top-left, I think. Let's confirm.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), etc. If head is moving down to (6,2), that means from (6,1) to (6,2), so y increases downward. So (0,0) is top-left, (0,7) bottom-left, (7,0) top-right, (7,7) bottom-right.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 (left), x=7 (right), y=0 (top), y=7 (bottom). Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Food at (4,1), (1,2), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake head at (6,1), moving down.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head direction is D (down), I can move L (left), R (right), or D (down), but not U (up) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. The rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I can move L, R, or D.\n> \n> Now, let's see the surroundings of head at (6,1):\n> \n> - Down: to (6,2). But (6,2) is the second segment of the snake body. Moving there would cause a collision because it's part of the body. The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\" But there's an exception: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (6,2) is not the tail; tail is at (6,5). The snake positions are: [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n> \n> So (6,2) is the second position, which is a body segment, not the tail. Moving to (6,2) would cause head to touch body, so it's deadly. Cannot move down to (6,2).\n> \n> Left: to (5,1). Is this safe? Check if it's a wall or body. Walls: x=0,7; y=0,7. (5,1) is not a border wall. Internal obstacle is at (5,6), not (5,1). Body positions: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), etc. (5,1) is not in the snake positions, so it should be empty. So moving left to (5,1) is possible.\n> \n> Right: to (7,1). But x=7 is a wall, so cannot move right; it's a wall collision.\n> \n> Up: to (6,0). But y=0 is a wall, so cannot move up; also, it's opposite direction, but even if not, it's a wall.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,1) with direction D: L (left to (5,1)), or D (down to (6,2)) but that's body, not safe, or R (right to (7,1)) wall. So only possible safe move is L to (5,1).\n> \n> Is that right? D to (6,2) is occupied by body, so collision. U is not allowed and wall. R is wall. So only L to (5,1) is safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the tail: tail is at (6,5), which is not near, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (5,1), what happens? The snake head moves to (5,1), and the body follows, so the tail moves from (6,5) to the next position. Specifically, when the snake moves, the head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and the tail is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten yet, length remains the same, tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,1), which is empty, so no food, so tail (6,5) is removed, and the new positions become: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ..., up to (5,5), I think. Let's trace: original positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (5,1): new head at (5,1), then the first body segment is the old head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), and tail (6,5) is removed? No, the tail is removed only if no food eaten. Since no food, the last segment (tail) is removed, so the new snake is: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] and (6,5) is gone. Length is 14 now? Original was 15 positions, minus one for tail, so 14.\n> \n> Original snake positions have 15 segments: indices 0 to 14, head at 0, tail at 14.\n> \n> After move without eating, new positions: head new pos, then pos[0], pos[1], ..., up to pos[13], so 14 segments.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,5) is now the tail.\n> \n> Now, back to the move: at turn 61, I must move to (5,1) since it's the only safe move? But I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (4,1), which is adjacent to (5,1). (4,1) is left of (5,1), since x decreases left.\n> \n> From (5,1), I can go to (4,1) to eat the food, or other directions.\n> \n> But let's list all possible moves for the next few turns.\n> \n> First, at turn 61, only safe move is L to (5,1). So I have to do that.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (5,1), the head is at (5,1), direction was D, but now I moved left, so new direction is L (left).\n> \n> Now, turn 62: head at (5,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction L, I can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite).\n> \n> L: to (4,1) – this has food! (4,1) with value 1, life span 4. Since it's turn 61 now, after moving to (5,1) on turn 61, turn 62 is next.\n> \n> Turn 61: move to (5,1)\n> \n> Then turn 62: head at (5,1), direction L.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is still there, life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn 61, food at (4,1) has life span 4, so after turn 61, it decreases to 3, then turn 62 to 2, etc., disappearing after turn 64? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,1) with life span 4 at turn 61, that means at the end of turn 61, countdown decreases to 3; after turn 62, to 2; after turn 63, to 1; after turn 64, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 61,62,63,64, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> At turn 62, head at (5,1), I can move to (4,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> But is it safe? (4,1) is empty, not wall or body, so yes.\n> \n> If I eat it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> But I need to consider the tail reward danger.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I eat at (4,1) on turn 62.\n> \n> But at turn 62, moving to (4,1).\n> \n> Possible other moves from (5,1): U to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid. D to (5,2). Now, (5,2) is a body segment? Current positions after turn 61 move: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ... so (5,2) is the fourth segment, body, so moving down to (5,2) would cause collision, deadly.\n> \n> L to (4,1) is safe and has food.\n> \n> R to (6,1) but that would be right, opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, opposite is R, so cannot move R anyway.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (5,1) at turn 62: L to (4,1) or D to (5,2) but D to (5,2) is body, collision, so only L to (4,1) is safe.\n> \n> Therefore, at turn 62, I must move to (4,1) and eat the food.\n> \n> Then, after eating, snake grows: new head at (4,1), and the tail stays, so positions: head (4,1), then old head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), ..., up to tail (5,5), and since ate food, add new segment, but where? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it becomes longer.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1) and eating, new positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — and since ate food, we add a new segment at the end, so tail becomes (5,5) and new tail is added? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively growing by one.\n> \n> So positions: before move, snake was [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), ..., (5,5) ] 14 segments.\n> \n> After move: head to (4,1), so new head (4,1), then the old positions except the tail is not removed; instead, the tail stays and we add the new head position.\n> \n> So body: (5,1) becomes first body, (6,1) second, ..., up to (5,5) as the last body, and since ate, add a new segment at (5,5)? No.\n> \n> When you eat, after moving the head to food, you don't remove the tail, so the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] — 16 segments? Original 14, after move without eat would be 13, but with eat, it stays 14 and adds one, so 15 segments? I'm confused.\n> \n> Original before turn 61: 15 segments.\n> \n> Turn 61: move to (5,1) no eat, so new snake: 14 segments, positions from (5,1) to (5,5) minus the old tail (6,5), but earlier I listed [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] that's 15 positions? Let's count: 1.(5,1) head, 2.(6,1), 3.(6,2), 4.(5,2), 5.(4,2), 6.(3,2), 7.(2,2), 8.(2,3), 9.(2,4), 10.(1,4), 11.(1,5), 12.(2,5), 13.(3,5), 14.(4,5), 15.(5,5) tail. Yes, 15 segments? No: after turn 61 move without eat, it should have 14 segments because tail removed.\n> \n> Original turn 61 snake: 15 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to new position without eating, the new snake has the new head and all but the last segment of the old snake, so 14 segments.\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 14: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> After move to (5,1): new head (5,1), then old head becomes body: (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ..., up to (5,5), and (6,5) is removed. So positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — that's 15 positions? (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — yes, 15, but (6,5) is gone, and (5,5) was second last, now tail. Number of segments: from 0 to 14, 15 positions. But when you move without eating, you should have one less segment? I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves to a new cell without food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is left empty. So the number of segments remains the same, but the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the new positions are: new head position, followed by the old head position, then the old second position, and so on, up to the old second-to-last position. The old tail position is abandoned.\n> \n> So for a snake of length L, after moving without eating, it still has length L, with new head position, and the tail is now at what was the second-to-last position.\n> \n> In this case, old snake: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P14 with P0 head, P14 tail.\n> \n> After moving to new head position H, new positions: H, P0, P1, P2, ..., P13. P14 is abandoned, so new tail is at P13.\n> \n> Old positions: P0=(6,1), P1=(6,2), P2=(5,2), P3=(4,2), P4=(3,2), P5=(2,2), P6=(2,3), P7=(2,4), P8=(1,4), P9=(1,5), P10=(2,5), P11=(3,5), P12=(4,5), P13=(5,5), P14=(6,5)\n> \n> After move to (5,1) no eat: new head H=(5,1), then P0, P1, ..., P13: so (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — so positions from index 0 to 13 of old, with new head. P13 was (5,5), now tail. Length still 15? (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — that's 15 positions, but P14 is gone, and P13 is included. Indices: new P0 = (5,1), P1 = old P0 = (6,1), P2 = old P1 = (6,2), P3 = old P2 = (5,2), ..., up to P14 = old P13 = (5,5). Old P13 was (5,5), old P14 was (6,5) abandoned. So new snake has 15 segments, head (5,1), tail (5,5).\n> \n> But originally 15, after move no eat, should be same length. Yes, length unchanged.\n> \n> If eat, then when head moves to food, the tail does not move, so new positions: new head at food, then old head, then old P1, ..., up to old tail, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Back to turn 62.\n> \n> At turn 62, head at (5,1), direction L.\n> \n> Only safe move is L to (4,1), which has food.\n> \n> Move to (4,1), eat food, so snake grows.\n> \n> New head at (4,1), new direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Positions: new head (4,1), then old head (5,1), then old P1 (6,1), old P2 (6,2), ..., up to old tail (5,5), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position? No, when you eat, you don't remove the tail, so the new tail is the old tail, and you add a new segment at the end, but in terms of positions, it's like the tail stays, so the snake has an extra segment.\n> \n> After move: head to (4,1), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — and since ate, no removal, so 16 segments, tail at (5,5).\n> \n> New tail is (5,5), which was old tail.\n> \n> Now, turn 63: head at (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is eaten, so gone.\n> \n> Other food: (1,2) and (6,3).\n> \n> Life span: (1,2) life span 7 at turn 61, so at turn 63, it has decreased: turn 61:7, turn 62:6, turn 63:5, so 5 turns left.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) at turn 61:10, turn 62:9, turn 63:8.\n> \n> Now, from (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,1), U to (4,0), D to (4,2), R to (5,1) but R is opposite to L, so not allowed.\n> \n> U to (4,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (4,2): (4,2) is a body segment. Current positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ... (4,2) is the sixth segment, body, so moving down to (4,2) would collide, deadly.\n> \n> L to (3,1): is this safe? (3,1) not wall, not in snake positions? Snake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> (3,1) is not listed, so should be empty.

After move without eat: new head (3,1), then old head (4,1), old P1 (5,1), old P2 (6,1), ..., up to old P14 (4,5), old P15 was (5,5) abandoned. Old positions had 16 segments? After turn 62 eat, 16 segments.\n> \n> After turn 62: positions: H (4,1), B1 (5,1), B2 (6,1), B3 (6,2), B4 (5,2), B5 (4,2), B6 (3,2), B7 (2,2), B8 (2,3), B9 (2,4), B10 (1,4), B11 (1,5), B12 (2,5), B13 (3,5), B14 (4,5), B15 (5,5) tail.\n> \n> Turn 63: move to (3,1) no eat, so new head (3,1), then B1 (4,1), B2 (5,1), B3 (6,1), B4 (6,2), B5 (5,2), B6 (4,2), B7 (3,2), B8 (2,2), B9 (2,3), B10 (2,4), B11 (1,4), B12 (1,5), B13 (2,5), B14 (3,5), B15 (4,5) — B15 is (4,5), tail.

So it disappears after turn 64, meaning it can be eaten on turns 62, 63, or 64.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,1): value +1, life span 3 (can be eaten on turns 62,63,64)\n> \n> - (1,2): value +1, life span 6 (can be eaten on turns 62 to 67)\n> \n> - (6,3): value +1, life span 9 (can be eaten on turns 62 to 70)\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here. Good.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,1), moving left. So from (5,1), possible moves: since it was moving left, it can't instantly reverse to right. So possible directions: up, down, left (since not opposite), or right? Opposite of left is right, so it cannot move right immediately.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning it came from right to (5,1), so moving left. Next move, it can go U, D, or L, but not R, because R would be reverse.\n> \n> Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> From (5,1):\n> \n> - U: (5,2)\n> \n> - D: (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - L: (4,1)\n> \n> - R: (6,1) but R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R because of no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,0) is out of bound, invalid.\n> \n> Now, check what cells are occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> So head at (5,1), tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - U: (5,2) - but (5,2) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (5,2) is the fourth segment: indices: (5,1) head, (6,1) second, (6,2) third, (5,2) fourth. So (5,2) is part of body, so moving to (5,2) would cause collision with body. Deadly.\n> \n> - D: (5,0) - y=0 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (4,1) - now, (4,1) has food? Food at (4,1) is present. But is it safe to move there?\n> \n> First, check if (4,1) is occupied. Snake positions: (4,1) is not in the list. Snake: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), etc. (4,2) is there, but (4,1) is not. So (4,1) is empty except for food.\n> \n> But moving to (4,1) would eat the food if head moves there.\n> \n> Now, is there any risk? Also, need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> R is not possible due to reverse rule.\n> \n> So only possible moves are U, D, L. But U to (5,2) is body, collision. D to (5,0) is wall, invalid. So only L to (4,1) is possible? Is that right?\n> \n> What about other directions? U, D, L are the only options besides R, which is invalid.\n> \n> U: (5,2) is occupied by body segment at index 3: (5,2) is position, and it's the fourth element in list? List index 0: (5,1) head, index 1: (6,1), index 2: (6,2), index 3: (5,2), yes, so (5,2) is occupied. Moving there would collide.\n> \n> D: (5,0) y=0 wall.\n> \n> L: (4,1) - not occupied, and has food.\n> \n> But is L safe? Moving to (4,1) would eat the food, so snake grows, length increases by one.\n> \n> After moving, the tail moves only if no food eaten, but since food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so new head at (4,1), and the body extends, so the tail remains at (5,5) for now? When food is eaten, the snake grows, so the head moves to new position, and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat food, head moves to food cell, body follows, but tail stays in place, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Here, positions: after moving left to (4,1), head is now at (4,1), and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body segments shift: the old head (5,1) becomes new neck, and so on, down to tail (5,5) still there.\n> \n> But (5,1) is now part of body, so positions become: head (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), ..., up to (5,5), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell. If no food, tail moves off its cell. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so a new cell is added at tail, meaning the tail position stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So in this case, moving to (4,1) and eating food: new positions: head at (4,1), then the previous head (5,1) becomes first body segment, then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the tail end, so tail is now at (5,5) but we add a new cell, so the new tail would be where? The last segment was (5,5), and since tail doesn't move, we add a new segment at (5,5)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves forward, head goes to new cell. Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment that was at the tail position leaves it, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the tail segment is removed from its old position.\n> \n> If food eaten: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, but the tail segment stays, so a new segment is added at the tail position, meaning the snake grows by one, and the tail cell remains occupied.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to new cell without eating: new positions [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-1}] where newH is the new head position, and T is removed.\n> \n> After move with eating: new positions [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so the tail T stays, and newH added.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 15 segments: indices 0 to 14: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> After moving left to (4,1) and eating food: new head is (4,1), then the previous head (5,1) is now the first body segment, then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ..., all the way to (5,5), and since food eaten, we keep the tail, so the new positions are: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] so now 16 segments, tail still at (5,5).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves at turn 62.\n> \n> From (5,1), only L to (4,1) seems possible because U is body, D is wall.\n> \n> But is (4,1) safe? After moving, head at (4,1), and we need to see future moves.\n> \n> But for turn 62, I must choose an action.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider if there are other options. What about moving to other cells? But only L is possible? U and D are invalid, R is not allowed due to reverse. So only L is possible? But that would eat the food at (4,1).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders and (5,6).\n> \n> (5,1): head\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,2) - occupied by body (5,2) is in positions, index 3.\n> \n> - Down: (5,0) - y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (4,1) - not occupied, and has food.\n> \n> - Right: (6,1) - but (6,1) is occupied by body? Positions: (6,1) is the second segment, so occupied. Also, moving right would be opposite direction, which is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is L to (4,1).\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 62, I must move L to eat the food at (4,1).\n> \n> But the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead, but in this case, I have no choice; it's the only move.\n> \n> After eating, life span of that food was 3, but since eaten, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, after turn 62, snake positions: as above, head at (4,1), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> Head direction: since I moved L, new head direction is L.\n> \n> Now, turn 63: head at (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L (since not opposite, opposite would be R).\n> \n> U: (4,2) - but (4,2) is occupied? Positions: (4,2) is the sixth segment? New positions: index 0: (4,1) head, index 1: (5,1), index 2: (6,1), index 3: (6,2), index 4: (5,2), index 5: (4,2), etc. So (4,2) is index 5, which is body, occupied.\n> \n> D: (4,0) - y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> L: (3,1) - what is at (3,1)? Not a wall, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,2), (2,2), etc., but (3,1) not in list. Also, no food mentioned at (3,1), so empty.\n> \n> (3,1) might be a valid move.\n> \n> R: (5,1) - but (5,1) is occupied by body (index 1), and also R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so moving R would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2) occupied, invalid; D to (4,0) wall, invalid; L to (3,1) empty; R not allowed.\n> \n> So only L to (3,1) is possible.\n> \n> Then move to (3,1), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves.\n> \n> After moving to (3,1), no food, so head to (3,1), body shifts: (4,1) becomes body, (5,1), (6,1), etc., and tail (5,5) is removed?

From 16 to 15? Let's count.\n> \n> Before move: 16 positions.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, so the last position (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: head at (3,1), then the previous positions from index 0 to 14 become the body, but index 0 was head, now it's the first body segment at (4,1), index 1 at (5,1), up to index 14 at (4,5)?

The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), direction L (left), so it's moving left. The positions are: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. That's 16 segments, so the snake is long.\n> \n> Food: two items.\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 5. Since current turn is 63, it will disappear after turn 67 (63 + 5 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns. Let's clarify: \"life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> For food at (1,2): life span 5, so it will be there for 5 more turns, including turn 63. So it disappears after turn 67? Countdown: on turn 63, life span=5; turn 64, life span=4; ... turn 67, life span=1; then on turn 68, it should be gone. But \"disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N moves or after N full turns?\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on the turn when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before that turn? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn T, the food has life_span L. After the move on turn T, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it disappears after the move. Similarly, if L=5 on turn 63, after turn 63 move, L=4; after turn 64, L=3; ... after turn 67 move, L=0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 63 to 67 inclusive. On turn 68, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food: (6,3) with life span 8, so available from turn 63 to 70.\n> \n> Values: both are +1, positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head direction is L, so it's moving left. Current head at (4,1), moving left to (3,1)? But positions show head at (4,1), and next segment is (5,1), which is right, so since head is at (4,1) and direction L, it must have come from the right, so previous position was (5,1), now head at (4,1), moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because no instant reverse. So from (4,1), moving L would go to (3,1), U to (4,2), D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so D is invalid.\n> \n> Grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,0) is wall, can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,6), not relevant now.\n> \n> So from head position (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (3,1)\n> \n> - U to (4,2)\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) but y=0 wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (5,1), but (5,1) is the second segment, which is body. But can I move to a body segment? Generally, body collision is deadly, except for the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So moving to (5,1) would cause head to touch body segment at (5,1), which is not the tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving R to (5,1) is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D to (4,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (4,1) are:\n> \n> - L to (3,1): is (3,1) free? Let's see the positions: (3,1) is not in the snake positions. Positions are: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), etc. So (3,1) is empty, I think. Grid has walls and obstacles, but (3,1) is not wall, not obstacle, and not occupied by snake? Snake has (3,2), but not (3,1), so (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> - U to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by the snake body. Positions: after head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) is the fifth segment. So (4,2) is body, not tail. If I move to (4,2), head would be at (4,2) which is occupied by body segment, so collision.\n> \n> Unless after move, that segment moves. But when the head moves, the body follows, but the head moves first to a new cell, then each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, then the tail moves away from its position if no growth.\n> \n> But in terms of collision: if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it collides unless that segment is the tail and will move.\n> \n> Here, (4,2) is not the tail; tail is (5,5). So moving to (4,2) would cause collision because (4,2) is occupied and will still be occupied after move? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start, positions: cell (4,2) has a body segment.\n> \n> If I move head up to (4,2), but (4,2) is already occupied, so as soon as head moves there, it collides with the body segment that is there.\n> \n> After the move, the segment that was at (4,2) will move to the next position, but at the time of move, (4,2) is occupied, so moving there causes immediate collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" and \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for non-tail segments, moving into them causes collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving U to (4,2) is invalid because (4,2) is a body segment (not tail).\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> What about (3,1)? Is it occupied? Snake positions: let's list all: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So (3,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Also, not wall: walls are borders and (5,6), so (3,1) is playable.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (3,1).

But according to rules, moving into a body segment is deadly, except for the tail, because when you move, the tail also moves.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and you move into it, it might be ok because tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's safe.\n> \n> Otherwise, if it moves to a body segment that is not the tail, collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is position 7, which is not the tail. Tail is at (4,5). So (3,2) is a body segment, and if head moves to (3,2), it will collide with the body segment there, since that segment won't move away immediately; only the tail moves when the snake moves forward.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, unless that segment is the tail, it will cause collision because the body segment is still there when head arrives.\n> \n> Specifically: at the moment of movement, if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the current tail, collision. If it's the tail, then since tail moves, it's ok.\n> \n> Here, (3,2) is occupied by segment 7, which is not tail, so moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (2,1): is (2,1) occupied? Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), but not (2,1), so free. Also, walls: x=0 is wall, but (2,1) is x=2,y=1, which is within playable area, no wall.\n> \n> Playable x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (5,6).\n> \n> (2,1) is x=2,y=1, should be free.\n> \n> So from (3,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (2,1): free cell, safe\n> \n> - U to (3,2): occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (3,0) wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: opposite direction, invalid\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (2,1).\n> \n> Is that right? U to (3,2) is invalid because it's a body segment.\n> \n> But let's confirm snake positions: segments are (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), etc. (3,2) is another segment.\n> \n> After head, position 1 is (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), etc.\n> \n> So (3,2) is a separate cell, occupied now.\n> \n> When head moves, if it moves to (3,2), at that moment, (3,2) has a body segment, so head collides with it.\n> \n> Yes, so invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move from current position is L to (2,1).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move L to (2,1), then from there.\n> \n> But let's see the food and plan.\n> \n> First, food at (1,2) is close, life span 4, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> (1,2) is at x=1,y=2.\n> \n> From current head (3,1), moving L to (2,1), then I can go to (1,1) or (2,2) or (2,0) but y=0 wall, so (2,0) invalid.\n> \n> (2,1) to (1,1) L, or to (2,2) U, or to (3,1) R, but that might be reverse or something.\n> \n> Also, (2,2) is a snake body segment? Snake has (2,2) at position 8.\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), the snake will be: new head at (2,1), then body: (3,1), (4,1), etc., tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list, head to tail.\n> \n> After moving L to (2,1):\n> \n> - New head: (2,1)\n> \n> - Then the body: the previous head (3,1) becomes segment 1, (4,1) segment 2, ..., up to tail (4,5) segment 15?

It's turn 65, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,1), and direction is L, which is left. So current head is (2,1), moving left. The positions are: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]. That's 16 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> 1.

The value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"value1\" etc., but in the input it's \"Value and Life Span\", and for each food, it's (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the input:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 2, 3, 1) - (6, 3, 6, 1) - (2, 4, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> So for (1,2): x=1,y=2, life_span=3, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): x=6,y=3, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (2,4): x=2,y=4, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> All value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,2), life_span=3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current, so on turn 65,66,67 it exists, gone on turn 68? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 65, life_span=3, so it will be there for 3 more turns: turn 65,66,67, and gone on turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life_span=6, exists until turn 70.\n> \n> (2,4) life_span=9, exists until turn 73.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,1), direction L, so moving left.

It's turn 66. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7.

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 66, life span 2 means it will be gone after turn 67? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: if life span is 1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t. If life span is 2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> In this case, food at (1,2): life span 2 at turn 66, so it can be eaten on turn 66 or 67, disappears after turn 67.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): value 1, life span 5, so available for 5 turns from now.\n> \n> (2,4): value 1, life span 8, available for 8 turns.\n> \n> All foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (1,1) with direction L.

Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

So if on turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown becomes N-2, and so on.\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn. So if life span is N on turn t, it is available until the end of turn t + N - 1. For example, life span 1 on turn t: it disappears after turn t, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n> \n> Life span 4 on turn 67: it can be eaten from turn 67 to turn 70 (since after turn 70, it disappears). Turn 67: life span 4, after turn 67, life span 3; after turn 68, life span 2; after turn 69, life span 1; after turn 70, life span 0, disappears. So available on turns 67,68,69,70? On turn 70, life span is 1 before eating, I think. Let's not overcomplicate; basically, food is present for N turns including the current one.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,4): life span 7, so available from turn 67 to 73.\n> \n> (4,2): life span 10, available to turn 76.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,2), direction U. So moving up, which increases y.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction U, so cannot instantly reverse to D. So possible moves: U, L, R. D is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at borders and (5,6).\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls are. But borders are walls, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls; internal (5,6) is wall.\n> \n> So cells: (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collision.\n> \n> Snake: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n> \n> Head at (1,2), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Food at (6,3), (2,4), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) is a food position, but let's see if snake occupies it.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2) is in the list, it's the 10th segment? Positions: index 0: (1,2) head, 1: (1,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (6,1), 7: (6,2), 8: (5,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,3), 13: (2,4), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,5), 16: (2,5) tail.\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied by the snake at index 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is index 13, occupied by snake.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) and (4,2) are under the snake body.\n> \n> Special rule: food under body can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, for (2,4), it's currently occupied, so to eat it, the snake must move so that this cell is vacated and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,2).\n> \n> Food at (6,3) is not occupied, so can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n> \n> Now, head at (1,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 67: U, L, R (since D is reverse, not allowed).\n> \n> If move U: to (1,3)\n> \n> Is (1,3) safe? Let's see what is at (1,3).\n> \n> From snake positions, (1,3) is not listed, so not occupied. But let's check walls: (1,3) x=1,y=3, within 1-6, not wall, so safe to move.\n> \n> If move L: to (0,2), but x=0 is wall, so collision, death.\n> \n> Cannot move L.\n> \n> If move R: to (2,2)\n> \n> (2,2) is occupied by snake at index 11, so body collision? But (2,2) is a body segment.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail (since tail will move), it collides.\n> \n> But in this case, (2,2) is not the tail; tail is (2,5). (2,2) is index 11, which is body, so if head moves to (2,2), it collides with body.\n> \n> Similarly, for tail: if head moves to the tail cell, and tail moves away, it's ok, no collision.\n> \n> But here, (2,2) is not tail.\n> \n> So moving R to (2,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 67, only possible moves are U or... L is wall, R is body, so only U is possible?\n> \n> U to (1,3): let's confirm if (1,3) is free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), etc., no (1,3). Walls: not border or obstacle. (5,6) is obstacle, but (1,3) is fine.\n> \n> So only possible action is U? But what about D? D is down, to (1,1), but (1,1) is occupied by snake index 1, body segment, so collision. Also, D is reverse direction, which is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Current direction U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> So for turn 67, only possible action is U to (1,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me list neighbors:\n> \n> - Up: (1,3) - not occupied, not wall\n> \n> - Down: (1,1) - occupied by snake, and reverse direction\n> \n> - Left: (0,2) - wall\n> \n> - Right: (2,2) - occupied by snake (index 11)\n> \n> So yes, only U is safe and allowed.\n> \n> So on turn 67, must move U to (1,3).\n> \n> Then, after moving, snake head is at (1,3), and the body follows. The tail moves, so the cell (1,1) might be vacated? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed or something? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, it moves forward, head to new cell, each body segment to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When it eats, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But here, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So after move U to (1,3):\n> \n> New head position: (1,3)\n> \n> Then the body: previous positions: segment 0 was (1,2), now segment 1 moves to (1,2), segment 2 to (1,1)?

It's turn 68. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,3), and the body segments follow: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5). That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up. That means the snake is moving upwards, so from (1,3) to (1,4) or something? Let me list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then (1,2) – that's down from head? (1,3) to (1,2) would be down, but head direction is U, which is confusing. Head direction is given as U, so it was moving up to get to (1,3). From where? The previous position before head is (1,2), but (1,2) is below (1,3), so if head was at (1,2) and moved up to (1,3), that makes sense. Direction U means it moved up to current position.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n> \n> So, head at (1,3), and the segment behind it is (1,2), which is directly below, so yes, it moved up to (1,3). Next is (1,1), which is down from (1,2), then (2,1), and so on. The tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> (1,5) is above (1,4)? Positions: from head (1,3), to (1,2), (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), etc., up to (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), ..., (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5). So (1,4) and (1,5) are part of the body. (1,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Now, head direction U means it's currently facing up, so possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since it moved up to (1,3), reverse would be down, so it cannot move down immediately. So valid moves from (1,3) are U (up to (1,4)), L (left to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so invalid), R (right to (2,3)), and D (down to (1,2)) but D is reverse, not allowed because head direction is U.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it moved to get to current position, so from previous position to head. Previous was (1,2) to (1,3), up. So current direction is U. Therefore, it cannot move down (opposite direction) next. So possible moves: Up (U) to (1,4), Left (L) to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so invalid. Right (R) to (2,3). Down (D) to (1,2) but reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> (1,2) is a body segment, but since the snake moves, the tail will move, so moving to (1,2) might be possible if it's the tail, but (1,2) is not the tail; the tail is (1,5). Let's see what (1,2) is: it's the second segment, so when snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment follows, so (1,2) will become the position of the next segment, etc.\n> \n> But for collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment at that time, it collides, except if it's the tail, because tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (1,2), which is currently occupied by the second segment, but after move, the tail moves, so (1,2) might be free or not? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn t, positions: head at (1,3), body at (1,2), (1,1), etc.\n> \n> After move, head moves to new cell, say new_head, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So the segment that was at (1,2) moves to where? It depends on where head goes.\n> \n> If head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, except when food is eaten, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> General rule: when snake moves:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to food cell, body segments follow, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of collision: head collides if it moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment (other than the tail) or a wall. If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because tail will move away.\n> \n> In this state, if head moves to (1,2), which is currently occupied by the second segment.

When head moves to (1,2), at that moment, before body moves, (1,2) is occupied, so head would collide with body. But if it's the tail, it's ok. Here, (1,2) is not tail; tail is (1,5).
