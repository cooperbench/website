        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state provided:\n\n1. **Current Turn (t₀)**: 1\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Cells**: These are the edges of the grid. Specifically:\n     - x = 0 (leftmost column)\n     - x = 7 (rightmost column)\n     - y = 0 (bottom row)\n     - y = 7 (top row)\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: These are walls inside the grid at coordinates:\n     - (1, 6)\n     - (1, 4)\n     - (3, 4)\n     - (1, 3)\n     - (2, 4)\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake consists of a single segment at (2, 3). This means the snake's head is at (2, 3), and since there's only one segment, there's no body or tail yet.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Left (\"L\").\n5. **Food Items**: There are four food items on the grid:\n   - (6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 9\n   - (5, 5): value = 1, life_span = 9\n   - (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 9\n   - (6, 4): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nSince the snake is currently moving Left (\"L\"), its possible next moves are constrained by the \"no instant reverse\" rule. This means it cannot move Right (\"R\") in the next turn. Therefore, the possible moves are Up (\"U\"), Down (\"D\"), or continue Left (\"L\").\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move based on the current state:\n\n#### 1. Moving Left (\"L\")\n- Current head position: (2, 3)\n- New head position: (2 - 1, 3) = (1, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Wall**: (1, 3) is listed as an internal obstacle. Moving here would collide with a wall → deadly collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move Left.\n\n#### 2. Moving Up (\"U\")\n- New head position: (2, 3 + 1) = (2, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Wall**: (2, 4) is an internal obstacle → deadly collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move Up.\n\n#### 3. Moving Down (\"D\")\n- New head position: (2, 3 - 1) = (2, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Wall**: \n    - Border walls are at y=0 and y=7. (2, 2) is not a border wall.\n    - Internal obstacles: (2, 2) is not listed as an obstacle.\n  - **Body**: The snake has only one segment, so no body collision.\n- **Food**: \n  - Is there food at (2, 2)? Checking the food positions:\n    - (6, 3), (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 4) → none at (2, 2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe to move Down. No food to eat, but no immediate danger.\n\n#### 4. Moving Right (\"R\")\n- Normally, moving Right would be the opposite of Left, which is the current direction, so this is an instant reverse.\n- However, since the snake has only one segment (no body), the \"no instant reverse\" rule might not strictly apply because there's no body to collide into by reversing. But the rules state that we cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn, regardless of the snake's length.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move Right due to instant reverse rule.\n\n### Verifying Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only viable move without collision is Down (\"D\"). \n\nLet me double-check if there are any other considerations:\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The snake has only one segment, so there's no tail to consider for this rule.\n- **Food Under Snake**: The snake is at (2, 3), and none of the food items are at this position, so this doesn't apply.\n- **Other Food**: The food items are all positive (value = 1), but none are reachable in this move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the constraints and the current state, the only safe move is Down (\"D\"). \n\n### Potential Next Steps After This Move\n\nAfter moving Down to (2, 2), the snake's new position will be [(2, 2)], and the direction can be updated based on the next move. Since we're only deciding the immediate action for the current turn, we don't need to plan beyond this.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully evaluating all possible moves and considering the game's rules, the safest and only viable immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

There are also internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n2. **Snake**: The snake has a single segment at (2, 2), meaning it's just the head. The current direction is \"D\" (Down).\n3. **Food**: There are four pieces of food with their positions, life spans, and values:\n   - (6, 3): value=8, life_span=1\n   - (5, 5): value=8, life_span=1\n   - (6, 6): value=8, life_span=1\n   - (6, 4): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing the Snake's Current Position and Direction\n\n- **Current Position**: (2, 2)\n- **Direction**: Down (D), which means the snake is moving in the negative y-direction.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nSince the snake is moving Down, the next possible moves are:\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: (2, 1)\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: (1, 2)\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: (3, 2)\n\n**Cannot move Up (U)** because it's the opposite of the current direction (D), and instant reverse is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (2, 1)\n- **Check for Walls**: y=1 is not a border wall (y=0 is). No internal obstacles at (2,1).\n- **Check for Food**: No food at (2,1).\n- **Safety**: Since the snake is only the head, there's no body collision risk.\n- **Outcome**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1, 2)\n- **Check for Walls**: x=1 is not a border wall (x=0 is). Check internal obstacles:\n  - (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) are obstacles but not at (1,2).\n- **Check for Food**: No food at (1,2).\n- **Safety**: Safe, no body collision (only head).\n- **Outcome**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3, 2)\n- **Check for Walls**: x=3 is not a border wall. Check internal obstacles:\n  - (3,4) is an obstacle but not at (3,2).\n- **Check for Food**: No food at (3,2).\n- **Safety**: Safe, no body collision.\n- **Outcome**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nAll food items are quite far from the current position (2,2). The closest is (6,3), (6,4), (5,5), and (6,6). \n\n- **Distance to (6,3)**: Manhattan distance is |6-2| + |3-2| = 5.\n- **Distance to (6,4)**: |6-2| + |4-2| = 6.\n- **Distance to (5,5)**: |5-2| + |5-2| = 6.\n- **Distance to (6,6)**: |6-2| + |6-2| = 8.\n\n### Strategy\n\nSince all food is far away, the immediate goal is to move towards the nearest food while avoiding obstacles and ensuring future flexibility.\n\n- **Nearest Food**: (6,3) is the closest.\n- **Path to (6,3)**: Need to move right (increase x) and then down (decrease y) or vice versa.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Action\n\nGiven the current position (2,2) and direction D, moving right (R) towards (3,2) is a step towards (6,3). \n\n- **Why not Down (D)?** It's safe but doesn't help in reaching any food.\n- **Why not Left (L)?** It's safe but moves away from all food items.\n\n### Potential Risks and Rewards\n\n- **Right (R)**: Moves towards the nearest food. No immediate reward but sets up a better position for future moves.\n- **Life Span Consideration**: All foods have a life span of 1, but since the countdown decreases every turn, they will disappear after the next turn. However, at t_0=2, the countdown is still 1, meaning they will be available at t=3 but disappear after that.\n\nBut, since the snake is only the head, it can only reach the food in multiple steps. It's not possible to reach any food in one move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, the best action is to move towards the nearest food. Moving right (R) is the most logical choice as it starts the journey towards (6,3).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Additionally, there are internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n2. **Snake**: The snake has a single segment at position (3, 2), meaning it's just the head with no body yet. The current direction is Right (R).\n3. **Food**: There are four food items on the grid, all with positive value (+1) and varying life spans. Their positions are:\n   - (6, 3)\n   - (5, 5)\n   - (6, 6)\n   - (6, 4)\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- Since the snake has only one segment (the head), there's no body to collide with yet.\n- The current direction is Right (R), so the next possible moves are Right (R), Up (U), or Down (D). Moving Left (L) would be an instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n- The walls are at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at specific points.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (3, 2)\n\nGiven the current direction is R, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move to (4, 2)\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is a border, but x=4 is within bounds.\n   - Check for internal obstacles: (4, 2) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (3, 3)\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is a border, but y=3 is within bounds.\n   - Check for internal obstacles: (3, 3) is not listed.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (3, 1)\n   - Check for walls: y=0 is a border, but y=1 is within bounds.\n   - Check for internal obstacles: (3, 1) is not listed.\n   - Safe move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see if any of the food items are adjacent to the current head position (3, 2):\n\n1. (6, 3): Distance is |6-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 (not adjacent)\n2. (5, 5): Distance is |5-3| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5 (not adjacent)\n3. (6, 6): Distance is |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7 (not adjacent)\n4. (6, 4): Distance is |6-3| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5 (not adjacent)\n\nNone of the food items are adjacent to the current head position. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move towards the nearest food.\n\n### Pathfinding to Nearest Food\n\nLet's find the Manhattan distance to each food item:\n\n1. (6, 3): 4\n2. (5, 5): 5\n3. (6, 6): 7\n4. (6, 4): 5\n\nThe closest food is at (6, 3) with a distance of 4.\n\n### Planning the Path to (6, 3)\n\nFrom (3, 2) to (6, 3):\n\n- Need to increase x by 3 and y by 1.\n- The current direction is R, so moving Right is aligned with increasing x.\n\nPossible sequence:\n1. Right (R) to (4, 2)\n2. Right (R) to (5, 2)\n3. Up (U) to (5, 3)\n4. Right (R) to (6, 3)\n\nBut since we're only deciding the immediate action, we need to choose the first move that brings us closer to the food.\n\n### Immediate Action Options\n\nGiven the current position (3, 2) and direction R, the options are R, U, D.\n\n- **Right (R)**: Moves to (4, 2). Distance to (6, 3) becomes |6-4| + |3-2| = 3.\n- **Up (U)**: Moves to (3, 3). Distance to (6, 3) becomes |6-3| + |3-3| = 3.\n- **Down (D)**: Moves to (3, 1). Distance to (6, 3) becomes |6-3| + |3-1| = 5.\n\nBoth R and U reduce the distance to the nearest food from 4 to 3, while D increases it to 5.\n\n### Choosing Between R and U\n\n- **Right (R)**:\n  - Aligns with the current direction, maintaining consistency.\n  - Next move could be R again to (5, 2), then U to (5, 3), etc.\n\n- **Up (U)**:\n  - Changes direction to Up.\n  - Next move options would be U, L, R (no D, as it's an instant reverse).\n\nBoth are valid, but moving Right keeps the path straightforward towards increasing x, which is necessary to reach x=6.\n\n### Checking for Obstacles in Path\n\nLet's ensure that the path is clear:\n\n1. Right to (4, 2): No obstacles.\n2. Right to (5, 2): No obstacles.\n3. Up to (5, 3): Check (5, 3) for obstacles. Not listed.\n4. Right to (6, 3): Check (6, 3). It's a food position, no obstacles.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Since the snake has no body yet, no risk of collision.\n- No food is under the snake's body (only one segment).\n- No tail reward danger (no tail yet).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most efficient immediate move to get closer to the nearest food at (6, 3) is to continue moving Right (R), as it maintains the current direction and reduces the distance to the target.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Current Snake State:\n- **Snake Positions**: [(4, 2)] (only the head, no body segments)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: R (right)\n- **Possible Moves**: Since the snake is moving right (`R`), the next move cannot be left (`L`) (no instant reverse). The possible moves are:\n  - Up (`U`): (4, 3)\n  - Down (`D`): (4, 1)\n  - Right (`R`): (5, 2)\n\n### 2. Wall and Obstacle Constraints:\n- **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8 (0 to 7).\n- **Internal Obstacles**: [(1, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)]\n- Check if possible moves hit walls or obstacles:\n  - `U` (4, 3): Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - `D` (4, 1): Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - `R` (5, 2): Not a wall or obstacle.\n\n### 3.

Distance to Food:\n- The snake is at (4, 2). Let's compute Manhattan distance to each food:\n  - (6, 3): |6-4| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n  - (5, 5): |5-4| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n  - (6, 6): |6-4| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n  - (6, 4): |6-4| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n  - (1, 5): |1-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nThe closest food is at (6, 3) with distance = 3.\n\n### 5.

(6,3): Right and Up from (5,2) → direction: RU\n2. (5,5): Directly Up from (5,2) → UUU\n3. (6,6): Right and Up Up Up from (5,2) → RUUU\n4. (6,4): Right and Up Up from (5,2) → RUU\n5. (1,5): Left and Up Up Up from (5,2) → L is not possible, so ignore.\n\nSince the snake is length 1, no body collisions are possible yet. Also, no \"Tail Reward Danger\" since there's no tail.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nWe want to maximize score by eating positive food (all food here is +1). Let's see which moves bring us closer to food:\n\n1. **Move R to (6,2)**:\n   - Next to (6,3), (6,4), (6,6).\n   - Next move could be U to (6,3) or (6,4) etc.\n   - Immediate move doesn't eat food, but positions well for next moves.\n2. **Move U to (5,3)**:\n   - Next to (5,5) (two U's away), (6,3) (R then U), (6,4) (R then U).\n   - Doesn't immediately eat food.\n3. **Move D to (5,1)**:\n   - Away from all food; not optimal.\n\nBetween R and U, both don't immediately eat food, but R seems better because:\n- (6,3) is one U away from (6,2).\n- (6,4) is two U's away from (6,2).\n- (5,5) is three U's from (5,2), but moving R first may not help as much.\n\nAlternatively, moving U to (5,3) could be aiming for (5,5), but that's two more U's.\n\nGiven that (6,3) has a life_span of 5, and current turn is 5, it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So if we don't reach it this turn, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly:\n- (5,5): life_span=5, disappears after this turn.\n- (6,6): life_span=5, disappears after this turn.\n- (6,4): life_span=6, will be there next turn.\n- (1,5): life_span=9, far away and not reachable soon.\n\n**Can we eat any food this turn?**\nCurrent head is at (5,2). To eat food, must move head onto food:\n- (6,3): need to move to (6,3). Current is (5,2). To reach (6,3) in one move: must move R then U, but can't do both in one turn.\n- Similarly, others are not adjacent to (5,2).\n\nThus, cannot eat any food this turn. So the goal is to position for next turn where some food remains.\n\nFood that will remain next turn:\n- (6,4): life_span=6, will be 5 next turn, then 4, etc.\n- (1,5): life_span=9, will be 8 next turn.\n\nOthers disappear after this turn.\n\nSo best is to aim for (6,4), which is at (6,4). From (5,2):\n- Move R to (6,2), then next turn can move U to (6,3), then U to (6,4).\n- Or move U to (5,3), then R to (6,3), then U to (6,4).\n\nFirst path is R then U U.\nSecond is U then R U.\n\nBoth take same number of steps, but moving R first seems better because:\n- After R to (6,2), next move U to (6,3), then U to (6,4).\n- (6,3) is disappearing this turn, so next turn it's gone, but (6,4) is still there.\n\nAlternatively, moving U to (5,3), then R to (6,3) but (6,3) is gone next turn, so next would be R to (6,3) but that's invalid (gone), so would have to go U to (6,4).\n\nActually, both paths seem similar in steps to (6,4). Maybe R first is better because it's in the current direction (no turn).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nCurrently no body to collide with, and walls are avoided by valid moves.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to continue moving Right (R) to (6,2), setting up to move towards (6,4) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Additional walls at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Only one segment at (6,2), which means the snake is just its head with no body segments (length = 1).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Five pieces of food, all with a value of +1 (positive food) and varying life spans:\n     - (6,3): life span = 4\n     - (5,5): life span = 4\n     - (6,6): life span = 4\n     - (6,4): life span = 5\n     - (1,5): life span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move (no instant reverse rule). So, possible immediate moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move from (6,2) to (7,2)\n   - Check if (7,2) is a wall: x=7 is a border wall → collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move from (6,2) to (6,3)\n   - Check if (6,3) is a wall: No walls at (6,3).\n   - Check for food: (6,3) has food with value +1.\n     - Since the snake has no body (only head), eating this food will increase length to 2.\n     - No risk of tail collision (since tail doesn't exist yet).\n   - **Valid move with reward**.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move from (6,2) to (6,1)\n   - Check if (6,1) is a wall: No walls at (6,1).\n   - Check for food: No food at (6,1).\n   - **Valid move but no immediate reward**.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n\n- (6,3): Directly above the head, can be eaten by moving Up.\n- (5,5): Requires moving Left then Up, but current direction is Right, so Left is not allowed next move.\n- (6,6): Requires moving Up multiple steps, but there's an internal wall at (1,6) which doesn't block this path directly, but it's farther.\n- (6,4): Requires moving Up twice.\n- (1,5): Very far, not immediately accessible.\n\nThe most accessible food is at (6,3), which can be eaten immediately by moving Up.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nSince the snake currently has no body segments, the only risks are walls and the no instant reverse rule. Moving Up to (6,3) is safe in this regard.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the options:\n\n- Right: Leads to immediate death (wall collision).\n- Up: Eats positive food, increases length safely.\n- Down: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the positive food at (6,3).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n\nIn our case, the snake has no tail (length = 1), so this rule doesn't apply. Thus, no danger from eating the food at (6,3).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the current state, the optimal immediate action is to move Up to eat the positive food at (6,3).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 7\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot go outside these bounds.\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). These are additional walls inside the grid that the snake must avoid.\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions: Head at (6,3), body at (6,2). So, the snake is two segments long.\n- Current direction: U (Up). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous move.\n\n**Food Items:**\nEach food is represented as (x, y, life_span, value). All foods here have a value of +1 (positive food), and their life spans vary.\n1. (5,5,3,1)\n2. (6,6,3,1)\n3. (6,4,4,1)\n4. (1,5,7,1)\n5. (2,6,10,1)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,3) and current direction U (Up), the possible moves are U, L, or R (since moving directly opposite, which would be D, is not allowed unless it's the only option, but here it's not).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U):** Move from (6,3) to (6,4)\n   - Check for walls: (6,4) is not a wall (internal or border).\n   - Check for body collision: The body is at (6,2), so no collision.\n   - Check for food at (6,4): Yes, there's food at (6,4,4,1).\n     - Eating this food would increase length by 1 (from 2 to 3), and the new tail would be at the old head position (6,3).\n     - Check for \"Tail Reward Danger\": After eating, the new tail is at (6,3), and the head moves to (6,4). The head is adjacent to the tail if the tail is at (6,3), but the head is at (6,4), which is directly above (6,3), so they are adjacent. However, the danger is if the tail cell has positive food that we're eating now, which it doesn't (the food is at (6,4), not at the tail's current position (6,2)). Wait, let's clarify:\n       - Tail Reward Danger occurs if the head is adjacent to the tail AND the tail cell has positive food that we're eating now.\n       - Currently, tail is at (6,2), and we're moving to (6,4), not eating anything at (6,2). The food is at (6,4), which is where the head is moving to.\n       - So, no Tail Reward Danger here.\n   - So, moving U to (6,4) is safe and eats +1 food.\n\n2. **Left (L):** Move from (6,3) to (5,3)\n   - Check for walls: (5,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body: Body is at (6,2), no collision.\n   - Check for food: No food at (5,3).\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Right (R):** Move from (6,3) to (7,3)\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,3) is a wall. Cannot move here.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: U (eats food), L (no food).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the foods:\n\n1. (5,5,3,1): At (5,5), life span 3, value +1.\n   - Distance from (6,3): Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n   - It's 3 turns away, and life span is 3, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown includes current turn). So, it's not reachable in time.\n\n2. (6,6,3,1): At (6,6), life span 3, value +1.\n   - Distance: |6-6| + |3-6| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n   - Same as above, disappears after this turn, not reachable.\n\n3. (6,4,4,1): At (6,4), life span 4, value +1.\n   - Distance: |6-6| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n   - Can be reached in 1 move (this turn), and life span is 4, so it will be there for 3 more turns after this (since countdown decreases this turn to 3).\n   - So, we can eat it now by moving U.\n\n4. (1,5,7,1): At (1,5), life span 7, value +1.\n   - Distance: |6-1| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7.\n   - Life span is 7, so it will be there for 6 more turns after this. Might be reachable in future.\n\n5. (2,6,10,1): At (2,6), life span 10, value +1.\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7.\n   - Life span is 10, so plenty of time.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nFrom the immediate options:\n- Move U: eats (6,4), +1 score, length increases to 3.\n- Move L: no food, but safe.\n\nIs there any reason not to eat the food at (6,4)?\n- It's safe to eat (no Tail Reward Danger, as explained).\n- Other foods are either too far or will disappear before we can reach them.\n- Moving L doesn't give any immediate benefit.\n\nAdditionally, after eating (6,4), the snake's new positions will be:\n- Head: (6,4)\n- Body: (6,3), (6,2)\nLength is 3.\n\nFuture moves can then consider other foods like (1,5) or (2,6), but for now, the immediate best move is to eat the closest available positive food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move U\n\nAfter moving U to (6,4):\n- Next turn, head is at (6,4), direction is U.\n- Possible moves: U (to (6,5)), L (to (5,4)), R (to (7,4)) - but R is wall.\n- Check U to (6,5):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Body will be at (6,3) and (6,2), no collision.\n  - No food at (6,5).\n- L to (5,4):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Body at (6,3) and (6,2), no collision.\n  - No food at (5,4).\nSo, both U and L are safe next moves, but no immediate food. This is fine; we can plan then.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Moving L Now\n\nIf we move L now to (5,3):\n- Next turn, head is at (5,3), direction is L.\n- Possible moves: U (to (5,4)), L (to (4,3)), D (to (5,2)) - but D is opposite of current direction (L), so is it allowed? Current direction is U, and we're moving L now, so next direction can be U, L, or R (not D, since D is opposite of U, but current move is L, so not sure. Need to clarify \"No instant reverse\" rule.\n  \nThe rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\nCurrent direction before move is U. We're moving L now, so after move, direction is L.\nThen next turn, cannot move opposite of L, which is R. So can move U, L, or D.\n\nBut moving L now seems less beneficial since we're not eating food, and the next moves may not lead to immediate food either.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the food at (6,4), increasing the score by +1 and the snake's length to 3, without any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Additional walls at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), and (2,4).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (6,5), followed by body segments at (6,4) and (6,3).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Up (\"U\").\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (5,5): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (1,5): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since it's currently moving Up, it cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible immediate moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (6,6)\n- **New Head Position**: (6,6)\n- **Check for Walls**: \n  - y=6 is not a border wall (y=7 is the border).\n  - (6,6) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n  - So, no wall collision.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Current body segments: (6,4), (6,3). (6,6) is not part of the body.\n  - After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new body is (6,5), (6,4). No collision.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - (6,6) has food with value=1.\n  - **Eating Food**:\n    - The head moves to (6,6), which has food.\n    - The body is currently at (6,4), (6,3). The tail is at (6,3).\n    - Is the head adjacent to the tail? \n      - Tail is at (6,3), head is moving to (6,6). Distance is |6-6| + |6-3| = 3, not adjacent (adjacent means distance=1).\n    - So, no tail reward danger.\n    - Eating is safe: +1 score, length increases by 1.\n    - New snake: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move with +1 score.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5,5)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,5)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=5 is not a border wall.\n  - (5,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Body is at (6,4), (6,3). (5,5) is not part of the body.\n  - After moving, new body is (6,5), (6,4). No collision.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - (5,5) has food with value=1.\n  - **Eating Food**:\n    - Head moves to (5,5), which has food.\n    - Tail is at (6,3). Distance to head: |5-6| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent.\n    - Safe to eat: +1 score, length increases by 1.\n    - New snake: head at (5,5), body at (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move with +1 score.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7,5)\n- **New Head Position**: (7,5)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=7 is a border wall. Cannot move here.\n- **Conclusion**: Invalid move, leads to wall collision.\n\n### Comparing Valid Moves: U vs. L\n\nBoth U and L are valid moves that allow eating food with +1 score. Now, let's see if one is better than the other:\n\n1. **Move Up to (6,6)**:\n   - Eats food at (6,6).\n   - After eating, snake grows to length 4: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n   - Next moves from (6,6):\n     - Can't go U (to (6,7)): y=7 is border wall.\n     - Can go L (to (5,6)): check if (5,6) is safe.\n       - (5,6): no walls, not part of new body (which will be (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)), no food there.\n     - Can go R (to (7,6)): x=7 is wall.\n     - So, only L is possible next, leading to (5,6), which is safe but no immediate food.\n\n2. **Move Left to (5,5)**:\n   - Eats food at (5,5).\n   - After eating, snake grows to length 4: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n   - Next moves from (5,5):\n     - Can't go D (reverse of current U).\n     - Can go U (to (5,6)): \n       - (5,6): no walls, not part of new body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)), no food.\n     - Can go L (to (4,5)):\n       - (4,5): no walls, not part of body, no food.\n     - Can go R (to (6,5)):\n       - (6,5) is part of the new body (second segment). Would collide unless tail moves away.\n       - Current tail is at (6,3). After move to (5,5), tail moves to (6,4).\n       - Moving R to (6,5): head at (6,5), body at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) → collision at (6,5).\n       - So, R is invalid.\n     - So, possible next moves: U or L, both safe but no immediate food.\n\nBoth moves lead to similar immediate gains. However, moving Up to (6,6) leaves the snake in a position where the only next move is Left to (5,6), which is safe but doesn't lead to immediate food. Moving Left to (5,5) offers more options next turn (U or L), potentially keeping more options open.\n\nBut also, the food at (6,6) and (5,5) both have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So we should prioritize eating one of them now.\n\nBetween the two, moving Up to (6,6) seems slightly better because after eating, the snake is aligned vertically, which might be better for future movements in this grid with internal obstacles.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in choosing U or L?\n\n- **Move U to (6,6)**:\n  - After move, snake is at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n  - Next turn, only L to (5,6) is possible.\n    - (5,6): no food, no walls, no body collision.\n    - Then, from (5,6), possible moves:\n      - Can't go R (reverse of L).\n      - U to (5,7): y=7 is wall.\n      - D to (5,5): \n        - (5,5): was food but eaten this turn, so empty now.\n        - Body will be (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), so (5,5) is safe.\n      - L to (4,6): \n        - (4,6): no walls, not part of body.\n      - So, options are D or L, both safe.\n\n- **Move L to (5,5)**:\n  - After move, snake is at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n  - Next turn, can go U to (5,6) or L to (4,5).\n    - (5,6): no food, safe.\n    - (4,5): no food, safe.\n    - From (5,6) or (4,5), similar safe continuations.\n\nBoth seem safe, but moving U now allows eating (6,6), which is directly above the current head, maintaining a straight path, which might be simpler.\n\n### Considering Other Foods\n\nOther foods are at (1,5) and (2,6), both with longer life spans (5 and 8 turns). They are far away, so not immediately relevant for this decision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth U and L are safe and\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n     - So, the snake is vertical, heading upwards (since the head is at (6,6) and the next segment is at (6,5), which is below it).\n   - **Current Direction**: U (Up). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous turn.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (1,5): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6,1): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,6), the possible moves are Up, Down, Left, Right. However:\n\n- **Current Direction is Up (U)**, so the opposite direction (Down) is not allowed on the next move to prevent instant reverse.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,6) → (6,7)\n   - (6,7): Check if it's a wall or body.\n     - y=7 is a border wall. So, this is a wall collision → deadly.\n   - **Result**: Death. Not an option.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (6,6) → (5,6)\n   - Check (5,6):\n     - Not a wall (x=5 is not a border, and no internal obstacles at (5,6)).\n     - Not part of the snake's body (body is at (6,5),(6,4),(6,3)).\n   - **Safe to move here**.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (6,6) → (7,6)\n   - (7,6): x=7 is a border wall → deadly.\n   - **Result**: Death. Not an option.\n\nSo, the only safe move is **Left (L)** to (5,6).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Left leads to eating any food:\n\n- New head position after Left: (5,6)\n   - Is there food at (5,6)? Checking the food list:\n     - (1,5), (2,6), (6,1) → no food at (5,6).\n   - So, no food eaten, just a safe move.\n\nIs there any other consideration? \n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: \n   - The tail is at (6,3). \n   - Is the head adjacent to the tail after moving Left? \n     - New head at (5,6), tail at (6,3). \n     - Distance: |5-6| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\n   - Also, no food is at the tail's current position (6,3) in the food list.\n   - So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to move Left? \n\n- The other moves lead to death, so no.\n- Maybe planning ahead: moving Left takes us away from the food at (2,6) and (6,1), but since we can't reach them safely now, it's okay.\n\n### Evaluating Other Moves Again\n\nWait, is Down completely forbidden? \n\n- Current direction is U, so opposite is D. Rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n- So Down is not allowed this turn.\n\nThus, only Left is possible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, the only safe and legal move is **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 11.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot go beyond these coordinates.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls): (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)].\n     - Head at (5,6), next segment at (6,6), then (6,5), tail at (6,4).\n   - Current head direction: L (Left). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so it came from (6,6) to (5,6).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (1,5): value=1, life_span=4.\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=6.\n   - (6,1): value=1, life_span=9.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,6), the possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: The snake was moving Left (L), so it cannot immediately go Right (R). So, R is not an option.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: Move to (4,6).\n   - Check for walls: (4,6) is not listed as a wall or obstacle.\n   - Check for body collision: The body segments are at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). (4,6) is not any of these, so safe.\n   - Check for food: No food at (4,6).\n   - So, moving Left is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (5,7).\n   - Check walls: y=7 is a border wall. So, cannot move Up.\n   - So, Up is invalid.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (5,5).\n   - Check walls: (5,5) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - Check body collision: Body segments are at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). (5,5) is not any of these, so safe.\n   - Check for food: No food at (5,5).\n   - So, moving Down is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\nHmm, both Left and Down are safe but don't eat any food. Is there any other consideration?\n\n### Checking Food Accessibility\n\nLet's see if any food is reachable soon:\n\n1. Food at (1,5):\n   - Current head at (5,6). To reach (1,5), need to go left and down.\n   - Distance: |5-1| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n   - Life span: 4. So, it will disappear before we can reach it (since we need 5 turns, but it has 4 left).\n\n2. Food at (2,6):\n   - Current head at (5,6). To reach (2,6), need to go left.\n   - Distance: |5-2| = 3 steps.\n   - Life span: 6. So, it will still be there (6 >= 3).\n   - Path: Left to (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6).\n   - But is (3,6) safe? No walls or body there currently.\n   - However, after moving to (4,6), next move to (3,6) might be safe, but need to ensure no body collision then.\n   - Currently, body will move from (6,6) to (5,6), (6,5) to (6,6), (6,4) to (6,5). So next body positions: [(new head), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)].\n   - So, (3,6) is safe in next step.\n\n   But to start this path, first move should be Left to (4,6).\n\n3. Food at (6,1):\n   - Current head at (5,6). To reach (6,1), need to go right and down.\n   - But current direction is L, so cannot go R immediately.\n   - Next turn could go R, but then need to go down multiple steps.\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps.\n   - Life span: 9, so it will be there.\n   - But initial move cannot be R, so not immediately helpful.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous?\n\nTail is at (6,4). Is there food at (6,4)? No, the foods are at (1,5), (2,6), (6,1). So no danger from that.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Down\n\nBoth Left and Down are safe and don't eat food immediately. But Left starts a path towards the food at (2,6), which is reachable within its lifespan.\n\nDown doesn't lead directly to any food in the immediate future.\n\nTherefore, Left seems better to start moving towards the food at (2,6).\n\n### Verifying Left Move\n\nMove Left to (4,6):\n\n- New head: (4,6).\n- Body moves: (6,6) -> (5,6), (6,5) -> (6,6), (6,4) -> (6,5).\n- New body: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)].\n- Next turn, can move Left to (3,6), then to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nNo immediate collisions or walls in this path.\n\n### Alternative Consideration\n\nIs there any risk in moving Left that I'm missing?\n\n- After Left, next move is Left to (3,6):\n  - (3,6) is not a wall, not in new body [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)].\n- Then Left to (2,6):\n  - (2,6) is not a wall, not in body at that time.\n  - And can eat the food there safely (no tail collision since tail will have moved away by then).\n\nSeems safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to start heading towards the food at (2,6), which is reachable within its lifespan and provides a +1 reward.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(1,5): value=3, life_span=1\n2. (2,6): value=5, life_span=1\n3. (6,1): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction instantly. Since the last move was Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) next.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, L\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for collisions and food opportunities.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U): (x, y+1)\nCurrent head: (4,6)\nNew head position: (4,7)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (4,7) a wall? y=7 is a border wall → collision → deadly\n- So, U is invalid.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D): (x, y-1)\nNew head position: (4,5)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (4,5) a wall? No walls at (4,5)\n- Is (4,5) part of the snake's body? \n  - Body segments: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) → no, (4,5) is not in the body\n- Any food at (4,5)? No food listed there\n- So, D is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L): (x-1, y)\nNew head position: (3,6)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (3,6) a wall? No walls at (3,6)\n- Is (3,6) part of the snake's body? \n  - Body segments: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) → no, (3,6) is not in the body\n- Any food at (3,6)? No food listed there\n- So, L is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R): Not allowed (reverse of last move L)\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (D and L), neither directly leads to food. But let's see if moving in a certain direction can set us up to get food next turn.\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (1,5): value=3, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n2. (2,6): value=5, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n3. (6,1): value=8, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n\nGiven that all food will disappear after this turn, we need to reach them this turn to eat them. \n\nCan we reach any food this turn?\n\nCurrent head: (4,6)\n\nFood positions:\n- (1,5): distance is |4-1| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4 (can't reach in one move)\n- (2,6): distance is |4-2| + |6-6| = 2 + 0 = 2 (can't reach in one move)\n- (6,1): distance is |4-6| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7 (can't reach)\n\nSo, none of the food is adjacent to the head, meaning we can't eat any food this turn regardless of our move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe only food that's somewhat close is (2,6), which is two cells to the left of the head (4,6). The tail is at (6,5). \n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail? \nAdjacent means one cell away in any direction (including diagonally? Assuming only up, down, left, right for adjacency).\n\nHead: (4,6)\nTail: (6,5)\nDistance: |4-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3 → not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1)\n\nSo, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding Between D and L\n\nBoth D and L are safe moves with no immediate food gain. Which is better?\n\nLet's see where each move takes us and potential next moves.\n\n**Option 1: Move D to (4,5)**\nNext head: (4,5)\nPossible next moves (can't reverse D, so can't go U):\n- L: (3,5)\n- R: (5,5)\n- D: (4,4)\n\nFrom (4,5), we're moving away from the current body (which is to the right and above). This seems safe.\n\n**Option 2: Move L to (3,6)**\nNext head: (3,6)\nPossible next moves (can't reverse L, so can't go R):\n- U: (3,7) → y=7 is wall → invalid\n- D: (3,5)\n- L: (2,6)\n\nFrom (3,6), moving L to (2,6) would reach the food (2,6) next turn if it weren't disappearing this turn. But since it is, not useful.\n\nMoving D to (3,5) is safe.\n\nBetween the two, moving D seems slightly better because it's moving the snake into a more open area (towards the center), whereas moving L keeps us near the left wall where there are obstacles.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Danger\n\nAfter D to (4,5), snake positions:\n[(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)] (tail (6,5) moves away)\n\nNo collisions, no walls.\n\nAfter L to (3,6), snake positions:\n[(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)] (tail (6,5) moves away)\n\nAlso no collisions, no walls.\n\nBoth are safe, but D seems more central.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nAfter D to (4,5), next turn we can consider moving towards other areas where food might spawn. The current food is all disappearing, so new food will appear next turn.\n\nAfter L to (3,6), we're closer to the left wall with obstacles, which might limit future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both moves are safe and no food can be eaten this turn, choosing the move that keeps the snake in a more open area is preferable. Moving Down (D) seems better than Left (L) in this case.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 13  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: [(1, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)]\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]  \n- Head is at (4,5), followed by body segments at (4,6), (5,6), and tail at (6,6).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1, 5), value=2, life_span=1\n2. (2, 6), value=4, life_span=1\n3. (6, 1), value=7, life_span=1\n4. (3, 2), value=10, life_span=1\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) and direction D (Down), the possible next moves are:\n- **Continue Down (D)**: (4,5) → (4,4)\n- **Turn Left (L)**: (4,5) → (3,5)\n- **Turn Right (R)**: (4,5) → (5,5)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that would be the opposite of the current direction D, which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: Is (4,4) a wall?\n  - Border walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: Check if (4,4) is in [(1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)]. No, (4,4) is not there.\n- Body: Will the head collide with any body segment after moving?\n  - Current body segments: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n  - After moving, the tail will move forward (since the snake grows only if it eats food), so the new body will be [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] (tail at (6,6) moves away).\n  - New head at (4,4) does not overlap with any of these.\n  \nCheck for food at (4,4):\n- Food positions: (1,5), (2,6), (6,1), (3,2). None at (4,4).\n\nSo, moving Down is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,5)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: Is (3,5) a wall?\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: Not in the list.\n- Body:\n  - New body: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n  - Head at (3,5) not overlapping.\n\nCheck for food at (3,5):\n- No food there.\n\nSo, moving Left is safe but no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: Is (5,5) a wall?\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: Not in the list.\n- Body:\n  - New body: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n  - Head at (5,5) not overlapping.\n\nCheck for food at (5,5):\n- No food there.\n\nSo, moving Right is safe but no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn. Let's see which ones are reachable next turn if we position ourselves to reach them in future.\n\nCurrent head at (4,5). Foods:\n1. (1,5) - left side, x=1, y=5\n   - To reach (1,5) from (4,5), need to move left three times: (4,5)→(3,5)→(2,5)→(1,5)\n   - But food disappears after this turn, so can't reach it in time.\n2. (2,6) - x=2, y=6\n   - From (4,5), possible path: (4,5)→(4,6)→(3,6)→(2,6) (but (4,6) is current body, can't go there)\n   - Or (4,5)→(3,5)→(3,6)→(2,6)\n   - Also can't reach in one move.\n3. (6,1) - far away, can't reach in time.\n4. (3,2) - x=3, y=2\n   - From (4,5), need to go down and left: (4,5)→(4,4)→(4,3)→(3,3)→(3,2)\n   - Can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, none of the foods can be eaten this turn directly.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is under the tail and can be eaten by moving the tail away and head onto it.\nTail is at (6,6). Is there food at (6,6)? No, foods are at (1,5), (2,6), (6,1), (3,2). So no.\n\n### Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe but don't lead to food this turn. Since all foods will disappear after this turn, we can't get any now. So, the priority is to position the snake for future food collection while staying safe.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving Down (D) to (4,4):\n  - Next moves could be to go towards (3,2) food, but it's disappearing.\n- Moving Left (L) to (3,5):\n  - Next could go down to (3,4), but (3,4) is an internal obstacle.\n  - Or left to (2,5), then down to (2,4) - but (2,4) is an obstacle.\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,5):\n  - Next could go down to (5,4), then left towards (3,2), but that food is gone.\n  - Or right to (6,5), then down towards (6,1), but that's also disappearing.\n\nSince all foods are disappearing, and all moves are safe, we can choose any. Moving Right seems slightly better as it moves the snake towards the center, giving more options next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move is to go Right, as it doesn't lead to any immediate danger and keeps the snake in a relatively open area.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 15  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]  \nThis means:\n- Head at (6,5)\n- Body segments at (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right)  \nThis tells us the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2,6): value=3, life_span=1\n2. (6,1): value=5, life_span=1\n3. (3,2): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head position (6,5), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is R, we cannot instantly reverse to L (no instant reverse rule). So possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (7,5)\n- Check for walls: x=7 is a border wall. So moving right would hit the wall → deadly collision.  \n**Invalid move**.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (6,6)\n- New head position: (6,6)\n- Check for body collisions:\n  - Body segments are at (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n  - (6,6) is not in the body → safe\n- Check for walls: no walls at (6,6)\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (6,6)\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (6,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Check for body collisions:\n  - Body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n  - (6,4) is not in the body → safe\n- Check for walls: no walls at (6,4)\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (6,4)\n\nThis move is also safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 4. Move Left (L) to (5,5)\n- Normally, moving left would be to (5,5), but current direction is R, and L is opposite to R, so instant reverse is not allowed.  \n**Invalid move**.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next move or if we should plan to move towards food in future turns.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2,6): value=3, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Current head at (6,5). Distance is |6-2| + |5-6| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps away. Cannot reach in one move.\n2. (6,1): value=5, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |6-6| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4 steps away. Cannot reach in one move.\n3. (3,2): value=8, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps away. Cannot reach in one move.\n\nAll foods are too far to reach in the next move, and their life spans are 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. So we cannot eat any food this turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- Eating it would cause the head and newly grown tail to collide.\n\nOur tail is at (4,6). Adjacent cells to the tail are:\n- (3,6), (5,6), (4,5), (4,7) (but y=7 is a wall, so (4,7) is invalid)\n  \nOur head is at (6,5), which is not adjacent to (4,6) (distance is |6-4| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent). So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom the valid moves:\n- U to (6,6): safe, no food\n- D to (6,4): safe, no food\n\nBoth moves are safe and don't lead to immediate food. Since no food can be eaten this turn, and both moves are equally safe, we can choose either. \n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body:\n- Current body: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n- If we move U to (6,6), the body becomes [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] (tail (4,6) moves away)\n- If we move D to (6,4), the body becomes [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nMoving U might be slightly better because it moves the head away from the body's current path, potentially opening more options in future moves. Moving D would bring the head closer to the lower part where there's an obstacle at (1,4), but that's not immediately concerning.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that moving D to (6,4) might position the snake better to go towards the center where more food could spawn, but with the given information, both moves are equally valid.\n\nSince no food is reachable and both moves are safe, I'll choose to move Up to keep the snake moving in a direction that doesn't immediately limit future options.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest move is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

It was the tail, which moves away, so no collision unless the new head and new tail collide.\n\nAfter move:\n- Tail was at (5,5), moves to (6,5) (since the body was [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)], and the tail moves forward from (6,5) to (5,5) is not straightforward.

Both L and D are safe but don't lead to food. \n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that we can aim for?\n\nAdjacent cells to head (5,6):\n- U (5,7): wall\n- D (5,5): no food\n- L (4,6): no food\n- R (6,6): body segment, no food\n\nSo no immediate food to eat. \n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nSince immediate moves don't lead to food, perhaps we can plan a path towards the nearest food.\n\nFood locations:\n1. (2,6): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (6,1): value=3, life_span=1\n3. (3,2): value=6, life_span=1\n4. (4,2): value=9, life_span=1\n\nLife spans are all 1, meaning they will disappear next turn, so we can't reach them unless we're adjacent now.\n\nCurrent adjacent cells to head (5,6) have no food, so no food can be eaten this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food under the tail that could be dangerous?\n\nTail is at (5,5). Is there positive food at (5,5)? No food is listed there.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nBoth L and D are safe. Which is better?\n\n- Moving D to (5,5):\n  - Next turn, head at (5,5), can move L to (4,5), D to (5,4), or R to (6,5) (but R is opposite of current L, so not allowed unless we changed direction).\n  \n- Moving L to (4,6):\n  - Next turn, head at (4,6), can move U (wall), D to (4,5), L to (3,6), or R to (5,6) (opposite of L, so not allowed unless direction changed).\n\nMoving D seems slightly better because it keeps more options open for the next move (can go L or D from (5,5)), whereas from (4,6), can only go D or L next.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince no immediate food can be eaten, and both moves are safe, choose the move that keeps more options open next turn. Moving Down (D) seems slightly better in this case.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Layout**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n   - Internal obstacles are at: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) (tail).\n   - Current direction: Down (D), meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (6,1): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (3,2): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (4,2): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,5)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that would be the opposite of the current direction D (no instant reverse).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (5,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at the bottom, so (5,4) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: The internal obstacles are at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (5,4) is not in this list.\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). (5,4) is not in these.\n- Food at (5,4)? No food listed there.\n- After moving, the new snake positions would be: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. The tail (6,5) moves away, so no collision with the new tail.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left, so (4,5) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (4,5) is not in the obstacle list.\n  - Body: (4,5) is not in the current body segments.\n- Food at (4,5)? No food listed there.\n- After moving: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. Tail was at (6,5), which moves away.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is right, so (6,5) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (6,5) is not in the obstacle list.\n  - Body: Current tail is at (6,5). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Is there positive food at the tail? The tail is at (6,5). Looking at food positions:\n      - (6,1): no\n      - (3,2): no\n      - (4,2): no\n    - So no food at (6,5), hence no danger.\n- Food at (6,5)? No, as above.\n- After moving: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. The tail was at (6,5), which is now the head, and the old head (5,5) becomes the second segment. The tail moves from (6,6) to (5,6), so no collision.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon or if we should aim for any:\n\n1. (6,1): value=1, life=3\n   - Distance from (5,5): |6-5| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n   - Life span is 3, so it will disappear before we can reach it (since we're at turn 18, it disappears at turn 21, and we can't reach it by then).\n\n2. (3,2): value=1, life=5\n   - Distance: |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps.\n   - Life span is 5, so it disappears at turn 23. We can reach it by turn 23 if we start moving towards it now.\n\n3. (4,2): value=1, life=8\n   - Distance: |4-5| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n   - Life span is 8, disappears at turn 26. Easily reachable.\n\nBetween (3,2) and (4,2), (4,2) is closer and has a longer life, so it's a better target.\n\n### Path to (4,2)\n\nFrom (5,5) to (4,2):\n- Need to decrease x from 5 to 4: move left once.\n- Need to decrease y from 5 to 2: move down three times.\nSo one possible path: L (to (4,5)), then D, D, D.\n\nBut let's see if we can start moving towards it now.\n\nCurrent position: (5,5)\nNext move options:\n- D: (5,4) - gets us closer in y but not in x.\n- L: (4,5) - gets us closer in x, but y remains same.\n- R: (6,5) - away in x.\n\nSo moving L to (4,5) is the first step towards (4,2).\n\nAfter L to (4,5), then next would be D to (4,4), then D to (4,3), then D to (4,2).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving L to (4,5)?\n- No walls or obstacles there.\n- No body collision.\n- No food at (4,5) to cause tail reward danger.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (5,4) is safe but doesn't help us get closer to food as directly.\n\nMoving R to (6,5) is safe but takes us away from the food.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate move to start heading towards the closest and most sustainable food at (4,2) is to move Left (L) to (4,5).\n\n### Verifying Other Options\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider moving Down to (5,4):\n- Then next moves could be L to (4,4), then D to (4,3), then D to (4,2).\n- This also reaches (4,2) in the same number of steps (4 total), but the first move doesn't align as directly towards the food.\n\nMoving Right to (6,5):\n- Takes us away from the food, not optimal.\n\nThus, Left is the most direct first move towards the target food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(5,1): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,5), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L): (4,5) → (3,5)\n- New head position: (3,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so x=3 is safe. No internal obstacles at (3,5).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (5,5), (5,6), (6,6). (3,5) is not in these.\n- Food at (3,5)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U): (4,5) → (4,6)\n- New head position: (4,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is at y=7, y=6 is safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: Check if (4,6) is an obstacle. Obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (4,6) is not listed.\n  - Body: (4,6) is not in [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6)].\n- Food at (4,6)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D): (4,5) → (4,4)\n- New head position: (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, y=4 is safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is not listed as an obstacle.\n  - Body: (4,4) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (4,4)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. So, we need to think about positioning the snake to reach food in future turns.\n\nLet's look at the food positions relative to the head at (4,5):\n\n1. (6,1): Far away, not immediately reachable.\n2. (3,2): To reach this, we'd need to move left then down.\n3. (4,2): Directly below, but need to move down twice.\n4. (5,1): To the left and down.\n\nGiven that, moving left to (3,5) doesn't seem to help reach any food soon. Moving up to (4,6) also doesn't help. Moving down to (4,4) gets us closer to (4,2) and (3,2).\n\n### Potential Path to Food\n\nFrom (4,4), next moves could be:\n- Down to (4,3): then down to (4,2) to eat the food at (4,2).\n- Left to (3,4): but (3,4) is an internal obstacle, so can't go there.\n- Right to (5,4): then down to (5,3), etc., but not directly helpful.\n\nSo, moving down to (4,4) seems the best to eventually reach (4,2).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to ensure that if we eat food, the new tail doesn't collide with the head. Currently, the tail is at (6,6), which is far from the head. The only food that could cause this is if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food. Currently, the tail is at (6,6), head at (4,5), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven all possible moves are safe but none immediately reach food, moving down seems the best to position for future food at (4,2).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 20 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, any move that would take the snake to these coordinates is invalid (wall collision).\n- Internal obstacles (walls) at: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). These are also off-limits.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]\n  - Head at (4,4)\n  - Next segment at (4,5)\n  - Then (5,5)\n  - Tail at (5,6)\n- Current direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn (from (4,5) to (4,4)).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\nEach food is represented as (x, y, life_span, value):\n- (6,1): life=1, value=1 (positive)\n- (3,2): life=3, value=1 (positive)\n- (4,2): life=6, value=1 (positive)\n- (5,1): life=9, value=1 (positive)\nAll foods are positive (+1 score, length +1), none are negative in this case.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is D (down), the opposite is U (up). So, cannot move U next.\n- Possible moves: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n\n**Deadly Collisions:**\n- Cannot move into any body segment except the tail (since the tail will move forward).\n- Current body segments (excluding head): (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n  - So, cannot move to (4,5) unless it's the tail and we're moving in a way that the tail moves away.\n- Cannot move into walls (borders or internal obstacles).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nCurrent head at (4,4). Possible moves from here:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (4,3):**\n   - Check for walls: (4,3) is not listed as a wall (internal or border).\n   - Check for body: Snake body is at (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). (4,3) is not in these.\n   - Food at (4,3)? No food listed there.\n   - Valid move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (3,4):**\n   - Check walls: (3,4) is an internal obstacle (from the list). So, cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (5,4):**\n   - Check walls: (5,4) is not listed as a wall.\n   - Check body: (5,5) is part of the body, but (5,4) is not.\n   - Food at (5,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Valid move, no immediate reward.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards any food is possible and beneficial.\n\n**Food Positions:**\n1. (6,1): life=1\n   - Distance from head (4,4): |6-4| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps away.\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Not reachable this turn.\n   \n2. (3,2): life=3\n   - Distance: |3-4| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps away.\n   - Life span 3, so it will disappear in 3 turns (including this one).\n   - To reach in 3 turns, need to move towards it.\n   - Current move towards it: from (4,4), to get closer, could go left (but left is blocked by wall at (3,4)), or down to (4,3), then next turn towards (3,3) or (4,2), etc.\n   - Not directly reachable this turn.\n\n3. (4,2): life=6\n   - Distance: |4-4| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2 steps away.\n   - Life span 6, so plenty of time.\n   - Directly below head: from (4,4), down to (4,3), then down to (4,2).\n   - Can reach in 2 turns.\n   - Current move: down to (4,3) is valid.\n\n4. (5,1): life=9\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps away.\n   - Life span 9, so plenty of time.\n   - To reach: could go right to (5,4), then down to (5,3), etc.\n   - Not directly reachable this turn.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger:**\n- Check if any food is adjacent to the tail and is positive.\n- Tail is at (5,6). Adjacent cells:\n  - (5,5) - part of body\n  - (4,6), (5,7), (6,6)\n    - (5,7) is y=7, which is a wall.\n    - (4,6) and (6,6): no food listed there.\n- So no food adjacent to tail that could cause tail reward danger.\n\n### Deciding Between D and R\n\nFrom current head (4,4):\n\n- **D to (4,3):**\n  - Next step towards (4,2) food (life=6).\n  - Safe move, no immediate reward but setting up for food in next move.\n\n- **R to (5,4):**\n  - Not directly towards any immediate food.\n  - Maybe towards (5,1) in future, but that's further away.\n  - No immediate benefit.\n\nBetween these, moving D towards (4,2) food seems better, as it's the closest reachable food with sufficient life span.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten this turn? For that, the head must move onto a food cell that is not under the snake's body (or if it is, the body must move away first).\n\nCurrent food positions:\n- (6,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1)\nNone of these are at (4,4) (head) or under the body (body at (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)), so no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions\n\nFor move D to (4,3):\n- Next head position: (4,3)\n- Body will move to: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) (tail was at (5,6), now moves to (5,5)? Wait, let's see:\nOriginal body: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]\nAfter move D:\n- New head: (4,3)\n- Body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n- Tail (5,6) is removed (since length doesn't increase unless eating food).\nSo new positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\nNo collision: head at (4,3) not in [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)].\n\nSimilarly for R to (5,4):\n- New head: (5,4)\n- Body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\nNo collision: (5,4) not in [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)].\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of collision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween D and R, moving D is more strategic as it moves towards the food at (4,2) which can be eaten in the next move. Moving R doesn't provide an immediate path to food.\n\n### Potential Oversights\n\n- Is there any immediate danger in moving D?\n  - After moving D to (4,3), next moves could be D to (4,2) to eat food.\n  - Then, length increases by 1, so tail doesn't move, but since we're eating at (4,2), new tail would be at (5,5), and head at (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5).\n  - Need to ensure that after eating, the next move doesn't cause collision.\n  - But that's for future turns; current move is safe.\n\n- Is there any food under the snake's body that could be eaten?\n  - Current body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n  -\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

Also, not in internal obstacles.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (4,2) is not in these.\n   - Food at (4,2): Yes, there's positive food here with value 1.\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger: After eating, the snake grows by 1, so new tail would be where the current tail is (5,5) moves to (5,5)? Wait, no: the tail moves forward unless we eat, then the tail stays where it is (since a new segment is added at the head).\n     - Original length is 4, after eating becomes 5. The new tail would be the old second-to-last segment, which is (4,5). So new tail is (4,5).\n     - Head moves to (4,2), new body is [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)].\n     - Is head adjacent to new tail? Tail is at (4,5), head at (4,2). Distance is |4-4| + |5-2| = 3, not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1). So no danger.\n   - So moving Down to (4,2) is safe and gets +1 score.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (3,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (3,3) is not in these.\n   - Food at (3,3): No food listed here.\n   - This move is safe but doesn't get any food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (5,3) is not in these.\n   - Food at (5,3): No food listed here.\n   - This move is safe but doesn't get any food.\n\n### Comparing the Options\n\n- Down (D) to (4,2): +1 score, safe.\n- Left (L) to (3,3): safe, no score.\n- Right (R) to (5,3): safe, no score.\n\nClearly, moving Down to eat the food at (4,2) is the best option as it increases the score without any risks.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's re-examine the Tail Reward Danger for moving to (4,2):\n\n- Current snake: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n- After moving Down (D) and eating:\n  - New head: (4,2)\n  - New body: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n  - New tail is (4,5) (since we added a segment, the tail doesn't move).\n  - Distance between head (4,2) and tail (4,5): |4-4| + |2-5| = 3, not adjacent.\n  - So no danger.\n\n### Other Food Considerations\n\nOther foods:\n- (3,2): life_span=3, so it will disappear in 3 turns.\n- (5,1): life_span=8, so it will disappear in 8 turns.\nBut currently, only (4,2) is reachable in one move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), next moves could aim for (3,2) or (5,1), but that's for future turns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (4,2), which is safe and increases the score.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: Opposite of current direction → Not allowed (instant reverse).\n- **Down (D)**: Continue in the same direction.\n- **Left (L)**: Perpendicular to current direction.\n- **Right (R)**: Perpendicular to current direction.\n\nSo, valid moves are D, L, R.\n\n#### Evaluating Each Move:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: Move head from (4,2) to (4,1).\n   - Check for walls: (4,1) is not a border wall (y=1 is not y=0 or y=7).\n   - Check for obstacles: No internal obstacles at (4,1).\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - New head position: (4,1)\n     - Body segments after move: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) [tail moves from (5,5) to (4,5)]\n     - Does (4,1) collide with any body segment? No, since body is at (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n   - Food at (4,1)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move head from (4,2) to (3,2).\n   - Check for walls: (3,2) is not a border wall.\n   - Check for obstacles: No internal obstacles at (3,2).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - New head position: (3,2)\n     - Body segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n     - Does (3,2) collide with any body segment? No.\n   - Food at (3,2)? Yes, with value=1, life_span=2.\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger: \n       - Tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to head (distance is more than 1).\n       - So, no danger from tail food.\n     - Eating food: \n       - Length increases by 1.\n       - New snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (tail stays at (5,5) because length increases).\n   - Outcome: Eats positive food, safe.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move head from (4,2) to (5,2).\n   - Check for walls: (5,2) is not a border wall.\n   - Check for obstacles: No internal obstacles at (5,2).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - New head position: (5,2)\n     - Body segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n     - Does (5,2) collide with any body segment? No.\n   - Food at (5,2)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, no food.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe, eats positive food.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, no food.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating positive food when safe. Between L and R, L allows eating food at (3,2).\n\n### Checking Food Lifespan\n\nFood at (3,2) has life_span=2. Current turn is 22. It will disappear at turn 22 + 2 = turn 24. Since we're at turn 22, it will disappear after 2 more turns (including current), so it's safe to eat now.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Danger After Eating\n\nAfter eating at (3,2), the snake grows to length 6:\n- New positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\nNext move, the tail moves from (5,5) to (4,5), so no collision with head unless head moves to (4,5), which is not adjacent to (3,2).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to eat the positive food at (3,2) safely.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 23  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]  \n- Head is at (3,2), tail is at (5,5).\n- Current direction is Left (L), meaning the head moved from (4,2) to (3,2) last turn.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,1): value = 1, life_span = 6\n2. (2,5): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the grid with the snake and food positions.\n\n- Snake body:\n  - Head: (3,2)\n  - Body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n  \n- Food:\n  - (5,1)\n  - (2,5)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (3-1, 2) = (2,2)\n   - Check if (2,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: borders are x=0,7; y=0,7. (2,2) is within bounds.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (2,2) is not in this list.\n     - Not colliding with body: snake body is at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (2,2) is not in these.\n   - Safe to move to (2,2).\n   - Is there food at (2,2)? No, food is at (5,1) and (2,5).\n   - So, moving left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3,3)\n   - Check (3,3):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Body segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (3,3) is not here.\n   - Safe to move to (3,3).\n   - Food at (3,3)? No.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3,1)\n   - Check (3,1):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Body segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (3,1) is not here.\n   - Safe to move to (3,1).\n   - Food at (3,1)? No.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if we can reach any of them safely in the next move.\n\n1. Food at (5,1):\n   - Current head at (3,2). To reach (5,1), possible paths:\n     - From (3,2), can go Right to (4,2), then Down to (4,1), then Right to (5,1) — but that's multiple moves.\n     - Or Down to (3,1), then Right to (4,1), then Right to (5,1).\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\n2. Food at (2,5):\n   - From (3,2), possible paths:\n     - Left to (2,2), then Up to (2,3), then Up to (2,4), then Up to (2,5) — but (2,4) is an obstacle!\n     - Wait, (2,4) is an obstacle, so cannot go from (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5).\n     - Alternative: Up to (3,3), then Left to (2,3), then Up to (2,4) — but again (2,4) is obstacle.\n   - Seems like (2,5) is blocked by the obstacle at (2,4). So cannot reach it directly.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,5). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5)\n\nHead is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (5,5). So no danger here.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves Further\n\nCurrently, all three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe but don't lead to food in one move. So, which is the best?\n\n- Left (L): (2,2)\n  - From (2,2), possible next moves:\n    - U: (2,3) — but (1,3) is obstacle, and (2,3) is safe.\n    - D: (2,1) — safe.\n    - L: (1,2) — x=1 is not a border, but check obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (1,3). (1,2) is safe.\n    - R: (3,2) — but that's where the body is at (4,2), so (3,2) is now body segment (since head moves to (2,2), body becomes [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ...]. Wait, no: original body is [(4,2), (4,3), ...], so after moving head to (2,2), new body is [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ...]. So (3,2) is now the first body segment after head. So moving back to (3,2) would collide with body. So R is invalid next move after L.\n  \n- Up (U): (3,3)\n  - From (3,3), possible next moves:\n    - U: (3,4) — but (3,4) is an obstacle.\n    - D: (3,2) — original head position, now body segment, so invalid (collision).\n    - L: (2,3) — safe.\n    - R: (4,3) — body segment (after move, body is [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), ...], so (4,3) is not in body yet. Wait, original body is [(4,2), (4,3), ...], so after moving head to (3,3), body is [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ...]. So (4,3) is in body. So R is invalid.\n  \n- Down (D): (3,1)\n  - From (3,1), possible next moves:\n    - U: (3,2) — body segment, invalid.\n    - D: (3,0) — y=0 is border, invalid.\n    - L: (2,1) — safe.\n    - R: (4,1) — safe.\n\nComparing these:\n- Moving Left leads to (2,2), from where we can go L, U, D next turn.\n- Moving Up leads to (3,3), from where we can only go L next turn.\n- Moving Down leads to (3,1), from where we can go L or R next turn.\n\nMoving Left seems to give more options next turn. Also, moving towards the center might be better for future flexibility.\n\n### Checking for Future Food Access\n\nFood at (5,1) and (2,5):\n- (5,1): To reach it, moving Down first might help, but it's still multiple moves away.\n- (2,5): Blocked by obstacle at (2,4), so not reachable directly.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems reasonable to keep options open.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, moving Left is safe and maintains flexibility for future moves. Neither Up nor Down offer immediate benefits, and Left doesn't lead to any immediate dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(2, 5): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), we cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (2,2) → (1,2)\n   - Check for walls: (1,2) is not listed as a wall (border walls are x=0, not x=1).\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (1,2) is not in the body.\n   - Check for food: No food at (1,2).\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (2,2) → (2,3)\n   - Check walls: (2,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Snake body at (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is not in the body.\n   - Check food: No food at (2,3).\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (2,2) → (2,1)\n   - Check walls: (2,1) is not a wall (y=0 is wall, y=1 is not).\n   - Check body: (2,1) is not in the body.\n   - Check food: No food at (2,1).\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\nCurrently, all possible moves (L, U, D) are safe but don't lead to eating food. However, let's think about the food positions and how we might reach them in future turns.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\n1. Food at (5,1):\n   - Current position: (2,2)\n   - To reach (5,1), we'd need to go right and down. But current direction is left, and we can't go right next move.\n   - Maybe plan to go down first, then right in subsequent turns.\n\n2. Food at (2,5):\n   - Current position: (2,2)\n   - To reach (2,5), we'd need to go up three times.\n   - From (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5)\n   - But (2,4) is an internal obstacle (wall), so we can't go to (2,4). Hence, can't reach (2,5) directly.\n\nSo, the food at (2,5) is unreachable due to the wall at (2,4). The only reachable food is at (5,1), but we can't go towards it immediately because we can't go right this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that we could eat by moving the tail?\n- The tail is at (4,5). Is there food at (4,5)? No, food is at (5,1) and (2,5).\n- So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nSince all immediate moves (L, U, D) are safe but don't eat food, and we can't go towards the reachable food this turn, we should choose a move that keeps options open for future turns.\n\n- Left (L) to (1,2): This might limit future options as we're moving towards the left border.\n- Up (U) to (2,3): Moves us towards the center, more open space.\n- Down (D) to (2,1): Moves us towards the bottom border, slightly limiting.\n\nUp seems the best to keep more options open. Next turn, we can consider moving right towards the food at (5,1).\n\n### Verifying Up Move\n\nMove U to (2,3):\n- New head position: (2,3)\n- Body becomes: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] (tail at (4,4))\n- Next turn, possible moves from (2,3):\n  - Current direction will be U (since we moved up).\n  - Can't move D (reverse).\n  - Possible: U (to (2,4)), but (2,4) is a wall. So can't.\n  - L to (1,3): (1,3) is a wall. Can't.\n  - R to (3,3): Not a wall, not in body (body is (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)). Safe.\n  \nSo next turn, we can move R to (3,3), then possibly down towards (5,1).\n\n### Alternative: Down Move\n\nMove D to (2,1):\n- New head: (2,1)\n- Body: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] (tail at (4,4))\n- Next turn, from (2,1), direction D:\n  - Can't move U.\n  - D to (2,0): y=0 is wall. Can't.\n  - L to (1,1): Not wall, not body. Safe.\n  - R to (3,1): Not wall, not body. Safe.\n  \nFrom here, we could move R to (3,1), then R to (4,1), then R to (5,1) to eat the food.\n\nThis seems like a better path towards the food at (5,1):\n\nCurrent: (2,2) D→ (2,1) R→ (3,1) R→ (4,1) R→ (5,1) eats food.\n\n### Comparing Up vs Down\n\n- Up: Next move can only be R to (3,3), then need to go down to reach (5,1), which might be longer.\n- Down: Can go right next turn, directly towards food.\n\nDown seems more direct towards the food.\n\n### Checking Left Move\n\nMove L to (1,2):\n- New head: (1,2)\n- Body: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] (tail at (4,4))\n- Next turn, from (1,2), direction L:\n  - Can't move R.\n  - L to (0,2): x=0 is wall. Can't.\n  - U to (1,3): (1,3) is wall. Can't.\n  - D to (1,1): Not wall, not body. Safe.\n  \nThen D to (1,1), then can go R to (2,1), etc., but this seems less direct towards food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most promising immediate move is **Down (D)**, as it allows us to start moving right in the next turn towards the food at (5,1).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 25 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: It's an 8x8 grid (since x and y go from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles at: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)].\n   - Current head direction: Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=4.\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - (4,6): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position on the grid to better understand possible moves.\n\n- Snake segments:\n  - Head: (2,1)\n  - Next: (2,2)\n  - Then: (3,2)\n  - Then: (4,2)\n  - Then: (4,3)\n  - Tail: (4,4)\n\nCurrent direction is Down (D), meaning the snake was moving in the negative y-direction (since (2,2) to (2,1) is down).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,1), possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2,1) → (2,2)\n   - But (2,2) is the next segment of the snake's body. This would cause a collision (head touches body), so this is deadly.\n   \n2. **Down (D)**: (2,1) → (2,0)\n   - y=0 is a border wall, so this is a wall collision → deadly.\n   \n3. **Left (L)**: (2,1) → (1,1)\n   - Need to check if (1,1) is a wall or part of the snake.\n   - Walls at x=0, but x=1 is not a border wall.\n   - Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) — none at (1,1).\n   - Snake body: positions are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — none at (1,1).\n   - So, (1,1) is safe.\n   \n4. **Right (R)**: (2,1) → (3,1)\n   - Check (3,1):\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3,4) is the only one at x=3, but y=1 is clear.\n     - Snake body: none at (3,1).\n     - So, (3,1) is safe.\n\nHowever, the snake's current direction is Down (D), and the rule says:\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n- Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So U is not allowed (but we already saw it's deadly anyway).\n- So, possible non-deadly moves are L and R.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see if moving L or R can lead us to food:\n\n1. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Current head is at (2,1).\n   - To reach (5,1), need to move right three times: (2,1)→(3,1)→(4,1)→(5,1).\n   - But we're deciding only the immediate next move.\n   - Moving R to (3,1) doesn't reach any food directly.\n   \n2. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - Current head is at (2,1).\n   - To reach (2,5), need to move up four times: (2,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(2,4)→(2,5).\n   - But first move U is deadly (into body at (2,2)), so can't go this way directly.\n   \n3. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Current head is at (2,1).\n   - To reach (4,6), need to move right and up: e.g., (2,1)→(3,1)→(4,1)→(4,2)→(4,3)→(4,4)→(4,5)→(4,6).\n   - But (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are part of the snake's body, so moving into them would be deadly unless it's the tail moving away.\n   - Seems complicated to reach this food immediately.\n\nSo, immediate moves L or R don't directly reach any food. But we should also consider if moving in a certain direction sets us up to reach food in future moves.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (4,4).\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (2,1), tail at (4,4).\n  - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1, or same y and x differs by 1.\n  - (2,1) and (4,4): x differs by 2, y differs by 3 → not adjacent.\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Choosing Between L and R\n\nBoth L to (1,1) and R to (3,1) are safe. Which is better?\n\n1. **Moving Left (L) to (1,1)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (1,1):\n     - Current direction would be L (since we moved left).\n     - Can't move R (opposite of L).\n     - U: (1,1)→(1,2) — check:\n       - (1,2): not a wall, not in snake body (snake is at (2,1), (2,2), etc.), not an obstacle.\n       - Safe.\n     - D: (1,1)→(1,0) — y=0 is wall → deadly.\n     - L: (1,1)→(0,1) — x=0 is wall → deadly.\n     - So from (1,1), only U is safe next move.\n   \n2. **Moving Right (R) to (3,1)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,1):\n     - Current direction would be R.\n     - Can't move L (opposite of R).\n     - U: (3,1)→(3,2) — check:\n       - (3,2) is part of the snake's body (third segment) → deadly.\n     - D: (3,1)→(3,0) — y=0 is wall → deadly.\n     - R: (3,1)→(4,1) — check:\n       - (4,1): not a wall, not in snake body (snake is up to (4,4)), not an obstacle.\n       - Safe.\n     - So from (3,1), only R is safe next move.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Moving L leads to only U next, which doesn't seem to lead towards food directly.\n- Moving R leads to only R next, which can eventually lead towards food at (5,1) if we keep moving right.\n\nAlso, moving R to (3,1) is closer to (5,1), which is food with life_span=4 (so it will disappear in 4 turns). We can reach it in 3 moves (current move R to (3,1), then R to (4,1), then R to (5,1)), which is within the life_span.\n\nMoving L seems to lead us into a corner with fewer options in the next steps.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head or Adjacent\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that we can eat by moving away and then back?\n- Current head is at (2,1). No food is listed at (2,1).\n- Adjacent cells to head (2,1):\n  - (1,1), (3,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n  - (2,0) is wall, (2,2) is snake body.\n  - (1,1) and (3,1) have no food listed.\nSo, no immediate food to eat by moving away and back.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween L and R, moving R seems better because:\n- It's safe.\n- It allows us to potentially reach the food at (5,1) in future moves within its life_span.\n- Moving L seems to limit our options more in the next steps.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 26  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls).\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]  \nThis means:\n- Head is at (3,1)\n- Body segments follow: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n- Tail is at (4,3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right)  \nThis means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5,1), value=1, life_span=3\n2. (2,5), value=1, life_span=6\n3. (4,6), value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,1) and current direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3,2)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,0)\n- **Left (L)**: (2,1)\n- **Right (R)**: (4,1)\n\nBut we cannot move opposite to the current direction immediately. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So, Left is not allowed.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3,2)\n   - Check if (3,2) is occupied by body or wall.\n   - Snake body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n     - (3,2) is part of the body (4th segment). So, moving here would collide with body. Deadly. Cannot do this.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (3,0)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a border wall. So, (3,0) is a wall. Cannot move here.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (4,1)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is border, but x=4 is fine.\n   - Check body: Is (4,1) in body? Current body positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n     - (4,1) is not in body.\n   - So, this move is safe in terms of collision.\n   - Now, is there food here? Food positions: (5,1), (2,5), (4,6)\n     - (4,1) is not a food position. So, no food here.\n\nSo, the only possible safe move is Right (R) to (4,1).\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other consideration, like food that might be under the snake's body that we can eat by moving away.\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- (3,1) is head\n- (2,1) is next\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (4,2)\n- (4,3)\n\nFood positions:\n1. (5,1) - not under body\n2. (2,5) - not under body\n3. (4,6) - not under body\n\nNo food is under the snake's body currently.\n\nAlso, check if moving right to (4,1) would make any food accessible next turn:\n- After moving to (4,1), next head is (4,1), direction R.\n- Then possible moves from (4,1):\n  - U: (4,2) - body is currently at (4,2), but tail is at (4,3). After moving to (4,1), the tail moves from (4,3) to (4,2)? Wait, let's see how snake moves:\n    - Current: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n    - Move R to (4,1):\n      - New head: (4,1)\n      - Remove tail: (4,3)\n      - New body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n    - So tail is now at (4,2)\n    - Then next move U from (4,1) would be to (4,2), which is tail. Normally, moving into tail is safe because tail moves away, but there's a special rule:\n      - **Tail Reward Danger**: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail will collide.\n      - Here, after moving to (4,1), tail is at (4,2). Is there food at (4,2)? No, current foods are at (5,1), (2,5), (4,6). So no danger from that.\n    - So U would be safe next turn, leading to (4,2), which is tail, but no food there, so no growth, so tail moves away, no collision.\n    - But no immediate benefit from moving R now in terms of food.\n\nIs there any other path? Only possible move is R to (4,1). Other moves lead to death.\n\nAlternatively, is there any past plan from t_1 <= t_0? The problem mentions \"Thinking Model's past plan generated at Turn t_1 <= t_0 (if available)\". But no past plan is provided here, so we can't consider that.\n\n### Verifying No Other Options\n\nIs there any way to not move into a dead end? Currently, only R is possible, leading to (4,1). From there, possible moves next turn would be U (4,2), D (4,0) - wall, L (3,1) - opposite of current R, so not allowed unless we change direction, but current direction is R, so after moving R, direction is R, so next turn cannot go L. So next turn from (4,1) can go U or R.\n\nGoing U to (4,2):\n- (4,2) is tail, no food, safe.\nGoing R to (5,1):\n- (5,1) is food with value +1, life_span 3.\n- After moving to (4,1), next turn move R to (5,1) eats food, length increases by 1, new tail is where? Original tail was (4,2), after eating, tail stays at (4,2), new segment added at head, so body becomes [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n- Then next move from (5,1), direction R, possible moves:\n  - U (5,2)\n  - D (5,0) - wall\n  - R (6,1)\n  - L (4,1) - opposite, not allowed\n  - (5,2) and (6,1) need to be checked for safety.\n\nThis seems like a possible path to get food at (5,1). So moving R now to (4,1) sets up to eat (5,1) next turn.\n\nAlternative is to not go for food and survive longer, but currently only R is possible, and it leads to a path where we can eat food next turn without immediate danger.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to current head (3,1) that we can eat this turn?\nAdjacent cells:\n- U (3,2) - body, cannot\n- D (3,0) - wall\n- L (2,1) - body\n- R (4,1) - no food\nSo no food to eat this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly possible safe move is Right (R) to (4,1), which also sets up to eat the food at (5,1) next turn if we choose to do so.\n\nTherefore, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The current direction is Right (R), so the opposite direction is Left (L), which is not allowed next. Therefore, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,1)\n- New head position: (6,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=6 is not a border wall. No internal walls at (6,1).\n  - Body: Check if (6,1) is in the snake's body segments. Current body segments: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). (6,1) is not in this list.\n- Food at (6,1)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,2)\n- New head position: (5,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, y=2 is not a border. No internal walls at (5,2).\n  - Body: Is (5,2) in the body? Current body: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). (5,2) is not present.\n- Food at (5,2)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,0)\n- New head position: (5,0)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a border wall. (5,0) is a wall.\n  - Body: Not relevant since it's a wall.\n- Outcome: Collision with wall - deadly, cannot choose this.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next move or if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n1. (2,5) - Value: 4, Life Span: 1\n   - Distance from head (5,1): |5-2| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 (Manhattan distance)\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n2.

(1,1) - Value: 10, Life Span: 1\n   - Distance: |5-1| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\nNone of the food is directly reachable in the next move. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move safely without colliding, possibly moving towards high-value food for future turns.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (4,2). Adjacent cells to the tail:\n- Up: (4,3)\n- Down: (4,1) - part of the body (segment after head)\n- Left: (3,2) - part of the body\n- Right: (5,2)\n\nIs there positive food adjacent to the tail?\n- Food at (4,6), (2,5), (1,1) - none adjacent to (4,2).\n- So no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (R and U):\n\n1. Move Right (R) to (6,1):\n   - Moves towards the right edge. Next possible moves would be U or R (can't reverse to L).\n   - Next possible moves from (6,1):\n     - U to (6,2)\n     - R to (7,1) - but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n     - D to (6,0) - y=0 is wall.\n   - So only U is possible next, which may limit options.\n\n2. Move Up (U) to (5,2):\n   - Opens more options for next moves:\n     - From (5,2), current direction is U (since we moved up).\n     - Next possible moves: U to (5,3), L to (4,2) - but (4,2) is the tail which will move, so it's safe unless the tail grows.\n     - Need to check if moving to (4,2) is safe:\n       - Tail is at (4,2), after move, tail moves from (4,2) to (3,2), so (4,2) is safe to move into.\n     - R to (6,2) is also possible.\n\nMoving Up seems to provide more flexibility for future moves compared to moving Right, which quickly leads to a dead end near the wall.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Up\n\nLet's ensure moving Up is safe regarding the tail:\n- Current tail is at (4,2).\n- After moving head to (5,2), the tail moves from (4,2) to (3,2).\n- New snake positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n- No immediate collision next turn unless we move into the new tail position, but that's a future consideration.\n\n### Considering Future Food Access\n\nMoving Up to (5,2) may position the snake better to reach the high-value food at (1,1) (value 10) in subsequent moves, as it's moving upwards towards y=1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, moving **Up (U)** is the safest and most strategic choice at this turn, as it avoids immediate collisions and maintains flexibility for future moves towards high-value food.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 29 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). These are additional walls inside the grid that the snake must avoid.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- **Positions (head first)**: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n  - Head: (5,2)\n  - Next segment: (5,1)\n  - Then: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) (tail)\n- **Current Direction**: U (Up, which is (x, y+1))\n\n**3. Food Items:**\nEach food is represented as (x, y, life_span, value):\n1. (2, 5, 3, 1) - Positive food at (2,5) with 3 turns left, value +1\n2. (4, 6, 6, 1) - Positive food at (4,6) with 6 turns left, value +1\n3. (1, 1, 9, -1) - Negative food at (1,1) with 9 turns left, value -1\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (Head at (5,2), Direction U)\n\nFrom direction U (Up), the possible moves are U, L, R (can't reverse to D immediately).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Move Up (U): (5,2) → (5,3)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (5,3) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,3) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n  - Body collision: Check if (5,3) is in snake positions [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] → No.\n- Food at (5,3)? No food listed there.\n- Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n**2. Move Left (L): (5,2) → (4,2)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left wall, (4,2) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,2) is not in the list.\n  - Body collision: Is (4,2) in snake positions? \n    - Snake positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) → (4,2) is not there.\n- Food at (4,2)? No food listed there.\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n**3. Move Right (R): (5,2) → (6,2)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is right wall, (6,2) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (6,2) is not in the list.\n  - Body collision: Is (6,2) in snake positions? No.\n- Food at (6,2)? No food listed there.\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. Let's see where the foods are and how we can plan to reach them:\n\n1. **(2,5)**: Positive food, life_span=3\n   - Current turn is 29, so it disappears at turn 29 + 3 = 32.\n   - Distance from head (5,2) to (2,5):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n     - To reach by turn 32, we have 3 turns (30,31,32). Need to cover 6 units in 3 turns → not possible (max is 3 units in 3 turns).\n   - **Cannot reach in time**.\n\n2. **(4,6)**: Positive food, life_span=6\n   - Disappears at turn 29 + 6 = 35.\n   - Distance from (5,2) to (4,6):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n     - Need to cover 5 units in 6 turns → possible.\n   - Possible path: Need to move towards (4,6). Currently at (5,2), need to decrease x and increase y.\n     - Next move could be L to (4,2), then U to (4,3), etc.\n\n3. **(1,1)**: Negative food, life_span=9\n   - Disappears at turn 29 + 9 = 38.\n   - We should avoid this since it's negative.\n\n### Deciding the Best Immediate Move\n\nGiven that:\n- (2,5) is unreachable.\n- (1,1) is negative and should be avoided.\n- (4,6) is reachable and positive.\n\nOur goal is to move towards (4,6). Currently at (5,2), (4,6) is to the left and up.\n\nPossible immediate moves towards (4,6):\n- Left (L) to (4,2): decreases x, same y.\n- Up (U) to (5,3): same x, increases y.\n\nBetween L and U:\n- L gets us closer in x-direction (from 5 to 4).\n- U gets us closer in y-direction (from 2 to 3).\n\nBoth are valid, but moving L first might be better because:\n- After L to (4,2), next move can be U to (4,3), then U to (4,4), etc., directly towards (4,6).\n- Moving U first to (5,3) would then require L to (4,3), which is also fine but might not be as direct.\n\nAlso, moving L now avoids potential future obstacles near (5,3), though currently, there are none.\n\n**Potential Issue with L to (4,2):**\n- After moving to (4,2), the tail is at (3,2), which is adjacent to head at (4,2).\n- Is there food at (3,2)? No, food is at (2,5), (4,6), (1,1).\n- So no risk of tail reward danger (since no food at tail).\n\n**Potential Issue with U to (5,3):**\n- After moving to (5,3), the tail is at (3,2), not adjacent to head.\n- Seems safe, but less direct towards (4,6).\n\nGiven that, moving L seems more direct towards the positive food at (4,6).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing L, let's ensure no immediate dangers:\n- Moving L to (4,2):\n  - Next turn, snake positions will be [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] (tail at (2,2)).\n  - Head at (4,2), adjacent cells:\n    - U: (4,3) - not in body.\n    - D: (4,1) - is in body (next segment after head is (5,2), then (5,1), then (4,1)), but (4,1) is the 4th segment, so not immediately adjacent to head after move.\n    - L: (3,2) - is the new tail (from original (3,2)), but tail moves to (2,2), so (3,2) is empty now.\n    - R: (5,2) - is the next segment after head, so cannot move R next turn (would reverse).\n  - So next turn after L, possible moves would be U, D, L (cannot go R opposite to L).\n\nNo immediate danger seen in moving L.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating:\n- Moving L is safe.\n- Moves us directly towards the positive food at (4,6).\n- No immediate risks or better alternatives.\n\n**Action**: \\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 30  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (4,2), then body segments at (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  \nSo the snake is 7 segments long.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2,5) - value: 2, life_span: 1\n2. (4,6) - value: 5, life_span: 1\n3. (1,1) - value: 8, life_span: 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,2) and direction L (Left), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (3,2)\n- **Up (U)**: (4,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,1)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse (opposite of current direction L), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's check each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (3,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: The snake's body is at [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]. (3,2) is not in this list.\n  - Walls: (3,2) is not a wall (internal obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)).\n- Food at (3,2)? No food listed there.\n- Next head position: (3,2)\n- This move is safe but doesn't get any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (4,3) is not in the body list.\n  - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n- Food at (4,3)? No food there.\n- Next head position: (4,3)\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (4,1) is the 4th segment of the snake (counting from head as 0). \n     - The tail is at (2,2), which will move to (2,1) when the head moves (since the snake grows only when eating positive food, and we're not eating here).\n     - But the head moving to (4,1) would collide with the body segment at (4,1), which is not the tail (tail is at (2,2)). So this is a body collision.\n- Therefore, moving Down is deadly.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move from the current head position (4,2):\n\n- (2,5): Distance from (4,2) is |4-2| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5 (too far for one move)\n- (4,6): Distance is |4-4| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4 (too far)\n- (1,1): Distance is |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4 (too far)\n\nNone of the food items are adjacent to the head, so we can't eat any this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nEven though no food is adjacent, let's understand this rule:\nIf the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it would kill the snake because the newly grown tail would collide with the head.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,2). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3)\n\nHead is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to (2,2) (distance is 2). So no danger here.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nAll food has life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So next turn, all current food will be gone. But since none are reachable this turn, it doesn't affect our decision.\n\n### Possible Moves Revisited\n\nFrom earlier:\n- Left (L) to (3,2): safe, no food\n- Up (U) to (4,3): safe, no food\n- Down (D) to (4,1): deadly\n\nBetween Left and Up, both are safe with no immediate reward. Which is better?\n\nLooking at future possibilities:\n- After Left to (3,2), next moves could be L to (2,2) (but tail is at (2,2) moving to (2,1), so (2,2) is safe), or U/D from (3,2).\n- After Up to (4,3), next moves could be U to (4,4), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\nBoth seem equally safe with no immediate advantage. Maybe choose Up to explore more of the board since moving Left keeps us near the body.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth Left and Up are safe; Down is deadly. Since no food is reachable this turn, and both moves are equally safe, I'll choose **Up** to potentially explore more space.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

But the snake's tail is at (2,1), so this food is under the tail.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,3) with Direction U\n\nFrom the current head position (4,3) and direction U (up, which is increasing y), the possible moves are U, L, R (cannot go D because that's the opposite of current direction U).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,4) is not a wall (no internal obstacle at (4,4), and not a border wall).\n     - Body: Snake body is at [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]. (4,4) is not in this list.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (3,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (3,3) is not in the body list.\n   - Food at (3,3)? No.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (5,3) is not in the body list.\n   - Food at (5,3)? No.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next move:\n\n1. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - Current head at (4,3). To reach (2,5) in one move, need to move left twice and up twice, which is impossible in one move. Not reachable next turn.\n\n2. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - From (4,3), can reach (4,6) in 3 moves (U, U, U). Not reachable next turn.\n\n3. **Food at (1,1)**:\n   - From (4,3), multiple moves away. Not reachable next turn.\n\n4. **Food at (2,1)**:\n   - Currently under the tail at (2,1). To eat this:\n     - The tail must move away first (i.e., the snake moves such that the tail is no longer at (2,1)).\n     - Then, the head can move to (2,1) to eat it.\n   - Currently, the tail is at (2,1). The next move will move the tail to (3,1) if the head moves away from (4,1). But the head is at (4,3), so moving the head doesn't directly affect the tail's next position unless the head moves in a way that the tail follows differently.\n   - Actually, the tail moves based on the head's movement. If the head moves, the last segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n   - Currently, the tail is at (2,1). The next move will remove (2,1) from the tail unless we eat food.\n   - To eat the food at (2,1), the head must move to (2,1) in the next move, but the head is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (2,1). So cannot eat it next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nNone of the foods are directly reachable in the next move. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move safely towards potential food or to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Checking for Dangerous Moves\n\nAre any of the possible moves dangerous in the long run?\n\n1. **Move U to (4,4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,4) with direction U:\n     - U to (4,5): Check walls/body. (4,5) is clear.\n     - L to (3,4): Internal obstacle at (3,4) → cannot move there.\n     - R to (5,4): Clear.\n   - So from (4,4), can go U or R next.\n\n2. **Move L to (3,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,3) with direction L:\n     - U to (3,4): Obstacle at (3,4) → cannot.\n     - L to (2,3): Check walls/body. (2,3) is clear.\n     - D to (3,2): Opposite of current direction (U) is D, which is not allowed unless current move is not U.\n     - Wait, current direction is U, and we're moving L, so new direction is L. Then next moves cannot be R (opposite of L).\n     - From (3,3), direction L, can go U, L, D.\n       - U to (3,4): obstacle.\n       - L to (2,3): clear.\n       - D to (3,2): clear.\n   - So from (3,3), can go L or D next.\n\n3. **Move R to (5,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (5,3) with direction R:\n     - U to (5,4): clear.\n     - R to (6,3): clear (not a wall, not in body).\n     - D to (5,2): body at (5,2) → collision.\n   - So from (5,3), can go U or R next.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately reachable, we should choose a move that keeps options open and avoids potential traps.\n\n- **Move U to (4,4)**:\n  - Next can go U or R.\n  - Moving towards food at (4,6) in future moves.\n\n- **Move L to (3,3)**:\n  - Next can go L or D.\n  - Moving towards food at (2,5) in future moves, but that food disappears next turn.\n\n- **Move R to (5,3)**:\n  - Next can go U or R.\n  - Moving towards right side, but no immediate food there.\n\n**Best option seems Move U to (4,4)**, as it moves towards the food at (4,6) which has a life_span of 4, giving us time to reach it in future moves.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any tail reward danger? The food at (2,1) is under the tail. To eat it, the head would need to move to (2,1), but it's not adjacent now. So no immediate danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest and most strategic move is to go Up (U) to (4,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(4,6): value=1, life_span=4\n2. (1,1): value=1, life_span=6\n3. (2,1): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Up (U). The possible moves are Up (U), Left (L), or Right (R). Moving Down (D) is not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (U).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (4,4) to (4,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,5) is not a border wall (y=7 is the top border).\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is not listed as an obstacle.\n     - Body: The body segments are at (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). (4,5) is not occupied by any body segment.\n   - Food at (4,5): No food is listed at (4,5).\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (4,4) to (3,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,4) is not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3,4) is listed as an obstacle → **Collision**.\n   - Not a valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (4,4) to (5,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,4) is not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,4) is not listed as an obstacle.\n     - Body: (5,4) is not occupied by any body segment.\n   - Food at (5,4): No food is listed at (5,4).\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, the available foods are at:\n- (4,6): value=1, life_span=4\n- (1,1): value=1, life_span=6\n- (2,1): value=1, life_span=9\n\n**Food at (4,6)**:\n- Current head at (4,4). To reach (4,6), path could be:\n  - U to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n  - But need to ensure that after first move, the path remains safe.\n- After first move U to (4,5), next move would be U to (4,6):\n  - Check if (4,6) is safe at that time:\n    - Tail is currently at (3,1). After moving U to (4,5), the tail will move to (4,1) (since the body moves forward).\n    - Next move to (4,6): \n      - Body segments will be [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)].\n      - (4,6) is not in body segments.\n      - No walls or obstacles at (4,6).\n      - Eating (4,6) increases length by 1, new tail would be (4,1), which is not adjacent to head at (4,6), so no immediate collision.\n  - However, we can only plan the immediate next move, not a sequence. So moving U now is a step toward (4,6).\n\n**Other Foods**:\n- (1,1) and (2,1) are far away (distance of 3 and 2 in x, and 3 in y). Not immediately reachable.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving U to (4,5) is safe now, but next move to (4,6) needs to be safe then.\n- Moving R to (5,4) is safe now, but doesn't lead directly to food.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and R, both are safe immediately, but U is a step toward the food at (4,6), while R doesn't lead to food directly. \n\n**Potential Issue**: After moving U to (4,5), the next move to (4,6) would be eating the food. But we need to ensure that the tail is not adjacent to the head after growth:\n- Current tail is at (3,1). After first move U to (4,5), tail moves to (4,1).\n- After eating at (4,6), new tail is (4,1), head at (4,6). Distance is (4,6) to (4,1) is 5 in y, not adjacent. So safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate move is **Up (U)**, as it is safe and moves toward the nearest positive food at (4,6).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are Up (U), Left (L), or Right (R). Moving Down (D) would be the opposite direction, which is not allowed.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (4,6).\n   - Check if (4,6) is a wall: No, it's not a border wall or an internal obstacle.\n   - Check if (4,6) is part of the snake's body: The snake's body is at (4,5), (4,4), etc., not (4,6).\n   - Check for food at (4,6): Yes, there's positive food with value=1.\n     - **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to the head (4,5). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,5) is adjacent to (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5). The tail is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to (4,5). So no danger here.\n     - Eating this food would increase length by 1, and the tail would not move this turn (since the snake grows before moving the tail).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Up and eat the food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (3,5).\n   - Check walls: (3,5) is not a border wall. Internal obstacles are at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (3,5) is not in this list.\n   - Check snake body: Snake is at (4,5), (4,4), etc. (3,5) is not in the body.\n   - Check food: No food at (3,5).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (5,5).\n   - Check walls: (5,5) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n   - Check snake body: Snake is at (5,2), (5,1), etc. (5,5) is not in the body.\n   - Check food: No food at (5,5).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\n- **Up (U)**: Immediate reward (+1), safe.\n- **Left (L)**: No reward, safe.\n- **Right (R)**: No reward, safe.\n\nGiven that moving Up provides an immediate positive reward without any danger, it's the best choice. The other moves are safe but don't provide any immediate benefit.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm that eating the food at (4,6) doesn't cause a collision with the tail after growth:\n- Current tail is at (4,1).\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the tail stays at (4,1) this turn.\n- Next turn, the tail would move forward, but since the head is at (4,6), and the new segment is added where the head was (4,5), the tail is far away at (4,1), moving towards (4,2) next turn. No collision risk.\n\n### Checking Other Food\n\nThe other foods are at (1,1) and (2,1), which are quite far from the current head position (4,5). Moving towards them would require multiple moves, and the immediate food at (4,6) is more advantageous to take now.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nAfter moving Up to (4,6), the next moves could be:\n- Left to (3,6) or Right to (5,6), but both are towards the edges where there's no food immediately visible.\n- Down would be back to (4,5), but that's the previous head position, now part of the body, so that's not allowed (would cause collision).\n  \nBut since we're only deciding the immediate action, we don't need to plan further here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the positive food at (4,6), as it's safe and provides a reward.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 34  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and these borders are walls)\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (4,6), then the body follows as: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)  \nSo the snake is quite long, with 8 segments.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U). This means the last move was from (4,5) to (4,6).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1,1): value = 1, life_span = 4\n2. (2,1): value = 1, life_span = 7\n3. (5,4): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,6) and moving Up (U), the possible next moves are:\n- Up (U): (4,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so this is invalid (wall collision)\n- Down (D): (4,5) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so moving here would cause a collision (unless it's the tail, which it's not)\n- Left (L): (3,6)\n- Right (R): (5,6)\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are L or R.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nLet's see where the food is relative to the head:\n1. (1,1): Far away, not reachable immediately.\n2. (2,1): Also far away.\n3. (5,4): This is at x=5, y=4. Our head is at (4,6). To reach (5,4), we'd need to go Right then Down twice, but that's not immediate.\n\nSo, no immediate food to eat in the next move.\n\n### Avoiding Collisions\n\nWe need to ensure that moving L or R doesn't lead us into a body segment or a wall.\n\n- Move L to (3,6):\n  - Check if (3,6) is in snake body: No, the body is at (4,5), (4,4), etc., not (3,6).\n  - Check if (3,6) is a wall: No walls at (3,6).\n  - Safe.\n\n- Move R to (5,6):\n  - Check if (5,6) is in snake body: No.\n  - Check if (5,6) is a wall: No walls at (5,6).\n  - Safe.\n\nBoth L and R seem safe. Now, let's think about future moves.\n\n### Future Moves Consideration\n\nAfter moving L or R, where can we go next?\n\n**If we go L to (3,6):**\nNext moves from (3,6):\n- U: (3,7) — wall\n- D: (3,5) — check if it's body or wall:\n  - Snake body: (4,5), (4,4), etc. (3,5) is not in the body.\n  - Walls: (3,4) is a wall, but (3,5) is not.\n  - So D is possible.\n- L: (2,6) — check:\n  - Not in body, not a wall.\n- R: (4,6) — current head position, which will be empty after moving, but the body is moving, so (4,6) will be empty unless the tail is there. The tail is at (4,1), so (4,6) is safe.\n  \nSo from (3,6), we'd have options D, L, R.\n\n**If we go R to (5,6):**\nNext moves from (5,6):\n- U: (5,7) — wall\n- D: (5,5) — check:\n  - Not in body (body is at (5,2), (5,1), etc.), not a wall.\n- L: (4,6) — as above, should be safe.\n- R: (6,6) — not a wall, not in body.\n\nOptions D, L, R.\n\n### Choosing Between L and R\n\nBoth seem equally safe in terms of immediate movement. Let's see if one leads us closer to food.\n\nFood at (5,4):\n- From (4,6), going R to (5,6), then D to (5,5), then D to (5,4) would reach the food in 3 moves.\n- From (4,6), going L to (3,6), then paths to (5,4) are longer.\n\nSo R seems slightly better as it's on the same x-coordinate as the food at (5,4), making it easier to reach later.\n\nAlso, food at (5,4) has life_span=10, so it will disappear at turn 44 (current turn is 34), so we have time to reach it.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail has positive food. Currently, the tail is at (4,1), and the head is at (4,6), not adjacent. So no danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween L and R, R seems slightly better as it aligns with the x-coordinate of the food at (5,4), making future moves towards it more straightforward. Both are safe immediately.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(5,4) - value: 9, life_span: 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head: (5,6)\n  - Body: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)\n  \n  The snake is moving right, so the head just moved from (4,6) to (5,6). The tail is at (5,1), and the segment before the tail is (5,2).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1): Positive food (value 3), disappears next turn (life_span 1)\n  - (2,1): Positive food (value 6), disappears next turn\n  - (5,4): Positive food (value 9), disappears next turn\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,6) and current direction R (Right), the possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), R (Right). We cannot move L (Left) because that would be an instant reverse (opposite of R), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Right (R)**: to (6,6)\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is a wall, so x=6 is within bounds.\n   - Check for body collision: Is (6,6) in the snake's body?\n     - Current body positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)\n     - (6,6) is not in the body.\n   - Is there food at (6,6)? No.\n   - So, moving R is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Move Up (U)**: to (5,7)\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is a wall, so (5,7) is a wall cell. Cannot move here.\n   - So, U is invalid.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**: to (5,5)\n   - Check for walls: y=5 is within bounds (y=0 to y=7).\n   - Check for body collision: Is (5,5) in the snake's body?\n     - Current body: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)\n     - (5,5) is not in the body.\n   - Is there food at (5,5)? No.\n   - So, moving D is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, the food items are at (1,1), (2,1), and (5,4). None of these are adjacent to the head at (5,6), so we can't eat any food this turn regardless of our move.\n\nHowever, let's check if any food is under the snake's body that could be eaten by moving away:\n\n- Food at (5,4):\n  - Is (5,4) under the snake's body? Current body positions include (4,4), but not (5,4). Wait, looking at the snake positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. So (5,4) is not under the snake's body.\n  \n- Similarly, (1,1) and (2,1) are not under the snake's body.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten this turn by moving onto it directly or by uncovering it.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,1). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2)\nHead is at (5,6), which is not adjacent to (5,1). So no danger here.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nAll food has life_span 1, meaning they will disappear next turn. So if we don't eat them now, they're gone. But none are reachable this turn, so that's unavoidable.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nOur options are R or D (U is invalid).\n\n- R: to (6,6)\n  - Safe, no food.\n- D: to (5,5)\n  - Safe, no food.\n\nBoth moves are safe and don't lead to food. Which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- After R to (6,6), next moves could be R (to (7,6) - wall, invalid), U (to (6,7) - wall), D (to (6,5)).\n- After D to (5,5), next moves could be L (to (4,5) - but current direction is R, so L is reverse, invalid unless we change direction now), R (to (6,5)), D (to (5,4)).\n\nAt (5,5), next turn food at (5,4) will be gone (life_span 1), but if we move D to (5,5), then next turn we can move D to (5,4) if food is still there, but it won't be.\n\nAlternatively, moving R to (6,6) opens up more options next turn, like moving D to (6,5), which is closer to the center.\n\nGiven that, moving R seems slightly better as it keeps more options open for future moves.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\nLet's ensure that moving R or D doesn't lead to immediate danger next turn.\n\n- If R to (6,6):\n  - Next turn, snake will be [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), ..., (5,1)]\n  - Possible moves from (6,6): R (to (7,6) - wall), U (to (6,7) - wall), D (to (6,5))\n  - Moving D to (6,5) is safe (not in body).\n  \n- If D to (5,5):\n  - Next turn, snake will be [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), ..., (5,1)]\n  - Possible moves from (5,5): R (to (6,5)), D (to (5,4)), L (to (4,5) - but current direction was R, then D, so L is not reverse, but original direction was R, then D, so next move's \"current direction\" is D, so opposite is U, so L is allowed)\n    - Wait, direction tracking: original direction was R, then we moved D, so new direction is D. So opposite is U, so L and R are allowed.\n    - Moving L to (4,5): is (4,5) in body? Current body after move is (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc., so (4,5) is in body. So cannot move L.\n    - Moving R to (6,5): safe.\n    - Moving D to (5,4): is (5,4) in body? Body will be (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), etc., so (5,4) is not in body. But food at (5,4) will be gone next turn, so no benefit.\n  \nBetween the two, moving R seems to keep more options open next turn without restricting movement as much.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both possible moves (R and D), moving **Right (R)** seems slightly better as it keeps more options open for future moves without immediate danger.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Food Items:**\n   - (1,1): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (2,1): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (5,4): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Movements\n\nFrom the current head position (6,6) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U):** (6,7) → y=7 is a border wall → invalid (collision)\n- **Down (D):** (6,5) \n- **Left (L):** (5,6) → This is the body segment right after the head → would collide unless it's the tail and the tail moves away\n   - Tail is at (5,2), so (5,6) is not the tail → collision → invalid\n- **Right (R):** (7,6) → x=7 is a border wall → invalid\n\nSo, from Right, the only valid move is **Down (D)** to (6,5).\n\nBut let's check if there's any immediate danger or opportunity with this move.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nLooking at the food:\n1. (1,1): Not reachable immediately.\n2. (2,1): Not reachable immediately.\n3. (5,4): \n   - Current head is at (6,6).\n   - Moving Down to (6,5), then possible next moves:\n     - From (6,5), directions:\n       - Left (L): (5,5)\n       - Right (R): (7,5) → wall\n       - Up (U): (6,6) → body at (5,6), but (6,6) is where the head was, now body is at (5,6), (4,6), etc., so (6,6) is empty unless the body wraps around, which it doesn't seem to.\n       - Down (D): (6,4)\n   - To reach (5,4) from (6,5):\n     - Next move Left to (5,5), then Down to (5,4).\n     - But need to check if (5,4) is safe to eat:\n       - Current tail is at (5,2), after two moves (assuming we eat at (5,4)), the tail would have moved twice:\n         - Original tail: (5,2)\n         - After move 1: if body moves, tail moves from (5,2) to ?\n           - Snake grows when it eats, so if we eat at (5,4) on the second move, the tail doesn't grow until after the move.\n           - Actually, eating adds a segment at the head, tail moves only if no growth.\n           - Need to clarify: when is the length increased? Immediately after eating, so after moving onto food, length increases, tail doesn't move that turn.\n           - So if we eat at (5,4), the segment added is at the new head position, tail stays until next move.\n           - Then next move, tail moves forward.\n       - So after eating at (5,4), the tail is still at (5,2), next move it moves to where the second last segment was.\n       - So no immediate collision from tail.\n       - But is (5,4) under the snake's body? Current body segments:\n         - (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2)\n         - No, (5,4) is not in the body.\n       - So eating (5,4) is safe.\n\nBut is there a more immediate food to go for?\n\nLooking at (5,4), it's at a distance:\n- From (6,6) to (5,4):\n  - Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n  - Need at least 3 moves to reach it.\n\nOther foods are at (1,1) and (2,1), which are even farther.\n\nSo (5,4) is the closest food, but not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n### Immediate Move Options\n\nFrom (6,6), direction R, possible moves:\n- U: (6,7) → wall → invalid\n- D: (6,5) → valid\n- L: (5,6) → body → invalid\n- R: (7,6) → wall → invalid\n\nOnly Down (D) to (6,5) is valid.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), next possible moves:\n- From (6,5), direction D (since we moved D from R, no instant reverse, so can't go U)\n  - Possible: L, R, D\n    - L: (5,5)\n    - R: (7,5) → wall\n    - D: (6,4)\n\nThen from (5,5) or (6,4), can proceed towards (5,4).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs (6,5) safe?\n- Not a wall.\n- Not a body segment: body is at (5,6), (4,6), etc. (6,5) is not in the list.\n- No food at (6,5) to worry about tail reward danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid immediate move is **Down (D)** to (6,5). This move avoids walls and body collisions, and sets us up to potentially reach the food at (5,4) in subsequent moves.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)].\n   - Current direction: Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1,1): value=1, life_span=1.\n   - (2,1): value=4, life_span=1.\n   - (5,4): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (3,5): value=10, life_span=1.\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,5), moving Down (D). From the current direction, the possible moves are:\n\n- **Continue Down (D)**: (6,4).\n- **Turn Left (L)**: (5,5).\n- **Turn Right (R)**: (7,5).\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of Down (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (6,4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at the bottom, so y=4 is safe (not a wall).\n  - Internal obstacles: None at (6,4).\n  - Body collision: The snake's body segments are at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). (6,4) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n  \n- Food at (6,4)? No food listed there.\n  \n- Is this move safe? Yes, no immediate collisions.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5,5)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left, x=5 is safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: None at (5,5).\n  - Body collision: Check if (5,5) is in body segments. The body is at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), etc. (5,5) is not in the body, so safe.\n  \n- Food at (5,5)? No food listed there.\n  \n- Is this move safe? Yes.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7,5)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall (border), so this is a wall collision.\n  \n- This move is invalid because it hits the wall.\n\nSo, possible valid moves are Down to (6,4) or Left to (5,5). Moving Right is not an option.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go for:\n\n1. **Food at (1,1)**: value=1, life_span=1.\n   - Distance from head (6,5): Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |5-1| = 5 + 4 = 9.\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Not reachable in one move.\n\n2. **Food at (2,1)**: value=4, life_span=1.\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n   - Life span 1, disappears next turn. Not reachable.\n\n3. **Food at (5,4)**: value=7, life_span=1.\n   - Distance: |6-5| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - Can reach in two moves: \n     - First move to (5,5) or (6,4).\n     - Then from (5,5), can move Down to (5,4) or Left to (4,5), etc.\n     - From (6,4), can move Left to (5,4).\n   - But life span is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Not reachable in one move.\n\n4. **Food at (3,5)**: value=10, life_span=1.\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n   - Can reach in three moves, but life span is 1, so disappears next turn. Not reachable.\n\nNone of the food items are reachable in the next move to be eaten immediately. So, the immediate move should focus on positioning the snake for future food collection while avoiding risks.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- Eating it would cause the head and newly grown tail to collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,2). Adjacent cells to tail are:\n- (3,2), (5,2), (4,1), (4,3).\n\nHead is at (6,5), which is not adjacent to (4,2). So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding Between Down and Left\n\nBoth Down to (6,4) and Left to (5,5) are safe. Let's see which is better for future moves:\n\n1. **Move Down to (6,4)**:\n   - Next position: (6,4).\n   - Possible next moves from there: Left to (5,4), Right to (7,4) (wall), Down to (6,3).\n   - (5,4) has food with value=7, but it will disappear after this turn (life_span=1), so next turn it's gone.\n   - (6,3) is safe unless there's a wall or body. Checking:\n     - Walls: y=3 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (1,3) is an obstacle, but (6,3) is clear.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (6,5), (6,6), etc., not at (6,3).\n\n2. **Move Left to (5,5)**:\n   - Next position: (5,5).\n   - Possible next moves: Up to (5,6), Down to (5,4), Left to (4,5), Right to (6,5).\n     - Up to (5,6): body is at (5,6) (next segment after head), so collision.\n     - Down to (5,4): food there (value=7), but will disappear after this turn.\n     - Left to (4,5): body is at (4,5), so collision.\n     - Right to (6,5): body is at (6,5), but that's the current head position, which is now moving to (5,5), so (6,5) is the next segment. Wait, no: after moving to (5,5), the body becomes [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), ...]. So (6,5) is the first body segment. Moving right to (6,5) would collide with body.\n   - So from (5,5), only safe move is Down to (5,4), but food there is disappearing.\n\nBetween the two, moving Down seems better because from (6,4), we have more options next turn (Left to (5,4) or Down to (6,3)), whereas from (5,5), we're more constrained.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Benefit\n\nSince no food is reachable in one move, the immediate goal is to position the snake safely for future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D) to (6,4)**: Safe, and offers better future move options.\n- **Left (L) to (5,5)**: Safe, but limits next moves more.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(2,1): life_span=4, value=1 (positive)\n2. (5,4): life_span=6, value=1 (positive)\n3. (3,5): life_span=9, value=1 (positive)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (6,4)\n  - Body segments follow in order: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n  \n  So, the snake is moving downward from (6,6) to (6,5) to (6,4) (head). Then it turns left to (5,6), then left again to (4,6), then down to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then down to (4,3).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,1): Far to the left and down.\n  - (5,4): Close to the head, at the same y-level as the head but one to the left.\n  - (3,5): Above the middle-left part of the snake's body.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Down (D). The possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), but we cannot reverse direction instantly. Since the current direction is D, the opposite is U, so we cannot move Up next. Thus, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Down (D)**: (6,4) → (6,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so y=3 is safe.\n     - Body segments: The body is at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). (6,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (6,3).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (6,3), no score change.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (6,4) → (5,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so x=5 is safe.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,4) is not listed as an obstacle.\n     - Body segments: Is (5,4) in the body? Current body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). (5,4) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Food at (5,4) with value=1 (positive).\n     - Can we eat it? The food is not under the snake's body (since (5,4) is not in the body), so yes, we can eat it immediately by moving onto it.\n     - Tail Reward Danger: After eating, the snake grows by 1. The new tail will be the current tail's position before moving. Current tail is (4,3). After moving left to (5,4), the body becomes [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)]. The new tail is (4,3). Is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (5,4), tail is at (4,3). They are diagonally adjacent (distance of sqrt(2)), which is not considered adjacent in the usual 4-directional movement (only U/D/L/R). So no adjacency, no danger.\n   - Outcome: Moves to (5,4), eats food, length increases by 1, score +1.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (6,4) → (7,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,4) is a wall → collision.\n   - Outcome: Dies by hitting the wall. Not good.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nFrom the above:\n- Move D: Safe, no score.\n- Move L: Safe, score +1.\n- Move R: Death.\n\nBetween D and L, L is better because it gains a point without any risk (no tail reward danger in this case).\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\nIs there any other food that's better to go for?\n- (2,1): Far away, life_span=4. Not immediately accessible.\n- (3,5): At (3,5), life_span=9. Currently, the snake's body is around that area (e.g., (4,5), (4,6), etc.), but (3,5) is not under the body, so it's accessible if we can reach it safely in future moves. But currently, moving left to (5,4) is the only immediate food.\n\nIs there any risk in moving left to (5,4)?\n- After moving, the snake's body will be longer, but the next moves will have to navigate carefully to avoid trapping itself.\n- However, for the immediate move, it's safe and beneficial.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Moving Left\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), the snake's direction will be L (since we moved left from down, but direction changes to the last moved direction unless specified otherwise; assuming direction updates to the move direction). Then, next possible moves would be U, D, L (can't go R opposite to L).\n\nBut that's for future turns; right now, we're only deciding the immediate move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (5,4) to eat the positive food there, increasing the score by 1 without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(3,5): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n**Snake Body:**\n- Head at (5,4)\n- Next segment at (6,4) → the snake was moving left from (6,4) to (5,4), so the previous direction was right (R), but now it's moving left (L).\n- Continuing: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n\n**Food:**\n- (2,1): positive food, disappears in 3 turns\n- (3,5): positive food, disappears in 8 turns\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse:** Since the current direction is Left (L), we cannot move Right (R) next.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for collisions and food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L): (x-1,y) → (4,4)\n\nCheck if (4,4) is safe:\n- Is (4,4) a wall? \n  - Border walls: no (x=4 is between 0 and 7, y=4 is between 0 and 7)\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4) → no (4,4)\n- Is (4,4) part of the snake's body?\n  - Snake body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n  - (4,4) is the 7th segment (counting from head as 0: head is (5,4), so (4,4) is index 7)\n  - The tail is at (4,3), which will move forward when the head moves, so (4,4) is currently occupied by the body but will be vacated as the tail moves.\n  - However, moving into the cell where the tail is moving from is allowed because the tail moves away, but here (4,4) is not the tail; it's the segment before the tail. The tail is at (4,3), which moves to where (4,4) was, but (4,4) is occupied by the body segment that's not the tail.\n  - Wait, the snake's body is: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n  - So moving left to (4,4) would make the head go to where the 7th segment is, and the tail (4,3) moves to (4,4), but the head is already at (4,4), so that's a collision.\n  - Actually, no: the head moves to (4,4), the segment after head moves to (5,4), and so on, with the tail (4,3) moving to where (4,4) was, but the head is now at (4,4), so the new tail is at (4,4), but the head is also at (4,4) → collision.\n  - Wait, no: the head moves to (4,4), then the next segment moves to (5,4), etc., and the tail (4,3) moves to (4,4), but the head is already at (4,4), so the tail would overlap with the head → collision.\n  - Therefore, moving left to (4,4) causes a collision with the body.\n\nSo, Left (L) is not safe.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U): (x,y+1) → (5,5)\n\nCheck if (5,5) is safe:\n- Walls:\n  - Not a border wall (x=5, y=5 within 0-7)\n  - Not an internal obstacle\n- Snake body:\n  - Body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n  - (5,5) is not in the body\n- Food:\n  - No food at (5,5)\n  \nSo, moving Up is safe, but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D): (x,y-1) → (5,3)\n\nCheck if (5,3) is safe:\n- Walls:\n  - Not a border wall (x=5, y=3 within 0-7)\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,3) is at x=1, not x=5\n- Snake body:\n  - Body segments: check if (5,3) is in the list\n  - (5,3) is not in the body\n- Food:\n  - No food at (5,3)\n  \nSo, moving Down is also safe, but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food safely in the next moves.\n\n**Food at (2,1):**\n- Current head at (5,4)\n- To reach (2,1), need to go left and down\n- Distance: |5-2|=3 left, |4-1|=3 down\n- Need at least 6 moves to reach, but life_span is 3, so it will disappear before we can reach it.\n\n**Food at (3,5):**\n- Current head at (5,4)\n- Distance: |5-3|=2 left, |4-5|=1 up\n- Total distance: 3 moves\n- Life_span is 8, so it will be there for 8 more turns, including current\n- Can reach in 3 moves: e.g., Left, Left, Up\n  - But need to plan immediate move to start this path\n\nCurrent possible moves: Up (safe), Down (safe)\n\nFrom (5,4):\n- Up to (5,5): then next move could be Left to (4,5), then Left to (3,5) to eat food\n  - But need to check if (4,5) is safe after first move\n  - After moving to (5,5), body would be: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), etc.\n  - Then Left to (4,5): check if (4,5) is in body: yes, it's the 6th segment currently at (4,5), but after first move, it would be at (5,4), so (4,5) is not in body\n  - Then Left to (3,5): not in body, not wall\n  - So path: U, L, L to eat (3,5)\n\nAlternative:\n- Down to (5,3): then next moves could be Left to (4,3), but (4,3) is tail, which will move to (4,4), so (4,3) is safe\n  - Then Left to (3,3), then Up to (3,4), then Up to (3,5)\n  - This takes more moves (4 moves), so not optimal\n\nBest path seems to be U, L, L to reach (3,5) in 3 moves.\n\nBut we're only deciding the immediate move at t₀=39.\n\nBetween U and D, U is better because it starts the path towards food at (3,5).\n\nDown is safe but doesn't help in reaching food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there food adjacent to the head that we can eat immediately?\n\nHead at (5,4), adjacent cells:\n- Left (L): (4,4) - body segment, collision as discussed\n- Right (R): (6,4) - opposite direction, cannot move\n- Up (U): (5,5) - no food\n- Down (D): (5,3) - no food\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so best to start moving towards the closest food at (3,5).\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
