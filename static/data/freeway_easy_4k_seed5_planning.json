The span is the position of the car on the x-axis, I think, since the game is on a 2D grid, but the player is always at x=0, and moves only vertically. The cars are on horizontal freeways, so their movement is horizontal, and collision is when x=0 is covered by a car on the same y-level at that turn.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So when I decide to move at turn T, I'm still on the current y at turn T, and I move to the new y at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I check if there's a car on y_T that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThen, after moving, at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1}, and I check cars on that freeway.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since there are no cars on y=0 or y=9, I think, because freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, no freeway there, and y=9 is the target, also no freeway, so only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nNow, I need to minimize H, the number of turns, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nThe cars are moving horizontally with constant speed, and I have their positions at turn t_1=0.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car, head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nSince direction is right, and head=48, tail=37, that means the car is from x=37 to x=48, I think, because for right-moving, span is [tail, head] with head > tail, so at t=0, span [37,48].\n\nThen for turn T, since right-moving, span becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T], since t1=0.\n\nt1=0, so for turn T, position is [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T].\n\nCollision if 0 is in this span, i.e., 37 + 12T ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12T.\n\nBut 37+12T ≤ 0 implies T ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, since T≥0, 37+12T ≥37>0, so 0 is never in [37+12T, 48+12T] for T≥0, because the car starts at x=37 to 48, all positive, and moving right, so it's always to the right of x=0. So on freeway 1, no collision possible, since the car is always x>0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6.\n\nHead and tail: for right-moving, span is [τ, h], but τ is tail, h is head, and since moving right, head should be greater than tail? Here head=-48, tail=-59, so -48 > -59, so span [ -59, -48 ] at t=0.\n\nThen at turn T, right-moving, so [ τ + sT, h + sT ] = [ -59 + 6T, -48 + 6T ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -59 + 6T, -48 + 6T ]\n\nSo -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nFrom first inequality: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 => 6T ≤ 59 => T ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 6T => 6T ≥ 48 => T ≥ 8\n\nSo for T=8,9,10? T≥8 and T≤9.833, so T=8,9 since T integer.\n\nT=8: -59 + 48 = -11? -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\n-48 + 48 = 0, so at T=8, span [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ], so yes, x=0 is the head? Head at -48 + 48 =0.\n\nSimilarly T=9: -59 + 54 = -5, -48 + 54 =6, so [ -5,6], which includes 0.\n\nT=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], no 0.\n\nSo collision at T=8 and T=9 on freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 is y=2, I think. Freeway k=1 is y=1, k=2 is y=2, etc.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-48, -59, right, 6), same as above. So for y=3, same car configuration, so collision at T=8 and T=9 on y=3.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-48, -59, right, 6), so same for y=4.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 6), y=5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSpan at t=0: [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nAt turn T: [ -83 + 36T, -48 + 36T ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -83 + 36T, -48 + 36T ]\n\nSo -83 + 36T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36T\n\nFirst: -83 + 36T ≤ 0 => 36T ≤ 83 => T ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 36T => 36T ≥ 48 => T ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nBut T ≤ 2.305 and T ≥ 1.333, so T=2 since T integer? T=2: -83 + 72 = -11, -48 + 72 = 24, so [ -11, 24], includes 0.\n\nT=1: -83 +36 = -47, -48 +36 = -12, [ -47, -12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=3: -83 + 108 = 25, -48 + 108 = 60, [25,60], no 0.\n\nSo only T=2 for freeway 6, y=6.\n\nT=2: 0 in [ -11, 24], yes.\n\nNow freeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-95, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSpan at t=0: [ -95, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -95 + 48T, -48 + 48T ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -95 + 48T, -48 + 48T ]\n\n-95 + 48T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48T\n\nFirst: -95 + 48T ≤ 0 => 48T ≤ 95 => T ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 48T => 48T ≥ 48 => T ≥ 1\n\nSo T=1 and T=2? T≥1 and T≤1.979, so T=1 and T=2.\n\nT=1: -95 +48 = -47, -48 +48=0, so [ -47, 0], includes 0.\n\nT=2: -95 + 96 =1, -48 +96=48, [1,48], no 0.\n\nAt T=1, [ -47, 0], 0 is included, so collision.\n\nAt T=2, [1,48], no 0.\n\nBut T=1: -48 +48*1=0, so head is at 0, included.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, (-48, -95, right, 48), so y=8, collision at T=1.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when collision happens at x=0:\n\n- y=1: no collision, as car is always x>0\n\n- y=2: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, collision at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: same, T=8,9\n\n- y=5: same, T=8,9\n\n- y=6: collision at T=2\n\n- y=7: collision at T=1\n\n- y=8: collision at T=1\n\ny=7 and y=8 have collision at T=1, meaning at turn 1.\n\nThe player starts at turn 0 at y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, they are safe.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up directly, but I need to avoid the freeways when there is a collision.\n\nLet me denote the turn number starting from t=0.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t.\n\ny_0 = 0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum turns is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, but that would increase H, so probably I can do it in 9 turns if possible, but I need to check for each y when I can be there safely.\n\nSince collision depends on the turn when I am on a freeway.\n\nFor example, to go from y=0 to y=1, I need to be on y=1 at some turn.\n\ny=1 has no collision at any turn, so I can be on y=1 anytime.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2, I can be on y=2 except at turns 8 and 9.\n\nBut since I start at turn 0, and I want to reach quickly, turns 8 and 9 might not be relevant if I pass y=2 earlier.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe critical points are the freeways where collision happens at early turns, like y=6 at T=2, y=7 at T=1, y=8 at T=1.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have collision at T=1, which is very soon.\n\nT=1 is turn 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn: actions U,U,U,... from t=0 to t=8, then at turn 8, y=8, but I need to reach y=9, so at turn 8, y=8, then U to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nBut let's see the positions:\n\nTurn 0: y=0, safe (no car)\n\nAction a_0: say U\n\nTurn 1: y=1, after move. At turn 1, I am on y=1.\n\ny=1 has no collision, so safe.\n\nThen a_1: U\n\nTurn 2: y=2, on y=2 at turn 2.\n\nNow, y=2 has collision only at T=8 and 9, not at T=2, so safe.\n\na_2: U\n\nTurn 3: y=3, on y=3 at turn 3.\n\ny=3 collision at T=8,9, not 3, safe.\n\na_3: U\n\nTurn 4: y=4, safe similarly.\n\na_4: U\n\nTurn 5: y=5, safe.\n\na_5: U\n\nTurn 6: y=6, on y=6 at turn 6.\n\nBut y=6 has collision at T=2 only. Turn 6 ≠2, so no collision, safe.\n\na_6: U\n\nTurn 7: y=7, on y=7 at turn 7.\n\ny=7 has collision at T=1. Turn 7 ≠1, so no collision, safe? T=1 is turn 1, turn 7 is different, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_7: U\n\nTurn 8: y=8, on y=8 at turn 8.\n\ny=8 has collision at T=1. Turn 8 ≠1, so safe? But y=8 collision at T=1 only, as above.\n\nThen a_8: U\n\nTurn 9: y=9, reached.\n\nBut at turn 8, y=8, and action U to go to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, I am on y=8, and since no collision at turn 8 for y=8, safe.\n\nThen turn 9, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, I never hit a collision point.\n\ny=6 at turn 6: collision only at T=2, turn 6 fine.\n\ny=7 at turn 7: collision at T=1, turn 7 fine.\n\ny=8 at turn 8: collision at T=1, turn 8 fine.\n\nAnd y=2 to y=5 at turns 2-5, no collision since collision only at 8,9.\n\nSo actually, with all U, I can reach in 9 turns without collision.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me double-check the collision times.\n\nFor y=2, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt turn 2, I am on y=2, T=2, not 8 or 9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4,5 same.\n\ny=6: collision only at T=2.\n\nAt turn 6, T=6 ≠2, safe.\n\ny=7: collision at T=1.\n\nTurn 7 ≠1, safe.\n\ny=8: collision at T=1.\n\nTurn 8 ≠1, safe.\n\nAnd y=1 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo with 9 up moves, I reach at turn 9.\n\nBut the player position: start turn 0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0=U, at turn 1, y=1.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_8=U at turn 8, to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to t=H-1, so to reach at turn H-1 with y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 9, y=9, so H-1=9, H=10? Let's see the definition.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nt1=0, so {a_t for t=0 to H-1} and y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, with all U:\n\nt=0: action U, then at t=1, y=1\n\nt=1: action U, at t=2, y=2\n\n...\n\nt=8: action U, at t=9, y=9\n\nSo at t=9, y=9, which is turn index H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nBut the number of actions is 9, from t=0 to t=8.\n\nH is the number of turns, which includes the starting point or not?\n\nLet's read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, at t1=0, if H=1, then y_{0 +1 -1} = y_0, which should be 9, but y0=0, not 9.\n\nIf H=1, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{0+1-1} = y0 =0 ≠9.\n\nTo reach at turn T, y_T=9, then H-1 = T, so T = H-1.\n\nIn this case, to reach at turn 9, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=0 to t=H-1, which is t=0 to 9 for H=10? No.\n\n{ a_t for t=0 to H-1 }, and after these actions, at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt1=0, so at turn H-1, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\nFor example, with H=10, actions t=0 to t=9, but at turn H-1=9, y=9.\n\nBut with actions: if I do actions from t=0 to t=8, that's 9 actions, to reach at t=9.\n\nSo for H=10, actions from t=0 to t=9, but I only need to go up to t=8 to reach at t=9.\n\nIf I do action at t=9, but I'm already at y=9, I might do S or something, but to minimize H, I should not do extra actions.\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions: t=0 to t=8 all U, I reach at t=9.\n\nSo y_9=9, which is turn H-1=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut the actions are for t=0 to H-2? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions, leading to y at turn H.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is given, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe state is at the beginning of turn t.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the turn when I am at position.\n\nAt turn t, player is at (0, y_t).\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which causes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t for the position (0, y_t), with the cars on freeway y_t.\n\nIf y_t between 1 and 8, and at that turn, for that freeway, 0 is in the car span.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nWith all U actions:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe. Action a_0=U, so y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, safe (no collision for y=1). Action a_1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, on freeway 2. Collision? At turn 2, for y=2, car span [ -59 +6*2, -48 +6*2] = [ -59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], all negative, 0 not in, so safe. Action U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, similarly, span for y=3 same as y=2, [ -47,-36]? For y=3, car is same, so [ -59 +6*3, -48 +6*3] = [ -59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30], still negative, no 0. Safe. Action U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, [ -59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], negative, safe. U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y=5, [ -59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18], negative, safe. U, y6=6\n\nt=6: y=6, on freeway 6. Car: at turn 6, span [ -83 +36*6, -48 +36*6] = [ -83 + 216, -48 + 216] = [133, 168], all positive, 0 not in, safe. Action U, y7=7\n\nt=7: y=7, on freeway 7. Car at turn 7: [ -95 +48*7, -48 +48*7] = [ -95 + 336, -48 + 336] = [241, 288], positive, no 0. Safe. Action U, y8=8\n\nt=8: y=8, on freeway 8. Car at turn 8: [ -95 +48*8, -48 +48*8] = [ -95 + 384, -48 + 384] = [289, 336], positive, no 0. Safe. Action U, y9=9\n\nt=9: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nSo yes, with actions from t=0 to t=8: all U, I reach at t=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 9 actions, from t=0 to t=8.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H=10, since from t=0 to t=9, but at t=9 I don't need to do action if I'm already there, but in the sequence, I need to specify actions until I reach.\n\nIn the sequence {a_t for t=0 to H-1}, and at turn H-1, y=9.\n\nHere, at turn 9, y=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, but at t=9, I don't need to move, I can do S, but to minimize H, H=10 is fine, with a_9=S or something, but since I reach at t=9, I can have a_9=S, but it's unnecessary.\n\nSince at t=8, after action U, at t=9 y=9, so I don't need action at t=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=10, it includes a_9, which can be S.\n\nBut to have minimal H, perhaps I can consider H=9.\n\nIf H=9, then y_{9-1}=y_8=9? But with actions from t=0 to t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y_8 should be 9.\n\nBut from start, to have y_8=9, I need to go up 8 times in 8 actions? From t=0 to t=7 actions determine y at t=1 to t=8.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position before action.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter a_0, y1 = y0 + delta a_0\n\nAt t=1, y1, then after a_1, y2 = y1 + delta, and so on.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nWith all U, at t=0, y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1, y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\n...\n\nt=7, y=7, a7=U, y8=8\n\nt=8, y=8, a8=U, y9=9\n\nSo at t=9, y=9.\n\nIf I want y8=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 8.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=0 in 8 moves, I need to go up 9 times? No.\n\nFrom y0=0 to y8=9, that requires 9 up moves in 8 actions? Impossible.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so from turn 0 to turn 8, after 8 actions, y8 <= y0 +8 =8, since max +1 per action.\n\ny0=0, after first action, y1 <=1, after second, y2<=2, ..., after k actions, y_k <= k.\n\nSo at turn 8, after 8 actions, y8 <=8.\n\nSimilarly, min y8 >=0, but to be 9, impossible. y8 <=8.\n\nSo earliest I can reach y=9 is at turn 9, with y9=9.\n\nThus minimal H is 10, with y_{9}=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, but at t=9, I am at y=9, so action a9 can be S or whatever, but I need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to t=8: U, and for t=9, since y=9, I can do S, or not move.\n\nBut to have exactly H actions.\n\nIn this case, with all U from t=0 to t=8, and at t=9 I don't need to act, but for the sequence, I think I need to include up to H-1.\n\nFor H=10, actions t=0 to t=9.\n\na0 to a8: U, a9: S, for example.\n\nBut since I reach at t=9, and action at t=9 is not necessary, but to have the sequence, I can put S.\n\nBut in terms of minimal turns, H=10 is minimal because I can't reach earlier than turn 9.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, with all U, it works, no collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=7 has collision at T=1, but at turn 7, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 7 at turn 7.\n\ny=7, car: head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48, right-moving.\n\nAt turn T=7, span: [ τ + sT, h + sT ] = [ -95 + 48*7, -48 + 48*7 ] = [ -95 + 336, -48 + 336 ] = [241, 288], since 336-95=241, 336-48=288, yes, all positive, no 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=8: [ -95 + 48*8, -48 + 48*8] = [ -95+384, -48+384] = [289, 336], positive.\n\ny=6 at T=6: [ -83 + 36*6, -48 + 36*6] = [ -83 + 216, -48 + 216] = [133, 168], positive.\n\nAnd y=2 at T=2: [ -59 +12, -48 +12] = [-47,-36], negative, no 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster? No, because to go from 0 to 9, need at least 9 moves up, so 9 actions, reaching at turn 9.\n\nWith H=10 turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to output actions.\n\nIn this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and in this case it does.\n\nBut let me check if for some freeway, at some turn, but in the path, I don't hit the collision times.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't, since max speed up.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at 0.\n\nMaybe I can go down to avoid, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 6, it says (-48,-83,right,36), but at T=2, it should cover 0, but at T=6, it's far away.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the sequence, I am on y=7 at turn 7, which is not T=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nFreeway 7: cars (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nAt T=1: span [ -95 +48*1, -48 +48*1] = [ -47, 0 ], which includes 0, so at turn 1, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 1, y=8 also collision if on it.\n\nBut in my path, I am on y=7 at turn 7, not turn 1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6, collision only at T=2, but I am at T=6.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with actions all U from t=0 to t=8, and at t=9, since I'm at y=9, I can do S, but actually, for the sequence up to H-1=9, I need to specify a9.\n\nIn the sequence for t=0 to H-1, with H=10, t=0 to 9.\n\na0 to a8: U, then a9: since y=9, I can do S, or even U, but y=9, if U, it stays 9, since y<=9.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to output actions starting from turn t1=0.\n\nSo for H=10, actions from turn 0 to turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, action is not necessary, but I have to include it.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=9, but impossible as y8<=8.\n\nUnless I start moving, but no.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nSequence: turn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S  (since at y=9)\n\nAfter a8=U at turn 8, at turn 9 y=9, so for turn 9, I can choose S to stay.\n\nIf I do nothing, but I have to specify action.\n\nIn the sequence, a9 can be S.\n\nBut to save, but since H=10, I need 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 8, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 6, it says (-48,-83,right,36), but let me confirm the collision time.\n\nEarlier I computed for y=6, collision at T=2 only.\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 +36T, -48 +36T]\n\nSet -83 +36T <=0 <= -48 +36T\n\nLeft: -83 +36T <=0 => T <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so T<=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +36T => 36T >=48 => T>= 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so T>=2 since T integer.\n\nT>=2 and T<=2.305, so T=2.\n\nYes.\n\nAt T=2, [ -83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], includes 0.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn my path, at turn 6, y=6, T=6, not 2, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for turns 0 to 8, and S at turn 9.\n\nBut in the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have only 9 actions, but with H=9, impossible.\n\nThe definition: sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1, and after that, at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nWith t1=0, at turn H-1, y=9.\n\nIf H=9, then at turn 8, y=9, but as above, impossible.\n\nSo H=10, at turn 9, y=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nNow, for t=0 to 8: U, t=9: S.\n\nTo be consistent, I can do U at t=9, but y stays 9.\n\nS is fine.\n\nIn the answer, I should output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 9, since I'm at y=9, I can do S to indicate no move.\n\nNow, but in the problem, there is freeway 3,4,5 with cars, but same as 2.\n\nBut all fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I can reach earlier by skipping some levels, but I can't, since I move one per turn.\n\nUnless I stay, but that delays.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10, with the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe note about moving: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\"\n\nBut in this case, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I check cars on y_T.\n\nAfter move, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go from y to y+1, at turn T I am on y, then after U, at T+1 on y+1.\n\nNo issue.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, I am on y=6, safe, then move to y=7 at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 7, on y=7, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence is:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut H=10.\n\nBut let me confirm the car for freeway 1, but it's fine.\n\nFreeway 8: at turn 1, collision, but I am not on it at turn 1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the car on that freeway has position \\(x = 0\\) within its span at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Car (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12). The span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\\). Since \\(37 + 12T > 0\\) for all \\(T \\geq 0\\), 0 is never in the span. Thus, no collision occurs on y=1 at any turn.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Car (head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6). Span at \\(T\\) is \\([-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\\). Collision occurs when \\(0 \\in [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\\), which is true for \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Same car configuration as y=2. Collision occurs at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Same car configuration as y=2. Collision occurs at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Same car configuration as y=2. Collision occurs at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Car (head=-48, tail=-83, direction=right, speed=36). Span at \\(T\\) is \\([-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T]\\). Collision occurs when \\(0 \\in [-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T]\\), which is true only for \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Car (head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48). Span at \\(T\\) is \\([-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\\). Collision occurs when \\(0 \\in [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\\), which is true for \\(T = 1\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Same car configuration as y=7. Collision occurs at \\(T = 1\\).\n\n### Minimal Path to Reach (0, 9)\nThe player must move from y=0 to y=9, requiring at least 9 upward moves. The earliest possible turn to reach y=9 is turn 9, as each move changes y by at most 1 per turn:\n- At turn 0, y=0.\n- After 9 upward moves, y=9 at turn 9.\n\nThe sequence of all \"U\" (up) actions from turn 0 to turn 8 results in y=9 at turn 9:\n- Turn 0: U → y=1 at turn 1\n- Turn 1: U → y=2 at turn 2\n- Turn 2: U → y=3 at turn 3\n- Turn 3: U → y=4 at turn 4\n- Turn 4: U → y=5 at turn 5\n- Turn 5: U → y=6 at turn 6\n- Turn 6: U → y=7 at turn 7\n- Turn 7: U → y=8 at turn 8\n- Turn 8: U → y=9 at turn 9\n\nCollision checks:\n- Turn 0: y=0 (safe, no cars).\n- Turn 1: y=1 (safe, no collision on y=1).\n- Turn 2: y=2 (span at T=2: \\([-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36]\\), no 0; safe).\n- Turn 3: y=3 (span at T=3: \\([-59+18, -48+18] = [-41, -30]\\), no 0; safe).\n- Turn 4: y=4 (span at T=4: \\([-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24]\\), no 0; safe).\n- Turn 5: y=5 (span at T=5: \\([-59+30, -48+30] = [-29, -18]\\), no 0; safe).\n- Turn 6: y=6 (span at T=6: \\([-83+216, -48+216] = [133, 168]\\), no 0; safe, as collision only at T=2).\n- Turn 7: y=7 (span at T=7: \\([-95+336, -48+336] = [241, 288]\\), no 0; safe, as collision only at T=1).\n- Turn 8: y=8 (span at T=8: \\([-95+384, -48+384] = [289, 336]\\), no 0; safe, as collision only at T=1).\n- Turn 9: y=9 (safe, no cars).\n\nNo collisions occur, and y=9 is reached at turn 9. Thus, \\(H-1 = 9\\), so \\(H = 10\\). The sequence includes actions from turn 0 to turn 9 (10 actions). At turn 9, y=9, so action \"S\" (stay) is used to maintain position.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe minimal number of turns is \\(H = 10\\), with the sequence of actions:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) at turn 3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=3. The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn and how they move. The cars move with constant speed, either left or right. Since the collision depends on whether the player is on a freeway at a given turn and if the car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe player update is straightforward: each action changes y by +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car movement: for a car, at turn T, the span is based on the head and tail at t1, with direction and speed.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t1 = 3.\n\nFor each car, I need to find when its span includes x=0 for its freeway.\n\nBut the player is only on one freeway at a time, and only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and for that car on that freeway, if 0 is in the span at T, then collision.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are not on the new freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe key point: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, since the car positions are moving, Span(T) and Span(T+1) are different.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it only depends on the car on the freeway y_T at that turn, and if 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) is the span of the car at turn T, which is fixed for each T based on the initial state at t1.\n\nLet me list all the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: car at (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nSince direction is right, and head and tail: in the table it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: head = -36, tail = -47, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince direction is right, at t1, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But head is -36, tail is -47, so if right-moving, span should be from left to right, so tail should be left end, head right end.\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and \" [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] \" so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h is left, τ is right? It says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, at t1, h is the head, which should be left if moving left? I need to be careful.\n\nLet's read:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince direction right, and span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 12(T-3), -36 + 12(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision for freeway k at turn T if player is on y = k at turn T and 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSince there's only one car per freeway, I think, from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each freeway has one car listed, so I assume one car per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, etc.\n\nNow, for the player to be safe at turn T, when on freeway y_T, 0 should not be in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, I assume, since freeways are from 1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nThe player can be at y=0 or y=9, and since no freeway, no collision possible.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so once there, it's safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 at turn 3 to y=9 as fast as possible, with minimal turns.\n\nEach turn, I can change y by -1, 0, or +1.\n\nSince I need to go up to 9 from 3, I need at least 6 moves up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, but going down might take more turns, so probably not efficient, since I need to minimize H, the number of turns including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H turns, starting from turn t1.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at position, and I take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}, and so on, until after H-1 actions, at turn t1 + H - 1, I reach y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t when I am at (0, y_t), for the car on freeway y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and if 0 in span at turn t.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1 + H - 1, and after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, but the position after H actions is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nI need to reach y = 9 at some turn, say turn T, so at turn T, I am at (0,9).\n\nIn the task, it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\", let's read.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nFrom the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H - 1: a_{t1 + H - 1}\", and after that, at turn t1 + H, I am at y_{t1 + H}, but I need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nLet's see the indices.\n\nAt turn t1, I start at position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,3)\n\nI take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1 + 1}\n\nThen at turn t1 + 1, I am at (0, y_{t1 + 1}), take action a_{t1 + 1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, I am at y_{t1 + k}\n\nI need that at some turn T, y_T = 9, and T = t1 + H - 1 for some H.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t = t1 to t = t1 + H - 1, so H actions, and after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, but I need to be at 9 at turn t1 + H - 1, which is before the last action? No.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, I move to y_{t+1}, so at the start of turn t, I am at y_t, then I take action a_t to go to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t, when I am at y_t, collision is checked based on y_t.\n\nThen I take a_t to go to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at turn T, that means at the start of turn T, I am at (0,9), and no action needed if I stay, but I need to be there at turn T, and since it's the end, I don't need to take action after that.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1 + H - 1, I am at (0,9), so I don't take action at that turn if I have arrived.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, each action for that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, I take a_{t1} to go to y_{t1+1}, then at turn t1+1, I take a_{t1+1} to go to y_{t1+2}, ..., at turn t1+H-2, I take a_{t1+H-2} to go to y_{t1+H-1}, and at turn t1+H-1, I take a_{t1+H-1} to go to y_{t1+H}, but I need to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nContradiction.\n\nLet's define clearly.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nAt the start of turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t)\n\nThen the player chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at the start of turn t+1, the player is at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision is checked at the start of each turn t, for position (0, y_t), if y_t between 1 and 8, and if the car on freeway y_t has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nThe game ends when at the start of some turn, y_t = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions to reach that state.\n\nIn this task, I start at turn t1=3, y3=3.\n\nI need to find actions a3, a4, ..., up to some a_{T-1} such that at turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nAnd T should be minimized.\n\nIn terms of H, the number of turns from start to end, including the start or not?\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo, for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1}\n\nt=1, a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H - 1, after action, but the position at turn t1 + H - 1 is before action a_{t1 + H -1} is taken? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nEach action a_t determines the next position.\n\nAfter taking action a_t at turn t, the position for turn t+1 is set.\n\nAt the start of turn t, we have position y_t, then we take action a_t, then for collision at turn t, it is based on y_t at the start.\n\nThen after a_t, y_{t+1} is set for turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, we take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which determines y_{t1 + H}, but we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1, which means at the start of turn t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nThen at that turn, we take some action, but since we are already at 9, we can stay or move, but to end, we can take any action, but the position is already 9 at that turn.\n\nIn the action sequence, we include the action for turn t1 + H -1, which might move us away, but we need to be at 9 at that turn, so we should take action S or U or D, but if we take U or D, we might move away from 9, so to stay at 9, we should take S at that turn or after reaching.\n\nBut the requirement is to reach at turn t1 + H -1, so at that turn, y=9, and we take an action, but since we are at 9, taking U would go to 10, but y must be in 0-9, so probably not allowed, or it might be invalid.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9, so from 9, U is invalid, similarly from 0, D is invalid.\n\nSo from y=9, only D or S are possible, S keeps at 9, D goes to 8.\n\nSimilarly from 0, only U or S.\n\nBut to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1, we need y_{t1 + H -1} = 9 at the start of the turn.\n\nThen we can take action, say S to stay, or D to go down, but if we go down, we are not at 9 anymore.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at that turn, so we can take action after that, but for the sequence, we include the action for that turn.\n\nPerhaps it's fine to take S at that turn to stay.\n\nOr, if we reach at turn t1 + H -1, we can take S to indicate we are done.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, the last action might be to move to 9 or to stay at 9.\n\nBut to minimize H, we probably reach at that turn and stop.\n\nI think for simplicity, we can assume that at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we take action S or something, but the position is what matters for reaching.\n\nThe action sequence includes the actions to get there.\n\nLet's look at the indices.\n\nSuppose at turn T, we are at y_T = 9.\n\nThen the actions taken are a_t for t from t1 to T-1, because a_t determines y_{t+1}, so to have y_T = 9, we need actions from t1 to T-1.\n\nThen the number of actions is from t1 to T-1, so H = T - t1.\n\nThen in the sequence, actions from t=t1 to t=T-1, which is H actions.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H.\n\nThen at turn T = t1 + H, y_T = 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nFor t=0, a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}\n\nFor t=1, a_{t1+1}, determines y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}, determines y_{t1 + H}\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1, which is the position at the start of turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, then we take action a_{t1 + H -1} to go to y_{t1 + H}\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + H -1} = 9, it means at the start of turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9, before taking any action.\n\nThen we take action a_{t1 + H -1} which may keep us at 9 or move away.\n\nBut for the goal, we just need to be at 9 at that turn, so y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nThe action a_{t1 + H -1} is part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect the reaching, since we are already there.\n\nIn this case, for the sequence, we include a_{t1 + H -1} which is the action taken at turn t1 + H -1 after reaching.\n\nBut to be at 9 at that turn, we could have arrived at an earlier turn, but we need to be there at exactly turn t1 + H -1 for that H.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we can choose to arrive at that turn.\n\nIn practice, for the shortest path, we will arrive at turn T, and T = t1 + H -1, so H = T - t1 +1.\n\nLet's set T as the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nT >= t1, since at t1 we are at 3.\n\nThen the number of turns from start to end is T - t1 +1, but in terms of actions, we take actions from turn t1 to turn T-1 to determine y_{t1+1} to y_T.\n\nThen number of actions is (T - t1).\n\nThen at turn T, we are at y_T = 9, no action taken at turn T.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include actions up to turn T-1.\n\nThen for the problem, H should be the number of actions, and we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\" with H actions.\n\nI think there's a mismatch.\n\nPerhaps it's better to follow the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo for example, with H=1, sequence {a_{t1}} for t=0, so one action, and reach at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, so at turn t1, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut at turn t1, we start at (0,3), so to be at (0,9) at turn t1, we need to be there at start, which we are not, so impossible for H=1.\n\nFor H=2, reach at turn t1 +2-1 = t1+1, so at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nWith one action a_{t1} that takes us from y_t1 to y_t1+1 =9.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9 in one action? But actions only change by -1,0,1, so impossible. Min change per action is 1, so from 3 to 9, at least 6 actions, so min T is t1+6, at turn t1+6, y=9.\n\nThen with actions from t1 to t1+5, 6 actions, H=6, reach at turn t1+6.\n\nBut for the problem, with H actions, reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for H=6, reach at turn t1 +5.\n\nBut at turn t1+5, y=9, but with 6 actions, we can reach at turn t1+6.\n\nI think I need to accept the problem's definition.\n\nLet me define the reach turn.\n\nLet the turn when we are at (0,9) be T.\n\nThen T = t1 + K for some K.\n\nThe actions taken are from turn t1 to T-1, number of actions: T - t1.\n\nThen at turn T, we are at y_T=9.\n\nFor the problem, it wants us to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1, with H actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen the action a_{t1 + H -1} is taken at that turn to go to y_{t1 + H}, which could be 9 or 8 or 10, but since at the start we are at 9, and we take action.\n\nBut for the reaching, it's fine.\n\nTo minimize H, we need the smallest H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSince at turn t1 we are at 3, and each action can increase y by at most 1, the earliest we can be at 9 is turn t1+6, with 6 up actions.\n\nSo min possible T is t1+6, so at turn t1+6, y=9.\n\nThen for that, we need to be at 9 at turn t1+6.\n\nFor the problem, reach at turn t1 + H -1 = t1+6, so H-1 =6, H=7.\n\nThen with H=7 actions, from turn t1 to t1+6, we reach at turn t1+6.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1+6, 7 actions, and at turn t1+6, we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach at turn t1+6, with actions from t1 to t1+5, 6 actions, then at turn t1+6, we are at 9, and we take no action, but in the sequence, we include actions up to the turn before or including.\n\nI think it's easier to go with the problem's definition.\n\nFor this case, min H such that we can be at 9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nMin turn to be at 9 is t1+6, so t1 + H -1 = t1+6, thus H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen with 7 actions, we reach at turn t1+6.\n\nActions from turn t1 to t1+6.\n\nBut at turn t1+6, we take action a_{t1+6}, which determines y_{t1+7}, but we are at y=9 at the start, so we can take S to stay.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence, we include it.\n\nBut in terms of collision, at turn t1+6, we are at y=9, which is safe, no car, so no issue.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nI need to find a path from y=3 at turn 3 to y=9 at some turn, but with min H, so min time to reach.\n\nSince we can wait, but to min time, we should go up as fast as possible, unless blocked by cars.\n\nSo I need to check for each freeway and each turn if it is safe to be there.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions over time.\n\nt1=3.\n\nFor each freeway k, car span at turn T.\n\nLet delta_t = T - t1 = T - 3.\n\nFor freeway 1: car at t1: head h= -36, tail τ= -47, dir right, speed 12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + 12*(T-3), h + 12*(T-3)] = [-47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12(T-3) <= 0 <= -36 +12(T-3)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car (head -30, tail -41, right, speed 6)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + 6*(T-3), h + 6*(T-3)] = [-41 + 6*(T-3), -30 + 6*(T-3)]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6(T-3) <= 0 <= -30 +6(T-3)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head -30, tail -41, right, speed 6, identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, head -30, tail -41, right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 5: same, head -30, tail -41, right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 6: head 60, tail 25, right, speed 36\n\nSpan at T: [τ + 36*(T-3), h + 36*(T-3)] = [25 + 36*(T-3), 60 + 36*(T-3)]\n\n0 in span if 25 +36(T-3) <= 0 <= 60 +36(T-3)\n\nBut 25 +36(T-3) is at least 25 -108 = -83 for T=3, and increases, so for T=3, 25-0=25>0, 60-0=60>0, so 0 not in span, and as T increases, it increases, so 0 is always less than left end, so never in span for freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: head 96, tail 49, right, speed 48\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 48*(T-3), 96 + 48*(T-3)]\n\nAt T=3, [49,96], both >0, and increases, so 0 never in span.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, head 96, tail 49, right, speed 48, same as above, 0 never in span.\n\nSo only freeways 1 to 5 have possible collisions, and 6,7,8 are always safe.\n\nFreeways 1 to 5 have cars that can cover 0 at some time.\n\nNow, for freeway 2,3,4,5: all have the same car: head -30, tail -41, right, speed 6.\n\nSo for each, the span and collision time is the same.\n\nBut since different freeways, I need to consider separately.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and each T, if it is occupied, i.e., if 0 in car span at turn T.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: span at T: [ -47 +12(T-3), -36 +12(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12(T-3) <= 0 <= -36 +12(T-3)\n\nLeft: -47 +12(T-3) <= 0 => 12(T-3) <= 47 => T-3 <= 47/12 = 3.916, so T-3 <= 3 since T integer, T <= 6\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +12(T-3) => 36 <= 12(T-3) => 3 <= T-3 => T >= 6\n\nSo T >=6 and T <=6, so only at T=6, 0 in span for freeway 1.\n\nT-3 <=3 from left, T<=6\n\nT-3 >=3 from right, T>=6, so T=6.\n\nAt turn T=6, for freeway 1, 0 is in span.\n\nNow for freeway 2: same for 3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 2: span [ -41 +6(T-3), -30 +6(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6(T-3) <= 0 <= -30 +6(T-3)\n\nLeft: -41 +6(T-3) <=0 => 6(T-3) <=41 => T-3 <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so T-3 <=6, T<=9\n\nRight: 0 <= -30 +6(T-3) => 30 <=6(T-3) => 5 <= T-3 => T >=8\n\nSo T >=8 and T <=9\n\nThus for freeway 2, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 3,4,5, same thing, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied only at T=6.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 3, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize time, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, if at turn T, we are on freeway k, and k is occupied at T, collision.\n\nNow, since we start at y=3, and y=3 is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 3, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nIs freeway 3 occupied at T=3?\n\nFor freeway 3, occupied at T=8 and 9, not at T=3, since T=3, T-3=0, span [-41, -30], both negative, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, at T=3, all freeways are safe, since for 1, at T=3, span [-47,-36], both neg; for 2,3,4,5: [-41,-30] all neg; for 6,7,8: safe.\n\nSo at turn 3, y=3 is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, min turn is turn 9? Turn t1+6=3+6=9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 9, for freeway 9? y=9 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nBut during the path, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves up, but we can only move one per turn, so 6 turns, from turn 3 to turn 9.\n\nActions: at each turn, move up.\n\nBut we need to check if at any turn, when we are on a freeway, it is occupied.\n\nThe path: start turn 3, y=3.\n\nAction U: to y=4 at turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, y=4.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, y=5.\n\nAction U: to y=6 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, y=6.\n\nBut freeway 6 is always safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nAction U: to y=7 at turn 7.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\nAction U: to y=8 at turn 8.\n\nNow at turn 8, y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 is always safe, as per earlier.\n\nAction U: to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn, when on freeway, if occupied.\n\nTurn 3: y=3, freeway 3, occupied only at T=8,9, not at 3, safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=4, freeway 4, occupied at T=8,9, not at 4, safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=5, freeway 5, occupied at T=8,9, not at 5, safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and we reach at turn 9 with 6 up actions from turn 3 to turn 8.\n\nActions: at turn 3: U, to y4 at turn4\n\nTurn4: U, to y5 at turn5\n\nTurn5: U, to y6 at turn6\n\nTurn6: U, to y7 at turn7\n\nTurn7: U, to y8 at turn8\n\nTurn8: U, to y9 at turn9\n\nAt turn9, we are at y9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, with H=7, we reach at turn t1 + H -1 =3+7-1=9.\n\nActions: from turn t1 to t1+H-1, i.e., turn3 to turn9? H=7 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 6, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 6, so a3 to a8.\n\nAt turn3: a3\n\nTurn4: a4\n\n...\n\nTurn8: a8\n\nThen after a8, at turn9, y9.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1 =3+7-1=9, which is turn9, so y9=9.\n\nIn this case, with actions a3 to a8, all U, we have y4=4, y5=5, ..., y9=9.\n\nAt turn9, y9=9, which is the reaching turn.\n\nNow, we also need to check if at any point we were on a freeway when occupied.\n\nIn this path:\n\nAt turn3: y=3, freeway3, not occupied (only at 8,9)\n\nTurn4: y=4, freeway4, not occupied\n\nTurn5: y=5, freeway5, not occupied\n\nTurn6: y=6, freeway6, safe\n\nTurn7: y=7, freeway7, safe\n\nTurn8: y=8, freeway8, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at turn8, y=8, which is freeway8, but freeway8 is safe, no car issue.\n\nAnd we reach y9 at turn9.\n\nIs there a problem at turn6?\n\nFreeway1 is occupied at turn6, but we are on y=6 at turn6, not on freeway1, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn8, freeways 2,3,4,5 are occupied, but we are on y=8, not on them.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can go directly up in 6 moves, reaching at turn9.\n\nH=7, since 7 actions to reach at turn9.\n\nMinimal H should be 7.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nEarliest possible is turn9, since from turn3 to turn9 is 6 turns later, turn9.\n\nTurn t1=3, at turn3 y=3, after one action at turn3, to y4 at turn4; after two actions, to y5 at turn5; ... after six actions, to y9 at turn9.\n\nSo min turn to reach is turn9.\n\nWe can't reach earlier.\n\nIn this case, with the car positions, it seems we can.\n\nBut let's confirm the freeway at turn6.\n\nFreeway1 occupied at turn6, but we are on y=6, which is freeway6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nBut what if we need to be on freeway1 at some point? We don't, since we go from 3 to 4 to 5 to 6, etc., skipping freeway1.\n\nFreeway1 is y=1, we are at y=3,4,5,6,7,8, not y=1.\n\nSo no need.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2-5 occupied at 8 and 9, but at turn8 we are at y=8, safe, and at turn9 y=9, safe.\n\nSo the path works.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 6 actions, but with H=7, actions from turn3 to turn8.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1=3 to t1+H-1=3+7-1=9? t1+H-1=9, actions from turn3 to turn9? No.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nH=7, t from 0 to 6, so a_{3+0} to a_{3+6}, i.e., a3 to a8.\n\nAt turn3: a3=U\n\nTurn4: a4=U\n\nTurn5: a5=U\n\nTurn6: a6=U\n\nTurn7: a7=U\n\nTurn8: a8=U\n\nThen at turn9, y=9.\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) at turn9, which is t1 + H -1 =3+7-1=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence for the actions.\n\nIn this case, no issue with cars.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway3 at turn3? No, as we checked.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway3 at turn3.\n\nFreeway3: car at T=3, span [-41 +6(0), -30 +6(0)] = [-41,-30], both <0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAnd at turn8, freeway3 occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and in this case, no collisions.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, if I move from y to y+1, at turn T, I am on y, then I move to y+1 for next turn.\n\nIn the collision check, only when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nIn this path, all safe.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier? No, impossible.\n\nH=7 is minimal.\n\nBut H=7 actions to reach at turn9.\n\nPerhaps with waiting, but that would increase H, so not better.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the car on freeway6: earlier I said freeway6 is always safe, but let's confirm.\n\nFreeway6: car head 60, tail 25, right, speed 36.\n\nAt T, span [25 +36(T-3), 60 +36(T-3)]\n\nFor T=3, [25,60], min 25>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nAs T increases, left increases, so always >0, never 0 in span. Safe.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway7: [49 +48(T-3), 96 +48(T-3)], at T=3, [49,96]>0, increases, safe.\n\nFreeway8 same.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is straightforward.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nBut the sequence has 6 actions? From turn3 to turn8, 6 actions.\n\nH=7, but 6 actions?\n\nt from 0 to 6? t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6? That's 7 values.\n\nt=0: turn3, t=1: turn4, ..., t=6: turn9? No.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=7, t=0 to 6.\n\nt=0: a_{3+0} = a3\n\nt=1: a_{3+1} = a4\n\nt=2: a5\n\nt=3: a6\n\nt=4: a7\n\nt=5: a8\n\nt=6: a9? But a9 is for turn9.\n\nt=6: a_{3+6} = a9\n\nBut we reach at turn t1 + H -1 = 3+7-1=9, so at turn9, we are at (0,9).\n\nAt turn9, we take action a9, which determines y10, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a9 as well.\n\nBut in my earlier plan, I only have actions up to turn8 to reach at turn9.\n\nWith actions from turn3 to turn8 (6 actions), we set y4 to y9.\n\nThen at turn9, we are at y9=9.\n\nBut for the sequence, with H=7, we need 7 actions, including a9.\n\nAt turn9, we are at y9=9, and we can take action S, for example, to stay.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we include a9=S or something.\n\nBut to minimize H, we can have H smaller if we reach earlier, but we can't reach earlier than turn9.\n\nWith H=6, reach at turn t1 +6 -1 =3+6-1=8.\n\nCan we be at y=9 at turn8?\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn8, we need to have moved up 6 times from turn3 to turn8? From turn3 to turn8.\n\nAt turn3: start y3=3\n\nAfter action a3, y4 = y3 + delta\n\n...\n\nAfter action a7, y8 = ? \n\nTo have y8=9.\n\ny8 is set by action a7 at turn7.\n\ny8 = y7 + delta a7\n\nSimilarly, y7 = y6 + delta a6, and so on.\n\nStarting from y3=3.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{3+k} = 3 + sum of delta from t=3 to 3+k-1.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for T=8.\n\ny8 = 3 + sum_{t=3}^{7} delta a_t\n\nEach delta <=1, so min sum is when all U, sum=5 for t=3 to7, 5 actions? Actions from t=3 to t=7, 5 actions, to set y4 to y8.\n\ny4 = y3 + delta a3\n\ny5 = y4 + delta a4 = y3 + delta a3 + delta a4\n\n...\n\ny8 = y3 + sum_{i=3}^{7} delta a_i\n\nTo have y8=9, since y3=3, we need sum_{i=3}^{7} delta a_i =6\n\nBut there are 5 actions: a3 to a7, each delta <=1, so max sum=5, which gives y8=3+5=8, not 9.\n\nCannot reach y8=9 with actions up to a7.\n\nTo reach at turn8, y8=9, we need y8=9, which requires the sum from actions before.\n\nFrom turn3 to turn8, we have actions at turn3,4,5,6,7 to determine y4,y5,y6,y7,y8.\n\ny8 is determined by a7 at turn7.\n\nWith 5 actions, max y8=3+5=8.\n\nCannot be 9 at turn8.\n\nSimilarly, earliest at turn9, y9=9, with 6 actions from turn3 to turn8.\n\nThen for H, to reach at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nSo 3 + H -1 =9, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nAnd actions from turn3 to turn9? a3 to a9, but a9 is for turn9, which we take after reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=7, actions a3 to a9.\n\nBut at turn9, we are already at y9=9, and we take action a9, which can be S to stay.\n\nThen y10=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn terms of the path, we can have a9=S.\n\nSimilarly, in my earlier, with a3 to a8 all U, we reach at turn9.\n\nThen for the sequence, we need to include a9 as well for H=7.\n\nBut a9 is not necessary for reaching, but to satisfy the sequence length.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence by reaching at turn8, but impossible, as above.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nActions: a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, and a9=S, for example.\n\nBut at turn9, taking S is fine.\n\nSince we are at 9, we could take any, but S is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn9, action S.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t1: a_{t1} = a3=U\n\nTurn t1+1: a4=U\n\n...\n\nTurn t1+5: a8=U? t1+5=3+5=8, a8=U\n\nThen Turn t1+6: a9, but H=7, t from 0 to 6, t=6: a_{t1+6}=a9\n\nAnd t1 + H -1 = t1+6=9, turn9.\n\nAt turn9, we are at position, so we can take a9=S.\n\nIn the action, a9 determines y10, but since we are done, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut for the sequence, we output it.\n\nPerhaps we can have a9=U, but y=9, U to 10 invalid, so probably not allowed, or we must stay within bounds.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=9, U is invalid, similarly D from 0.\n\nSo we must choose action such that y_{t+1} in [0,9].\n\nSo from y=9, only D or S.\n\nSimilarly from 0, U or S.\n\nSo at turn9, if y9=9, we can take S or D.\n\nTo stay, S is fine.\n\nIn this case, with a3 to a8 all U, and a9=S.\n\nBut we need to check if during the path, with a9, but a9 is at turn9, after we have reached, so no issue.\n\nIn the collision, at turn9, we are on y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen action a9, no collision for that action, since collision is only when on freeway at the start of turn.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nBut turn9 is t1+6=9, and H=7.\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, which is 3 to 9.\n\nNow, but in the action for turn6, etc., all fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway1 at turn6, but we are not on it.\n\nPerhaps for freeway3 at turn8, but we are on y=8.\n\nBut let's list the position and freeway at each turn.\n\nTurn 3: y=3, freeway3, not occupied (safe)\n\nAfter a3=U, to y=4\n\nTurn 4: y=4, freeway4, not occupied (safe)\n\na4=U, to y=5\n\nTurn 5: y=5, freeway5, not occupied (safe)\n\na5=U, to y=6\n\nTurn 6: y=6, freeway6, safe (no car issue)\n\na6=U, to y=7\n\nTurn 7: y=7, freeway7, safe\n\na7=U, to y=8\n\nTurn 8: y=8, freeway8, safe\n\na8=U, to y=9\n\nTurn 9: y=9, not freeway, safe\n\nThen a9=S, to y=10? No, S keeps y=9, so y10=9.\n\nBut we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn9, action S.\n\nSince we are at 9 at turn9, and we take S to stay, but the position is already reached.\n\nIn terms of H, it is 7.\n\nBut we could not include a9, but the problem requires H actions with reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn8 with y=8, but we need y=9.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother point: the freeway at turn6 is y=6, which is safe, but freeway1 is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U plus S at the end.\n\nBut to avoid the extra action, but H must be 7.\n\nPerhaps I miscalculated H.\n\nSuppose we reach at turn9 with 6 actions, but for H, to have reach at turn t1+H-1=9, so H-1=6, H=7, must have 7 actions.\n\nSo we need to include the action at the reaching turn.\n\nIn this case, it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps for some paths, we can have a shorter time if we can skip some levels, but we can only change by 1, so not possible.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway6 has a car, but it is always beyond x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nSo H=7\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nIn the output, turn numbers: Turn t_1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nBut turn9 is turn t1+6, and H=7.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc., so for each turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn9 is included.\n\nPerhaps we can set a9 to something else, but S is fine.\n\nSince we reach at turn9, and we take S, it's ok.\n\nI think that's the minimal.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait or something? No, since no need.\n\nFor example, at turn6, if we were on y=1, it would be occupied, but we are not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 7, with the sequence of actions reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 7 - 1 = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined by moving upward (U) at each turn from turn 3 to turn 8, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 9. At turn 9, the action is stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as the position has been reached.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 3**: Player at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Freeway 3 is not occupied (car span at turn 3: \\([-41, -30]\\), 0 not in span). Safe.\n- **Turn 4**: Player at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is not occupied (car span at turn 4: \\([-41 + 6(1) = -35, -30 + 6(1) = -24]\\), 0 not in span). Safe.\n- **Turn 5**: Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is not occupied (car span at turn 5: \\([-41 + 6(2) = -29, -30 + 6(2) = -18]\\), 0 not in span). Safe.\n- **Turn 6**: Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is always safe (car span at turn 6: \\([25 + 36(3) = 133, 60 + 36(3) = 168]\\), 0 not in span). Safe.\n- **Turn 7**: Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is always safe (car span at turn 7: \\([49 + 48(4) = 241, 96 + 48(4) = 288]\\), 0 not in span). Safe.\n- **Turn 8**: Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is always safe (car span at turn 8: \\([49 + 48(5) = 289, 96 + 48(5) = 336]\\), 0 not in span). Safe.\n- **Turn 9**: Player at \\(y = 9\\), not a freeway, so no collision possible. Safe.\n\nFreeways 1 to 5 have collision periods, but the player is never on these freeways during their occupied turns (freeway 1 at turn 6, freeways 2-5 at turns 8-9), so no collision occurs.\n\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H\\) as reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 6 upward moves, starting from turn 3, and the earliest possible arrival is turn 9. The action at turn 9 is S to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9:  S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with their positions and speeds given at turn t1=6.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], since head and tail are given with head > tail for right-moving, I think. Let me check the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so h is head, τ is tail, and since it's right-moving, head is greater than tail. Then at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at y_T and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T. That means the car covers position x=0 at that time.\n\nThe player position is always x=0, since we start at (0,0) and move only vertically, I assume? The player update only changes y, so yes, x is always 0.\n\nSo for each freeway k, at each turn T, we need to check if when the player is on y=k, 0 is in the car's span on that freeway at time T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action a_T to go to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen, at turn T, collision depends on whether you are on y_T and if the car on y_T has span containing 0 at time T.\n\nIf you move, at time T, you are still on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9. y=0 to y=9, so 10 positions? y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn t1=6.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 at some turn T, meaning that at turn T, y_T =9, and we don't collide at that turn or any previous.\n\nNow, the cars: all are moving right, so their spans are shifting right over time.\n\nLet me denote the time from t1=6. So let τ = T - t1 = T - 6, so at τ=0, current time.\n\nAt τ=0, for each freeway, the car span is given.\n\nFreeway 1: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 12. So span at τ=0: [37,48]? No.\n\nIt says for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], and in the table it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: head h=48, tail τ=37, dir right, s=12.\n\nSo span at t1: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ] where τ = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T if player is on y=k and 0 ∈ [τ_k + s_k τ, h_k + s_k τ] for τ = T - t1.\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span is increasing to the right.\n\n0 is in the span if τ_k + s_k τ ≤ 0 ≤ h_k + s_k τ.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we can find the times when 0 is in the span, which is when the car covers x=0.\n\nSolve for τ: τ_k + s_k τ ≤ 0 ≤ h_k + s_k τ\n\nSo, from τ_k + s_k τ ≤ 0, s_k τ ≤ -τ_k, so τ ≤ -τ_k / s_k\n\nAnd from 0 ≤ h_k + s_k τ, s_k τ ≥ -h_k, so τ ≥ -h_k / s_k\n\nSince s_k > 0.\n\nAlso, since the span is [lower, upper] with lower = τ_k + s_k τ, upper = h_k + s_k τ.\n\n0 ∈ [lower, upper] iff lower ≤ 0 and upper ≥ 0.\n\nSo lower ≤ 0: τ_k + s_k τ ≤ 0\n\nUpper ≥ 0: h_k + s_k τ ≥ 0\n\nSo τ ≤ -τ_k / s_k and τ ≥ -h_k / s_k\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the values.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: τ_k =37, h_k=48, s_k=12\n\nτ ≥ -h_k / s_k = -48/12 = -4\n\nτ ≤ -τ_k / s_k = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nτ ≥ -4 and τ ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nBut τ = T - t1 = T - 6, and T ≥ t1, so τ ≥ 0.\n\n-4 and -3.083 are negative, so for τ ≥0, both inequalities cannot hold since τ ≥0 > -3.083? τ ≥ -4 is true for τ≥0, but τ ≤ -3.083 is false for τ≥0.\n\nτ ≥ -4 and τ ≤ -3.083\n\nFor τ ≥0, τ ≥0 > -3.083? -3.083 is negative, so τ ≤ -3.083 is impossible for τ ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, τ ≥ -4 is always true for τ≥0.\n\nBut the critical part is τ ≤ -3.083, which is less than 0, so for τ ≥0, τ ≤ -3.083 is false, so 0 is never in the span for freeway 1 at any τ ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, upper ≥0: h_k + s_k τ ≥0, 48 +12τ ≥0, always true for τ≥0.\n\nLower ≤0: 37 +12τ ≤0? 12τ ≤ -37, τ ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, which is not possible for τ≥0.\n\nSo indeed, for freeway 1, the car is at [37,48] at τ=0, moving right, so it never covers x=0 for τ≥0 since it starts at x=37 and moves away. So no collision possible on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: head h= -48? Tail τ= -59? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 2: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, dir right, s=6\n\nSpan at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Since right-moving, head should be greater, but -48 > -59, yes, since -48 is to the right of -59.\n\nx-axis, increasing to the right, I assume.\n\nSo at τ=0, span [-59, -48]\n\nMoving right with speed 6, so position at τ: lower = τ_k + s_k τ = -59 + 6τ\n\nUpper = h_k + s_k τ = -48 + 6τ\n\n0 ∈ [lower, upper] iff lower ≤ 0 and upper ≥ 0\n\n-59 + 6τ ≤ 0 and -48 + 6τ ≥ 0\n\nFirst: -59 + 6τ ≤ 0 => 6τ ≤ 59 => τ ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond: -48 + 6τ ≥ 0 => 6τ ≥ 48 => τ ≥ 8\n\nSo τ ≥ 8 and τ ≤ 9.833\n\nSince τ integer? Turns are discrete, so T integer, τ integer.\n\nτ = T - t1, T turn number, so τ integer.\n\nSo τ ≥ 8 and τ ≤ 9.833, so τ=8,9\n\nFor τ=8: lower = -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11 ≤ 0, upper = -48 + 48 = 0 ≥ 0, so 0 in span.\n\nτ=9: lower = -59 + 54 = -5 ≤0, upper = -48 + 54 =6 ≥0, 0 in span.\n\nτ=10: lower= -59+60=1>0, not ≤0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head -48, tail -59, right, speed 6. Identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 6) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: same (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 are identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-83, s=36\n\nSpan at τ: lower = τ + sτ = -83 + 36τ\n\nUpper = h + sτ = -48 + 36τ\n\n0 ∈ span if -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 and -48 + 36τ ≥ 0\n\nFirst: -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 => 36τ ≤ 83 => τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: -48 + 36τ ≥ 0 => 36τ ≥ 48 => τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo τ ≥ 1.333 and τ ≤ 2.305, τ integer, so τ=2\n\nτ=2: lower= -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 ≤0, upper= -48 + 72=24≥0\n\nτ=1: lower= -83+36= -47 ≤0? -47 ≤0 yes, upper= -48+36= -12 <0? -12 ≥0? No, -12 <0, so upper not ≥0, so 0 not in span.\n\nτ=2: as above, yes.\n\nτ=3: lower= -83+108=25>0, not ≤0.\n\nSo only τ=2.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-95, s=48\n\nLower = -95 + 48τ\n\nUpper = -48 + 48τ\n\n0 ∈ span if -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 and -48 + 48τ ≥ 0\n\nFirst: -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 => 48τ ≤ 95 => τ ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: -48 + 48τ ≥ 0 => 48τ ≥ 48 => τ ≥ 1\n\nSo τ ≥1 and τ ≤1.979, τ integer, so τ=1\n\nτ=1: lower= -95 +48= -47 ≤0, upper= -48+48=0 ≥0, so yes.\n\nτ=2: lower= -95+96=1>0, not ≤0.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? (-48, -95, right, 48) identical.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -95, right, 48) same as 7.\n\nNow, freeway 1 we said no collision.\n\nSummary of collision times:\n\nFor each freeway, the τ when collision possible if player is on that y.\n\nτ = T - 6\n\nFreeway 1: no collision\n\nFreeway 2: collision at τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same, τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: collision at τ=2\n\nFreeway 7: collision at τ=1\n\nFreeway 8: collision at τ=1\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both at τ=1.\n\nNow, y=9 is the goal, no car, since cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nMinimal number of turns: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum actions are 9 Ups, but we might need to wait sometimes to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t to t+H-1, so H actions to go from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nStart at turn T=t1=6, position y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at turn T=7, y changes, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, after taking action a_{T-1} or something.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t1=6, we are at position (0,0).\n\nWe choose action a_{t1} = a_6, which determines y_{t1 +1} = y_7.\n\nThe update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, then at t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at time t if we are on y_t and for the car on y_t, 0 in span at time t.\n\nIn this case, time t is the turn number.\n\nFor turn T, collision if on y_T and car on y_T has 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, we start at T=6, y=0.\n\ny=0 has no car, I assume, since cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nSimilarly y=9 no car.\n\nSo at T=6, we are on y=0, no car, so no collision.\n\nWe choose a_6, then at T=7, we are on y_7.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe need to reach y_T =9 for some T, with no collision at any turn from 6 to T.\n\nSince we start at T=6, y=0, and we need to end at y=9, the earliest possible is after 9 Ups, so at T=6+9=15, y=9.\n\nBut we might have to avoid collisions, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since we need min turns, probably we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the collision times.\n\nThe collision times are per freeway.\n\nWe need to be on a freeway only when it is safe, i.e., no collision at that time.\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe at certain τ.\n\nτ = T - 6.\n\nList the unsafe times for each y.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, no collision, so always safe.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, unsafe at τ=8 and 9, which is T=6+8=14, T=15\n\nτ=8: T=14, τ=9: T=15\n\nSimilarly y=3: same as y=2, unsafe at T=14,15\n\ny=4: same, T=14,15\n\ny=5: same, T=14,15\n\ny=6: freeway 6, unsafe at τ=2, T=6+2=8\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at τ=1, T=6+1=7\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at τ=1, T=7\n\nNow y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nWe start at T=6, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are at T=7 and T=8 for y=7 and y=6, and later at T=14,15 for y=2,3,4,5.\n\nBut since we are going up, and T=14,15 might not be an issue if we reach early.\n\nFirst, let's see the direct path: go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart T=6, y=0, safe.\n\nChoose a_6 = U, then at T=7, y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe, so at T=7, on y=1, safe.\n\nChoose a_7 = U, to y=2 at T=8.\n\nNow at T=8, y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at T=14 and 15, but T=8 is not 14 or 15, so should be safe? For y=2, unsafe only at T=14 and 15, not at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt T=8, on y=2, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe only at T=14,15, so at T=8, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, choose a_8 = U, to y=3 at T=9.\n\ny=3 at T=9, should be safe, since unsafe only at T=14,15.\n\na_9 = U, to y=4 at T=10, safe.\n\na_10 = U, to y=5 at T=11, safe.\n\na_11 = U, to y=6 at T=12.\n\nNow at T=12, y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 is unsafe only at T=8.\n\nT=12 ≠8, so should be safe? Freeway 6 unsafe only at τ=2, T=8.\n\nAt T=12, τ=12-6=6, not 2, so safe.\n\nThen a_12 = U, to y=7 at T=13.\n\nAt T=13, y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=7.\n\nT=13 ≠7, so safe? Unsafe only at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, a_13 = U, to y=8 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=7, T=14 is not 7, so should be safe? But y=8 is freeway 8, unsafe at T=7 only.\n\nT=14 ≠7, so safe.\n\nThen a_14 = U, to y=9 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, y=9, no car, safe.\n\nBut at T=15, we reach y=9.\n\nNow, is there any collision? In this path, we were on:\n\nT=6: y=0, safe\n\nT=7: y=1, safe (freeway 1 always safe)\n\nT=8: y=2, safe (not unsafe time)\n\nT=9: y=3, safe\n\nT=10: y=4, safe\n\nT=11: y=5, safe\n\nT=12: y=6, safe (not T=8)\n\nT=13: y=7, safe (not T=7)\n\nT=14: y=8, safe (not T=7)\n\nT=15: y=9, safe\n\nBut at T=14, y=8, and freeway 8 unsafe only at T=7, so at T=14 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2 at T=8, unsafe only at T=14,15, so safe.\n\nIn this case, we reached in 9 actions: from T=6 to T=15, that's 10 turns? Let's see.\n\nStart at T=6, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_6, at T=7, y=1.\n\n...\n\nAfter 9th action a_14, at T=15, y=9.\n\nSo we reached at T=15, with H=9 actions? H is the number of turns in the sequence, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nThe sequence is from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=6 to t=14, that's 9 actions, to reach at t=15.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, t1=6, so 6 + H -1 =15, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, t1=6, so 6 + H -1 =15, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, so for H=10, actions a_6 to a_15? t1 + H -1 =6 +10 -1=15, yes a_6 to a_15.\n\nBut at t=15, we are at y=9 after action a_15? No.\n\nTiming:\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAfter choosing a_T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nTo be at y=9 at some turn T, we need y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=15, y=9.\n\nWe arrived at T=15 with y=9.\n\nThe actions: from T=6 to T=14, we choose actions to move to y=1 to y=9.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt T=6, y=0, choose a_6=U, to y=1 at T=7\n\nAt T=7, y=1, choose a_7=U, to y=2 at T=8\n\n...\n\nUp to at T=14, y=8, choose a_14=U, to y=9 at T=15.\n\nSo at T=15, we are at y=9.\n\nAnd no collision at any turn from T=6 to T=15? T=6 y=0 safe, T=7 y=1 safe, ..., T=14 y=8 safe, T=15 y=9 safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought about unsafe times, but in this path, we didn't hit any unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=7, we were on y=1, not y=7. y=7 is unsafe at T=7, but we were on y=1 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, we were on y=2, not y=6 which is unsafe at T=8.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=8, but at T=8 we were on y=2.\n\nAt T=14, we are on y=8, and y=8 is unsafe at T=7, not T=14.\n\nSo all good.\n\nAnd for y=2 to y=5, unsafe at T=14,15, but at T=14 we are on y=8, not on y=2-5, and at T=15 we are on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can go directly up in 9 actions, reaching at T=15.\n\nBut H=10 turns? Let's confirm H.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=6 to t=14, that's 9 actions (t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14), and at t=15, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, t1=6, so 6 + H -1 =15, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut the actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so 10 actions? t=6 to t=15? t1 + H -1 =15, so if H=10, t1 to t1+9=15? t1=6, t1+9=15, so actions a_6 to a_15.\n\nBut a_15 is chosen at T=15, but at T=15 we are already at y=9, and we don't need to move, but the action is to be at y=9 at turn T, so when we reach y=9, we can stop, but the turn when we are at y=9 is the end.\n\nIn the sequence, if we include a_15, but at T=15, we are at y=9, and if we choose a_15, it would go to y_{16}, but we don't want that.\n\nThe sequence should be until we reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this case, after a_14 at T=14, we go to y=9 at T=15.\n\nSo at T=15, we are at y=9, so we don't need to take further actions. So the last action is a_14.\n\nThus, actions from t=6 to t=14, 9 actions, and at t=15 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=9 actions, from t=6 to t=14.\n\nt1 + H -1 =6 + H -1.\n\nAt time t1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, t1 + H -1 =15, t1=6, so 6 + H -1 =15, H-1=9, H=10? Inconsistency.\n\nDefine: the sequence has H actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nStart at turn t1, y_{t1} =0.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the path: at t=6, y=0\n\nAfter a_6=U, at t=7, y=1\n\nAfter a_7=U, at t=8, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_14=U, at t=15, y=9\n\nSo we used actions from t=6 to t=14, that's 9 actions, to reach y=9 at t=15.\n\nSo H=9, and we reach at turn t1 + H =6 +9=15.\n\nt1 + H =15.\n\nGenerally, after H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nWith H=9.\n\nIn this case, it seems possible with no waiting.\n\nBut earlier I thought about collisions, but in this path, we avoided all unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=7, unsafe for y=7, but we were on y=1.\n\nAt T=8, unsafe for y=6, but we were on y=2.\n\nAt T=14, unsafe for y=2-5, but we were on y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states.\n\nAt T=7, we were on y=1, freeway 1, which has no collision ever, as we computed.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 9? From y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, and since we can't go down or stay to reduce, because going down or staying would increase H, so minimal is 9.\n\nWith 9 Ups, we go directly.\n\nSo in this case, it should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nt1=6.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 14: U\n\nBut turn indices: from turn 6 to turn 14.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} with H=9, so a_6 to a_{6+8}=a_{14}, yes.\n\nt1 + H -1 =6+9-1=14.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision definition.\n\nAt each turn T, we are on y_T, and we check if for that y_T, the car has 0 in span at time T.\n\nIn this case, all safe.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 and 8 at T=7.\n\nBut we were not on them at that time.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at the turn we move, we are still on the current y.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should list the positions.\n\nTurn T=6: y=0, action a_6=U\n\nT=7: y=1, action a_7=U\n\nT=8: y=2, action a_8=U\n\nT=9: y=3, action a_9=U\n\nT=10: y=4, action a_10=U\n\nT=11: y=5, action a_11=U\n\nT=12: y=6, action a_12=U\n\nT=13: y=7, action a_13=U\n\nT=14: y=8, action a_14=U\n\nThen at T=15: y=9, done.\n\nNow, for each, collision check:\n\nT=6: y=0, no car, safe\n\nT=7: y=1, freeway 1, car at τ=1, T=7, τ=T-6=1, span: [37 +12*1, 48+12*1]= [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nEarlier I thought freeway 1 always safe, yes.\n\nT=8: y=2, freeway 2, at τ=2, T=8, span: lower = τ_k + s τ = -59 +6*2= -59+12= -47? τ=2, T-6=2\n\nFreeway 2: at τ=0, span [-59,-48]\n\nAt τ=2, span [ -59 +6*2, -48 +6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nUnsafe only at τ=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: y=3, freeway 3, same as 2, τ=3, span [-59+18, -48+18]= [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nT=10: y=4, freeway 4, τ=4, span [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], safe.\n\nT=11: y=5, freeway 5, τ=5, span [-59+30, -48+30]=[-29,-18], safe.\n\nT=12: y=6, freeway 6, τ=6, T-6=6\n\nFreeway 6: at τ=0, span [τ, h] = [-83,-48]?

But from y=0 to y=9, min 9 ups, so no.\n\nUnless we start from y=0, and after first up, y=1, etc., to y=9 after 9 ups.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 6 has a car at τ=2, T=8, but we were not on it.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut I think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are unsafe at τ=1, T=7.\n\nAt T=7, if we were on y=7, it would be unsafe, but we were on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 at T=7, but we avoided it by being elsewhere.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all Ups.\n\nBut the player can choose to stay or go down, but that would only increase H, so not needed.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n\nBut turn 14 is the last action.\n\nSince H=9, turns from 6 to 14.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at T=12, we were on y=6, which is safe, since only unsafe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the note says about moving to different y.\n\nFor example, if at some turn we move to a different y, we are not on that y until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, we moved step by step, no issue.\n\nFor instance, at T=7, we moved to y=1 by action at T=6, and at T=7 we are on y=1.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 6.\n- The target is to reach \\((0, 9)\\).\n- The minimal number of turns to move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 9, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no shorter path exists since moving down (\"D\") or staying (\"S\") would increase \\(H\\).\n- Collision avoidance must be ensured at each turn when the player is on a freeway \\(y = k\\) (for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) by verifying that position \\(x = 0\\) is not in the car's span at that turn.\n\n### Car Collision Times:\nThe collision times for each freeway are derived from the car states at \\(t_1 = 6\\), with \\(\\tau = T - 6\\):\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: No collision at any \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\) (car starts at [37,48] and moves right, never covering x=0).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Collision at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\) (T=14,15).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Collision at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\) (T=14,15) — identical to Freeway 2.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Collision at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\) (T=14,15) — identical to Freeway 2.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Collision at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\) (T=14,15) — identical to Freeway 2.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Collision at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (T=8).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Collision at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (T=7).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Collision at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (T=7) — identical to Freeway 7.\n\n### Direct Path with All \"U\" Actions:\nA sequence of 9 consecutive \"U\" actions from turn 6 to turn 14 results in reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15, with no collisions:\n- **Turn 6 (T=6)**: Start at \\(y=0\\) (safe, no car).\n- **Turn 7 (T=7)**: \\(y=1\\) (Freeway 1, safe as no collision possible).\n- **Turn 8 (T=8)**: \\(y=2\\) (Freeway 2, safe since collision only at T=14,15).\n- **Turn 9 (T=9)**: \\(y=3\\) (Freeway 3, safe since collision only at T=14,15).\n- **Turn 10 (T=10)**: \\(y=4\\) (Freeway 4, safe since collision only at T=14,15).\n- **Turn 11 (T=11)**: \\(y=5\\) (Freeway 5, safe since collision only at T=14,15).\n- **Turn 12 (T=12)**: \\(y=6\\) (Freeway 6, safe since collision only at T=8).\n- **Turn 13 (T=13)**: \\(y=7\\) (Freeway 7, safe since collision only at T=7).\n- **Turn 14 (T=14)**: \\(y=8\\) (Freeway 8, safe since collision only at T=7).\n- **Turn 15 (T=15)**: \\(y=9\\) (safe, no car; target reached).\n\n### Verification:\n- At no turn from T=6 to T=15 is the player on a freeway during its collision time:\n  - T=7: Player on y=1 (safe), not y=7 (unsafe).\n  - T=8: Player on y=2 (safe), not y=6 (unsafe).\n  - T=14: Player on y=8 (safe), not y=2-5 (unsafe).\n- Thus, all positions are safe, and \\(H = 9\\) is achievable.\n\n### Minimal \\(H\\):\n- Since 9 \"U\" actions are required to move from \\(y=0\\) to \\(y=9\\), and no waiting or detours are needed, \\(H = 9\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence consists of \"U\" actions for turns 6 to 14, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting from y=3 and going to y=9, we probably want to move up most of the time, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T. The note says that when you move, you're not on the new row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states. For each freeway, there's one car given, with head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nFreeway 1: car at (-36, -47, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)], but t_1 is 9, so let's set τ = -47, h = -36, s=12, direction right.\n\nThe car update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check:\n\nAll directions are \"right\", so all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: d=right, so span at T: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] with τ = -47, h = -36, s=12.\n\nBut τ is tail, h is head? In the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] initially, then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (-36, -47, right, 12). But in the span description, for right-moving, it says head at h, tail at τ, and span is [τ, h] if right-moving? No.\n\nLook back: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t_1\"\n\nThen for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the entry, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, dir=right, s=12.\n\nSo at t_1=9, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -47 + 12(T-9), -36 + 12(T-9) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince there's only one car per freeway, I assume.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=3 to y=9, without being on a row where 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nAlso, since the player moves at each turn, we need to simulate the position over time.\n\nThe minimal H might be small, like 6 turns to go from 3 to 9 with all U, but we have to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find when the cars are dangerous, i.e., when 0 is in their span for their respective freeways.\n\nSince each car is on a specific freeway, and we care about when 0 is in the span for that freeway at time T.\n\nDefine for each freeway k, the times T where collision would occur if player is on row k at that time.\n\nFor freeway k, with given car, find T such that 0 is in [low(T), high(T)] where low and high are the span endpoints.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] with τ and h as given.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, and 0 must be between low and high inclusive.\n\nNow for each freeway:\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, h=-36, τ=-47, s=12, dir=right\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 12(T-9), -36 + 12(T-9) ]\n\nSet low(T) = -47 + 12(T-9)\n\nHigh(T) = -36 + 12(T-9)\n\n0 in span iff low(T) <= 0 <= high(T)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, find T where this happens.\n\nlow(T) <= 0 <= high(T)\n\nSo -47 + 12(T-9) <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 12(T-9)\n\nSolve:\n\n-47 + 12(T-9) <= 0 => 12(T-9) <= 47 => T-9 <= 47/12 = 3.916, so T-9 <= 3 since T integer? T is turn, so integer.\n\nT-9 <= floor(47/12) or ceil? Let's calculate.\n\n12(T-9) <= 47, T-9 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so T-9 <= 3 since T integer? T-9 is integer, so T-9 <= 3 because 12*3=36 <47, 12*4=48>47.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -36 + 12(T-9) => 12(T-9) >= 36 => T-9 >= 3.\n\nSo from T-9 >=3 and T-9 <=3? Let's see:\n\nFrom low(T) <=0: -47 +12(T-9) <=0 => 12(T-9) <=47 => T-9 <= 47/12 = 3 + 11/12, so since T-9 integer, T-9 <= 3\n\nBecause 12*3=36 <=47, 12*4=48>47, so T-9 <=3\n\nFrom high(T) >=0: -36 +12(T-9) >=0 => 12(T-9) >=36 => T-9 >=3\n\nSo T-9 >=3 and T-9 <=3, thus T-9 =3\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only at T-9=3, i.e., T=12\n\nAt T=12, low= -47 +12(3) = -47+36= -11\n\nHigh= -36 +36=0\n\n0 <=0 <=0? 0 is included, since span includes endpoints? I think so, because it says \"0 in Span(T)\", and span is [low, high], so inclusive.\n\nAt T=12, low= -11, high=0, so 0 is equal to high, so yes, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nT-9=3, T=12.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, head=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, s=6? Table says (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nIn table: \"2 | (-30, -41, right, 6)\"\n\nSo h=-30, τ=-41, s=6, dir=right\n\nSpan at T: [ -41 + 6(T-9), -30 + 6(T-9) ]\n\n0 in span iff -41 +6(T-9) <=0 and 0 <= -30 +6(T-9)\n\nFirst: -41 +6(ΔT) <=0 => 6ΔT <=41 => ΔT <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so ΔT <=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=30 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo ΔT >=5 and ΔT <=6\n\nThus for ΔT=5 and ΔT=6\n\nT-9=ΔT\n\nSo at T=9+5=14 and T=9+6=15\n\nAt T=14: low= -41 +6(5) = -41+30= -11, high= -30+30=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nAt T=15: low= -41 +36= -5? 6*6=36, -41+36=-5, high=-30+36=6, so 0 in [-5,6] yes.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3, same as k=2? Table says \"3 | (-30, -41, right, 6)\" identical to k=2.\n\nSimilarly, k=4: same (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nk=5: same (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nk=6: (60,25,right,36) head=60, tail=25? But for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] I think, but tail=25, head=60, which is fine, but 25<60.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] if τ < h.\n\nHere for k=6, h=60, τ=25, so [25,60] at t_1.\n\ns=36, dir=right.\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 36(T-9), 60 + 36(T-9)]\n\n0 in span: 25 + 36ΔT <= 0? But 25 + something <=0, since 36ΔT >=0 for ΔT>=0, so low(T) =25 +36ΔT >=25>0, so never <=0, so 0 cannot be in [low, high] since low>0 for all T.\n\nSimilarly, high>0, so 0 is never in the span. So freeway 6 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nΔT = T-9 >=0, low(T) =25 +36ΔT >=25>0, high(T)=60+36ΔT>0, so min is 25, so 0 < 25 <= low, so 0 not in span. Yes, safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, (96,49,right,48) head=96, tail=49, s=48\n\nSpan at T: [49 +48(ΔT), 96 +48(ΔT)] with ΔT=T-9\n\nlow=49+48ΔT >=49>0, so always >0, 0 never in span. Safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same as k=7? \"8 | (96,49,right,48)\" identical, so also safe.\n\nNow freeways 2,3,4,5 all have the same car: (-30,-41,right,6), so each has a car that is dangerous at T=14 and T=15.\n\nBut since they are on different rows, we need to avoid being on row k at T=14 or 15 for k=2,3,4,5.\n\nk=2,3,4,5 are rows y=2,3,4,5? Freeway k corresponds to row y=k, I assume.\n\nFreeways are for y=1 to 8, so freeway k is row k.\n\nSo for row 2, car dangerous at T=14 and 15.\n\nSimilarly for row 3, same at T=14,15.\n\nRow 4 same.\n\nRow 5 same.\n\nRow 1 dangerous only at T=12.\n\nRows 6,7,8 always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at t=9.\n\nGoal y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: to go from y=3 to y=9, need to increase y by 6, so at least 6 turns if all up.\n\nBut with actions, each U increases y by 1, S or D don't, so minimal actions is 6 U moves, but we might need to wait or something to avoid collisions.\n\nSince rows 6,7,8 are safe, and we need to be at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car there. y=9 is the goal, not a freeway, so no collision possible there.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=9 is top.\n\nPlayer at (0,y), so x=0 fixed, only y changes.\n\nNow, at turn T, if player is on y between 1 and 8, and if for that row, 0 is in car span at T, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nIf y=0 or y=9, no car, so always safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=9, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nDanger times:\n\nFor row 1: dangerous only at T=12\n\nFor rows 2,3,4,5: dangerous at T=14 and T=15\n\nRows 6,7,8: always safe.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nNow, since we start at t=9, y=3.\n\nIf we go directly up, we can reach y=9 in 6 turns: at t=10, y=4; t=11, y=5; t=12, y=6; t=13, y=7; t=14, y=8; t=15, y=9.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nAt each turn, where we are and if on freeway, check if collision.\n\nTurn t=9: we are at y=3. Is this turn T=9? At turn T, we are at position for that turn.\n\nAt the start of turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that row, 0 is in the car span at time T, then collision.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=9: y=3, row 3. At T=9, is row 3 dangerous? For row 3, dangerous at T=14 and 15, not at T=9. At T=9, for row 3, car span: from earlier, for k=3, which is row 3, at T=9, ΔT=0, span [-41, -30], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nt=10: y=4, row 4. Similarly, at T=10, ΔT=1, for row 4 car (same as row 2,3,etc), low= -41 +6(1) = -35, high= -30+6= -24, both <0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=11: y=5, row 5. T=11, ΔT=2, low= -41+12= -29, high= -30+12= -18, both <0, safe.\n\nt=12: y=6, row 6. Row 6 is always safe, as we saw earlier. So no issue.\n\nt=13: y=7, row 7, always safe.\n\nt=14: y=8, row 8, always safe.\n\nt=15: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=14, y=8, which is safe, but rows 2-5 are dangerous at t=14, but we are not on them, we are on row 8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly t=15, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, we never are on row 1,2,3,4,5 at dangerous times except possibly, but at t=12, we are on row 6, safe.\n\nt=12: y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nIs there any problem? At t=12, row 1 is dangerous, but we are not on row 1, we are on row 6.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=15.\n\nt=9: start y=3\n\nAfter action at t=9: suppose U, then at t=10, y=4\n\nSimilarly, U at t=10, t=11 y=5\n\nU at t=11, t=12 y=6\n\nU at t=12, t=13 y=7\n\nU at t=13, t=14 y=8\n\nU at t=14, t=15 y=9\n\nSo at turn t=15, position y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=9 to t=15, that's 6 actions? Turns: t=9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 6 actions, and after last action at t=14, at t=15 we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=9 to t=9+H-1, and at t=9+H-1 we have y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=6, actions at t=9 to t=14, and at t=14 we move to y=9, so at turn t=14, we are at y=8? Let's see the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn t=9: position y=3 (initial)\n\nChoose action a_9, which sets y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nThen at turn t=10, position y_{10}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the car on row y_T at time T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t=9: y=3, row 3. As above, safe.\n\nTurn t=10: y=4, row 4. At T=10, for row 4, car span: ΔT=1, low=-41+6(1)= -35, high=-30+6= -24, both neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn t=11: y=5, row 5. T=11, ΔT=2, low=-41+12= -29, high=-30+12= -18, both neg, safe.\n\nTurn t=12: y=6, row 6. Always safe, as established.\n\nTurn t=13: y=7, row 7, safe.\n\nTurn t=14: y=8, row 8, safe.\n\nTurn t=15: y=9, not freeway, no collision.\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn t=15, so after 6 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=6.\n\nCould we do it faster? From y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 steps up, so H at least 6. So yes, minimal.\n\nBut in this path, we used row 3 at t=9, but row 3 is dangerous at t=14 and 15, but we are not on row 3 at those times, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue with row 1 at t=12.\n\nSo seems possible with H=6.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, all actions are U.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we are on a dangerous row.\n\nFor example, at t=12, row 1 is dangerous, but we are on row 6, not row 1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, rows 2,3,4,5 are dangerous, but we are on row 8, which is safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nPerhaps we could go faster, but cannot, since 6 steps minimum.\n\nUnless we can move multiple, but no, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo H=6 should be fine.\n\nBut the answer format should be actions starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=9.\n\nSo actions: a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12, a_13, a_14 all U.\n\nThen at t=15, y=9.\n\nH=6 turns? The turns are from t=9 to t=14, that's 6 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_9\n\nt=1, a_{t_1 +1} = a_10\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position, and after action, we should be at y=9.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, we go to y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H -1 might not be 9, but after action we reach 9.\n\nIn the collision, we care about position during the turns.\n\nIn this case, with all U, it works.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row 3 at t=9.\n\nRow 3 car: at t=9, ΔT=0, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,3) at turn t_1=9, which is given.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if row 3 is freeway, yes.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving: when you move, at turn T, if you are on row y, and you move to y+1, at turn T you are still on row y, so you collide only if row y has car at 0 at T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on row y+1.\n\nIn the sequence, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster if we start with S or something, but no, we need to go up.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps.\n\nBut let's see if we can do in 5 steps? That would require increasing by 6 in 5 actions, impossible since max change per action is +1. So H min is 6.\n\nSo with all U, it seems safe.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 1 has a car that is dangerous only at T=12, but we are not on row 1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car for row 6.\n\nRow 6 car: (60,25,right,36) at t_1=9, span [25,60]\n\nAt T, [25+36ΔT, 60+36ΔT], all positive for ΔT>=0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nAnd row 1 only dangerous at T=12.\n\nNow, in our path, at T=12, we are on row 6, not row 1.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps the player could be on row 1 at some point, but we don't need to.\n\nIn this sequence, we go directly from 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9, all in the clear.\n\nBut at t=14, when we are on row 8, rows 2-5 are dangerous, but we are not on them.\n\nSo should be ok.\n\nBut let me list the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{9} = U\n\nThen at t=10, y=4\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{10} = U\n\nt=11, y=5\n\na_{11} = U\n\nt=12, y=6\n\na_{12} = U\n\nt=13, y=7\n\na_{13} = U\n\nt=14, y=8\n\na_{14} = U\n\nt=15, y=9\n\nNow, at each turn:\n\nt=9: y=3, row 3, not dangerous at t=9\n\nt=10: y=4, row 4, at T=10, for row 4 car: ΔT=1, span [-41+6= -35, -30+6= -24], 0 not in\n\nt=11: y=5, row 5, T=11, ΔT=2, [-41+12= -29, -30+12= -18], both neg\n\nt=12: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nt=13: y=7, safe\n\nt=14: y=8, safe\n\nt=15: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=6 with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so H=6.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be the sequence.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? For example, if we stayed or went down, it might take more turns, so worse.\n\nPerhaps at t=12, if we were on row 1, but we are not.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 1 again.\n\nFreeway 1 car: at T=12, span [ -47 +12(3) = -47+36= -11, -36+36=0 ], so [ -11, 0], 0 included, so if on row 1 at T=12, collision.\n\nBut we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 2-5 at T=14: for example, row 2 at T=14, ΔT=5, low= -41+30= -11, high= -30+30=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly T=15, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nBut again, we avoid those rows at those times.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on row 5 at t=11, which is before T=14, safe.\n\nt=11 is T=11, not dangerous.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the player could reach in fewer turns by being at y=9 earlier, but impossible.\n\nOr, another path: suppose we go up faster, but no.\n\nMaybe if we stay at some point, but that would increase H, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we stayed at y=3 for one turn, then go up, we reach at t=16, H=7, worse.\n\nSimilarly, going down not useful.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nBut in the car list, all rows 2,3,4,5 have the same car, dangerous at same times, but since we move through them quickly, before dangerous times, it's fine.\n\nDangerous times are T=14 and 15, we are on row 5 at t=11, which is earlier.\n\nt=11 is before 14.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be all U for 6 turns.\n\nSo for answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t=15, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =9 + H -1, and after action at this turn, we reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, a_{14} is at turn 14, which sets y_{15}=9.\n\nSo turn t_1 + H -1 =14, so 9 + H -1 =14, thus H-1=5, H=6. Yes.\n\nPosition at turn 14 is y=8, then action U, go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nAnd turn 14 position is safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 6. The sequence of actions consists entirely of \"U\" (up) moves, increasing the y-coordinate by 1 each turn, avoiding all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1**: Dangerous only at turn \\(T = 12\\) (when \\(0 \\in [-11, 0]\\)). At turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (safe), not on freeway 1.\n- **Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5**: Dangerous at turns \\(T = 14\\) and \\(T = 15\\) (e.g., for freeway 2 at \\(T = 14\\), \\(0 \\in [-11, 0]\\); at \\(T = 15\\), \\(0 \\in [-5, 6]\\)). The player is not on these freeways at these times:\n  - At turn 14, player is at \\(y = 8\\) (safe).\n  - At turn 15, player is at \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, safe).\n- **Freeways 6, 7, 8**: Always safe, as \\(0\\) is never in their spans (spans are always positive).\n\n### Path and Actions:\n- **Turn 9**: Start at \\(y = 3\\). Action \\(a_9 = U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 10. Collision check: At turn 9, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3), span is \\([-41, -30]\\) at \\(T = 9\\), \\(0 \\notin [-41, -30]\\), safe.\n- **Turn 10**: Position \\(y = 4\\). Action \\(a_{10} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11. Collision check: At turn 10, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4), span is \\([-35, -24]\\) at \\(T = 10\\), \\(0 \\notin [-35, -24]\\), safe.\n- **Turn 11**: Position \\(y = 5\\). Action \\(a_{11} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12. Collision check: At turn 11, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5), span is \\([-29, -18]\\) at \\(T = 11\\), \\(0 \\notin [-29, -18]\\), safe.\n- **Turn 12**: Position \\(y = 6\\). Action \\(a_{12} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 13. Collision check: At turn 12, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6), always safe (span \\([25 + 36\\Delta T, 60 + 36\\Delta T] > 0\\) for \\(\\Delta T = T - 9\\)).\n- **Turn 13**: Position \\(y = 7\\). Action \\(a_{13} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The current turn is t1=12, and I start at y=0. I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and I have to stay within y=0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens if at any turn T, when I'm at some y-position, and for that freeway k=y, there's a car whose span includes 0 at that turn T. The span moves based on the car's direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their positions, right-moving increase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at each future turn relative to x=0, since that's where I am, and I need to avoid being on a row when a car is covering x=0.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I move, I'm still on the current row for that whole turn, and I only change rows at the end of the turn. So when I take an action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, so during turn T, I'm on y_T.\n\nLet me read that carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on row y_T for the entire turn. If I choose to move, I change to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn, so during turn T, I'm on y_T.\n\nTherefore, for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nI need to ensure that for each turn from t1 onwards, when I'm at position y_t, the car on that freeway (if any) does not have 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe cars are only on freeways 1 to 8, so rows y=1 to y=8. y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so I'm safe there. The problem is only when I'm on rows 1-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe because no cars there.\n\nSo, to reach (0,9), I start at y=0 at turn t1=12, and I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is the number of actions, so from t1 to t1+H-1, I take H actions, and after H turns, I'm at y_{t1+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nTurn t1, I start at y_{t1} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, I go to y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, I am at y_{t1+H}.\n\nI want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so positions from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\ny_{t1} =0, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nSo I need to go from y=0 to y=9, which is a change of +9, so minimum turns if I go up every time, but I have to avoid cars on rows 1-8, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since I need to go up, going down might not help, but I could stay to avoid certain times.\n\nThe grid is small, only 10 rows, and I start at 0, end at 9, so I have to go through rows 1 to 8 at some points.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars per freeway? In the table, it lists one car per freeway? Let's see.\n\nThe table has freeway k, and then cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nFor each freeway, it lists one entry, but it says \"Cars\", but it might be one per freeway? Looking at the data:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5 same as 2? -48,-59,right,6\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nFor freeway 2,3,4,5 all have the same car? Or is it one car per freeway?\n\nThe notation is: for freeway k, it gives a tuple (head, tail, direction, speed), so I think it's one car per freeway, since only one tuple listed.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1 has a different car.\n\nSo, each freeway has one car, except that some have the same parameters, but since they are on different freeways, they are different.\n\nBut for collision, on each freeway, we care about that car on that row.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when the car's span includes x=0.\n\nThe span is given at time t1=12.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span moves left, for right-moving, moves right.\n\nAll cars here are right-moving, I think? Direction is given: for freeway 1, direction right, similarly all others are right.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 2: direction right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 3: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 4: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 5: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 6: right, speed 36\n\nFreeway 7: right, speed 48\n\nFreeway 8: right, speed 48\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nSo, for a right-moving car, at time T, the span is [tail + s*(T - t1), head + s*(T - t1)] or something? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation, for freeway 1: (head, tail) = (48,37), and direction right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head] for right-moving? Let's read.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [37,48] since right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: head=-48? head=-48, tail=-59, direction right.\n\nSo span at t1: [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, x=0 is the point we care about.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for freeway k, 0 is in [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince all are right-moving, the span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd τ and h are given at t1.\n\nt1=12.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is not in the span.\n\nThat is, when 0 < τ + s(T-t1) or 0 > h + s(T-t1)\n\nBecause the span is inclusive, I assume, since it says \"includes\", so collision if τ + s(T-t1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-t1)\n\nSo safe when 0 < τ + s(T-t1) or 0 > h + s(T-t1)\n\nWhich is when τ + s(T-t1) > 0 or h + s(T-t1) < 0\n\nSince the car is moving right, as T increases, the span moves to the right, so for early T, it might be left of 0, for late T, right of 0.\n\nSpecifically, the time when it covers 0.\n\nLet dt = T - t1\n\nThen span at T: [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\n0 in span if τ + s*dt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*dt\n\nSince for right-moving, h > τ, so head is greater than tail.\n\nIn freeway 1, h=48, τ=37, so h>τ.\n\nFreeway 2, h=-48, τ=-59, -48 > -59, yes.\n\nSo τ + s*dt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*dt\n\nThis inequality must hold for some dt.\n\nNow, let's solve for each freeway when this is true.\n\nFirst, τ + s*dt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s*dt\n\nSo from τ + s*dt ≤ 0, s*dt ≤ -τ, dt ≤ -τ/s\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s*dt, s*dt ≥ -h, dt ≥ -h/s\n\nAnd since h > τ, -h/s < -τ/s, so the interval is dt from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) or something? Let's be careful.\n\ndt must satisfy -h/s ≤ dt ≤ -τ/s\n\nBecause from dt ≥ -h/s and dt ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nThen 0 in span when dt is between -h/s and -τ/s inclusive.\n\nThen safe when dt < -h/s or dt > -τ/s\n\nBut dt must be integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so dt is integer.\n\nSimilarly, positions, but we care about time.\n\nNow let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, τ=37, h=48, s=12, direction right.\n\ndt min: -h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\ndt max: -τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so since dt integer, dt ≤ -4? Let's see.\n\ndt must satisfy dt ≥ ceil(-h/s) and dt ≤ floor(-τ/s)? Better to compute numerically.\n\n-h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\n-τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nSo dt ≥ -4 and dt ≤ -3.083, but dt integer, so dt ≥ -4 and dt ≤ -3? -3.083, so dt ≤ -4? No.\n\ndt ≥ ceil(-h/s) and dt ≤ floor(-τ/s)\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(-3.083) = -4? -3.083, floor is -4? Floor of -3.083 is -4? No, floor is the greatest integer less than or equal, so floor(-3.083) = -4? -4 is less than -3.083, but -4 < -3.083, and -3 > -3.083? Let's think.\n\n-3.083, integers: -4 < -3.083 < -3\n\nFloor is greatest integer <= number, so for -3.083, integers <= -3.083 are -4, -5, etc, but greatest is -4? No, -4 = -4.0 < -3.083, and -3 = -3.0 > -3.083, so integers less than or equal to -3.083 are ..., -5, -4, and -4 = -4.0 <= -3.083? -4.0 < -3.083, yes, but -3 = -3.0 > -3.083, so floor(-3.083) = -4.\n\nSimilarly, ceil is smallest integer >= number.\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\n- h/s = -4, exactly, so ceil(-4) = -4\n\n-τ/s = -37/12 = -3.0833, ceil(-3.0833) = -3? Ceil is smallest integer greater than or equal.\n\n-3.0833, integers greater or equal: -3, -2, etc, smallest is -3.\n\nAnd floor(-3.0833) = -4.\n\nNow, for 0 in span: dt must satisfy dt >= ceil(-h/s) and dt <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nIn this case, ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(-37/12) = floor(-3.0833) = -4\n\nSo dt >= -4 and dt <= -4, so dt = -4.\n\nNow, dt = T - t1, t1=12, so T - 12 = -4, so T=8.\n\nAt turn T=8, freeway 1 has 0 in span.\n\nFor other times, not.\n\nBut we are at t1=12, so past T=8, so for T>8, since car moving right, span is to the right, so for T>8, h + s dt > h + s*(-4) at dt=-4.\n\nAt dt=-4, τ + s*(-4) = 37 + 12*(-4) = 37 - 48 = -11\n\nh + s*(-4) = 48 - 48 = 0\n\nSo at T=8, span is [τ + s(-4), h + s(-4)] = [-11, 0], so includes 0.\n\nFor dt > -4, say dt=-3, τ + s(-3) = 37 -36 =1, h + s(-3)=48-36=12, span [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nFor dt=-5, τ + s(-5)=37-60=-23, h+s(-5)=48-60=-12, span [-23,-12], 0 not included.\n\nSo indeed, only at T=8, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nSince T=8 < t1=12, for all T >= t1=12, it is safe on freeway 1, because car has passed.\n\nAt T=12, dt=0, τ +0=37, h+0=48, span [37,48], far right, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly for later, so freeway 1 is always safe for T >=12.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, head=-48, tail=-59, s=6, right\n\nτ = tail = -59, h = head = -48\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/6 = 48/6 = 8\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/6 = 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSo dt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(8) =8\n\ndt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) =9\n\nSo 0 in span for dt from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nThus T - t1 =8 or 9, so T=12+8=20 or T=12+9=21\n\nAt T=20 and 21, collision possible on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head=-48, tail=-59, s=6, right, so same as k=2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6) same as freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 and 5 also same: all (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSo for freeways 2,3,4,5, all have car that causes collision at T=20 and 21.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, head=-48, tail=-83, s=36, right\n\nτ = tail = -83, h = head = -48\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\n- τ/s = -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo dt >=2 and dt <=2, so dt=2\n\nThus T - t1 =2, T=12+2=14\n\nAt T=14, collision on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, head=-48, tail=-95, s=48, right\n\nτ = -95, h = -48\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/48 = 48/48 =1\n\n- τ/s = -(-95)/48 = 95/48 ≈1.979\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(1) =1\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(1.979) =1\n\nSo dt >=1 and dt <=1, dt=1\n\nT - t1 =1, T=13\n\nAt T=13, collision on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7? Head=-48, tail=-95, s=48, so same as k=7.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-95,right,48) same as 7.\n\nSo collision at T=13 for freeway 7 and 8.\n\nNow, summarize the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe only at T=8, which is before t1, so always safe for T>=12.\n\n- Freeway 2,3,4,5: unsafe at T=20 and T=21\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at T=14\n\n- Freeway 7 and 8: unsafe at T=13\n\nAlso, for freeways not listed? But all freeways 1-8 have cars, I think.\n\nFreeway 1 has car, 2-8 have cars.\n\nNow, at turn T, if I am on freeway k, and T is unsafe for that k, then collision.\n\nBut I need to be on each row at some point to move up.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn t1=12.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimal steps: if I go up every turn, I can reach y=9 in 9 turns: from y=0 to y=1, then 2, ..., to 9.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on rows 1-8 when it is unsafe for that row at that turn.\n\nNow, at which turns am I on which rows depends on my actions.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1.\n\nSet t = 0 for turn t1, so turn at time t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn t=0 (which is turn t1=12), I am at y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, I go to y_1, and so on.\n\ny_t is position at turn t1+t.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + t, position y_t.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for freeway k=y_t, 0 in span of that car at T.\n\nSince T = t1 + t, and t1=12, T=12+t.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\nFor row k=1: always safe for t>=0 (since T>=12)\n\nk=2: unsafe at T=20 and 21, so t=20-12=8 and t=9? T=20 is t=8, T=21 is t=9.\n\nT = t1 + t = 12 + t, so for k=2, unsafe at T=20 and 21, so t= (20-12)=8, t= (21-12)=9.\n\nSimilarly, k=3,4,5 same, unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nk=6: unsafe at T=14, t=14-12=2\n\nk=7: unsafe at T=13, t=13-12=1\n\nk=8: unsafe at T=13, t=1\n\nNow, for row k, unsafe only at specific t, otherwise safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Row 1: safe at all t\n\n- Row 2: unsafe at t=8,9; safe otherwise\n\n- Row 3: same as row 2, unsafe at t=8,9; safe otherwise\n\n- Row 4: same\n\n- Row 5: same\n\n- Row 6: unsafe at t=2; safe otherwise\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at t=1; safe otherwise\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at t=1; safe otherwise\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=0 to y=9 at some t=H.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, such that y_H =9, and for each time s from 0 to H-1, at turn s, position y_s, and if y_s between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that time s.\n\nAt turn s, position y_s, and we need no collision at turn s, so for freeway k=y_s, it must be safe at time s.\n\ns here is the time index relative to t1.\n\nTurn at time t1+s, position y_s.\n\nFor each s, if y_s in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then it must not be unsafe at that s.\n\nIf y_s=0 or 9, no car, always safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I can go up every turn, so in 9 steps: actions at t=0 to 8, to go from y=0 to y=9 at t=9.\n\ny_t: t=0: y=0\n\na_0=U, t=1: y=1\n\na_1=U, t=2: y=2\n\n...\n\na_8=U, t=9: y=9\n\nNow, at each turn s, position y_s=s, for s=1 to 8.\n\nNow, check for each row at time s.\n\nFor row 1 at s=1: t=s=1, row 1 is safe at all times, so ok.\n\nBut we need to check at turn s, when y_s = k, and k=1 to 8.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt turn s=1: y_s=1, row 1, safe.\n\ns=2: y=2, row 2, is it safe? Row 2 unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but s=2, which is not 8 or 9, so safe? t here is the time index.\n\ns=2, time index 2, row 2 unsafe only at t=8 and 9, so at t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, s=3: y=3, row 3, unsafe only at t=8,9, so at t=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly s=4,5 same.\n\ns=6: y=6, row 6, unsafe at t=2. t=2, s=6? s=6, time index 6, row 6 unsafe only at t=2, which is different, so at t=6, safe.\n\nBut row 6 unsafe at t=2, which is time index 2.\n\nIn this sequence, at time s=2, I am at y=2, not at y=6.\n\nSo for row 6, at time s=2, it is unsafe, but I am not on row 6 at that time; I am on row 2.\n\nCollision only if I am on that row at that time.\n\nSo in the direct up path:\n\n- s=1: y=1, row1, safe\n\n- s=2: y=2, row2, row2 unsafe only at t=8,9; t=2 ≠8,9, so safe\n\n- s=3: y=3, row3, similarly safe\n\n- s=4: y=4, row4, safe\n\n- s=5: y=5, row5, safe\n\n- s=6: y=6, row6, row6 unsafe at t=2; t=2 is time index 2, but now s=6, so not unsafe, safe\n\n- s=7: y=7, row7, row7 unsafe at t=1; t=1 is s=1, now s=7, so safe\n\n- s=8: y=8, row8, row8 unsafe at t=1, s=8≠1, safe\n\n- s=9: y=9, safe\n\nBut what about s=0: y=0, safe.\n\nSo all seem safe? But row7 unsafe at t=1, but at t=1, in this sequence, I am at y=1, not at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, row6 unsafe at t=2, but at t=2, I am at y=2, not at y=6.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 at s=9.\n\nNow, are there any times when I might be unsafe? For example, at s=1, I am on row1, which is safe.\n\nBut row7 is unsafe at s=1, but I am not on row7, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in this case, for row6, it is unsafe at s=2, but at s=2, I am not on row6, I am on row2.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, row7 unsafe at s=1, but at s=1, I am on row1.\n\nSo the direct up path seems safe, and H=9 turns.\n\nBut is that minimal? H is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, with y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, actions from t=0 to 8, 9 actions, y_9=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at time s=1 (turn t1+1=13), row7 is unsafe, meaning if I were on row7 at that time, collision, but I am not, I am on row1.\n\nSimilarly, at s=2 (turn 14), row6 unsafe, but I am on row2.\n\nNow, later at s=8 and s=9, rows 2,3,4,5 are unsafe, but at s=8, I am on row8, which is safe at s=8, since row8 unsafe only at s=1.\n\nSimilarly at s=9, I am on row9, safe.\n\nSo indeed, the direct path seems collision-free.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I start at (0,0).\n\nBut in the car states, for row7 and row8, unsafe at s=1, which is early, but I pass row7 at s=7, which is late, safe.\n\nSimilarly for row6 at s=6, safe.\n\nAnd rows 2-5 unsafe at s=8,9, but I pass them earlier, at s=2,3,4,5, which are safe times for those rows.\n\ns=2 for row2: row2 unsafe only at s=8,9, so at s=2, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo with H=9, I can just go up every turn.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, but 9 is minimal since I need to go up 9 times.\n\nBut I can stay or go down, but that would increase H, so 9 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if at some point I need to avoid, but in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, row7: unsafe at s=1.\n\ns=1, time index relative, turn t1+s=13.\n\nSimilarly, row8 unsafe at s=1, same turn.\n\nIn the sequence, at s=1, I am at y=1, not 7 or 8.\n\nAt s=2, row6 unsafe, I am at y=2.\n\nAt s=8, rows 2,3,4,5 unsafe, but at s=8, I am at y=8, which is row8, unsafe only at s=1, so at s=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn s=0: y=0, action a0=U, go to y=1\n\nTurn s=1: y=1, action U, to y=2\n\ns=2: y=2, action U, to y=3\n\ns=3: y=3, action U, to y=4\n\ns=4: y=4, action U, to y=5\n\ns=5: y=5, action U, to y=6\n\ns=6: y=6, action U, to y=7\n\ns=7: y=7, action U, to y=8\n\ns=8: y=8, action U, to y=9\n\ns=9: y=9, done.\n\nNow, at each turn s, position y_s:\n\ns=0: y=0, safe (no car)\n\ns=1: y=1, row1, safe\n\ns=2: y=2, row2, row2 unsafe only at s=8,9, not s=2, safe\n\ns=3: y=3, row3, similarly safe\n\ns=4: y=4, row4, safe\n\ns=5: y=5, row5, safe\n\ns=6: y=6, row6, row6 unsafe only at s=2, not s=6, safe\n\ns=7: y=7, row7, row7 unsafe only at s=1, not s=7, safe\n\ns=8: y=8, row8, row8 unsafe only at s=1, not s=8, safe\n\ns=9: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nH=9 actions: from s=0 to s=8.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions starting from turn t1.\n\nt1=12.\n\nSo actions at turn 12,13,14,etc.\n\nIn this case: turn 12: U (to y=1)\n\nturn 13: U (to y=2)\n\nturn 14: U (to y=3)\n\n...\n\nup to turn 20: U (to y=9)\n\nt1=12, s=0: turn 12, action, to y=1 at end\n\ns=1: turn 13, action, to y=2\n\n...\n\ns=8: turn 12+8=20, action U, to y=9\n\nAfter action at turn 20, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 12 to turn 20, that's 9 actions? Turn 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: that's 9 turns.\n\nt=0 to 8, 9 actions.\n\ny at turn 20 is 9.\n\nNow, but at turn 20, what is the position? At the start of turn 20, y=8 (from previous), then after action U, y=9.\n\nBut during turn 20, I am at y=8, before moving.\n\nIn terms of collision, during turn T, I am at y_T, and I take action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, at turn 20: y=8, I am on row 8.\n\nNow, row 8 is unsafe only at T=13, which is s=1, turn 13.\n\nTurn 20 is s=8, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought rows 2-5 unsafe at s=8 and s=9.\n\ns=8 is turn 20, s=9 is turn 21.\n\nAt turn 20, I am on row 8, not on rows 2-5.\n\nAt turn 21, if I were on rows 2-5, but I am at y=9, not on those rows.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be on an unsafe row.\n\nFor example, at turn 13 (s=1), row 7 is unsafe, but I am on row 1, not row 7.\n\nSimilarly, turn 14 (s=2), row 6 unsafe, I am on row 2.\n\nTurn 20 (s=8), rows 2,3,4,5 unsafe, but I am on row 8, which is safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to be faster, but 9 is minimal.\n\nMaybe I can reach earlier by going faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so 9 is minimum.\n\nUnless I start from y=0, need to reach y=9, difference 9, each up move +1, so min 9 moves, all U.\n\nIf I stay or go down, it takes more turns.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for row 6, at s=2, turn 14, unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that at turn 13, if I were to go to row 7 or something, but I don't.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nSo for H=9, actions: all U from turn 12 to turn 20.\n\nBut turn 20 is t1 + 8, since s from 0 to 8.\n\nt1=12, actions at turn 12 to turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 12: U, turn 13: U, ..., turn 20: U.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nPerhaps I miscomputed the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: at s=2, turn t1+2=14, unsafe.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 14, I am at y=3? Let's see:\n\nTurn 12: start y=0, after U, y=1\n\nTurn 13: y=1, after U, y=2\n\nTurn 14: y=2, after U, y=3\n\nSo at turn 14, y=2, row 2.\n\nRow 2 is unsafe only at turn 20 and 21, not 14, so safe.\n\nRow 6 unsafe at turn 14, but I am not on row 6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for row 7 at turn 13: unsafe, I am on row 1.\n\nAll good.\n\nMaybe the minimal H is less? No, because I start at 0, need to be at 9, so at least 9 up moves, so min 9 turns.\n\nUnless I can be at 9 earlier, but no, each turn at most +1.\n\nSo I think H=9 with all U is correct.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in less by being at higher rows earlier, but no, I can only move one step.\n\nPerhaps if I start moving, but I have to be at y=0 at turn 12.\n\nAnother thing: y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I need to be on rows in between only when safe.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nPerhaps for row 5 or something, but no.\n\nMaybe I should list the unsafe periods again.\n\nFreeway 1: safe always\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at turn 20 and 21 (T=20,21)\n\nT=20 is t1+8, s=8; T=21 is t1+9, s=9\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4,5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=14, s=2\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=13, s=1\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=13, s=1\n\nIn the path, at s=1 (turn 13), I am at y=1, not 7 or 8.\n\nAt s=2 (turn 14), y=2, not 6.\n\nAt s=8 (turn 20), y=8, not 2,3,4,5.\n\nAt s=9, if I were on y=9, but I reach at s=9, y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at s=9, I am at y=9, no action, but the last action is at s=8 to go to y=9.\n\nIn terms of turns, at turn s=9, I am at y=9, and no collision since safe.\n\nBut the actions are up to the turn when I reach.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions from turn 12 to turn 20, 9 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can stop earlier if I reach before, but I reach at turn 20.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t1=12, I am at (0,0), and I need to take actions to move.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would delay reaching y=9, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, going down not helpful.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 1, but it's safe.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, it should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps there is a constraint I missed.\n\nAnother point: when I move, at the turn I move, I am on the current row.\n\nFor example, if at some turn, I stay, I remain on the same row.\n\nBut in this case, I don't stay.\n\nSuppose at turn 13, if I were to be on row 7, but I am not.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for row 6 at turn 14, unsafe, but if I were to be on row 6 at turn 14, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSo I think the direct path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAfter turn 20 action, y=9.\n\nNow, in terms of H, H=9.\n\nBut the turn when I reach is turn 20, which is t1 + 8, but with 9 actions.\n\ny after H actions is at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=12, after 9 actions, at turn 21? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t1 (12), position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn 12, position y_{t1+1} = y_{13} =1\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1} at turn 13, y_{14}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+8} at turn 20, y_{21}=9\n\ny_{t1 + H} =9\n\nWith H actions from t=0 to H-1, y_{t1 + H} =9\n\nFor example, H=9, y_{12+9}=y_{21}=9\n\nAt turn 21, position y=9.\n\nBut at turn 21, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=12, H=9, actions at turn 12 to 20.\n\nAt turn 21, no action, position y=9.\n\nCollision is only during turns when I am on rows 1-8.\n\nAt turn 21, if I were on row 1-8, but I am on row 9, safe.\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, I am on y=8 (before action), after action U, to y=9.\n\nDuring turn 20, I am on y=8.\n\nAs we said, safe.\n\nNow, at turn 21, position y=9, but no action, and not moving, but collision only when on the row during a turn, but since y=9, no car, so fine.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if turn 21 is problematic, but for rows 2-5, unsafe at turn 21, but I am not on them.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U.\n\nBut let me see if H can be smaller.\n\nFor example, if I start from y=0, after one action, y=1, after two, y=2, ..., after 8 actions, y=8, after 9 actions y=9. So minimum 9 actions.\n\nCannot be less.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut perhaps for some rows, the unsafe time is when I would be there, but in this case not.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 2 to 5 unsafe at turn 20 and 21.\n\nAt turn 20, in the sequence, I am on row 8.\n\nIf I were to be on row 2 at turn 20, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 12: U Turn 13: U Turn 14: U Turn 15: U Turn 16: U Turn 17: U Turn 18: U Turn 19: U Turn 20: U }\n\nBut in the format, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps write it as:\n\nTurn 12: U  \nTurn 13: U  \nTurn 14: U  \nTurn 15: U  \nTurn 16: U  \nTurn 17: U  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \nTurn 20: U\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=12, actions from t1 to t1+H-1=12+8=20.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in the sequence, it's H actions.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because the cars have high speeds and negative positions, but the computation seems correct.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, at s=2, turn 14, unsafe.\n\nIf I were on row 6 at turn 14, but I am on row 2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be thorough, suppose I try to go slower or faster, but it would take more turns or same.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn, then I start later, reach at turn 21, H=10, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo minimal is 9.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in 9 with different sequence, but same.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 12 to turn 20.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- At each turn, the player's position and the car states are checked to ensure no collision occurs. The car spans are computed based on their initial states at turn 12 and their movement rules (all cars are right-moving).\n- **Unsafe Times for Freeways** (relative to turn 12, where \\(s = T - 12\\)):\n  - Freeway 1: Always safe for \\(s \\geq 0\\) (no collision possible after turn 12).\n  - Freeway 2: Unsafe at \\(s = 8\\) (turn 20) and \\(s = 9\\) (turn 21).\n  - Freeway 3: Unsafe at \\(s = 8\\) (turn 20) and \\(s = 9\\) (turn 21).\n  - Freeway 4: Unsafe at \\(s = 8\\) (turn 20) and \\(s = 9\\) (turn 21).\n  - Freeway 5: Unsafe at \\(s = 8\\) (turn 20) and \\(s = 9\\) (turn 21).\n  - Freeway 6: Unsafe at \\(s = 2\\) (turn 14).\n  - Freeway 7: Unsafe at \\(s = 1\\) (turn 13).\n  - Freeway 8: Unsafe at \\(s = 1\\) (turn 13).\n\n- **Player Path and Safety Check**:\n  - Turn 12 (\\(s = 0\\)): Position \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars on y=0). Action U, moves to y=1.\n  - Turn 13 (\\(s = 1\\)): Position \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe at all times). Action U, moves to y=2.\n  - Turn 14 (\\(s = 2\\)): Position \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, unsafe at s=8 and s=9, but s=2 is safe). Action U, moves to y=3.\n  - Turn 15 (\\(s = 3\\)): Position \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, unsafe at s=8 and s=9, but s=3 is safe). Action U, moves to y=4.\n  - Turn 16 (\\(s = 4\\)): Position \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, unsafe at s=8 and s=9, but s=4 is safe). Action U, moves to y=5.\n  - Turn 17 (\\(s = 5\\)): Position \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, unsafe at s=8 and s=9, but s=5 is safe). Action U, moves to y=6.\n  - Turn 18 (\\(s = 6\\)): Position \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, unsafe at s=2, but s=6 is safe). Action U, moves to y=7.\n  - Turn 19 (\\(s = 7\\)): Position \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, unsafe at s=1, but s=7 is safe). Action U, moves to y=8.\n  - Turn 20 (\\(s = 8\\)): Position \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, unsafe at s=1, but s=8 is safe). Action U, moves to y=9.\n  - After turn 20, at turn 21, position \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no cars on y=9).\n\nNo collision occurs at any turn because the player is never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe time. The path directly moves upward without delay, achieving the minimum \\(H = 9\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 15 and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Only at the next turn (T+1) will the player be on y_{T+1}. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T for collision.\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at each future turn relative to t1=15.\n\nFor each car on freeway k, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 15.\n\nLet's note the car update:\n\nFor a car at turn T (where T>=15), the span is:\n\nIf direction is right:\n   Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-15), head + s*(T-15)]\n\nBut note: the given head and tail at turn 15 are for that turn. Also, note that the representation for right-moving cars: at turn 15, the car is from tau to head (with tau < head). Similarly, for left-moving, head < tail? But in the problem, the left-moving example: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. However, in our data, all cars are right-moving.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> but note: if it's right-moving, then the head should be the rightmost? However, the problem says for right-moving: [tau, head] -> meaning tail is the leftmost? But here we have head=-36 and tail=-47, and since -36 > -47, so the head is at -36 and tail at -47. So the car spans from -47 to -36? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\" meaning that the car extends from tail (left) to head (right). So in freeway 1: at turn 15, the car is from -47 to -36 (so 12 units long? because (-36) - (-47) = 11? but note: the car length is head - tail? Actually, the car covers [tau, head] inclusive? Then the length is head - tail + 1? But the problem doesn't specify the inclusive/exclusive. However, for collision, we only care if 0 is in [tau + s*(T-15), head + s*(T-15)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> from -41 to -30? (length 12? because -30 - (-41)=11, but 11+1=12? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the exact grid points, so we'll consider the interval as [tail, head] (closed interval).\n\nBut note: the car update for right: \n   Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 1 at turn 15: \n   tau = -47, head = -36, s=12.\n\nAt a future turn T (>=15), the car will be at:\n   [ -47 + 12*(T-15), -36 + 12*(T-15) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: [ -41 + 6*(T-15), -30 + 6*(T-15) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n   But note: freeway 3,4,5 have the same data: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> so same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 6: (60, 25, right, 36) -> wait, head=60, tail=25? then the car is from 25 to 60? and direction right. Then at turn T: [25+36*(T-15), 60+36*(T-15)]\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\" meaning tail is first? But in the table, it's written as (head, tail, ...) for freeway 6? \n\nLooking at the table: \n   Freeway 1: (-36, -47, ...) -> head=-36, tail=-47 -> so tail is -47, head is -36 -> so [tail, head] = [-47, -36]\n   Freeway 6: (60,25,...) -> head=60, tail=25? Then [tail, head] = [25,60]? \n\nBut the problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then moves to [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So yes, the first number in the tuple is the head? Actually, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\" so the first number is h (head) and the second is tau (tail). \n\nSo for freeway 6: head=60, tail=25 -> so the car is from 25 to 60? But that doesn't make sense for a right-moving car? Because typically we think of the car moving to the right, so the head (front) should be at a higher x? But 60>25, so that's consistent.\n\nHowever, note that the car moves to the right: so at turn T, the entire car shifts right by s*(T-15). \n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8: (96,49,right,48) -> head=96, tail=49 -> [49,96] at turn 15.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,3) at turn 15.\n\nWe can move U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), or S (stay: y unchanged). We must stay within [0,9]. Our goal is to get to y=9.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways 1 to 8 (y=1 to 8). When the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision. However, note that we start at y=3 (which is freeway? no, freeways are 1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3). So we are on freeway 3 at turn 15.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (which is y=k) at a turn T when the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each future turn T (starting from T=15) the car's span and check if 0 is in that span.\n\nBut note: the player's y-coordinate at turn T is the freeway we care about.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nThe maximum upward movement: from 3 to 9, we need at least 6 steps if we always go up. But we might have to wait (use S) or even go down to avoid a collision? But going down would increase H, so we should avoid that unless necessary.\n\nWe must check the collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe'll simulate turns starting from T=15, and for each turn, we choose an action (U, D, S) and then check the next state.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 15 at y=3. We choose an action for turn 15, then at turn 16 we update the position and then check for collisions at each turn.\n\nHowever, at the moment of turn T, we are at y_T, and we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn 15. We can compute the car positions at any turn T.\n\nLet dt = T - 15.\n\nFor freeway 1: \n   Span(T) = [-47 + 12*dt, -36 + 12*dt]\n\nFor freeway 2,3,4,5: \n   Span(T) = [-41 + 6*dt, -30 + 6*dt]\n\nFor freeway 6: \n   Span(T) = [25 + 36*dt, 60 + 36*dt]\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8: \n   Span(T) = [49 + 48*dt, 96 + 48*dt]\n\nWe need to check for which T and which freeway k, the car on k has 0 in its span at T.\n\nBut note: we only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nWe plan a path: a sequence of actions that moves the player from y=3 to y=9.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns from t1=15 to t1+H-1, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at y=9 at that turn? Actually, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And after H actions, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nWait, the update: at turn t, we apply action a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}. So if we start at turn t1, we apply a_{t1} at turn t1 to get y_{t1+1}. Then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t1+H} = 9? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then after H actions, we are at turn t1+H? And we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: at turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=3. Then we take action a_{t1} to get y_{t1+1}, then ... until after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we get y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and we end at turn t1+H.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? Actually, no: the collision check is at the turn when we are on a freeway. Specifically, at turn T (which is between t1 and t1+H-1), we are at y_T, which must be safe (if y_T is between 1 and 8, then the car on that freeway at turn T must not cover 0).\n\nBut note: at the final turn (t1+H), we are at y=9, which is safe (no cars). So we don't check collision at turn t1+H? Actually, we are not on any freeway at turn t1+H because we are at y=9. However, at the previous turn (t1+H-1) we were at y_{t1+H-1} and then we moved to y_{t1+H}=9. So at turn t1+H-1, we were on a freeway (if y_{t1+H-1} is between 1 and 8) and we must check that.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid collisions at every turn from T=t1 to T=t1+H-1.\n\nWe are at turn t1=15: we start at y=3 (freeway 3). We must check freeway 3 at turn 15.\n\nWe then take an action at turn 15 to get y_{16}, and then at turn 16 we are at y_{16} and we check the car on that freeway at turn 16, etc.\n\nLet's compute the dangerous turns for each freeway.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k, the set of turns T (>=15) for which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nFreeway 1: \n   Condition: -47 + 12*(T-15) <= 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-15)\n   => \n      -47 + 12*(T-15) <= 0  => 12*(T-15) <= 47 => T-15 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 => T <= 18.916 -> T<=18 (since T integer)\n      and\n      0 <= -36 + 12*(T-15) => 12*(T-15) >= 36 => T-15>=3 => T>=18\n\n   So T must be >=18 and <=18 -> T=18.\n\n   At T=18: \n      lower = -47 + 12*3 = -47+36 = -11\n      upper = -36 + 12*3 = -36+36 = 0\n      So 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ] -> yes, 0 is the upper bound.\n\n   So freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=18.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 (all same): \n   Condition: -41 + 6*(T-15) <= 0 <= -30 + 6*(T-15)\n   => \n      -41 + 6*(T-15) <=0 => 6*(T-15)<=41 => T-15<=41/6≈6.833 => T<=21.833 -> T<=21\n      and\n      0 <= -30 + 6*(T-15) => 6*(T-15)>=30 => T-15>=5 => T>=20\n\n   So T must be in [20,21] -> T=20,21.\n\n   Check T=20: \n        lower = -41 + 6*5 = -41+30 = -11\n        upper = -30 + 6*5 = -30+30 = 0 -> [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included? yes.\n   T=21: \n        lower = -41+6*6 = -41+36 = -5\n        upper = -30+36=6 -> [ -5,6] -> 0 is included? yes.\n\n   So freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous at T=20 and 21.\n\nFreeway 6: \n   Condition: 25+36*(T-15) <=0<=60+36*(T-15)\n   But note: 25+36*(T-15) is positive for T>=15? \n        At T=15: 25>0, so the entire interval is positive. \n        We need the interval to include 0. But the lower bound 25+36*(T-15) is always at least 25 (at T=15) and increases. So 0 is never in the interval? \n   So freeway 6 is never dangerous.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: \n   Condition: 49+48*(T-15) <=0<=96+48*(T-15)\n   Similarly, 49+48*(T-15)>=49 at T=15 and increases, so 0 is never in the interval.\n\nSo the only dangerous freeways are:\n   freeway 1: T=18\n   freeways 2,3,4,5: T=20,21\n\nBut note: we are only concerned when we are on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, we start at turn 15 at y=3 (freeway 3). We must avoid being on freeway 3 at T=20 and 21? Actually, freeway 3 is dangerous at T=20 and 21.\n\nAlso, we must avoid being on freeway 1 at T=18.\n\nBut note: we might be on a different freeway at T=18? We are currently at y=3. We can move up or down.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. The minimal steps would be 6 steps (if we go up every time). So we could try:\n\n  Turn 15: U -> y=4 at turn 16\n  Turn 16: U -> y=5 at turn 17\n  Turn 17: U -> y=6 at turn 18\n  Turn 18: U -> y=7 at turn 19\n  Turn 19: U -> y=8 at turn 20\n  Turn 20: U -> y=9 at turn 21 -> done in 6 actions.\n\nBut we must check collisions at every turn from 15 to 20 (since at turn 21 we are at y=9, so no collision check at turn 21).\n\nCheck:\n\nTurn 15: we are at y=3 (freeway 3). Is freeway 3 dangerous at T=15? \n   We computed dangerous only at T=20,21 -> so safe.\n\nTurn 16: we are at y=4 (freeway 4). \n   Freeway 4: dangerous at T=20,21 -> safe at T=16.\n\nTurn 17: y=5 (freeway 5): safe (only dangerous at 20,21)\n\nTurn 18: y=6 (freeway 6): we know freeway 6 is never dangerous -> safe.\n\nTurn 19: y=7 (freeway 7): never dangerous -> safe.\n\nTurn 20: y=8 (freeway 8): never dangerous -> safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn 20, we are at y=8? Then we take an action at turn 20 to go to y=9 at turn 21. So at turn 20, we are on freeway 8? And freeway 8 is safe? But note: freeway 8 is safe at all times? yes.\n\nSo the entire sequence: \n   Turn15: U -> y=4\n   Turn16: U -> y=5\n   Turn17: U -> y=6\n   Turn18: U -> y=7\n   Turn19: U -> y=8\n   Turn20: U -> y=9\n\nSo H=6.\n\nBut wait: we must check if at any turn we are on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time. In particular, we are never on freeway 1, and we are on freeways 3,4,5 only at turns 15,16,17 which are not 20 or 21. So safe.\n\nIs there a problem? What about freeway 1 at turn 18? At turn 18, we are at y=6 (freeway 6), so we don't care about freeway 1.\n\nSo this sequence seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous only at T=18 -> we are at y=6 at T=18 -> safe.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: dangerous at T=20,21 -> at T=20 we are at y=8 (freeway 8) and at T=21 we are at y=9 (so we don't check T=21 because we are not on a freeway). So we are never on freeways 2,3,4,5 at T=20 or 21? \n   Actually, at T=20 we are at y=8 -> not on 2,3,4,5. So safe.\n\nTherefore, a minimal H is 6.\n\nBut is it minimal? We need at least 6 steps to go from 3 to 9 (each step up increases by 1). So 6 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We can't because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut note: the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1, so H=6, and the last action is at turn 15+5 = 20.\n\nWe write:\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nBut wait: the sequence is for turns t1+t for t=0 to H-1, so:\n   t=0: turn 15 -> a15\n   t=1: turn 16 -> a16\n   t=2: turn 17 -> a17\n   t=3: turn 18 -> a18\n   t=4: turn 19 -> a19\n   t=5: turn 20 -> a20\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut let me re-check the collision at turn 18: \n   We are at y=6 at turn 18 -> freeway 6: \n        dt = 18-15=3\n        Span(18) = [25+36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108, 60+108] = [133, 168] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nAt turn 20: we are at y=8 -> freeway 8: \n        dt=20-15=5\n        Span(8) at turn 20: [49+48*5, 96+48*5] = [49+240, 96+240] = [289,336] -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn 15: freeway 3: \n        dt=0 -> [-41, -30] -> 0 not in this interval -> safe.\n\nBut wait: freeway 3 at turn 15: the car is at [-41, -30]? So at x=-41 to -30, and we are at x=0? So no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 at turn16: \n        dt=1 -> [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35, -24] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn17: \n        dt=2 -> [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut what about if we try to go faster? We can't. So 6 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could also go down? But that would take more steps. So we don't.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 6 U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We found H=6.\n\nBut let me see if there is a problem at turn 18: we are at freeway 6, but we also have freeway 1 dangerous at turn 18? But we are not on freeway 1, so no.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We are only concerned with the freeway we are on at that turn. So we are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider if we can do it in less than 6? But we need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps required. So no.\n\nBut note: we start at turn15, and we take 6 actions: turns 15,16,17,18,19,20 -> then at turn21 we are at 9. So we don't have to check turn21 because we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, it's safe.\n\nBut let me check if at turn20, when we are at y=8, we are safe? Yes, as computed.\n\nBut wait: the freeway 8 car at turn20: [49+48*5, 96+48*5] = [289,336] -> 0 is not in there.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut note: freeway 1 at turn18: [ -47+12*3, -36+12*3 ] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> so 0 is included. But we are at freeway6 at turn18, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 at turn20: [-41+6*5, -30+6*5] = [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0] -> includes 0. But at turn20, we are at freeway8, not freeway3.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThus, the sequence is 6 U's.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". H is the number of actions? Yes, H=6.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the optimal sequence of actions is to move upward (U) at every turn. This sequence takes advantage of the safe conditions on the freeways during the required turns and minimizes the number of actions to 6, as at least 6 upward moves are needed to increase the y-coordinate from 3 to 9.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 15**: Player at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Car on freeway 3 at turn 15 has span \\([-41, -30]\\), which does not include 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 16**: Player at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4).

Safe. (Note: Freeway 1 is dangerous at turn 18, but player is not on freeway 1.)\n- **Turn 19**: Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Car on freeway 7 at turn 19 has span \\([241, 288]\\) (\\(dt = 4\\): \\(49 + 48 \\times 4 = 241\\), \\(96 + 48 \\times 4 = 288\\)), no 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 20**: Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8).

(Note: Freeways 2–5 are dangerous at turns 20–21, but player is not on these freeways.)\n\nAfter the last action at turn 20, the player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21, which is the goal and has no cars.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\nThe sequence consists of 6 actions (minimal \\(H = 6\\)), starting at turn 15 and ending at turn 20:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=18, and I start at y=0. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe cars are on each freeway from 1 to 8, and they move left or right with given speeds. A collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new y-position, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only check for collision when I'm actually on the freeway at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t=18. For future turns, I need to compute where the cars will be. Since the cars move continuously, but we're dealing with discrete turns, I think the position at turn T is based on the speed and direction.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t₁ = 18.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf d is left, then at turn T, span is [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)]\n\nIf d is right, span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's (48, 37, right, 12). Head is 48, tail is 37, right direction, speed 12.\n\nSince it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I assume. 48 > 37, so head at right, tail at left.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor freeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36). -48 > -83? -48 is greater than -83, so head is -48, tail is -83, but since it's right-moving, the span should be from left to right, so [tail, head] = [-83, -48]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nThe update rule says: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSo for freeway 6: τ = -83? Head h = -48? That can't be right because -48 is to the right of -83? On a number line, -83 is left, -48 is right, so if moving right, tail should be left, head right.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12), so head=48, tail=37, since 48>37, and moving right, so at t₁, span is [37,48]? But the update rule says for right-moving: span at t₁ is [τ, h]? I think I need to interpret the input correctly.\n\nLook at the car state table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) |\n\nFor k=1: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nAnd update: for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h]? But in the rule it says: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] for right-moving\" no.\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t₁\"\n\nThen for left-moving: span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t₁\n\nFor right-moving: span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo at T=t₁, for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ]? [h - s*0, τ - s*0] = [h, τ]\n\nBut for right-moving, if τ and h, with h > τ, then [τ, h] is correct.\n\nIn freeway 1, h=48, τ=37, so [37,48] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6), h=-48, τ=-59, since -48 > -59, so span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\n-59 is left, -48 is right, moving right.\n\nFor freeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36), h=-48, τ=-83, -48 > -83, so span at t₁ is [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48), h=-48, τ=-95, span at t₁ is [-95, -48]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, for freeways 2,3,4,5: all are (-48, -59, right, 6), so same for each.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 are also (-48, -59, right, 6)? In the table:\n\n| 2 | (-48, -59, right, 6) |\n\n| 3 | (-48, -59, right, 6) |\n\n| 4 | (-48, -59, right, 6) |\n\n| 5 | (-48, -59, right, 6) |\n\nAll identical? But they are on different freeways, so each freeway has its own car, I think. So freeway 2 has a car with that state, freeway 3 has another car with same state, etc. But since they are on different y-levels, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 has its car, 7 and 8 have theirs.\n\nFreeway 1 is different.\n\nNow, I need to get from y=0 to y=9. Since I start at y=0, and I need to reach y=9, and I can only change by ±1 or 0 each turn, the minimum number of turns is 9 if I go up every turn, but I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8 when I'm on those rows.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no issue there.\n\nAt turn t=18, I am at (0,0). I take action at turn t to move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=18 to t=18+H-1, and at turn t=18+H-1, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe position after H turns: I start at turn t=18, position y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_{18}, at turn 19, I am at y_19 = y_18 + Δy, and so on.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T when I am on freeway y_T, meaning if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and at that turn T, for the car on freeway k, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nThat is, if the car's span at turn T includes x=0.\n\nAnd since I'm at (0, y_T), so x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when the car spans include x=0 at different turns.\n\nSince the cars are moving, and spans are intervals, I can find for each freeway, the times when 0 is in the span, and avoid being on that freeway at those times.\n\nBut since the spans move, I need to compute for each turn T, for each freeway, whether 0 is covered.\n\nBut I only care about turns from t=18 onwards, and for the freeways I might be on.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and go up, I probably will be going through y=1,2,3,... up to 9.\n\nBut I might stay or move down to avoid, but since I want minimal turns, I should go up as fast as possible, only deviating if necessary to avoid collision.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9, if I go straight up.\n\nBut I need to check if that's possible without collision.\n\nIf not, I might need to wait or go down temporarily, but that would increase H, so I should only do that if necessary.\n\nFirst, let's list all the freeways and their cars.\n\nt₁ = 18\n\nFreeway 1: car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nAt turn T, span: since right-moving, [τ + s(T-18), h + s(T-18)] = [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT] where ΔT = T - 18\n\n0 is in span if 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 37 to 48, both positive, and increasing, so 0 is less than 37, so 0 < 37 + 12ΔT for all ΔT, so 0 is never in the span for freeway 1? Let's see:\n\n37 + 12ΔT ≥ 37 > 0 for all ΔT ≥0, so lower bound is at least 37, upper at least 48, both >0, so 0 is never ≤ upper bound? 0 ≤ 48 +12ΔT is always true since right side large positive, but 37 +12ΔT ≤ 0? 37 +12ΔT ≥37 >0, so always greater than 0, so 37 +12ΔT >0 for all ΔT, thus 0 is not ≥ lower bound, so 0 is never in [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT] because the interval is always to the right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, let's check.\n\nFreeway 2: car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6\n\nAt T, span: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 6ΔT, -48 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6ΔT\n\nSo left: -59 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 59 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 + 6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 9.833, since ΔT integer, turns T=18+8=26 to T=18+9=27?

Let's list:\n\nAt t=18: position y=0, take a_{18}=U, so at t=19, y=1\n\nAt t=19: position y=1, take a_{19}=U, so at t=20, y=2\n\n...\n\nAt t=25: position y=7? Let's see the turns.\n\nt=18: y=0\n\nAfter a_{18}=U, t=19: y=1\n\nAfter a_{19}=U, t=20: y=2\n\nAfter a_{20}=U, t=21: y=3\n\nAfter a_{21}=U, t=22: y=4\n\nAfter a_{22}=U, t=23: y=5\n\nAfter a_{23}=U, t=24: y=6\n\nAfter a_{24}=U, t=25: y=7\n\nAfter a_{25}=U, t=26: y=8\n\nAfter a_{26}=U, t=27: y=9\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9, which is t=18 + H =27, so H=9.\n\nActions from t=18 to t=26, that's 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t=0: a_{18}, t=1: a_{19}, ..., t=8: a_{26}.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H = 18+9=27, y=9.\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 2-5 collision at t=26 and 27, but at those times, I am not on those freeways.\n\nAt t=26, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, and freeway 8 has no issue at t=26.\n\nSimilarly at t=27, y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I am on a freeway when collision happens.\n\nFor example, at t=19, I am on y=1, freeway 1, no collision.\n\nt=20, y=2, freeway 2: car on freeway 2 at t=20, span [-59+6*2, -48+6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], not include 0, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo minimal H=9 with all U.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6 at t=20: collision, but at t=20, I am on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at t=19: collision, but at t=19, I am on y=1, not y=7.\n\nSo I avoid them by not being there at the wrong time.\n\nTherefore, it works.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut the player position is (0, y_t), so y is vertical, from 0 to 9.\n\nIn the action, U for up, increasing y.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is U\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1} U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1+8: a_{t_1+8} which is a_{26} U\n\nt_1=18, so from t=18 to t=26.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=8, so a_{18+0} to a_{18+8} = a_{18} to a_{26}\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me make sure that at t=27, I reach y=9, which is correct.\n\nPerhaps I can do it faster? H=9 is minimum possible since I need to increase y by 9, each action at most +1.\n\nSo cannot be faster.\n\nIf I go down, it would take more turns, so no need.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 1, it was safe, but just to be thorough.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am not on the new freeway until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, it doesn't affect because I don't have issues when moving.\n\nFor example, when I go from y to y+1, at turn t, I am on y_t, I take U, then at t+1, I am on y+1.\n\nAnd collision is only checked at the turn when I am on the freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 and 8, at t=19, collision, but if I were to be on y=7 or 8 at t=19, I would collide, but in my path, I am on y=1 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the freeway 2-5, at t=26 and 27 collision, but at t=26, I am on y=8, not on y=2-5.\n\nAt t=27, on y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 18: U Turn 19: U Turn 20: U Turn 21: U Turn 22: U Turn 23: U Turn 24: U Turn 25: U Turn 26: U }\n\nIn the sequence, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, which is t=18 to 26.\n\nIn the box, list each turn.\n\nSince t_1=18, and H=9.\n\nPerhaps write it as:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = U\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might have collision that I missed.\n\nFor example, at t=20, freeway 6 has collision, but I am on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, freeway 7 and 8 collision, I am on y=1.\n\nAt t=26, freeway 2 has collision? At t=26, freeway 2 car: ΔT=8, span [-59 +6*8, -48 +6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], which includes 0, so yes collision at t=26 for freeway 2.\n\nBut at t=26, in my path, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, not freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=26: as before, no issue.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, it should be correct.\n\nSo the answer is all U for 9 turns.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns required is \\(H = 9\\), as the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate from 0 to 9, and each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1. The sequence of actions consists of \"U\" for all turns from \\(t = 18\\) to \\(t = 26\\), resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 27.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y = k\\) (for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at turn \\(T\\), and the car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\).\n- The car spans and collision times for each freeway are:\n  - Freeway 1: No collision at any turn (span always positive).\n  - Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5: Collision at turns 26 and 27.\n  - Freeway 6: Collision at turn 20.\n  - Freeways 7 and 8: Collision at turn 19.\n- In the path:\n  - At turn 19: Player is on \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1), no collision.\n  - At turn 20: Player is on \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2), but freeway 2 collision is at turns 26 and 27, not 20; freeway 6 collision at turn 20 is irrelevant as player is not on \\(y = 6\\).\n  - At turn 21: Player on \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3), no collision (span does not include 0).\n  - At turn 22: Player on \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4), no collision.\n  - At turn 23: Player on \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5), no collision.\n  - At turn 24: Player on \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6), no collision (freeway 6 collision only at turn 20).\n  - At turn 25: Player on \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7), no collision (freeway 7 collision only at turn 19).\n  - At turn 26: Player on \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8), no collision (freeway 8 collision only at turn 19; freeways 2-5 collision at turn 26 irrelevant as player not on those freeways).\n  - At turn 27: Player on \\(y = 9\\), no cars, safe.\n\nThus, the sequence avoids all collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 9 turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are for turns \\(t = 18\\) to \\(t = 26\\) (9 actions, \\(H = 9\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t_1 = 21, and I'm at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements because I need to know when they are at x=0, since that's where collisions happen. Collision occurs at turn T only if for the freeway I'm on, y_T, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, I'm only on the freeway at the turn when I'm there, so if I move to a new y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nThe player position is updated at each turn based on the action: U for up (y increases), D for down (y decreases), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the cars: each has a head and tail, and direction, and speed. For left-moving, head is less than tail? Let me see the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so h - s(T-t_1), etc. But in the table, all directions are \"right\", so all cars are moving right.\n\nLet me check the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nBut if it's right-moving, the span should be [τ, h] according to the rule, with τ < h, I think?\n\nThe rule says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) = (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nBut for right-moving, if τ is tail and h is head, and it's moving right, then at position, tail should be left, head right, so τ should be less than h? But here h = -36, τ = -47, so τ = -47 < h = -36, so yes, tail at -47, head at -36, and moving right, so as time increases, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAll cars are moving right.\n\nNow, I need to find when for each freeway, at turn T, if there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nThe span at turn T for a car on freeway k at time t_1=21.\n\nLet Δt = T - 21.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 is between τ + s Δt and h + s Δt inclusive, I assume.\n\nSince it's a closed interval [low, high] with low <= high.\n\nIn this case, for right-moving, τ + s Δt <= h + s Δt.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which T, 0 is in the span for that freeway.\n\nBut since I might be on different y at different times, I need to know for each y and each time, if there is a collision risk.\n\nBut y is the freeway, so for each freeway k, and time T, if there is a car on k with 0 in [τ + s (T-21), h + s (T-21)]\n\nNow, for freeway 1: h = -36, τ = -47, s=12, right\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 12(Δt), -36 + 12(Δt) ] where Δt = T-21\n\nSet 0 in [ -47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt ]\n\nSo -47 + 12Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 12Δt\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-47 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt <= 3 since time discrete, turns integer.\n\nΔt is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nT and t_1 are turns, so Δt = T - t_1 integer.\n\nSo -47 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/12 = 3.916, so Δt <= 3\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 12Δt => 12Δt >= 36 => Δt >= 3\n\nSo Δt >= 3 and Δt <= 3, so Δt = 3\n\nThus at Δt=3, T=21+3=24, span is [ -47 + 12*3, -36 + 12*3] = [ -47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included, so collision at T=24 if on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, not.\n\nNow freeway 2: h=-30, τ=-41, s=6, right\n\nSpan at T: [ -41 + 6Δt, -30 + 6Δt ]\n\n0 in [ -41 + 6Δt, -30 + 6Δt ]\n\nSo -41 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -30 + 6Δt\n\nFirst: -41 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 41 => Δt <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, Δt <= 6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 + 6Δt => 6Δt >= 30 => Δt >= 5\n\nSo Δt >=5 and Δt <=6\n\nThus T=21+5=26 or T=21+6=27\n\nAt T=26: span [ -41 + 6*5, -30 + 6*5] = [ -41+30, -30+30] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 in.\n\nAt T=27: [ -41 + 36, -30 + 36] = [-5, 6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5, T=26; Δt=6, T=27.\n\nT=21+5=26, Δt=5; T=21+6=27, Δt=6.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? h=-30, τ=-41, s=6, right, identical to freeway 2.\n\nIn the table, freeway 2,3,4,5 all have (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nIs that possible? Multiple cars on same freeway?\n\nThe table says \"Cars\" but lists only one per freeway, I think it's one car per freeway, but same parameters for some.\n\nFor freeway 3: same as freeway 2, so also collision at T=26 and T=27.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, T=26,27\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=26,27\n\nNow freeway 6: (60,25,right,36)\n\nh=60, τ=25, s=36, right.\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 36Δt, 60 + 36Δt] since right-moving, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nτ=25, h=60, so [25 + 36Δt, 60 + 36Δt]\n\n0 in [25 + 36Δt, 60 + 36Δt]\n\nBut 25 + 36Δt >=25 >0 for Δt>=0, so always positive, never <=0? 0 is less than lower bound since lower bound min is 25 at Δt=0, increasing, so 0 not in interval. Thus no collision possible on freeway 6 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (96,49,right,48)\n\n[49 + 48Δt, 96 + 48Δt], both positive, min 49>0, so no collision.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (96,49,right,48), no collision.\n\nSo only freeways 1 to 5 have collision risks.\n\nFreeway 1: collision only at T=24\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: collision at T=26 and T=27\n\nFreeways 6,7,8 no collision.\n\nNow, I start at turn t_1=21, position y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must stay in [0,9], so I cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at y=3 and need to go to y=9, I need to increase y by 6, so at least 6 turns if I only go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut since I want minimal turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when there is a collision.\n\nNow, the collisions are only on specific freeways at specific times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- On freeway 1 (y=1) at turn 24 only.\n\n- On freeways 2,3,4,5 (y=2,3,4,5) at turns 26 and 27.\n\nFreeway k is y=k, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so k=1 is y=1, etc.\n\nSo y=1 has collision only at T=24\n\ny=2 has collision at T=26 and 27\n\ny=3 has collision at T=26 and 27 (since freeway 3)\n\ny=4 at T=26,27\n\ny=5 at T=26,27\n\ny=6,7,8 no collision.\n\nI start at turn 21, y=3.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn from time t_1=21.\n\nAt turn T=21, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, I take actions at each turn starting from t=21.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t} for t=21,22,...} until I reach y=9.\n\nAt each turn, after action, y is updated.\n\nCollision depends on the y at that turn and whether 0 in car span for that y.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I am not on the new freeway until the next turn? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut during turn T, I am on y_T, so collision depends on y_T and time T.\n\nAfter action, I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo, for collision at turn T, it depends on my position y_T at time T, and the car on that freeway at time T.\n\nIf I change freeway at turn T, meaning a_T causes y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am still on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for example, if at turn T, I am on y, and I move to y+1, then at turn T, I am on y, so if there is collision on y at T, I crash; at turn T+1, I am on y+1, so if collision on y+1 at T+1, I crash.\n\nBut if I stay, at T and T+1 both on same y.\n\nNow, in this case, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps would be to go up every turn, so in 6 turns: from t=21 to t=26, y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9? Let's see.\n\nStart t=21, y=3.\n\nAfter action a_21, at t=22, y=?\n\nThe position is after update.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nAnd at each turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and collision if for freeway y_t, at time t, 0 in car span.\n\nIn the collision condition, it says \"at turn T, collision if for any car on freeway y_T, 0 in Span(T)\"\n\ny_T is the freeway I am on at time T.\n\nNow for the car, Span(T) depends on T.\n\nIn this case, at t=21, I am at y=3.\n\ny=3 has collision at t=26 and t=27.\n\nBut at t=21, no collision on any, I think.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous times:\n\nFor y=1: dangerous only at t=24\n\nFor y=2: dangerous at t=26,27\n\ny=3: dangerous at t=26,27\n\ny=4: dangerous at t=26,27\n\ny=5: dangerous at t=26,27\n\ny=6,7,8: never dangerous\n\ny=9 is the goal, no freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I need to reach (0,9), which is above freeways.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nBut at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at t=21.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H: if I go up every turn, I can be at y=9 at t=21 + 6 = 27? Let's compute.\n\nt=21: y=3\n\nAfter a_21: if U, y=4 at t=22\n\na_22: U, y=5 at t=23\n\na_23: U, y=6 at t=24\n\na_24: U, y=7 at t=25\n\na_25: U, y=8 at t=26\n\na_26: U, y=9 at t=27\n\nSo at t=27, y=9.\n\nNow, check for collisions during the path.\n\nAt each turn, y_t and time t.\n\nt=21: y=3, time 21. Is there collision on y=3 at t=21? Freeway 3 at t=21: span [τ + s*0, h + s*0] for Δt=0, but t=21, Δt=0.\n\nAt t=21, for freeway 3: span [ -41 +0, -30 +0] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nt=22: y=4 (since after a_21=U, y=4 at t=22)\n\nAt t=22, on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: same as others, at t=22, Δt=1, span [ -41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=23: y=5 (after a_22=U), on y=5 at t=23.\n\nSpan [ -41 +6*2, -30 +6*2] = [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=24: y=6 (after a_23=U), on y=6 at t=24.\n\nBut y=6 has no collision, freeway 6 no car at x=0 ever, so safe.\n\nt=25: y=7, on y=7, no collision, safe.\n\nt=26: y=8, on y=8, no collision, safe.\n\nt=27: y=9, not a freeway, safe, and reached goal.\n\nBut at t=26, I am at y=8, which is safe, and t=27 y=9.\n\nIn this path, I was never on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time.\n\nAt t=24, I was on y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut y=1 is dangerous at t=24, but I was not on y=1.\n\ny=3 is dangerous at t=26 and 27, but at t=26 I was on y=8, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly t=27 I am at y=9.\n\nSo in this case, I can reach in 6 turns, at t=27.\n\nBut t=21 to t=27 is 6 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at t=21, position y=3.\n\nAfter action a_21, at t=22, y=4\n\nAfter a_22, at t=23, y=5\n\nAfter a_23, at t=24, y=6\n\nAfter a_24, at t=25, y=7\n\nAfter a_25, at t=26, y=8\n\nAfter a_26, at t=27, y=9\n\nSo I take actions at t=21 to t=26, 6 actions, and at t=27 I am at y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=21 to t=21+H-1, so at turn t=21+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=27, y=9, so t=21 + H -1 =27, so 21 + H -1 =27, thus H-1=6, H=7? No.\n\nt_{t_1 + H -1} = y=9\n\nt_1 =21, so 21 + H -1 = T where y_T=9.\n\nIn this sequence, y=9 at t=27, so 21 + H -1 =27, so 20 + H =27, H=7.\n\nBut I took 6 actions: from t=21 to t=26.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set, but we need at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThe player position: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter actions from t to t+H-1, y_{t+H} is set, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t, before action, position is given.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, before action, position should be (0,9)? No.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), meaning at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFrom the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\" and after that action, at turn t_1 + H, y should be 9, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 + 0 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position at time t_1 + H should be (0,9)? Not necessarily.\n\nThe position after action: after a_{t} at time t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} at time t_1 + H -1, y_{(t_1 + H -1) +1} = y_{t_1 + H} is set to 9.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1? Confusion.\n\nLook at the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9 means at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is (0,9).\n\nBut at turn t, position is before action or after?\n\nIn the game dynamics, at each turn, position is given, then action, then position updates for next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is computed, and at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1})\n\nSo y_t is the position at turn t.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, we specify actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we don't care as long as at t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIf at t_1 + H -1, y=9, that means we are already at goal at that turn, so we don't need to take further actions, but the action a_{t_1 + H -1} might be taken, but since we are at y=9, if we choose S, y stays 9, or if U or D, it might go to 10 or 8, but y must be in [0,9], so if y=9, U would try to go to 10, but y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Δy, 0),9), I assume, since y in [0,9].\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so it must be clamped.\n\nBut in this case, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn the minimal path I thought, at t=27, y=9, which is turn t=27.\n\nt_1=21, so y_{21 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo 21 + H -1 =27, thus H-1=6, H=7.\n\nAnd actions from t=21 to t=26 (t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =21 to 27-1=26? t_1 + H -1 =21 +7 -1=27.\n\nLet k = H -1, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + k, and at turn t_1 + k, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn t=27, y=9, so t_1 + k =27, with t_1=21, so k=6, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions at t=21,22,23,24,25,26 all U, to go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps.\n\nt=21: start y=3, after a_21=U, y=4 at t=22\n\nt=22: y=4, after a_22=U, y=5 at t=23\n\n...\n\nt=26: y=8, after a_26=U, y=9 at t=27\n\nAt turn t=27, y=9, so for turn t=27, we have y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{21 + H -1} = y_27 =9, so 21 + H -1 =27, H=7.\n\nAnd actions at t=21 to t=26.\n\nIn this path, as I checked, no collision: at t=21, y=3, safe; t=22 y=4 safe; t=23 y=5 safe; t=24 y=6 safe; t=25 y=7 safe; t=26 y=8 safe; t=27 y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is there a faster way? For example, can I reach earlier?\n\nMinimal steps: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so at least 6 actions if all up, but after 6 actions, I would be at y=9 at turn t=21+6=27, same as above.\n\nt=21: after 0 actions, y=3\n\nAfter 1 action (a_21), at t=22, y=4\n\nAfter 2 actions, t=23, y=5\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions, t=27, y=9\n\nSo I cannot reach before t=27, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nAt turn t=21, y=3, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe earliest turn to be at y=9 is t=27, by going up every turn from t=21 to t=26.\n\nAnd in this case, it works, as above.\n\nBut why did I think about collisions? Because in this path, I avoided all dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at t=24, I was on y=6, not on y=1 which is dangerous.\n\nAt t=26, I was on y=8, not on y=3 which is dangerous at t=26.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision times.\n\nFreeway y=1 dangerous at t=24 only.\n\nBut I was on y=6 at t=24, safe.\n\ny=2 dangerous at t=26 and 27: at t=26, I was on y=8, safe; at t=27, if I were on y=2, but I am at y=9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a way to reach at t=26? For example, if I start at y=3 at t=21, after 5 actions, at t=26, I could be at y=8 or y=9?\n\nAfter 5 actions: from t=21 to t=25 actions.\n\nAfter a_21, t=22 y=?\n\nIf all U: a_21 U, t=22 y=4; a_22 U, t=23 y=5; a_23 U, t=24 y=6; a_24 U, t=25 y=7; a_25 U, t=26 y=8.\n\nAt t=26, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=26, I need y_{26} =9.\n\nAt t=26, position is y_26.\n\ny_26=9 means at turn 26, I am at y=9.\n\nBut from start, at t=21 y=3.\n\nIn 5 steps: actions at t=21,22,23,24,25 to reach y=9 at t=26.\n\nEach action can increase y by 1, so from y=3 at t=21, after 5 ups, at t=26 y=8, not 9.\n\nAfter 5 actions, y_{26} = y_{21} + sum Δy from t=21 to 25.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\ny_{21} =3\n\ny_{22} = y_{21} + Δy_{21}\n\ny_{23} = y_{22} + Δy_{22} = y_{21} + Δy_{21} + Δy_{22}\n\n...\n\ny_{26} = y_{21} + Δy_{21} + Δy_{22} + Δy_{23} + Δy_{24} + Δy_{25}\n\nSince y_{21} =3, to have y_{26}=9, need sum_{k=21}^{25} Δy_k =6.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so minimal 6 steps? But here 5 terms, from k=21 to 25 inclusive, that's 5 actions.\n\nΔy from a_{21} to a_{25}, 5 actions, each can contribute at most +1, so max y_{26} = 3 + 5*1 =8 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=26.\n\nSimilarly, at t=25: y_{25} = y_{21} + sum_{k=21}^{24} Δy_k, 4 actions, max y=3+4=7.\n\nAt t=24: max y=3+3=6? Actions from t=21 to t=23 for y_{24}.\n\ny_{24} = y_{21} + Δy_{21} + Δy_{22} + Δy_{23}\n\n3 actions, max y=6 at t=24.\n\nBut we need y=9, so earliest possible is t=27 with 6 up actions.\n\nAnd we achieved it without collision.\n\nBut in the path, at t=26, I am at y=8, and freeway y=8 has no collision, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=3 being dangerous at t=26, but in this path, at t=26 I am not on y=3.\n\nSo why did I think I might have a problem?\n\nPerhaps if I were slower.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if I can be faster, but I cannot.\n\nPerhaps with down actions, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimal H=7, with all U actions.\n\nBut H=7, actions from t=21 to t=26.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn 21: U, Turn 22: U, ..., Turn 26: U.\n\nBut at t=26, action U, to go to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut in the position, at turn t=26, I am at y=8, and I take U to go to y=9.\n\nNow, at turn t=26, I am on y=8, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThen at t=27, I am at y=9, goal.\n\nNow, but is there any issue with the cars?\n\nAnother thing: at t=24, on y=6, but freeway 6 has a car, but as we saw, it never has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: car at t=21: span [25,60], all positive, moving right, so at any T, span [25 + 36(T-21), 60 + 36(T-21)], since T-21>=0, min at T=21 is 25>0, so 0 never in, good.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nNow, for y=3, dangerous at t=26 and 27.\n\nAt t=26, in my path, I am at y=8, not y=3.\n\nBut suppose I stayed on y=3 longer, but I don't need to.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be minimal H, which is 7.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier with different path? Impossible.\n\nPerhaps by going down to avoid, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=2 or something, but then I need more steps to go up, so H larger, worse.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about y=1 at t=24, but I didn't go there.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I pass through dangerous points.\n\nBut in this case, I didn't.\n\nAnother thing: at t=26 and t=27, y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous.\n\nIn my path, at t=26, I am at y=8, which is fine.\n\nAt t=27, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nBut suppose I was at y=5 at t=26, then I would crash, but I am not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can start by staying or something, but that delays, so worse.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all actions U.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 27, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from t=21 to t=21 + H -1 =21+6=27? t_1 + H -1 =21 +7 -1=27.\n\nActions at t=21 to t=26, which is t_1 to t_1 +5? Let's index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=21, H=7, so t from 21+0=21 to 21+6=27? t=0 to H-1=6, so t_1 + t for t=0 to 6: 21,22,23,24,25,26,27.\n\nBut actions at turn 21 to 27? But at turn 27, if I am at y=9, I don't need to take action, but in the sequence, I have to specify up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =21+7-1=27.\n\nAction at turn 27.\n\nBut at turn 27, if I am at y=9, and I need to take an action.\n\nIn the sequence, I take actions until t=27.\n\nBut after action at t=27, y_{28} is set, but I need y_{27}=9 at turn 27.\n\nAt turn 27, position y_27=9.\n\nThen I take action a_27, which sets y_{28}, but y_{28} could be 9 if S, or 10 if U, but since y in [0,9], if U, y_{28}=min(10,9)=9, similarly.\n\nBut in this case, since I am at y=9 at t=27, I can take S to stay, or U or D, but it doesn't matter for reaching.\n\nBut in the minimal sequence, I don't need to take extra action.\n\nIn my earlier plan, with actions from t=21 to t=26 all U, at t=27 y=9.\n\nSo at turn t=27, I am at y=9, so I don't need to take action at t=27.\n\nBut the sequence requires actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which includes t=27.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =21+7-1=27.\n\nSo I need to specify a_{27}.\n\nSince y_{27}=9, I can choose a_{27}=S to stay at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the action sequence, for turns 21 to 26: U, and at 27: S.\n\nBut I can choose U or D, but it will stay at 9.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nIn terms of the path, I reached at t=27 with 6 actions, but now with H=7, I have 7 actions, including one at t=27.\n\nBut at t=27, I am already at y=9, so the action a_{27} is after reaching.\n\nBut the task says: sequence of actions to reach, meaning that after the actions, I have reached.\n\nBut specifically, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means at that turn, I am at 9, before taking the action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThen I take the action, which may change y, but since I am at 9, and action is taken, y_{t_1 + H} may be 9 or something else.\n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at that point, I have reached, and the action at that turn doesn't affect reaching, but I have to specify it.\n\nIn this case, for H=7, at turn t= t_1 + H -1 =21+7-1=27, y_{27}=9.\n\nThen I take a_{27}, which could be S, U, or D, but to stay safe, probably S.\n\nIn the collision, at turn t=27, if I am on a freeway, but y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, after action, y_{28} doesn't matter.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to include a_{27}.\n\nIn my path, with actions only to t=26, at t=27 y=9, so for the sequence, I can have actions at t=21 to t=26: U, and at t=27: S.\n\nBut with H=7.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with H=6, but earlier I thought impossible.\n\nH=6: t_1 + H -1 =21+6-1=26.\n\nSo y_{26} must be 9.\n\nBut from y_{21}=3, to y_{26}=9 in 5 steps: y_{26} = y_{21} + sum_{k=21}^{25} Δy_k\n\n5 terms, each <=1, so max y_{26} =3+5=8<9, impossible.\n\nThus H=6 is impossible.\n\nMinimal H is 7.\n\nWith y_{27}=9.\n\nActions: for t=21 to 26: U, and for t=27, since y_{27}=9, I need to specify a_{27}, which can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=21,22,23,24,25,26,27.\n\nBut at t=27, I take action after being at y=9.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I can set a_{27}=S.\n\nNow, about collisions: in this sequence, turns and positions:\n\nt=21: y=3, action U, then y=4 at t=22\n\nAt turn t=21, I am on y=3, which at t=21 is safe, as span [-41,-30] no 0.\n\nt=22: y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=23\n\nAt t=22, on y=4, span at t=22: for y=4, freeway 4, Δt=1, [ -41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nt=23: y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=24\n\nAt t=23, on y=5, span Δt=2, [ -41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], no 0, safe.\n\nt=24: y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=25\n\nAt t=24, on y=6, no collision possible, safe.\n\nt=25: y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=26\n\nAt t=25, on y=7, no collision, safe.\n\nt=26: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=27\n\nAt t=26, on y=8, no collision, safe.\n\nt=27: y=9, action S (or whatever), to y=9 at t=28, but we don't care.\n\nAt t=27, on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nBut H=7, actions at t=21 to 27.\n\nIn the answer, it should be minimal H, which is 7.\n\nBut perhaps I can have a shorter sequence if I start later, but no.\n\nAnother idea: can I reach y=9 at an earlier turn by going faster? But no, since only +1 per step.\n\nUnless I can skip, but no.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 has a car that is dangerous at t=24, but I didn't go to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid being on certain y at certain times, but in this case, I didn't encounter any issue.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,3), and I need to go to (0,9).\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\n}\n\nBut for turn 27, since I am at y=9, S is fine, or I can put U, but it will stay 9.\n\nBut S might be better to specify no move.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn t_1 + H -1 =27, and after that, y_{28} is set, but since we reached at t=27, it's fine.\n\nTo be precise, with H=7, y_{27}=9, and I take a_{27}=S.\n\nNow, but in the initial thought, I had only 6 actions to reach, but with H=7, I have an extra action at the end.\n\nBut it is required to have y at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps I can define the sequence such that after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nI think I should stick to the task.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but I cannot with H=6.\n\nAnother point: in the car update, for freeway 1, at t=24 dangerous, but I was on y=6.\n\nBut suppose I was on y=1 at t=24, I would crash, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3 at t=26, but I am not there.\n\nBut in my path, at t=26, I am on y=8.\n\nt=26, y=8.\n\nBut freeway y=5 is dangerous at t=26, but I am not on it.\n\nSo I think no problem.\n\nPerhaps I should list all dangerous (y,t) pairs:\n\n- (y=1, t=24)\n\n- (y=2, t=26)\n\n- (y=2, t=27)\n\n- (y=3, t=26)\n\n- (y=3, t=27)\n\n- (y=4, t=26)\n\n- (y=4, t=27)\n\n- (y=5, t=26)\n\n- (y=5, t=27)\n\nAnd y=6,7,8 safe at all times.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nIn my path:\n\nt=21: y=3, but t=21 not dangerous for y=3\n\nt=22: y=4, t=22 not dangerous (dangerous only at 26,27)\n\nt=23: y=5, t=23 not dangerous\n\nt=24: y=6, safe\n\nt=25: y=7, safe\n\nt=26: y=8, safe\n\nt=27: y=9, safe\n\nAll clear.\n\nIf I had stayed on y=3 at t=26, it would be dangerous, but I moved up.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 27, I put S, but I could put anything, but S is appropriate.\n\nTo save, I could have reached at t=26 with y=9, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 21\\) is 7. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 21 to turn 26, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 27. At turn 27, since the player is already at the goal, the action is stay (S) to maintain position.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 21 and moves up each turn, avoiding all dangerous freeways at critical times:\n  - At turn 24, \\(y = 1\\) is dangerous due to a car, but the player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe.\n  - At turns 26 and 27, \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are dangerous, but:\n    - At turn 26, the player is at \\(y = 8\\), which is safe.\n    - At turn 27, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n- Freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) have no collisions at any time, as their car spans never contain \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 21 to 27 (i.e., \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 6\\)) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: S\n}",

The player starts at y=0 and wants to get to y=9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0).\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y (and hence subject to the cars on that freeway at turn T). Then after the move, at turn T+1 the player will be on y'. So the collision check at turn T is for the freeway y (the starting freeway of the move).\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns starting at t1=24 until we reach y=9.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car on freeway i (which is a row, and we are given the state at turn t1=24):\n- Left-moving: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (but note: in the given data, the direction is either 'right' or 'left'. In the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check the given table:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37? But note: for right-moving, the head is the front which is the larger x? Actually the problem says for right-moving: span(t1) = [tau, h] meaning tau is the tail (left end) and h is the head (right end). Then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> so at t1=24, the car is at [37,48] (since right-moving: [tau, h] = [37,48]). Then at time T (>=24), the car is at [37+12*(T-24), 48+12*(T-24)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> so [tau, h] = [-59, -48] (because tail is -59 and head is -48). Then at T: [-59+6*(T-24), -48+6*(T-24)].\n\nBut note: the problem says that the car state is given at t1=24.\n\nWe are to avoid being at a freeway y at turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 24. We are at y=0 at turn 24, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8) so no collision at turn 24.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 (which is also not a freeway) so we don't check for collisions at y=9.\n\nWe must plan the moves so that whenever we are at a freeway y (1..8) at some turn T, then at that turn T, for the car(s) on freeway y, 0 must not be in the car's span.\n\nNote: if we move from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T we are on y and must avoid the car on y at T, and then at turn T+1 we are on y' and must avoid the car on y' at T+1.\n\nWe can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1) or stay (S: same y). But we are bounded: y must be between 0 and 9. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are starting at y=0 at turn 24. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves if there were no cars: we could go up 9 times (so 9 turns). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions from turn 24 onward until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns.\n\nWe can try to simulate the moves and check for collisions at each step.\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to 8). For each freeway, we have one car (as per the table). We have the state at t1=24.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (>=24) the position of the car.\n\nLet me compute the car positions for each freeway at a given turn T (relative to T0 = 24).\n\nDefine delta_t = T - 24.\n\nThen for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): \n  car: (h=48, tau=37, d=right, s=12)\n  at T: [37 + 12*delta_t, 48 + 12*delta_t]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): \n  car: (h=-48, tau=-59, d=right, s=6)\n  at T: [-59 + 6*delta_t, -48 + 6*delta_t]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2? \n  car: (h=-48, tau=-59, d=right, s=6) -> same as freeway2? But note: the table says:\n  | 2 | (-48, -59, right, 6) |\n  | 3 | (-48, -59, right, 6) |\n  So freeway3 has the same car? Actually, each freeway has its own car.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 and 3? \n  | 4 | (-48, -59, right, 6) | -> same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36) \n  at T: [-83 + 36*delta_t, -48 + 36*delta_t]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n  at T: [-95 + 48*delta_t, -48 + 48*delta_t]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? \n  | 8 | (-48, -95, right, 48) | -> same.\n\nSo freeways 2,3,4,5 are identical? and freeways 7 and 8 are identical.\n\nBut note: they are on different rows. So we have to check each row separately.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We want to get from y=0 to y=9 as fast as possible, so we prefer moving up. But we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe are going to consider the state (turn, y) and check for collisions when y is between 1 and 8.\n\nWe start at (t=24, y=0). Then we take an action at turn 24, which will lead to a new y at turn 25? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T. Then the next state is at turn T+1: y_{T+1} = y_T + delta_y.\n\nBut note: during turn T, we are at y_T. So if y_T is in [1,8], we must check the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T and we choose an action. Then at turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}. The collision at turn T is for y_T (if it's a freeway) and at turn T+1 for y_{T+1} (if it's a freeway) and so on.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions that gets us from (t=24, y=0) to (t=24+H-1, y=9) without any collision in between.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (t, y) to find the minimal H.\n\nBut note: the turn t can be large? However, because the cars move and eventually the cars will pass 0 and then we can go? We need to see the timing.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway the intervals of time (delta_t) when the car covers 0.\n\nFor a freeway, the car covers 0 at time T (i.e., delta_t) if 0 is in [L, R] (the span at T).\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n  Condition: 37 + 12*delta_t <= 0 <= 48 + 12*delta_t\n  => 37 + 12*delta_t <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 12*delta_t\n  => 12*delta_t <= -37 -> delta_t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> but delta_t>=0, so no solution? \n  Actually, let me solve:\n  We require: L <= 0 <= R\n  => 37 + 12*delta_t <= 0 <= 48 + 12*delta_t\n  The second inequality: 0 <= 48+12*delta_t -> always true for delta_t>=0? because 48+12*delta_t >=48>0? \n  Then the first: 37+12*delta_t <=0 -> 12*delta_t <= -37 -> delta_t <= -37/12 -> which is negative. \n  So for freeway1, the car never covers 0 at any T>=24? \n\nLet me check: at delta_t=0: the car is at [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48] (since 37>0). And as the car moves right, the entire segment moves right, so 0 will never be covered? \n\nSo freeway1 is safe at all times.\n\nFreeway2 (and similarly 3,4,5): \n  car: [-59 + 6*delta_t, -48 + 6*delta_t]\n  Condition: -59 + 6*delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 6*delta_t\n  => \n    -59 + 6*delta_t <= 0  => 6*delta_t <= 59 -> delta_t <= 59/6 ≈ 9.83\n    and 0 <= -48 + 6*delta_t => 6*delta_t >=48 => delta_t >= 8.\n\n  So for freeway2, the car covers 0 when 8 <= delta_t <= 9 (since delta_t must be integer? yes, turns are integers).\n\n  Let me check:\n    delta_t=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ] -> yes, 0 is the right endpoint? so yes.\n    delta_t=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5, 6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? yes.\n\n    But note: the interval is [L,R] inclusive? yes, because the car has a tail and head.\n\n  So freeway2 is unsafe for delta_t in [8,9]? Actually, 8 and 9.\n\n  But wait: the condition is L<=0<=R -> at delta_t=8: L=-11, R=0 -> so 0 is the right endpoint -> included? yes.\n\n  However, note that the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". But that doesn't affect the current freeway.\n\n  So for freeway2, we must avoid being on freeway2 at turns 24+8=32 and 24+9=33.\n\n  Similarly, freeway3,4,5: same condition.\n\nFreeway6: \n  car: [-83 + 36*delta_t, -48 + 36*delta_t]\n  Condition: -83 + 36*delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 36*delta_t\n  => \n    -83 + 36*delta_t <= 0 -> 36*delta_t <= 83 -> delta_t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> so delta_t <= 2 (integer)\n    and 0 <= -48 + 36*delta_t -> 36*delta_t >=48 -> delta_t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 -> so delta_t>=2? (since integer)\n\n  So delta_t must be 2? \n    Check: \n      delta_t=2: [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? yes.\n      delta_t=1: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12] -> 0 not in.\n      delta_t=0: [-83, -48] -> 0 not in.\n      delta_t=3: [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So freeway6 is unsafe only at delta_t=2 (turn 24+2=26).\n\nFreeway7 (and 8): \n  car: [-95 + 48*delta_t, -48 + 48*delta_t]\n  Condition: -95 + 48*delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 48*delta_t\n  => \n    -95 + 48*delta_t <=0 -> 48*delta_t <=95 -> delta_t <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> so delta_t <=1\n    and 0 <= -48+48*delta_t -> 48*delta_t>=48 -> delta_t>=1.\n\n  So only delta_t=1? \n    Check: \n      delta_t=1: [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] -> 0 is included? yes (right endpoint).\n      delta_t=0: [-95,-48] -> 0 not in.\n      delta_t=2: [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So freeway7 and 8 are unsafe at delta_t=1 (turn 24+1=25).\n\nSummary of unsafe (turn, freeway) pairs:\n\nfreeway1: never unsafe (for T>=24)\nfreeway2,3,4,5: unsafe at turns 32 and 33 (i.e., when delta_t=8 and 9)\nfreeway6: unsafe at turn 26 (delta_t=2)\nfreeway7,8: unsafe at turn 25 (delta_t=1)\n\nNote: the unsafe condition is only when the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe start at turn 24 at y=0 (safe). We can choose actions: U (to go to y=1 at turn 25) or S (stay at y=0) or D (but D from 0 would stay at 0? because we cannot go below 0). Actually, the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + delta_y, but clamped to [0,9]. Since we are at 0, D would give -1 -> but then clamped to 0? The problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 0 and choose D, we stay at 0.\n\nSo from (24,0): we can choose S (stay at 0) or U (go to 1) or D (but that would also stay at 0). So effectively: S or U.\n\nWe want to get to 9 as fast as possible, so we prefer U. But let's check:\n\nIf we choose U at turn 24: \n  Then at turn 24, we are at y=0 (safe). \n  Then we move to y=1 at turn 25.\n\nAt turn 25: we are at y=1. Now, freeway1 is safe at all times (as we saw), so turn25 at y=1 is safe? \n  But wait: freeway1 is at y=1. And we just computed that freeway1 is safe at all turns. So yes.\n\nBut note: we also have freeway7 and 8 unsafe at turn25? But we are on freeway1, not 7 or 8. So we are safe.\n\nThen at turn25 we are at y=1. Then we can choose to move up again: to y=2 at turn26.\n\nAt turn26: we are at y=2. Now, freeway2 is unsafe only at turns32 and 33, so turn26 is safe? \n  However, note freeway6 is unsafe at turn26? But we are on freeway2, not freeway6. So safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway2 at turn26? We said it's safe at turn26? because the unsafe for freeway2 is at turns32 and 33. \n\nBut note: we must check each freeway independently: the unsafe condition is only for the freeway we are on.\n\nSo if we are at freeway2 at turn26, we check freeway2: at turn26 (delta_t=2) for freeway2: \n  car: [-59+6*2, -48+6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> 0 is not in [-47,-36]? (since -36<0) -> no. \nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can continue moving up? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeways 7 and 8 at turn25? but we are not on them.\n\nAnd freeway6 at turn26: we are not on it (we are on freeway2 at turn26).\n\nSo if we go up every turn, we will be:\n\nTurn24: y0 -> choose U -> turn25: y1 (safe: freeway1 safe at turn25)\nTurn25: at y1, choose U -> turn26: y2 (safe: freeway2 at turn26: safe as computed above)\nTurn26: at y2, choose U -> turn27: y3 (freeway3: at turn27, delta_t=3 -> [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> 0 not in -> safe)\nTurn27: at y3, choose U -> turn28: y4 (freeway4: same as freeway2: at turn28, delta_t=4 -> [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe)\nTurn28: at y4, choose U -> turn29: y5 (freeway5: same, at turn29, delta_t=5 -> [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> safe)\nTurn29: at y5, choose U -> turn30: y6 (freeway6: at turn30, delta_t=6 -> but freeway6 unsafe only at turn26? \n  For freeway6: unsafe only at delta_t=2 -> turn26. So at turn30: [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe)\nTurn30: at y6, choose U -> turn31: y7 (freeway7: at turn31, delta_t=7 -> for freeway7: unsafe only at turn25? \n  At turn31: [-95+48*7, -48+48*7] = [-95+336, -48+336] = [241, 288] -> safe)\nTurn31: at y7, choose U -> turn32: y8 (freeway8: at turn32, delta_t=8 -> for freeway8: unsafe only at turn25? \n  At turn32: [-95+48*8, -48+48*8] = [-95+384, -48+384] = [289,336] -> safe)\nTurn32: at y8, choose U -> turn33: y9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence: 9 moves of U.\n\nBut wait: at turn32, we are at y8 (freeway8) and then we choose U to go to y9 at turn33.\n\nBut note: at turn32, we are at y8 (freeway8) and we must check freeway8 at turn32: we just computed it's safe.\n\nHowever, we have a problem: freeway2,3,4,5 are unsafe at turns32 and 33? But we are not on freeway2,3,4,5 at turn32 or 33. We are on freeway8 at turn32 and then at turn33 we are at y9 (which is not a freeway) so no check.\n\nBut what about the move from y7 to y8 at turn31? \n  At turn31: we are at y7 (freeway7) and then we choose U -> then at turn32 we will be at y8.\n  At turn31: we check freeway7 at turn31: which we computed as safe.\n\nSo the entire sequence: \n  Turn24: U -> y=1 at turn25\n  Turn25: U -> y=2 at turn26\n  Turn26: U -> y=3 at turn27\n  Turn27: U -> y=4 at turn28\n  Turn28: U -> y=5 at turn29\n  Turn29: U -> y=6 at turn30\n  Turn30: U -> y=7 at turn31\n  Turn31: U -> y=8 at turn32\n  Turn32: U -> y=9 at turn33\n\nTotal turns: from turn24 to turn33 -> 10 turns? Actually, we take 9 actions (from turn24 to turn32 inclusive) and then at turn33 we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence of actions is for turns starting at t1=24 until the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn we are at y9.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turns: 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. That's 9 actions.\n\nBut let me verify the unsafe conditions we might have missed:\n\nAt turn25: we are at y1 -> freeway1: safe (always)\nAt turn26: we are at y2 -> freeway2: at delta_t=2: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAt turn27: y3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2 at delta_t=3: [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\nAt turn28: y4 -> freeway4: same at delta_t=4: [-35,-24] -> safe.\nAt turn29: y5 -> freeway5: same at delta_t=5: [-29,-18] -> safe.\nAt turn30: y6 -> freeway6: at delta_t=6: [133,168] -> safe.\nAt turn31: y7 -> freeway7: at delta_t=7: [241,288] -> safe.\nAt turn32: y8 -> freeway8: at delta_t=8: [289,336] -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the freeways 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at turns32 and 33? But we are not on any of these at turn32 (we are on freeway8) and at turn33 we are at y9 (not a freeway). So no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can do 9 consecutive U moves.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\". Since we must go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 moves (each move up increases by 1). So 9 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\n\nBut wait: we start at turn24 at y0. Then after the first U (at turn24) we are at turn25 at y1. Then at turn32 we do the last U and then at turn33 we are at y9.\n\nSo the actions are from turn24 to turn32 (9 actions).\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1, so H actions? and then we are at the goal at the next turn? \n\nActually, the state after H actions: we have taken H actions, so we are at turn t1 + H, and we are at y9.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (24) at state (0,0). Then we take action a_{24} at turn24. Then at turn25 we are at y1. ... Then at turn24+H we are at y9.\n\nWe require that at turn24+H we are at y9. \n\nThe minimal H: we have to go from 0 to 9: at least 9 moves. And with the above, we can do it in 9 moves.\n\nBut note: we must avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe. The above path avoids all unsafe moments.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe turn for freeway2: at turn32 (which is 24+8) and turn33 (24+9). At turn32, we are at y8 (freeway8) and then at turn33 we are at y9. So we are not on freeway2 at turn32 or 33. Similarly, we are not on freeway2 at any turn? We were on freeway2 at turn26, which was safe.\n\nSo it seems the direct path is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway7 at turn25? We are at freeway1 at turn25, not freeway7. So safe.\n\nSo the answer is 9 moves of U.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". We have H=9.\n\nBut let me write the sequence:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\n\nBut wait: at turn32, after the U, we go to y9 at turn33. So we have taken 9 actions and reached at turn33.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then it says \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nSo at the end of the sequence, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y9.\n\nIn our plan: \n  We start at turn24: y0.\n  After action at turn24: at turn25 we are at y1.\n  ...\n  After action at turn32: at turn33 we are at y9.\n\nSo the turn when we are at y9 is turn33 = t1 + 9 = 24+9 = 33. So H-1=9? Then H=10? \n\nBut wait: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. So the actions are taken at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a bit confusing. \n\nThe problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nNote: the index: \n  t=0: a_{t1+0} -> action at turn t1 (24)\n  t=1: a_{t1+1} -> action at turn 25\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after the last action? \n\nThe state update: after taking action a_t at turn t, we get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we get the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y9? \n\nThat would be inconsistent because the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at the next state at turn t1+H.\n\nAlternatively, it might be that the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is what matters? But the problem says \"y_{t_1+H-1}\" meaning the y at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn t1, which updates the state to turn t1+1.\n\nSo the state at turn t1 is given. Then after the action at turn t1, we are at turn t1+1.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1 is (0,0). The state at turn t1+1 is the result of the first action.\n\nSo to be at y9 at turn t1+H-1, that would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nThe problem says: we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn we take an action) the y is 9? But at the beginning of that turn we are at some y, then we take an action and then we are at the next state.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement is that at the turn after the last action we are at y9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nI think there is a confusion in indexing.\n\nLooking back: \n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, we output actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nBut the condition is: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThis implies that at the turn t1+H-1, we are at y9. But that would be at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we have not taken the action of that turn. \n\nSo if we are at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1: which corresponds to turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are already at y9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take the last action? \n\nBut the problem says we take H actions. \n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be that at the end of the sequence, after the last action, we are at y9. \n\nBut the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we would require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there might be a misindexing.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the sequence is for actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action? But the sequence requires an action for that turn.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended meaning is that after taking the sequence of H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1), the player is at y9 at the next turn, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is updated at the same turn? \n\nBut the dynamics: \n  \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\"\n\nSo the state at time t+1 is updated from the state at time t and the action at time t.\n\nTherefore, the state at time t is the state before the action at time t.\n\nSo if we require y_{t1+H-1}=9, that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are already at y9. Then we would take an action at turn t1+H-1, but we are already at y9? and then we might move away? \n\nThat doesn't make sense for the goal.\n\nI think it's more reasonable that we require the state at the end of the last action to be y9, i.e., at turn t1+H we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nAlternatively, note that the sequence of actions is of length H, and we start at t1. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is the result. So the minimal H would be the minimal number of actions to reach y9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nI see the confusion. The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but then the sequence is for H actions? and then we are at the goal at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut that would imply that we are at the goal at the same turn as the last action? \n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nThis suggests that after taking the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 (which is H-1 actions? because t=0 to H-2) we are at turn t1+H-1 and at y9? \n\nBut the indexing: t=0,...,H-1: that's H actions. \n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe state after the action at turn t1 is at turn t1+1.\n\nAfter the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we are at y9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nTo resolve, let me assume that the problem means that at the turn when we take the last action, we are already at y9? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the problem considers the state at the end of the turn? \n\nBut the update rule clearly states: y_{t+1} = ... so the state at time t+1 is after the action at time t.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem? There is no example.\n\nBut note: the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1. Then we take an action at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we are at a new y.\n\nSo to be at y9, we must have taken at least 9 up moves.\n\nThe first time we can be at y9 is at turn t1+9.\n\nBut at the beginning of turn t1+9, we are at y? which is the result of the action at turn t1+8.\n\nSo if we do 9 up moves, then at turn24+9=33 we are at y9.\n\nSo the state at turn33 is (0,9). \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 = 24+H-1 we are at y9.\n\nSo 24+H-1 = 33 -> H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\nBut then we would be at y9 at turn33 = t1+9, which is also t1+H-1? because H=10 -> t1+H-1=24+9=33.\n\nBut then what is the sequence? We take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 = 24 to 33? that's 10 actions.\n\nBut then at the last action (turn33) we are at y9? and then we take an action? which might move us? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of turns H might mean the number of turns we have to wait? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of H actions.\n\nBut if we are at y9 at turn33 (t1+9) then we have taken 9 actions (from turn24 to turn32). Then H=9.\n\nAnd then at turn33 we are at y9, which is the goal.\n\nBut the problem requires: y_{t1+H-1} = y_{24+9-1}=y_{32} = 9? \n\nBut at turn32 we are at y8 (if we did 8 moves) and then we take the 9th action at turn32 to go to y9 at turn33. So at turn32 we are at y8, not y9.\n\nTherefore, the requirement y_{t1+H-1}=9 is not satisfied.\n\nSo we must be at y9 at turn32.\n\nThat means we must get to y9 in 8 moves? But that's impossible: from 0 to 9 in 8 moves? minimum 9 moves.\n\nSo there is a contradiction.\n\nUnless we can move faster? The moves are only +1, -1, 0 per action. So we need at least 9 up moves.\n\nTherefore, the problem must mean that at turn t1+H we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nI think there is a typo in the problem. Probably, it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBecause otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nOr perhaps the indexing of turns: maybe the initial turn is not counted? \n\nLet me read carefully: \"current turn is t1\" and \"initial position (0,y_{t1})\" so at turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=0.\n\nThen we take actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ... and after H actions, we are at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nThen the requirement should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nGiven the impossibility, and that the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", it might be that H is the number of turns that pass, not the number of actions.\n\nFor example, from turn24 to turn33, there are 9 turns that pass (24,25,...,32) and then at turn33 we are there, so H=9 turns? but then the number of actions is also 9.\n\nAnd then the requirement: y_{t1+H-1}=y_{24+9-1}=y_{32}=? but we are at y9 at turn33, not turn32.\n\nAlternatively, H is the number of actions, and then the state at the next turn is y9, and the problem has a typo.\n\nGiven the standard in such problems, I think it's likely a typo and it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut to be safe, let me assume that the problem means that we must be at y9 at the turn when we take the last action? But that is at the beginning of the turn? which is not updated by the action.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y9. Then we take an action (which might move us away) and then we are at a new state. That doesn't make sense for the goal.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended meaning is that after the last action, we are at y9, i.e., at turn t1+H we are at y9.\n\nAnd the minimal H is 9.\n\nAnd the sequence is 9 actions of U.\n\nAnd in the answer format, we output the actions for turns 24 to 32.\n\nAnd then at turn33 we are at y9.\n\nAnd the problem might have a typo in the requirement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that the goal is to be at y9 at the turn of the last action, meaning after the action? \n\nBut the update rule is clear: the action at turn t updates the state to turn t+1.\n\nSo I will go with H=9 actions.\n\nAnd output the sequence.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there is a faster way? We need 9 up moves, so no.\n\nOr if we can do it in 9 actions without being hit? we already checked.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster by not moving sometimes? that would only take more turns.\n\nSo 9 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=9.\n\nBut in the box, we only output the actions.\n\nSo the above.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"determine H\", but the answer format only requires the actions. So we output the actions.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut to be extra safe, let me check if at any point we are on a freeway at an unsafe turn.\n\nWe already did:\n\nAt turn25: y1 -> freeway1: safe.\nAt turn26: y2 -> freeway2: at turn26 (delta_t=2) -> [-47,-36] -> safe.\nAt turn27: y3 -> freeway3: at turn27 (delta_t=3) -> [-41,-30] -> safe.\nAt turn28: y4 -> freeway4: at turn28 (delta_t=4) -> [-35,-24] -> safe.\nAt turn29: y5 -> freeway5: at turn29 (delta_t=5) -> [-29,-18] -> safe.\nAt turn30: y6 -> freeway6: at turn30 (delta_t=6) -> [133,168] -> safe.\nAt turn31: y7 -> freeway7: at turn31 (delta_t=7) -> [241,288] -> safe.\nAt turn32: y8 -> freeway8: at turn32 (delta_t=8) -> [289,336] -> safe.\n\nAnd we never are on any freeway at the unsafe turns: \n  freeway2 unsafe at turns32 and 33: we are on freeway8 at turn32 and then at turn33 we are at y9 (not a freeway). \n  freeway6 unsafe at turn26: we are on freeway2 at turn26, not freeway6.\n  freeway7 and 8 unsafe at turn25: we are on freeway1 at turn25.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 24 in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. The minimal number of turns required is 9, as the player must move up 9 times to go from y = 0 to y = 9. The sequence of actions is determined to be safe based on the car positions and collision rules.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: The car is at [37, 48] at turn 24, moving right at speed 12. For any turn \\( T \\geq 24 \\), the car's span is \\([37 + 12 \\Delta t, 48 + 12 \\Delta t]\\), where \\(\\Delta t = T - 24\\). Since 37 > 0 and the car moves right, 0 is never in the span. Thus, freeway 1 is always safe.\n- **Freeways 2-5 (y=2,3,4,5)**: Each car is at \\([-59, -48]\\) at turn 24, moving right at speed 6. The span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([-59 + 6 \\Delta t, -48 + 6 \\Delta t]\\). The car covers 0 when \\(8 \\leq \\Delta t \\leq 9\\) (turns 32 and 33). At other times, it is safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: The car is at \\([-83, -48]\\) at turn 24, moving right at speed 36. The span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([-83 + 36 \\Delta t, -48 + 36 \\Delta t]\\). The car covers 0 only at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) (turn 26). At other times, it is safe.\n- **Freeways 7-8 (y=7,8)**: Each car is at \\([-95, -48]\\) at turn 24, moving right at speed 48. The span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([-95 + 48 \\Delta t, -48 + 48 \\Delta t]\\). The car covers 0 only at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) (turn 25). At other times, it is safe.\n\n### Path Validation:\nThe player starts at (0, 0) at turn 24. The sequence of 9 \"U\" (up) actions is:\n- **Turn 24**: Move to y=1 at turn 25. Collision check at turn 25 on y=1: safe (freeway 1 always safe).\n- **Turn 25**: Move to y=2 at turn 26. Collision check at turn 25 on y=1: safe. At turn 26 on y=2: car span is \\([-47, -36]\\) (0 not in span), safe.\n- **Turn 26**: Move to y=3 at turn 27. Collision check at turn 26 on y=2: safe. At turn 27 on y=3: car span is \\([-41, -30]\\) (0 not in span), safe.\n- **Turn 27**: Move to y=4 at turn 28. Collision check at turn 27 on y=3: safe. At turn 28 on y=4: car span is \\([-35, -24]\\) (0 not in span), safe.\n- **Turn 28**: Move to y=5 at turn 29. Collision check at turn 28 on y=4: safe. At turn 29 on y=5: car span is \\([-29, -18]\\) (0 not in span), safe.\n- **Turn 29**: Move to y=6 at turn 30. Collision check at turn 29 on y=5: safe. At turn 30 on y=6: car span is \\([133, 168]\\) (0 not in span), safe.\n- **Turn 30**: Move to y=7 at turn 31. Collision check at turn 30 on y=6: safe. At turn 31 on y=7: car span is \\([241, 288]\\) (0 not in span), safe.\n- **Turn 31**: Move to y=8 at turn 32. Collision check at turn 31 on y=7: safe. At turn 32 on y=8: car span is \\([289, 336]\\) (0 not in span), safe.\n- **Turn 32**: Move to y=9 at turn 33. Collision check at turn 32 on y=8: safe. y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nThe player reaches (0, 9) at turn 33. This path avoids all unsafe freeway-turn combinations. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, as fewer moves (e.g., 8) cannot increase y from 0 to 9.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 24 to 32 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U\n}",

Let me see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)] but since it's moving left, head and tail decrease.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, for left-moving, if it's moving left, and head is at h, which is the front, so if moving left, front should be smaller number.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut if it's moving left, and h is head, τ is tail, then for left-moving, head is left, so if at t1, position x, head is at h, which is smaller than tail? No.\n\nI think I need to interpret the span.\n\nIt says: for car k, head h, tail τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: at time t1, span is [h, τ], meaning from h to τ, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so [τ, h] means τ is left end, h is right end, I think.\n\nIn the text: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, the span is from τ to h, with τ ≤ h, I assume, and it moves right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], but if it's moving left, and [h, τ], with h and τ, probably h is the left end or right end?\n\nIt says: \"left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, and [h, τ] is the span, with h and τ, but in the update, both decrease, so if it's moving left, the left end should be smaller, so perhaps for left-moving, h is the left end, and τ is the right end? But the notation says \"head h, tail τ\", so for left-moving, head is the front, which is left, so h is left, τ is right, so span is from h to τ, with h < τ, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is right, tail is left, so span from τ to h, τ < h.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nSo at t1, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But in the text, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] which is [tail, head], so yes, from τ to h.\n\nIn this case, tail = -47, head = -36, so span at t1 is [-47, -36].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if there was, Span(t1) = [h, τ], from head to tail.\n\nBut here all are right-moving except I need to check.\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, I think, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) so tail -47, head -36, direction right.\n\nFreeway 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) similarly, tail -41, head -30.\n\nAll are right-moving with various speeds.\n\nFreeway 6: (60, 25, right, 36) head 60, tail 25, so span [25,60] at t1? Tail is 25, head is 60, so since right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [25,60].\n\nBut tail should be left, head right, so [25,60] yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (96,49,right,48) head 96, tail 49, span [49,96]\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: at t1=27, span [-47, -36], speed 12, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span [ -47 + 12*(T-27), -36 + 12*(T-27) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T if 0 is in the span of the car on k at time T.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, but in this case, each freeway has only one car listed, I think only one car per freeway, from the table.\n\nThe table says \"Cars\" but it lists one tuple per freeway, so probably one car per freeway.\n\nSo for each freeway, there is one car.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9, so I need to increase y by 6. Since I can move up, down, or stay, to minimize turns, I should always move up when possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nI start at y=3 at t=27.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, which determines y for the next turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I need that at time t, for freeway y_t, 0 is not in the car's span at time t.\n\nIf I am at y_t, and y_t is between 1 and 8, I need to avoid collision with car on that freeway at that time.\n\nIf y_t=0 or 9, no car, so no issue.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCurrently at t=27, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, so when I am at y=9, no car.\n\nSimilarly, y=0.\n\nBut I start from y=3, need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I need to go up, and minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I have to stay safe at each position when I am on freeways.\n\nNow, let me find for each freeway and each time, whether position 0 is covered by the car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and time T, is 0 in the span of car on k at time T.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at time T.\n\nBut since I might stay or move, I need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's define ΔT = T - 27, so at time T = 27 + ΔT.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: right, s=12, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T, span: [ -47 + 12 ΔT, -36 + 12 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12 ΔT\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-30,-41,right,6) tail -41, head -30? Head -30, tail -41, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nDirection right, s=6.\n\nAt T, [ -41 + 6 ΔT, -30 + 6 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 6 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6 ΔT\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-30,-41,right,6) so identical to freeway 2? No, freeway 2 is (-30,-41,right,6), but head and tail, tail is -41, head -30, so same as above.\n\nBut it's for different freeway, but since the car is the same, the unsafe times are the same for freeway 2 and 3? No, freeway 2 and 3 are different freeways, but the car parameters are the same, so for each, the span and unsafe times are identical.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 and 5 same.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 all have (-30,-41,right,6), so same car parameters, so for each, at time T, span is [ -41 + 6 ΔT, -30 + 6 ΔT ], so unsafe when 0 in that interval.\n\nSimilarly freeway 1 different.\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36) head 60, tail 25, direction right, s=36.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [25, 60]\n\nAt T, [25 + 36 ΔT, 60 + 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 25 + 36 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 36 ΔT\n\nBut 25 + 36 ΔT is always positive for ΔT >=0, since 25>0, so 0 cannot be in [25+36ΔT, 60+36ΔT] because left end is positive, so never unsafe for freeway 6? Let's see.\n\nAt ΔT=0, span [25,60], 0 not in, and as ΔT increases, both increase, so always positive, so 0 never in span. So freeway 6 is always safe? But we need to check collision only when we are on it, but since 0 never covered, it is always safe to be on freeway 6 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (96,49,right,48) head 96, tail 49, s=48\n\nSpan at t1: [49,96]\n\nAt T: [49 + 48 ΔT, 96 + 48 ΔT], always positive, so 0 never in span. Always safe.\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7, always safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have high speeds, but since they start at x=49 and 96, moving right, position 0 is never covered, so yes, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 1: with s=12, span at T: [ -47 + 12 ΔT, -36 + 12 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <= 3 since integer.\n\nΔT is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nT and t1 integers, ΔT integer.\n\n-47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 = 3 + 11/12, so ΔT <= 3\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT => 12 ΔT >= 36 => ΔT >= 3\n\nSo for ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3, so ΔT=3\n\nWhen ΔT=3, -47 + 12*3 = -47 + 36 = -11 <=0\n\n-36 + 12*3 = -36 + 36 =0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true.\n\n0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT, at ΔT=3, -36+36=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nAnd -47+36= -11 <=0 true.\n\nSo at ΔT=3, T=30, 0 is in span.\n\nFor other ΔT, not.\n\nΔT=2: -47+24= -23 <=0, -36+24= -12 <=0, but 0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not.\n\nΔT=4: -47+48=1 >0, so -47+12ΔT=1>0, not <=0, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, only at ΔT=3, T=30, unsafe for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2,3,4,5 all same: span [ -41 + 6 ΔT, -30 + 6 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= -30 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst, -41 + 6 ΔT <=0 => 6 ΔT <=41 => ΔT <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so ΔT <=6\n\nSecond, 0 <= -30 + 6 ΔT => 6 ΔT >=30 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo for ΔT from 5 to 6 inclusive.\n\nΔT=5: -41 +30 = -11 <=0, -30+30=0 <=0? 0<=0 true.\n\nΔT=6: -41+36= -5 <=0, -30+36=6, 0<=6 true.\n\nΔT=4: -41+24= -17 <=0, but 0 <= -30+24= -6? 0<= -6 false.\n\nΔT=7: -41+42=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=5 and 6, T=32 and 33? ΔT=5: T=27+5=32, ΔT=6: T=33.\n\nt1=27, ΔT=T-t1, so T=27+ΔT.\n\nΔT=5: T=32, ΔT=6: T=33.\n\nNow freeway 6,7,8 always safe, as established.\n\nFreeway 6: span always positive, so safe.\n\nSimilarly 7 and 8.\n\nBut freeway 1 unsafe only at T=30.\n\nFreeways 2-5 unsafe at T=32 and 33.\n\nNow, I start at t=27, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 6 steps up.\n\nIf I move up every turn, I can reach in 6 turns: from t=27 to t=32, actions U,U,U,U,U,U, then at t=33, y=9.\n\nBut let's see the positions and times.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAt t=27, y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=27, y_{28} depends on a_{27}.\n\nI need to define the state.\n\nAt the start of turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nDuring turn t, I am on freeway y_t, so I need to be safe at time t on freeway y_t.\n\nThen at next turn, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach a state where at some turn, y_t =9, and I can stop, but since I need to be at y=9, and the turn when I am at y=9, I don't care about car, since no car at y=9.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nFor that turn, since y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I start at t=27, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways I need to pass are y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=3 is also a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 has a car, which is freeway 3? Freeway k=1 to 8, each with a car.\n\nIn the table, freeway k=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer at y=3, so freeway 3.\n\nAt t=27, I am on freeway 3, so I need to check if safe at t=27 for freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has the car with parameters (-30,-41,right,6), same as 2,4,5.\n\nAt t=27, ΔT=0, span [ -41 +0, -30 +0] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, since -30<0? -30 is negative, so 0 not in [-41,-30], so safe. Yes.\n\nNow, I can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should move up.\n\nBut I have to avoid unsafe times on each freeway.\n\nThe unsafe times are:\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1): unsafe only at t=30\n\nFor freeway 2 (y=2): unsafe at t=32 and t=33\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same as y=2, unsafe at t=32,33\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): same, unsafe t=32,33\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same, unsafe t=32,33\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): always safe\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): always safe\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): always safe\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at t=27.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is above, so to reach y=9, I must be at y=8 at some turn, then move up to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8, I need to come from below.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, I can be on them at any time without issue.\n\nThe only dangers are on y=1 to 5, but specifically at certain times.\n\ny=1 is only unsafe at t=30.\n\ny=2 to 5 unsafe at t=32 and 33.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nIf I move up every turn:\n\nStart t=27, y=3, safe as above.\n\nAction a27: U, so y28 = y27 +1 =4\n\nAt t=28, I am at y=4\n\nFreeway 4, is it safe at t=28?\n\nt=28, ΔT=1, for freeway 4, which is same as 2,3,4,5.\n\nAt ΔT=1, span [ -41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35, -24], 0 not in, since both negative, so safe.\n\nAction a28: U, y29=5\n\nt=29, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt t=29, ΔT=2, span [ -41 +12, -30 +12]? s=6, ΔT=2, -41 +12= -29? -41 + 6*2 = -41+12= -29, -30+12= -18, so [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a29: U, y30=6\n\nt=30, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 is always safe, as we said.\n\nAt t=30, is freeway 6 safe? Yes, always.\n\nBut t=30 is when freeway 1 is unsafe, but I am on y=6, not y=1, so no problem.\n\nAction a30: U, y31=7\n\nt=31, y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nAction a31: U, y32=8\n\nt=32, y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nAction a32: U, y33=9\n\nt=33, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, at t=32, y=8, safe.\n\nt=33, y=9, no issue.\n\nBut t=32 and t=33 are unsafe for freeways 2-5, but I am not on them at those times.\n\nAt t=32, I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly t=33, y=9.\n\nSo this sequence seems safe: actions U,U,U,U,U,U from t=27 to t=32, reaching y=9 at t=33.\n\nt=27: action, y28=4\n\nt=28: action, y29=5\n\nt=29: action, y30=6\n\nt=30: action, y31=7\n\nt=31: action, y32=8\n\nt=32: action, y33=9\n\nSo at turn t=33, y=9.\n\nH=6 turns? From t=27 to t=32, that's 6 actions: t=27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at t=33, y=9.\n\nt=27: start, after action a27, at t=28 y=4\n\n...\n\nAfter a32, at t=33 y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions at t=27 to t=32.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t=33, which is after H actions, H=6.\n\nMinimal should be 6, since we need to increase by 6.\n\nBut is there a problem? At t=32, y=8, but freeways 2-5 are unsafe at t=32 and 33, but I am not on them.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=3 at t=27, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=28, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=29, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=30, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=31, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=32, safe.\n\ny=9 at t=33, done.\n\nAll seem safe.\n\nBut at t=30, freeway 1 is unsafe, but I am on y=6, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=32, freeway 2-5 unsafe, but I am on y=8.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, with H=6, I can reach.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,3) at turn t_1=27, and we need to output actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=6, actions at t=27 to 32.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nPerhaps I can do it faster? But to go from 3 to 9, minimum 6 steps up, so 6 actions are needed, since each up increases by 1, and no down or stay would help to reduce turns, it would only increase, so 6 is minimal.\n\nBut can I reach earlier? Start at t=27 y=3, after 5 actions: at t=32, y=3+5=8, then at t=33 y=9 with sixth action.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{27+k} = 3 + number of ups minus downs.\n\nTo reach y=9, need net +6, so minimum 6 actions if all up.\n\nIf I do downs or stay, it takes more actions, so 6 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence above should work.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=32, I am at y=8, which is freeway 8, always safe.\n\nt=33 y=9.\n\nBut t=33 is when freeways 2-5 are unsafe, but I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 3 at t=27: safe, as before.\n\nt=28 y=4, freeway 4: t=28, ΔT=1, span for y=4 car: [ -41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nt=29 y=5, freeway 5: t=29, ΔT=2, span [ -41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nt=30 y=6, freeway 6: always safe, span at t=30, ΔT=3, [25 +36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108,60+108]=[133,168], not 0.\n\nt=31 y=7, freeway 7: [49+48*4? ΔT= T-27, t=31, ΔT=4, [49+48*4,96+48*4]= [49+192,96+192]=[241,288], not 0.\n\nt=32 y=8, similar.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I used only U, but I need to specify for each turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} (which is U)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1+5} (U)\n\nThen at turn t_1+6, y=9, but we don't need action for that turn since we are already there.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, with H=6, so t=27 to 32.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe car on freeway 1 is unsafe at t=30, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I can be faster, but I can't.\n\nMaybe I can stay or something to avoid, but in this case no need.\n\nAnother thing: at t=33, when I reach y=9, but t=33 is unsafe for y=2-5, but I am not there.\n\nBut y=3 is where I started, but at t=33, if someone is there, but I am not.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the position at each turn.\n\nStart: t=27, y=3\n\nAfter a27=U, t=28, y=4\n\na28=U, t=29, y=5\n\na29=U, t=30, y=6\n\na30=U, t=31, y=7\n\na31=U, t=32, y=8\n\na32=U, t=33, y=9\n\nAt each of these turns, when I am on a freeway, it is safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nt=27: y=3, freeway 3, safe as above\n\nt=28: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nt=29: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nt=30: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=31: y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nt=32: y=8, freeway 8, safe\n\nt=33: y=9, no freeway\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 3 has a car, but at t=27 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6,7,8, we have cars, but since they never cover 0, it is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 6: car at t=27: head 60, tail 25, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=30: as above, [133,168], not 0.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and we did.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nH=6.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nThe initial position is (0,y_{t1}) at turn t1, which is given.\n\nIn the sequence, we output actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=27, H=6, so turns 27 to 32.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? For example, if I stay at some point, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nOr if I move down, but that would make it longer to reach y=9, so no benefit.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at some point I need to avoid, but in this case, no conflict.\n\nFor example, at t=30, if I were on y=1, it would be unsafe, but I am on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=32, if on y=2-5, unsafe, but I am on y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in fewer turns by being on freeway when safe, but since I need to move, minimum 6 steps.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1, -1, 0 per turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has (60,25,right,36), but tail 25, head 60, which is tail left, head right, so [25,60], but 25<60, so moving right, positions increasing.\n\nAt t=27, [25,60], all positive, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head and tail.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: head -36, tail -47, so if tail is -47, head -36, and direction right, so tail left, head right, so span [ -47, -36], both negative, so 0 not covered except at t=30.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6, with all up actions.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut the player position: at turn t=27, position (0,3), so on freeway 3.\n\nAfter actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 27: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAnd since H=6, we have turns 27 to 32.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 27 + 6 -1 = 32, yes.\n\nAnd y at turn 33 is 9.\n\nBut turn 33 is not in the action sequence, since we reach after last action.\n\nThe action at turn t determines the move for that turn, leading to position at t+1.\n\nAnd at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0, y_{t1})\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position (0, y_{t1+1})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, at turn t1 + H, position (0,9)\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nWe perform action a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 33, y=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach is t1 + H.\n\nBut the actions are from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions from t=27 to 32, at t=33 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can think H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nIt says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1 +0 to t1 + H-1.\n\nSo for H=6, actions at t1 to t1+5, which is 27 to 32.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t1+0 to t1+H-1.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, all U.\n\nBut in the output, I think that's it.\n\nBut let me see if for freeway 3 at t=27, is it safe? We said yes.\n\nBut just to be paranoid, suppose at t=27, ΔT=0, freeway 3 car: span [-41,-30], which is from -41 to -30, all negative, so x=0 not in, since 0 > -30, and -30 <0? -30 is less than 0, but the interval is [-41,-30], so numbers from -41 to -30 inclusive, all less than or equal to -30 <0, so 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 27\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Unsafe Times\n- **Freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\))**: Car with initial span \\([-47, -36]\\) at \\(t = 27\\), moving right at speed 12.  \n  - Span at time \\(T\\): \\([-47 + 12(T-27), -36 + 12(T-27)]\\).  \n  - Collision occurs at \\(T\\) if \\(0\\) is in the span:  \n    \\(-47 + 12(T-27) \\leq 0 \\leq -36 + 12(T-27)\\).  \n    Solving: \\(T = 30\\) (only unsafe turn).  \n- **Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5 (\\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\))**: Cars with initial span \\([-41, -30]\\) at \\(t = 27\\), moving right at speed 6.  \n  - Span at time \\(T\\): \\([-41 + 6(T-27), -30 + 6(T-27)]\\).  \n  - Collision occurs at \\(T\\) if \\(0\\) is in the span:  \n    \\(-41 + 6(T-27) \\leq 0 \\leq -30 + 6(T-27)\\).  \n    Solving: \\(T = 32\\) and \\(T = 33\\) (unsafe turns).  \n- **Freeway 6 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Car with initial span \\([25, 60]\\) at \\(t = 27\\), moving right at speed 36.  \n  - Span at time \\(T\\): \\([25 + 36(T-27), 60 + 36(T-27)]\\).  \n  - Since the left end is always positive for \\(T \\geq 27\\), \\(0\\) is never in the span (always safe).  \n- **Freeways 7 and 8 (\\(y = 7, 8\\))**: Cars with initial span \\([49, 96]\\) at \\(t = 27\\), moving right at speed 48.  \n  - Span at time \\(T\\): \\([49 + 48(T-27), 96 + 48(T-27)]\\).  \n  - Since the left end is always positive for \\(T \\geq 27\\), \\(0\\) is never in the span (always safe).  \n\nSummary of unsafe turns:\n- \\(y = 1\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 30\\).\n- \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 32\\) and \\(T = 33\\).\n- \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\): Always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9)\n- The player starts at (0, 3) at turn 27.\n- To reach (0, 9), the player must increase \\(y\\) by 6, requiring at least 6 \"up\" (U) actions, as each U increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no other action reduces the number of turns.\n- The sequence of all U actions is feasible, as it avoids all unsafe turns on the relevant freeways:\n  - At \\(T = 27\\): \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe as \\(T = 27\\) is not unsafe for \\(y = 3\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 28\\): \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe as \\(T = 28\\) is not unsafe for \\(y = 4\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 29\\): \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe as \\(T = 29\\) is not unsafe for \\(y = 5\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 30\\): \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, always safe, and \\(T = 30\\) is unsafe for \\(y = 1\\) but not relevant).\n  - At \\(T = 31\\): \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, always safe).\n  - At \\(T = 32\\): \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, always safe, and \\(T = 32\\) is unsafe for \\(y = 2-5\\) but not relevant).\n- After the 6th action (at turn 32), the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 33.\n\n### Minimal \\(H\\) and Action Sequence\n- Minimal \\(H = 6\\) (number of actions from turn 27 to 32).\n- Action sequence: All U actions for turns 27 to 32.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 27: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 30 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, so I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The cars are defined at turn t₁=30 with their head and tail positions. For right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head], and for left-moving, it's [head, tail], but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\n- Freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37? That seems odd because for a right-moving car, head should be greater than tail, I think. Let me read the update rule.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T−t₁), h + s(T−t₁)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the update, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ tail, h head? I think there might be a inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T−t₁), h + s(T−t₁)]\"\n\nSo for a right-moving car, at t₁, span is [tail, head], so tail ≤ head, and the car extends from tail to head.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12). So head=48, tail=37? But 37 to 48, so tail=37, head=48, so span [37,48] at t=30.\n\nSimilarly, others: freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) — tail=-59, head=-48? Since [τ, h] = [-59, -48] for right-moving.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 same as 2: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36) — tail=-83, head=-48\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48) — tail=-95, head=-48\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nAll are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if, when the player is on freeway y at turn T, and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are not on the new row until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you are only on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for the car on y_{T+1}, you check at T+1, not at T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ span(T) but 0 ∉ span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, when you are at position (0, y_T) at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and you check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen you choose action a_T, which changes y to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn t₁=30. y=0 is not a freeway, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. The goal is to reach (0,9).\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways with cars are y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer at (0,0) at turn 30, which is safe since no cars.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), also safe.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we need to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions on the rows y=1 to 8 at the times we are there.\n\nSince we can only move up, down, or stay, but to minimize time, we should mostly go up, but sometimes wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient, so probably we only go up or stay, unless necessary to go down.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway row, when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each turn T, we need to know if at turn T, on row k, is there a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars per row? In the table, it lists one car per freeway, I think. Let's see the car state.\n\nIt says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" for each freeway, so I think one car per freeway, since it's listed per freeway.\n\nFor freeway 1, one car; freeway 2, one car, etc. So each row has one car.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 each have one car.\n\nNow, for each car, we can compute for which T, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nLet t = T - t₁ = T - 30, so time offset.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T: [τ + s(T-30), h + s(T-30)]\n\nSince it's right-moving, span starts at τ + s(T-30) and ends at h + s(T-30).\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-30) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-30)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nSo for each car, we can solve for T where this inequality holds.\n\nThen, for each row, the times when it is unsafe to be on that row.\n\nWe need to be on row y at turn T only when it is safe for that y at that T.\n\nNow, player movement: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nStart at y=0, turn 30.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn 30 + H, we want y_{30+H} = 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t₁, so actions at time t₁ to t₁ + H-1.\n\nSet τ = t - t₁, so τ=0 at turn 30.\n\nAfter action at τ, we have position at τ+1.\n\nDefine time: let τ be the step, starting from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t=30, position y=0.\n\nWe apply action a_{t₁ + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter applying a_{t₁ + τ}, we move to position at time τ+1.\n\nSo after H actions, we have position at time H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9, where time H corresponds to turn t₁ + H.\n\nPosition at time τ is after τ steps from start.\n\nStart: at τ=0, y_0 = 0, turn 30.\n\nAfter action a_0 at τ=0, we have y_1 at τ=1, turn 31.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1} at τ=H-1, we have y_H at τ=H, turn 30+H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nAnd we need to be safe at each position: for each τ from 0 to H, at time τ, position y_τ, if y_τ is between 1 and 8, then it must be safe, i.e., no car on row y_τ at turn t₁ + τ has 0 in span.\n\nSince t₁ + τ is the turn number.\n\nNow, for τ=0, y=0, safe.\n\nFor τ=H, y=9, safe.\n\nFor τ from 1 to H-1, if y_τ in 1-8, must be safe at turn 30+τ.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of actions, which is also the number of steps in time from 0 to H.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, the minimal H without obstacles would be 9, if we go up every time: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or go down, so H >=9.\n\nWe need to find if we can achieve H=9 or if we need more.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for time offset s = τ, let t = 30 + s.\n\nCar on row k.\n\nFor row 1: car (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12) at t₁=30.\n\nSpan at time t: [τ + speed*(t-30), h + speed*(t-30)] = [37 + 12*(t-30), 48 + 12*(t-30)]\n\nSet u = t - 30, so time offset.\n\nSpan: [37 + 12u, 48 + 12u]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12u <= 0 <= 48 + 12u\n\nBut 37 + 12u <=0 and 0<=48+12u.\n\n48+12u >=0 always for u>=0? u is time offset, t-30, t>=30, u>=0.\n\n37+12u <=0 => 12u <= -37 => u <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, since u>=0, this is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, 48+12u >=0 always true for u>=0.\n\nSo 37+12u <=0 <=48+12u cannot hold since left part false.\n\nThus for row 1, 0 is never in span for t>=30. So row 1 is always safe? Let me check.\n\n37 + 12u <=0 <=48+12u\n\nLeft: 37+12u <=0 => u <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, u>=0, so never true.\n\nRight: 0 <=48+12u always true for u>=0.\n\nSo the inequality 37+12u <=0 <=48+12u requires both, but since left is never true, it's never satisfied. So for all t>=30, 0 not in span for row 1 car. So row 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nIs that right? The car is at [37+12u, 48+12u], which for u=0 is [37,48], not covering 0. As u increases, it moves right, so [37+12u,48+12u], which for u>=0 is at least [37,48], all positive, so indeed, 0 is never covered. So row 1 is always safe.\n\nNow row 2: car (head=-48? Let's see: (head, tail) = (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t₁: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSpeed s=6.\n\nSpan at time t: [τ + s(u), h + s(u)] = [-59 + 6u, -48 + 6u] where u=t-30\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6u <= 0 <= -48 + 6u\n\nSo -59 + 6u <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 6u\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 6u <= 0 => 6u <= 59 => u <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 6u => 6u >= 48 => u >= 8\n\nSo u >=8 and u <=9.833, since u integer (turns are discrete), u=8,9\n\nu=8: -59+48= -11 <=0, 0 <= -48+48=0, yes 0<=0 true\n\nu=9: -59+54= -5 <=0, 0 <= -48+54=6, true\n\nu=10: -59+60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSimilarly, u=7: 0 <= -48+42= -6? 0<= -6 false.\n\nSo for u=8 and u=9, 0 in span, so unsafe at u=8 and u=9, i.e., turns 38 and 39.\n\nu=8: t=30+8=38\n\nu=9: t=39\n\nSimilarly, for row 3: same as row 2? (-48,-59,right,6), identical to row 2.\n\nSo also unsafe at u=8,9, t=38,39.\n\nSimilarly row 4: same, unsafe at u=8,9.\n\nRow 5: same, unsafe at u=8,9.\n\nNow row 6: car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nSpan: [τ + s u, h + s u] = [-83 + 36u, -48 + 36u]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36u <= 0 <= -48 + 36u\n\nFirst: -83 +36u <=0 => 36u <=83 => u <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +36u => 36u >=48 => u >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nBut u <=2.305 and u>=1.333, u integer, u=2\n\nu=2: -83 + 72 = -11 <=0, 0 <= -48 + 72 = 24, true\n\nu=1: 0 <= -48 +36 = -12? false\n\nu=3: -83 + 108=25 <=0? false\n\nSo only u=2, t=32\n\nUnsafe at u=2, t=32.\n\nNow row 7: car (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nSpan: [-95 + 48u, -48 + 48u]\n\n0 in span if -95 +48u <=0 <= -48 +48u\n\nFirst: -95+48u <=0 => 48u <=95 => u <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +48u => 48u >=48 => u >=1\n\nSo u >=1 and u <=1.979, u integer, u=1\n\nu=1: -95+48= -47 <=0, 0 <= -48+48=0, true\n\nu=2: -95+96=1 <=0? false\n\nSo unsafe at u=1, t=31\n\nSimilarly row 8: same as row 7, (-48,-95,right,48), unsafe at u=1, t=31.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, unsafe times (turn t, or u=t-30)\n\n- Row 1: always safe\n\n- Row 2: unsafe at u=8,9 (t=38,39)\n\n- Row 3: unsafe at u=8,9 (t=38,39)\n\n- Row 4: unsafe at u=8,9 (t=38,39)\n\n- Row 5: unsafe at u=8,9 (t=38,39)\n\n- Row 6: unsafe at u=2 (t=32)\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at u=1 (t=31)\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at u=1 (t=31)\n\nWe need to go from y=0 at u=0 to y=9 at some u=H.\n\nAt each step, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row y at time u when it is unsafe for that y.\n\nFor example, at time u, if we are on row y, and y is between 1 and 8, and it is unsafe at that u, collision.\n\nNow, since row 1 is always safe, no problem.\n\nRow 6 is unsafe only at u=2, t=32.\n\nRow 7 and 8 unsafe at u=1, t=31.\n\nRows 2-5 unsafe at u=8 and u=9, t=38,39.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so probably go up as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal H=9: go up 9 times in a row, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps.\n\nAt time u, position y_u.\n\nu=0: y=0 (safe)\n\nAfter a0, u=1: y=1? Action at u=0 (turn 30) determines y at u=1.\n\nPosition at time u is after u steps.\n\nAt u=0: y=0\n\nApply a0: if U, y=1 at u=1; if S, y=0 at u=1; if D, y=-1 but y must be >=0, so D not possible at y=0, similarly at y=9, U not possible.\n\ny in [0,9], so at y=0, cannot go down; at y=9, cannot go up.\n\nFor u=0, y=0, we can do U to go to y=1 at u=1, or S to stay at y=0 at u=1.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so we should go up.\n\nSimilarly, minimal path: always U if possible.\n\nBut check if we can do U all the way without collision.\n\nSuppose we do U at each step from u=0 to u=8.\n\nThen:\n\nu=0: y=0 (safe)\n\na0=U → u=1: y=1\n\nNow at u=1, y=1, which is row 1, always safe, ok.\n\na1=U → u=2: y=2\n\nAt u=2, y=2, row 2. Is row 2 safe at u=2? From above, row 2 unsafe only at u=8 and u=9, not at u=2. u=2 is early.\n\nRow 2 unsafe at u=8,9 only, so at u=2, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 3,4,5 same.\n\nBut row 6 is unsafe at u=2.\n\nBut at u=2, y=2, not row 6.\n\ny=2 is row 2, which is safe at u=2.\n\nThen a2=U → u=3: y=3\n\ny=3, row 3, safe at u=3.\n\na3=U → u=4: y=4\n\ny=4, row 4, safe.\n\na4=U → u=5: y=5\n\ny=5, row 5, safe.\n\na5=U → u=6: y=6\n\nAt u=6, y=6, row 6.\n\nRow 6 unsafe at u=2, but u=6, so is it safe?\n\nWe have row 6 unsafe only at u=2, so at u=6, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, a6=U → u=7: y=7\n\ny=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at u=1, not u=7, so safe.\n\na7=U → u=8: y=8\n\ny=8, row 8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at u=1, not u=8, so safe.\n\na8=U → u=9: y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need y=9 at some point, here at u=9, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions? Let's see.\n\nWe applied actions from a0 to a8, that's 9 actions: τ=0 to 8, actions at u=0 to u=8.\n\nPosition after last action: at u=9, y=9.\n\nWe want to reach y=9, which is at time u=9.\n\nNow, check if any position was unsafe.\n\nu=0: y=0 safe\n\nu=1: y=1, row 1, safe\n\nu=2: y=2, row 2, safe (since unsafe only at u=8,9)\n\nu=3: y=3, row 3, safe\n\nu=4: y=4, row 4, safe\n\nu=5: y=5, row 5, safe\n\nu=6: y=6, row 6, unsafe only at u=2, u=6 safe\n\nu=7: y=7, row 7, unsafe only at u=1, u=7 safe\n\nu=8: y=8, row 8, unsafe only at u=1, u=8 safe\n\nu=9: y=9 safe\n\nAll safe? But at u=2, we were on y=2, which is safe, not on row 6.\n\nRow 6 is unsafe at u=2, but we were not on row 6 at u=2, we were on row 2.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7 and 8 unsafe at u=1, but at u=1 we were on row 1, not 7 or 8.\n\nSo in this path, no problem, we can reach in 9 turns with all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor row 6, unsafe at u=2, t=32.\n\nAt u=2, if we were on row 6, collision, but in this path, at u=2, we are on y=2, row 2, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at u=1, on y=1, safe; rows 7 and 8 unsafe at u=1, but we not on them.\n\nThen at u=8 and u=9, rows 2-5 unsafe, but in the path, at u=8, we are on y=8, row 8, which is safe; at u=9, y=9, safe.\n\nRow 8 is safe at u=8, since unsafe only at u=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo with all U, we can reach in 9 actions.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) at turn 30, which is u=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions: actions at turn 30 to 38, positions from u=1 to u=9.\n\nAction at turn 30: a_t1 = a_{30}, which is for τ=0.\n\nAfter a_{30}, position at turn 31, y=1.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{38}, position at turn 39, y=9.\n\nturns: turn 30: position y=0\n\nAfter action at turn 30: position at turn 31, y=1\n\nAfter action at turn 31: position at turn 32, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 38: position at turn 39, y=9\n\nSo at turn 39, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn when we are on a freeway, if collision.\n\nAt turn 31: y=1, on row 1, always safe.\n\nTurn 32: y=2, on row 2. Row 2 unsafe at turn 38 and 39, not 32, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 33: y=3, row 3 safe\n\nTurn 34: y=4, row 4 safe\n\nTurn 35: y=5, row 5 safe\n\nTurn 36: y=6, row 6. Now row 6 unsafe at turn 32? Turn t=32, u=t-30=2, yes u=2.\n\nBut at turn 36, u=6, not u=2, so safe? Turn 36 is t=36, u=6.\n\nRow 6 unsafe only at u=2, t=32.\n\nAt t=36, u=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 37: y=7, row 7. Row 7 unsafe at u=1, t=31. At t=37, u=7, safe.\n\nTurn 38: y=8, row 8. Row 8 unsafe at u=1, t=31. At t=38, u=8, safe.\n\nTurn 39: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at turn 38, we are on y=8, and row 2-5 are unsafe at turn 38, but we are on row 8, not on row 2-5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can reach in 9 turns with all U.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row 6 at u=2.\n\nAt u=2, t=32, row 6 car span: [-83 + 36*2, -48 + 36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], so 0 in [-11,24], yes, unsafe.\n\nBut at that time, we were not on row 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at u=1, t=31: span [-95+48*1, -48+48*1] = [-47,0], 0 in it, unsafe.\n\nBut at t=31, we were on y=1, row 1.\n\nRow 1 car: at t=31, u=1, span [37+12*1,48+12*1]=[49,60], not cover 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9, with actions all U.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? From 0 to 9, min 9 steps, since each step changes y by at most 1. So H=9 is minimal possible.\n\nThus, with no delays, we can do it.\n\nBut in the car states, for rows 2-5, they are unsafe at u=8,9, but we are past that when we go through.\n\nIn the path, we are on row 2 at u=2, which is early, before u=8.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nSequence: at each turn from t=30 to t=38, action U.\n\nBut actions from t=30 to t=38, that's 9 actions.\n\nPosition reached at t=39.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=30, H=9, so actions for t=30 to 38.\n\nEach action U.\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 39, position (0,9).\n\nBut is there any issue at turn 38 or 39?\n\nAt turn 38, we are on y=8, which is row 8, safe.\n\nRow 2-5 unsafe at turn 38, but not relevant.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to be at y=9 exactly at some turn.\n\nBut we are.\n\nAnother thing: the car update, but I think I handled.\n\nBut let me check row 7 and 8 at u=1.\n\nAt u=1, t=31, row 7 span [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0], 0 included.\n\nRow 8 same.\n\nBut we not on them.\n\nNow, for row 2-5, unsafe at u=8,9.\n\nu=8, t=38; u=9, t=39.\n\nAt t=38, if we were on row 2-5, unsafe, but we are on row 8.\n\nAt t=39, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut the player position: at turn 30, (0,0)\n\nAfter U at 30, at 31: (0,1)\n\nAfter U at 31, at 32: (0,2)\n\n...\n\nAfter U at 38, at 39: (0,9)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, we need to specify from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=9, so turns 30 to 38.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, at turn 32, t=32, u=2, we are on y=2.\n\nRow 2 car: at t=32, u=2, span for row 2: [-59 +6*2, -48 +6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], which is all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at t=32, u=2, span [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], 0 in, unsafe, but we not on row 6.\n\nAt t=32, we on row 2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and in this case, no collision.\n\nPerhaps for some rows, the car might be present at other times, but from calculation, only those times are unsafe.\n\nFor row 1, always safe.\n\nRow 6 only unsafe at u=2.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the answer format should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nAt u=0, t=30, span [-83, -48], all negative.\n\nu=1, t=31: [-83+36, -48+36]=[-47,-12], still negative.\n\nu=2, t=32: [-83+72, -48+72]=[-11,24], includes 0.\n\nu=3, t=33: [-83+108, -48+108]=[25,60], positive, no 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nOthers similar.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, we can go straight up.\n\nSo the sequence is all U for 9 actions.\n\nBut H=9, actions from t=30 to 38.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) is 9, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), as verified below.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe, as the car span never covers \\(x=0\\) for \\(t \\geq 30\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at turns 38 and 39. At turn 32 (when the player is on row 2), the car span is \\([-47, -36]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- **Freeway 3**: Identical to freeway 2, unsafe at turns 38 and 39.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 32. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=2 and want to go to y=9, we need to move up, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, the cars are on freeways 1 through 8. Each car is defined by its head, tail, direction, and speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, and for right-moving, it moves right. But all cars listed are right-moving, based on the direction given. Let me check:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12) — head is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me read the car update.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h]? No:\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd \"Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], with τ being the tail and h being the head? But in the table, for freeway 1, it says (-48, -59, right, 12). So h = -48, τ = -59? But if it's right-moving, and τ = -59, h = -48, since -48 > -59, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? The notation is a bit confusing.\n\nLet's clarify the notation. In the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nFor right-moving, direction right, and span at t_1 is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, with tail at left, head at right, so for movement to the right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h at left, τ at right or something.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, so for each, at t_1, span is [τ, h].\n\nFor freeway 1: h = -48, τ = -59, d=right, s=12. So τ = -59, h = -48, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 6) so τ = -47? No: it says head h, tail τ, so for freeway 2: h = -36, τ = -47, so span [τ, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway | h | τ | d | s | Span at t_1 (since right-moving, [τ, h])\n\n1: h=-48, τ=-59 → [ -59, -48 ]\n\n2: h=-36, τ=-47 → [ -47, -36 ]  τ=-47, h=-36\n\n3: same as 2? h=-36, τ=-47 → [ -47, -36 ]\n\n4: same, h=-36, τ=-47 → [ -47, -36 ]\n\n5: same, h=-36, τ=-47 → [ -47, -36 ]\n\n6: (24, -11, right, 36) → τ=-11, h=24? Head is 24, tail is -11, so [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\n7: (48, 1, right, 48) → τ=1, h=48? Head 48, tail 1, so [τ, h] = [1, 48]\n\n8: same as 7, (48, 1, right, 48) → [1, 48]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T), and they are on freeway y_T if y_T between 1 and 8.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible. Similarly, moving to y_{T+1}, at turn T, player is on y_T, not y_{T+1}, so only the car on y_T matters at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since at turn T, you are on y_T, so cars on other freeways don't matter. Only the car on the current freeway y_T can cause collision if 0 in its span at time T.\n\nCollision if player on freeway i at turn T, and for the car on i, 0 in Span_i(T).\n\nSince only one car per freeway? From the table, each freeway has one car listed, so I assume one car per freeway.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions from t=32 onwards to reach y=9 asap, starting from y=2.\n\nMinimal H such that after H turns, at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so at time t_1, action a_{t_1}, then position at t_1 +1 is y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}, and so on, up to after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the turn when position is (0,9) is at some turn T, and T = t_1 + H for some H? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1, before action, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,2).\n\nThen we apply action a_{t_1}, which affects position at turn t_1 +1: y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}.\n\nSimilarly, after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nWe want to reach position (0,9) at some turn T.\n\nT must be such that y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t_1 to t= T-1, because action at t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo, from t_1 to T-1, actions a_t for t = t_1 to T-1, and at time T, y_T =9.\n\nThe number of actions H = T - t_1.\n\nBecause actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1, and after that, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t_1, then at t_1+1, y=9 if we move up from 8, but we start at 2, so not possible.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 to y=9, which is 7 steps up, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nMinimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2, which is a freeway, we need to check if at t_1=32, on freeway 2, is there a collision?\n\nBut collision only if 0 in span at that turn.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway, at turn T, whether 0 is in the car span.\n\nGeneral formula: for a right-moving car, span at time T is [τ + s (T - t_1), h + s (T - t_1)] , since Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] with Δt = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nt_1 = 32.\n\nSo for any turn T, Δt = T - 32.\n\nCar on freeway i:\n\n- Freeway 1: τ = -59, h = -48, s=12, right\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 12*(T-32) , -48 + 12*(T-32) ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12Δt <= 0 <= -48 +12Δt for some Δt\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we care only when the player is on that freeway.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn 32.\n\nAt turn 32, position is (0,2), so on freeway 2.\n\nIs there a car on freeway 2? Yes, with τ=-47, h=-36, s=6.\n\nSpan at T=32: [ -47 + 6*(0) , -36 +6*0 ] = [-47, -36] since Δt=0.\n\n0 in [-47,-36]? -47 <= 0 <= -36? 0 is greater than -36? -36 is negative, 0 > -36, so 0 not <= -36, so 0 not in [-47,-36], since -36 < 0.\n\nSimilarly, all points negative, so no collision at t=32 on freeway 2.\n\nNow, we need to move up to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so once we reach y=9, we are safe.\n\nBut to reach there, we need to pass through freeways 3 to 8 or go directly, but we can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo the path must go through y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 to 9, but we can skip some by moving faster, but since we move one step at a time, we must visit each y from 2 to 9 sequentially, but not necessarily, because we can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, we should move up as much as possible.\n\nSince we can only change by -1,0,+1, we must pass through intermediate y values.\n\nFor example, from y=2, to y=9, we need at least 7 up moves, so minimum 7 actions if we go straight up, but we might need to wait or avoid, so H >=7.\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway, at what times the car is at x=0, meaning 0 in span.\n\nThen, the player should not be on that freeway at that time.\n\nSo let's find for each freeway i, the times T when collision is possible, i.e., 0 in span_i(T).\n\nFor freeway i, with given τ, h, s, right-moving.\n\n0 in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for Δt = T - 32.\n\nSo we need τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving, as head is right.\n\nIn the span [left, right], with left = τ + s Δt, right = h + s Δt, and since moving right, left increases.\n\n0 in [left, right] iff left <= 0 and 0 <= right, so τ + s Δt <= 0 and h + s Δt >= 0.\n\nThen Δt such that -h/s <= Δt <= -τ/s? Let's solve.\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 => s Δt <= -τ => Δt <= -τ/s\n\nAnd h + s Δt >= 0 => s Δt >= -h => Δt >= -h/s\n\nSince s >0.\n\nAlso, since h > τ, -h/s > -τ/s? No.\n\nh > τ, so -h < -τ, so -h/s < -τ/s since s>0.\n\nSo Δt >= ceil( -h/s ) and Δt <= floor( -τ/s )? But Δt integer.\n\nBetter to compute numerically.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, find the time window when 0 is in span.\n\nSince the car moves, 0 is covered for a certain period.\n\nΔt min when left <=0, i.e., τ + s Δt <=0, so Δt >= ceil( -τ/s )? Let's see.\n\nτ + s Δt <=0 => s Δt <= -τ => Δt <= floor( -τ/s )? No.\n\ns Δt <= -τ, since s>0, Δt <= floor( -τ/s ) if -τ/s not integer, but better to compute inequality.\n\nSimilarly, h + s Δt >=0 => s Δt >= -h => Δt >= ceil( -h/s )\n\nThen the window for Δt is from ceil( -h/s ) to floor( -τ/s )\n\nThen T = t_1 + Δt = 32 + Δt\n\nNow, let's compute for each.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: τ = -59, h = -48, s=12\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( - (-48)/12 ) = ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -(-48)/12 ) = ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\nAnd Δt <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -(-59)/12 ) = floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4\n\nfloor(4.916) =4\n\nNow, Δt >=4 and Δt <=4, so Δt=4\n\nCheck: at Δt=4, left = τ + s Δt = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nRight = h + s Δt = -48 + 48 =0\n\nSo span = [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since right=0.\n\n0 <=0 is true.\n\nAt Δt=3: left = -59 +12*3 = -59+36= -23, right= -48+36= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=5: left= -59+60=1, right= -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=4, T=32+4=36, on freeway 1, collision if player there.\n\nNow, freeway 2: τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -(-36)/6 ) = ceil(36/6) = ceil(6) =6\n\nΔt <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -(-47)/6 ) = floor(47/6) = floor(7.833) =7\n\nNow, Δt from 6 to 7 inclusive.\n\nAt Δt=6: left = τ + s Δt = -47 +6*6 = -47+36= -11, right= -36+36=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=7: left= -47+42= -5? -47+42= -5, right= -36+42=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=5: left= -47+30= -17, right= -36+30= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=8: left= -47+48=1, right= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision possible on freeway 2 at T=32+6=38 and T=32+7=39? T=32+Δt, so at Δt=6, T=38; Δt=7, T=39.\n\nt_1=32, Δt=0 at T=32, so Δt=6, T=38; Δt=7, T=39.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, τ=-47, h=-36, s=6, so same, collision at T=38 and 39.\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=38,39\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=38,39\n\nNow freeway 6: τ=-11, h=24, s=36? Head 24, tail -11, s=36\n\nτ=-11, h=24, s=36, right-moving.\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -24/36 ) = ceil( -2/3 ) = ceil(-0.666) = -0? Ceil of negative.\n\nCeil(-0.666) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -0.666, which is 0? No.\n\nCeil(x) is smallest integer >= x.\n\nSo ceil(-0.666) = 0, since -0.666 > -1, and 0 >= -0.666.\n\nSimilarly, floor(x) is largest integer <= x.\n\nNow, Δt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -24/36 ) = ceil( -2/3 ) = ceil(-0.666) = 0\n\nBecause -1 < -0.666 < 0, ceil is 0.\n\nAnd Δt <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -(-11)/36 ) = floor(11/36) = floor(0.305) = 0\n\nNow, Δt >=0 and <=0, so Δt=0\n\nAt T=32 +0=32, span: left= τ + s*0 = -11, right= h + s*0 =24, span [-11,24], which includes 0, since -11<=0<=24.\n\nYes.\n\nAt Δt=-1, but Δt = T - t_1, T>=t_1, so Δt >=0, so only at T=32.\n\nBut at T=32, we are on freeway 2, not on freeway 6, so for freeway 6, collision only if on it at T=32.\n\nBut player is on y=2 at T=32, not on y=6.\n\nSo for freeway 6, collision possible only at T=32, but since player not there, irrelevant for now.\n\nNow freeway 7: τ=1, h=48, s=48\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -48/48 ) = ceil(-1) = -1\n\nBut Δt >=0, since T>=t_1, so Δt >= max(0, ceil(-h/s)) but ceil(-h/s)=ceil(-1)= -1, but since Δt>=0, we take max with 0? Let's see the inequality.\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil(-48/48) = ceil(-1) = -1\n\nBut Δt >=0, so effectively Δt >=0? No, the constraint is Δt >= ceil(-h/s), which is -1, but since Δt >=0, we have Δt >=0.\n\nSimilarly, Δt <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -1/48 ) = floor(-0.02083) = -1\n\nBut Δt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-1/48) = floor(-0.02083) = -1\n\nBut Δt >=0, and Δt <= -1? Contradiction, meaning no solution.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nh + s Δt >=0 => 48 + 48 Δt >=0 always true for Δt >=0.\n\nτ + s Δt <=0 => 1 + 48 Δt <=0 => 48 Δt <= -1 => Δt <= -1/48 <0, impossible since Δt >=0.\n\nSo τ + s Δt =1 +48 Δt >0 for all Δt >=0, so left >0, so 0 not in span, since span is [left, right] with left >=1 >0.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=0, left=1, right=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nAt any T, left =1 +48(T-32) >=1 >0, so 0 never in span for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same as 7, τ=1, h=48, s=48, same, never collision.\n\nNow freeway 6 we have collision at T=32 only.\n\nBut freeways 1,2,3,4,5 have collision times.\n\nFreeway 1: collision at T=36\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=38 and 39\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, T=38,39\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=38,39\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=38,39\n\nFreeway 6: collision at T=32 only\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: no collision\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=32.\n\nAt T=32, on freeway 2, but as we saw, no collision there since car not at 0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are when we might be on a freeway when car is at 0.\n\nSpecifically, we should avoid:\n\n- On freeway 1 at T=36\n\n- On freeway 2 at T=38 or 39\n\n- On freeway 3 at T=38 or 39\n\nSimilarly for 4 and 5.\n\nBut freeways 3,4,5 all have same car, so same collision times.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=6,7,8 are freeways, but 7 and 8 have no collision, and y=6 has collision only at T=32, which is past, so no issue for y=6 except possibly if we are there at T=32, but we start at y=2.\n\nNow, let's list the constraints.\n\nPlayer position over time.\n\nLet T be the turn, starting from T=32.\n\nAt T=32, y=2.\n\nWe apply action at each T to set y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want y_T for T from 32 onwards.\n\ny_{T} is position at turn T.\n\nAfter action at T, position at T+1.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, position y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and on that freeway, car at 0.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each T, if y_T in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then not collision time for that freeway.\n\nNow, from above:\n\nFreeway 1: collision only at T=36\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=38 and 39\n\nFreeway 3: collision at T=38 and 39\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=38,39\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=38,39\n\nFreeway 6: collision at T=32 only\n\nFreeway 7: no collision\n\nFreeway 8: no collision\n\nNow, at T=32, we are on y=2, and for freeway 2, no collision at T=32, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 6 has collision at T=32, but we are not on it.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, need at least 7 up moves.\n\nIf we go straight up, we can reach in 7 turns: actions all U from T=32 to T=38, position at T=39 would be y=9.\n\nLet's see the path:\n\nAt T=32, y=2\n\nAfter action at T=32, if U, y_{33} =3\n\nSimilarly, action at T=33, if U, y_{34}=4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPosition at turn T:\n\nT=32: y=2\n\nT=33: y=3 (after U at T=32)\n\nT=34: y=4 (after U at T=33)\n\nT=35: y=5 (after U at T=34)\n\nT=36: y=6 (after U at T=35)\n\nT=37: y=7 (after U at T=36)\n\nT=38: y=8 (after U at T=37)\n\nT=39: y=9 (after U at T=38)\n\nNow, we need to check for each T from 32 to 38, if on freeway and collision.\n\nT=32: y=2, freeway 2, collision at T=38,39? At T=32, for freeway 2, we have collision at T=38 and 39, not at 32, so at T=32, no collision, safe.\n\nT=33: y=3, freeway 3. Collision for freeway 3 at T=38,39, not at 33, so safe.\n\nT=34: y=4, freeway 4, collision at T=38,39, not 34, safe.\n\nT=35: y=5, freeway 5, collision at T=38,39, not 35, safe.\n\nT=36: y=6, freeway 6. Collision for freeway 6 only at T=32. At T=36, not collision time, so safe? Freeway 6 car at T=36: let's compute.\n\nFor freeway 6: τ=-11, h=24, s=36\n\nAt T=36, Δt=36-32=4\n\nleft = τ + s Δt = -11 + 36*4 = -11 + 144 = 133\n\nright = h + s Δt = 24 + 144 = 168\n\nspan [133,168], not include 0, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=37: y=7, freeway 7, no collision ever, safe.\n\nT=38: y=8, freeway 8, no collision, safe.\n\nThen T=39: y=9, not freeway, goal.\n\nBut at T=36, y=6, safe, as above.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=36, y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut we have potential collisions at other times, but in this path, we are not at those positions at bad times.\n\nFor example, at T=36, we are on freeway 6, but collision for freeway 1 is at T=36, but freeway 1 is y=1, we are on y=6, different freeway.\n\nEach freeway has its own car, so only the car on the same row matters.\n\nSo in this case, for the straight up path, all positions are safe:\n\n- T=32: y=2, freeway 2 car not at 0\n\n- T=33: y=3, freeway 3 car not at 0 (car at 0 only at T=38,39)\n\n- T=34: y=4, similar\n\n- T=35: y=5, similar\n\n- T=36: y=6, freeway 6 car not at 0 (only at T=32)\n\n- T=37: y=7, freeway 7 no car at 0 ever\n\n- T=38: y=8, freeway 8 no car at 0\n\n- T=39: y=9, goal\n\nAt T=38, y=8, which is freeway 8, but no collision, and we reach y=9 at T=39.\n\nBut the actions: from T=32 to T=38, actions U each time, so 7 actions: a_{32} to a_{38}, and at T=39, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns H: from start to end.\n\nStart at T=32, after H actions, at time T=32 + H, position y=9.\n\nActions at t=32,33,...,32+H-1, position at 32+H.\n\nWe want y_{32+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with all U, y_{39} =9, so H=7, actions at t=32 to 38.\n\nt from 32 to 38 inclusive, that's 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nAt T=38, for freeway 2, there is collision, but we are on y=8, not y=2, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 2 collision at T=38 and T=39, but at T=38, player on y=8, not on freeway 2.\n\nAt T=39, player on y=9, not on any freeway.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut freeway 1 collision at T=36, but at T=36, player on y=6, not y=1.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, with 7 actions all up, we can reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the position at each turn.\n\nTurn T: position y_T\n\nAction at T determines y_{T+1}\n\nAt T=32: y=2\n\nAction a_{32}: if U, then y_{33} = 2+1=3\n\nSimilarly,\n\na_{33}: U, y_{34}=4\n\na_{34}: U, y_{35}=5\n\na_{35}: U, y_{36}=6\n\na_{36}: U, y_{37}=7\n\na_{37}: U, y_{38}=8\n\na_{38}: U, y_{39}=9\n\nNow, at each turn T, we need to check if on freeway and collision.\n\nT=32: y=2, freeway 2, car: at T=32, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=33: y=3, freeway 3, car same as freeway 2? Freeway 3 has its own car, with τ=-47, h=-36, s=6, same as freeway 2.\n\nAt T=33, for freeway 3: Δt=33-32=1\n\nleft = τ + s Δt = -47 +6*1= -41\n\nright = h + s Δt = -36 +6= -30\n\nspan [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=34: y=4, freeway 4 car: same, Δt=2, left=-47+12=-35, right=-36+12=-24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nT=35: y=5, freeway 5 car: Δt=3, left=-47+18=-29, right=-36+18=-18, span [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nT=36: y=6, freeway 6 car: Δt=4, left=-11 +36*4= -11+144=133, right=24+144=168, no 0, safe.\n\nT=37: y=7, freeway 7: no collision ever, safe.\n\nT=38: y=8, freeway 8: no collision, safe.\n\nT=39: y=9, goal.\n\nSo all safe, and we reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? 7 is minimum since 9-2=7 steps.\n\nWe could go faster? No, only one step per turn.\n\nOr by moving down, but that would take more turns, so no need.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7, with all actions U.\n\nBut let's check if at any point we need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at T=36, freeway 1 has collision, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at T=38, freeway 2 has collision, but we are on y=8.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? From y=2 to y=9 in 7 steps, impossible in less.\n\ny_{32}=2, after 6 actions, y_{38} could be at most 8 if all U, then need one more to 9.\n\nSo minimum 7 turns.\n\nAnd in this case, it works with no issue.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has a car that was at 0 at T=32, but we were not there.\n\nIn the sequence, we are at y=6 at T=36, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think we can just go straight up.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nSo actions from t_1=32 to t_1 + H -1 = 32+6=38? H=7 actions, from t=32 to 38.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +6: a_{38} = U\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 32 + 7 -1 = 38, yes.\n\nAnd position at t_1 + H = 39 is (0,9)\n\nNow, but let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nIn our case, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we move to y_{T+1}, so at T, we are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so for example, when we are at T=36, y=6, we move to y=7, so at T=36, we are on y=6, and the car on y=6 is fine.\n\nIf we were to be on y=7 at T=36, but we are not, because we move at the end of the turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, I think, based on position at turn T.\n\nThe game dynamics say: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is position at turn T.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, at T=38, if we were on y=2, but we are not.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=8 at T=38.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, no issue.\n\nSo I think all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 39, position (0,9)\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the turn labels: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 32: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut is there any reason to do something else? For example, if we go slower, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nPerhaps avoid being on freeway 5 at T=38, but in our case, we are past that.\n\nAt T=38, freeways 2,3,4,5 have collision, but we are on y=8.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 1 collision at T=36, but we are on y=6.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer turns by moving down, but that doesn't help, since we need to net +7.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nAt T=32, car on freeway 6 at 0, but we are not there.\n\nIn the sequence, we arrive at y=6 at T=36, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, at T=32, we are there but no collision.\n\nI think it's okay.\n\nSo minimal H=7 with all up actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 32\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns required to move from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 7, as each \"U\" action increases the y-coordinate by 1, and 7 up moves are needed to cover the 7-unit difference.\n\nThe car states and collision times are as follows:\n- Freeway 1: Collision at \\(T = 36\\).\n- Freeway 2: Collisions at \\(T = 38\\) and \\(T = 39\\).\n- Freeway 3: Collisions at \\(T = 38\\) and \\(T = 39\\).\n- Freeway 4: Collisions at \\(T = 38\\) and \\(T = 39\\).\n- Freeway 5: Collisions at \\(T = 38\\) and \\(T = 39\\).\n- Freeway 6: Collision only at \\(T = 32\\).\n- Freeway 7: No collision at any time.\n- Freeway 8: No collision at any time.\n\nA sequence of all \"U\" actions from turn 32 to turn 38 results in the following positions:\n- At turn 32: \\(y = 2\\) (no collision on freeway 2 at \\(T = 32\\)).\n- At turn 33: \\(y = 3\\) (no collision on freeway 3 at \\(T = 33\\)).\n- At turn 34: \\(y = 4\\) (no collision on freeway 4 at \\(T = 34\\)).\n- At turn 35: \\(y = 5\\) (no collision on freeway 5 at \\(T = 35\\)).\n- At turn 36: \\(y = 6\\) (no collision on freeway 6 at \\(T = 36\\)).\n- At turn 37: \\(y = 7\\) (no collision on freeway 7).\n- At turn 38: \\(y = 8\\) (no collision on freeway 8).\n- At turn 39: \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, no freeway).\n\nThis path avoids all collisions, as the player is not on any freeway during its collision times (e.g., not on freeway 1 at \\(T = 36\\), not on freeways 2-5 at \\(T = 38\\) or \\(T = 39\\), etc.). Since 7 is the minimum possible turns and the sequence is collision-free, it is optimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 32: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: & U \\end{array} }",

Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn. The player is only on a freeway when they are actually on that row at that turn. If they move to a different row, they're not on the previous row anymore.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=36, and we need to find where they are at future turns. For each car, we have the head, tail, direction, and speed. The span is given, and for right-moving cars, head > tail, I think? Let me check the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12). Since direction is right, head should be greater, so h=48, τ=37? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right, head is the front, so h > τ.\n\nSimilarly, for others, like freeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36). -48 > -83, so head is -48, tail is -83.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48), head -48, tail -95.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for the row y_T, if there's a car on that row, and 0 is within the car's span at T.\n\nThe player starts at y=0. y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0, there are no cars, so it's safe. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nSo the player needs to move up through y=1 to y=8 to reach y=9.\n\nBut they have to avoid being on a row when a car is covering position 0 at that turn.\n\nSince the player moves one row at a time, and actions are per turn, we need to simulate the path.\n\nThe minimal H might be just moving up as fast as possible, but we have to check if that causes a collision.\n\nFastest way: from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so H=9 turns? But we start at turn t_1, and after H turns, we are at turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we are at position for turn t_1 +1? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the player has position y_T, and actions are taken at each turn to determine y_{T+1}.\n\nFrom the dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision: at turn T, if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nThe player is on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf they move to a different row at turn T, they are not on that row until the next turn.\n\nSpecifically: at turn T, player is at position y_T. Then they choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision check is only at the position y_T at turn T.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, y_T = k, and on freeway k, 0 is in span at T, collision.\n\nIf y_T = k, but they move to k+1 or k-1 at T+1, at turn T, they are still on k.\n\nNow, the cars move continuously over turns.\n\nGiven t_1=36, player at (0,0).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, and y=9 is safe, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go directly up, we need to be on each y from 1 to 8 for one turn each, but we can skip some if we stay or move down, but since we need to go up, moving down might not help, probably we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we might need to wait on some rows to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k=1 to 8, the car positions at any turn T.\n\nT is the turn number, starting from t_1=36.\n\nFor a future turn T, the span for each car.\n\nSince collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at turn T for the row y_T.\n\nBut y_T depends on the player's path.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions that gets to y=9 quickly without being on a row when a car covers 0.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to be at y=9, the path must go through each y from 0 to 9, but we can be on multiple turns on some rows if we stay.\n\nBut minimal H would be to move up every turn, so in 9 actions: from turn t_1 to t_1+8, actions U each time, then at turn t_1+8, y_{t_1+8} = 8? Let's index carefully.\n\nSet t=0 at relative turn, so at absolute turn T = t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt t=0 (T=36), position y = 0.\n\nAction a_{t_1 + t} at time t.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t}, the position for turn T = t_1 + t + 1? No.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, setting y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for turn T, we have y_T, and a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T.\n\nIn this case, at T=36, y_36 = 0.\n\nAction a_36 determines y_37.\n\nThen at T=37, y_37, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\nAfter H actions, from t=0 to H-1, we have set y up to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSequence: actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, total H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, because each action sets the next position.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, we have positions from y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAt turn t_1, y_{t_1} is given.\n\nThen after action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to after a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H - 1, which is set by action a_{t_1 + H - 2}? Let's clarify the indices.\n\nDenote absolute turn T.\n\nAt T = t_1, y_T = 0 (given).\n\nThen, at T, we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt T+1, we choose a_{T+1}, determines y_{T+2}, and so on.\n\nWe want that at some turn S, y_S = 9.\n\nS = t_1 + H - 1, and we have actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2} to reach y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's see the sequence length.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1 +1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, we have y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, ..., after a_{t_1 + H - 1}, y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is set by action a_{t_1 + H - 2}, for H >=1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then only one action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}, and we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} =0, which is not 9, so H must be at least 9 to go from 0 to 9.\n\nAt T=t_1, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThis is set by action a_{t_1 + H -2}, for H>1.\n\nThe last action that affects it is a_{t_1 + H -2} if H>1, but for the position at T= t_1 + H -1, it is determined by actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets up to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSince we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9, so we don't need to go further, but the action at t_1 + H -1 would set y_{t_1 + H}, but if we are already at 9, we can choose S or something, but the position at t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nIn terms of turns, to reach y=9, the minimal number of turns from y=0 is 9 moves up, so we need to be at turn S where y_S =9, and S = t_1 + K for some K.\n\nThe first possible turn to be at y=9 is t_1 +9, if we move up every turn.\n\nAt T=t_1, y=0\n\nAfter a_{t_1} = U, y_{t_1 +1} =1\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +1} = U, y_{t_1 +2} =2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +8} = U, y_{t_1 +9} =9\n\nSo at turn t_1 +9, y=9.\n\nAnd we have actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 +8}, that's 9 actions, so H=9, and y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +8} for H=9? t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9 -1 = t_1 +8, which is y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem: y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=9, y_{t_1 +8} =8 if we move up, but we want it to be 9.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to be at 9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=t_1, to y=9 at S, the number of actions to reach S is S - t_1.\n\ny_S =9, and S = t_1 + M for some M.\n\nThe actions from T=t_1 to T=S-1 determine y_S.\n\ny_S is determined by actions from a_{t_1} to a_{S-1}.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to S-1, that's (S-1) - t_1 +1 = S - t_1 actions.\n\nThen y_S =9.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so let S = t_1 + H -1, then y_S =9, and number of actions to set y_S is from a_{t_1} to a_{S-1} = a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, it must be set by actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nWith H actions, we can have positions from y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is set by a_{t_1 + H -2} for H>1.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and with H actions, the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} sets y_{t_1 + H}, which could be anything, but we don't care as long as y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor minimal H, we want the smallest H such that we can have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 with some sequence.\n\nFrom y=0 at t_1, to y=9 at S, the minimal S is t_1+9, with 9 actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+8}, setting y_{t_1+1} to y_{t_1+9} =9.\n\nThen at turn S = t_1+9, y=9.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf S = t_1+9, then y_{t_1+9} =9, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen y_{t_1 +10 -1} = y_{t_1+9} =9.\n\nWith H=10 actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9}, but the last action a_{t_1+9} sets y_{t_1+10}, which is after we are at 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t_1+9, we only need actions up to a_{t_1+8}, 9 actions.\n\nBut for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with H=10, y_{t_1+9} =9, and actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9}, which includes an extra action at t_1+9 that sets y_{t_1+10}, but since we are already at 9, we can choose S, so y_{t_1+10} =9 or something, but it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for minimal H, if we can reach in fewer turns by moving faster, but we can only move one step at a time, so minimum 9 steps to go from 0 to 9, so S min is t_1+9, with y_{t_1+9} =9, so for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut that seems odd because we have an extra action.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is off.\n\nAnother way: the sequence has H actions, and after H actions, we have set y up to y_{t_1 + H}, but we want the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSince at turn t_1, position is given, after 0 actions, position at t_1 is 0.\n\nAfter 1 action, position at t_1+1 is set.\n\nAfter k actions, position at t_1+k is set.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, which means after (H-1) actions, position at t_1 + (H-1) is 9.\n\nWith (H-1) actions, we can go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 actions, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen with 10 actions, we can set y_{t_1+1} to y_{t_1+10}, and y_{t_1+9} =9.\n\nAnd the sequence is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9}, 10 actions.\n\nBut for the position at t_1+9 to be 9, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+8} to move up, so a_{t_1+9} can be S or U or D, but since y=9, U or D might go out of bound, so probably S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's included.\n\nPerhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can think of H as the number of turns from start until we reach, but let's stick to the definition.\n\nTo minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1 with a sequence of H actions.\n\nMinimal H is 10, if we can do it in 9 moves, but with 9 moves we reach at t_1+9, which would require H such that t_1 + H -1 = t_1+9, so H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car avoidance.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the car span at turn T.\n\nT is absolute turn, t_1=36.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span depends on the direction.\n\nFor right-moving car: span at T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince at t_1, span is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right, speed 12, head 48, tail 37 at t_1=36.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) so head -48, tail -59? No, for right-moving, head is the front, so if direction right, head should be greater than tail.\n\nIn freeway 2: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\n-48 > -59, so head = -48, tail = -59.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAll are right-moving, so for each, span at T is [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)]\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s(T-36) <= 0 <= h + s(T-36)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ < h, so the span is from left to right.\n\nSo 0 in span if τ + s(T-36) <= 0 <= h + s(T-36)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow for each freeway k, we need when 0 is covered for that row.\n\nBut since the player may be on different rows at different times, we need to ensure that for each turn T when the player is on row k, 0 is not in the span for that k at T.\n\nNow, let's list for each k the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, head h=48, tail τ=37, s=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12(T-36), 48 + 12(T-36)]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12(T-36) <= 0 <= 48 + 12(T-36)\n\nSince 37 + 12(T-36) > 0 for T>=36? Let's solve.\n\nLower bound L1(T) = 37 + 12(T-36)\n\nUpper bound U1(T) = 48 + 12(T-36)\n\nL1(T) <= 0 <= U1(T)\n\nFirst, L1(T) <= 0: 37 + 12(T-36) <= 0\n\n12(T-36) <= -37\n\nT-36 <= -37/12 = -3.083, so T-36 <= -4 since T integer, T-36 <= -4, T <= 32\n\nBut T=36 is current, and T> t_1 for future, so for T>=36, L1(T) = 37 + 12(T-36) >= 37 >0, so L1(T) >0 for all T>=36.\n\nThus, 0 < L1(T) <= U1(T), so 0 < L1(T) <= something, so 0 is less than lower bound, not in span.\n\nSince L1(T) >0 and U1(T) >0 for T>=36, 0 is not in [L1,U1] because L1>0.\n\nSimilarly, U1(T) =48 +12(T-36) >0, so indeed for T>=36, on freeway 1, 0 is never covered because the car is always to the right of 0? At T=36, span [37,48], all positive, so x from 37 to 48, position 0 is not covered.\n\nAs T increases, the car moves right, so even further right, so 0 never covered on freeway 1.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe; no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, s=6, right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)] = [-59 + 6(T-36), -48 + 6(T-36)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6(T-36) <= 0 <= -48 + 6(T-36)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 6(T-36) <= 0 => 6(T-36) <= 59 => T-36 <= 59/6 = 9.833, so T-36 <= 9, T <= 45\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 6(T-36) => 48 <= 6(T-36) => 8 <= T-36 => T >= 44\n\nSo T >= 44 and T <= 45\n\nThus for T=44 and T=45, 0 is covered on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars for freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 6), identical to freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: same (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nAll from 2 to 5 are the same: head -48, tail -59, speed 6.\n\nSo for each, 0 covered at T=44 and 45.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, head h=-48, tail τ=-83, s=36, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-83 + 36(T-36), -48 + 36(T-36)]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36(T-36) <= 0 <= -48 + 36(T-36)\n\nFirst: -83 + 36(T-36) <= 0 => 36(T-36) <= 83 => T-36 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-36 <= 2, T <= 38\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 36(T-36) => 48 <= 36(T-36) => 48/36 <= T-36 => 4/3 ≈1.333 <= T-36, so T-36 >= 2 since integer? 1.333, so T-36 >= 2? T-36 >= ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's see.\n\n0 <= -48 + 36(T-36) => 36(T-36) >= 48 => T-36 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since T integer, T-36 >= 2\n\nSimilarly, first inequality: T-36 <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo T-36 <= 2 and T-36 >= 2, so T-36 = 2, T=38\n\nThus only at T=38, 0 is covered on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, head h=-48, tail τ=-95, s=48, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-95 + 48(T-36), -48 + 48(T-36)]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48(T-36) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(T-36)\n\nFirst: -95 + 48(T-36) <= 0 => 48(T-36) <= 95 => T-36 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so T-36 <= 1, T <= 37\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 48(T-36) => 48 <= 48(T-36) => 1 <= T-36, T >= 37\n\nThus T >=37 and T <=37, so T=37.\n\nOnly at T=37, 0 covered on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8: k=8, same as 7: (-48, -95, right, 48), so only at T=37, 0 covered.\n\nNow, freeway 1: always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5: unsafe at T=44 and 45\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=38\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=37\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=37\n\nThe player starts at T=36, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal path: go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\nFor row 1: always safe\n\nRow 2: unsafe at T=44,45\n\nSimilarly row 3,4,5 same, unsafe at T=44,45\n\nRow 6: unsafe at T=38\n\nRow 7: unsafe at T=37\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=37\n\nNow, the player must not be on row k at turn T when k is unsafe at T.\n\nFor example, if we go straight up:\n\nStart T=36, y=0\n\nAction U: T=37, y=1\n\nBut at T=37, row 7 and 8 are unsafe, but y=1, so on row 1, which is safe.\n\nAction U: T=38, y=2, on row 2, which is safe? Row 2 unsafe only at T=44,45, T=38 is fine.\n\nRow 2 unsafe at T=44,45, T=38 is earlier, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 unsafe at T=38, but at T=38, if y=2, not on row 6.\n\nContinue: action U: T=39, y=3, safe\n\nT=40, y=4, safe\n\nT=41, y=5, safe\n\nT=42, y=6, on row 6. Row 6 unsafe at T=38, but T=42 >38, so should be safe? We need to check if at T=42, 0 covered on row 6.\n\nFor row 6, we have unsafe only at T=38.\n\nAt T=42, span: from earlier, for row 6, span at T: [-83 +36(T-36), -48 +36(T-36)]\n\nAt T=42, T-36=6, so [-83 + 36*6, -48 + 36*6] = [-83 + 216, -48 + 216] = [133, 168], all positive, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 unsafe at T=37, at T=42, span: [-95 +48(T-36), -48 +48(T-36)] at T=42, T-36=6, [-95+288, -48+288]=[193,240], safe.\n\nNow back to the path: at T=36, y=0\n\na36: U, so y37=1\n\nAt T=37, y=1, row 1 safe.\n\na37: U, y38=2\n\nAt T=38, y=2, row 2 safe (unsafe only at 44,45)\n\na38: U, y39=3\n\na39: U, y40=4\n\na40: U, y41=5\n\na41: U, y42=6\n\nAt T=42, y=6, row 6, safe as above.\n\na42: U, y43=7\n\nAt T=43, y=7, row 7. Row 7 unsafe only at T=37, T=43>37, span at T=43: T-36=7, [-95+48*7, -48+48*7]=[-95+336, -48+336]=[241,288], safe.\n\na43: U, y44=8\n\nAt T=44, y=8, row 8. Row 8 unsafe at T=37, but T=44, span: for row 8, same as row 7? Freeway 8 has car, span at T: [-95 +48(T-36), -48 +48(T-36)] for T=44, T-36=8, [-95+384, -48+384]=[289,336], safe.\n\nBut row 8 is unsafe only at T=37, so at T=44 safe.\n\na44: U, y45=9\n\nAt T=45, y=9, which is goal, no car, safe.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at T=45.\n\nT=45 is turn t_1 + 9, since t_1=36, 36+9=45.\n\nNow, actions: from a36 to a44, that's 9 actions: a36 to a44, all U.\n\nThen y45=9.\n\nNow, for the output, we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere, at T=45, y=9, which is t_1 +9.\n\nSet S = t_1 +9 =45.\n\ny_S =9.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen the sequence should include actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{36} to a_{45}, but a_{45} is at T=45, which sets y_{46}, but we don't care.\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions we reach at T=45, but for H=10, we need 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have a_{45} as S.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nIn the above path, we reached at T=45 with 9 up moves.\n\nCan we reach earlier? From y=0 at T=36, to y=9, minimal is at T=45 with 9 up moves.\n\nBut at T=36, y=0, after first U at T=36, y37=1, and so on, up to a44 U at T=44, y45=9.\n\nSo position at T=45 is 9.\n\nIf we want to be at y=9 at an earlier turn, but from y=0, we can't be at y=9 before T=45, since it takes 9 moves.\n\nT=36: y=0\n\nT=37: y=1\n\n...\n\nT=45: y=9\n\nSo minimal at T=45.\n\nNow for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with t_1=36, so 36 + H -1 =45, so 35 + H =45, H=10.\n\nThen y_{36 + 10 -1} = y_{45} =9.\n\nActions from a_{36} to a_{45}, 10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{36} to a_{44} should be U to move up, and a_{45} can be S to stay.\n\nIn the above, we didn't have any collision because we avoided the unsafe times.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=37, rows 7 and 8 are unsafe, but in our path, at T=37, we were on row 1, which is safe.\n\nAt T=38, row 6 unsafe, but we were on row 2, safe.\n\nAt T=44 and 45, rows 2,3,4,5 are unsafe, but at T=44, we were on row 8, which for row 8, unsafe only at T=37, so at T=44 it is safe, as computed.\n\nAt T=45, we are on row 9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? No, because we start from y=0 at T=36.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but we can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nPerhaps by moving down or staying, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut with H=10, we need to specify 10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{36} to a_{44}: U, and a_{45}: S, since we are at y=9.\n\nBut at T=45, we are at y=9, so we can choose S.\n\nNow, but let's list the turns.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t_1=36.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for H=10, turns from 36 to 45.\n\nActions: for turn 36: U (to y=1 at T=37)\n\nTurn 37: U (to y=2 at T=38)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 44: U (to y=9 at T=45)\n\nThen at turn 45: we need an action, but since y=9, we can choose S, so a_{45}=S, then y_{46}=9, but we don't care about y_{46}.\n\nAnd at turn 45, position is y_{45}=9, which is what we want.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{36+10-1} = y_{45}=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars at T=44 and 45?\n\nAt T=44, in our path, y_{44}=8, on row 8, which is safe as we said.\n\nSimilarly, at T=45, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nBut rows 2-5 are unsafe at T=44 and 45, but we are not on them.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with fewer actions by not moving every turn, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point, it takes longer.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have 9 U moves and one S, but the S is at the end.\n\nSince we need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1, and with H=10, it's at T=45.\n\nBut let's see if we can be at y=9 at an earlier turn with a different path.\n\nFor example, at T=36, y=0.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay, y=0, but we need to move up.\n\nSuppose at T=36, we do S, y_{37}=0, then we are still at 0, but we lost a turn, then we need more turns to reach y=9, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, moving down not helpful.\n\nSo direct up is fastest.\n\nBut in this case, we avoided the unsafe times naturally.\n\nNow, what about row 6 at T=38 unsafe.\n\nIn our path, at T=38, we were on row 2, not 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 and 8 at T=37 unsafe, but at T=37 we were on row 1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a row that is unsafe when we need to pass?\n\nFor example, row 7 is unsafe only at T=37.\n\nIf we were on row 7 at T=37, it would be bad, but in fast path, we are on row 7 later, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, but we have multiple freeways with the same unsafe times.\n\nBut in this path, it works.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower to avoid, but no need.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car for freeway 1.\n\nEarlier I said freeway 1 always safe, but let's double-check.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=36, span [37,48], all >0.\n\nAt any T>36, span moves right, so always >0, so 0 never covered, yes.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2-5, unsafe only at T=44,45.\n\nIn our path, at T=44, we are on row 8, not on 2-5.\n\nAt T=45, on row 9.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nH=10, actions: a_{36} to a_{45}.\n\na_{36}: U\n\na_{37}: U\n\na_{38}: U\n\na_{39}: U\n\na_{40}: U\n\na_{41}: U\n\na_{42}: U\n\na_{43}: U\n\na_{44}: U\n\na_{45}: S\n\nIn the sequence, a_{44}: U sets y_{45}=9, and a_{45}: S sets y_{46}=9, but since we care about position at T=45, it's fine.\n\nWe could have a_{44}: S, but then y_{45}=8, not 9, so we need to reach y=9 at T=45.\n\nWith a_{44}: U, y_{45}=9.\n\nThen a_{45} can be S.\n\nIn the action list, for turn 44: U, which is to move to y=9 at T=45.\n\nThen turn 45: S to stay.\n\nNow, in the output format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller? H=10 for y_{45}=9.\n\nIf we can be at y=9 earlier, but impossible from y=0 in fewer than 9 moves.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\n\nIn our case, it didn't come up.\n\nFor example, when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is only checked at the current position at turn T.\n\nSo in our path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for row 7 at T=37, if we were to move to row 7 at that time, but we are not.\n\nAnother thing: all freeways have cars, but for example, freeway 1 has a car but it never covers 0, so safe always.\n\nSimilarly, others have specific unsafe times.\n\nIn our direct path, we avoid all unsafe times.\n\nBut let's list when each row is unsafe:\n\nRow 1: never unsafe\n\nRow 2: unsafe at T=44,45\n\nRow 3: same, T=44,45\n\nRow 4: same, T=44,45\n\nRow 5: same, T=44,45\n\nRow 6: unsafe at T=38\n\nRow 7: unsafe at T=37\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=37\n\nIn the path:\n\nT=36: y=0 (safe)\n\nT=37: y=1 (row 1 safe)\n\nT=38: y=2 (row 2 safe, since unsafe only at 44,45)\n\nT=39: y=3 (safe)\n\nT=40: y=4 (safe)\n\nT=41: y=5 (safe)\n\nT=42: y=6 (row 6, safe at T=42)\n\nT=43: y=7 (row 7, safe at T=43)\n\nT=44: y=8 (row 8, safe at T=44)\n\nT=45: y=9 (safe)\n\nAll good.\n\nTo reach at T=45, we need actions from a_{36} to a_{44} all U, and for the sequence with H=10, we add a_{45} as S.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{36}, t=1: a_{37}, ..., t=9: a_{45} for H=10.\n\nActions: t=0 to 8: U, t=9: S.\n\nBut t=9 corresponds to a_{45}.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be minimal H, which is 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can have y=9 at an earlier turn by being clever, but I don't think so.\n\nSuppose we start at T=36, y=0.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay, then at T=37, y=0, then we can move, but we reach later.\n\nFor example, at T=37, if we go to y=1, same as before but one turn later.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps avoid being on row 7 at T=37, but in fast path, we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no need.\n\nSo I think direct up is fine.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 45, action S.\n\nTo write in the format.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=38, unsafe.\n\nIn our path, at T=38, y=2, not 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at T=37, y=1.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not moving on some turns, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down, but that would make it longer.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 and stay, but y=0 safe, but we need to go to 9, so it takes more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nThus the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Freeway 1**: The car (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12) never covers position 0 at any turn \\(T \\geq 36\\), as the span is always positive and moving right. Thus, row 1 is always safe.\n- **Freeways 2-5**: Each car (head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6) covers position 0 at turns \\(T = 44\\) and \\(T = 45\\). Thus, rows 2-5 are unsafe at these turns.\n- **Freeway 6**: The car (head=-48, tail=-83, direction=right, speed=36) covers position 0 only at turn \\(T = 38\\). Thus, row 6 is unsafe at this turn.\n- **Freeway 7**: The car (head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48) covers position 0 only at turn \\(T = 37\\). Thus, row 7 is unsafe at this turn.\n- **Freeway 8**: The car (head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48) covers position 0 only at turn \\(T = 37\\). Thus, row 8 is unsafe at this turn.\n\n### Minimal Path to (0, 9)\nThe player must move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 9 upward moves (each increasing \\(y\\) by 1). The fastest path reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45 (i.e., \\(t_1 + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45\\)) with 9 consecutive \"U\" actions starting from turn 36. However, to satisfy \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\) with \\(t_1 = 36\\), we need \\(y_{36 + H - 1} = 9\\). Setting \\(36 + H - 1 = 45\\) gives \\(H = 10\\). Thus, \\(H = 10\\) is minimal, and the sequence includes 9 \"U\" actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45, followed by an \"S\" action at turn 45 to stay at \\(y = 9\\) (since moving up or down would be invalid at \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThe path avoids all unsafe conditions:\n- At \\(T = 37\\), \\(y = 1\\) (row 1, safe).\n- At \\(T = 38\\), \\(y = 2\\) (row 2, safe as unsafe only at \\(T = 44, 45\\)).\n- At \\(T = 42\\), \\(y = 6\\) (row 6, safe as unsafe only at \\(T = 38\\)).\n- At \\(T = 43\\), \\(y = 7\\) (row 7, safe as unsafe only at \\(T = 37\\)).\n- At \\(T = 44\\), \\(y = 8\\) (row 8, safe as unsafe only at \\(T = 37\\)).\n- At \\(T = 45\\), \\(y = 9\\) (goal, no cars).\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe sequence of actions for turns 36 to 45 (10 actions) is:\n- Turns 36 to 44: \"U\" to move up one row each turn.\n- Turn 45: \"S\" to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis achieves \\(y_{45} = 9\\) (i.e., \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{36 + 10 - 1} = y_{45} = 9\\)) with minimal \\(H = 10\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\, S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 3) at turn t1 = 39. I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, and y=0 and y=9 might be safe zones since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is probably a safe zone, so no cars there. Similarly, y=0 might be safe, but since we start at y=3, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nNow, the car positions are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8. Each car is defined by (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). For left-moving cars, the span is [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h]. In the update, for left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], and for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the car state table, all cars have direction \"right\", so they are all right-moving. Let me confirm:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) — since direction is right, and head is -36, tail is -47, but for right-moving, head should be larger? No.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is given as [τ, h] with τ < h, I think. But here, for freeway 1: h = -36, τ = -47. Since it's right-moving, and τ = -47, h = -36, so τ < h because -47 < -36. So span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) → τ = -41, h = -30, so [-41, -30].\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 same as 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) → all [-41, -30] at t1.\n\nFreeway 6: (60, 25, right, 36) → h=60, τ=25, but for right-moving, should it be [τ, h]? τ=25, h=60, so [25,60] at t1.\n\nBut 25 to 60, that seems odd because cars are moving right, but positions are given, and we care about when they cover x=0.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: (96, 49, right, 48) → τ=49, h=96, so [49,96] at t1.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T. And importantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y at each turn.\n\nThe player update: at each turn, you choose action U, D, or S, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive. So you can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T based on the car on the current y_T, and 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, since we start at y=3 at t1=39, and we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since we need to go from y=3 to y=9, that's 6 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so ideally we go straight up if possible.\n\nFirst, I need to find out for each freeway, when the car covers x=0, so that we avoid being on that freeway when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince the cars are moving, and we care about the time when the span includes 0.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1, so at time T = t1 + Δt, the span for a car on freeway k is:\n\nSince all are right-moving, span at T = [τ_k + s_k * Δt, h_k + s_k * Δt]\n\nAnd 0 is in this interval if τ_k + s_k * Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h_k + s_k * Δt\n\nThat is, the car covers x=0 at time T when this inequality holds.\n\nFor collision, if player is on freeway k at time T, and 0 is in span at T, then collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I can find the times when 0 is covered, i.e., the interval of Δt where the inequality holds.\n\nThen, for each y, the dangerous times are when the car on that y has 0 in span.\n\nBut since each freeway has only one car, and we know the car for each y.\n\nIn this case, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars as given.\n\nSo let's list for each y, the car parameters:\n\n- y=1: car with τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, right-moving\n\n- y=2: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\n- y=3: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6  (same as y=2? But different freeway, so separate car)\n\nFreeway 3 has same parameters as 2, but it's on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: same as y=2 and y=3? Freeway 4: (-30,-41,right,6) — τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nIn the table, for freeway 2,3,4,5 all have (-30,-41,right,6), but freeway 2,3,4,5 are different rows.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1\n\nFreeway 2: k=2\n\nFreeway 3: k=3\n\nFreeway 4: k=4\n\nFreeway 5: k=5\n\nFreeway 6: k=6\n\nFreeway 7: k=7\n\nFreeway 8: k=8\n\nAnd cars:\n\nk=1: (-36,-47,right,12) → τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nk=2: (-30,-41,right,6) → τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nk=3: (-30,-41,right,6) → same as k=2, but on different y\n\nk=4: (-30,-41,right,6) → same\n\nk=5: (-30,-41,right,6) → same\n\nk=6: (60,25,right,36) → h=60, τ=25, s=36\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [25,60]\n\nk=7: (96,49,right,48) → τ=49, h=96, s=48, span [49,96]\n\nk=8: (96,49,right,48) → same as k=7\n\nNow, for each, find when 0 is in span at time T = t1 + Δt.\n\nFor a right-moving car, 0 is in span at T if τ + s * Δt <= 0 <= h + s * Δt\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for Δt.\n\nLet me write the inequality:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n- τ + s Δt <= 0  => s Δt <= -τ  => Δt <= -τ / s  (since s>0)\n\nand\n\n0 <= h + s Δt  => s Δt >= -h  => Δt >= -h / s\n\nAlso, since the car is moving right, and positions can be negative or positive.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, k=1, y=1: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nΔt >= -h / s = -(-36) / 12 = 36/12 = 3\n\nΔt <= -τ / s = -(-47) / 12 = 47/12 ≈ 3.9167\n\nSo Δt from 3 to 47/12 ≈ 3.9167\n\nSince Δt must be integer, because turns are discrete, so Δt = 3 and Δt=4? Let's see.\n\nT = t1 + Δt, Δt integer >=0.\n\nAt Δt=3: τ + s*3 = -47 + 12*3 = -47 + 36 = -11\n\nh + s*3 = -36 + 36 = 0\n\nSo span at T: [ -11, 0 ] , so 0 is included? τ + s Δt = -47 + 12*3 = -11, h + s Δt = -36 + 36 = 0, so span is [-11, 0], so 0 is the right endpoint, which is included, so yes, 0 is in [ -11, 0 ].\n\nAt Δt=4: τ + s*4 = -47 + 48 = 1\n\nh + s*4 = -36 + 48 = 12\n\nSpan [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=2: τ + s*2 = -47 + 24 = -23\n\nh + s*2 = -36 + 24 = -12\n\nSpan [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=1, 0 in span only at Δt=3, i.e., T = t1 + 3 = 39 + 3 = 42\n\nT=42, Δt=3.\n\nNow, k=2, y=2: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-30)/6 = 30/6 = 5\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-41)/6 = 41/6 ≈ 6.8333\n\nAt Δt=5: τ + s*5 = -41 + 30 = -11\n\nh + s*5 = -30 + 30 = 0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=6: τ + s*6 = -41 + 36 = -5\n\nh + s*6 = -30 + 36 = 6, span [-5,6], 0 in since -5 <=0<=6.\n\nAt Δt=7: τ + s*7 = -41 + 42 =1, h + s*7 = -30 + 42 =12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=4: τ + s*4 = -41 + 24 = -17, h + s*4 = -30 + 24 = -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=2, 0 in span at Δt=5 and Δt=6, T=39+5=44 and T=39+6=45.\n\nT=44 and 45.\n\nk=3, y=3: same as k=2, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nSo same times: 0 in span at Δt=5 and Δt=6, T=44 and 45.\n\nk=4, y=4: same as above, T=44 and 45.\n\nk=5, y=5: same, T=44 and 45.\n\nNow k=6, y=6: τ=25, h=60, s=36, right-moving.\n\nτ=25, h=60, s=36\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nτ + s Δt <=0 => 25 + 36 Δt <=0? But 25 >0, and s Δt >=0, so left part 25 + 36 Δt >0 for all Δt>=0, so never <=0? That can't be right.\n\nτ + s Δt <=0 and 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nFirst, τ + s Δt <=0: since τ=25>0, s>0, τ + s Δt >=25 >0 for all Δt>=0, so τ + s Δt <=0 is never true.\n\nTherefore, for k=6, 0 is never in the span because the car is always to the right of 0? At t1, span [25,60], which is all positive, so as time increases, it moves right, so always x>0, never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s Δt is always true since h=60>0, but the first inequality never holds.\n\nSo for y=6, no collision possible, since the car never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, k=7, y=7: τ=49, h=96, s=48\n\nτ=49>0, so τ + s Δt >=49>0, never <=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nk=8, y=8: same, τ=49>0, never covers x=0.\n\nSo only freeways y=1,2,3,4,5 have possible collisions, and y=6,7,8 are always safe since no car covers x=0.\n\ny=1 has collision only at T=42\n\ny=2,3,4,5 have collisions at T=44 and T=45.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at t1=39.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nAlso, y=0 might be safe, but we are at y=3, and need to go up, so probably not going down to y=0.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 up moves, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, we can be there anytime.\n\nThe dangerous parts are when we are on y=1 to y=5 during the times when collision is possible.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- On y=1 at T=42: collision\n\n- On y=2,3,4,5 at T=44 or 45: collision\n\nT=44 and 45 are specific turns.\n\nNow, at t1=39, we are at y=3.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions to move to y=9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous times:\n\nFor y=1: only dangerous at T=42\n\nFor y=2: dangerous at T=44 and 45\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=44 and 45\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=44 and 45\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=44 and 45\n\ny=6,7,8: never dangerous\n\ny=0 and y=9: no cars, safe.\n\nNow, at turn T, the player position y_T depends on previous actions.\n\nWe start at t1=39, y=3.\n\nTurn t1=39: we are at y=3.\n\nNow, we choose action for turn t1, which affects y at t1+1.\n\nLet me define the turn index.\n\nSet t=0 corresponding to t1, so at time step t=0: turn t1=39, y=3\n\nThen after action a_0, we go to y_1 at t=1 (which is turn t1+1=40)\n\nGenerally, at time t (relative), turn is t1 + t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on y_t and the car on that y at that turn.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + t, we are at position y_t, and we check if for freeway k=y_t, 0 is in span at T.\n\nIf so, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen we choose action a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H, minimal.\n\nSince we start at y=3 and need to go to y=9, the minimal number of moves is 6 if we go straight up, but we might need to wait.\n\nFirst, let's see if straight up is possible.\n\nSuppose we always go up: actions all U.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0 (turn 39): y=3, action U\n\nt=1 (turn 40): y=4, action U? After action at t, we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=0: position y_0=3, choose a_0=U, then y_1 = y_0 +1 =4 at turn t1+1=40\n\nThen at turn 40, position y=4, now check collision: at turn 40, Δt=40-39=1, for y=4, car has τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nSpan at T=40: τ + s*1 = -41 +6= -35, h + s*1= -30+6= -24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action a_1=U, y_2=5 at turn 41\n\nTurn 41: y=5, Δt=2, for y=5 car: τ + s*2= -41 +12= -29, h + s*2= -30 +12= -18, span [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=6 at turn 42\n\nTurn 42: y=6, but y=6 is always safe, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=7 at turn 43\n\nTurn 43: y=7, safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=8 at turn 44\n\nTurn 44: y=8, safe.\n\na_5=U, y_6=9 at turn 45\n\nNow at turn 45, y=9, which is the goal, and since y=9 has no cars, safe.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn 45, with H=6 steps? Let's see the turns.\n\nWe started at t=0 (turn 39), after 6 actions, at t=6, turn 45, y=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=5.\n\nSequence: from t=0 to t=5, actions U each time.\n\nNow check for collision during the path:\n\nAt turn 39 (t=0): y=3, Δt=0, for y=3 car: span at t1 is [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 40 (t=1): y=4, Δt=1, span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 41 (t=2): y=5, Δt=2, span [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 42 (t=3): y=6, safe.\n\nTurn 43 (t=4): y=7, safe.\n\nTurn 44 (t=5): y=8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 45, after action at turn 44, we go to y=9, but at turn 45, when we are at y=9, we don't care about cars, or do we?\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nAt turn 45, we are at y=9, which has no car, so no collision.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at turn 45.\n\nBut is turn 45 the turn when we arrive? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, then we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 45, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so when y_T =9 for some T, we are done.\n\nIn this case, at turn 45, y=9, so we have reached.\n\nNow, what about the dangerous turns? For example, at turn 42, we were on y=6, which is safe, not on y=1.\n\nAt turn 44, we were on y=8, safe, not on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=3 is dangerous at T=44, but in this path, at T=44, we are on y=8, not on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=42, on y=6, not on y=1.\n\nSo straight up seems possible with H=6.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart: turn 39, position y=3, we choose action for turn 39.\n\nAfter action, we move to new position at turn 40.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 39: at y=3, choose a_{t1} = a_{39}, say U, then to y=4 at turn 40.\n\nTurn 40: at y=4, choose U, to y=5 at 41.\n\nTurn 41: at y=5, choose U, to y=6 at 42.\n\nTurn 42: at y=6, choose U, to y=7 at 43.\n\nTurn 43: at y=7, choose U, to y=8 at 44.\n\nTurn 44: at y=8, choose U, to y=9 at 45.\n\nAt turn 45, we are at y=9, so we stop.\n\nH=6 turns: from turn 39 to turn 44, we take 6 actions, and at turn 45 we are at position.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, we reach at turn t1+H.\n\nIn this case, t1=39, H=6, so actions from turn 39 to 44, and at turn 45, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut we need to make sure no collision during the path.\n\nIn the above, at each turn, when we were on y=3,4,5, it was before the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at turn 39: y=3, Δt=0, safe.\n\nTurn 40: y=4, Δt=1, safe.\n\nTurn 41: y=5, Δt=2, safe.\n\nThen turn 42: y=6, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut what about if we were on y=3 at later time? But in this path, we left early.\n\nNow, is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since we can reach in 6.\n\nBut let me check if at some point we might be forced to wait.\n\nFor example, suppose we didn't move at some point.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut I recall that for y=1, it was dangerous at T=42, but we are not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3, dangerous at T=44 and 45, but at T=44 we are on y=8, not y=3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? From y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 steps, so H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut can we do it in less? No, because we need to increase y by 6, each up move increases by 1, so minimum 6 actions.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per up.\n\nSo H=6 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me double-check the car for y=3.\n\nAt turn 39, y=3: Δt=0, span [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 40, if we stay, but we didn't.\n\nSuppose at some point we go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for each turn.\n\nNow, the player position: at turn 39, we start at (0,3), then after action.\n\nIn the collision note, it says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, since we move each time, but we are only concerned with the current y at each turn.\n\nIn our path, we are never on a dangerous y at dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at turn 44, if we were on y=5, it would be dangerous, but we are on y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 42, y=1 is dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nAnother thing: the cars on y=2,3,4,5 all have the same parameters, so dangerous at same times.\n\nBut in our path, we avoid those y during T=44-45.\n\nNow, what about y=0? But we don't need to go there.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But we start at y=3, need to go to y=9, minimum 6 steps.\n\nUnless we can go up faster, but no.\n\nSo I think H=6 with all U is fine.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t1 = 39: action U\n\nThen at turn 40, y=4, action U\n\nTurn 41, y=5, action U\n\nTurn 42, y=6, action U\n\nTurn 43, y=7, action U\n\nTurn 44, y=8, action U\n\nThen at turn 45, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions from turn 39 to 44.\n\nH=6 turns: turns 39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nAfter action at turn 44, we go to y=9 at turn 45.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\n}\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision at turn 42 for y=1.\n\nAt turn 42, if someone is on y=1, collision, but we are on y=6, fine.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 44, y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous, but we are on y=8.\n\nAt turn 45, same.\n\nBut turn 45 we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can reach in fewer than 6, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is at turn t1, and we need to reach by some turn.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nBut let me check the car for y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6: car at [25,60] at t1, moving right, so at later times, even more right, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly y=7 and 8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, at turn 41, we were on it, but Δt=2, span [-29,-18], not covering 0.\n\nOnly at Δt=5 and 6, which are turns 44 and 45.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and in this case H=6.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H<6? No.\n\nPerhaps if we go up faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: can we reach y=9 earlier by starting from a different action?\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nOr if we stay still, but that increases H.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\n}\n\nIn the box, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo Turn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 44: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 45, position is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at turn 39 we stay, S.\n\nThen at turn 39: y=3, safe, action S, then at turn 40, still y=3.\n\nBut at turn 40, y=3, Δt=1, for car: τ + s*1 = -41 +6= -35, h + s*1= -30+6= -24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen we can go up later, but it would take more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we stay at turn 39, then at turn 40 y=3, then go up, but we reach later.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, minimal is straight up.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 1, it was dangerous only at T=42, but we didn't encounter it.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 39\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Freeway \\(y = 1\\)**: Car with tail \\(\\tau = -47\\), head \\(h = -36\\), speed \\(s = 12\\), direction right.  \n  The car covers \\(x = 0\\) only at turn \\(T = 42\\) (relative time \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).  \n  Hazardous at turn 42.\n\n- **Freeway \\(y = 2\\)**: Car with tail \\(\\tau = -41\\), head \\(h = -30\\), speed \\(s = 6\\), direction right.  \n  The car covers \\(x = 0\\) at turns \\(T = 44\\) and \\(T = 45\\) (relative times \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 6\\)).  \n  Hazardous at turns 44 and 45.\n\n- **Freeway \\(y = 3\\)**: Car with tail \\(\\tau = -41\\), head \\(h = -30\\), speed \\(s = 6\\), direction right.  \n  The car covers \\(x = 0\\) at turns \\(T = 44\\) and \\(T = 45\\) (relative times \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 6\\)).  \n  Hazardous at turns 44 and 45.\n\n- **Freeway \\(y = 4\\)**: Car with tail \\(\\tau = -41\\), head \\(h = -30\\), speed \\(s = 6\\), direction right.  \n  The car covers \\(x = 0\\) at turns \\(T = 44\\) and \\(T = 45\\) (relative times \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 6\\)).  \n  Hazardous at turns 44 and 45.\n\n- **Freeway \\(y = 5\\)**: Car with tail \\(\\tau = -41\\), head \\(h = -30\\), speed \\(s = 6\\), direction right.  \n  The car covers \\(x = 0\\) at turns \\(T = 44\\) and \\(T = 45\\) (relative times \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 6\\)).  \n  Hazardous at turns 44 and 45.\n\n- **Freeway \\(y = 6\\)**: Car with tail \\(\\tau = 25\\), head \\(h = 60\\), speed \\(s = 36\\), direction right.  \n  The car is always at \\(x > 0\\) and never covers \\(x = 0\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 42 and the player starts at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical). The grid has y from 0 to 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, and k in [1,8]) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway k has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) at the same turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves from freeway k to k' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on k (and will be on k' at the next turn). So at turn T, we check the freeway the player is currently on (which is k) and the cars on that freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (which is 42). For each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have a car described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost part and tail the leftmost? But the update rules are given:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: the example in the problem for left-moving is not given. Actually, the given cars are all right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving cars: \n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, the head is the front (which is the larger x if moving right?) Actually, the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h] meaning from tail to head, and when moving right, the entire car moves right.\n\nBut in the data, for freeway 1: head=48, tail=37 -> so the car is from 37 to 48? Then at time t1 (42) the car is at [37,48]. Then at time T, it will be [37 + 12*(T-42), 48 + 12*(T-42)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> tail=-59, head=-48? Then the car at t1 is at [-59,-48]. Then at time T, it will be [-59 + 6*(T-42), -48 + 6*(T-42)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, k) at turn T, and 0 must be in the span of the car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions from turn t1 (42) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 (at turn t1=42). We want to go to y=9. We have to avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at turns when the car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). So the minimal number of turns without obstacles would be 9 (because we start at 0 and need to go to 9, so 9 moves up). But we have obstacles.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 42) the position of the car and whether 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car movements relative to turn 42.\n\nFor a freeway k, the car's span at time T (relative to t1=42) is:\n\nLet dt = T - 42.\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   tail(T) = tail0 + s * dt\n   head(T) = head0 + s * dt\n\nSo the span is [tail0 + s*dt, head0 + s*dt]\n\n0 is in the span if: tail0 + s*dt <= 0 <= head0 + s*dt.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving (none in this problem) it would be [head0 - s*dt, tail0 - s*dt] and then we check if 0 is in [head0 - s*dt, tail0 - s*dt] (but note: head0 is the larger and tail0 the smaller? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. Since h > τ (because head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost) then the interval [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] is actually [rightmost - s*dt, leftmost - s*dt] and then we have to check if 0 is between τ - s*dt and h - s*dt? But note: the interval [a,b] when a>b is not standard. Actually, the problem writes [h, τ] for left-moving? But then if h is the head (rightmost) and τ the tail (leftmost), then the interval should be [τ, h] for the positions? But the problem writes [h, τ] for left-moving? This seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \n- Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. But if h is the head (the larger coordinate) and τ the tail (the smaller), then the car is from τ to h. So the interval [h, τ] doesn't make sense because h>τ. So I think the problem means the interval from τ to h, but they wrote [h,τ] which is backwards? \n\nHowever, in the problem statement for right-moving they wrote [τ, h] and for left-moving [h, τ]. And then they update by subtracting for left and adding for right. But the interval representation should be such that the first number is the left end and the second the right end? Actually, no: in an interval [a,b] we assume a<=b. But in the right-moving, [τ, h] with τ<=h? And in left-moving, [h, τ] with h>=τ? Then that would be a backwards interval. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean the endpoints without ordering? But then the update is linear. \n\nI think the safe way is to interpret the car's span as the set of x-coordinates that the car occupies. For a right-moving car, at t1: the car occupies from τ to h (with τ <= h). Then at T: it occupies from τ + s*(T-t1) to h + s*(T-t1). Similarly, for left-moving: from h - s*(T-t1) to τ - s*(T-t1) but note that if h>τ, then after subtracting, h-s*(T-t1) > τ-s*(T-t1) and the car would be from τ-s*(T-t1) to h-s*(T-t1). So actually, the problem's representation for left-moving is confusing because [h,τ] with h>τ is not standard. \n\nBut in our problem, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have to worry about left-moving.\n\nSo for each car (all right-moving) on freeway k:\n\nWe have:\n  tail0 = given as the first number in the pair? \n  head0 = the second number.\n\nBut wait: for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> the car is described as (head, tail). But the update rule for right-moving uses (τ, h) meaning (tail, head). So in the table, the first number is head and the second is tail? Then for freeway1: head0=48, tail0=37? But then the car at t1 is [37,48]? \n\nBut the update rule says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h] -> [37,48]? Then at time T: [37+12*(T-42), 48+12*(T-42)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> head0=-48, tail0=-59? Then the car at t1 is at [-59,-48]. Then at time T: [-59+6*(T-42), -48+6*(T-42)].\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on freeway k at turn T if 0 is in [tail0 + s*(T-42), head0 + s*(T-42)].\n\nSo for each freeway k, we can compute the times (turns) when the car covers 0.\n\nWe'll do that for each freeway:\n\nLet dt = T - 42.\n\nCondition for freeway k at time T:\n   tail0 + s * dt <= 0 <= head0 + s * dt\n\nBut note: if the car is moving right, then tail0 < head0? Actually, for freeway1: tail0=37, head0=48 -> 37<=48, so tail0<=head0. For freeway2: tail0=-59, head0=-48 -> -59<=-48, so tail0<=head0.\n\nSo condition: \n   tail0 + s*dt <= 0 <= head0 + s*dt\n\nWe can solve for dt:\n\n   tail0 + s*dt <= 0   =>   dt >= ceil( (-tail0) / s )? But note: if tail0 is negative, then (-tail0) is positive.\n\nBut actually, we have two inequalities:\n\n  1. tail0 + s*dt <= 0   =>   s*dt <= -tail0   =>   dt <= (-tail0) / s   ??? Wait: no, because if we have A <= B, then adding -A to both sides: 0 <= B - A.\n\nBut note: we have two conditions:\n\n   tail0 + s*dt <= 0   =>   dt >= ceil( (-tail0) / s )   ??? \n\nWait: let me rearrange:\n\n   s*dt <= -tail0\n\nBut if s>0, then:\n\n   dt <= (-tail0) / s\n\nBut note: if tail0 is negative, then -tail0 is positive, so dt must be <= a positive number.\n\nBut wait: that doesn't make sense because as time increases, the car moves right. For example, freeway1: tail0=37, head0=48. Then at dt=0, the car is at [37,48] which is positive. Then condition: 37 + 12*dt <= 0 -> 12*dt <= -37 -> dt <= -37/12 -> which is negative. So never? \n\nSimilarly, the second condition: 0 <= 48 + 12*dt -> dt >= -48/12 = -4. So for freeway1, the car covers 0 only for dt in [-4, -37/12]? But dt>=0, so no overlap. So freeway1 never covers 0 for T>=42.\n\nLet me check: at T=42, the car is at [37,48]. Then as time goes, it moves right. So it will never cover 0 (which is to the left). So freeway1 is safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: tail0=-59, head0=-48. Then condition:\n\n   -59 + 6*dt <= 0   =>   6*dt <= 59   =>   dt <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> so dt from 0 to 9 (inclusive of integers) satisfies the first inequality.\n\n   and 0 <= -48 + 6*dt   =>   6*dt >= 48   =>   dt >= 8.\n\nSo for dt in [8, 9.833] -> so dt=8,9.\n\nSo at T = 42+8 = 50 and T=42+9=51, the car on freeway2 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same as freeway2? The table says for freeway3: (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as freeway2. So also dangerous at T=50 and 51.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway2 -> dangerous at T=50,51.\n\nFreeway5: same -> dangerous at T=50,51.\n\nFreeway6: (-48,-83,right,36) -> tail0=-83, head0=-48, s=36.\n\nCondition1: -83 + 36*dt <= 0 -> 36*dt <= 83 -> dt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> so dt=0,1,2.\nCondition2: 0 <= -48 + 36*dt -> 36*dt >= 48 -> dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.\n\nSo dt in [1.333, 2.305] -> dt=2 only? (since dt is integer). So at T=42+2=44.\n\nFreeway7: (-48,-95,right,48) -> tail0=-95, head0=-48, s=48.\n\nCondition1: -95 + 48*dt <= 0 -> 48*dt <= 95 -> dt <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> dt=0,1.\nCondition2: 0 <= -48 + 48*dt -> 48*dt >= 48 -> dt>=1.\n\nSo dt=1 -> T=42+1=43.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> so also dangerous at T=43.\n\nSummary of dangerous (freeway, turn) pairs:\n\n- Freeway2: T=50,51\n- Freeway3: T=50,51\n- Freeway4: T=50,51\n- Freeway5: T=50,51\n- Freeway6: T=44\n- Freeway7: T=43\n- Freeway8: T=43\n\nNote: freeway1 is safe at all times.\n\nOur plan: we start at turn42 at y=0. We want to go to y=9.\n\nWe can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when (k,T) is dangerous as above.\n\nBut note: we don't have to avoid freeways that are not dangerous at that turn. For example, freeway1 is always safe.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but since each move is cost 1, we can do BFS) over states (turn, y). The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=42) and y in [0,9]. We want the minimal turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut note: the turn index increases, and we start at t=42, y=0. The goal is to have y=9.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But note: if we are at y=0, we cannot go down. Similarly, at y=9, we stop.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways 1 to 8. When we are at y=k (where k in [1,8]) at turn T, we must check if (k,T) is dangerous (as computed above). If it is, then we cannot be at that state.\n\nNote: when we are at y=0 or y=9, we are not on any freeway (freeways are y=1..8), so no collision.\n\nWe start at (42,0). We want to reach (T,9) for some T>=42.\n\nWe'll simulate the state space for turns from 42 up to ...? We know the dangerous events happen at T=43,44,50,51. We can set a bound. Since the minimal steps without obstacles is 9, but we might have to wait, so let's say we go up to 60.\n\nWe'll generate states:\n\nAt each state (t, y), we consider the next actions: U, D, S (if applicable). Then we get:\n\n  if U: y_next = y+1 (if y<9)\n  if D: y_next = y-1 (if y>0)\n  if S: y_next = y\n\nThen we move to state (t+1, y_next) provided that:\n\n  - If y_next is in [1,8] at turn t+1, then we must check that (freeway k=y_next, turn T=t+1) is not dangerous.\n\nBut note: at the moment of the move: \n  At turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action. At the next turn (t+1), we are at y_next. And at that turn t+1, we are on freeway y_next (if y_next in [1,8]) and we check the car on that freeway at turn t+1.\n\nAlso note: we are not on the freeway at the starting turn? Actually, when we start at turn 42 at y=0, we are safe. Then at turn 43, we will be at some y (if we move up to y=1, then we are on freeway1 at turn43). But we computed that freeway1 is always safe, so that would be okay? However, freeway7 and 8 are dangerous at turn43.\n\nSo if at turn43 we are on freeway7 or 8, we crash. But we start at y=0. The moves:\n\nAt turn42: we are at (42,0). Then we choose an action. We can go to:\n\n  U: y=1 at turn43 -> freeway1 at turn43: safe (freeway1 always safe) -> state (43,1)\n  D: not allowed (y=0)\n  S: y=0 at turn43 -> state (43,0) -> safe (y=0)\n\nSo from (42,0) we have two options: (43,1) and (43,0).\n\nNow, from (43,1): we are at turn43, y=1. Then we can move:\n\n  U: y=2 at turn44 -> freeway2 at turn44: we have to check. We computed freeway2 dangerous at T=50,51 -> so at 44 it's safe? -> state (44,2)\n  D: y=0 at turn44 -> safe (y=0) -> state (44,0)\n  S: y=1 at turn44 -> freeway1 at turn44: safe -> state (44,1)\n\nBut wait: at turn44, freeway6 is dangerous. But if we go to freeway6? That would be y=6 at turn44 -> dangerous. But we are not going to y=6 at turn44 from (43,1) in one move? We can only move to y=0,1,2.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut we have to avoid being at freeway6 at turn44. So if we ever get to y=6 at turn44, we crash.\n\nSimilarly, at turn43, we must avoid being at freeway7 or 8. So if we had chosen to go to y=7 or 8 at turn43, that would crash. But from (42,0) we can only go to y=1 at turn43 (if we go up) or stay at 0. So we avoid freeway7 and 8 at turn43.\n\nNow, we must plan until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll do a BFS. Since the grid is small (10 y-values) and time we can bound, we can do it.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet time_start = 42.\n\nWe want to compute the minimal steps to reach y=9.\n\nWe'll maintain:\n\n  dist[t][y] = minimal number of steps (turns) taken to reach (t,y) from (42,0). But note: we care about the sequence of actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do a BFS by increasing turn.\n\nWe note that the dangerous times are only at 43,44,50,51. So beyond 51, the freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous only at 50,51, and freeway6 at 44, freeway7,8 at 43. So after turn51, freeways 2,3,4,5 become safe again? \n\nBut let me check freeway2: at T=52: \n  tail = -59 + 6*(52-42) = -59 + 60 = 1\n  head = -48 + 60 = 12\n  So at T=52, the car is at [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0? So safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=53: [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo after T=51, freeway2 is safe. Similarly for freeway3,4,5.\n\nFreeway6: after T=44: \n  T=45: tail = -83 + 36*(45-42)= -83 + 108 = 25, head=-48+108=60 -> safe.\n  So freeway6 is safe after 44.\n\nFreeway7: after T=43: \n  T=44: tail = -95 + 48*(44-42) = -95 + 96 = 1, head=-48+96=48 -> safe.\n  So safe after 43.\n\nTherefore, beyond T=51, there are no more dangerous events.\n\nSo we can set a time bound: we know that without obstacles we can do 9 moves. With obstacles, we might have to wait a few turns. The worst waiting might be until after the dangerous events? The last dangerous event is at T=51. So we can set the time bound to 60.\n\nWe'll do BFS over time from 42 to 60.\n\nBut note: we want the minimal H (number of turns) to reach y=9. H is the number of actions, which is the same as the number of turns from 42 to the arrival turn (exclusive of 42? inclusive?).\n\nActually, at turn42 we start. Then we take an action at turn42, then at turn43, ... until we take an action at turn (42+H-1) and then at the next turn (42+H) we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t=0 to H-1: so actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at the next state. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? Actually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we require that after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the player's position becomes 9 at that same turn? \n\nWait, the update: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n  a_{t1} (at t=0), a_{t1+1} (at t=1), ... a_{t1+H-1} (at t=H-1).\n\nThen the player position after the last action: \n  We start at t1: y_{t1}=0.\n  After a_{t1}: at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n  ...\n  After a_{t1+H-1}: at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut the problem requires: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" ? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we require that at the turn when we take the last action (which is turn t1+H-1), the player is at 9? \n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}. Then we update to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy. \n\nBut the requirement is that at the start of the turn? or after the action? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So at the start of turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9. Then we take an action? But if we are at 9, we can only go down or stay? But we want to be at 9 at the end? \n\nWait, let me read: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". And the update rule: we update after the action. \n\nBut the condition for the goal is: we require that the last state (after the last action) is (0,9). But the problem states: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis seems ambiguous. Let me check: \n\nThe sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. Then the position at the end of the sequence (i.e., at the moment after the last action) would be at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nI think there might be an off-by-one. \n\nLooking at the update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo to have y_{t} = 9 at some turn t, we must have taken an action at turn t-1 that led to 9? \n\nBut the problem says: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo at the turn t1+H-1 (which is the last action turn), we have the player's position at the start of the turn? Then we take an action and then we update to a new position? \n\nBut the requirement is that at the start of that turn, the player is at 9? Then we take an action? But if we take an action at 9, we might go to 8 (if we go down) or stay at 9 (if we choose S or U? but U would go to 10 which is invalid). \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action, the player is at 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nI think the problem means that at the turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9. But note: the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we become y_{t+1}. \n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of a turn, we must have been brought there by the previous action? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence. \n\nI think the problem's requirement is: we take H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? \n\nBut that would mean that we are at 9 at the start of the last action turn, then we take an action and then we leave 9? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might want that after the last action, we are at 9. Then the last action would be taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we become y_{t1+H} = 9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLooking at the example output format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then we require that the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9. \n\nBut note: the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn. Then we take a_{t1+H-1} and then we become y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have been at 9 at the start of that turn. Then we take an action. But we want to be at 9 at the end? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the update: after an action at turn t, we get the next state at turn t+1.\n\nSo the goal is to have y_{t} = 9 for some t. And we are free to choose when to stop. But the problem requires that the last action in the sequence is taken at the turn when we are about to leave? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take the last action a_{t1+H-1} and then we become y_{t1+H} which could be 8,9, or 10 (but 10 is invalid). \n\nBut we don't require anything about y_{t1+H}. We only require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean we have reached the goal at the end of the sequence? \n\nI think there is an inconsistency. \n\nLooking again: \"reach (0,9)\" and the position is (0,y). So we want the player to be at (0,9). \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo it requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9. Then we take an action and then we move to 8,9, or 10. \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the end. \n\nI think the problem means that we are at 9 after the entire sequence. \n\nBut the entire sequence of H actions takes us from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and then we are at the state at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H, we must have: \n  y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd we took actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nSo the requirement should be y_{t1+H} = 9. \n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nI suspect a typo. \n\nLooking at the problem: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" and the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: so the last action is at t1+H-1, and then the next state is at t1+H. \n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at some state. The problem says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\", meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis would mean that we are at 9 at the start of the last action turn. Then we take an action and then we leave. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense for the goal. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action, we are at 9. \n\nI think it's more reasonable to assume that the goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the end of the sequence of actions, i.e., at turn t1+H, we are at y=9. \n\nAnd the minimal H such that there exists a sequence of H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1) that leads to y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll follow the problem's requirement: we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9. Then we take the last action a_{t1+H-1} (which could be S to stay, or U to go to 10 which is invalid, or D to go to 8). \n\nBut we are only required to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn, not necessarily after the action. \n\nAnd then we output the sequence of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nBut note: the initial state is at turn t1: we are at (0,0). So at turn t1, we are at y=0. Then we take a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1, we are at y1. \n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y1. Then we take a_{t1+1} and so on. \n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, that means we are at 9 at the start of that turn, and then we take the last action. \n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at some point. And we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we can choose to then take an action that leaves 9, but we have already been at 9. \n\nHowever, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", so once we are at 9, we have reached. \n\nBut note: we might be at 9 earlier and then leave? \n\nBut the requirement is only to be at 9 at the specific turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut we want the minimal H. \n\nAlternatively, we can stop as soon as we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem requires that the last action in the sequence is at turn t1+H-1 and at the beginning of that turn we are at 9. \n\nSo we might have been at 9 earlier, but then we left and then came back? \n\nThat doesn't make sense for minimal H. \n\nI think the problem likely means that after the last action we are at 9. But the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nTo resolve, I'll assume that the requirement is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we output the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nThen, after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we become y_{t1+H} which may not be 9. But that's acceptable because the goal is to have been at 9 at the start of that turn. \n\nBut note: the goal is to reach (0,9) and then presumably we win. But the problem doesn't specify that we have to stay. \n\nSo I'll go with the problem's statement: we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9. \n\nTherefore, in our BFS, we are looking for a state (t, y) with y=9, and t = t1 + (some number of turns). \n\nBut note: the actions are taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and the state at turn t1 is (0,0), and the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\nThe number of actions is H, and the number of state updates is H, so we go from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, which means we have advanced H-1 turns? \n\nLet me clarify the turns:\n\n  Turn t1: start at (0,0) -> before any action.\n  Action at turn t1: then we get to turn t1+1.\n  ...\n  After k actions, we are at turn t1+k.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. How many actions have been taken? The actions taken are at turns: t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-2? \n\nLet's count:\n\n  Action 0: at turn t1, then we are at turn t1+1.\n  Action 1: at turn t1+1, then we are at turn t1+2.\n  ...\n  Action H-1: at turn t1+H-1, then we are at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (before the last action) we are at 9. \n\nSo the last action is taken when we are at 9. \n\nTherefore, the number of actions is H, and the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and at that moment (before the action) we are at 9. \n\nSo in the state (turn, y), we are looking for states with y=9 and turn>=42, and we want the minimal H such that H = (turn - 42) + 1? \n\nLet me define: \n  Let T = turn.\n  We are at state (T, 9).\n  The number of turns elapsed since the start (excluding the start) is T - 42.\n  The number of actions taken is also T - 42? \n\nBut we start at turn42. Then at turn43, we have taken 1 action.\n  ...\n  At turn T, we have taken T-42 actions.\n\nBut we require that at turn T, we are at 9, and then we take the last action (which is the (T-42)-th action) at turn T. \n\nBut then the number of actions H = T - 42.\n\nAnd then we output actions for turns 42,43,...,T-1? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1: \n  a_{42}, a_{43}, ..., a_{42+H-1}\n\nIf H = T - 42, then the last action is at 42+H-1 = 42 + (T-42) - 1 = T-1.\n\nBut we are at state (T,9) at the beginning of turn T. How did we get there? By an action taken at turn T-1. \n\nSo the actions are taken at turns: 42,43,...,T-1. That's (T-42) actions. \n\nTherefore, H = T-42.\n\nAnd we require that at the beginning of turn T, we are at 9. \n\nSo in our BFS, we are looking for the minimal T>=42 such that we can be at (T,9) and T-42 is minimal? But we want minimal H, and H = T-42. So minimal T gives minimal H.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple ways to get to 9 at different T, and we want the smallest H (which is T-42).\n\nSo we do a BFS over (t,y) for t from 42 to ? and we want to find the minimal t such that y=9.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid states that are dangerous: if at a state (t,y) we have y in [1,8] and (y,t) is in the dangerous set, then we cannot be there.\n\nIn our case, the dangerous states are:\n\n  (43,7), (43,8) -> because freeway7 and 8 are dangerous at turn43.\n  (44,6) -> freeway6 at turn44.\n  (50,2), (50,3), (50,4), (50,5) -> freeways2-5 at turn50.\n  (51,2), (51,3), (51,4), (51,5) -> freeways2-5 at turn51.\n\nAnd note: if we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe start at (42,0). We want to reach (T,9) for some T>=42, and we want minimal T.\n\nThen H = T-42.\n\nWe'll do a BFS:\n\n  Let's use a queue: (t, y, path) but we don't need to store the path if we only care about minimal T, but we need to output the actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can store the parent information.\n\nBut since the grid is small (t up to 60, y in 0..9), we can do a BFS that stores the distance and the path.\n\nBut storing the entire path might be heavy, but 60 states is fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can store for each (t,y) the previous state and the action taken.\n\nWe'll create:\n\n  dist[t][y] = minimal number of actions taken to reach (t,y) from (42,0) (which is 0 actions at (42,0))? \n  But note: at (42,0) we haven't taken any action. We will take an action to move to the next state.\n\nWe want to reach (t,9) and then the number of actions taken is the number of actions from 42 to t-1, so that's (t-42) actions.\n\nBut we start at (42,0) and then we take an action at turn42 to go to (43,y1). \n\nSo we can consider the state (t,y) as the state at the beginning of turn t.\n\nWe initialize:\n   dist[42][0] = 0, and no actions yet.\n\nThen from state (t,y), we consider the actions: U, D, S.\n\nThe next state is (t+1, y') where y' = y+1 (U, if y<9), y-1 (D, if y>0), or y (S).\n\nAnd we can only go to (t+1, y') if:\n\n   - y' is in [0,9]\n   - if y' is in [1,8], then (y', t+1) must not be a dangerous pair.\n\nBut note: the state (t+1, y') is the state at the beginning of turn t+1. And if y' is in [1,8], then we check if at turn t+1, freeway y' is dangerous? \n\nBut the dangerous pairs are (freeway, turn) -> so we check (y', t+1).\n\nAlso, if y' is 0 or 9, then safe.\n\nWe want to find the minimal t such that we have (t,9) reached.\n\nThen the number of actions H = t - 42.\n\nAnd the actions are the ones taken at turns: 42, 43, ..., t-1.\n\nWe'll use a BFS:\n\n  Let Q be a queue.\n  We start: (42,0) with dist=0 and no actions.\n\n  Then we consider all actions from (42,0): \n        U: y_next = 1 -> state (43,1): is (1,43) dangerous? freeway1 is always safe -> so we can go.\n        D: invalid (y=0)\n        S: y_next=0 -> state (43,0): safe.\n\n  Then from (43,1): actions: U->2, D->0, S->1. Then we check (44,2): freeway2 at turn44: safe? because freeway2 dangerous only at 50,51 -> safe.\n          (44,0): safe.\n          (44,1): safe.\n\n  We continue until we reach a state (t,9).\n\n  We want the first t (minimal) for which we get to 9.\n\n  But note: we might have multiple paths. We want the minimal t.\n\n  We can break when we first reach (t,9) because BFS by time (which is increasing) will find the minimal t.\n\n  We'll iterate by increasing t.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll create an array for t from 42 to 60 (or 70) for y from 0 to 9.\n\n  Let visited[t][y] = whether we have visited (t,y) and the minimal distance (which is t-42) is the number of actions.\n\n  We start by setting visited[42][0]=true, with no actions.\n\n  Then for t from 42 to 60:\n        for each y in [0,9]:\n            if visited[t][y] is true, then we consider actions from (t,y) to (t+1, y_next) for y_next in { y-1, y, y+1 } (if in bounds).\n\n        and then if the new state (t+1, y_next) is not dangerous (if y_next in [1,8] then check if (y_next, t+1) is not in the dangerous set) and not visited, then we add it.\n\n  We stop when we visit (t,9) for the first time.\n\nDangerous set:\n\n  dangerous(t, y) = true if y in [1,8] and (y,t) is one of:\n      (7,43), (8,43),\n      (6,44),\n      (2,50), (3,50), (4,50), (5,50),\n      (2,51), (3,51), (4,51), (5,51)\n\nBut wait: freeway2 is y=2, so (2,50) and (2,51) are dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 is y=3, etc.\n\nSo we can precompute a set:\n\n   bad = { (43,7), (43,8), (44,6), (50,2), (50,3), (50,4), (50,5), (51,2), (51,3), (51,4), (51,5) }\n\n   Then when we consider (t+1, y_next), if (t+1, y_next) is in bad, then skip.\n\nBut note: the state is (t+1, y_next), and we are at the beginning of turn t+1. And if (t+1, y_next) is in bad, then we crash.\n\nSo we skip that state.\n\nNow, let's simulate:\n\n   t=42: only (42,0) visited.\n\n   t=43: \n        from (42,0): \n            U -> (43,1): not in bad? bad has (43,7) and (43,8) -> so safe.\n            S -> (43,0): safe.\n\n        So we have (43,0) and (43,1).\n\n   t=44:\n        from (43,0): \n            U -> (44,1): safe? bad: (44,6) -> safe.\n            S -> (44,0): safe.\n            D: not allowed.\n        from (43,1):\n            U -> (44,2): safe (bad: (44,6) -> so 2 is safe)\n            D -> (44,0): already visited? we can mark it again? but we are doing BFS by time, so we don't care about revisiting? Actually, we want the first time we get to (t,y). But if we get to (t,y) by two paths, then we want the minimal time. But time increases monotonically, so if we are at (44,0) from (43,0) and also from (43,1), then both have the same time. So we can mark it as visited at time 44.\n\n        So states at 44: (44,0), (44,1), (44,2)\n\n   t=45: \n        from (44,0): \n            U-> (45,1)\n            S-> (45,0)\n        from (44,1):\n            U-> (45,2)\n            D-> (45,0) -> already in the list? \n            S-> (45,1)\n        from (44,2):\n            U-> (45,3)\n            D-> (45,1)\n            S-> (45,2)\n\n        So states: (45,0), (45,1), (45,2), (45,3)\n\n   We continue. We want to get to 9.\n\n   How fast can we go up? \n        We can try to go up every turn. \n        Start at 42:0 -> 43:1 -> 44:2 -> 45:3 -> 46:4 -> 47:5 -> 48:6 -> 49:7 -> 50:8 -> 51:9.\n\n        But wait: at turn50, if we are at y=8, then we are not on a dangerous freeway? The dangerous freeways at turn50 are y=2,3,4,5 -> so y=8 is safe.\n\n        Then at turn51: we go to 9.\n\n        So we would reach (51,9). \n\n        Then H = 51 - 42 = 9.\n\n        And the actions: \n          from 42:0 to 43:1 -> U\n          43:1 to 44:2 -> U\n          44:2 to 45:3 -> U\n          45:3 to 46:4 -> U\n          46:4 to 47:5 -> U\n          47:5 to 48:6 -> U -> but wait: at turn48, we go to y=6. Then at turn48, we are at y=6. Then next turn49: we go to y=7 -> then turn50: y=8 -> turn51: y=9.\n\n        But at turn48: we are at (48,6). Is that dangerous? \n          Dangerous events: freeway6 only at turn44 -> so safe.\n\n        At turn49: (49,7) -> freeway7 dangerous only at turn43 -> safe.\n        At turn50: (50,8) -> freeways2-5 dangerous at 50, but 8 is safe.\n        At turn51: (51,9) -> safe.\n\n        So we can go straight up in 9 actions: from turn42 to turn50 (inclusive) we take 9 actions? \n          Actions: \n            turn42: U -> to y=1 at turn43\n            turn43: U -> to y=2 at turn44\n            turn44: U -> to y=3 at turn45\n            turn45: U -> to y=4 at turn46\n            turn46: U -> to y=5 at turn47\n            turn47: U -> to y=6 at turn48\n            turn48: U -> to y=7 at turn49\n            turn49: U -> to y=8 at turn50\n            turn50: U -> to y=9 at turn51\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn51, we are at y=9? \n\n        But note: at the beginning of turn50, we are at y=8. Then we take an action U at turn50, and then at turn51 we become y=9. \n\n        But the requirement is to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn51? \n\n        Then we have reached (51,9). \n\n        And the last action is at turn50. \n\n        The sequence of actions: from turn42 to turn50: 9 actions.\n\n        So H=9.\n\n        And we output:\n\n          Turn 42: U\n          Turn 43: U\n          Turn 44: U\n          Turn 45: U\n          Turn 46: U\n          Turn 47: U\n          Turn 48: U\n          Turn 49: U\n          Turn 50: U\n\n        But wait: is there any danger along the way?\n\n        We have to check at each state (t,y) for y in [1,8] whether (t,y) is dangerous.\n\n        We are at:\n          (43,1): freeway1 -> safe\n          (44,2): freeway2 -> safe (because dangerous only at 50,51)\n          (45,3): freeway3 -> safe\n          (46,4): freeway4 -> safe\n          (47,5): freeway5 -> safe\n          (48,6): freeway6 -> dangerous at 44, but 48 is not 44 -> safe\n          (49,7): freeway7 -> dangerous at 43, not 49 -> safe\n          (50,8): freeway8 -> dangerous at 43, not 50 -> safe\n\n        So all safe.\n\n        Therefore, we can reach in 9 turns.\n\n        But is there a faster way? 9 is the minimal without obstacles? So yes.\n\n        However, what if we start at 0 and we go up 9 times, but we have to avoid the dangerous events. The dangerous events at 43,44,50,51. But in this path we are not at any dangerous state.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have 9 actions.\n\n        And we are at (51,9) at the beginning of turn51, and we took 9 actions.\n\n        So we output the 9 actions.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 8 actions? Then we would be at turn42+8 = 50, and at the beginning of turn50 we are at 9? \n\nHow? We start at 0 at 42. Then after 8 actions, we are at turn50. We need to go from 0 to 9 in 8 moves? That requires moving up 9 times in 8 moves? Impossible. So minimal is 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n\nBut wait: the last action is at turn50, and then at turn51 we are at 9. But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn50, we are at 8 (not 9). Then we take U to get to 9 at turn51. But the problem requires that at the beginning of turn50 (which is the last action turn) we are at 9? \n\nNo: the last action turn is turn50. And we require that at the beginning of turn50, we are at 9? \n\nBut in our plan, at the beginning of turn50, we are at 8. Then we take U to get to 9 at the next state. So we are not at 9 at the beginning of turn50.\n\nSo we do not satisfy the requirement.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn50 (if we want H=9, then the last action is at turn50, so we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn50). \n\nBut we cannot be at 9 at the beginning of turn50 by taking only 9 actions? \n\nWe start at 42:0. After 8 actions, we are at turn50. The state at the beginning of turn50 is the state after 8 actions. We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn50. \n\nBut 8 moves: we can only go up 8 times? So we would be at 8 at the beginning of turn50. Then we take the 9th action (at turn50) and become 9 at turn51. \n\nBut then at the beginning of turn50, we are at 8, not 9. \n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn50, we must have been at 9 at the beginning of turn49, and then we take an action at turn49 to move away? but we want to be at 9 at turn50. \n\nAlternatively, we can be at 9 at turn50 by having been at 9 at the beginning of turn49 and then staying. \n\nBut then we would have reached 9 earlier.\n\nLet me compute: \n   To be at 9 at turn50: \n        We could have been at 9 at turn49 and then taken S or U (U is invalid) or D? \n        If we take S at turn49: then we stay at 9 at turn50.\n        Or D: then we become 8 at turn50.\n\n        Or we could have been at 8 at turn49 and then taken U at turn49 to get to 9 at turn50.\n\n        Or at 10? not allowed.\n\nSo two ways: \n  1. Be at 9 at turn49 and then S: then at turn50 we are at 9.\n  2. Be at 8 at turn49 and then U: then at turn50 we are at 9.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn50 (the beginning) and then we take the last action at turn50? \n\nBut the last action is at turn50, so we are at 9 at the beginning of turn50, and then we take an action. \n\nSo it's possible to be at 9 at the beginning of turn50.\n\nBut how many actions have we taken to get to (50,9)? \n\nWe start at (42,0). We take an action at turn42 to get to (43,y1), ... until we take an action at turn49 to get to (50,y50). \n\nThe actions: 42,43,...,49 -> 8 actions. Then at the beginning of turn50, we are at 9. \n\nThen we take the last action (the 9th action) at turn50. \n\nBut the requirement is that the sequence has H actions, and at the beginning of turn50 (which is the last action turn, since the last action is at turn50) we are at 9. \n\nBut we are at 9 at the beginning of turn50, then we take an action. \n\nSo we need to reach 9 by turn50.\n\nCan we reach 9 by turn50? That means in 8 actions (from turn42 to turn49) we go from 0 to 9. But 8 up moves would get us to 8. So we cannot get to 9 in 8 moves.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to be at 9 at the beginning of turn50.\n\nSimilarly, turn49: we would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn49. How many actions to get to turn49? 7 actions: then we can only get to 7.\n\nSo the minimal turn to be at 9 is turn51, as in the first plan, but then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn51, and then we take the action at turn51. \n\nBut the last action is at turn51, and the requirement is that at the beginning of turn51, we are at 9. \n\nThat is satisfied: at turn51, we are at 9 (at the beginning), and then we take the action at turn51.\n\nSo in the first plan, we have:\n\n   at turn42: 0 -> action U -> turn43:1\n   ...\n   at turn50:8 -> action U -> turn51:9\n\n   So at the beginning of turn51, we are at 9.\n\n   And the last action is at turn50 (which is the 9th action, and it is the last in the sequence) and then we are done.\n\n   But the problem requires that the sequence includes the action at turn50? and then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn51.\n\n   The beginning of turn51 is after the last action? \n\n   But the state at the beginning of turn51 is after the last action? \n\n   No: the action at turn50 causes the state at turn51. \n\n   So at the beginning of turn51, we are at 9. \n\n   Therefore, the requirement is satisfied.\n\n   And the number of actions is 9.\n\n   So the sequence is 9 actions: turn42 to turn50.\n\n   The actions: U repeated 9 times.\n\nBut we must check if there is a path that reaches 9 earlier? \n\n   For example, can we be at 9 at turn50? We just saw: no, because 8 actions only get to 8.\n\n   turn51 is the earliest.\n\n   So the minimal H is 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n\nBut let me verify with the dangerous events:\n\n   At turn43: we are at y=1 -> safe.\n   At turn44: we are at y=2 -> safe.\n   At turn45: y=3 -> safe.\n   At turn46: y=4 -> safe.\n   At turn47: y=5 -> safe.\n   At turn48: y=6 -> safe (because dangerous only at turn44 for freeway6).\n   At turn49: y=7 -> safe (freeway7 dangerous only at turn43).\n   At turn50: y=8 -> safe (freeway8 dangerous only at turn43, and freeways2-5 dangerous at 50 and 51, but we are at 8).\n\n   Then at turn51: we are at 9.\n\n   And we are not on any freeway at turn51.\n\n   So no collision.\n\n   And we took 9 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We only check when we are on a freeway. At turn51 we are at y=9, so not on freeway.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We have to go up 9 times, so minimal actions is 9. So this is minimal.\n\nBut what if we take a detour? For example, to avoid a dangerous event that isn't on our path? But in this path there is no danger. So detour would only take more actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have 9 turns: turns 42,43,...,50? \n\nThe actions are taken at turns 42,43,...,50 -> that's 9 turns.\n\nAnd we reach 9 at turn51.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence of 9 U's.\n\nBut let me write the answer in the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t1 + 1: ...\", so we start at 42 and go to 50.\n\nYes.\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn50, and then at turn51 we are at 9. And at the beginning of turn51, we are at 9, as required.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\", which is y_{42+9-1}=y_{50}=9? \n\nBut in our simulation, at turn50 (the beginning) we are at 8, not 9. \n\nThis is the confusion again.\n\nThe problem requires that at the beginning of turn50 (if H=9) we are at 9. But we are at 8.\n\nSo how do we reconcile?\n\nWe must have a path that is at 9 at the beginning of turn50.\n\nBut we can't with 9 moves.\n\nWhat if we use 10 moves? Then we would be at turn42+10-1 = turn51, and we require y_{51}=9.\n\nAnd with 10 moves, we can get to 9 at turn51? \n\nBut we can get to 9 in 9 moves (as above) at turn51. \n\nBut if we use 10 moves, then H=10, which is not minimal.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at 9 at turn50 by taking 9 moves? Impossible.\n\nOr am I miscounting the turns?\n\nLet me re-index:\n\n   Turn: 42 (start: y42=0)\n   Action a42: then at turn43: y43 = y42 + Δy42\n   ...\n   Action a_{42+8}: taken at turn50: then we become y51 = y50 + Δy50.\n\n   So after 9 actions, we are at turn51.\n\n   The state at turn51 is y51.\n\n   The problem says: we require y_{42+H-1}=9.\n\n   For H=9: we require y_{42+8}=y50=9.\n\n   But in our plan, y50=8.\n\n   So we do not satisfy.\n\n   Therefore, we must have y50=9.\n\n   How to achieve that?\n\n   We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn50. \n\n   How many actions to get to turn50? 8 actions (from turn42 to turn49) -> then we are at y50 at the beginning of turn50.\n\n   We need y50=9. But 8 up moves get us to 8. So we cannot be at 9.\n\n   Unless we move faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\n   Or if we are at 9 earlier and then we stay? \n\n   But to be at 9 at turn50, we could have been at 9 at turn49 and then stay (S) at turn49, then at turn50 we are still at 9.\n\n   But to be at 9 at turn49, we need 7 up moves? 7 up moves get us to 7. \n\n   Alternatively, to be at 9 at turn49, we need at least 9 actions? \n\n   Let's compute the minimal turn to be at 9.\n\n   The earliest turn to be at 9 is turn42+9=51, with 9 up moves.\n\n   But then we are at 9 at turn51.\n\n   To be at 9 at turn50, we would have to be at 9 at turn49 and then stay, or at 8 at turn49 and then move up. \n\n   To be at 9 at turn49: we need to take 9 actions by turn49? then we are at turn49 after 9 actions. But 9 actions can get us to 9 only at turn51 (because action at turn42->43:1, ... action at turn49->50: then at turn50 we are at 9? no: action at turn49 will update to turn50. \n\n   Specifically: \n        action0 (42) -> turn43:1\n        action1 (43) -> turn44:2\n        ...\n        action8 (49) -> turn50:9\n\n   So after 9 actions (at turns42..49), we are at turn50: and the state is y50=9.\n\n   Then the beginning of turn50? or at turn50 after the action? \n\n   In our state representation, the state (50,9) means at the beginning of turn50, we are at 9. \n\n   But how did we get there? \n\n        At the beginning of turn49, we were at 8. \n        Then we took U at turn49, and then at turn50 we became 9.\n\n   So the state at the beginning of turn50 is 9.\n\n   And the number of actions taken to get to (50,9) is 9 actions? \n\n   But note: we took 9 actions: at turns42,43,...,49. Then we are at (50,9) at the beginning of turn50. \n\n   Then, according to the problem, the sequence should be these 9 actions: a42 to a49. \n\n   But then the last action is at turn49, and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn50, and the next turn is turn50, but we don't take an action at turn50? \n\n   The problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Here H=9, so t=0..8, which is a42 to a49.\n\n   Then the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=y_{42+8}=y50=9. \n\n   So we are at 9 at turn50.\n\n   And we took actions only until turn49.\n\n   In this case, we don't take an action at turn50. \n\n   So the player is at 9 at turn50, and we stop.\n\n   This is valid.\n\n   How do we achieve this? \n\n        We start at (42,0).\n        a42: U -> (43,1)\n        a43: U -> (44,2)\n        a44: U -> (45,3)\n        a45: U -> (46,4)\n        a46: U -> (47,5)\n        a47: U -> (48,6)\n        a48: U -> (49,7)\n        a49: U -> (50,8) -> wait, this would give (50,8), not (50,9).\n\n   What's wrong? \n\n        We are at (49,7) at the beginning of turn49. \n        Then we take U at turn49: then we become y50 = 7+1 = 8.\n\n   To be at 9 at turn50, we need to be at 8 or 9 or 10 at turn49? \n        If we are at 9 at turn49 and take S, then we are at 9 at turn50.\n        If we are at 8 at turn49 and take U, then we are at 9 at turn50.\n\n   So we need to be at 8 or 9 at turn49.\n\n   To be at 8 at turn49: that would take 8 up moves in 7 actions? \n        actions: 7 up moves -> turn49: we would be at 7 at the beginning of turn49. Then we can take U to get to 8 at turn50, not 9.\n\n   To be at 9 at turn49: we would need 9 up moves in 7 actions? impossible.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot be at 9 at turn49.\n\n   So we cannot be at 9 at turn50 with only 9 actions taken at turns42..49.\n\n   Unless we move faster? But we can't.\n\n   So the only way to be at 9 at the beginning of a turn is at turn51 or later.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 9 actions, and we are at 9 at turn51. \n\n   But then the requirement is y_{42+9-1}=y_{50}=8, not 9.\n\n   This does not satisfy.\n\n   What if we do 10 actions? \n        Then we require y_{42+10-1}=y_{51}=9.\n        We can achieve that with 9 up moves and one stay: \n            8 up moves get us to 8 at turn50 (beginning).\n            then at turn50, we take U: then at turn51 we become 9.\n            then we are at (51,9) at the beginning of turn51.\n        Then the last action is at turn50, and the state at the beginning of turn51 is 9.\n\n        But the requirement for H=10 is that the state at the beginning of turn51 (which is the last action turn: because the last action is at turn50+10-1 = turn51? Let me compute: \n            actions: turn42,43,..., up to turn51: that's 10 actions.\n            then we require y_{42+10-1}=y_{51}=9.\n\n        So if we are at 9 at turn51, then it works.\n\n        But how do we get to 9 at turn51 with 10 actions? \n            We can do 9 up moves and one extra action that might be a stay or a down then up? \n\n        The fastest is: 9 up moves and then one stay at the end? \n            But then we would be at 9 at turn51 only if we were at 9 at turn50 and then we stay. \n\n        Alternatively, 9 up moves by turn50: \n            turn42: U ->43:1\n            ... \n            turn49: U ->50:8\n            turn50: U ->51:9\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn51, we are at 9.\n\n        And we took 9 up moves and the last action at turn50 is the 9th action? \n            actions: turn42 to turn50: 9 actions.\n\n        So to have 10 actions, we must take an extra action. \n\n        For example: \n            turn42: U ->43:1\n            turn43: U ->44:2\n            turn44: U ->45:3\n            turn45: U ->46:4\n            turn46: U ->47:5\n            turn47: U ->48:6\n            turn48: U ->49:7\n            turn49: U ->50:8\n            turn50: U ->51:9\n            turn51: S ->52:9   [but then we are at 9 at turn52, and we took 10 actions]\n\n        Then for H=10, we require y_{42+10-1}=y_{51}=9. -> satisfied.\n\n        But then the minimal H would be 10? but we can do it in 9 actions (yielding state (51,9)) but then the requirement for the state is not met because for H=9, we require y50=9, which is not met.\n\n        So if we do 9 actions, we are at (51,9) but the last state for the sequence is y50=8, not 9.\n\n        So we have to do 10 actions.\n\n        Then the sequence would be 10 actions: 9 U's and then one S or U (at turn51) but then at turn51 we are at 9, and we take an action at turn51: if we take S, then we stay at 9 at turn52.\n\n        But then for the sequence of 10 actions, we are at y_{51}=9 at the beginning of turn51, as required.\n\n        But is there a sequence of 10 actions that ends with the state at turn51 being 9, and we output the 10 actions.\n\n        The actions: \n            turn42: U\n            turn43: U\n            turn44: U\n            turn45: U\n            turn46: U\n            turn47: U\n            turn48: U\n            turn49: U\n            turn50: U  -> then at turn51 we are at 9.\n            turn51: S ( or U or D, but S is safe)\n\n        Then the state at the beginning of turn51 is 9, and we take action S at turn51, and then at turn52 we are at 9.\n\n        But the requirement for the sequence of 10 actions is that at the beginning of turn51 ( which is the last action turn for the sequence? for H=10, the actions are from turn42 to turn51, so the last action is at turn51. And we require y_{42+10-1}=y_{51}=9. -> yes.\n\n        So we output the 10 actions.\n\n        But is this minimal? H=10.\n\n        But earlier we thought H=9 is possible for reaching 9, but it doesn't satisfy the requirement on the state at the last action turn.\n\n        So we must have H>=10.\n\n        But wait, is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? for example, turn50. \n\n        To be at 9 at turn50, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn50. \n\n        How? \n          actions from turn42 to turn49: 8 actions. \n          with 8 actions, we can only get to 8 at turn50. \n          so impossible.\n\n        turn51 is the earliest turn to be at 9, and that requires at least 9 actions to be taken by turn50 (which gets us to 9 at turn51).\n\n        but then for the sequence of 9 actions, the last state is at turn50: which is 8, not 9.\n\n        so we must take one extra action.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\n        So we do 9 U's and then one S.\n\n        The sequence:\n\n          Turn42: U\n          Turn43: U\n          Turn44: U\n          Turn45: U\n          Turn46: U\n          Turn47: U\n          Turn48: U\n          Turn49: U\n          Turn50: U   // then at turn51, we are at 9 (at the beginning)\n          Turn51: S   // we are still at 9 at turn52, but we don't care.\n\n        Then the state at the beginning of turn51 ( which is the last action turn for the sequence? the last action is at turn51) is 9.\n\n        And we have taken 10 actions.\n\n        And the requirement is satisfied.\n\n        We must check that at turn51, when we are at 9, we are safe (which we are).\n\n        Also, along the way, the same as before, safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 10 actions.\n\n        But is there a path with 10 actions that reaches the state of 9 at an earlier turn? \n\n        For example, could we be at 9 at turn50 by taking a different path? \n\n        Suppose we try to move faster in the beginning? but we can only move one step per turn.\n\n        or use down moves to avoid danger and then move up, but that would not help to arrive earlier.\n\n        So turn51 is the earliest possible turn to be at 9.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n        So we output the 10 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns for the state (51,9) in the 10-action plan:\n\n   At turn42:0\n   a42:U -> turn43:1\n   a43:U -> turn44:2\n   a44:U -> turn45:3\n   a45:U -> turn46:4\n   a46:U -> turn47:5\n   a47:U -> turn48:6\n   a48:U -> turn49:7\n   a49:U -> turn50:8\n   a50:U -> turn51:9\n   a51:S -> turn52:9\n\n   The sequence of actions is from a42 to a51: 10 actions.\n\n   For the state at the last action turn (turn51), we are at the beginning of turn51: what is the state? \n        We became 9 at turn51 by the action at turn50. \n        So at the beginning of turn51, we are at 9.\n\n   Then we take action S at turn51.\n\n   The requirement is that at the beginning of turn51, we are at 9. -> yes.\n\n   So it satisfies.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n   So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: S\n}\n\n   But note: we could do Turn51: U? \n        But then we would go to 10, which is invalid.\n\n   Or Turn51: D? then to 8.\n\n   So S is the only safe choice.\n\n   But the problem doesn't require that we stay at 9, only that we are at 9 at the beginning of the last action turn.\n\n   So we can choose any action for the last one.\n\n   But to be safe, we choose S.\n\n   So this is valid.\n\n   Is there a way with H=10 but without the last S? \n\n   But we have to output 10 actions, so we must include an action at turn51.\n\n   And if we do U or D, we leave 9, but that's allowed.\n\n   But we are still safe.\n\n   However, S is simpler.\n\n   So we output 9 U's and then one S.\n\n   But note: could we do it in 10 actions without the last U-S, but with a different sequence? \n\n   For example, could we wait at some point to avoid a danger and still achieve 10 actions? \n\n   But in this case, we didn't encounter any danger, so this is optimal.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\nLet me double-check with the dangerous event at turn50: \n   At turn50: we are at y=8 (freeway8) at the beginning of turn50. Is that dangerous? \n        Freeway8: the car at turn50: \n            tail0 = -95, head0 = -48, s=48, dt=50-42=8.\n            tail = -95 + 48*8 = -95 + 384 = 289\n            head = -48 + 384 = 336\n        So the car is at [289,336], not covering 0. Also, freeway8 dangerous only at turn43. \n        So safe.\n\n   At turn51: we are at y=9, safe.\n\n   So the path is safe.\n\n   Therefore, we output the 10 actions.\n\nBut the minimal number of turns H is 10.\n\nSo the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) is 10, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 42. The player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) and must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) at specific turns. The dangerous turns for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 7 and 8 at turn 43\n- Freeway 6 at turn 44\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 at turns 50 and 51\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to move the player upward as quickly as possible while avoiding these dangerous states. The player moves up (U) for the first 9 actions, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 51. The 10th action is stay (S) to satisfy the requirement that the player is at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of the last action turn (turn 51).\n\nThe actions are:\n- Turns 42 to 50: Move up (U) to advance vertically without encountering any dangerous states.\n- Turn 51: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), ensuring the player is at the goal at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 43, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe).\n- At turn 44, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe as danger is at turns 50 and 51).\n- At turn 45, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe).\n- At turn 46, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe).\n- At turn 47, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe).\n- At turn 48, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe as danger is at turn 44).\n- At turn 49, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe as danger is at turn 43).\n- At turn 50, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe as danger is at turn 43).\n- At turn 51, \\(y = 9\\) (goal, safe).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ } S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 48. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn T. Importantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: head h=48, tail τ=37, direction right, speed s=12\n\n- Freeway 2: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=6\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=6\n\n- Freeway 4: same: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=6\n\n- Freeway 5: same: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=6\n\n- Freeway 6: head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed s=36\n\n- Freeway 7: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed s=48\n\n- Freeway 8: same as 7: h=-48, τ=-95, right, s=48\n\nAll cars are moving right, meaning their positions increase over time since direction is right.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would decrease, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the update: right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince head and tail, for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head increases.\n\nIn the given, for freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, right, so at t_1, span is [37,48] since head=48 > tail=37, so it's from left to right, tail to head.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for direction, right or left.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end. So at time t, position x from tail to head.\n\nAt turn T, for right-moving car: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in this interval for the freeway the player is on at turn T.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and y=0 is start, both no cars.\n\nTo reach (0,9), player needs to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H: since y from 0 to 9, at least 9 moves up, but player can move down or stay, but to minimize turns, probably want to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions on rows 1-8.\n\nAlso, since moving up takes one turn per row, minimal H is at least 9, if no delays.\n\nBut with cars, might need to wait or something.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to see when the car span includes 0, because that's when collision would happen if player is on that row.\n\nCollision only if player is on that row and 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nFor each row k, we need the times T when 0 is in the car's span for that row.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span changes with time.\n\nLet t_1 = 48.\n\nFor each freeway, let's compute the span as a function of time T.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t_1 = T - 48.\n\nThen for each car, Span(T) = [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt] for right-moving.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, and s > 0, the span moves to the right over time.\n\nFor a given row, we need for which Δt, 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nWhich means:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSo:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nAnd 0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nAlso, since it's a closed interval, equality is included.\n\nSo 0 is in span when max( ceil(-h/s), something) but since Δt integer, we need to find integer Δt where the inequalities hold.\n\nΔt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nT and t_1 are integers, I assume.\n\nSo for each car, the times when 0 is covered:\n\nΔt_min = ceil( -h / s ) ? Let's see.\n\nFrom above:\n\nΔt ≥ ceil( -h / s ) ? h and s are integers, I think.\n\nLook at the values.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: h=48, τ=37, s=12, right\n\nSo Δt ≥ -h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -37/12 = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nNow, Δt ≥ -4 and Δt ≤ -3.083\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt ≥ -4 and Δt ≤ -3? -3.083, so Δt ≤ -4? No.\n\nΔt ≥ ceil( -h/s ) and Δt ≤ floor( -τ/s )? Let's think carefully.\n\nFrom:\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s and Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince s>0.\n\nSo -h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\n-τ/s = -37/12 = -3.0833...\n\nSo Δt ≥ -4 and Δt ≤ -3.0833\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt ≥ -4 and Δt ≤ -4? No, -3.0833, so Δt must be <= -4? No.\n\nFor example, Δt = -4: -4 <= -3.0833? -4 < -3.0833, so Δt <= -3.0833 means Δt <= -4 since integer? No.\n\n-3.0833, integers less than or equal to -3.0833 are -4, -5, -6, etc. Because -4 = -4.0 < -3.0833, -3 = -3.0 > -3.0833? -3.0 > -3.0833, so -3 is greater than -3.0833.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\n-τ/s = -37/12 = -3.0833\n\nΔt ≤ -3.0833\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt <= -4 because -4 = -4.0 < -3.0833, and -3 = -3.0 > -3.0833, so Δt <= -4.\n\nSimilarly, Δt >= -4 from the other inequality.\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.0833, so Δt <= -4 since -4 <= -4.0 <= -3.0833? -4.0 < -3.0833, and -4.0 <= -3.0833 is true? -4.0 is less than -3.0833, so -4.0 <= -3.0833 is true because -4.0 < -3.0833.\n\nIn terms of inequality:\n\n-4.0 <= -3.0833 is true because -4.0 is smaller.\n\nNumerically: -4.0 < -3.0833 < 0, so -4.0 <= -3.0833 is true.\n\nBut Δt <= -3.0833 means values that are less than or equal to -3.0833, so for integers, Δt = -4, -5, -6, ... because -4 = -4.0 <= -3.0833, -5 <=, etc. But -3 = -3.0 > -3.0833, so not <=.\n\nSimilarly, Δt >= -4.0, so Δt >= -4.\n\nThus for Δt, it must satisfy Δt >= -4 and Δt <= -4? Δt <= -4 and Δt >= -4, so only Δt = -4.\n\nΔt >= -4 and Δt <= -4.0833? -3.0833.\n\nΔt >= -4.0 and Δt <= -3.0833\n\nSince Δt integer, possible values: Δt >= -4 and Δt <= -4? No, -3.0833 is greater than -4.\n\nFor example, Δt = -4: -4.0 >= -4.0 true, -4.0 <= -3.0833 true because -4.0 < -3.0833\n\nΔt = -3: -3.0 >= -4.0 true, but -3.0 <= -3.0833? -3.0 > -3.0833, so false.\n\nΔt = -5: -5 <= -4 false? -5 < -4, so -5 >= -4 false.\n\nΔt >= -4 means Δt = -4, -3, -2, ... but Δt <= -3.0833 only for Δt <= -4, since -4 <= -3.0833, -5 <=, but -4 >= -4, -5 < -4 not >=.\n\nSo only Δt = -4.\n\nLet's compute numerically.\n\n- h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\n- τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.0833\n\nΔt must be >= -4 and <= -3.0833\n\n-4 <= -3.0833 is true, but for integer Δt, Δt must be at least -4 and at most the floor of -3.0833, but -3.0833, floor is -4? Floor of -3.0833 is -4? No, floor is towards minus infinity.\n\nFloor of -3.0833 is -4, because -4 < -3.0833 < -3, so floor is -4.\n\nCeil of -3.0833 is -3.\n\nBut for inequality:\n\nΔt >= ceil(-h/s) ? -h/s = -4, ceil(-4) = -4\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) ? -τ/s ≈ -3.0833, floor is -4\n\nSo Δt >= -4 and Δt <= -4, so only Δt = -4.\n\nYes.\n\nFor freeway 1, 0 is in span only at Δt = -4.\n\nBut Δt = T - t_1, so T = t_1 + Δt = 48 - 4 = 44.\n\nAt turn T=44, for freeway 1, 0 is covered.\n\nBut we are at turn t_1=48, which is later, so for future turns, Δt >=0, and for Δt=0, let's check.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=t_1=48, span is [τ +0, h+0] = [37,48], 0 not in [37,48], since 0<37, so no.\n\nFor Δt>0, span moves right, so left end τ + s Δt > τ >0, so 0 not covered for Δt >=0.\n\nSimilarly for past, but we care about future turns from t_1 onwards, so for freeway 1, no collision at any T >= t_1, since 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow freeway 2: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6, right\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/6 = 48/6 = 8\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/6 = 59/6 ≈ 9.8333\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-48)/6 = 48/6 = 8\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-59)/6 = 59/6 ≈9.8333\n\nSo Δt >=8 and Δt <=9.8333\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt=8 or 9 or 10? Δt<=9.8333, so Δt=8,9\n\nΔt=8: 8>=8 true, 8<=9.8333 true\n\nΔt=9: 9>=8 true, 9<=9.8333 true\n\nΔt=10: 10>=8 true, 10<=9.8333 false\n\nSo for freeway 2, 0 covered at Δt=8 and 9, i.e., T= t_1 +8 =48+8=56, and T=48+9=57.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, since same values, so also at T=56 and 57.\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=56,57\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=56,57\n\nNow freeway 6: h=-48, τ=-83, s=36, right\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\n- τ/s = -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈2.3056\n\nΔt >= -h/s = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = 83/36 ≈2.3056\n\nSo Δt >= 1.333 and Δt <= 2.3056\n\nInteger Δt: since Δt >= ceil(1.333)=2? ceil(1.333)=2\n\nΔt <= floor(2.3056)=2\n\nSo Δt=2\n\nΔt >= 1.333, so Δt=2,3,... but Δt<=2.3056, so Δt=2\n\nΔt=1: 1>=1.333? 1<1.333, false\n\nΔt=2: 2>=1.333 true, 2<=2.3056 true\n\nΔt=3: 3>=1.333 true, 3<=2.3056 false\n\nSo only Δt=2, T=48+2=50\n\nFreeway 7: h=-48, τ=-95, s=48, right\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/48 = 48/48 =1\n\n- τ/s = -(-95)/48 = 95/48 ≈1.979\n\nΔt >= -h/s =1\n\nΔt <= -τ/s =95/48≈1.979\n\nSo Δt >=1 and Δt <=1.979\n\nInteger Δt: Δt=1 or 2? Δt>=1, Δt<=1.979, so Δt=1\n\nΔt=1: 1>=1 true, 1<=1.979 true\n\nΔt=2: 2<=1.979 false\n\nSo only Δt=1, T=48+1=49\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, so also at T=49\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the times when car covers 0:\n\n- Row 1: no coverage for T>=48\n\n- Row 2: covered at T=56,57\n\n- Row 3: covered at T=56,57\n\n- Row 4: covered at T=56,57\n\n- Row 5: covered at T=56,57\n\n- Row 6: covered at T=50\n\n- Row 7: covered at T=49\n\n- Row 8: covered at T=49\n\nT=49 and T=50 are soon, while T=56,57 are later.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=48.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 at t=48.\n\nAt each turn, player chooses action to change y.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is covered.\n\nCovered means if player is on that row at that turn, collision.\n\nFor example, row 7 and 8 are covered at T=49.\n\nRow 6 at T=50.\n\nRows 2-5 covered at T=56,57, which are later, so if we can reach y=9 before T=56, we might avoid them, but row 6 and 7,8 have earlier issues.\n\nNow, player at t=48, y=0.\n\nIf we go up immediately, at t=48, action U, then at t=49, y=1.\n\nBut at t=49, row 7 and 8 are covered, but player is on y=1, not 7 or 8, so no collision.\n\nAt t=49, if player on y=1, and row 1 has no car issue at t=49, as we saw.\n\nThen, if at t=49, action U, to y=2 at t=50.\n\nAt t=50, player on y=2.\n\nNow, at t=50, row 6 is covered, but player on y=2, not 6, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 and 8 covered at t=49, but t=50 not covered? For row 7, covered only at t=49, not before or after? Earlier we have only at t=49 for row 7 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 only at t=50.\n\nSo at t=50, if player on y=2, row 2 not covered yet, covered only at t=56,57.\n\nBut row 6 covered at t=50, but player not on row 6.\n\nSo seems we can keep going up.\n\nBut let's see row 1: at t=48, player on y=0, not freeway.\n\nt=48: y=0\n\nAction U: y_{49} =1\n\nAt t=49: player on y=1. Row 1: no coverage, row 7 and 8 covered, but not relevant.\n\nThen action U: y_{50} =2\n\nAt t=50: player on y=2. Row 2 not covered (covered at 56,57), row 6 covered, but not on row 6.\n\nAction U: y_{51}=3\n\nt=51: on y=3, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, U: y_{52}=4\n\nU: y_{53}=5\n\nU: y_{54}=6\n\nNow at t=54, player on y=6.\n\nBut row 6 is covered at t=50, which is past, so at t=54, row 6: what is coverage?\n\nFor row 6, we have coverage only at t=50, as per earlier calculation.\n\nAt t=54, Δt = T -48 =6, for row 6: s=36, τ=-83, h=-48\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-83 + 36*6, -48 + 36*6] = [-83 + 216, -48 + 216] = [133, 168], which does not include 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times not covered.\n\nSo at t=54, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen U: y_{55}=7\n\nt=55: on y=7\n\nRow 7: covered only at t=49, so at t=55, Δt=7, span: τ=-95, s=48, h=-48\n\n[ -95 + 48*7, -48 + 48*7] = [-95 + 336, -48 + 336] = [241, 288], not include 0, safe.\n\nU: y_{56}=8\n\nt=56: on y=8\n\nNow, row 8: covered at t=49? At t=56, Δt=8, span: [-95 + 48*8, -48 + 48*8] = [-95 + 384, -48 + 384] = [289, 336], not 0.\n\nBut row 8 is covered only at t=49, as per earlier.\n\nBut at t=56, what about row 2-5? They are covered at t=56 and 57.\n\nPlayer is on y=8 at t=56.\n\nRow 8 is not covered at t=56, only row 2-5 covered.\n\nBut player on y=8, so no collision.\n\nThen U: y_{57}=9\n\nt=57: on y=9, which is goal, and no cars, so reached.\n\nBut at t=57, player on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about row 8 at t=57? But player not on it.\n\nIn this sequence, we reached at t=57 with y=9.\n\nt=48: y=0\n\nt=49: y=1 (after U)\n\nt=50: y=2 (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to t=57: y=9\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, 9 moves, so at t=48 + 9 = t=57, y=9.\n\nt=48: start, position at turn t, y_t.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t=48, position (0, y_{48}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{48}, y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t=49, position (0, y_{49})\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo have y_{t} =9 at some t.\n\nIn minimal turns, we want to increase y as fast as possible.\n\nIn the above, from t=48 to t=57, we used 9 actions: U at t=48 to t=56, and at t=57 y=9.\n\nt=48: action, then y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy\n\nSet t_index.\n\nStart: turn 48, y=0\n\nAction a_{48}: if U, then y_{49} = 0 +1 =1\n\nThen at turn 49, position y=1\n\nAction a_{49}: U, y_{50}=2\n\n...\n\nAction a_{56}: U, y_{57} = y_{56} +1, and if y_{56}=8, then y_{57}=9.\n\nAt turn 57, position y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=48 to t=57, that is 10 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=48, before action.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 =48.\n\nAfter action at t_1, y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter action at t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +2}, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, starting from y=0, we need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 up moves.\n\nAfter k up moves, y increases by k.\n\nAfter first U, y=1, after second U, y=2, ..., after ninth U, y=9.\n\nThe turn when y=9: after the ninth action.\n\nActions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince start y_{t_1} =0, we need exactly 9 up moves, and no down or stay, to minimize time.\n\nWith down or stay, it takes more turns, so minimal H should be 9 with all U.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U, we have:\n\nt=48: action U, y_{49}=1\n\nt=49: action U, y_{50}=2\n\nt=50: action U, y_{51}=3\n\nt=51: action U, y_{52}=4\n\nt=52: action U, y_{53}=5\n\nt=53: action U, y_{54}=6\n\nt=54: action U, y_{55}=7\n\nt=55: action U, y_{56}=8\n\nt=56: action U, y_{57}=9\n\nNow, at which turns is player on which row:\n\nAt turn t=48: y=0, not freeway\n\nt=49: y=1, row 1\n\nt=50: y=2, row 2\n\nt=51: y=3, row 3\n\nt=52: y=4, row 4\n\nt=53: y=5, row 5\n\nt=54: y=6, row 6\n\nt=55: y=7, row 7\n\nt=56: y=8, row 8\n\nt=57: y=9, not freeway\n\nNow, check for collision:\n\nRow 1: at t=49, no coverage, as earlier\n\nRow 2: at t=50, coverage at t=56,57, not t=50, so safe\n\nSimilarly, row 3 at t=51, no coverage (coverage at 56,57)\n\nRow 4 at t=52, no\n\nRow 5 at t=53, no\n\nRow 6 at t=54: coverage only at t=50, not t=54, safe\n\nRow 7 at t=55: coverage only at t=49, not t=55, safe\n\nRow 8 at t=56: coverage only at t=49, not t=56, safe\n\nAnd t=57, y=9, safe.\n\nBut row 2-5 are covered at t=56 and 57, but at t=56, player is on row 8, not row 2-5.\n\nAt t=57, player on row 9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collision at all.\n\nThus, with all U actions, we reach at t=57, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions: from t=48 to t=56 inclusive? Actions at t=48 to t=56, that's 9 actions (48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56), and at t=57, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =56, so H=9, since t_1 + H -1 =48 + H -1, set to 56, so 48 + H -1 =56, thus H-1=8, H=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut earlier I thought row 6 and 7 have coverage at t=50 and t=49, but in the sequence, at those times, player was on lower rows.\n\nSpecifically, at t=49, coverage on row 7 and 8, but player on row 1.\n\nAt t=50, coverage on row 6, player on row 2.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with all U.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? That would require decreasing y or something, but from 0 to 9, must have at least 9 up moves, so H cannot be less than 9.\n\nWith down or stay, it would take more than 9 actions to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we stay or go down, y increases slower, so more turns needed.\n\nThus minimal H is 9.\n\nAnd with all U, it works as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the coverage times again.\n\nFor row 7: covered at T=49 only.\n\nAt T=49, Δt=1, span: τ + s Δt = -95 + 48*1 = -95+48= -47? h + s Δt = -48 +48=0? Let's compute.\n\nFor row 7: at T, span [τ + s (T-48), h + s (T-48)] = [-95 + 48*(T-48), -48 + 48*(T-48)]\n\nAt T=49, Δt=1, span: [-95 + 48*1, -48 + 48*1] = [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0]\n\nNow, 0 is included, since tail -47, head 0, so [ -47, 0 ], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=50, Δt=2, [-95 + 96, -48 + 96] = [1,48], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 same.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=49, player on row 1, not row 7 or 8, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at T=50: Δt=2, span: τ=-83, s=36, h=-48\n\n[-83 + 36*2, -48 + 36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24], includes 0.\n\nBut at T=50, in sequence, player on row 2, not row 6.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, rows 2-5 covered at T=56 and 57.\n\nFor example, row 2: at T=56, Δt=8, τ=-59, s=6, h=-48\n\nSpan: [-59 + 6*8, -48 + 6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], includes 0.\n\nAt T=57, Δt=9, [-59 + 54, -48 + 54] = [-5, 6], includes 0.\n\nBut at T=56, player on row 8, not row 2.\n\nAt T=57, player on row 9, not freeway.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=9, actions at t=48 to t=56.\n\nEach action U.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 56: U\n\nThen at turn 57, position is (0,9)\n\nNow, in the car state, freeway 1 has a car, but we didn't have issue.\n\nFreeway 1: head 48, tail 37, s=12, at t=48, span [37,48], not 0.\n\nIn future, moves right, so no 0.\n\nBut in the sequence, we were on row 1 at t=49, which was fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut I think I missed something: the car on row 1, is it problematic? No, because at t=49, when on row 1, the car on row 1: span at t=49, Δt=1, τ=37, s=12, h=48\n\n[37 +12*1, 48+12*1] = [49,60], not 0, so no coverage at t=49.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with actions all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in this case, H=9, sequence all U.\n\nBut perhaps we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo for t_1=48,\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nThen done.\n\nBut H=9, from t=48 to t=56 actions.\n\nNow, but let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy from action.\n\nAnd y must be in [0,9], which it is.\n\nCollision only if on freeway and 0 in span at that turn.\n\nIn this case, no collision.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but cannot, since 9 steps needed.\n\nUnless we start from y=0, and go up, min 9 moves.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 3,4,5 all same as 2, but we didn't go to them at critical times.\n\nIn this path, we are on each row only once, at times not covered.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nRow 1 at t=49: not covered\n\nRow 2 at t=50: row 2 covered only at 56,57, so t=50 not covered\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps for row 6, covered at t=50, but we are on it at t=54, not 50.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and we did.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be boxed.\n\nSo for turn t_1=48:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nSince all same, but we need to write each turn.\n\nIn the format.\n\nPerhaps we can write it clearly.\n\nBut I think that's it.\n\nBut let me confirm if at some point, when moving, but the note says when moving to new row, at turn T, you are still on old row, so for example, when moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are on y, and action changes to y+1 for next turn.\n\nIn collision, it's based on position at turn T, which is before the action? No.\n\nAt turn T, the position is y_T, and then action is taken, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked based on y_T at turn T.\n\nIn the dynamics, it says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen you take action at turn T, it sets y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are at y_T.\n\nSo for example, at turn T, if y_T = k, and on freeway k, and 0 in span for that car, collision.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nAt each turn T from 48 to 56, y_T:\n\nT=48: y=0, not freeway\n\nT=49: y=1, freeway 1, but car not covering 0\n\nT=50: y=2, freeway 2, not covering 0 (covers at 56,57)\n\nT=51: y=3, freeway 3, not covering\n\nT=52: y=4, freeway 4, not\n\nT=53: y=5, freeway 5, not\n\nT=54: y=6, freeway 6, at T=54, not covering (covers at T=50)\n\nT=55: y=7, freeway 7, not covering (covers at T=49)\n\nT=56: y=8, freeway 8, not covering (covers at T=49)\n\nT=57: y=9, not freeway, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for turns 48 to 56.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) is 9, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\nThe car positions are evaluated for each freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) to determine when the position \\(x = 0\\) is covered by a car span at any turn \\(T \\geq t_1 = 48\\). The span for a right-moving car at turn \\(T\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Span}(T) = [\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) is the tail, \\(h\\) is the head, and \\(s\\) is the speed.

Moving up (U) at every turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 9 turns (actions at turns \\(48\\) to \\(56\\), position \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(57\\)).\n\n- At turn \\(48\\), \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway, no collision possible).\n- At turn \\(49\\), \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, no collision as \\(0 \\notin \\text{Span}(49)\\)).\n- At turn \\(50\\), \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, no collision as coverage at \\(T = 56, 57\\) only).\n- At turn \\(51\\), \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, no collision as coverage at \\(T = 56, 57\\) only).\n- At turn \\(52\\), \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, no collision as coverage at \\(T = 56, 57\\) only).\n- At turn \\(53\\), \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, no collision as coverage at \\(T = 56, 57\\) only).\n- At turn \\(54\\), \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, no collision as coverage only at \\(T = 50\\)).\n- At turn \\(55\\), \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, no collision as coverage only at \\(T = 49\\)).\n- At turn \\(56\\), \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, no collision as coverage only at \\(T = 49\\)).\n- At turn \\(57\\), \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, goal reached).\n\nThis path avoids all collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal \\(H = 9\\) turns, as fewer turns are impossible (9 up moves required to increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9).\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 48\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 56\\) is all U (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: & U \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeway we are on at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at turn T) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, the player moves to y+1 (so then we check the car on freeway y+1 at turn T+1).\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to 8) and we start at y=3. We need to go to y=9 (which is above freeway 8). So we must pass through freeways 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThe car on each freeway is given at turn t1=51. We need to compute the car's span at any future turn T (with T>=51). The car moves at constant speed.\n\nFor a car at t1=51 with (h, tau, d, s):\n- If d is right: then at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-51), h + s*(T-51)]\n- If d is left: then at turn T, the span is [h - s*(T-51), tau - s*(T-51)]\n\nBut note: the given cars for freeways 1 to 8 are:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> right: so at T: [ -47 + 12*(T-51), -36 + 12*(T-51) ]\nFreeway 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> [ -41 + 6*(T-51), -30 + 6*(T-51) ]\nFreeway 3: same as 2? Actually the table says:\n  1: (-36,-47,right,12)\n  2: (-30,-41,right,6)\n  3: (-30,-41,right,6)\n  4: (-30,-41,right,6)\n  5: (-30,-41,right,6)\n  6: (60,25,right,36) -> note: here head=60, tail=25? But in the update for right: they say [tau + s*(T-51), h + s*(T-51)] so [25+36*(T-51), 60+36*(T-51)]\n  7: (96,49,right,48) -> [49+48*(T-51), 96+48*(T-51)]\n  8: same as 7: (96,49,right,48) -> same as freeway 7.\n\nBut wait: the table says for freeway 6: (60,25,right,36). However, note that in the car update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially at t1: the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (so the rightmost point) and the tail is the leftmost? But the update rule says: \n      \"Right-moving: [Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo in the table, for freeway 6: head=60, tail=25? But in the update rule, they write [tau, h] for the initial span? So that would be [25,60] at t1=51. Then at T, it becomes [25+36*(T-51), 60+36*(T-51)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7 and 8: [49,96] at t1=51, then [49+48*(T-51), 96+48*(T-51)].\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn 51. We need to go to y=9. We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). But we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T when the car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at some future turns. We are particularly interested in the times when we are on a freeway. Since we start at y=3 and want to go to y=9, we must pass through y=4,5,6,7,8. We start at y=3 at turn 51.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn 51. So we are on freeway 3 at turn 51. We must check: is 0 in the car span of freeway 3 at turn 51?\n\nFreeway 3: at T=51: [ -41 + 6*(51-51), -30 + 6*(0) ] = [-41, -30]. 0 is not in [-41,-30]. So safe.\n\nNow, we can plan a sequence of moves. We want minimal H. The minimal vertical distance is 6 (from 3 to 9). So at least 6 moves of 'U'. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we will step on, at the exact turn we are on that freeway, that 0 is not in the car's span at that turn.\n\nWe can move only one step per turn. So if we go up every turn, we would be:\n\nTurn 51: y=3 -> then we choose an action for turn51 that will determine y52.\n\nBut note: at turn51 we are at y=3. Then we choose a51 (which is the action at turn51) and then y52 = y51 + delta.\n\nWe are to output actions from turn51 to the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- On freeway 4: when we are at y=4 at some turn T, we must avoid the car on freeway4 at turn T.\nSimilarly for 5,6,7,8.\n\nWe are already at y=3 at turn51 and safe.\n\nLet me compute the car positions for freeways 4,5,6,7,8 at future turns.\n\nNote: freeways 1,2,3 are below us, so we won't go back? We are going up. But note: we can also move down? But that would increase H. Since we are going to 9, and we are at 3, going down is counterproductive. So we assume we only move up or stay.\n\nSo actions: U or S (D is not useful).\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of U and S to go from y=3 to y=9, avoiding the cars on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 at the turns we are on those freeways.\n\nWe will step on freeway4 when we are at y=4. That will happen at some turn T>=51. Similarly for the others.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn51.\n\nIf we do U at turn51: then at turn52 we are at y=4.\nThen if we do U at turn52: turn53 at y=5, and so on until turn56 at y=8, then turn57 at y=9.\n\nSo that would be 6 consecutive U: \n  turn51: U -> y52=4\n  turn52: U -> y53=5\n  turn53: U -> y54=6\n  turn54: U -> y55=7\n  turn55: U -> y56=8\n  turn56: U -> y57=9 -> then we stop at H=6 (since we started at t1=51, and we have t51 to t56: 6 actions, and at t57 we are at 9? Actually the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions? \n\nBut note: we start at turn51 (t=0 in the sequence index? but the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at y=9? Actually, the player update: after H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions, and after H actions we are at (0,9). So we start at t1, and we take action at t1, then t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at (0,9).\n\nSo if we take 6 U actions, then at turn57 (which is t1+6) we are at y=9. So H=6.\n\nBut we must check that at each step we are safe.\n\nSo the path:\n\nTurn51: at y=3 -> safe (as computed above).\n\nTurn51: action U -> then at turn52 we are at y=4. So at turn52, we are on freeway4. We must check freeway4 at turn52.\n\nFreeway4: car is (-30,-41,right,6). At turn T=52: \n  [ -41 + 6*(52-51), -30 + 6*(1) ] = [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35, -24]. 0 is not in [-35,-24]. Safe.\n\nTurn52: action U -> turn53 at y=5. Check freeway5 at turn53.\n\nFreeway5: same as 4? The car is the same: (-30,-41,right,6). At T=53: [ -41+6*(53-51) = -41+12 = -29, -30+12 = -18]. Span [-29,-18]. 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn53: action U -> turn54 at y=6. Check freeway6 at turn54.\n\nFreeway6: (60,25,right,36). At T=54: \n  [25 + 36*(54-51) = 25 + 36*3 = 25+108=133, 60+108=168]. So [133,168]. 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn54: action U -> turn55 at y=7. Check freeway7 at turn55.\n\nFreeway7: (96,49,right,48). At T=55: \n  [49 + 48*(55-51) = 49 + 48*4 = 49+192=241, 96+192=288]. [241,288]. 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn55: action U -> turn56 at y=8. Check freeway8 at turn56.\n\nFreeway8: same as 7: (96,49,right,48). At T=56: \n  [49 + 48*(56-51) = 49 + 48*5 = 49+240=289, 96+240=336]. [289,336]. Safe.\n\nThen turn56: action U -> turn57 at y=9. We are done.\n\nSo we can do 6 consecutive U moves and avoid all cars? \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So when we are at turn52 and we are at y=4, we are only on freeway4 at turn52. Similarly, at turn53 at y=5, we are only on freeway5 at turn53, etc.\n\nAnd at each of these turns, the car on that freeway does not cover 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n\nBut note: at turn56 we are at y=8, and we do U to get to y=9 at turn57. The last action is at turn56, and then at turn57 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we output 6 actions: from turn51 to turn56.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so H=6, then t from 0 to 5: \n  t=0: turn51\n  t=1: turn52\n  ...\n  t=5: turn56\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n\nBut wait: is there any car that might hit us if we wait? We didn't have to wait. So this is the minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway6 at turn54: we are at y=6 at turn54. The car is at [25+36*(54-51)=25+108=133, 60+108=168]. So the car is from 133 to 168? Then 0 is not in there. But note: the car is moving to the right. At turn51, the car was at [25,60]? So at turn51, the car is at [25,60]? Then at turn52: [25+36=61, 60+36=96] -> [61,96]\nturn53: [25+72=97, 60+72=132]\nturn54: [133,168] as above.\n\nBut what about turn51? The car at freeway6 at turn51: [25,60]. 0 is not in [25,60]. But we are not on freeway6 at turn51 (we are at y=3 then). Similarly, at turn52 we are at y=4, so we don't care about freeway6 at turn52.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn55: [49+48*4=49+192=241, 96+192=288] -> no 0.\n\nBut wait: what if we go slower? For example, if we stay at a freeway for an extra turn? Then the car moves and might cover 0? But in this case, we are going through quickly and the cars are far to the right (positive) and moving right, so they are moving away from 0. So they will never cover 0 in the future? \n\nActually, for freeways 4 and 5: the cars are at negative positions and moving right. So they will eventually pass 0? \n\nLet me check for freeway4: \n  The car: [ -41 + 6*(T-51), -30 + 6*(T-51) ]\n\nWe are at freeway4 at turn52: T=52 -> [-35,-24] (as above). When does it cover 0?\n  We need: -41 + 6*(T-51) <= 0 <= -30 + 6*(T-51)\n\nBut note: the span is [A, B] = [ -41+6*(T-51), -30+6*(T-51) ]\n\nSet A <= 0 <= B.\n\nFirst, 0 <= B: 0 <= -30 + 6*(T-51) -> 6*(T-51) >= 30 -> T-51>=5 -> T>=56.\n\nThen, A <= 0: -41 + 6*(T-51) <=0 -> 6*(T-51) <=41 -> T-51<=41/6≈6.83 -> T<=57.83 -> T<=57.\n\nSo at T=56: A = -41+6*5 = -41+30 = -11, B=-30+30=0 -> so [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included? \n\nAt T=56: \n  A = -41 + 6*(56-51) = -41+30 = -11\n  B = -30 + 30 = 0\n\nSo the span is [-11,0]. This includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=57: \n  A = -41 + 6*6 = -41+36 = -5\n  B = -30+36=6\n  Then [ -5,6] -> includes 0.\n\nAt T=58: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo for freeway4, 0 is in the car at T=56 and T=57.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: same car? so same times: T=56 and 57.\n\nBut we are at freeway4 at turn52 (if we go up immediately) and that was T=52 which is safe. We are not at freeway4 at T=56.\n\nSimilarly, we are at freeway5 at turn53, which is safe.\n\nBut what if we had waited? Then we might be at freeway4 at a later turn? But we don't need to. We went through at T=52 and T=53 for freeway4 and 5 respectively, and that was safe.\n\nNow, what about freeway6? The car is moving right and is already at positive and getting more positive. So 0 is never covered? \n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: same.\n\nSo the direct path is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we consider freeway3 again? We are leaving freeway3 at turn51 (by moving up at turn51). But at turn51 we are at freeway3 and safe. We don't come back.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=6.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n\nBut note: at turn56 we are at y=8, and we do U to go to y=9 at turn57. And we are done.\n\nHowever, let me check if we can do it in less? The minimal number of moves is 6 because we have to go up 6 steps. So no, 6 is minimal.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is (0,3). We need to get to (0,9). So we need 6 moves up. So H=6 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=6, so t from 0 to 5: which corresponds to turns 51 to 56.\n\nSo that's the answer.\n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway3 at turn51? We already checked: at turn51, the car on freeway3 (which is y=3) is [-41, -30] at turn51? But wait, the update rule for right-moving: \n  Initial span at t1: [tau, h] = [-41, -30]? \nBut the problem says: for freeway3: (-30,-41,right,6). So head=-30, tail=-41? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-41, -30]? Yes.\n\nSo 0 is not in [-41,-30]. Safe.\n\nAnd we are moving up immediately.\n\nBut note: if we had to stay at freeway3 for an extra turn, then at turn52 the car on freeway3 would be: \n  [ -41 + 6*(52-51) = -35, -30+6 = -24] -> [-35,-24] -> still safe? \nBut we don't need to.\n\nSo the above sequence is safe and minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what about freeway8 at turn56? We are at y=8 at turn56. The car on freeway8 at turn56: \n  [49 + 48*(56-51) = 49+240=289, 96+240=336] -> [289,336]. 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from (0, 3) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). The player starts at turn \\(t_1 = 51\\) at \\(y = 3\\). The minimal vertical distance to cover is 6 units (from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\)), requiring at least 6 upward moves (actions \"U\").\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- Collision occurs if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on freeway \\(k\\) (i.e., \\(y_T = k\\)) and the car on freeway \\(k\\) at turn \\(T\\) has a span that includes the x-coordinate 0.\n- The cars on freeways 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (which the player must cross) are analyzed for the turns when the player would be on each freeway if moving upward consecutively.\n\n#### Car Positions at Relevant Turns:\n- **Freeway 4 (car: head = -30, tail = -41, direction = right, speed = 6)**:\n  - At \\(T = 52\\): span = \\([-41 + 6 \\times (52 - 51), -30 + 6 \\times (52 - 51)] = [-35, -24]\\). 0 \\(\\notin\\) \\([-35, -24]\\) (safe).\n- **Freeway 5 (car: head = -30, tail = -41, direction = right, speed = 6)**:\n  - At \\(T = 53\\): span = \\([-41 + 6 \\times (53 - 51), -30 + 6 \\times (53 - 51)] = [-29, -18]\\). 0 \\(\\notin\\) \\([-29, -18]\\) (safe).\n- **Freeway 6 (car: head = 60, tail = 25, direction = right, speed = 36)**:\n  - At \\(T = 54\\): span = \\([25 + 36 \\times (54 - 51), 60 + 36 \\times (54 - 51)] = [133, 168]\\). 0 \\(\\notin\\) \\([133, 168]\\) (safe).\n- **Freeway 7 (car: head = 96, tail = 49, direction = right, speed = 48)**:\n  - At \\(T = 55\\): span = \\([49 + 48 \\times (55 - 51), 96 + 48 \\times (55 - 51)] = [241, 288]\\). 0 \\(\\notin\\) \\([241, 288]\\) (safe).\n- **Freeway 8 (car: head = 96, tail = 49, direction = right, speed = 48)**:\n  - At \\(T = 56\\): span = \\([49 + 48 \\times (56 - 51), 96 + 48 \\times (56 - 51)] = [289, 336]\\). 0 \\(\\notin\\) \\([289, 336]\\) (safe).\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nA sequence of 6 consecutive \"U\" actions moves the player from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 6 turns:\n- At turn 51: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as the car on freeway 3 at \\(T = 51\\) has span \\([-41, -30]\\), and 0 \\(\\notin\\) \\([-41, -30]\\)).\n- After action \"U\" at turn 51: at turn 52, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe at \\(T = 52\\)).\n- After action \"U\" at turn 52: at turn 53, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe at \\(T = 53\\)).\n- After action \"U\" at turn 53: at turn 54, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 54\\)).\n- After action \"U\" at turn 54: at turn 55, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at \\(T = 55\\)).\n- After action \"U\" at turn 55: at turn 56, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at \\(T = 56\\)).\n- After action \"U\" at turn 56: at turn 57, \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached).\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 6\\) turns (actions from turn 51 to turn 56) and is minimal since 6 upward moves are required. No waiting (\"S\") or downward (\"D\") actions are needed, as the cars on the freeways do not pose a collision risk at the turns when the player is present.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: U \\\\\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t=54. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways 1 through 8, each with given positions, directions, and speeds. Collision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if they move to y_{T+1}, they are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T.\n\nThe car spans move over time based on their speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease in position, right-moving increase. All cars here are right-moving, based on the data:\n\n- Freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think. Let me read the car update rules.\n\nFor right-moving cars: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\" So tail τ and head h, with h > τ since it's right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (48, 37, right, 12). If it's right-moving, span should be [tail, head] so [37, 48]? But it's written as (head, tail) or (h, τ)? The notation is: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, h > τ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" with h > τ, so positions decrease.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12). Since direction is right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [37, 48], I assume, with τ=37, h=48.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). τ=-59, h=-48? But positions can be negative, I think, since cars move.\n\nτ and h are positions on the x-axis, I believe, and collision is when x=0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAll cars are right-moving except I need to confirm directions.\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) — so at t1=54, span is [37,48] for right-moving? No.\n\nDirection right: Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48] since τ=37, h=48.\n\nBut 37 to 48, and speed 12, so it moves right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). τ=-59, h=-48, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], moving right with speed 6.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36) τ=-83, h=-48? span [-83,-48]? But (-48, -83) so h=-48, τ=-83, so since right, span [τ,h] = [-83, -48]\n\nSpeed 36.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48) τ=-95, h=-48, span [-95,-48]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at t=54. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but the goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9 is the target.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9, moving through y=1 to 8, but avoiding being on a freeway when a car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince moving up or down, when you decide to move at turn T, you are on y_T for collision at turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if you are at y_T, and you choose action a_T, then:\n\n- If a_T = S, you stay at y_T, so for collision at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\n- If a_T = U or D, you move to y_{T+1} = y_T +1 or y_T -1, but at the moment of turn T, you are still on y_T for collision purposes. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the freeway you are leaving, you might be collided if 0 in span at T.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if player is on freeway k (y_T = k), and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is the car's position at turn T.\n\nNow, since all cars are moving, we need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe minimal H: since we start at y=0, need to reach y=9, each move changes y by at most 1, so minimally, we need at least 9 moves up, but we can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 9 if we need to avoid cars.\n\nThe shortest path would be to go directly up to 9, but we need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is in the car's span, so we know when it's unsafe to be on that freeway.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars per freeway? In the table, it lists \"Cars\" but for each freeway, it seems only one car is listed, or multiple? Looking at the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (h, τ, d, s) | \n\nFor k=1, it says (48,37,right,12) — one car.\n\nk=2: (-48,-59,right,6) one car.\n\nSimilarly for others. So I think each freeway has one car.\n\nk=3,4,5 same as k=2.\n\nk=6 different, k=7 and 8 same.\n\nSo freeways:\n\n- y=1: car with τ=37, h=48, d=right, s=12 at t1=54\n\n- y=2: car with τ=-59, h=-48, d=right, s=6\n\n- y=3: same as y=2: τ=-59, h=-48, d=right, s=6\n\n- y=4: same\n\n- y=5: same\n\n- y=6: car with τ=-83, h=-48, d=right, s=36\n\n- y=7: car with τ=-95, h=-48, d=right, s=48\n\n- y=8: same as y=7: τ=-95, h=-48, d=right, s=48\n\nFor y=2,3,4,5 all have identical cars: at t=54, span [-59,-48] for right-moving, so positions from -59 to -48.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 same.\n\nNow, for a car, the span at time T > t1 is:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it moves right.\n\nSimilarly, 0 is in Span(T) if τ + s(T-t1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-t1)\n\nBecause the span is inclusive, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo let t1 = 54.\n\nFor each freeway, find the times T when 0 is in Span(T).\n\nFirst, for freeway y=1:\n\nCar: τ=37, h=48, s=12, right\n\nSpan(T) = [37 + 12(T-54), 48 + 12(T-54)]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n37 + 12(T-54) ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12(T-54)\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: 37 + 12(T-54) ≤ 0\n\n12(T-54) ≤ -37\n\nT-54 ≤ -37/12 = -3.0833...\n\nSince T integer, T-54 ≤ -4? -37/12 = -3.083, so T-54 ≤ floor(-3.083) but inequality:\n\n12(T-54) ≤ -37\n\nSince 12>0, T-54 ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so T-54 ≤ -4? No:\n\nT-54 ≤ -37/12 = -3.083, since T integer, T-54 ≤ -4? -3.083, so T-54 ≤ -4 is true for T-54 ≤ -4, but for T-54 = -4, 12*(-4) = -48 ≤ -37? -48 ≤ -37 true.\n\nT-54 ≤ -3.083, so for integer T, T-54 ≤ -4? Let's compute numerically.\n\nSet Δt = T - t1 = T - 54\n\nThen 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ -37 => Δt ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so Δt ≤ -4 since Δt integer? Δt ≤ -3.083, so for integer Δt, Δt ≤ -4? -3.083, so Δt <= -4? Δt = -4: 12*(-4) = -48, 37-48 = -11 ≤ 0 true.\n\nΔt = -3: 12*(-3) = -36, 37-36=1 > 0? 37 + 12(-3) = 37 - 36 =1 >0, so not <=0.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt => 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt => 12 Δt ≥ -48? 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt => 12 Δt ≥ -48 => Δt ≥ -4.\n\nNow, both:\n\n37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt\n\nFrom above:\n\n37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0: since 37 + 12 Δt <=0, Δt <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so Δt <= -4 for integer Δt? Δt <= -4.\n\nΔt <= -3.083, so for integer, Δt <= -4? Let's list:\n\nIf Δt = -4: 37 + 12*(-4) = 37 - 48 = -11 <= 0 true\n\n0 <= 48 + 12*(-4) = 48 - 48 = 0 <=0 true, since 0 <=0, inclusive.\n\nIf Δt = -3: 37 + 12*(-3) = 37-36=1 >0, not <=0, false.\n\nIf Δt = -5: 37 + 12*(-5) = 37-60= -23 <=0 true, 0 <= 48-60= -12? 0 <= -12 false.\n\nSo only for Δt = -4: both true.\n\nΔt = T - t1 = T - 54\n\nSo for Δt = -4, T = 54 - 4 = 50.\n\nSo at T=50, 0 is in span for y=1.\n\nFor other T? Only T=50.\n\nNow, the player is at t=54, so for future turns, T>=54.\n\nFor T>=54, Δt >=0.\n\nFor Δt >=0, 37 + 12Δt >=37 >0, so 37+12Δt <=0 false for all Δt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 48+12Δt >=48>0, so 0<=48+12Δt always true, but first inequality false.\n\nSo for T>=54, no collision possible on y=1, because the car has moved past, since at t=54, span [37,48], and moving right, so 0 is left of 37, and car moving away, so never covers 0 for T>=54.\n\nSimilarly, at T=50 it was at 0, but we are at t=54, so not an issue.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at any time T>=54, it is safe to be on y=1, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, car τ=-59, h=-48, s=6, right\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 6(T-54), -48 + 6(T-54)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 6 Δt, with Δt = T-54\n\nSo:\n\n-59 + 6 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so Δt <= 9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6 Δt => 48 <= 6 Δt => Δt >= 48/6 = 8\n\nSo Δt >=8 and Δt <=9\n\nThus for Δt=8 and Δt=9\n\nT = t1 + Δt = 54 + 8 = 62 or 54 + 9 = 63\n\nSo at T=62 and T=63, 0 is in span for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3: same as y=2, since car identical, so also unsafe at T=62 and T=63.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=62,63\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at T=62,63\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6, car τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, right\n\nSpan(T) = [-83 + 36(T-54), -48 + 36(T-54)]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nFirst: -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 48 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt >= 2? Since integer.\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's see.\n\n0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 36 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so since Δt integer, Δt >= 2\n\nAnd first: -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2\n\nThus Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only Δt=2\n\nT = 54 + 2 = 56\n\nSo at T=56, unsafe for y=6.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, car τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, right\n\nSpan(T) = [-95 + 48(T-54), -48 + 48(T-54)]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 48 Δt\n\nFirst: -95 + 48 Δt <= 0 => 48 Δt <= 95 => Δt <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so Δt <= 1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 48 Δt => 48 <= 48 Δt => Δt >= 1\n\nThus Δt >=1 and Δt <=1, so only Δt=1\n\nT = 54 + 1 = 55\n\nSo at T=55, unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as y=7, so unsafe at T=55.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: never unsafe for T>=54\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=62,63\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=62,63\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=62,63\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=62,63\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=56\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=55\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=55\n\nWe start at t=54, position y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeway.\n\nThe minimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, with 8 freeways in between, but we can move at different times to avoid collisions.\n\nEach action changes the turn, and we need to be on certain y at certain times when it is safe.\n\nSince we start at t=54, y=0.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the car on that freeway at time t.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn T, but since we move step by step, we need to pass through the freeways.\n\nThe sequence: we start at t=54, y=0.\n\nIf we go directly up, we can reach y=9 in 9 turns: at t=54, y=0; after one up, t=55, y=1; t=56, y=2; ... up to t=63, y=9? Let's see:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nt=54: y=0\n\nAction a_{54}: if U, then y_{55} =1\n\nThen at turn t=55, y_t = y_{55} =1?

From above, y=1 is always safe for t>=54, so no collision.\n\nThen a_{55} = U, y_{56} =2\n\nAt turn t=56, y_t=2\n\ny=2, at t=56, is it unsafe? From above, y=2 unsafe at t=62,63, but t=56 is not 62 or 63, so should be safe? But we need to check for each time.\n\nFor y=2, unsafe only at t=62 and 63, so at t=56, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{56} = U, y_{57} =3\n\nt=57, y=3, safe since unsafe only at 62,63.\n\na_{57} = U, y_{58}=4\n\nt=58, y=4, safe.\n\na_{58} = U, y_{59}=5\n\nt=59, y=5, safe.\n\na_{59} = U, y_{60}=6\n\nt=60, y=6, now y=6 unsafe at t=56, but t=60, is it safe?\n\nFor y=6, unsafe only at t=56.\n\nAt t=60, span: Δt = t - 54 = 60-54=6\n\nSpan: τ + s Δt = -83 + 36*6 = -83 + 216 = 133\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 216 = 168\n\nSo [133,168], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{60} = U, y_{61}=7\n\nt=61, y=7, unsafe at t=55, t=61?\n\nFor y=7, unsafe at t=55.\n\nAt t=61, Δt=7, span: -95 +48*7 = -95 + 336=241, -48+336=288, [241,288], 0 not in, safe.\n\na_{61} = U, y_{62}=8\n\nt=62, y=8, now y=8 unsafe at t=55, but t=62?\n\ny=8 same as y=7, unsafe at t=55.\n\nAt t=62, Δt=8, span: -95 +48*8 = -95 + 384=289, -48+384=336, [289,336], 0 not in, safe? But unsafe only at t=55, so yes.\n\nBut at t=62, y=8 is safe, but y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe at t=62, but here y=8, different freeway.\n\nThen a_{62} = U, y_{63}=9\n\nt=63, y=9, which is not freeway, so safe.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=63? Let's list the positions:\n\nt=54: y=0\n\na54=U, y55=1\n\nt=55: y=1, safe (y=1 always safe)\n\na55=U, y56=2\n\nt=56: y=2, now y=2 unsafe at t=62,63? t=56 is not 62 or 63, so safe. At t=56, for y=2, span: Δt=56-54=2, τ + s Δt = -59 +6*2 = -59+12= -47, h + s Δt = -48 +12= -36? h=-48, s=6, Δt=2, so span: [-59 +12, -48 +12] = [-47, -36], so positions -47 to -36, 0 not in, since negative, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=56: y=2 safe.\n\na56=U, y57=3\n\nt=57: y=3, similarly, Δt=3, span [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\na57=U, y58=4\n\nt=58: y=4, Δt=4, span [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], safe.\n\na58=U, y59=5\n\nt=59: y=5, Δt=5, span [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18], safe.\n\na59=U, y60=6\n\nt=60: y=6, Δt=6, span for y=6: τ=-83, s=36, Δt=6, -83 + 36*6 = -83+216=133, h=-48+216=168, [133,168], 0 not in, safe.\n\na60=U, y61=7\n\nt=61: y=7, Δt=7, τ=-95, s=48, -95 + 48*7 = -95+336=241, h=-48+336=288, [241,288], safe.\n\na61=U, y62=8\n\nt=62: y=8, same as above, Δt=8, span [-95+384, -48+384] = [289,336], safe? But earlier we said y=8 unsafe at t=55 only.\n\nt=62 is fine.\n\nBut now, at t=62, y=8 is safe, but y=2 is unsafe at t=62, but we are on y=8, not y=2.\n\nThen a62=U, y63=9\n\nt=63: y=9, safe.\n\nSo we reached at turn t=63, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=54 to t=63, that's 10 turns? Let's see the actions.\n\nActions from t=54 to t=62, that's 9 actions: a54 to a62, each U, and after a62, y63=9.\n\nAt turn t=63, we are at y=9, so we have reached at turn t=63.\n\nThe sequence: turns involved: t=54 to t=63, that's 10 turns, but actions at t=54 to t=62, 9 actions, and position at t=63 is y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: H is the number of turns from start, including the start or after actions?\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"minimal number of turns H\".\n\nAlso, \"at turn t1 + H -1, y =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t1 to t= t1 + H -1, and at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions: a54 to a62 all U, at turn t=62 +1? After a62, at turn t=63, y=9.\n\nTurn t=63 is t1 + H -1, with t1=54, so 54 + H -1 =63, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nt1 + H -1 =63, t1=54, so 54 + H -1 =63, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut we can reach in fewer turns? Since we can go directly, but with 9 up moves, we need at least 9 actions, so H at least 10 turns? Let's see the turn indices.\n\nStart at turn t=54, position y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 54.\n\nAfter 1 action (a54), at turn 55, y=1 if U.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 54 + k, position y=k, if all U.\n\nTo be at y=9, we need after H-1 actions, at turn 54 + (H-1) = y=9.\n\nSo 54 + (H-1) = turn when y=9, and y=9 at that turn.\n\nMinimal H when we go directly up without delays.\n\nIn this case, with all U, at turn 54 + 8? After 8 actions: a54 to a61, at turn 55 to 62? Let's index:\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 54, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 55, y=1 (if a54=U)\n\nAfter 2 actions: turn 56, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 actions: turn 54 + 8 = 62, y=8? Actions from t=54 to t=61, that's 8 actions: a54 to a61.\n\nAfter a61, at turn 62, y= y_{62}, which if all U, y=8.\n\nThen we need another action to go to y=9.\n\na62=U, then at turn 63, y=9.\n\nSo after 9 actions, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nThus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nIs it possible to reach earlier? For example, if we start at y=0, we need to go to y=1 at some point.\n\nThe earliest to be at y=9 is turn 54 + 9 =63 if we go up every turn, but at turn 63.\n\nCan we be at y=9 earlier? Only if we can skip, but no, we move one y per action, so minimum 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9, so minimum 10 turns: start at t=54, end at t=63.\n\nBut in the direct path above, we had no collisions, so it should be possible in H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we had issue.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=55: y=1, safe\n\nt=56: y=2, safe (as span [-47,-36])\n\nt=57: y=3, span [-41,-30]? For y=2,3,4,5 same car, but at different times.\n\nAt t=57, for y=3, since freeway 3 same as 2, span: Δt=57-54=3, τ=-59, s=6, span [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, t=58: y=4, Δt=4, [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], safe\n\nt=59: y=5, [-29,-18], safe\n\nt=60: y=6, [133,168], safe\n\nt=61: y=7, [241,288], safe\n\nt=62: y=8, [289,336], safe\n\nThen t=63: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collision at any point.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at t=63.\n\nBut H=10, with actions from t=54 to t=62.\n\nBut is there a way with less? For example, if we could go faster, but no, we can only change by 1 each move.\n\nPerhaps start later, but we need to minimize H, so earlier is better.\n\nH is the number of turns, so smaller H is better.\n\nMinimal H is 10 for direct up.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in fewer than 9 actions? From y=0 to y=9, must have 9 up moves, so at least 9 actions, so H at least 10.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at turn 54, but we are at y=0, so no.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the actions, we have all U, but perhaps we need to avoid the unsafe times, but in this case, no issue.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times: for example, at t=55, y=7 is unsafe, but we are not on y=7 at t=55.\n\nSimilarly, t=56, y=6 unsafe, but we are on y=2 at t=56.\n\nt=62, y=2 unsafe, but we are on y=8 at t=62.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFrom t=54 to t=62, each action U.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns starting from t1=54.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nNow, H=10, sequence of 9 actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut is this correct? But let's double-check if at any point we might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, at turn t=55: we are at y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at t=55, but we are not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nPerhaps for freeway with multiple cars, but here each has one car.\n\nAnother thing: the car on y=6 is unsafe at t=56, but at t=56 we are on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSo fine.\n\nBut the player position: at turn t, y_t.\n\nIn the sequence above, all good.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nBut perhaps we can do with H=9? Is it possible?\n\nIf we could be at y=9 at turn 62, for example.\n\nAt turn 62, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 62, that means at turn 62, position y=9.\n\nBut we start at turn 54, y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 54+k.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, stay keeps, down decreases.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9 in m moves, we need exactly 9 up moves, and possibly some stay or down, but that would take more moves, so minimum 9 moves with 9 up, no down or stay.\n\nSo with 9 up moves, we reach y=9 at turn 54 + 9 = 63.\n\nIf we have down or stay, it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we stay or go down, y increases slower.\n\nSo minimal turns: start turn 54, after 9 actions, turn 63, y=9.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nThus H=10 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, no need to avoid anything since no collision in direct path.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFor example, at t=55, y=7 unsafe, but if someone were on y=7 at t=55, collision, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, at t=56, y=6 unsafe, but we are on y=2.\n\nAt t=62, y=2 unsafe, but we are on y=8.\n\nt=63, y=2 unsafe, but we are on y=9.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=3,4,5 also unsafe at t=62,63, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nSo the direct path works.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from t=54 to t=62.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) at t=54, and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=54 to t=62.\n\nH=10, since turns from t=54 to t=63, but t=63 is when we are at (0,9), after actions.\n\nThe sequence should be actions for turns t=54 to t=54 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are for t from t1 to t1 + H -2, I think.\n\nStandard: actions at t = t1, t1+1, ..., t1 + H -2, and at turn t1 + H -1, position reached.\n\nFor example, here t1=54, H=10, actions at t=54 to t=54 + 8? t1 to t1 + (H-1) -1? Actions from t=0 to H-1 relative.\n\nSet relative time.\n\nLet τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, turn t1, position (0,0)\n\nAction a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, position should be (0,9)\n\nIn this case, for τ from 0 to 8, a_{t1+τ} = U, then at τ=9, turn t1+9, y=9.\n\nt1+9 =54+9=63.\n\nYes.\n\nH=10, actions for τ=0 to 8.\n\nNow, in the answer, list the actions for each turn.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 63.\n\nBut is there any reason to not go directly? For example, if we delay, it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to avoid, but here no need.\n\nBut let's see freeway 1: we passed at t=55, which is fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about unsafe times, but in direct path, we avoid them naturally.\n\nPerhaps for y=2,3,4,5, they are unsafe at t=62 and 63, but at t=62 we are on y=8, not on them, and at t=63 we are on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, this should be the solution.\n\nBut the car on y=6 at t=56 is unsafe, but we are on y=2 at t=56, so not affected.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have 9 actions, all U.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine H and the sequence\", but H is 10.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the sequence, not H, but we need to state H? No, the format is just the sequence, I think.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t1 + 1} ... }\"\n\nAnd in the sequence, it implies H.\n\nBut we need to specify H? The problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the format, only sequence is listed, so probably H is not in the box, but we should know.\n\nPerhaps in the sequence, the last action leads to the position.\n\nAnyway, for this case.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway y=2,3,4,5, all have the same car? But in the table, for k=2,3,4,5, each has a car with same parameters, so each freeway has a separate car with same properties, so for y=2, car at t=62,63 unsafe, similarly for y=3, etc.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=2 at t=56, which is safe, and not on at t=62,63.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower to avoid, but no need, since we can go fast.\n\nBut in this case, direct is fastest.\n\nPerhaps at t=55, if we were to be on y=7, it would be bad, but we are not.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and sequence all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut H=10 turns, from turn 54 to 63, with actions at 54 to 62.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's see if we need to specify that we reach at turn 63.\n\nBut the sequence implies.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we start with stay or something, but that would delay, so H larger.\n\nNo.\n\nDown move? But that would make y smaller, take more moves to reach 9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nThus, this should be it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 54\\) is 10. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t = 54\\) to \\(t = 62\\), resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 63\\) (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 54 + 10 - 1 = 63\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) because:\n- At each turn, the player is on a freeway that is safe (no car has a span containing 0 at that turn).\n- The unsafe times for each freeway (when 0 is in a car's span) are:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): never unsafe for \\(t \\geq 54\\)\n  - \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\): unsafe at \\(t = 62\\) and \\(t = 63\\)\n  - \\(y = 6\\): unsafe at \\(t = 56\\)\n  - \\(y = 7, 8\\): unsafe at \\(t = 55\\)\n- In the sequence, the player is on:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 55\\) (safe)\n  - \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 56\\) (safe, as unsafe at \\(t = 62, 63\\))\n  - \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 57\\) (safe)\n  - \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 58\\) (safe)\n  - \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 59\\) (safe)\n  - \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 60\\) (safe, as unsafe at \\(t = 56\\))\n  - \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 61\\) (safe, as unsafe at \\(t = 55\\))\n  - \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 62\\) (safe, as unsafe at \\(t = 55\\))\n\nThus, no collision occurs, and \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn \\(t = 63\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: U \\\\\nTurn 57: U \\\\\nTurn 58: U \\\\\nTurn 59: U \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 57, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- U: y increases by 1 (up)\n- D: y decreases by 1 (down)\n- S: stay (y remains)\n\nCollision condition: \nAt turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and y_T is a freeway (i.e., between 1 and 8), then we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T. The car's span at turn T must not contain 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant note: \nWhen moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T (when we are still at y_T) we are only on freeway y_T. Then at turn T+1, we are on freeway y_{T+1} (if applicable). So when we move, we are only on one freeway per turn.\n\nGoal: \nWe start at y=3 at turn 57. We need to get to y=9 (which is not a freeway, so no car check at y=9). However, we must pass through freeways 4,5,6,7,8 to get to 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nGiven the car state at turn 57 (current turn):\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8), we have one car described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note: \n- For left-moving (if direction is left), the car moves left (negative x direction). \n- For right-moving (direction right), the car moves right (positive x direction).\n\nBut note the representation:\n- Left-moving: at turn t1, span = [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: at turn t1, span = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the given car state is at turn 57. Let's interpret:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) \n  Since it's right-moving, the initial span at turn57 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36] (because tail is -47 and head is -36). Then at turn T, the span becomes: [ -47 + 12*(T-57), -36 + 12*(T-57) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> initial span at turn57: [-41, -30] (because tail is -41, head is -30). Then at T: [ -41 + 6*(T-57), -30 + 6*(T-57) ]\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: same as freeway 2? \n  Yes, same data: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> so same as freeway2.\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36) -> initial span: [25,60] (because tail=25, head=60). Then at T: [25 + 36*(T-57), 60 + 36*(T-57)]\n\nFreeway 7: (96,49,right,48) -> initial span: [49,96] -> at T: [49+48*(T-57), 96+48*(T-57)]\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn57. We are not on a freeway? \nNote: freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The player is at y=3, which is freeway 3. So at turn57, we are on freeway3. We must check the car on freeway3 at turn57.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn57:\nCar on freeway3: initial span = [-41, -30] (from the data: tail=-41, head=-30, and direction right -> so [τ, h] = [-41, -30]).\nIs 0 in [-41, -30]? No, because -30 is less than 0? Actually, -41 <= x <= -30, and 0 is not in that interval. So we are safe at turn57.\n\nBut note: we are going to move. We need to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn57. We want to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves in terms of vertical steps is 6 (if we go up 6 times). But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (from 1 to 8) at a turn when a car on that row has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns. We need to know at each turn T (>=57) and for each freeway k, the car's span at T.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways we might step on. Since we start at 3 and go to 9, we will step on rows 3,4,5,6,7,8. We don't need to consider row1 and row2 because we are starting at row3 and going up, so we won't go to row1 or row2.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? However, going down from 3 would take us to 2,1,0. But 0 is the bottom and we are going to 9, so going down would be counterproductive. So we will only move up or stay.\n\nSo the plan: we must go from 3 to 9: so we need 6 net up moves. But we might have to insert some stays to avoid cars.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn, starting at turn57 (current turn, y=3). We have to choose an action at each turn: U, D, or S. But since we are only going up, we consider only U and S (D is not helpful).\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we are on at a given turn.\n\nLet T = turn number (starting at 57, then 58, ...). Let y_T be our y-coordinate at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T. If y_T is between 1 and 8, we must check the car on freeway y_T at turn T: the car's span must not contain 0.\n\nWe start at T0 = 57, y57 = 3 (freeway3). We already checked: at T=57, freeway3 car span is [-41, -30] -> doesn't contain 0 -> safe.\n\nNow, we choose an action for T=57: \nWe can choose U (then at T=58, y58=4) or S (then at T=58, y58=3) or D (but D would take us to 2, which is freeway2, but we don't want to go down). So we consider U and S.\n\nOur goal is to minimize the number of turns. So we prefer to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. So let's compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (from 3 to 8) and for turns T>=57, the span of the car on that freeway.\n\nFreeway3: car = (-30, -41, right, 6) -> note: the given data: head=-30, tail=-41? But in the representation for right-moving, the initial span is [tail, head] = [-41, -30]. So:\n  At turn T: [ -41 + 6*(T-57), -30 + 6*(T-57) ]\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? The table says freeway4: (-30,-41,right,6) -> same as freeway3.\n\nFreeway5: same.\n\nFreeway6: (60,25,right,36) -> initial span: [25,60] -> at T: [25+36*(T-57), 60+36*(T-57)]\n\nFreeway7: (96,49,right,48) -> initial span: [49,96] -> at T: [49+48*(T-57), 96+48*(T-57)]\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7.\n\nWe are going to move from y=3 to y=9. The path we take: we will be on y=3 for some turns, then y=4, then y=5, then y=6, then y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways we are on. So when we are at y=k (for k in {3,4,5,6,7,8}) at turn T, we must ensure that the car on freeway k at turn T does not have 0 in its span.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=57) the interval [L_k(T), R_k(T)] for the car on freeway k.\n\nWe'll denote:\n- For freeway3,4,5: \n    L(T) = -41 + 6*(T-57)\n    R(T) = -30 + 6*(T-57)\n\n- For freeway6:\n    L(T) = 25 + 36*(T-57)\n    R(T) = 60 + 36*(T-57)\n\n- For freeway7,8:\n    L(T) = 49 + 48*(T-57)\n    R(T) = 96 + 48*(T-57)\n\nWe are at T=57, y=3: we are safe (as above).\n\nWe have to plan the next moves. We want to get to y=9 as fast as possible, so we want to use U as much as possible. But we might have to wait at a row if the next row is dangerous at the next turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate:\n\nTurn 57: at y=3 -> safe. We can choose:\n  Option1: U -> then at T=58, y=4 -> then we check freeway4 at T=58.\n  Option2: S -> then at T=58, y=3 -> check freeway3 at T=58.\n\nWe need to check freeway3 at T=58: \n  L(58) = -41 + 6*(1) = -35\n  R(58) = -30 + 6 = -24\n  Interval [-35,-24] -> does not contain 0 -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at T=58: same car as freeway3? Actually, freeway4 has the same car: same parameters. So at T=58, freeway4 car: [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\nSo both options are safe at T=58? But if we go up, we'll be at y=4 at T=58. If we stay, we remain at y=3.\n\nBut we want to minimize turns, so we prefer to go up.\n\nSo at T=57: choose U -> then T=58: y=4.\n\nNow at T=58: we are at y=4 -> check freeway4 at T=58: safe (as above).\n\nNow we choose action for T=58: \n  U: then at T=59, y=5 -> check freeway5 at T=59.\n  S: then at T=59, y=4 -> check freeway4 at T=59.\n\nCheck freeway4 at T=59: \n  L(59)= -41+6*(2)= -41+12 = -29\n  R(59)= -30+12 = -18 -> interval [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at T=59: same as freeway4? Actually, freeway5 has the same car parameters. So at T=59, freeway5: same [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go up again.\n\nAction T=58: U -> then T=59: y=5.\n\nNow at T=59: y=5 -> check freeway5: safe.\n\nAction for T=59: \n  U: then T=60: y=6 -> check freeway6 at T=60.\n  S: then T=60: y=5 -> check freeway5 at T=60.\n\nCheck freeway5 at T=60: \n  L(60)= -41+6*(3)= -41+18=-23\n  R(60)= -30+18=-12 -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at T=60: \n  L(60)=25+36*(3)=25+108=133\n  R(60)=60+108=168\n  [133,168] -> does not contain 0? 0 is not in [133,168] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go up.\n\nAction T=59: U -> then T=60: y=6.\n\nNow at T=60: y=6 -> check freeway6: safe (as above).\n\nAction for T=60:\n  U: then T=61: y=7 -> check freeway7 at T=61.\n  S: then T=61: y=6 -> check freeway6 at T=61.\n\nCheck freeway6 at T=61:\n  L(61)=25+36*(4)=25+144=169\n  R(61)=60+144=204 -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at T=61:\n  L(61)=49+48*(4)=49+192=241\n  R(61)=96+192=288 -> safe.\n\nSo we can go up.\n\nAction T=60: U -> then T=61: y=7.\n\nAt T=61: y=7 -> check freeway7: safe.\n\nAction for T=61:\n  U: then T=62: y=8 -> check freeway8 at T=62.\n  S: then T=62: y=7 -> check freeway7 at T=62.\n\nCheck freeway7 at T=62:\n  L(62)=49+48*(5)=49+240=289\n  R(62)=96+240=336 -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at T=62: same as freeway7? Actually, freeway8 has the same car parameters. So at T=62, freeway8: [49+48*5, 96+48*5] = [289,336] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go up.\n\nAction T=61: U -> then T=62: y=8.\n\nAt T=62: y=8 -> check freeway8: safe.\n\nAction for T=62:\n  U: then T=63: y=9 -> we are done (y=9 is not a freeway, so no check needed).\n\nSo we can go up.\n\nAction T=62: U -> then at T=63: y=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions from turn57 to turn62 (6 turns) is: \n  T57: U\n  T58: U\n  T59: U\n  T60: U\n  T61: U\n  T62: U\n\nBut wait, we started at T57 at y=3, and we did 6 U's: \n  T57: y=3 -> U -> y=4 at T58\n  T58: y=4 -> U -> y=5 at T59\n  T59: y=5 -> U -> y=6 at T60\n  T60: y=6 -> U -> y=7 at T61\n  T61: y=7 -> U -> y=8 at T62\n  T62: y=8 -> U -> y=9 at T63\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn T63. That's H=7 turns? Because we start at T57 and go to T63: \n  T57: action0\n  T58: action1\n  T59: action2\n  T60: action3\n  T61: action4\n  T62: action5\n  T63: we are at y=9, but we don't need an action at T63 because we are already at the goal? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from T57 to T57+H-1. We start at T57 and we need H turns (actions) to reach the goal at T57+H-1. So we want the last action to be at turn T57+H-1 that puts us at y=9.\n\nWe are at T57: y=3. After H-1 actions, we are at T57+H-1, and we want y=9.\n\nIn our plan, we have 6 actions (all U) and we are at y=9 at turn T57+6 = 63. So H-1 = 6? Then H=7. But actually, we have 6 actions: T57, T58, T59, T60, T61, T62. So H=6? \n\nLet me clarify: \nAt the start of turn T57, we are at (0,3). We take an action at T57, then at T58 we are at a new state. After the last action at T57+5 (if we do 6 actions) we would be at T57+6. But we want to be at (0,9) at the end of the last action.\n\nIn our sequence:\n  After T57 (action U): at T58, we are at (0,4)\n  After T58 (action U): at T59, we are at (0,5)\n  After T59 (action U): at T60, we are at (0,6)\n  After T60 (action U): at T61, we are at (0,7)\n  After T61 (action U): at T62, we are at (0,8)\n  After T62 (action U): at T63, we are at (0,9)\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the start of turn T63? Or at the end of turn T62? \n\nThe game says: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T, and then we update to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T. Then we do action a_T, and then at the beginning of turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn T57, we are at (0,3). We do action a57 (U) and then at the beginning of turn58, we are at (0,4).\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T63. So we need 6 actions: at T57, T58, T59, T60, T61, T62. Then at T63 we are at (0,9). \n\nSo H=6? But note the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\" such that after the last action we are at (0,9). \n\nSo we take actions at t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nWait: the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. After the action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. So if we take an action at turn t, then at the next turn (t+1) we are at y_{t+1}. \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 (57) at (0,3). We take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? And then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9) without having taken an action that turn? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo the sequence of actions starts at t1 (t=0) and goes to t1+H-1 (t=H-1). And we require that at turn t1+H-1 (after the last action) we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is the last action, and after that action we update to the next turn. So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at some state, then we take an action, and then at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at the next state. \n\nBut the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. That means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut that would be before taking the action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nI think there is a confusion in the problem statement. \n\nLooking back: \n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut in the game dynamics, the position at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action, and that action updates the state for the next turn.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, it determines y_{t+1}. \n\nTherefore, if we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, then at turn t1+H we are at the new state. \n\nBut the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. That would mean that we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, without having taken an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThat doesn't match because we start at turn t1 at (0,3). \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nLet me check the example: if we do nothing (H=1), then we are at (0,3) at turn t1 (57). But we want to be at (0,9). So H must be at least 6? \n\nBut the problem says: we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So if H=1, we take one action at t1. Then after that action, at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at a new state. \n\nBut we want that new state to be (0,9)? Then we would be at (0,9) at turn t1+1. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nIf H=1, then we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+0 = t1. But we start at t1 at (0,3), so unless we are already at (0,9) we cannot have H=1.\n\nSo the interpretation must be: we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the turn after the last action we are at (0,9). That turn is t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nI see: the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". And we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nThis implies that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we do not need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nThe indexing is: \nt = 0,1,...,H-1: so actions at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nAnd then at turn t1+H-1, after taking the last action, we are at (0,9) at the next turn? But the problem says at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis is inconsistent. \n\nLooking at the game dynamics: \n- At turn t, we are at y_t.\n- We take action a_t, which updates to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then we are at (0, y_{t+1}) at turn t+1.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, it affects our position at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that put us there.\n\nSo if we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we must have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us to 9. \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which would then affect turn t1+H. \n\nSo how can we be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe only way is if we are already at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we don't need to take an action? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis suggests that the problem means that after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the problem statement again: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut then in the answer format, we list actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the note: \"after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at the next turn (t1+H)\".\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", not at turn t1+H.\n\nAlternatively, it might be a off-by-one in the problem.\n\nGiven the car update rules and the example, I think the intended meaning is: \nWe start at turn t1. We take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", so that might be a mistake.\n\nAnother possibility: \"turn t1+H-1\" is the last turn at which we take an action, and then immediately after that action (still within turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). But the game dynamics say that the position at the beginning of turn t is before the action.\n\nI think there is a misinterpretation. Let me check the example in the problem: \nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t. So the position at turn t+1 is determined by the action at turn t.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn t determines y_{t+1}, which is the position at the next turn.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, then at turn t+1 we are at the new position.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have that the action at turn T-1 moved us to 9.\n\nIn our case, we start at turn t1 at (0,3). We want to be at (0,9) at turn T = t1+H-1. \nThis means that the action at turn T-1 = t1+H-2 moved us to 9. \n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9), and we do not need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence requires an action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \nWe take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). \n\nBecause that is the natural way: after H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) we have moved from (0,3) to (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut then the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", but that would be before the last action.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then at turn t1+H-1 (after the action) we are at (0,9). But the game dynamics don't work that way.\n\nGiven the confusion, and because in our simulation we have a safe path that gets us to (0,9) at turn t1+6 (i.e., 57+6=63), and we took actions at turns 57,58,59,60,61,62 (6 actions), then H=6, and we are at (0,9) at turn 63 = t1+6 = t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we should be at turn t1+H-1 = 57+5=62. \n\nSo if the problem requires to be at (0,9) at turn 62, then we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn 62. How can we do that? We start at turn57 at y=3. We need to be at y=9 at turn62. That means we have 5 actions (at turns57,58,59,60,61) to move from 3 to 9: that requires 6 steps up, but we only have 5 actions? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem means that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at the next turn (t1+H). But then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t1+H, not t1+H-1.\n\nGiven the answer format and the natural interpretation, I will output the sequence that gets us to (0,9) at turn63 (t1+6) with 6 actions (H=6).\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 6.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any collision in our plan? We did a quick simulation and saw that at every turn we were safe. But let me verify the freeway we are on at each turn:\n\nTurn57: y=3 -> freeway3: car at T=57: [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\nTurn58: y=4 -> freeway4: car at T=58: [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nTurn59: y=5 -> freeway5: car at T=59: [-41+6*2, -30+6*2] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nTurn60: y=6 -> freeway6: car at T=60: [25+36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108,60+108]=[133,168] -> safe.\n\nTurn61: y=7 -> freeway7: car at T=61: [49+48*4, 96+48*4]=[49+192,96+192]=[241,288] -> safe.\n\nTurn62: y=8 -> freeway8: car at T=62: [49+48*5, 96+48*5]=[49+240,96+240]=[289,336] -> safe.\n\nAnd then after the action at turn62 (U), we go to y=9 at turn63.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is:\n\nTurn57: U\nTurn58: U\nTurn59: U\nTurn60: U\nTurn61: U\nTurn62: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn62 = t1+5 (since t1=57, 57+5=62). And we have H=6 actions? Actually, the actions are from t=0 to t=5 (6 actions: t=0,1,2,3,4,5) for turns 57,58,59,60,61,62.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U\nTurn 58: a_{58} = U\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U\nTurn 62: a_{62} = U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here, H=6, so t from 0 to 5.\n\nBut the turn labels: \nt=0 -> turn57\nt=1 -> turn58\n...\nt=5 -> turn62.\n\nSo it matches.\n\nBut the problem says: we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 57+5 = 62? But we are at (0,9) at turn63, not turn62.\n\nHowever, at turn62, we are at y=8 (as per our simulation). Then we take action U at turn62, and then at turn63 we are at y=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn62, we are at y=8. We take action U, and then at the beginning of turn63, we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we are not at (0,9) at turn62 (t1+H-1=62) but at turn63.\n\nThis indicates that the problem might have intended H to be 7? But then we would have to output 7 actions, and the last action at turn63 would be unnecessary because we are already at the goal? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that we are done when we reach (0,9) and do not need an action after that. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo if we want to be at (0,9) at turn62, then we must have taken an action at turn61 that moved us to 9. But at turn61 we were at y=7. One U would take us to y=8 at turn62. We cannot get to y=9 at turn62 from y=7 in one action: because at turn61 we can only move to y=8 at turn62.\n\nSo it's impossible to be at (0,9) at turn62.\n\nTherefore, I suspect the problem means that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. \n\nAnd the turn t1+H-1 is the last turn we take an action, but we are at (0,9) at the next turn.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which is the turn we are taking the action, not the turn we appear at (0,9).\n\nGiven the constraints, I think we should output the safe sequence we found.\n\nPerhaps the problem's \"reach at turn t1+H-1\" means the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). Then we would have to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn62. \n\nTo be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn62, we must have taken an action at turn61 that moved us from y=8 at turn61 to y=9 at turn62. \n\nBut then what about turn61? At turn61, we were at y=8? But how did we get to y=8 at turn61? \n\nWe start at turn57: y=3.\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn62 (beginning).\n\nSo the moves:\n\nTurn57: action -> to y at turn58\nTurn58: action -> to y at turn59\nTurn59: action -> to y at turn60\nTurn60: action -> to y at turn61\nTurn61: action -> to y at turn62 (9)\n\nWe have 5 actions (H-1 = 5? because the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions?).\n\nWe need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps. We have 5 actions. So we must move up 6 times in 5 actions? Impossible because each action can move at most 1.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to be at (0,9) at turn62.\n\nThe earliest we can be at (0,9) is turn63.\n\nTherefore, the problem must mean that we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+6 = 63.\n\nSo we output the sequence for 6 actions.\n\nPerhaps the problem's \"H\" is the number of turns including the starting turn? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\nI think we have to go with our simulation.\n\nSo final answer: 6 actions, as above.\n\nBut to be safe, let me see if there is any car that might have been miscalculated.\n\nOne thing: the car on freeway6: at turn60, we have [133,168] -> safe. But what about the speed? 36 per turn. And the car is moving right. At turn57, the car was at [25,60]. After 3 turns (57 to 60), it moves 36*3=108, so 25+108=133, 60+108=168.\n\nSimilarly for freeway7 at turn61: 4 turns after 57: 48*4=192, 49+192=241, 96+192=288.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think the answer is the sequence of 6 U's.\n\nBut the problem has freeway1 to freeway8, and freeway3,4,5 have the same car? Yes, and we are safe on them.\n\nOne more thing: at turn57, freeway3 car is [-41,-30] -> safe. But note that the car is moving right at speed 6. At turn58, freeway3 car is [-35,-24] -> safe. But we are not on freeway3 at turn58 if we moved up to freeway4.\n\nIn our plan, at turn58 we are on freeway4, and the car on freeway4 is the same as freeway3? The car on freeway4 is a different car, but with the same parameters. So at turn58, freeway4 car: [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway5 at turn59: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\n}\n\nBut to match the format: the actions are labeled by the turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U\nTurn 58: a_{58} = U\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U\nTurn 62: a_{62} = U\n\nAnd H=6.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 57\\) is 6.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 60, and I start at y=0. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nImportant point: when I move to a new y-position, I'm not considered on that new freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 with minimal turns, so I should try to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states for each freeway at t_1=60.\n\nFreeway 1: car (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nGiven head h and tail τ, with h > τ since it's moving right, I assume.\n\nIn the initial state, for freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nSince it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think. 48 > 37, so that makes sense. Span at t_1 is [37,48] I think, but let's see the update.\n\nAt turn t_1, the span is given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ=37, h=48, so [37,48].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [37 + 12(T-60), 48 + 12(T-60)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I'm on freeway k at that turn, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nFor freeway k, there is one car, I think, from the table. Each freeway has one car listed, so I assume one car per freeway.\n\nNow, freeway 1: car with τ=37, h=48, s=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12(T-60), 48 + 12(T-60)]\n\n0 is in span if 37 + 12(T-60) ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12(T-60)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns the car would be at position 0, meaning collision if I'm on that freeway.\n\nBut since I move, I need to avoid being on a freeway when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nNow, the position 0 is fixed; it's the x-coordinate we care about, I think. The grid is 2D, but the player is always at x=0, I assume, since position is (0, y_t), so we're moving vertically, and cars are moving horizontally, and collision is when the car's span includes x=0 at the time we're on that y-level.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each freeway, find the times T when 0 is in the car's span at that freeway.\n\nThen, for each turn, when I'm on a certain y, I must not be on that y when it's dangerous for that y.\n\nBut since I might be on different y at different times, I need to plan my path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the interval of T when collision can happen.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12(T-60), 48 + 12(T-60)]\n\n0 in span: lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper\n\nSo 37 + 12(T-60) ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12(T-60)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 12(T-60) ≤ 0\n\n12(T-60) ≤ -37\n\nT-60 ≤ -37/12 = -3.0833, so T ≤ 60 - 3.0833 = 56.9167, but since T is integer turn, T ≤ 56?

Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nStart at t=60, y=0.\n\nAfter one up, t=61, y=1\n\nt=62, y=2\n\n...\n\nt=68, y=8?

So safe.\n\nt=62, y=2: freeway 2, danger at T=68,69? T=62 is not 68 or 69, and for freeway 2, danger only at T=68,69, so at t=62, no danger. Similarly, freeway 2 is safe except T=68,69.\n\nt=62: y=2, freeway 2, T=62 not dangerous, safe.\n\nt=63, y=3: freeway 3, same as freeway 2, danger only T=68,69, T=63 not, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=64, y=4: freeway 4, safe except T=68,69.\n\nt=65, y=5: freeway 5, safe except T=68,69.\n\nt=66, y=6: freeway 6, danger at T=62. But t=66, not 62, and freeway 6 danger only at T=62, so safe.\n\nt=67, y=7: freeway 7, danger at T=61. t=67 not 61, and only T=61 dangerous, so safe.\n\nt=68, y=8: freeway 8, danger at T=61. t=68 not 61, safe? Freeway 8 danger at T=61, only.\n\nThen t=69, y=9: no freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=68, y=8, freeway 8 is dangerous only at T=61, so at t=68, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all seem safe except... what about t=61 for y=7? But at t=61, I'm at y=1, not y=7.\n\nIn this path:\n\n- t=61: y=1, safe\n\n- t=62: y=2, safe (since danger only at 68,69 for y=2)\n\n- t=63: y=3, safe\n\n- t=64: y=4, safe\n\n- t=65: y=5, safe\n\n- t=66: y=6, safe (danger only at T=62)\n\n- t=67: y=7, safe (danger only at T=61)\n\n- t=68: y=8, safe (danger only at T=61)\n\n- t=69: y=9, safe\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at t=69.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=68 or something? No, all safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous turns.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, danger at T=62\n\nBut at t=66, y=6, T=66 ≠62, safe.\n\ny=7: danger at T=61, t=67 ≠61, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=68 ≠61, safe.\n\nAnd y=2 to 5 only dangerous at T=68,69, but at t=62 to65, I'm on y=2 to5, but T=62-65 not 68 or69, so safe.\n\nSo actually, going straight up seems fine, and I reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster?\n\nMinimum turns: from y=0 to y=9, I need at least 9 up moves, so 9 turns to reach y=9 at t=69.\n\nI could go faster? But I can only move one step per turn, so minimum 9 actions to go from 0 to 9.\n\nUnless I start moving earlier, but at t=60 I'm at y=0, so I must take actions to increase y.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, S or D don't, so to increase by 9, I need at least 9 U actions, and since I start at t=60, the earliest to reach y=9 is t=69.\n\nI could have some S or D, but that would only delay, so 9 turns with all U is minimum.\n\nIn this case, with the car positions, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I might be on a dangerous spot.\n\nFor example, at t=61, I'm on y=1, freeway 1: car span at t=61: for freeway 1, at T=61, as before, [37+12(1)=49, 48+12=60], [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=62, y=2, freeway 2: car at t=62, span: [-59 +6(62-60)= -59 +6(2)= -59+12= -47, upper -48+12= -36? Earlier for freeway 2 at T=62.\n\nt_1=60, T=62, T-t_1=2\n\nlower: τ + s(T-t_1) = -59 +6(2) = -59+12= -47\n\nupper: h + s(T-t_1) = -48 +12= -36\n\nspan [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are later, but I'm not there at those times.\n\nAt t=68, I'm at y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=68: danger only at T=61, but T=68, so should be safe.\n\nCar on freeway 8: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nAt T=68, T-t_1=68-60=8\n\nspan: [τ + s(8), h + s(8)] = [-95 + 48*8, -48 + 48*8] = [-95 + 384, -48 + 384] = [289, 336], far from 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=6 at t=62? At t=62, in my path, I'm at y=2, not y=6.\n\ny=6 is dangerous at t=62, but I'm not on y=6 at t=62; I'm on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 dangerous at t=61, I'm on y=1 at t=61.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with all U moves, I can reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions starting from t_1.\n\nSo actions from t=60 to t=68, 9 actions, all U, to be at y=9 at t=69.\n\nt=60: action U, to y=1 at t=61\n\n...\n\nt=68: action U, to y=9 at t=69\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position.\n\nt_1=60, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nDefine: after t actions from t_1, at turn t_1 + t, position.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =0\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1+1}, at turn t_1+2, position, and so on.\n\nTo be at position (0,9) at some turn, say at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nWith all U, at turn t_1 + H, y=H, since start from 0.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + H} =9, so H=9, at turn 69.\n\nActions from t=60 to t=68: a_{60} to a_{68}, all U.\n\nThen at t=69, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, I think.\n\nThe answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9)\n\nSo for H=9, actions from t=60 to 68.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? No, because I need to gain 9 in y, each U gains one, so minimum 9 actions.\n\nI could use D or S, but that would require more actions or same, not less.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=69, I reach y=9, but the turn when I reach is t=69, which is after H actions.\n\nIn the collision, is there any issue at the points?\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am on the previous y until the next turn.\n\nBut in collision check, at turn T, I am on y_T, and we check if for that freeway, if y_T between 1 and 8, car span includes 0.\n\nIn my path:\n\n- T=60: y=0, no freeway, safe\n\n- T=61: y=1, freeway 1 safe\n\n- T=62: y=2, freeway 2 safe (span [-47,-36] not include 0)\n\n- T=63: y=3, freeway 3, similarly safe\n\n- T=64: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\n- T=65: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\n- T=66: y=6, freeway 6, at T=66: car span: for freeway 6, τ=-83, s=36, T-t_1=6\n\nlower: -83 +36*6 = -83 + 216 = 133\n\nupper: -48 + 216 = 168\n\n[133,168], not 0, safe. Danger only at T=62.\n\n- T=67: y=7, freeway 7, at T=67: τ=-95, s=48, T-t_1=7\n\nlower: -95 + 48*7 = -95 + 336 = 241\n\nupper: -48 + 336 = 288, not 0, safe. Danger only at T=61.\n\n- T=68: y=8, freeway 8, similarly, at T=68, span [289,336], not 0, safe.\n\n- T=69: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut I think I missed something. Freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous at T=68 and 69.\n\nAt T=68 and 69, if I am on y=2,3,4,5, collision.\n\nBut in my path, at T=68, I am on y=8, not on y=2-5.\n\nAt T=69, I am on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and in this case H=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can do it in fewer turns? Impossible, since I need to increase y by 9.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at 0.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see the car for freeway 6 and 7 at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at T=62, y=6 is dangerous, but I'm not there.\n\nSimilarly, T=61, y=7 dangerous, not there.\n\nT=68, y=2-5 dangerous, but I'm on y=8.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by not going straight, but I can't, because I must go through each y, and minimum steps.\n\nAnother thing: y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I start at y=0, need to end at y=9.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, at T=56 it was dangerous, but past, no issue.\n\nSo I think the sequence is all U.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nFor turn t_1=60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nThen at turn 69, y=9.\n\nH=9 turns of actions? From t=60 to t=68, that's 9 actions, H=9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nWith H=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nIn the format, it says \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 + t.\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with actions above, at turn 69, position (0,9).\n\nNow, but I recall that for freeway 7 and 8, danger at T=61, and for freeway 6 at T=62.\n\nSuppose I try to go faster, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or something to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, I am at y=0 at t=60.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay, I remain at y=0, but I need to go to 9, so I must move up eventually.\n\nBut staying would increase H.\n\nSimilarly, moving down not helpful.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nBut is there a constraint I missed?\n\nThe player position: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nBut in all U, I go from 0 to 9, all within bounds.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the car for freeway 1, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be boxed.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because freeways 2-5 have danger at 68,69, which is when I would be at y=8 and 9 if going up, but I am not on those freeways.\n\nPerhaps if I were slower, I might hit, but I am faster.\n\nAnother point: at T=68 and 69, y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous, so if I were on y=5 at T=68, collision, but in my path, at T=68 I am at y=8.\n\nSimilarly, fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if I can reach in 8 turns? Impossible, because from y=0, after 8 U, at t=68, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen I need one more U to go to 9 at t=69.\n\nSo minimum 9 turns.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 actions.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 6 has a car with speed 36, etc., but in this path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6 at T=62, but I am not there.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9, and sequence all U.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 60: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: U }\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be from t=60 to t=68, that's 9 turns.\n\nH=9.\n\nTo be precise, the turns are listed as Turn t_1 + t for t=0 to 8? t from 0 to H-1=8.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0: 60, t=1:61, ..., t=8:68.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the box, it should be written as above.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that at the dangerous times, if I am on other freeways, but in this case, no.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 7 at T=61: span [-47,0], so includes 0.\n\nBut at T=61, I am on y=1, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the optimal sequence of actions consists of moving upward (U) for 9 consecutive turns. This sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 69 without colliding with any cars, as verified by the collision analysis for each freeway at each relevant turn.\n\n### Collision Analysis Summary:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Safe at all turns \\(T \\geq 60\\) (no collision possible).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Dangerous at \\(T = 68, 69\\), but in the path, the player is at \\(y = 2\\) only at \\(T = 62\\), which is safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Identical to freeway 2; dangerous at \\(T = 68, 69\\), but player is at \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 63\\), safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Identical to freeway 2; dangerous at \\(T = 68, 69\\), but player is at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 64\\), safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Identical to freeway 2; dangerous at \\(T = 68, 69\\), but player is at \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 65\\), safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Dangerous at \\(T = 62\\), but player is at \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 66\\), safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Dangerous at \\(T = 61\\), but player is at \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 67\\), safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Identical to freeway 7; dangerous at \\(T = 61\\), but player is at \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 68\\), safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, as it requires exactly 9 upward moves to increase the y-coordinate from 0 to 9. Any deviation (e.g., staying or moving down) would increase \\(H\\) or risk collision, but is unnecessary in this case.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 68\\) is all U (up), resulting in the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 69.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 60: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 63, and I start at y=3. I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. The cars are moving right or left with a given speed. Since all the cars listed are moving right (direction is \"right\"), I only need to worry about right-moving cars. The span for right-moving cars is given as [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] at turn T.\n\nFor example, for freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed s=12. So at turn T, the span is [ -47 + 12*(T-63), -36 + 12*(T-63) ].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on a freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn. That means the car covers the x=0 position at that turn.\n\nAlso, importantly, when I move, I am not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am still on y, and I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So I only check collision for the freeway I am on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThe player update is: at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y between 0 and 9.\n\nThen, at each turn, for the freeway I am on (y_t), I check if 0 is in the car span for that freeway at turn t.\n\nIf I move, I change position at the end of the turn, so during the turn, I am on the starting y.\n\nThe collision condition says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's position at turn T, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's vertical position at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, I am at (0, y_T), and I check if for freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nIf I am moving, say from y to y+1, at turn T I start on y, so I check for freeway y at turn T. Then after moving, at turn T+1, I am on y+1, and I check for freeway y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nAlso, if I stay, I check the same freeway.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9, so I need to move up. Each U action increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays. Since I need to go up, I probably want to use U actions mostly, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\ny=3 to y=9, difference is 6, so minimum turns if no cars would be 6 U actions, but with cars, it might take longer if I have to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut I should check for each freeway from 1 to 8, when the cars are at x=0, so that I need to avoid being on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway k, I need to find when 0 is in the car span for that freeway.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, but looking at the table, for each freeway, there is only one car listed, I think. Let me see.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, freeway 2: one car, etc. Each row has one car per freeway, I believe.\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head, tail, direction, speed) |\n\nIt says \"Cars\", but for each, it's a single tuple, so I think one car per freeway.\n\nFreeway 6 has (60,25,right,36), freeway 7 (96,49,right,48), freeway 8 (96,49,right,48).\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nNow, for a right-moving car, span is [τ, h] at t₁, and at T, [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-t₁)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end? No.\n\nThe span definition: for left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and it moves left.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h] with τ tail, h head? I need to clarify.\n\nLook back:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor left-moving, head at h, tail at τ, so since it's moving left, head is to the right? I think there might be confusion.\n\nAssume that for a car, the head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor left-moving, as time increases, position decreases, so head is at higher x, tail at lower x? Let's see the movement.\n\nFor left-moving: at t₁, span is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)].\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x, so if h and τ are positions, with h > τ for left-moving? [h, τ] with h head, τ tail.\n\nBut in interval notation, [h, τ] might imply h < τ or h > τ? Usually in math, [a,b] with a<b.\n\nBut here, for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the right, so h > τ, so [τ, h] would be better, but it says [h, τ].\n\nPerhaps the notation is [min, max] or something.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nAnd since it's moving left, h - sΔT and τ - sΔT, so if h and τ are such that h > τ, then at T, h - sΔT and τ - sΔT, both decreasing.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h > τ doesn't make sense as an interval; usually we write [left, right].\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, it should be increasing, so τ + sΔT, h + sΔT.\n\nAnd span is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I assume.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: at t₁=63, head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right.\n\nSo τ=-47, h=-36, so left end is τ=-47, right end is h=-36, so the car is from x=-47 to x=-36 at t=63.\n\nSince moving right, at T, it will be from -47 + s(T-63) to -36 + s(T-63).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor collision, 0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor right-moving car at T, min = τ + s(T-t₁), max = h + s(T-t₁)\n\nSo 0 is in [min, max] if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nSo for each freeway, I can find the times when min <= 0 <= max for its car.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at those times, if I am on it, I collide.\n\nI need to be on a freeway only when 0 is not in the car span for that turn.\n\nNow, for freeway k, car span at T: min_k(T) = τ_k + s_k (T - t₁)\n\nmax_k(T) = h_k + s_k (T - t₁)\n\n0 in span if min_k(T) <= 0 <= max_k(T)\n\nWhich is τ_k + s_k (T - 63) <= 0 <= h_k + s_k (T - 63)\n\nSolve for T.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 63\n\nThen τ_k + s_k ΔT <= 0 <= h_k + s_k ΔT\n\nSo from τ_k + s_k ΔT <= 0, s_k ΔT <= -τ_k, so ΔT <= -τ_k / s_k\n\nAnd from 0 <= h_k + s_k ΔT, s_k ΔT >= -h_k, ΔT >= -h_k / s_k\n\nAlso, since min <= max, which should be true as car exists.\n\nSo 0 in span if -h_k / s_k <= ΔT <= -τ_k / s_k\n\nFrom above:\n\nΔT >= -h_k / s_k\n\nAnd ΔT <= -τ_k / s_k\n\nSince s_k > 0.\n\nNow, because for right-moving, τ_k < h_k, so -h_k / s_k < -τ_k / s_k since h_k > τ_k, so -h_k < -τ_k, so -h_k / s_k < -τ_k / s_k.\n\nSo the interval is [ -h_k / s_k , -τ_k / s_k ]\n\nΔT >= -h_k / s_k and ΔT <= -τ_k / s_k\n\nSince h_k > τ_k, -h_k < -τ_k, so -h_k / s_k < -τ_k / s_k, so ΔT from lower to upper: from ceil( -h_k / s_k ) to floor( -τ_k / s_k )? But since ΔT integer, we need to find integer T.\n\nSimilarly, min and max are positions, but the inequality must hold.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the range of ΔT where collision happens.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nΔT >= -h/s = -(-36)/12 = 36/12 = 3\n\nΔT <= -τ/s = -(-47)/12 = 47/12 ≈ 3.9167\n\nSo ΔT >= 3 and ΔT <= 3.9167\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT = 3 or 4? Let's see:\n\nΔT must satisfy both inequalities.\n\nΔT >= ceil( -h/s )? Not necessarily, because -h/s might not integer.\n\nFrom inequality:\n\ns_k ΔT >= -h_k\n\ns_k ΔT <= -τ_k\n\nFor k=1: s=12, h=-36, τ=-47\n\n12 ΔT >= -(-36) = 36? No:\n\n0 <= h + s ΔT, so s ΔT >= -h\n\nSimilarly, τ + s ΔT <= 0, s ΔT <= -τ\n\nSo for k=1:\n\ns ΔT >= -h = -(-36) = 36\n\ns ΔT <= -τ = -(-47) = 47\n\nSo 12 ΔT >= 36 and 12 ΔT <= 47\n\nSo ΔT >= 36/12 = 3\n\nΔT <= 47/12 = 3.916...\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT >= 3 and ΔT <= 3, so ΔT=3?  ΔT <= 3.916, so ΔT=3 since 3<=3.916, and 4>3.916? 47/12=3.916, so ΔT <=3.916, so ΔT=3, because ΔT=4: 12*4=48>47, not <=47.\n\n12 ΔT <=47, so ΔT <= 47/12 ≈3.916, so ΔT=3 (since ΔT integer, 3<=3.916, 4>3.916 not satisfied)\n\nSimilarly, 12 ΔT >=36, ΔT>=3, so for ΔT=3: 12*3=36 >=36, true; and 36 <=47? 12 ΔT <=47, 36<=47 true.\n\nFor ΔT=4: 12*4=48 <=47? 48<=47 false, so not satisfied.\n\nSo only ΔT=3.\n\nΔT = T - 63, so at T=63 +3 =66, collision on freeway 1.\n\nΔT=3, T=66.\n\nNow, let's confirm: at T=66, min = τ + s ΔT = -47 + 12*3 = -47 +36 = -11\n\nmax = h + s ΔT = -36 + 36 =0\n\nSo span [-11,0], so 0 is included, yes collision.\n\nAt T=65, ΔT=2, min= -47 +24= -23, max= -36+24= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=67, ΔT=4, min= -47+48=1, max= -36+48=12, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=66 for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\ns ΔT >= -h = -(-30) =30\n\ns ΔT <= -τ = -(-41) =41\n\nSo 6 ΔT >=30, ΔT >=5\n\n6 ΔT <=41, ΔT <=41/6≈6.833\n\nSo ΔT=5,6\n\nΔT=5: 6*5=30 >=30 true, 30<=41 true\n\nΔT=6: 36>=30 true, 36<=41 true\n\nΔT=7:42<=41 false\n\nSo at T=63+5=68 and T=63+6=69\n\nT=68 and 69.\n\nΔT=5 and 6, T=68,69.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? k=3, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6, same as k=2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nFreeway 5: same, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car? But different freeways, but same parameters, so for each, collision at same times.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 all have (-30,-41,right,6), so for each, collision when ΔT=5 or 6, T=68,69.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, τ=25, h=60, s=36? Head and tail.\n\nτ=25, h=60, s=36\n\nRight-moving, so min at T: τ + s ΔT =25 + 36 ΔT\n\nmax = h + s ΔT =60 + 36 ΔT\n\n0 in span if min <=0<= max\n\nBut min =25 +36 ΔT, since ΔT >=0, min >=25>0, so min >0, so 0 < min <= max, so 0 not <= min, so 0 never in span? min=25 +36ΔT >=25>0, so min >0, so 0 not >= min, so inequality min<=0 false for all ΔT.\n\nSimilarly, max=60+36ΔT>0, but min>0, so 0 not in [min,max].\n\nSo for freeway 6, no collision at any time, since the car is always to the right of x=0? At t₁=63, span [25,60], all x>0, and moving right, so always x>0, never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: k=7, τ=49, h=96, s=48\n\nmin=49 +48ΔT >0, similarly, always min>0, so never at x=0.\n\nFreeway 8: same, τ=49, h=96, s=48, always min>0, never at x=0.\n\nSo only freeways 1,2,3,4,5 have possible collisions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFreeway 1: collision only at T=66\n\nFreeway 2: collisions at T=68 and T=69\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5 at T=68,69.\n\nFreeway 1 has collision only at T=66.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at t=63.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, but I am on y=3 at t=63.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think; freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nBut the player can be at y=0 or y=9, which are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nNow, at each turn, I choose action: U, D, or S.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy: U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 steps up.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when there is a car at x=0.\n\nSpecifically, for freeway y, at certain times.\n\nNow, since I start at t=63, y=3.\n\nFirst, I need to check if at t=63, on y=3, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 3: but at t=63, for freeway 3, car at [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-41,-30] at ΔT=0, so min=-41, max=-30, both negative, 0 not in, so no collision at t=63 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, at t=63, let's see:\n\ny=1: car at [-47,-36], min=-47<0, max=-36<0, 0 not in.\n\ny=2: similar, [-41,-30], min=-41<0, max=-30<0.\n\ny=3: same as y=2? Freeway 3 has same car, [-41,-30], so min=-41<0, max=-30<0.\n\nAll freeways 1-5 at t=63 have negative positions, so no collision at t=63.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions from t=63 onwards.\n\nI want to minimize H, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the collision times.\n\nThe critical points are:\n\n- On freeway 1, collision at T=66\n\n- On freeways 2,3,4,5, collisions at T=68 and T=69\n\nSince freeways 2-5 all have collisions at same times, I can think of them as one group.\n\nBut I need to be on specific y.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at t=63.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up, but let's see the path.\n\nSince y=6 to y=8 have no cars ever, because freeways 6,7,8 no collision at any time.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 are safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6? Freeway k, k is the y-level, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are labeled k=1 to 8, corresponding to y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo y=1,2,3,4,5 have possible collisions, y=6,7,8 are always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are also safe, but y=9 is goal.\n\nNow, I am at y=3, need to go to y=9.\n\ny=6,7,8 are safe, so if I can get to y=6 quickly, then go up to y=9 safely.\n\nBut I have to go through y=4 and y=5, which have collisions at certain times.\n\ny=4 and y=5 are part of the group with collisions at T=68,69.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 also has collisions at T=68,69.\n\ny=1 has collision only at T=66.\n\nNow, let me list the dangerous times per freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=66\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=68,69\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=68,69\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=68,69\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=68,69\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\nNow, I am at t=63, y=3.\n\ny=3 is dangerous only at T=68,69, which are later.\n\nt=63, T=68 is 5 turns later, T=69 is 6 turns later.\n\nI need to move up to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=3 to y=9, need 6 U actions.\n\nBut I might need to stay or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nSince y=6-8 are safe, I should aim to reach y=6 as soon as possible, then go to y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to go through y=4 and y=5, which are dangerous at T=68,69.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 is dangerous at those times, but at t=63, I am safe.\n\nNow, let me consider the actions.\n\nStart: t=63, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to choose actions for t=63, t=64, etc.\n\nSuppose I go up immediately.\n\nAt t=63, action a_{63}: if I do U, then y_{64} = 3 +1 =4\n\nAt turn t=63, I am on y=3, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nAfter action, at t=64, I am on y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nDefine the turn when I am at position.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I check collision for that y_T at that T.\n\nFor example, at T=63, y=3, no collision.\n\nNow, if I do U at t=63, then at T=64, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, at T=64, is y=4 dangerous? y=4 has collisions only at T=68,69, so at T=64, no, since 64 < 68.\n\nSimilarly, I can keep going up.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=4 at T=68 or T=69, for example.\n\nSimilarly for other dangerous y.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are T=66 for y=1, and T=68,69 for y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSince I start from y=3 and go up, I might not be on low y at later times.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nt=63: y=3\n\nIf I always go up:\n\nt=63: U, y=4 at t=64\n\nt=64: U, y=5 at t=65\n\nt=65: U, y=6 at t=66\n\nNow at t=66, y=6.\n\ny=6 is always safe, so no issue.\n\nThen t=66: U, y=7 at t=67\n\nt=67: U, y=8 at t=68\n\nt=68: U, y=9 at t=69\n\nNow, at t=69, y=9, which is the goal, and y=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I was on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt t=63: y=3, safe (not dangerous time)\n\nt=64: y=4, safe (T=64 not 68 or 69)\n\nt=65: y=5, safe (T=65 <68)\n\nt=66: y=6, safe\n\nt=67: y=7, safe\n\nt=68: y=8, safe\n\nt=69: y=9, goal\n\nNow, what about dangerous times: T=66 is dangerous for y=1, but I was on y=6, not y=1.\n\nT=68 and 69 dangerous for y=2-5, but at t=68, I am on y=8, which is safe, and t=69 I am on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collision in this path.\n\nAnd I reached in 6 turns: from t=63 to t=69, that's 6 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at t=63, after action at t=63, position at t=64 is y=4.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 =63, after 0 actions, at turn t_1, y=3.\n\nAfter first action at t_1, at turn t_1+1, y updated.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, after actions.\n\nI need to have y_{t_1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nt=63: start, y=3\n\na_{63}=U, then y_{64}=4\n\na_{64}=U, y_{65}=5\n\na_{65}=U, y_{66}=6\n\na_{66}=U, y_{67}=7\n\na_{67}=U, y_{68}=8\n\na_{68}=U, y_{69}=9\n\nSo at turn t=69, y=9, so H=6 actions? Turns: actions at t=63 to t=68, 6 actions, reach at t=69.\n\nt_1 + H =69, t_1=63, so H=6.\n\nNow, check for collision:\n\nAt each turn, the position and time.\n\nTurn T=63: y=3, freeway 3, at T=63, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nT=64: y=4, freeway 4, at T=64, car on y=4: min and max at T=64.\n\nFor freeway 4, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6, at T, min = τ + s(T-63) = -41 +6(ΔT)\n\nΔT=T-63\n\nAt T=64, ΔT=1, min= -41 +6= -35, max= -30 +6= -24, both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=65: y=5, ΔT=2, min= -41 +12= -29, max= -30 +12= -18? τ=-41, h=-30\n\nmin= τ + s ΔT = -41 +6*2 = -41+12= -29\n\nmax= h + s ΔT = -30 +12= -18\n\n[-29,-18], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=66: y=6, freeway 6, which has no car at x=0 ever, safe.\n\nT=67: y=7, safe.\n\nT=68: y=8, safe.\n\nT=69: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAnd dangerous times: T=66 for y=1, not relevant.\n\nT=68 for y=2-5: at T=68, I am on y=8, not y=2-5.\n\nSimilarly T=69, I am on y=9.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nThus, with 6 actions: all U, I reach in H=6.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 steps, since each U increases by 1, and no way to jump, so H=6 is minimum possible.\n\nIn this case, it works without any issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=1 collision, but I didn't go there.\n\nAlso, for y=3 at T=68,69, but in this path, at T=68, I am on y=8, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 1 at T=66, but I am not on y=1, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I stay or something, but no need.\n\nThe problem is to reach (0,9), and I did in 6 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nIn this case, actions: all U from t=63 to t=68.\n\nBut let's write the turns.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_{63}\n\nIn the sequence, a_{63} = U, then a_{64}=U, etc.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the player position: at t=63, before action, y=3.\n\nAfter a_{63}, y=4 at t=64.\n\nThen a_{64}, y=5 at t=65, and so on.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, I said no collision, but let me double-check.\n\nFreeway 6: car at t=63, τ=25, h=60, s=36, moving right.\n\nAt any T, min =25 +36 ΔT >0, so always min>0, x=0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: τ=49, h=96, s=48, min=49+48ΔT>0.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nAnd freeways 1-5, we have the dangerous times, but in this path, I avoided them.\n\nAt T=66, I am on y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at T=66, for y=1, car is at min=-47+12*3=-47+36=-11, max=-36+36=0, so [ -11, 0], includes 0, so if I were on y=1 at T=66, collision, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=68, for y=2, min= τ + s ΔT = -41 +6*5? ΔT=T-63, T=68, ΔT=5.\n\nFor y=2 car: τ=-41, s=6, min= -41 +6*5= -41+30= -11? ΔT=5, T-63=5.\n\ns ΔT =6*5=30\n\nmin= τ + s ΔT = -41 +30 = -11\n\nmax= h + s ΔT = -30 +30 =0\n\nSo [ -11, 0], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly at T=69, ΔT=6, min= -41 +36= -5, max= -30+36=6, so [ -5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut I am not on those y at those times.\n\nIn my path, at T=68, I am on y=8, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with actions all U.\n\nBut the sequence: actions at t=63 to t=68.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1+5} = U, then at turn t_1+6 =69, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H =69, H=6, so actions from t=63 to t=68, which are t_1 to t_1 +5.\n\nIndices: t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1 for actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nHere H=6, actions at t=63,64,65,66,67,68.\n\nt_1=63, so:\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nThen at turn 69, position (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format: it should list the actions for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut is there any reason to do otherwise? For example, if I go slower, but that would take more turns, which is worse.\n\nOr if I go down, but that increases H, so not minimal.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about freeway 1 collision at T=66, but since I never go to y=1, it's irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some point I have to be on y=3 at T=68, but in this case, I left y=3 early.\n\nAt t=63 I am on y=3, then move to y=4 at t=64, so after t=63, I am not on y=3 again.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=64 only, etc.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6 with all up actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of turns.\n\nStart at t=63, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action (U at t=63), at t=64, y=4\n\nAfter 2 actions (U at t=64), at t=65, y=5\n\nAfter 3 actions (U at t=65), at t=66, y=6\n\nAfter 4 actions (U at t=66), at t=67, y=7\n\nAfter 5 actions (U at t=67), at t=68, y=8\n\nAfter 6 actions (U at t=68), at t=69, y=9\n\nYes.\n\nH=6.\n\nSequence of actions: a_{63} to a_{68}, all U.\n\nIn the answer, it should be written as per format.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt starting from 0.\n\nSo a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere t_1=63, H=6, so t from 0 to 5.\n\na_{63+0} = a_{63} = U\n\na_{63+1} = a_{64} = U\n\n...\n\na_{63+5} = a_{68} = U\n\nSo in the box:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1 +5} = U\n\nThen at turn t_1 +6, position (0,9).\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it shows the sequence, not explicitly H, but it's clear.\n\nPerhaps I should state H, but in the format, it's the sequence.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway 3,4,5 all have cars, but in my path, I was on y=3 at t=63, safe; y=4 at t=64, safe; y=5 at t=65, safe.\n\nt=65: y=5, freeway 5, car: at T=65, ΔT=2, min= -41 +6*2= -41+12= -29, max= -30+12= -18, [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nt=64: y=4, ΔT=1, min= -41+6= -35, max= -30+6= -24, [-35,-24], no.\n\nt=63: similar.\n\nAnd at dangerous times T=68,69, I am not on these y.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTo be thorough, suppose I stay at y=3 for one turn.\n\nAt t=63, if I do S, then at t=64, still y=3.\n\nThen I need to go up from there, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, a_{63}=S, then y_{64}=3\n\nThen a_{64}=U, y_{65}=4\n\na_{65}=U, y_{66}=5\n\na_{66}=U, y_{67}=6\n\na_{67}=U, y_{68}=7\n\na_{68}=U, y_{69}=8\n\na_{69}=U, y_{70}=9\n\nSo at t=70, y=9, H=7 actions, worse than 6.\n\nIf I go down, even worse.\n\nSo minimal is 6 with all up.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 63\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Collision occurs only at turn \\(T = 66\\) (since \\(\\Delta T = T - 63 = 3\\), and the car span is \\([-11, 0]\\)).\n- **Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 (y=2,3,4,5)**: Collisions occur at turns \\(T = 68\\) and \\(T = 69\\) (since \\(\\Delta T = 5\\) and \\(\\Delta T = 6\\), with spans \\([-11, 0]\\) and \\([-5, 6]\\) respectively).\n- **Freeways 6, 7, and 8 (y=6,7,8)**: No collision at any turn, as the car spans are always positive and never include \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(t = 63\\), which is safe (no collision at \\(T = 63\\) for any freeway). To minimize \\(H\\), the player should move directly upward without delay, as any stay or downward action increases \\(H\\).\n\n### Optimal Path\n- From \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\), the minimum number of moves is 6 upward actions (U), as each U increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- The sequence of positions and turns:\n  - Turn 63: Position \\(y = 3\\) (safe).\n  - Action U: Move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 64.\n  - Turn 64: Position \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as \\(T = 64\\) is not a collision time for \\(y=4\\)).\n  - Action U: Move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 65.\n  - Turn 65: Position \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as \\(T = 65\\) is not a collision time for \\(y=5\\)).\n  - Action U: Move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 66.\n  - Turn 66: Position \\(y = 6\\) (always safe, as freeway 6 has no collisions).\n  - Action U: Move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 67.\n  - Turn 67: Position \\(y = 7\\) (always safe, as freeway 7 has no collisions).\n  - Action U: Move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 68.\n  - Turn 68: Position \\(y = 8\\) (always safe, as freeway 8 has no collisions).\n  - Action U: Move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 69.\n\nAt turn 69, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), the goal. No collisions occur, as:\n- At \\(T = 66\\) (dangerous for \\(y=1\\)), the player is on \\(y=6\\) (safe).\n- At \\(T = 68\\) and \\(T = 69\\) (dangerous for \\(y=2,3,4,5\\)), the player is on \\(y=8\\) and \\(y=9\\) (both safe).\n\nThus, \\(H = 6\\) turns are sufficient and minimal, as fewer turns would require moving more than one unit per turn, which is impossible.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\\) for \\(t_1 = 63\\) and \\(H = 6\\) is:\n- \\(a_{63} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{64} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{65} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{66} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{67} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{68} = U\\)\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: U \\end{array} }",

I have to move up to y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the table. Let me list out the car details for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12\n\n- Freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 4: same: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 5: same: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, dir=right, speed=36\n\n- Freeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, dir=right, speed=48\n\n- Freeway 8: same as 7: head=-48, tail=-95, dir=right, speed=48\n\nAll cars are moving to the right, so their positions at time T are given by:\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T is [tail + s*(T - t_1), head + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nSince they're moving right, the head and tail both increase by s per turn.\n\nt_1 is 66, so let τ = T - t_1, the number of turns after t_1.\n\nSo for any car, at turn T = t_1 + τ, the span is:\n\nFor freeway k, let's define the span at τ.\n\nBut collision happens only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nThe player position y_{T} determines which freeway they're on. Since freeways are y=1 to 8, and player is at (0, y), so when y_T = k, they're on freeway k.\n\nBut y_T is the position after the action, I think.\n\nLet's read the collision rule.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are only on freeway y_T, and you only check for collision with cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWhen you move, at turn T, you are at y_T, and you take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut during turn T, you are present at y_T, so collision is checked based on y_T and the car span at time T for that freeway.\n\nThen, after moving, at turn T+1, you are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nIn this case, since we start at turn t_1=66, position (0,0), which is not on any freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 is the start, and y=9 is the goal, probably safe.\n\nThe problem says: \"vertical axis y = 0,1,…,9\", and freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe zones with no cars.\n\nBut let's confirm collision: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nSimilarly, when moving, if you are at y_T = k for k=1 to 8, you need to ensure that for the car on freeway k, 0 is not in Span(T).\n\nOtherwise, collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the span, so I can avoid being on that freeway at those times.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span changes over time.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, T=t_1.\n\nFor each freeway, let's compute the span as a function of τ.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12.\n\nAt τ, span = [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] = [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nSince right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ], tail=37, head=48.\n\nSo [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 is in span if 37 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12τ\n\nBut 37 + 12τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 + 12τ.\n\nSince τ ≥0, 48 + 12τ >0 always, so only 37 + 12τ ≤ 0.\n\nSo 12τ ≤ -37, τ ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but τ ≥0, so never true. Thus for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span for τ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, head=48, tail=37, both positive, moving right, so span starts at 37 and increases, so 0 is never covered. Yes.\n\nNow freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=6.\n\nSpan: [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] = [-59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ ⇒ 6τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 8\n\nSecond, -59 + 6τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6τ ≤ 59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSo τ from 8 to 9 inclusive? τ must be integer? Turns are discrete, so τ integer.\n\nτ ≥8 and τ ≤9.833, so τ=8,9\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ for τ≥8, and -59 + 6τ ≤0 for τ≤9.833, so since τ integer, τ=8,9\n\nAt τ=8: span = [-59 + 6*8, -48 + 6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0≤0 is true.\n\nAt τ=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5, 6], -5 ≤0≤6, yes.\n\nAt τ=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 1≤0? 0 not ≥1, so 0 not ≤12 but 0 <1, so not in [1,12], no.\n\nSimilarly τ=7: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], -17≤0≤-6? 0≤-6 false, no.\n\nSo for freeway 2, 0 in span at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as 2, head=-48, tail=-59, speed=6, so same, 0 in span at τ=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, τ=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5: same, τ=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, dir=right, speed=36.\n\nSpan: [-83 + 36τ, -48 + 36τ]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ ⇒ 36τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ ≥ 2 since integer? τ min integer such that τ ≥ 1.333, so τ≥2.\n\nSecond, -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36τ ≤ 83 ⇒ τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ ≤ 2 since integer.\n\nτ ≤ 2.305 and τ ≥ 1.333, so τ=2.\n\nCheck:\n\nτ=2: span = [-83 + 36*2, -48 + 36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24]\n\n-11 ≤ 0 ≤ 24, yes.\n\nτ=1: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12], 0 not between -47 and -12.\n\nτ=3: [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only τ=2 for freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, dir=right, speed=48.\n\nSpan: [-95 + 48τ, -48 + 48τ]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ ⇒ 48τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 1\n\nSecond, -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 48τ ≤ 95 ⇒ τ ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so τ ≤ 1 since integer? τ ≤ 1.979, so τ=1\n\nτ=1: span = [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0]\n\n-47 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nτ=2: [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nτ=0: [-95, -48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only τ=1 for freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48, so only τ=1.\n\nNow summarize when each freeway has 0 in span:\n\n- Freeway 1: never\n\n- Freeway 2: τ=8,9\n\n- Freeway 3: τ=8,9\n\n- Freeway 4: τ=8,9\n\n- Freeway 5: τ=8,9\n\n- Freeway 6: τ=2\n\n- Freeway 7: τ=1\n\n- Freeway 8: τ=1\n\nτ is relative to t_1=66, so T = t_1 + τ.\n\nBut we care about when the player is on that freeway.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up), D (down), S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, 0, with y clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, we must move up at least 9 times. Each U increases y by 1, S or D would not help or set us back, so minimal turns should involve moving up as much as possible, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a freeway when it has a car at 0.\n\nBut moving down from y=0 might not be possible? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y=0, D would try to go to -1, but probably clamped to 0? The equation says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, I assume. Similarly for y=9 and U.\n\nBut in this case, since we start at y=0, and need to go up, D might not be useful, except perhaps to stay on y=0 longer, but y=0 has no cars, so safe. Similarly, S keeps us at same y.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we probably want to move up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collisions only on freeways y=1 to 8 when 0 in span at that turn.\n\nWe need to be on y=9 at some turn, which is safe.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: never dangerous, since no car at 0 ever.\n\n- y=2: dangerous at τ=8,9\n\n- y=3: dangerous at τ=8,9\n\n- y=4: dangerous at τ=8,9\n\n- y=5: dangerous at τ=8,9\n\n- y=6: dangerous only at τ=2\n\n- y=7: dangerous only at τ=1\n\n- y=8: dangerous only at τ=1\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\ny=6 dangerous only at τ=2\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=1\n\ny=8 dangerous at τ=1\n\ny=2 to y=5 dangerous at τ=8 and 9.\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move, we can increase y by 0 or 1 (since D from 0 stays at 0, but not helpful for progress).\n\nTo increase y, we must use U.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, all U, but we might hit a collision if we are on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\nSo we need to ensure that when we are on a freeway k at turn τ, it is not dangerous for that k at that τ.\n\nτ is the turn index from start.\n\nLet t be the turn number, but since we start at t_1, τ = t - t_1.\n\nSet τ=0 at start.\n\nPlayer position y_τ at time τ.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions for τ=0 to H-1, such that at the end, after H actions, y_H =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nTurn T: after action a_T, position is y_{T+1}? I need to clarify the timing.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, position is (0, y_T).\n\nThen player chooses action a_T, which determines Δy_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T, the player is at y_T during the turn, so collision check based on y_T and cars at time T.\n\nThen after action, at next turn T+1, position is y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is set.\n\nWe need to reach y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, leading to position after H steps.\n\nAt turn T, for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have position y_T, and we take action a_T.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when we are at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, we must not have 0 in span for freeway y_T at time T.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no issue.\n\nIn this case, we start at y_{t_1} =0, which is safe.\n\nThen after action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nBut at turn T, position y_T is before action, I think.\n\nLet's read the player update:\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position is y_t, then action a_t, then y_{t+1} set.\n\nAt turn t, during the turn, position is y_t, so collision check based on y_t.\n\nThen after action, at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =0.\n\nWe take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after last action, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and we reach position after H steps.\n\nFor collision, we need that for each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then for freeway k=y_T, 0 not in Span(T).\n\nSince at turn T, position y_T.\n\nNow, y_T for T = t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9, which is safe, and no action taken, so no collision check needed for that turn, I assume.\n\nThe collision is checked during the turns when actions are taken, from T = t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, take action, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe last turn with action is t_1 + H -1, at which we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, take action to go to y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, we are at y_{t_1 + H}=9, but no action, so no collision check? The problem says \"collision occurs at turn T\", and turn T is when we are present.\n\nBut for the sequence, actions are taken from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and position at t_1 + H is the final.\n\nI think collision is only checked for turns where we are moving or present during the action turns.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we are at y_T, and if y_T in 1-8, we check cars at T.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, safe, and no action, so no issue.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nStart at τ=0 (T=t_1), y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to end at some y_H =9 for H to be minimized.\n\nSince we need to increase y by 9, and each U increases by 1, we need at least 9 U actions. S or D keep y the same or decrease, but decreasing might not help, so minimal H is at least 9, with all U, but we might need to insert S or D to avoid dangerous positions.\n\nH is the number of turns, from action at τ=0 to τ=H-1, reaching y_H=9 at τ=H.\n\nτ from 0 to H, position y_τ.\n\nAt time τ, T = t_1 + τ.\n\nNow, y_τ is position at turn T, so for collision at τ, we care about y_τ and the time τ (since T=t_1+τ).\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous (y, τ) pairs:\n\n- For y=2,3,4,5: dangerous at τ=8,9\n\n- For y=6: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- For y=7: dangerous at τ=1\n\n- For y=8: dangerous at τ=1\n\n- y=1 always safe.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 by some τ=H.\n\nThe path: we move step by step, y_τ to y_{τ+1} by action.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,1 each step, and y from 0 to 9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being at a dangerous (y,τ).\n\nFirst, note that at τ=1, y=7 and y=8 are dangerous.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=0.\n\nIf we take action at τ=0: a_0, to go to y_1.\n\ny_1 could be 0 (S or D) or 1 (U).\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, position y_1, then action to y_2, etc.\n\nThe dangerous points:\n\nSpecifically, at τ=1, if we are on y=7 or y=8, collision.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=0, so after one action, at τ=1, we can be at y=0 or y=1, not higher. Since from y=0, U to y=1, S or D to y=0.\n\nSo at τ=1, possible y_1 =0 or 1.\n\ny=7 and 8 are not reachable at τ=1, since from y=0 in one step, max y=1.\n\nSo for τ=1, we cannot be on y=7 or 8 anyway, so no problem at τ=1 for those.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6 dangerous at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, position y_2.\n\ny_2 could be from 0 to 2, since from y=0 at τ=0, after two actions, max y=2 (two U).\n\nMin y=0.\n\nSo at τ=2, y_2 between 0 and 2.\n\nBut y=6 is dangerous at τ=2, but y=6 cannot be reached at τ=2, since max y=2 <6.\n\nSo no issue, we cannot be on y=6 at τ=2 anyway.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=8 and 9, y=2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nAt τ=8, position y_8.\n\nFrom start, after 8 actions, y_8 can be from 0 to 8.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y_9 from 0 to 9.\n\nNow, if we go all U, we reach y_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=8, if we are on y=8, and if y=8 is dangerous at τ=8? y=8 dangerous at τ=1, but τ=1 is early, not at τ=8.\n\nLet's list when each y is dangerous.\n\nFor y=2,3,4,5: dangerous only at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nFor y=6: dangerous only at τ=2, but at τ=2, we can only be up to y=2, not y=6, so no conflict.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 dangerous only at τ=1, at τ=1, we can only be y=0 or 1, not 7.\n\ny=8 dangerous only at τ=1, similarly not reachable.\n\ny=1 never dangerous.\n\nSo actually, the only dangerous times are for y=2,3,4,5 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nIn the all-up path: start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (U), at τ=1, y=1 (safe).\n\nAfter second action (U), at τ=2, y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is not dangerous at τ=2, only at τ=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, continue: after third U, τ=3, y=3 safe.\n\n...\n\nUp to after eighth U, at τ=8, y=8? Let's see:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, at τ=1: y=1\n\nAfter a_1=U, at τ=2: y=2\n\nAfter a_2=U, at τ=3: y=3\n\nAfter a_3=U, at τ=4: y=4\n\nAfter a_4=U, at τ=5: y=5\n\nAfter a_5=U, at τ=6: y=6\n\nAfter a_6=U, at τ=7: y=7\n\nAfter a_7=U, at τ=8: y=8\n\nNow, at τ=8, y=8. Is y=8 dangerous? y=8 is dangerous only at τ=1, not at τ=8. At τ=8, for y=8, is it dangerous?\n\nFrom above, y=8 dangerous only at τ=1. For other τ, it should be safe, since no car at 0 except at τ=1 for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, after a_8=U, at τ=9: y=9, which is goal.\n\nBut at τ=9, we are at y=9, but collision is checked during the turn when we take action, up to τ=8.\n\nAt turn τ=8, we are at y=8, and take action.\n\ny=8 at τ=8: is it dangerous? For freeway 8, dangerous only at τ=1, not at τ=8, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, we reach y=9, no action, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at τ=H, so after 9 actions, y_9=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from τ=0 to 8, 9 actions, y from 0 to 9.\n\nPositions during turns: at τ=0, y=0 safe\n\nτ=1, y=1 safe\n\nτ=2, y=2 safe (since dangerous only at τ=8,9)\n\n...\n\nτ=5, y=5 safe\n\nτ=6, y=6: at τ=6, is y=6 dangerous? y=6 dangerous only at τ=2, not at τ=6, so safe.\n\nτ=7, y=7: dangerous only at τ=1, not τ=7, safe.\n\nτ=8, y=8: dangerous only at τ=1, not τ=8, safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at τ=8 and τ=9, y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous, but in this path, at τ=8, we are at y=8, not y=2-5.\n\nAt τ=9, we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nIn the all-up path, we never are on y=2,3,4,5 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nAt τ=8, we are on y=8, which is safe at that time.\n\nAt τ=9, we are on y=9, not checked or safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nMoreover, we reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous points.\n\nFor example, at τ=8, if we were on y=5, it would be dangerous, but in this path, at τ=8, we are on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, if on y=5, dangerous, but we are on y=9.\n\nSo all-up sequence should work with no collision.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nStart at t_1=66, position (0,0)\n\nAction sequence: all U for 9 actions.\n\nThen at turn t_1+9, position (0,9)\n\nBut let's write the actions for each turn.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, position y=1, then a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1+8: a_{t_1+8} = U, then position at turn t_1+9 is y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to t_1+8, that's 9 actions, H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1+8: a_{t_1+8}\n\nWith all U.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nEarlier I thought y=2,3,4,5 dangerous at τ=8,9, but in this path, we are not on them at those times.\n\nFor example, at τ=8, we are on y=8, which is fine.\n\nAt τ=9, we are on y=9.\n\nThe only potential problem is if we stay on lower y, but in this case, we are moving up.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=6 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, if we were on y=6, dangerous, but in all-up, at τ=2, we are on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since 9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be forced to avoid.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nAll freeways except y=1 have dangerous times, but we avoid by not being there at those times.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=1 at τ=1, safe.\n\ny=2 at τ=2, safe since dangerous only at τ=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at τ=3, safe.\n\ny=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\ny=5 at τ=5, safe.\n\ny=6 at τ=6, and at τ=6, y=6 is not dangerous, only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at τ=7, not dangerous.\n\ny=8 at τ=8, not dangerous.\n\nThen y=9 at τ=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I misread the dangerous times.\n\nFor y=2, dangerous at τ=8,9.\n\nIn the path, at τ=8, we are on y=8, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y=9.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway 1? But freeway 1 is never dangerous, so no problem.\n\nIn the state, freeway 1 has car, but since it never covers 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo minimal H=9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0), and after first U, to (0,1), which is freeway 1, but at τ=1, T=t_1+1, freeway 1 car span: at τ=1, [37+12*1, 48+12*1] = [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think it's possible in 9 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 74: U\n\nt_1=66, actions from t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nTurn t_1: 66, a_{66}\n\nTurn t_1+1: 67, a_{67}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1+8: 66+8=74, a_{74}\n\nThen position at turn 75 is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 74, to go to y=9 at turn 75.\n\nNumber of turns with action: 9 turns.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nTurn t_1 =66: position y=0, take action a_{66}, go to y_{67}\n\nAt turn 66, position y_{66}=0, safe.\n\nTake a_{66}=U, so y_{67}=1\n\nThen turn 67: position y_{67}=1, take a_{67}=U, y_{68}=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 73: position y_{73}=7 (since from start, after 7 U, y=7 at turn 73? Let's index.\n\nAt turn 66: y=0\n\nAfter a_{66}: y_{67}=1\n\nTurn 67: y=1, after a_{67}=U, y_{68}=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 73: y_{73} = ? Start turn 66: y=0\n\nAfter 0 actions, y_{66}=0\n\nAfter 1 action, y_{67}=1\n\nAfter 2 actions, y_{68}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{66+k} = k\n\nBecause each U increases y by 1.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{66+H} = H, since start from 0.\n\ny_{66} =0\n\ny_{67} = y_{66} + Δy_{66} = 0 +1 =1 if U\n\ny_{68} = y_{67} + Δy_{67} =1 +1=2 if U\n\nSo after m actions, y_{66+m} = m\n\nSet equal to 9, so m=9, y_{66+9} = y_{75} =9\n\nActions from t=66 to t=74, that's t=66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74: 9 actions.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor T=66: y=0, safe\n\nT=67: y=1, safe\n\nT=68: y=2, now at τ= T - t_1 = 68-66=2, y=2, which is not dangerous at τ=2, since dangerous only for y=2 at τ=8,9.\n\nτ=2, T=68, τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, T=69: y=3, τ=3, safe\n\nT=70: y=4, τ=4, safe\n\nT=71: y=5, τ=5, safe\n\nT=72: y=6, τ=6, y=6 dangerous only at τ=2, not τ=6, safe\n\nT=73: y=7, τ=7, y=7 dangerous at τ=1, not τ=7, safe\n\nT=74: y=8, τ=8, y=8 dangerous at τ=1, not τ=8, safe\n\nThen at T=75, y=9, no action.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo no need for any detour.\n\nThus minimal H=9, all U actions.\n\nBut the car states might have been set to make it necessary to wait or something, but in this case, it seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car directions or something.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 6, at τ=2, dangerous, but at τ=2, we are on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps the player must not be on the freeway when car is at 0, but since we avoid those times, it should be ok.\n\nSo I think the answer is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\n}\n\nThis should work.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and H=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? No, because to go from 0 to 9, need at least 9 up moves, and since we can only move up 1 at a time, H must be at least 9.\n\nWith down or stay, it would take more turns, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nThus, this should be the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2,3,4,5, at τ=8 and 9, dangerous, but we are not on them at those times.\n\nFor example, if we were slower, we might be on y=4 at τ=8, but in this case, we are faster.\n\nSo all good.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 66\\) is 9, with all actions being \"U\" (up). This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), as verified below.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y = k\\) (where \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at turn \\(T\\) and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at time \\(T\\).\n- The dangerous \\((y, \\tau)\\) pairs (where \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\)) are:\n  - \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) at \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\)\n  - \\(y = 6\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\)\n  - \\(y = 7\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\)\n  - \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\)\n- \\(y = 1\\) is always safe, and \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are safe zones with no cars.\n\n#### Path with All \"U\" Actions:\n- Start at turn \\(T = 66\\) (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- After each \"U\" action, the player moves up one unit per turn.\n- Positions and collision checks:\n  - \\(\\tau = 0\\) (\\(T = 66\\)): \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n  - \\(\\tau = 1\\) (\\(T = 67\\)): \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, always safe).\n  - \\(\\tau = 2\\) (\\(T = 68\\)): \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2; dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\), so safe at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n  - \\(\\tau = 3\\) (\\(T = 69\\)): \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3; dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\), so safe at \\(\\tau = 3\\)).\n  - \\(\\tau = 4\\) (\\(T = 70\\)): \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4; dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\), so safe at \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n  - \\(\\tau = 5\\) (\\(T = 71\\)): \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5; dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\), so safe at \\(\\tau = 5\\)).\n  - \\(\\tau = 6\\) (\\(T = 72\\)): \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6; dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 2\\), so safe at \\(\\tau = 6\\)).\n  - \\(\\tau = 7\\) (\\(T = 73\\)): \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7; dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 1\\), so safe at \\(\\tau = 7\\)).\n  - \\(\\tau = 8\\) (\\(T = 74\\)): \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8; dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 1\\), so safe at \\(\\tau = 8\\)).\n- After the action at \\(T = 74\\) (\\(\\tau = 8\\)), \\(y_{75} = 9\\) is reached at turn \\(T = 75\\) (\\(\\tau = 9\\)), which is safe and the goal.\n\nNo collisions occur, as the player is never on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous \\(\\tau\\). Since moving down or staying would increase \\(H\\) beyond 9, \\(H = 9\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 66\\) to \\(t_1 + 8 = 74\\) is all \"U\".\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0, 3) at turn 69 to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving on each freeway, and collision happens only if at the turn I'm on a freeway, and for that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not considered on it until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, so I probably want to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nLet me list out the car states at turn t=69 for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=12. Since it's right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] = [-47 + 12(T-69), -36 + 12(T-69)]\n\n- Freeway 2: h=-30, τ=-41, right, s=6 → span: [-41 + 6(T-69), -30 + 6(T-69)]\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2? It says (-30, -41, right, 6) for both 2 and 3? Let me check.\n\nThe table says:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (-36, -47, right, 12) |\n\n| 2 | (-30, -41, right, 6) |\n\n| 3 | (-30, -41, right, 6) |  -- same as 2?\n\n| 4 | (-30, -41, right, 6) |  -- again same\n\n| 5 | (-30, -41, right, 6) |  -- and same\n\n| 6 | (60, 25, right, 36) |  -- head 60, tail 25? But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the direction.\n\nFor right-moving: it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6: (60, 25, right, 36). But 60 > 25, so head is 60, tail is 25? But for right-moving, if it's moving right, the head should be the front, so if head is larger, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the description: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, so for freeway 6: τ=25, h=60, both positive.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7 and 8: (96,49,right,48), so τ=49, h=96.\n\nAnd for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h < τ, but here all are right-moving, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-36,-47,right,12), but -36 > -47, so head -36, tail -47, so for right-moving, since it's moving right, τ should be the smaller one, so τ=-47, h=-36.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for freeways 2,3,4,5: all have (-30,-41,right,6), so τ=-41, h=-30.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is within the car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for freeway k at turn T, if min_span <= 0 <= max_span for that car.\n\nSince the car spans are intervals, and we need 0 inside [min, max].\n\nNow, the player is at y=3 at turn 69.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 6, so minimum turns would be 6 if I can move up every turn without collision, but I have to check if that's possible considering the cars.\n\nSince moving up takes me to higher y, and cars are on y=1 to 8, I need to be careful when I'm on those freeways.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a certain y, I need that for that y and that turn, 0 is not in the car span for that freeway.\n\nIf I move to a new y, I am not on that new y until the next turn, so for collision, it's only based on the current y at the current turn.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and for each future turn, when 0 is in the car span.\n\nFirst, define ΔT = T - 69, so for turn T, ΔT is the number of turns after 69.\n\nSo for freeway k, at turn T = 69 + ΔT, the car span:\n\n- Freeway 1: right-moving, τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\n  Span: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-47 + 12 ΔT, -36 + 12 ΔT]\n\n  0 is in span if -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT\n\n  Since -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT\n\n  But -36 + 12 ΔT is larger, so we need:\n\n  -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT\n\n  First inequality: -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 ⇒ 12 ΔT <= 47 ⇒ ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <= 3 since integer\n\n  Second inequality: 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT ⇒ 36 <= 12 ΔT ⇒ ΔT >= 36/12 = 3\n\n  So for ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3? ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3, so only at ΔT=3\n\n  Check: at ΔT=3: -47 + 12*3 = -47 + 36 = -11 <= 0? -11 <=0 true, and 0 <= -36 + 36 =0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\n  At ΔT=2: -47+24= -23 <=0 true, but 0 <= -36+24= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not.\n\n  At ΔT=4: -47+48=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and 0 <= -36+48=12 true but first false.\n\n  So only at ΔT=3, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\n- Freeway 2: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6, right-moving\n\n  Span: [-41 + 6 ΔT, -30 + 6 ΔT]\n\n  0 in span if -41 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= -30 + 6 ΔT\n\n  First: -41 + 6 ΔT <= 0 ⇒ 6 ΔT <= 41 ⇒ ΔT <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so ΔT <=6\n\n  Second: 0 <= -30 + 6 ΔT ⇒ 30 <= 6 ΔT ⇒ ΔT >= 5\n\n  So for ΔT >=5 and ΔT <=6\n\n  At ΔT=5: -41+30= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -30+30=0 true\n\n  ΔT=6: -41+36= -5 <=0 true, 0 <= -30+36=6 true\n\n  ΔT=4: -41+24= -17 <=0 true, but 0 <= -30+24= -6? 0<=-6 false\n\n  ΔT=7: -41+42=1 <=0 false\n\n  So freeway 2 has car at 0 when ΔT=5 or 6.\n\n- Freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same parameters: (-30,-41,right,6), so also at ΔT=5 and 6.\n\nThe car state is listed separately for each freeway, but they have the same values, so for each, the car is present at the same times.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5: all have the same: (-30,-41,right,6), so freeways 2,3,4,5 all have cars at 0 when ΔT=5 and 6.\n\nNow freeway 6: (60,25,right,36) — head 60, tail 25? τ=25, h=60, s=36\n\nSpan: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [25 + 36 ΔT, 60 + 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 25 + 36 ΔT <= 0 <= 60 + 36 ΔT? But 25 + 36 ΔT is always positive for ΔT >=0, since min at ΔT=0 is 25>0, so 0 is never <= 25 + 36 ΔT, so 0 never in span. So no collision possible on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (96,49,right,48) — τ=49, h=96, s=48\n\nSpan: [49 + 48 ΔT, 96 + 48 ΔT] always positive, so 0 never in span. No collision.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (96,49,right,48), same, no collision.\n\nSo only freeways 1 to 5 have possible collisions, but freeway 1 only at ΔT=3, and freeways 2-5 at ΔT=5 and 6.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at ΔT=3, which is turn T=69+3=72\n\n- Freeways 2,3,4,5: collision at ΔT=5 and 6, turns 74 and 75.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn 69 (ΔT=0).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I need to go up, and collisions are only on certain turns, I should avoid being on the affected freeways at those turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 72 (ΔT=3), freeway 1 has a car at 0, so if I am on y=1 at turn 72, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 74 and 75, if I am on y=2,3,4, or 5, I collide because freeways 2-5 all have cars at 0 then.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 correspond to y=2,3,4,5? Freeway k is for y=k, I assume.\n\nIn the problem, freeways are for y=1 to 8, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn 72 (T=72), if I am on y=1, I collide because freeway 1 has car at 0.\n\n- At turn 74 (T=74), if I am on y=2,3,4, or 5, I collide because for each of freeways 2,3,4,5, 0 is in span.\n\nSimilarly at turn 75 (T=75), same for y=2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, at other times, no collisions, so I can be on any freeway without issue, except at these points.\n\nAlso, since freeways 6,7,8 have no collisions, y=6,7,8 are always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and I need to be at (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at turn 69.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I need to increase y by 6, min H=6 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if I can do that without collision.\n\nAt turn 69: I am at y=3. Now, for this turn, do I have collision? At turn 69, ΔT=0.\n\nFor freeway 3 (y=3): at ΔT=0, span is [-41 + 0, -30 +0] for freeway 3? Freeway 3 has (-30,-41,right,6), so at ΔT=0, span [-41, -30], which is negative, 0 not in [-41,-30], since -41 to -30, both negative, 0 not included. Similarly for others at ΔT=0, all spans are negative or positive, but for y=3 at turn 69, span is [-41,-30], 0 not in, so no collision now.\n\nNow, if I go up every turn:\n\nTurn 69: start y=3, no collision.\n\nAction: say U, then y=4 at turn 70.\n\nTurn 70: y=4, ΔT=1 for cars.\n\nFor freeway 4: at ΔT=1, span [-41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35, -24], both negative, 0 not in, no collision.\n\nAction U, y=5 at turn 71.\n\nTurn 71: y=5, ΔT=2, span for freeway 5: [-41+12? s=6, ΔT=2, -41+12= -29? -41 + 6*2 = -41+12= -29, h=-30+12= -18? span [-29,-18], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, y=6 at turn 72.\n\nNow turn 72: y=6, ΔT=3.\n\nFreeway 6 has no car at 0 ever, as we saw, so safe.\n\nBut at this turn, freeway 1 has car at 0, but I am on y=6, not y=1, so no issue.\n\nAction U, y=7 at turn 73.\n\nTurn 73: y=7, safe, since freeway 7 no issue.\n\nAction U, y=8 at turn 74.\n\nTurn 74: y=8, ΔT=5.\n\nFreeway 8 no issue, safe.\n\nBut at this turn, for freeways 2-5, there is car at 0, but I am on y=8, not affected.\n\nAction U, y=9 at turn 75.\n\nNow turn 75: I reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I am at (0,9), goal reached.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 69: at y=3, action U to y=4\n\nTurn 70: at y=4, action U to y=5\n\nTurn 71: at y=5, action U to y=6\n\nTurn 72: at y=6, action U to y=7\n\nTurn 73: at y=7, action U to y=8\n\nTurn 74: at y=8, action U to y=9\n\nTurn 75: at y=9, done.\n\nI started at turn 69, after H turns, I reach at turn 69 + H - 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position at t+1.\n\nDefine: at turn t, I am at position y_t, I choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn t=69, y_69 = 3.\n\nAfter action a_69, y_70 = y_69 + Δy.\n\nI want y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\n- Turn 69: action U, so y_70 = 4\n\n- Turn 70: action U, y_71 =5\n\n- Turn 71: action U, y_72 =6\n\n- Turn 72: action U, y_73 =7\n\n- Turn 73: action U, y_74 =8\n\n- Turn 74: action U, y_75 =9\n\nSo at turn 75, y=9, which is the goal. So I reached at turn 75, which is t_1 + 6, since t_1=69, 69+6=75.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 69 to turn 74 I take actions, and at turn 75 I have position.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=69 to t=74, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nAnd at turn 75, I am at y=9.\n\nIn terms of the turn index, at turn T, I am at y_T, and I take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nIn this case, T=75, y_75=9.\n\nThe actions were taken from t=69 to t=74.\n\nNow, in this sequence, was there any collision?\n\nAt each turn, when I was on a freeway:\n\n- Turn 69: y=3, on freeway 3. At ΔT=0, no car at 0, safe.\n\n- Turn 70: y=4, on freeway 4, ΔT=1, span [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\n- Turn 71: y=5, on freeway 5, ΔT=2, span [-29,-18], no 0, safe.\n\n- Turn 72: y=6, on freeway 6, no car ever at 0, safe.\n\n- Turn 73: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\n- Turn 74: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nAnd at turn 75, y=9, not freeway, no car.\n\nMoreover, at the critical turns:\n\nTurn 72: freeway 1 has car at 0, but I was on y=6, not y=1.\n\nTurn 74: freeways 2-5 have cars at 0, but I was on y=8, not affected.\n\nTurn 75: similarly, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nTherefore, I can reach in 6 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? Since I need to increase y by 6, I cannot do it in fewer than 6 turns, because each U only increases by 1, and S or D would not help to go up faster. So 6 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car at turn 72 for freeway 1.\n\nAt turn 72, ΔT=3, freeway 1: span [-47 + 12*3, -36 + 12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included, so yes, if on y=1, collide.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 74, ΔT=5, freeway 2: span [-41 +6*5, -30 +30] = [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt turn 75, ΔT=6, freeway 2: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nBut in my path, I was not on these at those times.\n\nAlso, for freeway 3,4,5 same.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I passed through y=3,4,5 at turns 69,70,71, which are before the critical turns, so no issue.\n\nAt turn 71, y=5, which is freeway 5, and at ΔT=2, which is fine.\n\nΔT=2 for turn 71? Turn 71 is T=71, t1=69, ΔT=2.\n\nSpan for freeway 5 at ΔT=2: [-41 + 12? s=6, so -41 + 6*2 = -41+12=-29, h=-30+12=-18? tail τ=-41, so min = τ + s ΔT = -41 + 6*2 = -41+12=-29, max = h + s ΔT = -30 + 12 = -18, so [-29,-18], 0 not in, yes.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=6, with actions U,U,U,U,U,U from t=69 to t=74.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from t=69 to t=69+H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so after H actions, I reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nDefine: let t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nStart at t=t1=69, y=3.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} should be 9.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAfter 0 actions: at t=69, y=3\n\nAfter 1 action: a_69, y_70=4\n\nAfter 2: a_70, y_71=5\n\nAfter 3: a_71, y_72=6\n\nAfter 4: a_72, y_73=7\n\nAfter 5: a_73, y_74=8\n\nAfter 6 actions: a_74, y_75=9\n\nSo at turn t1 + H = 69 + 6 = 75, y=9.\n\nH=6 actions: from t=69 to t=74.\n\nThe sequence is a_{69} to a_{74}, all U.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5} = U\n\nSince t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 5 = 74.\n\nThe answer format says: \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{69}\n\nt=1: a_{70}\n\n...\n\nt=5: a_{74}\n\nAll U.\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut is there any reason I need to use S or D? In this case, no, since I can go straight up.\n\nBut let me see if at some point I might be forced to stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't, since only +1 per turn.\n\nUnless there is a way to jump, but no.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, freeways 2,3,4,5 all have the same car parameters, but they are different freeways, so at turns 74 and 75, all of y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous.\n\nBut since I was not on them at those times, fine.\n\nPerhaps I could go slower to avoid, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 72, y=1 is dangerous, but I was not on it.\n\nIn fact, in my path, I never went to y=1 or below, started from y=3.\n\ny=0 is safe, but going down would take more turns, not efficient.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position: at turn 69, I am at (0,3), which is on freeway 3, but as we saw, no collision.\n\nAnd I start by moving up.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the task is to output the sequence for the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\n}\n\nSince t_1=69.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 69: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on, with t_1 given.\n\nSince t_1=69, it should be fine.\n\nBut in the box, I think I need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should include H, but the answer is the sequence.\n\nThe box should contain the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's clear.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any issue at turn 74?\n\nAt turn 74, I am at y=8, which is freeway 8, no car issue.\n\nAnd I move to y=9.\n\nAt turn 75, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nSuppose I try to go faster, but I can't.\n\nOr if I stay at some point, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at turn 69, y=3, then later go up, but I would arrive later, H larger.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo min is 6.\n\nBut just for curiosity, suppose I was on y=1 at some point, but in this case not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 75, when I reach y=9, but turn 75 is also a critical turn for y=2,3,4,5, but since I am not on them, fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, no cars at 0, so safe.\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36), at ΔT=0, [25,60], both >0, and increasing, so min is 25>0, so 0 never in, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think H=6 with all U is the way.\n\nSo the sequence is six U actions from turn 69 to 74.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 69\\) is 6, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 69**: Player at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 has car span \\([-41, -30]\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\), which does not contain 0. Action U moves to \\(y = 4\\).\n- **Turn 70**: Player at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 has car span \\([-35, -24]\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 1\\), which does not contain 0. Action U moves to \\(y = 5\\).\n- **Turn 71**: Player at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 has car span \\([-29, -18]\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 2\\), which does not contain 0. Action U moves to \\(y = 6\\).\n- **Turn 72**: Player at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 has no car at 0 at any turn (span always positive). Action U moves to \\(y = 7\\).\n- **Turn 73**: Player at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 has no car at 0 at any turn (span always positive). Action U moves to \\(y = 8\\).\n- **Turn 74**: Player at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 has no car at 0 at any turn (span always positive). Action U moves to \\(y = 9\\).\n- **Turn 75**: Player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision occurs.\n\nCritical turns with collisions are:\n- Turn 72 (\\(\\Delta T = 3\\)): Freeway 1 has car span \\([-11, 0]\\), containing 0. Player is at \\(y = 6\\), not affected.\n- Turn 74 (\\(\\Delta T = 5\\)): Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5 have car spans containing 0 (e.g., freeway 2 span \\([-11, 0]\\)). Player is at \\(y = 8\\), not affected.\n- Turn 75 (\\(\\Delta T = 6\\)): Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5 have car spans containing 0 (e.g., freeway 2 span \\([-5, 6]\\)). Player is at \\(y = 9\\), not affected.\n\nSince the player must increase \\(y\\) by 6 and each U action increases \\(y\\) by 1, \\(H = 6\\) is minimal. No S or D actions are needed, as they would increase \\(H\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 69: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 72 and the player starts at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The y-coordinate must stay within [0,9].\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (meaning y_T = k) and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player), then collision occurs.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} (by U or D), at turn T the player is still on row y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1}. So we only check the car on the current row at the current turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (which is 72). For each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have a car described by (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nNote: The representation for left-moving and right-moving:\n- For a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost (larger x) and tail is the leftmost (smaller x). So at time t1, the car spans [tail, head] (since tail <= head).\n  Then at time T (>= t1), the span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the leftmost (smaller x) and tail is the rightmost (larger x). So at time t1, the car spans [head, tail] (which is [smaller, larger]? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire span shifts left.\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let's check:\n\nThe cars for freeways 1 to 8 are:\nk=1: (48,37,right,12) -> since right, head=48, tail=37 -> so at t1, the car is at [37,48] and moving right at 12 per turn.\nk=2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> head=-48, tail=-59 -> but for a right-moving car, we expect tail <= head? Here, -59 < -48, so actually the tail is -59 and head is -48, so the span is [-59, -48]? But the problem says for right: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at t1, the car is at [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly for k=3,4,5: same as k=2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> so span at t1: [-59, -48] for each.\n\nk=6: (-48,-83,right,36) -> span at t1: [-83, -48]\nk=7: (-48,-95,right,48) -> span at t1: [-95, -48]\nk=8: same as k=7: (-48,-95,right,48) -> span at t1: [-95, -48]\n\nNow, we need to compute for each freeway k and for each future turn T (>=72) the position of the car on that freeway, and check if at turn T the car's span covers 0.\n\nBut note: the player moves one row at a time. We start at row 0 at turn 72. We need to get to row 9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (each U). However, we have to avoid cars on rows 1-8.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 72 to turn 72+H-1 such that at turn 72+H-1, the player is at row 9.\n\nLet me denote:\n- t = 72, 73, 74, ... until we reach row 9.\n\nWe'll simulate the player's movement and check for collisions. We want the minimal H, so we try to go as fast as possible (always U) unless there is a collision.\n\nBut note: we can also use D or S to wait? However, since we start at 0 and need to go to 9, we don't want to go down below 0. Also, waiting might be necessary to avoid a car that is currently blocking.\n\nHow to check for collision for a given freeway k and turn T?\n- The car on freeway k: we know its state at t1=72. Let Δt = T - 72.\n- For a right-moving car: the span at T is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] (because the car moves right by s per turn).\n- We then check if 0 is in [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]? But note: for k=1: τ=37, h=48, s=12 -> at T=72: [37,48] -> 0 is not in there. But as time goes, the car moves right: so the interval shifts to the right. So 0 will never be in that interval? Similarly for the others: the cars on k=2 to 8 are at negative positions and moving right. So they will eventually cross 0.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway k, the time interval (if any) during which the car blocks row k (i.e., 0 is in the car's span).\n\nFor a freeway k, the car blocks at time T if:\n   τ + s*(T-72) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-72)\n\nSolving for T:\n\nFor k=1: τ=37, h=48, s=12 -> \n   37 + 12*(T-72) <= 0 <= 48 + 12*(T-72)\nBut 37 + 12*(T-72) is at least 37 at T=72, so it's positive and increasing. Therefore, 0 is never in the interval. So k=1 is safe at all times.\n\nFor k=2: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6 -> \n   -59 + 6*(T-72) <= 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-72)\n\nSolve the left: -59 + 6*(T-72) <= 0 -> 6*(T-72) <= 59 -> T-72 <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> T <= 72+9.833 = 81.833 -> so T<=81 (since T integer) for the left inequality.\n\nSolve the right: 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-72) -> 48 <= 6*(T-72) -> T-72 >= 48/6 = 8 -> T>=80.\n\nSo we require T>=80 and T<=81.833 -> so T=80,81.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: same as k=2? The car is also (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as k=2: blocks at T=80,81.\n\nk=4: same -> T=80,81.\n\nk=5: same -> T=80,81.\n\nk=6: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36 -> \n   -83 + 36*(T-72) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-72)\n\nLeft: -83 + 36*(T-72) <= 0 -> 36*(T-72) <= 83 -> T-72 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> T<=74.305 -> T<=74.\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-72) -> 48 <= 36*(T-72) -> T-72 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> T>=73.333 -> T>=74 (since T integer).\n\nSo T>=74 and T<=74.305 -> only T=74.\n\nk=7: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48 -> \n   -95 + 48*(T-72) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-72)\n\nLeft: -95 + 48*(T-72) <= 0 -> 48*(T-72) <= 95 -> T-72 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> T<=73.979 -> T<=73.\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-72) -> 48 <= 48*(T-72) -> T-72>=1 -> T>=73.\n\nSo T=73.\n\nk=8: same as k=7: T=73.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each row:\n\nRow 1: never blocked.\nRow 2: blocked at turns 80,81.\nRow 3: blocked at turns 80,81.\nRow 4: blocked at turns 80,81.\nRow 5: blocked at turns 80,81.\nRow 6: blocked at turn 74.\nRow 7: blocked at turn 73.\nRow 8: blocked at turn 73.\n\nNote: the player is at row 0 at turn 72.\n\nWe need to plan a path from row0 (at turn72) to row9 (at some turn T) without being on a row k at a turn when that row is blocked.\n\nWe can only move one row per turn (unless we stay, but that doesn't change row). So we must spend at least 9 turns (if we always go up). But we might have to wait to avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn.\n\nLet me denote the state: (turn, row). We start at (72,0). We want to reach row 9 at any turn.\n\nThe moves: from (t, r) we can go to:\n- (t+1, r) by S\n- (t+1, r+1) by U (if r<9)\n- (t+1, r-1) by D (if r>0)\n\nBut we must avoid (t, r) for which: if r is between 1 and 8, and at turn t the car on row r blocks (i.e., 0 is in the car's span on row r at turn t).\n\nWe are to minimize the total turns (H). So we want the smallest H such that we can get to row 9 at turn 72+H-1.\n\nSince we start at turn72 and row0, and we have to avoid rows 1-8 at specific turns, we can try to simulate the minimal path.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 9: then we would be at row9 at turn80 (because 72+9-1=80). But let's see if that path is safe:\n\nAt turn72: row0 -> safe (row0 is not monitored by cars)\nAt turn73: row1 -> row1 is never blocked -> safe.\nAt turn74: row2 -> row2 is blocked at turn80,81? not at 74 -> safe.\nAt turn75: row3 -> safe (because row3 blocked at 80,81, not 75)\nAt turn76: row4 -> safe\nAt turn77: row5 -> safe\nAt turn78: row6 -> row6 is blocked at turn74? but we are at turn78 -> safe? (because row6 is only blocked at turn74, and we are at 78 which is safe for row6)\nAt turn79: row7 -> row7 blocked at turn73 -> safe at 79.\nAt turn80: row8 -> row8 blocked at turn73 -> safe at 80? But wait: row8 is blocked at turn73 only? then at turn80 it is safe.\n\nBut then we get to row9 at turn81? Actually, we have:\n\nturn72: row0\nturn73: row1 (by U at turn72)\nturn74: row2 (by U at turn73)\nturn75: row3 (U at turn74)\nturn76: row4 (U at turn75)\nturn77: row5 (U at turn76)\nturn78: row6 (U at turn77)\nturn79: row7 (U at turn78)\nturn80: row8 (U at turn79)\nturn81: row9 (U at turn80)\n\nBut wait: we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9? Actually, 9 moves (each U) would take 9 turns and end at turn72+9=81? But the last action is at turn80 (which is the 9th action) and then at turn81 we are at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and we end at turn t1+H-1 at row9. So H=9? Then we output actions for turn72 to turn80 (9 actions: t72, t73,...,t80) and then at turn80 we take the last action and at turn81 we are at row9? Actually, note:\n\nThe sequence: \nAt turn t: we take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at the new row.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to row9 (if we were at row8 at turn T-1 and did U) or we were at row9 and did S? But we start at row0 at turn72.\n\nActually, we want to be at row9 at the turn when we finish the last action? The problem says: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo if H=9, then we are at turn72+8 = 80? Then at turn80, we are at row9? How?\n\nLet me index: \n- At turn72, we are at row0. \n- Then we take an action at turn72: if we do U, then at turn73 we are at row1.\n- At turn73, we take an action: U -> at turn74 row2.\n- ... \n- At turn79: we are at row7. Then we do U: at turn80 we are at row8? \n- Then we need another action at turn80: U -> at turn81 we are at row9.\n\nSo that would be 9 actions? But then the last action is at turn80, and at turn81 we are at row9. But the problem says we are at row9 at turn t1+H-1 = 72+H-1. So if H=9, then turn72+8=80. But we are at row8 at turn80? Then we are not at row9 at turn80.\n\nWe need to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1. So if we take H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1) then the state at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is row9.\n\nSo we must be at row9 at turn72+H-1.\n\nIn the above, if we do 9 moves (each U) then:\n- After 1 move (at turn73): row1\n- After 2 moves: row2 at turn74\n- ...\n- After 9 moves: row9 at turn81.\n\nSo at turn81 we are at row9. Therefore, H=10? Because we start at turn72 and take actions at 10 turns: turns72 to 81? But 72 to 81 is 10 actions? Actually, the number of actions is H, and the last action is at turn72+H-1, and then at that same turn the state is updated? Actually, the problem says:\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1. Then after the last action (at t1+H-1) we are at the next state (at turn t1+H-1+1?).\n\nWait, the problem defines: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t, and then at the next turn (t+1) we have y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn t1 (72), we take action a_72, and then at turn73 we have y_73.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That doesn't match.\n\nLet me read again: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1, so the actions are at t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at the state at turn (t1+H-1+1) = t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut according to the update: \n  At turn t1, we take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 we get y_{t1+1}.\n  Then at turn t1+1, we take action a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2 we get y_{t1+2}.\n  ...\n  At turn t1+H-1, we take action a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But then we don't need to take the action at that turn? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action we are at 9 at the same turn? That contradicts the update rule.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"Find a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\"\n\nBut the update rule is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t1, we have y_{t1} = 0 (given). Then we take action a_{t1} and then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nSo after the first action, we are at y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nAfter the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But then we haven't taken the action at turn t1+H-1 yet? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state we are in at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? And then we take an action? And then we update for the next turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\nSo at turn T, we are at row y_T. Then we take an action, and then at turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nSo the state y_T is the row we are at during turn T (and we are vulnerable to the car on that row at that turn).\n\nWe want to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1? Meaning that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions goes up to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at row9 at the next turn? But then the turn at which we are at row9 is t1+H, and we don't care about the state at turn t1+H-1? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nI think there is a typo. Let me check the example in the problem? There isn't one.\n\nBut note: the minimal H without obstacles: we start at turn72 at row0. We want to be at row9. The fastest: at turn73: row1, turn74: row2, ..., turn81: row9. So we are at row9 at turn81. Then H-1 = 81 - 72 = 9? So H=10? Then we take actions at turns72 to 81? That would be 10 actions. But then at turn81 we take an action? And then at turn82 we are at row10? That's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, if we take 9 actions: at turn72 to turn80, then at turn81 we are at row9. Then we are at row9 at turn81 = 72+9. So t1+H-1 = 72+H-1 = 81 -> H-1=9 -> H=10? But then the last action is at turn72+9=81? And then the state at turn81 is after the action? But the state at turn81 is y81 = 9, which is what we want.\n\nBut the update: \n  At turn80: we take an action (the 9th action: since t0=72, then the actions are at 72,73,...,80 -> 9 actions) and then at turn81 we get y81.\n\nSo then H=9? But t1+H-1 = 72+9-1 = 80. But we are at row9 at turn81, not at turn80.\n\nThe problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we must be at row9 at turn72+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we require:\n\n  turn = 72 + H - 1 = 71 + H\n  and at that turn, the player is at row9.\n\nBut how do we achieve that? \nAt turn72: we are at row0.\nAt turn73: row1 (if we did U at turn72)\n...\nAt turn80: row8 (if we did 8 U's at turns72 to 79)\nThen at turn80, we are at row8. Then we take an action at turn80: if we do U, then at turn81 we are at row9. But we are at turn80 and row8 -> we are not at row9 at turn80.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn80, we must have been at row9 at the beginning of turn80? But then we got there by the actions taken at turns72 to 79? \n\nBut the last action we take is at turn79: that would be the 8th action? Then at turn80 we are at row8? \n\nAlternatively, we could have been at row9 at turn80 by having done a move at turn79 that left us at row9? But we were at row8 at turn79: then we did U at turn79 -> at turn80 we are at row9. But then we are at row9 at turn80. So we need to take an action at turn79? Then the sequence of actions would be for turns72 to 79? That's 8 actions? Then H=8? But then t1+H-1 = 72+8-1=79. But at turn79 we are at row8? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> this means the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nBut the state at turn t1 is given as 0. Then after action a_{t1} at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nThe state at turn t (for collision) is the state at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action? The collision condition says \"at turn T\", and we are on freeway y_T. Then the action we take at turn T will move us to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo I believe the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t. Then we take an action and then the next state y_{t+1} is computed.\n\nTherefore, we are given y_{t1}=0 at the beginning of turn t1.\n\nThen we take action a_{t1} and then at the beginning of turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nSimilarly, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nBut how did we get to 9 at turn t1+H-1? We took actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? And then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. But then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is up to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nThis doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the actions are taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at the next state, but we don't care about the next state? We care about the state at the turn when we take the last action? \n\nBut the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are in the row, i.e., at the beginning of the turn.\n\nLet me assume the following:\n- At the beginning of turn t, we are at row y_t.\n- Then we choose an action a_t, which will determine y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n- During turn t, we are at row y_t, so we check for collision on row y_t at turn t.\n\nThen, we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9.\n\nBut then we don't take an action on turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is still confusing.\n\nAnother possibility: the actions are taken at the turns, and the state we are in during the turn is the state before the action? And then after the action, we are in a new state for the next turn.\n\nSo for collision at turn t: we are in row y_t at the beginning, then we are in that row during the turn, and then we move.\n\nTherefore, to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1 means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9. And then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} (which might be S, or U/D if possible) and then go to row10 or row8 or stay at9. But we don't care as long as at the beginning of that turn we are at9.\n\nBut then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and we are already at9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nHow did we get to9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? By the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nSo the action at turn t1+H-1 is not used to get to9, but we still have to take it? And it must be safe: but if we are at9, then there is no car (since cars are only on rows1-8), so it's safe.\n\nAnd the minimal H would be the number of turns from t1 to the turn where we are at9, and then we take an action on that turn? But we might not need to take an action on that turn if we are already at9? But the problem requires a sequence of actions of length H.\n\nSo if we are at9 at the beginning of turn T, then we can take action S (which is safe) and then stay at9 for the next turn.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we stay at9, only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at9.\n\nSo we can have: \n  At turn T (which is t1+H-1), we are at9 at the beginning.\n  Then we take any action (say S) and then we move to9 (if we were at9 and do S) or to8 or10 (but we can't go to10 because y in [0,9]? Actually, the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if we are at9 and do U, then we stay at9? Or is there a boundary? The update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then it says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So it must be clamped? The problem doesn't specify clamping, but it says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at9 and do U, then we stay at9? Similarly for D at0.\n\n So at9, U and S keep us at9? D would take us to8.\n\n So to be safe at turn T when at9, we can do S or U.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is the number of turns from t1 to the turn where we first reach9.\n\n How many actions do we take to reach9? \n  To go from0 to9, we need at least9 upward moves.\n\n  But we might take some S or D, so it might take more turns.\n\n  The soonest we can be at9 is at turn72+9 = turn81, by doing 9 U's in a row.\n\n  Then at turn81, we are at9. So we want to be at9 at turn81 = 72+H-1 -> 72+H-1=81 -> H=10.\n\n  And the actions would be from turn72 to turn81 (10 actions). But we only need to do 9 U's? What is the 10th action? At turn81, we are already at9, so we can do S.\n\n  But the actions are:\n      turn72: U -> at turn73: row1\n      turn73: U -> turn74: row2\n      ...\n      turn80: U -> turn81: row9\n      turn81: S (or U or D) -> then at turn82: row9 (if S or U) or row8 (if D)\n\n  But we want to be at9 at the beginning of turn81? In this plan, at the beginning of turn81 we are at9? No, at the beginning of turn81 we are at8 (because after the action at turn80, we moved from8 to9 at turn81).\n\n  So we are at9 at turn81, but that is after the action at turn80.\n\n  Therefore, to be at9 at the beginning of turn81, we would have to have been at9 at the beginning of turn80 and then done S at turn80 to stay at9 for turn81? But then we reached9 at turn80.\n\n  How to reach9 at turn80? \n      turn72: U -> turn73:1\n      turn73: U -> turn74:2\n      ...\n      turn79: U -> turn80:9\n\n  So then at the beginning of turn80, we are at9.\n\n  Then the actions are from turn72 to turn79: 8 actions? But then H=8? And then we are at9 at turn80 = 72+8-1=79? -> 72+8-1=79, but we are at9 at turn80, which is 72+8.\n\n  This does not match.\n\nLet me define T = turn - 72.\n  At T=0 (turn72): y=0.\n  We take action a0 at T=0, then at T=1 (turn73) we are at y1.\n  ...\n  We take action a_{H-1} at T=H-1 (turn72+H-1), then at T=H (turn72+H) we are at y_{H}.\n\n But the problem wants y_{H-1} = 9 at the state at T=H-1, i.e., at the beginning of the turn when we take action a_{H-1}? Then we are at9 at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action and move to y_{H} = 9 or 8 or 10 (clamped to9).\n\n So we want to be at9 at the beginning of turn72+H-1.\n\n The actions taken are from T=0 to T=H-1.\n\n How many actions are required to get to9? We need to accumulate +9 in the y changes.\n\n The soonest we can be at9 at the beginning of a turn is at T=9 (turn72+9=81) if we do 9 U's in the first 9 actions (at T=0 to T=8). Then at the beginning of T=9 (turn81), we are at9.\n\n So then H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\n The actions would be:\n   T=0 (turn72): U\n   T=1 (turn73): U\n   ...\n   T=8 (turn80): U  -> then at turn81 (T=9) we are at9.\n   T=9 (turn81): we must take an action? And since we are at9 at the beginning of turn81, we can take any action (safe).\n\n So the sequence has 10 actions.\n\n Therefore, in general, the minimal H without obstacles is 10.\n\n Now, with obstacles, we might need to wait sometimes, so H might be larger.\n\n We need to avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn.\n\n We are at row0 at turn72 (T=0).\n Then at turn73 (T=1): we will be at row1 -> safe (row1 is never blocked).\n turn74 (T=2): row2 -> safe (row2 is only blocked at T=8 and 9, i.e., turn80,81; but T=2 is safe)\n turn75 (T=3): row3 -> safe\n turn76 (T=4): row4 -> safe\n turn77 (T=5): row5 -> safe\n turn78 (T=6): row6 -> row6 is blocked at T=2 (because turn72+2=74) -> T=6 is turn78, which is safe for row6.\n turn79 (T=7): row7 -> row7 is blocked at T=1 (turn73) -> safe at T=7.\n turn80 (T=8): row8 -> row8 is blocked at T=1 (turn73) -> safe at T=8.\n turn81 (T=9): row9 -> safe.\n\n So the direct path (9 U's in a row, then one S) is safe? Let me verify each turn:\n\n turn72: at row0 -> safe.\n turn73: at row1 -> safe (row1 never blocked).\n turn74: at row2 -> row2 is only blocked at turn80 and 81 -> safe.\n turn75: row3 -> safe.\n turn76: row4 -> safe.\n turn77: row5 -> safe.\n turn78: row6 -> row6 is blocked only at turn74 -> safe at turn78.\n turn79: row7 -> row7 is blocked at turn73 -> safe at turn79.\n turn80: row8 -> row8 is blocked at turn73 -> safe at turn80.\n turn81: at row9 -> safe.\n\n Therefore, we can do the direct path.\n\n The actions: \n   turn72: U\n   turn73: U\n   turn74: U\n   turn75: U\n   turn76: U\n   turn77: U\n   turn78: U\n   turn79: U\n   turn80: U   -> this gets us to row9 at turn81.\n   turn81: we must include an action (since H=10, we have to have 10 actions). And at turn81, we are at row9 at the beginning, so we can do S.\n\n So the sequence:\n\n Turn 72: U\n Turn 73: U\n Turn 74: U\n Turn 75: U\n Turn 76: U\n Turn 77: U\n Turn 78: U\n Turn 79: U\n Turn 80: U\n Turn 81: S\n\n But wait, the last action is at turn81 (which is t1+H-1 = 72+10-1=81) and then at the beginning of turn81 we are at row9? \n But according to the moves, after the action at turn80 (U), at turn81 we are at row9. Then at turn81, we take action S, and then at turn82 we are still at row9.\n\n But the problem only requires that at turn81 (which is t1+H-1=81) we are at row9. \n\n However, at the beginning of turn81, we are at row9, before taking any action at turn81. \n\n But how did we get to row9 at the beginning of turn81? By the action at turn80. So the state at the beginning of turn81 is row9.\n\n Therefore, even though we haven't taken the action at turn81 yet, we are already at row9 at the beginning of turn81.\n\n So this meets the requirement.\n\n And the action at turn81 is then taken, but it doesn't affect the requirement.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 10, and the sequence is 9 U's and then one S.\n\n However, we must check that the action at turn81 (S) is taken while at row9, which is safe.\n\n Alternatively, we could do U at turn81 as well? But then we are at9 and do U, and then we stay at9 (because the grid is clamped to 9). Or does it? The update rule doesn't specify clamping, but it says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we must assume that if we are at9 and do U, we stay at9.\n\n So either S or U at turn81 is fine.\n\n But the problem only requires that at turn81 we are at9, and we are.\n\n So the sequence is:\n\n Turn 72: U\n Turn 73: U\n Turn 74: U\n Turn 75: U\n Turn 76: U\n Turn 77: U\n Turn 78: U\n Turn 79: U\n Turn 80: U\n Turn 81: S   (or U, but S is also fine)\n\n However, note that at turn81 we are at row9, and then we do S, and then at turn82 we are still at row9. But we don't care about turn82.\n\n But is there any issue with the car on row9? There is no car on row9, so safe.\n\n But wait: the cars are only on freeways 1-8. Row9 is safe.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 10.\n\n But the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H, and we found a path with H=10.\n\n However, is there a path with H<10? \n   To be at row9 at the beginning of turn72+H-1, we need at least9 upward moves. So the minimal H is 10.\n\n So we output:\n\n \\boxed{\n Turn 72: U\n Turn 73: U\n Turn 74: U\n Turn 75: U\n Turn 76: U\n Turn 77: U\n Turn 78: U\n Turn 79: U\n Turn 80: U\n Turn 81: S\n }\n\n But wait, we must ensure that during the path we never are on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn. We have checked each turn from 72 to 81 (beginning of the turn) and found safe.\n\n However, let me double-check the dangerous turns for the rows we visit:\n\n turn72: row0 -> safe.\n turn73: row1 -> safe (no car blocks at any time for row1).\n turn74: row2 -> dangerous at turn80,81 -> safe at turn74.\n turn75: row3 -> dangerous at turn80,81 -> safe at turn75.\n turn76: row4 -> dangerous at turn80,81 -> safe.\n turn77: row5 -> dangerous at turn80,81 -> safe.\n turn78: row6 -> dangerous only at turn74 -> safe at turn78.\n turn79: row7 -> dangerous at turn73 -> safe at turn79.\n turn80: row8 -> dangerous at turn73 -> safe at turn80.\n turn81: row9 -> safe.\n\n So all are safe.\n\n Therefore, we can use this sequence.\n\n But note: the action at turn80 is U, which moves us from row8 to row9 at turn81. So at turn80, we are on row8. And row8 is dangerous only at turn73. Since turn80 is not turn73, it is safe.\n\n So we are good.\n\n However, let me explicitly check the car on row8 at turn80:\n   Freeway8: car (-48,-95,right,48) at t1=72.\n   At turn80: Δt = 80-72=8.\n   The car moves right: so span becomes [-95 + 48*8, -48 + 48*8] = [-95+384, -48+384] = [289, 336]. \n   0 is not in [289,336] -> safe.\n\n Similarly, for other rows, the dangerous times are not the times we are there.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n\n But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10, which is minimal.\n\n However, note that we could potentially do it in 10 turns but with some down moves? But that would not be minimal. We are doing the minimal 9 upward moves and one extra action (which is required by H=10).\n\n So we output the sequence.\n\n But the answer format: we must output for turns 72 to 81.\n\n So:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: S\n}\n\nNote: We could do U at turn81 as well, but S is equivalent and safe. The problem doesn't require minimal actions beyond H, so either is fine. I'll use S.\n\nBut to be consistent, we could also do U at turn81. Let me check: \n  At turn81, we are at row9. Then U: we try to go up to 10, but then it is clamped to 9? The problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we stay at9.\n\nAnd there is no issue.\n\nBut I'll output S for the last action.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 72\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving upward at each turn until reaching \\(y = 9\\), and then staying in place. The car positions and movements are analyzed to ensure no collision occurs during the path:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1):** Car at turn 72 is \\([37, 48]\\) (right-moving, speed 12). The car moves right and never covers 0, so row 1 is safe at all turns.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2):** Car at turn 72 is \\([-59, -48]\\) (right-moving, speed 6). It covers 0 at turns 80 and 81. The player is on row 2 at turn 74, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3):** Same as freeway 2, covers 0 at turns 80 and 81. Player is on row 3 at turn 75 (safe).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4):** Same as freeway 2, covers 0 at turns 80 and 81. Player is on row 4 at turn 76 (safe).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5):** Same as freeway 2, covers 0 at turns 80 and 81. Player is on row 5 at turn 77 (safe).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6):** Car at turn 72 is \\([-83, -48]\\) (right-moving, speed 36). It covers 0 at turn 74. Player is on row 6 at turn 78 (safe).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7):** Car at turn 72 is \\([-95, -48]\\) (right-moving, speed 48). It covers 0 at turn 73. Player is on row 7 at turn 79 (safe).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8):** Same as freeway 7, covers 0 at turn 73. Player is on row 8 at turn 80 (safe).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 72, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as row 0 has no cars and row 1 is safe).\n- Continue moving up at each turn until turn 80, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 81.\n- At turn 81, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe as there are no cars on row 9.\n\nThis path takes 10 turns (from turn 72 to turn 81) and is minimal since at least 9 upward moves are required to go from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\), and the 10th turn is necessary to satisfy the condition of being at \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 72 + 10 - 1 = 81\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 75, starting at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (which are at y=1 to y=8). The player moves vertically: up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The grid is from y=0 to y=9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, k) for freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of the car at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y' at turn T, we are only on freeway y at turn T. So if we move from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T we are on freeway y, and at turn T+1 we are on freeway y+1. Therefore, we only check the car on the freeway corresponding to our current y at each turn.\n\nGoal: Minimize H (number of turns) and provide the sequence of actions.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 75 (t1=75). We need to get to y=9.\n\nSince we can only move one unit per turn (or stay), the minimum moves without any cars would be 6 steps (all U: from 3 to 9). However, we must avoid collisions with cars on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car movements. The cars are given at turn t1 (75). For a future turn T (>=75), we can compute the car's span.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: moves left, so the span shifts left by s*(T-t1). The initial span is [h, tau] (with h>tau because it's left? but note: the example for left is given as [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. But wait, the direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\". In our table, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nThe table:\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> note: head is -36 and tail is -47? But for right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? Actually, the description for right-moving says: initial span [tau, h] and becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So for right-moving, the initial head is h and tail is tau, but note that the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail to head (so if moving right, the head is the rightmost). However, in the table, for freeway1: head=-36, tail=-47, and direction=right. But -36 > -47, so the head is at -36 and tail at -47? Then the car spans from -47 to -36? That would be 12 units long? Because from -47 to -36 is 11 units? Let me calculate: -47 to -36 is 12 units? (including both endpoints? Actually, the number of integers from a to b is |b-a|+1. But here the span is continuous? Actually, the problem says \"span\", and collision if 0 is in the span. So we consider the interval [min, max]. \n\nFor freeway1: initial (t1=75) for a right-moving car: \n  head = -36, tail = -47 -> so the span is [min(tail,head), max(tail,head)]? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. But note the example: \n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway1: head=-36, tail=-47. Since it's right-moving, we take tau = -47, h = -36. Then the initial span is [-47, -36]. Then at time T, it becomes [-47 + 12*(T-75), -36 + 12*(T-75)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: (-30,-41,right,6) -> initial span [-41, -30]? But wait, the table says head=-30, tail=-41? Then for right-moving, the head is the leading part? Then the car is from -41 to -30? Then at time T: [-41 + 6*(T-75), -30 + 6*(T-75)].\n\nBut note: for freeway6: (60,25,right,36) -> head=60, tail=25? Then initial span [25,60]? Then at time T: [25+36*(T-75), 60+36*(T-75)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: (96,49,right,48) -> [49,96] at t1, then [49+48*(T-75), 96+48*(T-75)].\n\nWe need to avoid being at a freeway k at a turn T when 0 is in the car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at turn 75. We need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 75, 76, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn, so we need at least 6 moves (all up). But we might have to wait (S) or even go down to avoid collisions? But going down would take us away from 9, so we should avoid that unless necessary.\n\nWe'll compute the positions of the cars on each freeway for the next few turns. Since we are moving at most 1 per turn, we only need to simulate until we have taken 6 moves (and possibly some stays). But we must avoid collisions at every step.\n\nWe are going to consider the time steps starting at t=75.\n\nLet dt = T - 75.\n\nWe are at:\nTurn 75: y=3\n\nWe need to check at each turn T, for the freeway k = y_T, whether 0 is in the span of the car on freeway k at time T.\n\nWe'll simulate for each freeway the car's span as a function of dt.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): car is right-moving, initial span [-47, -36], speed=12.\n  At dt: span = [-47 + 12*dt, -36 + 12*dt]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): car is right-moving, initial span [-41, -30] (because head=-30, tail=-41), speed=6.\n  At dt: span = [-41 + 6*dt, -30 + 6*dt]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): car is right-moving, initial span [-41, -30] (same as freeway2), speed=6.\n  At dt: span = [-41 + 6*dt, -30 + 6*dt]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): same as freeway2 and 3: [-41, -30] with speed 6.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): car (head=60, tail=25, right, speed=36) -> initial span [25,60], so at dt: [25+36*dt, 60+36*dt]\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): (head=96, tail=49, right, 48) -> [49,96] -> [49+48*dt, 96+48*dt]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same as freeway7.\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at dt=0 (turn75). We need to get to y=9. We must avoid:\n\nAt turn T (dt = T-75):\n  If we are at freeway k, then we require that 0 is not in the car span for freeway k at that dt.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns. We want to minimize H, so we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nPlan 1: Go straight up: actions: U, U, U, U, U, U (6 moves). Let's check:\n\nTurn 75 (dt=0): at y=3 -> check freeway3: car span = [-41, -30] -> 0 is not in [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\nTurn 76 (dt=1): we move to y=4 -> we are at freeway4 at turn76. Check freeway4 at dt=1: span = [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nTurn 77 (dt=2): y=5 -> freeway5: same as above: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\n\nTurn 78 (dt=3): y=6 -> freeway6: [25+36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108, 60+108] = [133,168] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nTurn 79 (dt=4): y=7 -> freeway7: [49+48*4, 96+48*4] = [49+192, 96+192] = [241, 288] -> safe.\n\nTurn 80 (dt=5): y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7: [241,288] -> safe.\n\nTurn 81 (dt=6): y=9 -> no car at y=9 (since cars are only on y=1..8) -> safe.\n\nSo we can do it in 6 moves: U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the freeway3 at dt=0: we are at turn75, y=3: the car on freeway3 at dt0: [-41, -30] -> 0 is not in that interval. Then at turn76, we move to y=4: and the car on freeway4 at dt=1: [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in. Then turn77: y=5: car5 at dt=2: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe. Then turn78: y=6: car6 at dt=3: [25+36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108,60+108]=[133,168] -> safe. Then turn79: y=7: car7 at dt=4: [49+48*4,96+48*4]=[49+192,96+192]=[241,288] -> safe. Then turn80: y=8: car8 at dt=5: same as above -> safe. Then turn81: y=9 -> no car.\n\nSo in 6 moves we are done. The sequence is 6 U's.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are taking 6 moves? Actually, H is the number of turns? Let me see:\n\nWe start at turn t1=75. Then we take actions at turns 75,76,...,80 (6 actions) and at the end of turn80 (after the 6th action) we are at y=9? Let me see:\n\nAt turn75: we start at y=3. We take action a_75 -> then at the beginning of turn76 we are at y_76 = y_75 + Delta y_75.\n\nSo at the end of the sequence of H actions, we are at turn t1 + H - 1? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1}\" and then we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo if H=6, then we take actions at t=75 (t0=75), t=76, t=77, t=78, t=79, t=80 (so t from 0 to 5, H=6). Then at the end of the last action (at turn80) we are at y_{80} = 9.\n\nHow do we get from 3 to 9 in 5 steps? Actually, 6 steps: \nStart: 75: y=3\nAfter a_75 (U): 76: y=4\nAfter a_76 (U): 77: y=5\nAfter a_77 (U): 78: y=6\nAfter a_78 (U): 79: y=7\nAfter a_79 (U): 80: y=8\nAfter a_80 (U): 81: y=9 -> but wait, that would be 6 actions and we end at turn81.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, and we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIf we start at t1=75, and we take H actions at times: 75, 76, ..., 75+H-1. Then the position at the end of the last action (at time 75+H-1) is y_{75+H-1}. We want that to be 9.\n\nSo if we take 6 actions (H=6) at times 75,76,77,78,79,80, then the position at time80 is y80. How do we get y80=9?\n\nWe start at y75=3.\n\nAction at 75: U -> y76 = 3+1 =4\nAction at 76: U -> y77=5\nAction at 77: U -> y78=6\nAction at 78: U -> y79=7\nAction at 79: U -> y80=8\nAction at 80: U -> y81=9\n\nSo at time80, we are at y80=8, and then after the action at80 we are at81 at y=9. But we require that at the end of the sequence (after the last action) we are at9. The last action is at80, and then the state becomes at81: y81=9. But the problem says we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9. Here t1+H-1=75+6-1=80, so we require y80=9, but we have y80=8.\n\nTherefore, we must have the last action at time T such that after that action we are at9 at time T+1? But the problem requires that at the end of the last action (at time t1+H-1) we are at9. So we must be at9 at time t1+H-1.\n\nThis implies that we must have taken the last action at time t1+H-1 and that action must have taken us to9. But note: the update is: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at time t (current state y_t), we take action a_t, and then at time t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want at time t1+H-1 (the last time we take an action) we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? But wait: \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the position after the last action is at time (t1+H-1) + 1? But the requirement is: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me parse the indices:\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,3).\n\nThen we take action a_{t1} (at turn t1) -> then we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\n\nThen we take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> then we get y_{t1+2}.\n\n...\n\nWe take action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nWait, that would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But we haven't taken the action at turn t1+H-1 yet? \n\nAlternatively, the requirement is that at the end of the sequence, after the last action, we are at 9. But the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H}. So we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". This seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the player update: y_{t+1} is after the action at t. So at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. After action a_t at turn t, we move to y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the start of some turn. The requirement is: at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nHowever, the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1. But the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}. We require that state to be 9. But we haven't taken the action at turn t1+H-1 yet? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd we require that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at 9? But that would be at time t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So that would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 to go to y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about y_{t1+H}? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that we take H-1 actions? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: the state y_{t1+H-1} is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. To have that state be 9, we must have reached 9 by the beginning of turn t1+H-1, meaning we took actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 to get to 9 by the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1, we take an action (the last one) but we are already at 9. But if we are at 9, and we take an action, we might move away? \n\nBut the requirement is only that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. And we take an action at that turn? But that action might move us away? However, the problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9, just that at that turn we are at 9. But we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we are done? Then why take an action? \n\nAlternatively, the sequence of H actions leads to the state at the beginning of turn t1+H being 9? But then the index would be y_{t1+H}. \n\nI suspect there is an off-by-one error. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut in the update rule: the action at time t determines y_{t+1}. \n\nSo after the last action (at time t1+H-1), we get y_{t1+H}. So to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H, we require y_{t1+H}=9. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem? There is no example.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\". And the sequence is for H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1). Then the state we care about is at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps H is the number of turns we simulate, and we take actions at each turn until we are at 9. But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nHow can we be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? That means we arrived at 9 at the end of the previous action (which was at turn t1+H-2). \n\nSo we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (so H-1 actions) to get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take one more action at turn t1+H-1? But that might move us away. \n\nBut the problem says we take H actions (from t=0 to H-1) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. This means the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are at 9? But we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we are at 9 before taking that action. Then we take the action, which might move us, but we don't care as long as at the beginning of that turn we were 9.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense. Why take an action at the turn when we are already at the goal?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions until we reach 9, and the last action is the one that brings us to 9. So we require y_{t1+H} = 9. And we take H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9.\n\nI think this is the intended meaning. But the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me read the problem again: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nAnd the answer format: we output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9. But at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} and move to y_{t1+H}. But the requirement is only on y_{t1+H-1}, not on y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action (which might move us to 8,10, or stay at9) but we don't care as long as at the beginning of that turn we were at9.\n\nThis is odd. Why require to be at9 at the beginning of the turn and then take an action that might move us away? \n\nPerhaps the game ends when we reach 9, and we don't take an action on the turn we are at9? But the problem says we take a sequence of actions until we are at9 at the beginning of a turn.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we are at9 at the beginning of turn T, and we stop. But the sequence of actions is taken from turn t1 until the turn before we are at9? \n\nFor example, to go from 3 to 9, we need to take actions at turns 75,76,77,78,79,80 (6 actions) and then at the beginning of turn81 we are at9. So we require y_{81}=9. Then H would be the number of actions, which is 6, and we require y_{t1+H}=81=75+6=81 -> y81=9. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nIn this case, t1+H-1 = 75+6-1=80, and we would require y80=9, but we are at9 at turn81.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So we require that at the beginning of turn75+H-1, we are at9. \n\nFor example, if we can be at9 at the beginning of turn80 (which is 75+5), then H-1 = 5, so H=6, and we are at9 at turn80 (t1+H-1=75+5=80). But how do we get to9 at turn80? \n\nWe start at turn75: y75=3.\n\nWe take action at75 -> y76\nat76 -> y77\nat77 -> y78\nat78 -> y79\nat79 -> y80\n\nWe want y80=9.\n\nSo we need to go from 3 to 9 in 5 moves: that would require moving 6 units in 5 moves? Impossible because each move is at most 1.\n\nSo we must be at9 at a later turn.\n\nLet me calculate the turn when we can be at9:\n\nStart: y75=3.\n\nAfter k moves (actions at75,76,...,75+k-1), we are at y_{75+k} = 3 + (number of U - number of D) in k moves.\n\nTo be at9, we need 3 + net_up = 9 -> net_up=6. Since each U gives +1 and D gives -1, the minimal number of moves is 6 (if we do only U). And we will be at9 at turn75+6 = 81.\n\nTherefore, we require y81=9. But the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9. So we need 75+H-1=81 -> H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nThen the sequence has 7 actions: at turns75 to 81? But then we would be at9 at turn82? \n\nWith 6 actions (at75 to80) we get to y81=9. So to have y_{t1+H-1}=y81=9, we need t1+H-1=81 -> 75+H-1=81 -> H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nBut then the sequence would be 7 actions? But we only need 6 actions to get there.\n\nThis is a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the index of the state is after the action of the same turn? But the update rule is clear: action at turn t updates to state at turn t+1.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume that the intended meaning is that we take H actions and then the state at turn t1+H is 9. But the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nAnother possibility: the problem considers the turn index differently. Or perhaps \"turns\" here means the number of state transitions.\n\nGiven the time, and since in the first plan we are safe, I will output the 6 U's and see what happens.\n\nBut let me check the requirement: the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". With 6 actions, we have H=6, then t1+H-1=75+5=80, and we require y80=9. But we are at y80=8. So we are not at9 at turn80.\n\nTo have y80=9, we would have to be at9 at the beginning of turn80. That means we must have arrived at9 by turn79. So we need to go from3 to9 in 4 moves? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, the soonest we can be at9 is at turn81. So we require y81=9. Then we must have t1+H-1=81 -> 75+H-1=81 -> H=7.\n\nBut with H=7, we take actions at turns75 to 81. We want y81=9. But with 6 actions we are at9 at turn81. So the action at turn81 is not needed? Or we can do an extra action at turn81, but we are already at9.\n\nWe can do: actions at75 to80: U,U,U,U,U,U, and then at turn81: we do S (stay) or U (but U would take us to10 which is invalid) or D (down to8) but then we are not at9.\n\nSo to have y81=9, we can do the same 6 U's and then at turn81 we do nothing? But the sequence must include turn81.\n\nAlternatively, we can reach 9 earlier? No.\n\nOr we can use a different path that arrives at9 at turn80? How?\n\nWe start at3 at75. After 5 actions (at75 to79), we are at turn80. To be at9 at turn80, we need to have moved up 6 steps in 5 actions: which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must have y81=9. So we require t1+H-1=81 -> H=7.\n\nThen the sequence is actions at75,76,77,78,79,80,81. But we want to be at9 at the beginning of turn81. So we need to arrive at9 by turn80? No, at the beginning of turn81 we are at y81. We want y81=9.\n\nWith actions from75 to80: 6 U's, we get y81=9. Then at turn81, we are at9, and we take an action. But we are already at9, so we must do S (stay) to remain at9. But then the sequence has 7 actions: 6 U's and one S.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. H=7. But we could have stopped after 6 actions? But the requirement is to be at9 at the beginning of turn81, which we are, and then we take an action at turn81. But the action at turn81 is part of the sequence.\n\nThis is not minimal in the sense of time, because we are at9 at turn81 and then we do an extra action.\n\nBut the minimal H is the minimal number of turns (actions) such that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at9. With H=7, we are at9 at turn81 = t1+6 = 75+6=81, and 81 = t1+H-1 = 75+7-1=81. So it fits.\n\nIf we try to use H=6, then we require y_{75+6-1}=y80=9, which we cannot achieve.\n\nTherefore, we must use H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to be at9 at an earlier turn? For example, turn80? Only if we can move faster, but we can't.\n\nAlternatively, we could move down and then up to avoid cars, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nThen the sequence: 6 U's and then one S at the end.\n\nLet's write the actions:\n\nTurn75: U -> y76=4\nTurn76: U -> y77=5\nTurn77: U -> y78=6\nTurn78: U -> y79=7\nTurn79: U -> y80=8\nTurn80: U -> y81=9\nTurn81: S -> y82=9  // we are at9, so we stay\n\nBut the requirement is that at the beginning of turn81 ( before action) we are at9. But at the beginning of turn81, we are at y81. With the actions up to turn80, we have y81=9. So at the beginning of turn81, we are at9. Then we take action S at turn81, and then y82=9. But the requirement is only that at the beginning of turn81 we are at9. The action at turn81 is taken, but we are at9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nSo the sequence has 7 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,S.\n\nBut is the action at turn81 necessary? The requirement is to provide a sequence of H=7 actions, and we are at9 at the beginning of turn81 (which is t1+6 = 75+6=81, and t1+H-1=75+7-1=81).\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut is there a way to achieve being at9 at an earlier turn? For example, at turn80? Only if we start higher or move faster, which we can't.\n\nOr if we take a different path that might be faster? For example, if we can avoid waiting, but in this case we didn't wait.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at9 at turn80? That would require net +6 in 5 actions. Impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut earlier I thought the car avoidance was safe for the 6 U's, so the only issue is the index.\n\nNow, with H=7, we are safe for turns75 to80 as before, and at turn81 we are at9, so no car there. Then we take action S at turn81, which is safe.\n\nBut do we collide at any turn? Let's check for the new turn81 action: we are at y81=9, and we do S. But at turn81, we are on freeway9? There is no freeway9 with cars, so safe.\n\nBut we must check for each turn from75 to81 the state at the beginning of the turn and the action taken.\n\nAt turn75: we start at y=3. Action U. Then we move to y=4 at turn76.\n\nCollision check at turn75: we are at y=3. Car on freeway3 at dt=0: [-41, -30] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt turn76: we are at y=4. Action U. Car on freeway4 at dt=1 (since dt= turn76-75=1): [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn77: y=5, action U. Car on freeway5 at dt=2: [-41+12, -30+12]=[-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nAt turn78: y=6, action U. Car on freeway6 at dt=3: [25+36*3, 60+36*3]=[25+108,60+108]=[133,168] -> safe.\n\nAt turn79: y=7, action U. Car on freeway7 at dt=4: [49+48*4,96+48*4]=[49+192,96+192]=[241,288] -> safe.\n\nAt turn80: y=8, action U. Car on freeway8 at dt=5: same as above [49+48*5, 96+48*5]=[49+240,96+240]=[289,336] -> safe.\n\nAt turn81: we are at y=9. Action S. No car on freeway9 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=7 that might be safer? We are already safe.\n\nBut is there a sequence with fewer than 7 actions? We established that we cannot be at9 before turn81, so H cannot be less than 7.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn75: U\nTurn76: U\nTurn77: U\nTurn78: U\nTurn79: U\nTurn80: U\nTurn81: S\n\nBut note: at turn81 we are at9 and we do S, which is unnecessary but required because we must provide 7 actions.\n\nWe could do any action at turn81? But if we do U, we go to10 which is invalid (y in [0,9]). Similarly, D would go to8. So we must do S to stay at9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=7. Is there a sequence with H=7 that ends earlier? No, because we must be at9 at the beginning of turn81.\n\nAlternatively, if we can be at9 at turn80 by a different path, then H could be6. But that's impossible.\n\nOr if we take a detour? For example, go down then up? That would take more turns, so H would be larger.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is7.\n\nSo this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 75\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 7.

Only at the next turn (T+1) will the player be on y_{T+1}. So at turn T, we check the car on y_T, and at turn T+1, we check the car on y_{T+1}.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- Actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y unchanged). Note that the grid is from y=0 to y=9, so we must stay within [0,9].\n\nGoal: minimal H and sequence of actions from turn t1 (78) to turn t1+H-1 such that at turn t1+H-1 the player is at y=9.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 at turn 78.\n\nWe cannot be on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T if the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at T.\n\nCar movement:\n- Right-moving: at turn T, the car's span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (since at t1, the span was [τ, h] for right-moving). Note: the problem states for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n- Left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let's check:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> note: head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, the head is the front, so if moving right, the head is at a higher x than the tail. Here, 48>37, so the span is [37,48] at t1? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning that the tail is at τ and head at h? So for freeway1: τ=37, h=48? Then at time T, the span is [37 + 12*(T-78), 48 + 12*(T-78)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the entire car moves to the right.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> at t1: τ=-83, h=-48? Then at T: [-83 + 36*(T-78), -48 + 36*(T-78)].\n\nWe are concerned about whether 0 is in the span at a particular turn T.\n\nWe need to plan a path from y=0 (at turn78) to y=9 (at some turn) without being at a freeway y (1..8) at a turn T when the car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the turns when the car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nNote: at y=0 and y=9 there are no cars? The problem only mentions cars on freeways y=1..8. So at y=0 and y=9, no collision can occur.\n\nSo we start at y=0 at turn78, and we want to end at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe can only change one y per turn (by -1,0,1). So the minimal number of moves in terms of vertical steps is 9 (if we go up every time). But we might have to wait (use S or even D) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the actions.\n\nWe can model this as a state: (turn, y) and we want to go from (78,0) to (?,9) with minimal turns. The state space: turn can be from 78 up to ... we don't know, but we can simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nConstraints:\n- At each turn, we choose an action (U,D,S) that leads to a new y in [0,9].\n- At a state (T, y), if y is between 1 and 8, we must check the car on freeway y at turn T: is 0 in the car's span at turn T?\n\nHow to check for a freeway k at turn T:\n- We have the car data for freeway k at t1 (turn78). \n- For freeway k, we have: (h, τ, d, s). All are right-moving in this instance.\n\nSo for a freeway k, the car's span at turn T (relative to t1, so delta = T-78) is:\n  [τ + s*(T-78), h + s*(T-78)]   [because right-moving]\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [τ + s*(T-78), h + s*(T-78)]?\n\nBut note: the problem says the car is defined at t1 and then moves. Also, the span at T is a continuous interval? Actually, the car is a contiguous block? The problem says \"span\", so we assume [min, max] inclusive.\n\nBut note: for freeway1: τ=37, h=48 -> so at t1, the car is from 37 to 48 (right-moving). Then at T, it's from 37+12*(T-78) to 48+12*(T-78). We need 0 to be in that interval?\n\nSo condition: \n   τ + s*(T-78) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-78)\n\nBut note: for right-moving, the tail is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: at t1, the car is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h? So if τ < h, then the car is from τ to h. Then when moving right, the entire segment moves. So at T, the car is from τ + s*(T-78) to h + s*(T-78). Therefore, we require:\n\n   τ + s*(T-78) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-78)\n\nBut note: for freeway1: τ=37, h=48, s=12. Then at T=78: [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48]. At T=79: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> 0 not in [49,60]. We can see that the car is moving to the right and never hits 0? Because the car starts at 37 and moves right, so it only goes further away.\n\nSimilarly, let's check freeway2: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> wait, the head is -48 and tail is -59? But for right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? Here, -48 > -59, so the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]. Then at T: [-59 + 6*(T-78), -48 + 6*(T-78)].\n\nWe need 0 to be in [-59 + 6*(T-78), -48 + 6*(T-78)].\n\nSolve:\n   -59 + 6*(T-78) <= 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-78)\n\nFirst inequality: \n   -59 + 6*(T-78) <= 0 \n   => 6*(T-78) <= 59\n   => T-78 <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> T <= 78+9 = 87? but 9.833 -> T<=87? Actually, let's compute:\n\n   T-78 <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> so T <= 78+9.833 -> T<=87.833 -> so T from 78 to 87? But we need to check the second inequality.\n\nSecond inequality:\n   0 <= -48 + 6*(T-78)\n   => 48 <= 6*(T-78)\n   => T-78 >= 48/6 = 8\n   => T >= 78+8 = 86\n\nSo T must be at least 86 and at most 87.833 (so T=86,87) because T is integer.\n\nAt T=86:\n   span = [-59 + 6*(86-78) = -59 + 6*8 = -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0] -> so [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? The interval is inclusive? So at T=86, the car covers -11 to 0, so 0 is included -> collision if the player is on freeway2 at T=86.\n\nAt T=87:\n   span = [-59+6*9 = -59+54 = -5, -48+54=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is included.\n\nAt T=88: [-59+6*10 = -59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo freeway2 is dangerous at T=86 and T=87.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,4,5: same as freeway2? \nFreeway3: (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as freeway2? \nFreeway4: same\nFreeway5: same\n\nBut freeway6: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> tail=-83, head=-48, s=36.\n\nCondition: \n   -83 + 36*(T-78) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-78)\n\nFirst inequality: \n   -83 + 36*(T-78) <= 0 \n   => 36*(T-78) <= 83 \n   => T-78 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> T<=80.305 -> T<=80\n\nSecond inequality:\n   0 <= -48 + 36*(T-78)\n   => 48 <= 36*(T-78)\n   => T-78 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> T>=79.333 -> T>=80\n\nSo T must be at least 80 and at most 80.305 -> only T=80.\n\nAt T=80: \n   span = [-83+36*(2)= -83+72=-11, -48+72=24] -> [-11,24] -> includes 0.\n\nSo freeway6 is dangerous only at T=80.\n\nFreeway7: (-48,-95,right,48) \nCondition:\n   -95 + 48*(T-78) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-78)\n\nFirst inequality:\n   -95 +48*(T-78) <=0 -> 48*(T-78)<=95 -> T-78<=95/48≈1.979 -> T<=79.979 -> T<=79\n\nSecond inequality:\n   0<= -48+48*(T-78) -> 48<=48*(T-78) -> T-78>=1 -> T>=79\n\nSo T=79.\n\nAt T=79: span = [-95+48*1 = -47, -48+48=0] -> [-47,0] -> includes 0.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? (-48,-95,right,48) -> same, so dangerous at T=79.\n\nSummary of dangerous (freeway, turn) pairs:\n\nfreeway2: T=86,87\nfreeway3: same as freeway2? -> T=86,87\nfreeway4: T=86,87\nfreeway5: T=86,87\nfreeway6: T=80\nfreeway7: T=79\nfreeway8: T=79\n\nBut note: freeway1: never dangerous because the car is at positive x and moving right.\n\nSo we have to avoid:\n- On freeway7 or 8 at T=79 -> so if we are on freeway7 or 8 at turn79, we crash.\n- On freeway6 at T=80 -> crash.\n- On freeway2,3,4,5 at T=86 or 87 -> crash.\n\nWe start at turn78 at y=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal path would be 9 consecutive Ups: then we would be at y=9 at turn78+9-1 = turn87.\n\nBut let's check what happens if we go straight up:\n\nTurn78: y=0 -> safe (no car at y=0)\nTurn79: we move to y=1? But at turn79, we are at y=1? But freeway1: at turn79, we check the car on freeway1: \n   freeway1: [37+12*(79-78)=37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at y=1 at turn79? Then we check freeway1 at turn79: safe.\n\nTurn80: we move to y=2 -> check freeway2 at turn80: \n   freeway2: [-59+6*(80-78)= -59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway6 is dangerous at turn80? But we are at freeway2 at turn80, so we don't check freeway6? We only check the freeway we are on.\n\nSo at turn80, we are on freeway2: we check freeway2 -> safe.\n\nTurn81: move to y=3 -> check freeway3 at turn81: \n   freeway3: [-59+6*(81-78)= -59+18=-41, -48+18=-30] -> [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nTurn82: y=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3? -> [-59+6*4=-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe.\n\nTurn83: y=5 -> freeway5: [-59+6*5=-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n\nTurn84: y=6 -> freeway6: at turn84, we check freeway6: \n   freeway6: [-83+36*(84-78)= -83+36*6=-83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> [133,168] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway6 was dangerous at T=80, but that was 4 turns ago. So safe.\n\nTurn85: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn85: \n   freeway7: [-95+48*(85-78)= -95+48*7=-95+336=241, -48+336=288] -> [241,288] -> safe.\n\nTurn86: y=8 -> freeway8: at turn86: \n   freeway8: same as freeway7? [-95+48*8=-95+384=289, -48+384=336] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: we are at y=8 at turn86? Then we are on freeway8 at turn86? The car on freeway8 at turn86: we have to check. But freeway8 is dangerous at T=79? At T=86, it's safe? Yes, because we computed for freeway8: dangerous only at T=79.\n\nSo then turn87: we move to y=9 -> and we are done at turn87 (which is t1+9: 78+9=87).\n\nSo the sequence: 9 Ups.\n\nBut wait: at turn86, we are at y=8. Then at turn87 we move to y=9. But note: at turn86, we are on freeway8? And we said freeway8 at turn86 is safe. Then at turn87 we are at y=9 and done.\n\nBut what about the danger on freeway2,3,4,5 at T=86? We were not on them at T=86? We were at freeway8 at T=86, so we don't check freeway2,3,4,5.\n\nSo the straight path of 9 Ups seems safe?\n\nBut wait: at turn86, we are at y=8 (freeway8) and that's safe. Then at turn87 we go to y=9 and finish.\n\nBut what about the danger at T=87? \nAt T=87, we are at y=9? So we are not on any freeway (freeways are 1-8) and y=9 is safe. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the danger on freeway2,3,4,5 at T=87: we are not on any of those at T=87 because we are at y=9? So we avoid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9? And the sequence is 9 Ups.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous turns:\n\nfreeway2: dangerous at T=86 and 87 -> but we are at y=8 at T=86 and y=9 at T=87 -> so we avoid freeway2 at T=86 and T=87? Yes.\n\nBut what if we were on freeway2 at T=86? Then we crash. But we are not: we are at freeway8 at T=86.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,4,5: same.\n\nfreeway6: dangerous only at T=80 -> we are at freeway2 at T=80? So we are not on freeway6 -> safe.\n\nfreeway7: dangerous at T=79 -> we are at freeway1 at T=79 -> safe.\n\nfreeway8: dangerous at T=79 -> we are at freeway1 at T=79 -> safe.\n\nSo indeed, the straight path is safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn79, we are at y=1 (freeway1). And freeway1 is safe at turn79? Yes, as computed.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn79, we are at y=1? How did we get there? \n\nWe started at turn78 at y=0. Then we do an action at turn78: we choose U -> so at the end of turn78, we are at y=1? But the rule says: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn78: we do U -> so y79 = y78 +1 = 0+1=1.\n\nThen at turn79, we are at (0,1). Then we do U -> y80=2.\n\nSo at turn79, we are on freeway1 -> check freeway1: safe.\n\nBut note: what if we had to be on freeway8 at turn79? Then we crash. But we are not.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn78: U -> y=1\nTurn79: U -> y=2\nTurn80: U -> y=3\nTurn81: U -> y=4\nTurn82: U -> y=5\nTurn83: U -> y=6\nTurn84: U -> y=7\nTurn85: U -> y=8\nTurn86: U -> y=9 -> done at turn86? \n\nWait: we started at turn78 at y=0. Then:\n\nTurn78: U -> at the end of turn78, we are at y=1? But the turn index: at the beginning of turn78 we are at (0,0). After action at turn78, we are at (0,1) for the next turn (turn79).\n\nBut the problem says: we are at (0, y_{t1}) at turn t1. Then we take an action a_{t1} and then we are at y_{t1+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, we need to have taken H-1 actions? \n\nWe start at turn78: y78=0.\n\nAfter H-1 actions (at turn78,79,...,78+H-2), we are at turn78+H-1? \n\nWe want y_{78+H-1} = 9.\n\nWith 9 moves (H=9), we start at turn78 and take 9 actions: \n   at turn78: action0 -> y79=1\n   turn79: action1 -> y80=2\n   ...\n   turn86: action8 -> y87=9.\n\nSo we are at turn87 (which is 78+9-1? Wait: the turn after the last action is turn78+H-1? \n\nActually, after k actions, we are at turn78+k. \n\nWe start at turn78: without any action, we are at y78=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at turn78): we are at turn79: y79 = y78 + Delta.\n\nAfter 2 actions: at turn80: y80.\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 actions: at turn87: y87=9.\n\nSo H=9, and we are at turn87.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn78: U\nTurn79: U\nTurn80: U\nTurn81: U\nTurn82: U\nTurn83: U\nTurn84: U\nTurn85: U\nTurn86: U\n\nThen at turn87, we are at y=9 -> done.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1? So at t=0: a_{t1+0}=a78, t=1: a79, ... t=8: a86.\n\nSo we have 9 actions: from a78 to a86.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid collisions at every turn from turn78 to turn86? Because at each turn T from 78 to 86, we are at a position y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, we check the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe already checked:\n\nTurn78: y78=0 -> safe (no car)\nTurn79: y79=1 -> freeway1: safe (car at [49,60])\nTurn80: y80=2 -> freeway2: at turn80, car2: [-47,-36] -> safe\nTurn81: y81=3 -> freeway3: [-41,-30] -> safe\nTurn82: y82=4 -> freeway4: [-35,-24] -> safe\nTurn83: y83=5 -> freeway5: [-29,-18] -> safe\nTurn84: y84=6 -> freeway6: [133,168] -> safe\nTurn85: y85=7 -> freeway7: [241,288] -> safe\nTurn86: y86=8 -> freeway8: [289,336] -> safe\n\nAnd then we are done at the state of turn86 (which leads to y87=9, but we don't take an action at turn87? because the last action is at turn86).\n\nSo the sequence is 9 Ups.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions at the turn when we are on the freeway. And we are never on a freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". H is the number of turns? The sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1? So H=9.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? The minimal vertical moves is 9, so H cannot be less than 9.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nBut note: what if we try to go faster? We can only move one per turn. So 9 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the player update: we can only move by -1,0,1. So to go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 Ups. So minimal H is 9.\n\nBut what about using S or D? That would require more moves. So we don't want that.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. We have shown that the straight path is safe.\n\nHowever, let me double-check freeway2 at turn80: \n   freeway2: at turn80: delta=2 -> [τ + s*2, h + s*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway2 at turn80 is at [-47,-36]? That is left of 0? So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn84: \n   freeway6: delta=84-78=6 -> [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway6 was dangerous at turn80? But we were on freeway2 at turn80, so we don't care about freeway6 at that time.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 9 Ups.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". We have H=9 and the sequence above.\n\nBut the answer format requires:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for t_1=78:\n\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn86, which is t1+8. So we have 9 lines.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nHere, t from 0 to 8 (since H-1=8) -> so t=0: a78, t=1: a79, ... t=8: a86. So that's 9 actions.\n\nAnd then at the next turn (turn87) we are at y=9 without an action? But we don't need to take an action at turn87 because we have already reached.\n\nSo this is correct.\n\nBut let me check if we can finish earlier? If we try to finish at turn86? That would require being at y=9 at turn86. But to be at y=9 at turn86, we must have taken 8 moves? Because from turn78 to turn86: that's 8 actions? \n\nWe start at turn78: y78=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (turn78): turn79: y79=1\n...\nAfter 8 actions: turn86: y86=8? Then we need one more to get to 9? So we cannot be at y=9 at turn86.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, we must have started at turn78 and taken T-78 actions? and the total steps upward must be 9.\n\nThe minimal T is 78+9 = 87? Because we need 9 steps. So we must have T=87.\n\nTherefore, H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 78\\) is 9.

The dangerous turns for specific freeways (e.g., freeways 2-5 at turns 86-87, freeway 6 at turn 80, freeways 7-8 at turn 79) are avoided as the player is not on those freeways at those turns.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 78\\) to \\(t_1 + 8 = 86\\) (total \\(H = 9\\) turns) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 80, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: The player moves vertically (U, D, S) and the grid for y is 0 to 9. We start at y=2 and want to get to y=9.\n\nCollision condition: At turn T, if the player is on a freeway k (which is y=k) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is), then collision occurs.\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are considered to be on y_T at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T) and then move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe car state is given for freeways 1 to 8 at turn t1=80. Each car is described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving, the head is the rightmost and tail leftmost? Actually, the update rule specifies:\n\n- Left-moving: initially [h, tau] at t1, then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: initially [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> but if it's right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the table says: head = -48, tail = -59? and direction right.\n\nBut the update rule for right-moving says: initially [tau, h] -> so if the car is right-moving, then the initial representation is [tau, h] meaning the tail is at tau and head at h (so h > tau). But in the table, for freeway1: head=-48, tail=-59. Since -48 > -59, that's consistent: tail=-59, head=-48.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway6: (24, -11, right, 36) -> tail=-11, head=24? but 24 > -11, so that's consistent.\n\nBut wait, freeway7: (48,1,right,48) -> tail=1, head=48? but 48>1 -> consistent.\n\nSo for a right-moving car at turn t1, the car occupies [tau, h] and at time T (>=t1) it will be at [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we don't have any in this problem? All are right-moving.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and the car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span? Then collision.\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=80) the position of the car and check if 0 is in the interval.\n\nOur plan: we are going to move from y=2 to y=9. We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We want the minimal H (number of turns) to get to 9.\n\nThe minimal vertical distance is 7 (from 2 to 9). But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid cars. So H will be at least 7.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions for turns starting at t1=80, then 81, ... until the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when the car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nLet's compute the car positions for each freeway at a given turn T (relative to t1=80). Let t = T - 80, so at t=0 (T=80), we have the initial state.\n\nFor a freeway with a car (tau, h, d, s) at t1=80:\n\nIf d = right, then at time T = 80 + t, the car's span is:\n  [tau + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nWe need to know when 0 is in [tau + s*t, h + s*t]. Since h>tau, the interval is [tau+s*t, h+s*t].\n\nCondition: tau + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t.\n\nSimilarly, if d were left, we'd have [h - s*t, tau - s*t] and we require h-s*t >= 0 and tau-s*t <=0? Actually, for left the update is [h - s*t, tau - s*t] and since h>tau (as head is the rightmost) then the interval is [tau - s*t, h - s*t] but in decreasing order? Actually, the interval is from the leftmost to the rightmost: so if the car moves left, then at time t, the leftmost is h - s*t (which is less than tau - s*t? no: because if the car moves left, then the entire car shifts left. And the representation for left-moving: at t1, the head is at h (rightmost) and tail at tau (leftmost, so tau < h). Then at time t, the head is at h - s*t and the tail at tau - s*t. And because the car is moving left, the tail (which is the left end) is at tau-s*t and the head (right end) is at h-s*t. And since tau < h, then tau-s*t < h-s*t. So the interval is [tau-s*t, h-s*t].\n\nBut in our problem, all cars are right-moving. So we focus on that.\n\nSo for a right-moving car on freeway k, at time t (relative to t1=80) the car covers [tau + s*t, h + s*t].\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway k at time t (i.e., at turn 80+t) if 0 is in [tau + s*t, h + s*t].\n\nNow, let's list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: tau=-59, h=-48, s=12, d=right -> [ -59 + 12*t, -48 + 12*t ]\nFreeway 2: tau=-47, h=-36, s=6 -> [ -47 + 6*t, -36 + 6*t ]\nFreeway 3: same as 2? -> [ -47 + 6*t, -36 + 6*t ]\nFreeway 4: same as 2 -> [ -47 + 6*t, -36 + 6*t ]\nFreeway 5: same as 2 -> [ -47 + 6*t, -36 + 6*t ]\nFreeway 6: tau=-11, h=24, s=36 -> [ -11 + 36*t, 24 + 36*t ]\nFreeway 7: tau=1, h=48, s=48 -> [1+48*t, 48+48*t]\nFreeway 8: same as 7 -> [1+48*t, 48+48*t]\n\nNote: For freeways 2,3,4,5: they are identical? So if we are on any of these freeways at a time when the car covers 0, we collide. Similarly, 7 and 8 are identical.\n\nNow, we are at turn 80 (t=0) at y=2. We want to move to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\nAt freeway k (for k=1..8) at time t (>=0) if the condition holds.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's movement. We start at y=2 at t=0 (turn 80). We can choose actions: U (move up), D (move down), S (stay). But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9. We start at 2, and we want to go to 9.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as fast as possible, but we might have to wait (stay) on some rows to avoid cars.\n\nLet me compute the times when each freeway is dangerous (i.e., when 0 is in the car's span).\n\nFor freeway 1: \n  Condition: -59 + 12*t <= 0 <= -48 + 12*t\n  => 12*t >= 59? Actually, we have:\n    -59 + 12*t <= 0  => 12*t <= 59 -> t <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916\n    and 0 <= -48 + 12*t => 12*t >= 48 => t>=4.\n\n  So t in [4, 4.916] -> but t is integer, so t=4 and t=5? Let's check:\n\n  t=4: [ -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0 ] -> so 0 is included? [ -11, 0] -> yes, 0 is the upper bound.\n  t=5: [ -59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1 is dangerous only at t=4? Actually, at t=4: the interval is [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\".\n\n  So freeway1 is dangerous at t=4 (turn 80+4=84).\n\n  But note: the condition is inclusive. So at t=4, freeway1 is dangerous.\n\n  What about t=0? [ -59, -48] -> 0 not in. Safe.\n\nFor freeway2 (and similarly 3,4,5):\n  Condition: -47+6*t <=0 <= -36+6*t\n  => 6*t <=47 -> t<=47/6≈7.833\n  and 6*t>=36 -> t>=6.\n\n  So t in [6,7.833] -> integer t=6,7.\n\n  Check:\n    t=6: [ -47+36 = -11, -36+36=0] -> 0 included? [ -11,0] -> yes.\n    t=7: [ -47+42 = -5, -36+42=6] -> [ -5,6] includes 0 -> yes.\n\n  So freeway2,3,4,5 are dangerous at t=6 and t=7 (turns 86 and 87).\n\nFor freeway6:\n  Condition: -11+36*t <=0<=24+36*t\n  The left part: -11+36*t<=0 -> 36*t<=11 -> t<=11/36≈0.305 -> so t=0 is the only integer? \n  But also the right part: 0<=24+36*t -> always true for t>=0.\n\n  At t=0: [ -11,24] -> includes 0? yes.\n\n  But wait, at t=0 we are at turn80, and we are at y=2. We are not on freeway6 (which is y=6). So we don't check freeway6 at t=0? We only check if we are on that freeway at that turn.\n\n  However, note that at t=0, the car on freeway6 is at [-11,24] which includes 0. So if we were on freeway6 at turn80, we would collide. But we are at y=2, so safe.\n\n  Now, when is freeway6 dangerous? \n    We need 0 in [ -11+36*t, 24+36*t ].\n    The left part: -11+36*t <=0 -> t<=11/36≈0.305 -> so only t=0? \n    The right part: 0<=24+36*t -> t>=-24/36 -> always true for t>=0.\n\n    So only t=0? But what about t=1? \n        [ -11+36=25, 24+36=60] -> [25,60] -> 0 not in.\n        t=0: [ -11,24] -> 0 in.\n\n    So only at t=0 (turn80) freeway6 is dangerous.\n\n  Therefore, for freeway6, we must avoid being on freeway6 at t=0. But we are at y=2 at t=0, so we are safe. And for t>=1, freeway6 is safe.\n\nFor freeway7 and 8:\n  Condition: 1+48*t <=0<=48+48*t\n  The left part: 1+48*t<=0 -> 48*t<=-1 -> t<=-1/48 -> only non-positive t? \n  But t>=0, so no solution? \n\n  Actually, the condition requires both:\n    1+48*t <= 0   and   0<=48+48*t.\n\n  The second: 48+48*t>=0 -> always true for t>=0.\n  The first: 1+48*t<=0 -> t<=-1/48 -> impossible for t>=0.\n\n  So freeway7 and 8 are never dangerous? \n\n  Let me check t=0: [1,48] -> 0 not in.\n  t=1: [1+48=49, 48+48=96] -> no 0.\n\n  So indeed, freeway7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways and times:\n\n- Freeway1: dangerous at t=4 (turn84)\n- Freeways2,3,4,5: dangerous at t=6 (turn86) and t=7 (turn87)\n- Freeway6: dangerous only at t=0 (turn80) -> but we are not on freeway6 at t=0, so we don't care for movement? However, if we are on freeway6 at turn80, we collide. But we are at y=2, so safe. And for future turns, freeway6 is safe.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid:\n\n- Being on freeway1 at t=4 (turn84)\n- Being on freeways2,3,4,5 at t=6 and t=7 (turns86,87)\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at t=0 (turn80). We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe can move at most 1 per turn. So the minimal number of turns is 7 (if we move up every turn: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 7 moves, so 7 turns? Actually, we start at turn80 at y=2. After one move (turn81) we are at y=3, then at turn82: y=4, ... at turn86: y=7, turn87: y=8, turn88: y=9. So 8 turns? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid the dangerous times on the freeways.\n\nLet me write the timeline:\n\nTurn80 (t=0): y=2 (safe, because we are at y=2 and the dangerous freeways at t=0 are freeway6, but we are not on freeway6)\n\nWe plan to go up as fast as possible. But we must avoid:\n\n- At turn84 (t=4): we must not be on freeway1 (which is y=1). So at turn84, if we are at y=1, we collide.\n\n- At turn86 (t=6) and turn87 (t=7): we must not be on freeways2,3,4,5 (i.e., y=2,3,4,5). So at turn86 and 87, we must avoid being in y=2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, let's try to go up without stopping:\n\nTurn80: start at y=2 -> action U -> turn81: y=3\nTurn81: action U -> turn82: y=4\nTurn82: action U -> turn83: y=5\nTurn83: action U -> turn84: y=6 -> but wait, at turn84 we are at y=6. We are safe for freeway1 (which is y=1) because we are at y=6. So safe.\n\nBut then:\nTurn84: action U -> turn85: y=7\nTurn85: action U -> turn86: y=8 -> at turn86, we are at y=8. The dangerous freeways at turn86 are y=2,3,4,5. We are at y=8 -> safe.\nTurn86: action U -> turn87: y=9 -> we reached! \n\nBut wait, at turn87: we are at y=9. The dangerous freeways at turn87 are y=2,3,4,5 -> we are at y=9, safe.\n\nSo the sequence would be: \n  turn80: U -> y=3\n  turn81: U -> y=4\n  turn82: U -> y=5\n  turn83: U -> y=6\n  turn84: U -> y=7\n  turn85: U -> y=8\n  turn86: U -> y=9\n\nSo we reach at turn86? But let's count:\n\n  t=0 (turn80): start at y=2\n  After turn80 (action U): at turn81, y=3\n  After turn81 (action U): at turn82, y=4\n  After turn82 (action U): at turn83, y=5\n  After turn83 (action U): at turn84, y=6\n  After turn84 (action U): at turn85, y=7\n  After turn85 (action U): at turn86, y=8\n  After turn86 (action U): at turn87, y=9\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn87? Then H=8? Because we start at turn80 and go to turn87 (7 actions: from turn80 to turn86 inclusive) and at turn87 we are at 9. But the problem says: we want to reach at turn (t1+H-1) = 80+H-1. We are at y=9 at turn87, so 80+H-1=87 -> H=8.\n\nBut let me check if we avoid collisions:\n\nAt turn80: y=2 -> safe (dangerous freeways: freeway6 at t=0, but we are at y=2, so safe)\nAt turn81: y=3 -> we check freeway3 at t=1: \n   freeway3: at t=1: [ -47+6*1, -36+6*1] = [-41, -30] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAt turn82: y=4 -> freeway4 at t=2: [ -47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\nAt turn83: y=5 -> freeway5 at t=3: [ -47+18, -36+18] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\nAt turn84: y=6 -> freeway6 at t=4: [ -11+36*4, 24+36*4] = [ -11+144=133, 24+144=168] -> safe (0 not in [133,168])\n        and freeway1 at t=4: dangerous at freeway1 (y=1) but we are at y=6 -> safe.\nAt turn85: y=7 -> freeway7 at t=5: [1+48*5,48+48*5]=[241,288] -> safe.\nAt turn86: y=8 -> freeway8 at t=6: [1+48*6,48+48*6]=[289,336] -> safe. Also, dangerous at freeways2-5 at t=6: but we are at y=8, safe.\nAt turn87: y=9 -> we are at the goal, and there's no freeway above 8? The freeways are only from 1 to 8. The goal is y=9, which is not a freeway? So no car on y=9. So safe.\n\nSo this sequence works and takes 8 turns.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? The minimal number of moves is 7 (because we need to go from 2 to 9, 7 steps). But in 7 moves we would be at turn86: \n  turn80: U -> at turn81: y=3\n  turn81: U -> turn82: y=4\n  turn82: U -> turn83: y=5\n  turn83: U -> turn84: y=6\n  turn84: U -> turn85: y=7\n  turn85: U -> turn86: y=8\n  turn86: U -> turn87: y=9 -> same as above? \n\nWait, but we have 7 actions: from turn80 to turn86 (7 actions) and we end at turn87? Actually, we start at turn80 at y=2. Then we take 7 actions: at turn80,81,82,83,84,85,86. Then at turn87 we are at y=9. So we need 7 actions? Then H=7? \n\nBut the problem: we are to output a sequence for turns starting at t1 (80) and we have H turns? So the sequence is for t=80, 81, ..., 80+H-1. And after H actions, at turn t1+H, we are at the next state. But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then we have actions for t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of these actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is the state at turn t1+H. So we require that at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the above sequence:\n\n  Action at turn80: U -> at turn81: y=3\n  ...\n  Action at turn86: U -> at turn87: y=9.\n\nSo we have used actions for 7 turns: turns80,81,82,83,84,85,86 (H=7) and then at turn87 (t1+7) we are at y=9.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so we have H actions. And then the player position at the next turn (after the last action) is (0,9). So that matches.\n\nBut in the above, we have 7 actions: from turn80 to turn86. Then at turn87 we are at 9. So H=7.\n\nBut earlier I thought we had 8 turns? Let me recount:\n\n  Turn80: we start at y=2 and we take action U -> then at the beginning of turn81, we are at y=3.\n  ...\n  Turn86: we take action U -> at the beginning of turn87, we are at y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn87. The turn count: we started at turn80, and we took actions at 7 turns: 80,81,82,83,84,85,86. So H=7.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nBut is it safe? We need to check the state at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nRecall: at turn T, we are at y_T (the position at the start of the turn? Actually, the update: after the action at turn T, we move to y_{T+1}. But the collision condition: we are at turn T on freeway y_T. \n\nSo at turn80: we are at y=2 -> then we take an action, and then at turn81 we are at y=3. But at turn80, we are at y=2 and we are on freeway2? Actually, freeway2 is y=2? \n\nThe freeways are labeled by k, which corresponds to y=k. So at turn T, if the player is at y_T = k (and k in 1..8), then we check the car on freeway k.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAt turn80: we are at y80=2 -> we check freeway2 at t=0 (relative to t1=80, so t=0). \n  Freeway2: [ -47+0, -36+0] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen we take action U: so at turn81, we are at y=3.\n\nAt turn81: we are at y=3 -> check freeway3 at t=1 (because T=81, t=81-80=1).\n  Freeway3: [ -47+6*1, -36+6*1] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nAt turn82: y=4 -> freeway4: t=2 -> [ -47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn83: y=5 -> freeway5: t=3 -> [ -47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nAt turn84: y=6 -> freeway6: t=4 -> [ -11+36*4, 24+36*4] = [133,168] -> safe.\n\nAt turn85: y=7 -> freeway7: t=5 -> [1+48*5,48+48*5]=[241,288] -> safe.\n\nAt turn86: y=8 -> freeway8: t=6 -> [1+48*6,48+48*6]=[289,336] -> safe.\n\nAnd then at turn87, we are at y=9 -> not a freeway, so no check.\n\nBut note: at turn84, we are at y=6, and we don't check freeway1? Because freeway1 is y=1, and we are at y=6. Only freeway6 is checked.\n\nAlso, at turn86: we are at y=8, and the dangerous freeways at t=6 are y=2,3,4,5 -> we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of 7 ups works.\n\nBut wait, what about the dangerous time at turn84 for freeway1? We never were on freeway1. So we are safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut is there a problem? The dangerous time for freeway1 is at t=4 (turn84). We are at y=6 at turn84 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, the dangerous times for freeways2-5 are at t=6 and t=7. At t=6 (turn86) we are at y=8 -> safe. At t=7 (turn87) we are at y=9 -> not a freeway, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn80: U\nTurn81: U\nTurn82: U\nTurn83: U\nTurn84: U\nTurn85: U\nTurn86: U\n\nBut wait, at turn86 we take U and then at turn87 we are at y=9. So we have taken 7 actions.\n\nBut let me verify the y at each turn:\n\n  Turn80: start at y=2 -> then we do U -> at turn81: y=3\n  Turn81: at y=3 -> U -> turn82: y=4\n  Turn82: at y=4 -> U -> turn83: y=5\n  Turn83: at y=5 -> U -> turn84: y=6\n  Turn84: at y=6 -> U -> turn85: y=7\n  Turn85: at y=7 -> U -> turn86: y=8\n  Turn86: at y=8 -> U -> turn87: y=9\n\nYes.\n\nBut the problem: at turn86, we are at y=8 and we are taking action U to go to y=9. Then at turn87, we are at y=9 and we are done.\n\nSo the sequence is 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 6? That would require going up 7 steps in 6 moves? That's impossible because each move can only change by at most 1.\n\nSo 7 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{80} = U\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{81} = U\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{82} = U\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{83} = U\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{84} = U\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{85} = U\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{86} = U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: ...\", so we write:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{80} = U\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{81} = U\n...\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{86} = U\n\nBut we have 7 lines? Because t_1 to t_1+6 is 7 turns? Actually, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, and H=7, so we go from t_1+0 to t_1+6.\n\nSo the output is:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{80} = U\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{81} = U\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{82} = U\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{83} = U\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{84} = U\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{85} = U\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{86} = U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t=0,1,...,6 (7 actions).\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{80} = U\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{81} = U\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{82} = U\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{83} = U\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{84} = U\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{85} = U\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{86} = U\n}\n\nBut wait, there is a potential issue: at turn86, we are at y=8, and we are taking U to go to y=9. But at turn86, we are on freeway8? And freeway8 at t=6 (relative to t1=80) is [1+48*6,48+48*6]=[289,336] -> which does not contain 0, so safe. Then we move to y=9 at turn87.\n\nSo everything is safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if we move to a different freeway at turn T, we are still on the old freeway at turn T. So at turn86, we are at y=8, and we are moving to y=9. Therefore, at turn86 we are on freeway8 and we check freeway8 at t=6 -> safe. Then we move to y=9 at turn87, which is not a freeway.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times:\n\n- At turn84 (t=4): we are at y=6 -> freeway6: safe (as computed above) and freeway1: we are not on it.\n\n- At turn86 (t=6): we are at y=8 -> freeway8: safe, and also the dangerous freeways (2-5) we are not on them.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, and the sequence is all U's.\n\nBut wait, what if we try to go faster? We cannot because we must move one step at a time.\n\nAlternatively, could we avoid the dangerous rows at dangerous times by waiting? But in this case, we don't need to wait because we are never on a dangerous row at a dangerous time.\n\nSo the above sequence is optimal.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway1 is dangerous at turn84 only on freeway1. We are at freeway6 at turn84, so we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeways2-5 are dangerous at turns86 and 87, but we are at freeway8 at turn86 and freeway9 (non-freeway) at turn87.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nThus, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 80\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 80, the player is at \\(y = 2\\). Moving up (U) avoids collision, as the car on freeway 2 at \\(t = 0\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 80\\)) has span \\([-47, -36]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- At turn 81, the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Moving up (U) avoids collision, as the car on freeway 3 at \\(t = 1\\) has span \\([-41, -30]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- At turn 82, the player is at \\(y = 4\\). Moving up (U) avoids collision, as the car on freeway 4 at \\(t = 2\\) has span \\([-35, -24]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- At turn 83, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). Moving up (U) avoids collision, as the car on freeway 5 at \\(t = 3\\) has span \\([-29, -18]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- At turn 84, the player is at \\(y = 6\\). Moving up (U) avoids collision. Although freeway 1 is dangerous at \\(t = 4\\) (span \\([-11, 0]\\) contains 0), the player is not on freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\)). The car on freeway 6 at \\(t = 4\\) has span \\([133, 168]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- At turn 85, the player is at \\(y = 7\\). Moving up (U) avoids collision, as the car on freeway 7 at \\(t = 5\\) has span \\([241, 288]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- At turn 86, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). Moving up (U) avoids collision. Although freeways 2–5 are dangerous at \\(t = 6\\) (e.g., freeway 2 has span \\([-5, 6]\\) containing 0), the player is not on these freeways. The car on freeway 8 at \\(t = 6\\) has span \\([289, 336]\\), which does not contain 0.\n\nAfter the action at turn 86, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 87, which is not a freeway (no cars), so no collision occurs. The sequence achieves the goal in 7 turns, and it is minimal since moving from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 7 upward moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{80} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{81} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{82} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{83} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{84} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{85} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{86} = U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 84. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs if at any turn T, when the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=0 and want to go to y=9, we'll mostly be moving up, but might need to stay or move down to avoid cars.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you are only considered on the freeway at the turn when you are there. Specifically, if you move to a new freeway at turn T, you are not on that new freeway until the next turn. Let me read that carefully.\n\n\"Note that if you decide to move to \\( y_{T+1} \\neq y_{T} \\) at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on \\( y_{T+1} \\) at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on \\( y_{T+1} \\) if \\( 0 \\in \\text{Span}(T) \\) but \\( 0 \\notin \\text{Span}(T+1) \\).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are only on freeway y_T. If you move during turn T to y_{T+1}, you arrive at y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1, so at turn T, you are still on y_T.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on the car positions at that exact turn T.\n\nSo, for the player to be safe on a freeway at turn T, when y_T = k, then for that freeway k, at turn T, 0 should not be in the span of any car on freeway k.\n\nNow, the cars are moving with constant speed. The span changes linearly with time.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 84.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, I have the car state at turn t_1.\n\nThe cars are given with head h, tail τ, direction d, and speed s.\n\nDirection: left-moving or right-moving. In the update, for left-moving, span goes from h to τ, and it moves left, so positions decrease. For right-moving, span goes from τ to h, and it moves right, positions increase.\n\nLet's clarify the span definition.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h to τ, but since it's moving left, if h is the head, and it's left-moving, head should be on the left, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but it doesn't specify which is larger. Probably, for left-moving, h is the left end, τ is the right end or something? No.\n\nIt says: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo, for left-moving, the span at t_1 is from h to τ, and since it's left-moving, h should be greater than τ or less? If it's moving left, the head should be on the right if it's facing left, but in terms of position, let's think.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the span as the interval of positions occupied.\n\nFor left-moving car, at t_1, positions from min to max: since it's moving left, the left end is decreasing, right end decreasing.\n\nBut in the notation, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but it doesn't say which is larger. However, in the update, both decrease, so if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, h is likely the head position, which for left-moving might be the right end, but the span is given as [h, τ], which might not be ordered.\n\nThis is ambiguous. Let me see the values given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48] I think? From the text.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so it lists τ then h, so [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h probably, since it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] might have h > τ or something.\n\nLet's look at freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12), direction right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48], so positions from 37 to 48.\n\nAt T, [37 + s(T-t_1), 48 + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h and τ, and both decrease.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars are right-moving, I think, from the data.\n\nLet's check the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12)  // right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) // -59 is less than -48? Positions.\n\nτ = -59, h = -48, so since right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2? (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36) // τ=-83, h=-48\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nAll are right-moving, so for each, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince s is speed, and T-t_1 is time difference.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is within Span(T) for that freeway.\n\nThat is, min(Span(T)) ≤ 0 ≤ max(Span(T))\n\nSince the span is an interval.\n\nNow, for the player, we start at y=0 at t=84.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if we move up every turn.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, since cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", and when at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut at turn T, if y_T =0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, we need to be safe when on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe critical point is when we are on a freeway, we need that at that turn, 0 not in car span for that row.\n\nSince the cars are moving, we need to find for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nThen, for the times we are on that row, it should not be during those times.\n\nBut since we move step by step, we need to simulate the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the time intervals when 0 is occupied, i.e., collision would occur if player is on that row at that turn.\n\nSince turns are discrete, we can find the turns T where for a given k, 0 in Span(T) for freeway k.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSet t_1 = 84.\n\nSo let ΔT = T - t_1, so T = t_1 + ΔT = 84 + ΔT\n\nThen for freeway k, Span at ΔT: [τ_k + s_k ΔT, h_k + s_k ΔT]\n\n0 is in this span if:\n\nτ_k + s_k ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h_k + s_k ΔT\n\nSince for right-moving, τ_k ≤ h_k, so min is τ_k + s_k ΔT, max is h_k + s_k ΔT.\n\nSo:\n\nτ_k + s_k ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h_k + s_k ΔT\n\nWhich is:\n\nτ_k + s_k ΔT ≤ 0  ⇒ s_k ΔT ≤ -τ_k ⇒ ΔT ≤ -τ_k / s_k\n\nAnd 0 ≤ h_k + s_k ΔT ⇒ s_k ΔT ≥ -h_k ⇒ ΔT ≥ -h_k / s_k\n\nSince s_k > 0.\n\nSo ΔT must satisfy:\n\n- h_k / s_k ≤ ΔT ≤ - τ_k / s_k\n\nBecause from above:\n\nΔT ≥ -h_k / s_k\n\nAnd ΔT ≤ -τ_k / s_k\n\nNow, since τ_k ≤ h_k, and s_k >0, -h_k / s_k ≤ -τ_k / s_k, so the interval is [ -h_k / s_k , -τ_k / s_k ]\n\nΔT is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nΔT is the offset from t_1, so at turn T=84 + ΔT.\n\nFor each freeway, I can compute the values.\n\nFirst, list all freeways with their τ, h, s.\n\nFreeway 1: τ=37, h=48, s=12, direction right\n\nFreeway 2: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nFreeway 4: same, τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nFreeway 5: same, τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nAre these different freeways? Yes, each row has its own car.\n\nFreeway 6: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nFreeway 7: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48\n\nFreeway 8: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48\n\nNow, for each, compute the ΔT range where 0 is in span.\n\nFor freeway k, ΔT_min,k = ceil( -h_k / s_k )\n\nΔT_max,k = floor( -τ_k / s_k )\n\nSince ΔT must be integer.\n\nFrom inequality:\n\nΔT ≥ ceil( -h_k / s_k )\n\nΔT ≤ floor( -τ_k / s_k )\n\nAnd the interval exists only if ceil( -h_k / s_k ) ≤ floor( -τ_k / s_k )\n\nOtherwise no collision on that row.\n\nNow let's compute for each.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: h=48, τ=37, s=12\n\n- h / s = -48/12 = -4\n\n- τ / s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nSo ΔT ≥ ceil(-4) = -4? ceil(-4) = -4 since integer.\n\nceil(x) is smallest integer >= x.\n\n-48/12 = -4.0, ceil(-4.0) = -4\n\n-τ/s = -37/12 = -3.083, floor(-3.083) = -4? floor is largest integer <= x.\n\n-3.083, largest integer <= -3.083 is -4? No.\n\n-3.083, integers less than or equal to -3.083 are -4, -5, ..., but -4 is less than -3.083? -4 < -3.083, so -4 <= -3.083 is true, but -3 is greater than -3.083, so -3 > -3.083, so floor(-3.083) = -4? No.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFor a real number x, floor(x) = greatest integer less than or equal to x.\n\nx = -3.083\n\nIntegers: -4 < -3.083 < -3\n\n-4 <= -3.083 is true, -3 <= -3.083 is false because -3 > -3.083.\n\nSo greatest integer <= -3.083 is -4.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(x) = smallest integer >= x.\n\nceil(-3.083) = -3 because -3 >= -3.083.\n\nSimilarly, for -4.0, ceil(-4.0) = -4, floor(-4.0) = -4.\n\nBack to freeway 1:\n\n- h/s = -48/12 = -4.0\n\n- τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.0833\n\nΔT must satisfy:\n\nΔT >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil(-4.0) = -4\n\nΔT <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor(-3.0833) = -4? floor(-3.0833) = -4? -4 <= -3.0833 is true, and -3 > -3.0833, so yes, floor is -4.\n\nThen ΔT >= -4 and ΔT <= -4, so ΔT = -4\n\nThat is, at ΔT = -4, which is T = 84 + (-4) = 80\n\nNow check: at T=80, ΔT = -4\n\nSpan: τ + s ΔT = 37 + 12*(-4) = 37 - 48 = -11\n\nh + s ΔT = 48 + 12*(-4) = 48 - 48 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included.\n\nAt other times? For example, ΔT = -5: τ + s(-5) = 37 - 60 = -23, h + s(-5) = 48 - 60 = -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT = -3: τ + s(-3) = 37 - 36 =1, h + s(-3) =48-36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=80, collision on freeway 1.\n\nBut T=80 is before t_1=84, so at current and future turns, no collision on freeway 1, since for ΔT >=0, span is at least τ +0 =37 >0? At ΔT=0, τ=37, h=48, both positive, so 0 not in [37,48].\n\nFor ΔT>0, span moves right, so min position larger, 0 not covered.\n\nSo freeway 1 is safe for all T >= t_1=84.\n\nΔT >=0, min position τ + s ΔT >=37 >0, so 0 not in span. Yes.\n\nNow freeway 2: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/6 = 48/6 =8? -h/s = - (h) / s\n\nh = -48, so -h = -(-48) =48\n\ns=6\n\nSo -h/s = 48/6 =8\n\n-τ/s = -(-59)/6 =59/6 ≈9.833\n\nΔT >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil(8) =8\n\nΔT <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) =9\n\n59/6=9.833, floor=9\n\nceil(8)=8\n\nSo ΔT from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSo for ΔT=8 and 9.\n\nT = 84 + ΔT, so at T=84+8=92 and T=84+9=93.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt ΔT=8, τ + s ΔT = -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nh + s ΔT = -48 + 48 =0\n\nSo span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=9, τ + s*9 = -59 + 54 = -5\n\nh + s*9 = -48 + 54 =6\n\nSpan [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=10, τ +60= -59+60=1, h+60= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=7, τ+42= -59+42= -17, h+42= -48+42= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=92 and 93 for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? τ=-59, h=-48, s=6, so same, collision at T=92 and 93.\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=92,93\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=92,93\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have identical cars? According to the table, yes.\n\nFreeway 6: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\n- τ/s = -(-83)/36 =83/36 ≈2.3056\n\nΔT >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) =2\n\nΔT <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor(83/36) = floor(2.3056) =2\n\n83/36=2.3056, floor=2\n\nceil(1.333)=2\n\nSo ΔT=2\n\nThat is, only at ΔT=2, T=84+2=86\n\nCheck: at ΔT=2, τ + s ΔT = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n\nh + s ΔT = -48 + 72 = 24? h=-48, s=36, ΔT=2\n\n-48 + 72 = 24, yes.\n\nSpan [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=1: τ +36= -83+36= -47, h+36= -48+36= -12, [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: τ +108= -83+108=25, h+108= -48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=86 for freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/48 = 48/48 =1\n\n- τ/s = -(-95)/48 =95/48 ≈1.979\n\nΔT >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil(1) =1\n\nΔT <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor(95/48) = floor(1.979) =1\n\n95/48=1.979, floor=1\n\nceil(1)=1\n\nSo ΔT=1, T=84+1=85\n\nCheck: ΔT=1, τ + s ΔT = -95 + 48*1 = -47\n\nh + s ΔT = -48 + 48 =0\n\nSpan [-47,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=0: τ= -95, h=-48, span [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=2: τ +96= -95+96=1, h+96= -48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=85.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, so collision at T=85.\n\nNow freeway 1 we have no collision for T>=84.\n\nFreeway 1 had collision at T=80, but not at or after 84.\n\nSummarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: no danger for T>=84\n\n- Freeway 2: danger at T=92,93\n\n- Freeway 3: danger at T=92,93\n\n- Freeway 4: danger at T=92,93\n\n- Freeway 5: danger at T=92,93\n\n- Freeway 6: danger at T=86\n\n- Freeway 7: danger at T=85\n\n- Freeway 8: danger at T=85\n\nThe player starts at turn t_1=84, position y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path consists of a sequence of actions from t=84 onwards.\n\nAt each turn, we choose U, D, or S, changing y accordingly.\n\nWe must not be on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- When on freeway k at turn T, it must not be that T is a dangerous time for k.\n\nSince we move step by step, we can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nStart at T=84, y=0.\n\nAt T=84, we are at y=0, which is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum turns: if no cars, we can go U each turn, reaching y=9 in 9 turns: from T=84 to T=92, y from 0 to 9.\n\nT=84: y=0\n\nAfter action at T=84, y_{85} = y_{84} + Δy, depending on a_{84}\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position (0, y_T)\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}\n\nFor collision, at turn T, if y_T = k between 1 and 8, and if for that k, at turn T, 0 is in car span, then collision.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn T from 84 onwards, when we are at y_T, it must be safe.\n\nNow, with the dangerous times:\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have danger at T=85.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=86.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 at T=92,93.\n\nFreeway 1 safe.\n\nWe start at T=84, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe direct path: go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see when we would be on which rows.\n\nSuppose we do U every turn starting from T=84.\n\nThen:\n\nT=84: y=0 (safe)\n\na_84: U, so y_85 =1\n\nT=85: y=1, now freeway 1, but at T=85, freeway 1 is safe? Yes, as we saw no danger.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have danger at T=85, but we are on y=1, not on y=7 or 8, so no issue.\n\nThen a_85: U, y_86=2\n\nT=86: y=2, freeway 2, but at T=86, is freeway 2 dangerous? Freeway 2 danger at T=92,93, not 86. At T=86, freeway 6 is dangerous, but we are on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, continue:\n\na_86: U, y_87=3\n\nT=87: y=3, freeway 3, safe at T=87.\n\na_87: U, y_88=4\n\nT=88: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\na_88: U, y_89=5\n\nT=89: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\na_89: U, y_90=6\n\nT=90: y=6, freeway 6. Now, freeway 6 danger at T=86, but T=90 is later, not dangerous. At T=86 it was dangerous, but now safe.\n\na_90: U, y_91=7\n\nT=91: y=7, freeway 7. Danger at T=85, but T=91 is later, safe.\n\na_91: U, y_92=8\n\nT=92: y=8, freeway 8. Now, freeway 8 danger at T=92? Freeway 8 has danger at T=85, not 92.\n\nEarlier: freeway 8 danger only at T=85.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2-5 danger at T=92,93.\n\nAt T=92, we are on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 is safe at T=92.\n\nThen a_92: U, y_93=9\n\nT=93: y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nBut at T=92 and T=93, freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous, but we are on y=8 and then y=9, not on those rows.\n\nIn this sequence, we are never on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nLet's list:\n\nT=84: y=0, safe\n\nT=85: y=1, freeway 1, safe (danger only at T=80)\n\nT=86: y=2, freeway 2, safe (danger at T=92,93, not 86)\n\nT=87: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nT=88: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=89: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=90: y=6, freeway 6, safe (danger only at T=86)\n\nT=91: y=7, freeway 7, safe (danger only at T=85)\n\nT=92: y=8, freeway 8, safe (danger only at T=85)\n\nT=93: y=9, safe\n\nWe reached y=9 at T=93, which is turn t_1 + 9 = 84 + 9 = 93.\n\nH=10 turns? From t=84 to t=93, that's 10 turns? Let's see.\n\nTurns: we start at T=84, after H actions, we are at T=84 + H - 1? I think I need to define the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nSet t = t_1 + τ for τ from 0 to H-1 for the action index.\n\nThe player position at turn t_1 is given.\n\nThen we apply actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we should be at y=9.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nWe start at T=t_1, y_{t_1} =0\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set to 9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when we are at y_T, it must be safe, except that at y=0 and y=9, always safe.\n\nIn the sequence above with all U:\n\nStart T=84, y=0\n\na84: U, so y85=1\n\nT=85: y=1, must be safe: freeway 1 at T=85, safe.\n\na85: U, y86=2\n\nT=86: y=2, freeway 2 at T=86, safe (danger at 92,93)\n\na86: U, y87=3\n\nT=87: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\na87: U, y88=4\n\nT=88: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na88: U, y89=5\n\nT=89: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na89: U, y90=6\n\nT=90: y=6, freeway 6, at T=90, safe (danger only at 86)\n\na90: U, y91=7\n\nT=91: y=7, freeway 7, at T=91, safe (danger only at 85)\n\na91: U, y92=8\n\nT=92: y=8, freeway 8, at T=92, safe (danger only at 85)\n\na92: U, y93=9\n\nT=93: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, we are at y=9 at T=93, after action a92.\n\nThe actions are from t=84 to t=92, that's 9 actions: a84 to a92.\n\nH=9 actions? Let's count:\n\nActions: a84, a85, a86, a87, a88, a89, a90, a91, a92 → 9 actions.\n\nAfter a92, y93=9.\n\nTurns covered: from T=84 to T=92, that's 9 turns.\n\nAt each turn T from 84 to 92, we were on y_T, and all were safe as above.\n\nT=84: y=0\n\nT=85: y=1\n\n...\n\nT=92: y=8\n\nAfter a92, y93=9, but at T=93, we are at y=9, which is the goal, and we don't need to be on a freeway at T=93 except that it's safe.\n\nThe problem says: reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=93, y=9.\n\nAnd for T=84 to 92, we were safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, we never encountered a dangerous situation.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeways 2-5 have danger at T=92 and 93.\n\nAt T=92, we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly at T=93, if we were on y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=8 at T=92, not on lower rows.\n\nBut at T=92, freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous, but since we are not on those rows, no collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=93.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut we reached in 9 turns, which is minimal since 9 steps up.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nWhat about freeway 6 at T=86? At T=86, we were on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 at T=85, we were on y=1.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 1: at T=85, we are on it, but no danger.\n\nPerhaps I should list the dangerous (k,T) pairs:\n\n- k=6, T=86\n\n- k=7, T=85\n\n- k=8, T=85\n\n- k=2,3,4,5 at T=92,93\n\nIn the all-up path:\n\nAt T=85: we on y=1, danger on y=7 and y=8, but not on them.\n\nAt T=86: we on y=2, danger on y=6, but we on y=2.\n\nAt T=92: we on y=8, danger on y=2,3,4,5, not on them.\n\nAt T=93: if we are on y=9, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can just go up every turn.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nH=9 actions: all U.\n\nBut let's write the actions from t_1=84.\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nAfter a92, y93=9.\n\nBut is T=93 the turn when we reach? At turn T=93, position is y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 84 to 92.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? The minimal H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nStarting from t_1, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=9.\n\nActions from t=84 to t=84+H-1=92.\n\nIn the box, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nIn this case, t=0: a_{84}, t=1: a_{85}, ..., t=8: a_{92}\n\nAll U.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if we could reach faster, but from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=9 earlier if we start higher, but we start at 0, so no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down or stay, but that would only increase H, so not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all U.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point we are unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, at T=85, y=1: freeway 1, cars: at T=85, ΔT=85-84=1\n\nSpan: τ + s*1 =37+12=49? Earlier for freeway 1: at ΔT=1, τ + s ΔT=37+12=49, h + s ΔT=48+12=60, [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=85: dangerous, but we not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at T=86, y=2: freeway 2, at ΔT=2, τ + s ΔT= -59 +6*2= -59+12= -47, h + s ΔT= -48 +12= -36, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=86 dangerous, but we on y=2.\n\nAt T=92, y=8: freeway 8, at ΔT=92-84=8, τ + s ΔT= -95 +48*8= -95 + 384=289, h + s ΔT= -48 + 384=336, [289,336], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeways 2-5 at T=92: for example freeway 2, at ΔT=8, τ + s*8= -59 +48= -11? s=6 for freeway 2, τ=-59, s=6, ΔT=8, -59+48= -11, h + s ΔT= -48+48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in, dangerous, but we on y=8, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in less than 9 turns. Impossible, since each U increases y by 1, from 0 to 9, need at least 9 U moves.\n\nStaying or down would not help to reach faster.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nSequence: all U for turns 84 to 92.\n\nBut turn 92 action leads to y93=9.\n\nIn the list:\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nAfter a92, y93=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=9, actions from t=84 to 92.\n\nBut is there a need to specify up to when? Since after that y=9.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at T=93 we need to do anything, but no, we reached.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving.\n\nFor example, when we move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T we are on y, and at turn T+1 we are on y+1.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps at some point, if we were to be on a dangerous row, but we are not.\n\nBut let me see freeway 6 at T=86: dangerous, but if we were on y=6 at T=86, it would be bad, but we are on y=2.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeways 2,3,4,5 are all identical, but that doesn't affect.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1, we have car, but not dangerous.\n\nSo I think the minimal sequence is all U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo H=9, actions all U.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 84\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe dangerous times for each freeway, based on the car positions and movements, are as follows:\n- Freeway 1: No danger for \\(T \\geq 84\\).\n- Freeway 2: Danger at \\(T = 92\\) and \\(T = 93\\).\n- Freeway 3: Danger at \\(T = 92\\) and \\(T = 93\\).\n- Freeway 4: Danger at \\(T = 92\\) and \\(T = 93\\).\n- Freeway 5: Danger at \\(T = 92\\) and \\(T = 93\\).\n- Freeway 6: Danger at \\(T = 86\\).\n- Freeway 7: Danger at \\(T = 85\\).\n- Freeway 8: Danger at \\(T = 85\\).\n\nThe minimal path to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\) requires exactly 9 upward moves (U), as each move increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no fewer moves are possible. The sequence of actions is simulated below:\n\n- At turn 84: Player at \\(y = 0\\), action U moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 85. At turn 85, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) is safe.\n- At turn 85: Player at \\(y = 1\\), action U moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 86. At turn 86, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2) is safe (danger only at \\(T = 92, 93\\)).\n- At turn 86: Player at \\(y = 2\\), action U moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 87. At turn 86, freeway 6 is dangerous, but the player is on \\(y = 2\\), not \\(y = 6\\), so safe.\n- At turn 87: Player at \\(y = 3\\), action U moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 88. Freeway 3 is safe at \\(T = 87\\).\n- At turn 88: Player at \\(y = 4\\), action U moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 89. Freeway 4 is safe at \\(T = 88\\).\n- At turn 89: Player at \\(y = 5\\), action U moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 90. Freeway 5 is safe at \\(T = 89\\).\n- At turn 90: Player at \\(y = 6\\), action U moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 91. Freeway 6 is safe at \\(T = 90\\) (danger only at \\(T = 86\\)).\n- At turn 91: Player at \\(y = 7\\), action U moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 92. Freeway 7 is safe at \\(T = 91\\) (danger only at \\(T = 85\\)).\n- At turn 92: Player at \\(y = 8\\), action U moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 93. Freeway 8 is safe at \\(T = 92\\) (danger only at \\(T = 85\\)). At \\(T = 92\\), freeways 2–5 are dangerous, but the player is on \\(y = 8\\), not affected.\n\nAfter 9 actions, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 93. All positions during turns 84 to 92 are safe, as verified against the dangerous times. No shorter sequence is possible, as \\(H = 9\\) is the minimum required for the vertical distance.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t1=87, and I have the car states for each freeway.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right based on their direction. The direction is given: for freeway 1, it's right, so it's moving to the right. Similarly, all cars are moving right, according to the table.\n\nLet me list out the cars:\n\n- Freeway 1: head = -36, tail = -47, direction = right, speed = 12\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at time T is [tail + s*(T - t1), head + s*(T - t1)]? Let's see the rule.\n\nThe rule says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might be confusing because τ is tail and h is head, but in the left-moving case, it's [h, τ] with h and τ.\n\nI think for consistency, head is always the front, tail is rear. So for right-moving, as it moves right, head is to the right, tail left, so at t1, positions from left to right: tail to head, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, head left, tail right, so [h, τ] with h < τ? No.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn the left-moving case: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and since it's moving left, h decreases, τ decreases, so Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the right-moving case: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and moving right, so [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (-36, -47, right, 12). -36 and -47, which is larger? -36 > -47, so if direction right, head should be at -36, tail at -47, so positions from left to right: tail -47 to head -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: (60, 25, right, 36). 60 and 25, 60>25, so if right, head at 60, tail at 25, so [τ, h] = [25,60]\n\nBut in the notation it says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for freeway 6: head=60, tail=25, direction=right, so at t1, the car spans from 25 to 60, and as it moves right, the span increases.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1: head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, so span from -47 to -36, moving right, so positions increase.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at turn T, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at time T.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t) each turn.\n\nAt turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and we check if for that freeway, at time T, the car's span includes 0.\n\nAlso, when player moves to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so at turn T, they are still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T even if 0 is in their span at T, because you're not there yet.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, you are on y_T, so if 0 is in span of car on y_T at time T, collision.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at t1=87.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, I think, since cars are on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\nPlayer can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, within 0 to 9.\n\nI need min H, sequence of actions to get to y=9.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, that's +6, so at least 6 moves up, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut we want min H, so probably try to go up as much as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when the car spans include 0 at different times.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t1, so at time T = t1 + ΔT.\n\nFor each freeway, the span at T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=12.\n\nRight-moving, so Span(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-47 + 12 ΔT, -36 + 12 ΔT]\n\nCollision if player on y=1 at time T and 0 in [ -47 +12ΔT, -36 +12ΔT ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: k=2, head=-30, tail=-41, direction right, speed=6\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-41 + 6 ΔT, -30 + 6 ΔT]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? k=3, head=-30, tail=-41, right, speed=6. Identical to freeway 2? But different freeway, but same car? Or separate cars? The table has multiple entries, so I think each freeway has its own car, but for k=2,3,4,5 all have same parameters: head=-30, tail=-41, right, speed=6.\n\nk=2,3,4,5 all have (-30,-41,right,6), so four identical cars on different freeways.\n\nSimilarly, k=6: head=60, tail=25, right, speed=36\n\nSpan(T) = [25 + 36 ΔT, 60 + 36 ΔT]\n\nk=7: head=96, tail=49, right, speed=48\n\nSpan(T) = [49 + 48 ΔT, 96 + 48 ΔT]\n\nk=8: same as k=7, (96,49,right,48)\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at ΔT=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut cars on each, so I need to be on each freeway only when 0 is not in the car span for that freeway at that time.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the times when 0 is covered change.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is in the span, meaning it's dangerous to be on that freeway at that time.\n\nFor freeway k, at time T, if 0 in Span_k(T), then collision if player on y=k.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nSo let's find the intervals of ΔT where 0 is covered for each k.\n\nStart with k=1: Span(T) = [-47 +12ΔT, -36 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in this interval if -47 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -36 +12ΔT\n\nSolve:\n\nLower bound: -47 +12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.9167\n\nUpper bound: 0 <= -36 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >= 36 => ΔT >= 3\n\nSo 0 in span when 3 <= ΔT <= 3.9167, so for integer ΔT, since turns are discrete, ΔT=3 and ΔT=4? ΔT integer.\n\nΔT = T - t1, integer.\n\nAt ΔT=3: Span = [-47 +12*3, -36 +12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is in [-11,0], yes, since -11 <=0<=0.\n\nAt ΔT=4: Span = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nAt ΔT=2: Span = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in this.\n\nAt ΔT=3: [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nAt ΔT=4: [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo for k=1, dangerous at ΔT=3 only? ΔT=3: [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, yes.\n\nΔT=4: [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, not in.\n\nBut ΔT=3: lower bound -11<=0, upper bound 0<=0, so 0 is included.\n\nNow, ΔT=3.9167 is not integer, so only at ΔT=3, it is dangerous for k=1.\n\nΔT min: 3, max 3.916, so for integer ΔT, only ΔT=3.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: Span(T) = [-41 +6ΔT, -30 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -30 +6ΔT\n\nLower: -41 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=41 => ΔT <=41/6≈6.833\n\nUpper: 0 <= -30 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=30 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo 5 <= ΔT <=6.833\n\nInteger ΔT: ΔT=5,6\n\nAt ΔT=5: Span = [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔT=6: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in since -5<=0<=6\n\nΔT=7: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo dangerous for ΔT=5 and 6.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: same as k=2, since same parameters, so also dangerous at ΔT=5,6\n\nk=4: same, ΔT=5,6\n\nk=5: same, ΔT=5,6\n\nNow k=6: Span(T) = [25 +36ΔT, 60 +36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 25 +36ΔT <=0 <=60 +36ΔT\n\nBut 25 +36ΔT <=0? 36ΔT <= -25, ΔT <= -25/36 negative, impossible since ΔT >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=60 +36ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nBut the lower bound 25 +36ΔT >0 for all ΔT>=0, since min at ΔT=0 is 25>0.\n\nSo 0 is never <= lower bound, and lower bound is always positive, so 0 never in [25+36ΔT, 60+36ΔT] for any ΔT.\n\nThus, for k=6, never dangerous. 0 is always left of the span since min position 25>0.\n\nSimilarly, k=7: Span(T) = [49 +48ΔT, 96 +48ΔT]\n\nAll positive, min 49>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nk=8: same as k=7, never dangerous.\n\nSo only freeways 1 to 5 have dangerous times, and 6,7,8 are always safe.\n\nk=1 dangerous only at ΔT=3\n\nk=2,3,4,5 dangerous at ΔT=5 and 6\n\nk=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at ΔT=0.\n\nNeed to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe freeways we care about are y=4,5,6,7,8, but y=6,7,8 have no cars? k=6,7,8 are freeways with cars, but we said they are always safe because cars never cover 0.\n\nFreeway k=6 is y=6, and since car never covers 0, it is always safe to be on y=6 at any time.\n\nSimilarly y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=1 to 5 have cars that can cover 0 at certain times.\n\nBut player starts at y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, each y level.\n\nPlayer at y=3, so on freeway 3 at ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, for freeway 3, which is k=3.\n\nk=3 dangerous at ΔT=5 and 6.\n\nAt ΔT=0, not dangerous, since only 5 and 6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3, car on k=3, Span at ΔT=0: for k=3, head=-30, tail=-41, so Span(0) = [-41, -30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, player can move up to y=4, or down to y=2, or stay.\n\nBut we need to go up to y=9.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, and y=9 safe, the only potential issues are y=3,4,5, but y=3 we are at now, safe.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which has a car, dangerous at ΔT=5,6.\n\nSimilarly y=5 dangerous at ΔT=5,6.\n\ny=4 and y=5 both have cars with same parameters as k=4 and k=5, dangerous at ΔT=5,6.\n\nk=4 is freeway 4, yes.\n\nNow, y=1 and y=2 also have cars, but since we start at y=3 and go up, we might not need to go down, so probably we can avoid y=1 and y=2.\n\nBut let's list all dangerous points.\n\nFor each freeway and time:\n\n- y=1: dangerous only at ΔT=3\n\n- y=2: dangerous at ΔT=5,6 (since k=2)\n\n- y=3: dangerous at ΔT=5,6\n\n- y=4: dangerous at ΔT=5,6\n\n- y=5: dangerous at ΔT=5,6\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\n- y=0 and y=9: no freeway, safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,3) at ΔT=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: from y=3 to y=9, need +6, so H at least 6, meaning we need at least 6 actions to increase y by 6.\n\nBut we might have stay or down moves, which would increase H.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, avoiding being on dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nNow, dangerous times are only at ΔT=3,5,6.\n\nΔT=3: only y=1 is dangerous.\n\nΔT=5: y=2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nΔT=6: y=2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nOther times, all freeways safe? At other times, for example at ΔT=0, y=1 is safe, y=2 safe, etc., except at those specific times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At ΔT=3, only y=1 dangerous\n\n- At ΔT=5, y=2,3,4,5 dangerous\n\n- At ΔT=6, y=2,3,4,5 dangerous\n\n- At all other ΔT, all y safe.\n\nNow, player at ΔT=0, y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at ΔT=H-1, since actions from t=0 to H-1, position at time t1+t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nDefine time relative to t1.\n\nLet t be the step, from t=0 to H-1, so at time τ = t1 + t, player position y_{t1+t}.\n\nΔT = t.\n\nAt step t (since t1), ΔT = t.\n\nSo at t=0, y=3.\n\nWe need y at some t = H-1 to be 9.\n\nSince we start at t=0, and after H actions, we have positions from t=0 to t=H, but the sequence is actions at t=0 to H-1, leading to position at t=H? No.\n\nClarify the timing.\n\nTurn t1: player position (0, y_{t1}) at time t1.\n\nAction a_{t1} taken, then at turn t1+1, position updated.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, position is (0, y_t), then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, we have action a_T.\n\nThen position at turn T is y_T, before action.\n\nAfter action a_T, position becomes y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn the collision, at turn T, player is on y_T, and we check if 0 in span of car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThen we choose a_T to move to y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, current turn t1=87, player at y=3.\n\nWe need to find actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1} such that after H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), which is the position at some turn.\n\nThe task: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAlso in the answer format: actions from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, and position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nLet me denote the turns.\n\nTurn index: let T = t1, t1+1, t1+2, ..., up to t1 + K for some K.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T chosen, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nWe start at turn t1, y_{t1} =3.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1 + H-1}, so there are H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9 means that at turn t1 + H -1, the position is 9, and we have performed H-1 actions? Let's index.\n\nSet T = t1 for simplicity, so turns relative to t1.\n\nTurn 0: time t1, position y=3\n\nAction a_0 (which is a_{t1})\n\nThen turn 1: time t1+1, position y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k} at turn k, position at turn k+1.\n\nWe want that at some turn M, y_M =9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from action at turn 0 to turn H-1.\n\nThen the position after action at turn H-1 is at turn H.\n\nSo y_H = y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the task says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position is y_{t1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1} at turn t1 + H -1, position becomes y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care, as long as at turn t1 + H -1, it is 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9 means at that turn, position is 9, so we have reached it at that turn.\n\nThen we stop, no need for further action.\n\nThe sequence of actions brings us to position 9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe first action is at turn t1, last at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nFrom start, at turn t1, position y=3, not 9 yet.\n\nAfter actions, at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThe number of actions is H.\n\nFor example, if H=0, but we start at y=3, not 9, so H>=1, but we need to move to reach 9.\n\nMinimal H to reach from 3 to 9.\n\nSince we need to increase y by 6, minimal H if we go up every time: H=6 actions, from turn t1 to t1+5, position at turn t1+5 should be 9.\n\ny at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nIf we go up every action, each action increases y by 1, so after k up actions, y = 3 + k.\n\nSet y_{t1 + H -1} = 3 + number of U minus number of D in the actions from t=0 to t=H-2? Let's define the actions.\n\nLet the actions be for turns τ = t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn τ, action a_τ.\n\nThen position at turn τ+1 is y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nBut at turn τ, position is y_τ.\n\nWe want for τ = t1 + H -1, y_τ =9.\n\nFor τ = t1 + H -1, the position is y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThis position is determined by the previous actions.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t= t1 + H -2? Let's see the indices.\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} =3\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k}, y_{t1 + k +1} = y_{t1 + k} + Δy_{t1 + k}\n\nAt turn t1 + m, position y_{t1 + m}\n\nThis is equal to y_{t1} + sum_{i=0}^{m-1} Δy_{t1 + i} for m>=1\n\ny_{t1 + m} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{m-1} Δy_{t1 + i}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nSo 3 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1 + i} =9\n\nBecause y_{t1 + (H-1)} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{(H-1)-1} Δy_{t1 + i} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1 + i}\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0, or +1.\n\nThe sum from i=0 to H-2 of Δy_{t1 + i} = 6\n\nSince y increases from 3 to 9, net +6.\n\nThe actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-2} affect this sum, and a_{t1 + H-1} affects y_{t1 + H}, but since we stop at y_{t1 + H-1}=9, the last action a_{t1 + H-1} is chosen such that it doesn't move or something, but it can be any, but since we reach at turn t1+H-1, we don't care about a_{t1+H-1} for movement, but it might cause collision at turn t1+H-1 if we are on dangerous y.\n\nAt turn t1 + H-1, we are at y=9, which is safe, so no issue.\n\nThe key is that during the path, for each turn from t1 to t1 + H-2, we have position y_T at turn T, and we need no collision, meaning for each T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then 0 not in span of car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute, but since t1=87, time T = t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nBut relative, ΔT = T - t1.\n\nFor each turn, at time T, position y_T, we need safety.\n\nAlso, the actions affect the position sequence.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal H if we go up every turn.\n\nSuppose H=6.\n\nThen we want y at turn t1+5 to be 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H-1} = y_{t1+5} for H=6.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+5}.\n\ny_{t1+5} = 3 + sum of Δy from a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}, because y_{t1+5} = y_{t1} + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_{t1+i}\n\nSet equal to 9, so sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_{t1+i} =6.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, we need all Δy= +1, so all actions must be U, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}, and y increases to 4,5,6,7,8 at turns t1+1 to t1+4, and at turn t1+5, y=9.\n\ny_{t1} =3\n\nAfter a_{t1}=U, y_{t1+1} =4\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}=U, y_{t1+2}=5\n\nAfter a_{t1+2}=U, y_{t1+3}=6\n\nAfter a_{t1+3}=U, y_{t1+4}=7\n\nAfter a_{t1+4}=U, y_{t1+5}=8? No.\n\ny_{t1+5} is position at turn t1+5.\n\nAfter action at turn t1+4, y_{t1+5} is set.\n\nLet's list positions:\n\nTurn T: position y_T\n\nT=t1: y=3\n\nAction a_{t1}: if U, then y_{t1+1} =4\n\nT=t1+1: y=4\n\nAction a_{t1+1}: if U, y_{t1+2}=5\n\nT=t1+2: y=5\n\nAction a_{t1+2}: U, y_{t1+3}=6\n\nT=t1+3: y=6\n\nAction a_{t1+3}: U, y_{t1+4}=7\n\nT=t1+4: y=7\n\nAction a_{t1+4}: U, y_{t1+5}=8\n\nT=t1+5: y=8\n\nTo have y_{t1+5}=9, we need another action.\n\ny_{t1+5} =8 if we did 5 up actions from t1 to t1+4.\n\nStart at T=t1, y=3\n\nAfter 1st action (at T=t1), y_{t1+1} =3 + Δy_{t1}\n\nAfter 2nd action (at T=t1+1), y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1} = 3 + Δy_{t1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{t1+k} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{t1+i}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nSo for index M = t1 + H -1, y_M =9\n\nM = t1 + H -1\n\ny_M = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{M - t1 -1} Δy_{t1+i} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1+i} =9\n\nSo sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1+i} =6\n\nThe actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-2} contribute to the sum, and a_{t1 + H-1} is the last action, but it doesn't affect y_M, since y_M is before action a_M.\n\nAt turn M, position y_M, then we perform action a_M, which sets y_{M+1}, but we don't care about y_{M+1} for reaching 9.\n\nFor y_M to be 9, the sum of Δy from i=0 to H-2 must be 6.\n\nEach Δy is integer -1,0,1, so the number of U minus number of D must be 6, over H-1 actions? Actions from i=0 to H-2, that's H-1 actions.\n\nNumber of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-2} is (H-2) - 0 +1 = H-1 actions.\n\nEach can be U,D,S.\n\nSum of Δy over H-1 actions =6.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, we need at least 6 U actions, and no D, so H-1 >=6, so H >=7.\n\nMinimal H when all actions are U, and H-1=6, so H=7.\n\nThen with H=7, we have actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+6}, and y_{t1+6} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H-1} = y_{t1+6} for H=7.\n\ny_{t1+6} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{5} Δy_{t1+i} =3 +6 if all a U from t1 to t1+5.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+5}, that's 6 actions, each U, Δy=1 each.\n\nThen y_{t1+1} =4, y_{t1+2}=5, ..., y_{t1+6}=9.\n\nAnd at turn t1+6, y=9.\n\nThe last action a_{t1+6} can be anything, but it is part of the sequence, but since we reach at turn t1+6, and y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, for H=7, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+6}, and position at t1+6 is 9.\n\nWith H=6, is it possible?\n\nIf H=6, then y_{t1+5} =9.\n\ny_{t1+5} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_{t1+i} =9, so sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_{t1+i} =6.\n\nBut there are only 5 actions from i=0 to 4 (a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}), each Δy <=1, so sum <=5, cannot be 6. Impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is 7, with 6 up actions and one more action, but in this case, to have sum=6 over 5 actions, impossible, so H=7 is minimal, with 6 U actions in the first 6 actions (from a_{t1} to a_{t1+5}), and a_{t1+6} can be S or U or D, but since y=9, if U, it might go to 10, but y max 9, so if a_{t1+6}=U, y_{t1+7}=10, but y_{t1+7} is not required to be 9, we stop at y_{t1+6}=9, so a_{t1+6} can be S to stay at 9, or U to go to 10, but 10 invalid? y must be in 0-9, so if at 9, U is invalid, I assume we cannot go beyond, so action U at y=9 not allowed, or it stays, but the dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, but constrained to [0,9], so if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1} = min(9,9+1)=9? Or max, min(9, y_t + Δy) with bounds.\n\nThe rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9, similarly if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSo it stays at boundary.\n\nBut in this case, for reaching y=9, we can have a_t=S at y=9 to stay, or U, but it stays.\n\nBut for minimal H, we don't care, as long as we reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith H=7, we can go directly up: actions all U from t1 to t1+5, then at t1+6, y=9, and a_{t1+6} can be S.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nIn this case, positions:\n\nAt turn T=t1: y=3, time T=t1, ΔT=0\n\nWe need to check for each turn T, if y_T between 1-8, and time T, if 0 in span of car on y_T at time T.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nT=t1 (ΔT=0): y=3, freeway 3, at ΔT=0, for k=3, Span= [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1}=U\n\nThen T=t1+1 (ΔT=1): y=4, freeway 4, at ΔT=1, for k=4, dangerous times ΔT=5,6, so at ΔT=1, safe. Span at ΔT=1: [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nAction a_{t1+1}=U\n\nT=t1+2 (ΔT=2): y=5, freeway 5, at ΔT=2, k=5, Span: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+2}=U\n\nT=t1+3 (ΔT=3): y=6, freeway 6, which is always safe, as we saw, no car covers 0. So safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+3}=U\n\nT=t1+4 (ΔT=4): y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+4}=U\n\nT=t1+5 (ΔT=5): y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+5}=U\n\nThen T=t1+6 (ΔT=6): y=9, safe, no freeway.\n\nBut we need y_{t1+6}=9, which we have.\n\nAt T=t1+5, y=8, after U, y_{t1+6}=9.\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nAt turn T=t1+5 (ΔT=5), position y=8, which is freeway 8, always safe.\n\nThen action a_{t1+5}=U, sets y_{t1+6}=9.\n\nAt turn t1+6, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, check for collision at each turn from t1 to t1+5.\n\nT=t1 (ΔT=0): y=3, safe as above.\n\nT=t1+1 (ΔT=1): y=4, safe.\n\nT=t1+2 (ΔT=2): y=5, safe.\n\nT=t1+3 (ΔT=3): y=6, freeway 6, always safe, no issue.\n\nT=t1+4 (ΔT=4): y=7, safe.\n\nT=t1+5 (ΔT=5): y=8, safe.\n\nAll safe, no collision.\n\nBut at ΔT=5, we are at y=8, which is safe, not on dangerous freeways.\n\nThe dangerous freeways at ΔT=5 are y=2,3,4,5, but we are at y=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=3, dangerous only y=1, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nSo this path seems fine.\n\nH=7, with actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+5} all U, and a_{t1+6} can be S or whatever, but since y=9 at t1+6, and we need to specify action at t1+6.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions from t1 to t1+H-1= t1+6.\n\na_{t1+6} can be S, to stay at 9.\n\nBut in the actions, a_{t1+5} is U, which moves to y=9 at next turn.\n\nNow, at turn t1+6, y=9, action a_{t1+6} could be S.\n\nBut we can set it to S.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path? H=7 is minimal, as we saw.\n\nEarlier I thought H=6 impossible, yes.\n\nBut in this case, with H=7, it works without any issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nAt ΔT=5: y=2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nWe are at y=8 at ΔT=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=t1+3, ΔT=3, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nBut the car states: for freeway 6,7,8, we said always safe, but let me double-check.\n\nFreeway 6: k=6, head=60, tail=25, right, speed=36, span at T: [25 +36ΔT, 60+36ΔT], min 25>0, so 0 never in, yes.\n\nSimilarly k=7: [49+48ΔT, 96+48ΔT], 49>0, yes.\n\nk=8 same.\n\nAnd for k=1, dangerous only at ΔT=3.\n\nBut we are not on y=1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, k=2,3,4,5 dangerous at ΔT=5,6, but at those times, we are on higher y.\n\nIn this path, at ΔT=5, we are at T=t1+5, y=8, not on y=5 or below.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=6, we are at T=t1+6, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, with H=7, sequence: all actions U from turn t1 to t1+5, and then at turn t1+6, action S.\n\nBut actions: from t=0 to H-1=6, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+6}.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1+5} should be U to go up, and a_{t1+6} can be S.\n\nBut after a_{t1+5}, y_{t1+6}=9, then at turn t1+6, we are at y=9, action a_{t1+6} can be S, which keeps it at 9.\n\nWe could do a_{t1+6}=U, but it stays at 9.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions for each turn.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach faster with some down or stay, but since minimal H is 7, and we can do it in 7, no need.\n\nBut at ΔT=5, if we were on lower y, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by being on y=9 earlier, but from y=3, min 6 steps to y=9, with 6 up actions, but with 6 actions, we can be at y=9 at turn t1+6, as above.\n\nWith 6 up actions, y_{t1+6} =9, which is at turn t1+6.\n\nIn terms of turns, with actions from t1 to t1+5, all U, then y_{t1+6}=9 at turn t1+6.\n\nH=6 actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+5}, then y_{t1+6}=9, which is turn t1+6.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=6, then y_{t1+5} should be 9.\n\nBut with actions from t1 to t1+5, we have y_{t1+6} =3 + sum_{i=0}^{5} Δy_{t1+i}, set to 9, so sum=6, possible with all U.\n\ny_{t1+6} =9 at turn t1+6.\n\nBut for H=6, we need y_{t1 + H-1} = y_{t1+5} =9.\n\ny_{t1+5} is not necessarily 9.\n\nIn the sequence with all U:\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn t1, y=3\n\nAfter a_{t1}=U: turn t1+1, y=4\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}=U: turn t1+2, y=5\n\nAfter a_{t1+2}=U: turn t1+3, y=6\n\nAfter a_{t1+3}=U: turn t1+4, y=7\n\nAfter a_{t1+4}=U: turn t1+5, y=8\n\nAfter a_{t1+5}=U: turn t1+6, y=9\n\nSo at turn t1+5, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1+5}=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn t1+5.\n\nThat means, from turn t1, in 5 actions, we need to reach y=9 at turn t1+5.\n\ny_{t1+5} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_{t1+i} =9, so sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_{t1+i} =6.\n\nBut there are only 5 Δy terms, each at most +1, so maximum y_{t1+5} = 3 +5 =8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus impossible to be at y=9 at turn t1+5 or earlier.\n\nEarliest at turn t1+6, with y=9.\n\nThus minimal H=7, with y_{t1+6}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+6}, with the first 6 being U (a_{t1} to a_{t1+5}) and a_{t1+6} being S, for example.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t1+6} at turn t1+6, position y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, back to the collision check, in this path, as above, all positions from t1 to t1+5 are safe, and t1+6 is y=9 safe.\n\nBut at turn t1+5, ΔT=5, y=8, which is safe.\n\nIs there any issue at ΔT=6?\n\nAt ΔT=6, for example, if we were on y=5, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nIn our path, at ΔT=6, turn t1+6, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter H by going down or something, but since we need to go up, it won't help.\n\nSo H=7 seems achievable.\n\nBut let me confirm the car at y=1 at ΔT=3.\n\nIn our path, at ΔT=3, we are at y=6, not y=1.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps for completeness, let's see the spans at critical points.\n\nFor example, at ΔT=3, time t1+3:\n\nFor freeway 1: Span = [-47 +12*3, -36 +12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 included, so if on y=1, collision.\n\nBut we are on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: span [25+36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108,60+108]=[133,168], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt ΔT=5, time t1+5:\n\nFreeway 2: Span = [-41 +6*5, -30+6*5] = [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4,5.\n\nBut we are on y=8, freeway 8, span for k=8: [49+48*5, 96+48*5] = [49+240,96+240]=[289,336], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with sequence: all U for first 6 actions, S for last.\n\nBut actions: from turn t1 to t1+6.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: U\n\nTurn t1+2: U\n\nTurn t1+3: U\n\nTurn t1+4: U\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: S\n\nAfter a_{t1+5}=U at turn t1+5, y_{t1+6}=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+6, y=9, action a_{t1+6}=S, which keeps y_{t1+7}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we only output up to turn t1+6, since H=7 actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nPerhaps we can have a_{t1+6} not necessary, but we need to specify for all turns up to t1+6.\n\nSince we reach at turn t1+6, and action at that turn can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's fine.\n\nIs there a way with H=7 but different actions? But this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with H=7 but avoid some times, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at ΔT=5, if we were on y=6, it is safe, but in our path we are higher.\n\nBut no need.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the player starts at y=3, and we go directly up.\n\nBut let me see if at some point we need to stay to avoid, but in this case, no.\n\nFor example, at turn t1+3, ΔT=3, if we were on y=1, bad, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: S\n\nt1=87.\n\nActions: a_{87}, a_{88}, a_{89}, a_{90}, a_{91}, a_{92}, a_{93}\n\nAfter a_{92}, y_{93}=9? Let's list positions.\n\nTurn 87: y=3, action a_{87}=U, so y_{88}=4\n\nTurn 88: y=4, action a_{88}=U, y_{89}=5\n\nTurn 89: y=5, action a_{89}=U, y_{90}=6\n\nTurn 90: y=6, action a_{90}=U, y_{91}=7\n\nTurn 91: y=7, action a_{91}=U, y_{92}=8\n\nTurn 92: y=8, action a_{92}=U, y_{93}=9\n\nTurn 93: y=9, action a_{93}=S, y_{94}=9\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{93} for H=7? t1 + H -1 = 87 + 7 -1 = 93, yes y=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to 6, i.e., a_{87} to a_{93}.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{93} is S.\n\nWe could have a_{93} be U, but it stays at 9, same.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut is there any reason to not go up at some point? For example, if at some turn we are at dangerous y and time, but in this path, we never are.\n\nPerhaps at turn t1+2, ΔT=2, y=5, which is safe, but at ΔT=2, for y=5, span is [-29,-18], not covering 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal and safe.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on same freeway? No, each freeway has one car, I think.\n\nIn the table, for each k, one entry, so one car per freeway.\n\nk=2,3,4,5 all have cars, but different freeways.\n\nBut we handled.\n\nSo answer should be.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t1=87.\n\nMinimal H=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the action at turn 93 can be S or U, but since we are at 9, S is natural.\n\nIn the sequence, it must be specified.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: S\n\n}\n\nBut H=7, turns from 87 to 93, that's 7 turns.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 87 + 7 -1 = 93, yes.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence by going down and up, but that would increase H, since net up required.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=2 and up, more actions, H larger, not minimal.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nThus this should be it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 87\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\n### Dangerous Times and Freeways:\n- At \\(\\Delta T = 3\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 3 = 90\\)), only freeway \\(y = 1\\) is dangerous.\n- At \\(\\Delta T = 5\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 5 = 92\\)) and \\(\\Delta T = 6\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 6 = 93\\)), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are dangerous.\n- Freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are always safe, as the car spans never include 0.\n- Freeways \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are safe with no cars.\n\n### Path to Avoid Collisions:\n- Start at turn \\(t_1 = 87\\), \\(y = 3\\), which is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\).\n- Move up each turn to increase \\(y\\) as quickly as possible.\n- At turn 90 (\\(\\Delta T = 3\\)), the player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe (not \\(y = 1\\)).\n- At turns 92 and 93 (\\(\\Delta T = 5\\) and \\(\\Delta T = 6\\)), the player is at \\(y = 8\\) and \\(y = 9\\), respectively, avoiding dangerous freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n- The sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 93 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 87 + 7 - 1 = 93\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- All actions from turn 87 to turn 92 are \"U\" (up) to increase \\(y\\) from 3 to 9.\n- At turn 93, the position is \\(y = 9\\), so \"S\" (stay) is chosen to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 7\\) turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 87: U \\\\\nTurn 88: U \\\\\nTurn 89: U \\\\\nTurn 90: U \\\\\nTurn 91: U \\\\\nTurn 92: U \\\\\nTurn 93: S\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway at turn T has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at that exact turn T the player is still on y_T and will be subject to the car on freeway y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1} and will be subject to the car on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=90. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the leftmost part? Actually, the update rules clarify:\n\n- Left-moving: at turn t1, span is [h, τ] and then at turn T>t1, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: at turn t1, span is [τ, h] and then at turn T>t1, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the example for right-moving: initially [τ, h] meaning τ is the leftmost? Actually, for right-moving, the car moves to the right. So at t1, the tail is at τ and the head at h, and τ <= h. Then as time passes, both increase by s*(T-t1). Similarly, for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at τ, and h <= τ? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and we are told that the car moves left. So the entire car moves left.\n\nBut in the given data, for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12). This is a right-moving car. So at t1=90, the car is from 37 to 48? But the notation says \"head\" and \"tail\". For right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the leftmost? Because the update rule for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(dt), h + s*(dt)]. So in the state, they give (head, tail) and then the direction. So for a right-moving car, head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? But the update rule says: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\". So if the car is moving right, then at t1, the car occupies [τ, h] meaning from x=τ to x=h, and then at T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, they give (head, tail) and then the update: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(dt), τ - s*(dt)]. So for left-moving, head is the leftmost? Because the car moves left and the head is the leading part? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: the entire car shifts left. So if at t1 the car is from h to τ (with h <= τ) then at T it is from h-s*(dt) to τ-s*(dt).\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> so for right-moving: [τ, h] = [37,48] at t1=90? But wait, the update rule says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h] and then moves to [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So τ=37, h=48.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2,3,4,5: (-48,-59,right,6) -> so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Because τ is tail (leftmost) and h is head (rightmost). Then at t1, the car is from -59 to -48.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36) -> [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: (-48,-95,right,48) -> [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (which is y=k) and the car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn t1=90. We must reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nSince we are at y=0 at turn 90, we cannot go down (because y must be at least 0). We can only go up or stay.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway 0? Actually, the freeways are from 1 to 8. The player is at y=0 and y=9 are safe? Because the collision condition is for freeways y=1 to 8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nTherefore, the goal is to get to y=9 without being hit by cars on the freeways 1 to 8 during the turns we are on those freeways.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay) that moves us from y=0 to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nNote: we start at turn 90 at y=0. We can take actions at turns 90, 91, 92, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe position update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where\n    U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nConstraints: y must be in [0,9]. So if we are at y=0 and try to go down, we stay at 0? But the problem says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So if we are at 0 and choose D, we go to max(0, 0-1)=0. Similarly at 9 and U: min(9,9+1)=9.\n\nBut note: we are starting at (0,0) at turn 90. We are not on a freeway (since freeways are 1 to 8) so we are safe at turn 90.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H. The minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we must avoid the cars. So we might have to wait (stay) or even go down sometimes? But going down from y=0 doesn't change, and going down from higher freeways might be necessary to avoid a car.\n\nBut note: we are at y=0 at turn 90. We can only go up to y=1 at turn 91, then to y=2 at turn 92, etc. So the minimal is 9 moves of U, but we have to check at each step when we are at freeway k (for k=1,2,...,8) at turn T, that the car on freeway k at turn T does not cover x=0.\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=90) the position of the car on that freeway.\n\nGiven that each freeway has only one car? The table lists one car per freeway. So each freeway has one car.\n\nSo for freeway k, we have the car state at t1=90: (head, tail, direction, speed). Since all are right-moving, we can compute the span at any turn T as:\n\n  τ0 = tail (given as the tail at t1)\n  h0 = head (given as the head at t1)\n\nThen at turn T (relative to t1=90, let dt = T - 90), the car moves right by s * dt.\n\nSo the span at turn T: [ τ0 + s*dt, h0 + s*dt ]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if the player is at (0, k) and:\n\n  0 is in [ τ0 + s*dt, h0 + s*dt ]\n\ni.e., τ0 + s*dt <= 0 <= h0 + s*dt\n\nWe can rearrange:\n\n  -h0 <= s*dt <= -τ0   [but note: since τ0 <= h0, and s>0, we have]\n\nActually: \n  τ0 + s*dt <= 0 <= h0 + s*dt\n  => s*dt <= -τ0   and  s*dt >= -h0   [if we move the constants]\n\nBut note: because the car is moving right, and τ0 is the left end and h0 the right end, so we require:\n\n  left_end = τ0 + s*dt <= 0 <= right_end = h0 + s*dt\n\nWe can compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=90) the condition for collision.\n\nBut note: we only care about the turns when the player is on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's movement. We start at y=0 at turn 90. We are not on a freeway at turn 90 (since freeways are 1..8), so safe.\n\nThen at turn 91, we will be at y1 = 0 or 1? Depending on the action at turn 90.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can try to go as fast as possible: 9 consecutive U moves. Then we would be at:\n\nTurn 90: at (0,0) -> safe (not on freeway)\nTurn 91: at (0,1) -> then we are on freeway 1 at turn 91.\nTurn 92: at (0,2)\n...\nTurn 98: at (0,8) -> freeway 8 at turn 98.\nTurn 99: at (0,9) -> goal.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway k at turn (90+k) for k=1 to 8? Actually, when we are at freeway k, the turn is when we are at that freeway: for freeway 1 at turn 91, freeway 2 at turn 92, ... freeway 8 at turn 98.\n\nSo we check for each k from 1 to 8, at turn T = 90 + k, the car on freeway k.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway k the condition at turn T = 90 + k:\n\ndt = T - 90 = k.\n\nSo for freeway k, at turn 90+k, dt = k.\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in the span of the car on freeway k at that turn.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1, car: (head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12)\n  dt=1\n  left_end = 37 + 12*1 = 49\n  right_end = 48 + 12*1 = 60\n  So the car is from 49 to 60. 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 2: k=2, car: (head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=6) -> note: tail=-59, head=-48? But wait: in the table, for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). How do we interpret?\n\nThe problem says: for right-moving, at t1 the span is [τ, h] = [tail, head]. So τ = -59, h = -48? Then at turn T, the span is [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-59 + 6*dt, -48 + 6*dt]\n\nAt turn T=90+2=92, dt=2:\n  left_end = -59 + 6*2 = -59+12 = -47\n  right_end = -48 + 12 = -36\n  So the car is from -47 to -36. 0 is not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? The table says: freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> same as freeway 2. So at T=90+3=93, dt=3:\n  left_end = -59 + 6*3 = -59+18 = -41\n  right_end = -48 + 18 = -30\n  0 not in [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, at T=94, dt=4:\n  left_end = -59+24 = -35\n  right_end = -48+24 = -24 -> safe.\n\nFreeway 5: at T=95, dt=5:\n  left_end = -59+30 = -29\n  right_end = -48+30 = -18 -> safe.\n\nFreeway 6: (head=-48, tail=-83, right, speed=36)\n  At T=96, dt=6:\n  left_end = -83 + 36*6 = -83 + 216 = 133\n  right_end = -48 + 216 = 168\n  So the car is from 133 to 168 -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nFreeway 7: (head=-48, tail=-95, right, speed=48)\n  At T=97, dt=7:\n  left_end = -95 + 48*7 = -95 + 336 = 241\n  right_end = -48 + 336 = 288 -> safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? At T=98, dt=8:\n  left_end = -95 + 48*8 = -95 + 384 = 289\n  right_end = -48 + 384 = 336 -> safe.\n\nSo if we go straight up 9 times (from turn90 to turn98: 9 actions, but note: at turn90 we start at y0=0. Then:\n\nTurn90: U -> at turn91: y=1\nTurn91: U -> at turn92: y=2\n...\nTurn97: U -> at turn98: y=8\nTurn98: U -> at turn99: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn99. So the last action is at turn98, and we reach y=9 at turn99. Therefore, H=9? The number of actions is 9? But the sequence is from t=90 to t=90+8? Because we have 9 actions: a90 to a98.\n\nThe problem: we are to output for turns starting at t1=90 and then t1+1, ... until the last action. The minimal H is the number of turns we take actions? Or the number of turns until we reach? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that we reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: at turn t1 (90) we start. Then we take an action at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we are at a new state. We take actions until we reach the goal at turn t1+H-1? Or the goal is reached at the end of the last action?\n\nActually, the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1: meaning we take H actions, and the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t1 (t=0 in the sequence index), we take action a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1 we have y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nThen at the end of H actions, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nLet me read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo we require that at the turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut note: when we take an action at turn t, it affects the position at turn t+1. \n\nSo if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then at turn t1+H-1 (before the action) we are at some position, and then after the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis implies that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or at the end? \n\nThe collision condition is at the turn: when the player is on a freeway at turn T, we check the car at turn T. So the position at turn T is the one we care about for collision and for the goal.\n\nThe goal is to have the player at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we must have the player at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or at the end? \n\nActually, the state at turn T is the position at the start of the turn? Then we take an action and move to the next state.\n\nBut the problem does not specify exactly. However, the collision condition says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". This suggests that at the start of turn T, the player is at y_T and then we check the car for that freeway at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, the goal is at turn t1+H-1: we must be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) and then we don't take any action? Because the sequence has H actions, so the last action is at turn t1+H-2? \n\nLet me re-index:\n\nLet T0 = t1 = 90.\n\nWe take actions at T0, T0+1, ..., T0+H-1 (total H actions).\n\nThen the state at T0 is given (initial state).\n\nAfter action at T0, we get state at T0+1.\n\nAfter action at T0+H-1, we get state at T0+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is T0+H-1) we are at (0,9).\n\nThis means that the state at the beginning of turn T0+H-1 is (0,9)? But then we would take an action at turn T0+H-1? But the sequence of actions goes up to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{T0+H-1}. \n\nBut if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T0+H-1, then we don't need to take an action? However, the sequence includes an action for turn T0+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T0+H-1, then we can take an action (but it won't change the position because at y=9, U does nothing) but that would be one extra action.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and we are to have the state at turn t1+H-1 be (0,9). \n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to do anything? But the sequence must include H actions. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the answer format: we output actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action. So if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then the last action we took was at turn t1+H-2? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, meaning t from 0 to H-1: so the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state at turn t1+H (after the last action) is y_{t1+H}. But the goal is at turn t1+H-1? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut when we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, it will update the state to turn t1+H. So the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action to get to turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have already been at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action (which might be S, U, or D) but if we are at 9, U and S will leave us at 9? But then we are at 9 at turn t1+H as well. \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we can take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action doesn't change the position? \n\nHowever, note that we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. So if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we are safe (since freeways are 1-8). Then at turn t1+H-1 we can take any action? But we don't care about the next state because we are done at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions at every turn. So if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we are safe. The action we take at turn t1+H-1 doesn't matter for collision? Because after the action we move to turn t1+H, but we don't require to be safe at turn t1+H? Because the goal is already achieved at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is checked at every turn T for the state at the beginning of the turn. So at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) and safe. Then we take an action, which might move us to (0,9) again (if we do S or U) or to (0,8) (if we do D) but we don't care about the next state because the goal is achieved at turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: we must avoid collisions at every turn. And the goal is at turn t1+H-1. So the actions we take at turn t1+H-1 doesn't affect the safety at turn t1+H-1? Because the state at turn t1+H-1 is already (0,9) and safe. And the action only affects the next state.\n\nTherefore, we can take any action at turn t1+H-1? But to minimize H, we want to achieve the goal as soon as possible. So we want the smallest H such that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the straight-up plan, we would be:\n\nTurn90: at (0,0) -> safe (not freeway)\nAction at turn90: U -> then at turn91: (0,1)\n\nTurn91: at (0,1) -> freeway1 -> check car: we did, safe.\nAction at turn91: U -> turn92: (0,2)\n\n...\n\nTurn97: at (0,7) -> freeway7: at turn97, dt=7? Actually, for freeway7 we check at turn97: \n  freeway7 car: (head=-48, tail=-95, right,48) at dt=97-90=7 -> as above: [ -95+48*7, -48+48*7] = [241, 288] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn98: (0,8)\n\nTurn98: at (0,8) -> freeway8: at turn98, dt=8: [ -95+48*8, -48+48*8] = [289, 336] -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn99: (0,9)\n\nBut we are at (0,9) at turn99. So we require to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So turn99 = 90+H-1 => 99 = 90+H-1 => H=10.\n\nBut we can be at (0,9) at an earlier turn? How?\n\nAlternatively, we can be at (0,9) at turn98? That would require that at the beginning of turn98 we are at (0,9). But how?\n\nWe started at turn90 at (0,0). To be at (0,9) at turn98, we must have taken 8 actions? But 8 moves of U would get us to (0,8) at turn98? \n\nLet me see:\n\nTurn90: start at (0,0)\nAfter action at turn90: we go to (0,1) at turn91.\n...\nAfter action at turn97: we go to (0,8) at turn98.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn98, we are at (0,8). Then we take an action at turn98 to go to (0,9) at turn99.\n\nSo we cannot be at (0,9) at turn98? \n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at (0,9) is turn99. So H-1 must be 99? Then H=10.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And the sequence has H actions: from turn90 to turn90+H-1.\n\nSo if we take 10 actions, then the last action is at turn99? And we are at (0,9) at turn100? But we require to be at (0,9) at turn99? \n\nWe are confused.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- At the start of turn t1 (90): position is (0,0).\n- We take action a90, then at the start of turn91, we are at y91 = y90 + Δy90.\n\nSo the position at the start of turn T is the result of the action taken at turn T-1.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at the start of turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moves us to y=9.\n\nThe minimal T for which we are at (0,9) is T = 90 + 9 = 99? Because we need 9 up moves.\n\nThen we are at (0,9) at the start of turn99.\n\nTherefore, we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 90+H-1 = 99? So 90+H-1=99 => H=10.\n\nAnd we take 10 actions: from turn90 to turn99? But the last action (at turn99) is taken when we are at (0,9) at the start of turn99, and then we move to (0,9) again? But we don't need to move.\n\nBut the sequence must have H=10 actions. However, we only need 9 actions: actions at turn90 to turn98.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so if H=10, then we have 10 actions: a90 to a99.\n\nBut at turn99, we are already at (0,9) at the start, so we can take action S, U, or D? But we are done at the start of turn99? \n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, and we do not take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes actions up to turn t1+H-1.\n\nI think there is a standard interpretation: the state at time t is after the action at time t-1. The goal is to be at (0,9) at time t1+H-1, and we take actions from time t1 to time t1+H-2? But the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nTo resolve, let's look at the example: if we start at (0,0) and take 9 actions of U, then:\n\nAfter action0 (turn90): at turn91: y=1\n...\nAfter action8 (turn98): at turn99: y=9.\n\nSo at turn99, we are at (0,9). So we require t1+H-1 = 99. Since t1=90, then 90+H-1=99 -> H=10.\n\nBut we only took 9 actions? The sequence should be 9 actions? But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nTherefore, we must have 10 actions? But the 10th action is redundant.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". So H=10? And we take 10 actions? But the last action doesn't change anything.\n\nHowever, we can avoid the last action by being at (0,9) at turn98? But we saw that we cannot be at (0,9) at turn98 because we start at turn90 and need 9 moves.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=10, and we take 10 actions. But the last action at turn99 is not necessary for moving but we have to output it.\n\nBut we can do: at turn99, we are at (0,9) and we can do S.\n\nNow, in our straight-up plan, we saw that all freeways are safe at the turns we pass. So we can do:\n\nTurn90: U -> to y1 at turn91\nTurn91: U -> to y2 at turn92\n...\nTurn98: U -> to y9 at turn99\n\nThen at turn99, we are at (0,9). But we need to take an action at turn99? Because the sequence must include H=10 actions. So we take an action at turn99, which can be S.\n\nSo the sequence is 9 U's and one S at the end? But we are at (0,9) at turn99 (the start) and then we do S and then at turn100 we are still at (0,9). But we are to reach at turn t1+H-1 = 90+10-1=99. So we are there at turn99 (start) and then we take an action.\n\nBut the goal is achieved at the start of turn99, so we don't care about the action at turn99.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and the sequence is 9 U's and then one S (or any action) at the last step.\n\nBut we can also do 10 U's: the last U at turn99 would leave us at (0,9) at turn100, but we are to be at (0,9) at turn99? Then that doesn't work.\n\nWe must be at (0,9) at the start of turn99. So the last action that moves us to 9 must be at turn98. Then at turn99, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at turn99, which we can choose S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U\nTurn91: U\n...\nTurn98: U -> this gets us to (0,9) at turn99.\nTurn99: S\n\nTotal 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to get there in fewer turns? For example, H=9? Then we require to be at (0,9) at turn90+9-1=98.\n\nAt turn98, we must be at (0,9). How to get to (0,9) by turn98? We start at (0,0) at turn90. So we need to cover 9 units in 8 moves? That is impossible because the maximum we can do is 8 moves of U: at turn98 we would be at (0,8).\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut wait, we can move faster? We can only move one step per turn. So yes, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car movements: in our straight-up plan, we are safe at every freeway. So we can do 9 U's and then one S.\n\nBut the problem says: avoid collisions at every turn. We are safe at the freeways we pass because we checked.\n\nBut note: at turn99, we are at (0,9) and safe. Then we do S at turn99: that doesn't move us, so we are still at (0,9) at turn100? But we don't care about turn100.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn90: U\nTurn91: U\nTurn92: U\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\nTurn99: S\n\nBut we can do S at turn99? Or we can do U? But if we do U at turn99, we stay at 9. So same.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we stop? It just requires we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1=99. And we are there at the start of turn99. Then we take an action at turn99, which can be anything.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do S.\n\nBut wait: is there a car at freeway9? No, freeways are 1-8. So y=9 is safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut the problem says: the player is at (0,0) at turn90. Then we take action at turn90: U -> then at turn91 we are at (0,1). Then we check: at turn91, we are on freeway1. We computed the car on freeway1 at turn91: [37+12*(1), 48+12*(1)] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut wait, freeway1 car: at turn91, dt=1: [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway2 at turn92: car state: tail=-59, head=-48, speed=6, dt=2: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nBut freeway6: at turn96, dt=6: car: tail=-83, head=-48, speed=36: [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe.\n\nSo the straight-up plan works.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and the sequence is 9 U's and one S at the end.\n\nBut we can also do 10 U's? Then the last U at turn99 would leave us at (0,9) at turn100? But we are required to be at (0,9) at turn99 (the start of turn99). So if we do U at turn99, we are at (0,9) at turn100. But we are not at (0,9) at turn99? Then we fail.\n\nTherefore, we must have reached (0,9) at the start of turn99. So the action at turn98 must be U (to get from y=8 to y=9). Then at turn99, we are at (0,9). Then the action at turn99 can be S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U\nTurn91: U\nTurn92: U\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U   -> this brings us to (0,9) at turn99.\nTurn99: S\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: S\n}\n\nBut is there a possibility to do it in H=9? We argued no, because we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9, and then we need to be at turn99, which requires H=10.\n\nBut wait, the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. For H=9, we would require to be at (0,9) at turn90+9-1=98. But we can only be at (0,8) at turn98 at best. So impossible.\n\nHence, H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut just to be sure, is there a way to use down moves to avoid a car and then go up faster? But we are already moving as fast as possible. And we don't need to avoid any car in this case.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the car at freeway1 at turn91: \n  freeway1: (48,37,right,12) at t1=90.\n  At turn91: dt=1 -> [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> 0 not in there? Correct.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn98: \n  freeway8: (-48,-95,right,48) -> [ -95 + 48*8, -48 + 48*8] = [-95+384, -48+384] = [289, 336] -> 0 not in there.\n\nAll others are safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut note: freeway 2,3,4,5 are all the same: (-48,-59,right,6). So for freeway2 at turn92: dt=2 -> [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 9 U's and then one S.\n\nBut we can also do the last action as U? Then at turn99, we do U: but we are at y=9, so we stay at 9. Then at turn100 we are still at 9. But we are required to be at (0,9) at turn99 (which we are). So it is safe.\n\nBut to be consistent, we can do S.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify which action to choose when multiple are possible. Since we are already at 9, we can do S.\n\nSo I will output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: S\n}\n\nBut wait: the sequence must have exactly H=10 actions, and we have 10 lines.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to 9 (if H=10). So t=0: turn90, t=1: turn91, ... t=9: turn99.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) at turn 99 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 90 + H - 1 = 99\\) implies \\(H = 10\\)) with the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe player starts at (0, 0) at turn 90. Moving up (U) increases the y-coordinate by 1, moving down (D) decreases it by 1, and staying (S) keeps it the same, with the position clamped between 0 and 9. The minimal path requires moving up 9 times to reach y = 9, which takes 9 actions (from turn 90 to turn 98). However, \\(H = 10\\) is required to satisfy the condition that the player is at (0, 9) at turn 99. Thus, an additional action (S) is taken at turn 99 to complete the sequence without changing the position.\n\nCollision checks for each freeway at the relevant turns (when the player is on that freeway) confirm safety:\n- **Freeway 1 at turn 91**: Car span is \\([37 + 12 \\times (91-90), 48 + 12 \\times (91-90)] = [49, 60]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Freeway 2 at turn 92**: Car span is \\([-59 + 6 \\times (92-90), -48 + 6 \\times (92-90)] = [-47, -36]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Freeway 3 at turn 93**: Car span is \\([-59 + 6 \\times (93-90), -48 + 6 \\times (93-90)] = [-41, -30]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Freeway 4 at turn 94**: Car span is \\([-59 + 6 \\times (94-90), -48 + 6 \\times (94-90)] = [-35, -24]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Freeway 5 at turn 95**: Car span is \\([-59 + 6 \\times (95-90), -48 + 6 \\times (95-90)] = [-29, -18]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Freeway 6 at turn 96**: Car span is \\([-83 + 36 \\times (96-90), -48 + 36 \\times (96-90)] = [133, 168]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Freeway 7 at turn 97**: Car span is \\([-95 + 48 \\times (97-90), -48 + 48 \\times (97-90)] = [241, 288]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Freeway 8 at turn 98**: Car span is \\([-95 + 48 \\times (98-90), -48 + 48 \\times (98-90)] = [289, 336]\\), 0 not in span.\n\nThe sequence of 9 U actions followed by 1 S action ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 99 safely and minimizes \\(H\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: S\n}",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is the freeway index) at that turn and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at that exact turn.\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is on y and will be checked against the car on freeway y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y' and will be checked against the car on freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (93). We can compute the car's position at any future turn T (>=93) by:\n\nFor a car on freeway i with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s) at turn t1:\n  If d is right: \n      At turn T, the car's head = h + s*(T - t1)\n      tail = tau + s*(T - t1)\n      So the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (since head > tail for right-moving? Actually, note the given: for right-moving, at t1 the span is [tau, h] meaning h is the head and tau is the tail? But in the example for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\". So the car moves right.\n\n  If d is left:\n      head = h - s*(T-t1)\n      tail = tau - s*(T-t1)\n      span = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving, at t1: [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But note: the head and tail might be in decreasing order? However, the representation is such that the head is always the leading part? Actually, the problem states for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the head h is the rightmost? But then when moving left, the head decreases.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that 0 must be in the span at turn T.\n\nWe have to avoid being on a freeway y at turn T when the car on that freeway (freeway y) has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at y=3 at turn 93. We can move U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), or S (stay: same y). The y must be in [0,9]. The goal is y=9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 93 to turn 93+H-1 such that at turn 93+H-1, y=9.\n\nNote: the actions are taken at each turn from t=93 to t=93+H-1 (so H actions) and the position at turn 93+H-1 is after the last action.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from 93 to 93+H-1.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at future turns. We note that the cars are only on freeways 1 to 8. We don't care about freeway 0 or 9? Actually, the player can be on freeway 0 or 9 and there are no cars there? The problem states cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So if the player is on y=0 or y=9, there is no car to collide with.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9) which is freeway 9. So once we get to y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 93.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (1 to 8) the times when the car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nFor a car on freeway i with (h, tau, d, s) at turn 93 (t1=93):\n\nCase 1: right-moving (d='right')\n  Span at turn T: [tau + s*(T-93), h + s*(T-93)]\n  We require that 0 is in [A, B] where A = tau + s*(T-93), B = h + s*(T-93)\n  => A <= 0 <= B.\n\nCase 2: left-moving (d='left')\n  Span at turn T: [h - s*(T-93), tau - s*(T-93)]   [Note: the representation at t1 is [h, tau] but then becomes [h - s*(T-93), tau - s*(T-93)]? Actually, the problem says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-93), tau - s*(T-93)]\". However, note that for a left-moving car, the head is at the leftmost? Actually, the head is the leading part. When moving left, the head is decreasing. So the span is [head, tail] but in decreasing order? The problem does not specify the order. But note: the representation for left at t1: [h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-93), tau - s*(T-93)]. Since the car moves left, the entire segment shifts left. However, we need to know: is h the leftmost or the rightmost?\n\nLooking at the update: for left, the head becomes h - s*(T-93) and tail becomes tau - s*(T-93). The span is written as [head, tail] at t1, and then at T as [head - ..., tail - ...]. But note: if at t1 the head is at a greater position than the tail? Actually, no: when moving left, the head is the front, which is the leftmost? Actually, the problem states for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-93), tau - s*(T-93)]. And for collision we require 0 in [h - s*(T-93), tau - s*(T-93)]. But if h < tau? Then the interval [h, tau] is increasing? But for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem does not specify. However, note the example for right: the representation at t1 is [tau, h] meaning tau is the tail and h is the head? So for right, the tail is the leftmost and the head is the rightmost? Similarly, for left, the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost? Then the span for left is [head, tail] and since head is leftmost, head <= tail? Then the interval [head, tail] is increasing? But then when moving left, the entire segment moves left, so the head becomes head - s*(T-93) and tail becomes tail - s*(T-93). Then the interval becomes [head - s*(T-93), tail - s*(T-93)].\n\nSo for a left-moving car, the condition for 0 to be in the span is:\n  head - s*(T-93) <= 0 <= tail - s*(T-93)\n\nBut note: if the car is long, then the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost, so the entire car is from head to tail (with head <= tail). Then the condition is:\n  head - s*(T-93) <= 0 <= tail - s*(T-93)\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving:\n  tau + s*(T-93) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-93)\n\nNow, let's list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> right-moving: tail=-47, head=-36, speed=12\n  Condition: -47 + 12*(T-93) <= 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-93)\n\n  Solve:\n    -47 + 12*(T-93) <= 0  => 12*(T-93) <= 47 => T-93 <= 47/12 = 3.9167 => T <= 96.9167 -> T <= 96 (if integer turns, and T is integer)\n    and 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-93) => 12*(T-93) >= 36 => T-93 >= 3 => T>=96.\n\n  So T=96: \n      lower bound: -47 + 12*3 = -47+36 = -11 <= 0\n      upper bound: -36 + 12*3 = -36+36 = 0 <= 0 -> yes, 0 is in [-11,0] -> so at T=96, freeway1 is dangerous.\n\n  Also T=97? \n      lower: -47+12*4 = -47+48=1 -> 1<=0 false -> so not.\n\n  So freeway1: only at T=96.\n\nFreeway2: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> tail=-41, head=-30, speed=6\n  Condition: -41 + 6*(T-93) <= 0 <= -30 + 6*(T-93)\n\n  Lower: -41+6k <=0 -> 6k<=41 -> k<=41/6≈6.833 -> k<=6\n  Upper: 0<= -30+6k -> 6k>=30 -> k>=5\n  So k=5,6 -> T=93+5=98? Wait: k = T-93 -> so T-93 in [5,6] -> T=98 and 99.\n\n  Check T=98: \n      lower: -41+6*5 = -41+30 = -11 <=0\n      upper: -30+6*5 = -30+30=0 -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> dangerous at T=98.\n  T=99:\n      lower: -41+6*6 = -41+36=-5<=0\n      upper: -30+6*6=-30+36=6>=0 -> dangerous at T=99.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2? (-30,-41,right,6) -> same as freeway2: dangerous at T=98,99.\n\nFreeway4: same -> dangerous at T=98,99.\n\nFreeway5: same -> dangerous at T=98,99.\n\nFreeway6: (60,25,right,36) -> tail=25, head=60, speed=36 -> note: the representation for right is [tail, head]? But wait: the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\". So tau=25, h=60? Then condition: 25+36*(T-93) <= 0 <= 60+36*(T-93)\n\nBut 25+36k <=0 -> 36k<=-25 -> k<=-25/36 -> negative? So no solution? Also 0<=60+36k -> k>=-60/36≈-1.66 -> so k>=-1.66. But k>=0? So the condition is never satisfied? Let me check:\n\nWe require 25+36k <=0 and 0<=60+36k. The first inequality: 25+36k<=0 -> k<=-25/36 which is negative. But k=T-93>=0. So no solution. So freeway6 is never at 0? Actually, the car is at [25,60] at turn 93 and moving right. Since 25>0, and it moves away to the right, so 0 is never in the span? Correct.\n\nFreeway7: (96,49,right,48) -> tail=49, head=96, speed=48\n  Condition: 49+48k <=0<=96+48k -> \n    49+48k<=0 -> k<=-49/48 -> negative -> no solution? \n    and 0<=96+48k -> k>=-96/48=-2. So k>=0 satisfies the second, but the first is never satisfied for k>=0. So safe.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7: safe.\n\nSo the dangerous freeways and times:\n\nFreeway1: T=96\nFreeway2: T=98,99\nFreeway3: T=98,99\nFreeway4: T=98,99\nFreeway5: T=98,99\n\nWe are at turn 93 at y=3.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of moves? Without any cars, we could go up 6 times: UUUUUU -> 6 turns. But we must avoid the dangerous times and positions.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway at a dangerous time for that freeway.\n\nSpecifically:\n- At T=96, we must not be on freeway1.\n- At T=98 and 99, we must not be on freeways 2,3,4,5.\n\nNote: if we are on freeway0 or freeway9, we are safe (no cars).\n\nPlan:\n\nWe start at turn93: y=3.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nWe can try to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid:\n\n- At T=96 (which is 3 turns from now: turns 93,94,95 -> then at turn96 we are at the position after 3 actions) we must not be on freeway1.\n\nWhat is our position at turn96?\n\nTurn93: start at y=3.\nAfter turn93 (action a93): at turn94 we are at y93 + delta(a93)\nSimilarly, at turn94: we do a94 -> at turn95: y95 = y94 + delta(a94)\nAt turn95: we do a95 -> at turn96: y96 = y95 + delta(a95)\n\nSo at turn96, we are at y96.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway1 at turn96, so y96 != 1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn98 and 99, we must avoid being on freeways 2,3,4,5. So at turn98: y98 should not be in {2,3,4,5}; at turn99: y99 should not be in {2,3,4,5}.\n\nWe want to reach y=9. The minimal H is at least 6 (if we go up every time).\n\nLet me denote the turns:\n\nTurn: 93 -> position: y93 = 3\nTurn: 94 -> y94 = 3 + d93 (d93 in { -1,0,1 } but note we can only go to [0,9])\nTurn: 95 -> y95 = y94 + d94\nTurn: 96 -> y96 = y95 + d95\nTurn: 97 -> y97 = y96 + d96\nTurn: 98 -> y98 = y97 + d97\nTurn: 99 -> y99 = y98 + d98\n...\n\nWe require that at turn96: y96 != 1.\n\nAt turn98: y98 not in {2,3,4,5}\nAt turn99: y99 not in {2,3,4,5}\n\nAnd we must be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that at turn93+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet me try H=6: we want to be at y=9 at turn98 (because turn93+5: that would be after 6 actions? Let me index:\n\nActions: at turns 93,94,95,96,97,98 -> that's 6 actions -> then at turn98 (after the 6th action) we are at y98.\n\nBut we require y98=9. And we must avoid at turn98: if we are at y98=9, then we are safe because 9 is not in {2,3,4,5}. Similarly, at turn99 we are not required to be at 9? But we are done at turn98? Actually, the goal is reached at turn98? Then we don't care about turn99.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn93+H-1. So if H=6, then we are at turn93+5 = 98? Actually: \n  t=93: we do a93 -> then at turn94 we have the new position.\n  ...\n  t=93+H-1: we do the last action, and then we are at the position at turn93+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1: so we do actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the position after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". Wait, that might be a typo? Let me check:\n\nThe player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo if we do an action at time t, then the next state y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nAt turn t1 (93), we start at y_{93}=3.\n\nAfter action a93 at turn93, we get y94 = y93 + Δy93.\n\nThen at turn94, we do a94, and get y95 = y94 + Δy94, etc.\n\nWe want at turn t1+H-1? But note the index: \n\nThe sequence of actions: from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions). Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and it produces the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". That is, the position at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\nBut according to the update, the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state before the action at t1+H-1? Actually, no: the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t. Then we do an action at turn t, and then we get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo the state at turn t1 is given. After action at t1, we get state at t1+1. Then at the end of the sequence of H actions, we have the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". This seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem: \n  \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at times: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. The state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But the problem says we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That would be the state before the last action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there might be an indexing issue. Let me reread:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ... until the last action.\n\nBut the state at which we are at (0,9) must be after the last action? That would be turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait, note the problem says: \"the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so t from 0 to H-1: that's H actions. Then the state after the last action is at time t1+H. But the problem says we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThis suggests that the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). But that would be before the action at turn t1+H-1. How do we get to that state? By the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? Then why do we have an action at t1+H-1?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. But then why does it say y_{t1+H-1}=9?\n\nLet me check the update: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo the state at time t+1 is determined by the state at time t and the action at time t.\n\nTherefore, the state at time t1 is given. Then:\n\nAt time t1: we take action a_{t1} -> then state at t1+1 = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n...\nAt time t1+H-1: we take action a_{t1+H-1} -> then state at t1+H = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe want the state at time t1+H to be 9? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there is a confusion. Let me see the example in the problem? There is none.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we have to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But then we would move away? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal H is the number of actions to get to (0,9) at the state after the last action, which is turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nI will assume that the problem means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). Then we do not need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, which includes an action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo. But to be safe, let's read carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so the last action is at t1+H-1.\n\nAnd \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" -> the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9? Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, which would change the state. So we would not be at 9 after that action? That doesn't make sense for the goal.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. But then why write y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nI see: the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we take an action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}. So to have y_{t} = 9 for some t, we don't need an action at that turn? But the problem requires a sequence of actions for H turns.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we do H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1) and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at (0,9). But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLooking again: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So it requires the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9. But then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H} which might not be 9.\n\nThat seems odd. \n\nBut note the goal is to be at (0,9). It doesn't specify if it's at the beginning or after an action. However, the collision condition is checked at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And y_T is the freeway at turn T, which is the state at the beginning of turn T.\n\nSo we are concerned with the state at the beginning of each turn.\n\nThe goal is to have the state at the beginning of some turn be (0,9).\n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we take an action at turn t1+H-1, which might move us, but we don't care as long as at the beginning of that turn we are at 9? \n\nBut then after the action we might be at 8 or 10? and 10 is invalid? \n\nThe problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9. It says \"reach (0,9)\". So being at 9 at the beginning of a turn is reaching.\n\nAnd then we take an action? But the action might move us away. That doesn't matter because we've reached at that turn.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"a sequence of actions of H turns\", meaning we take H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we have reached at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut wait: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9? Then we did not need the action at turn t1+H-1 to get there. We got there by the previous actions.\n\nSo the actions from t1 to t1+H-2 would have brought us to y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at 9. \n\nBut then we must not collide at turn t1+H-1: meaning we must not be on a freeway that has a car at 0 at turn t1+H-1. But at y=9, there is no car, so it's safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is the number of actions to get to y=9 at the beginning of a turn, and then we take one more action? But the problem requires the sequence of actions to be of length H, and the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nThat means we do actions at turns: 93, 94, ..., 93+H-1, and at the beginning of turn 93+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nHow did we get to y=9 at turn93+H-1? \n  The actions at turns 93 to 93+H-2 determine the state at 93+H-1.\n\nSo we have H-1 actions to move from y=3 (at turn93) to y=9 (at turn93+H-1). \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of actions (H) to get from y=3 to y=9 is at least 6? Because we need to move up 6 times. But then:\n\n  We start at turn93: y93=3.\n  After action a93 (at turn93): we get y94 = 3 + d93.\n  ...\n  After action a_{93+H-2} (at turn93+H-2): we get y_{93+H-1} = ... = 9.\n\nSo we have H-1 actions to move from 3 to 9: so we need at least 6 moves (each move can be up, down, or stay). The minimal number of moves (actions) to go from 3 to 9 is 6 (if we go up 6 times). So H-1 = 6 -> H=7.\n\nBut then the sequence has 7 actions: at turns 93 to 99. And at turn93+7-1 = turn99, we are at y99=9.\n\nBut we also have to avoid collisions at every turn from 93 to 99.\n\nAlternatively, we might take more actions to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nBut first, let's list the dangerous turns for the freeways:\n\nTurn96: freeway1 is dangerous -> so we must not be on freeway1 at the beginning of turn96.\n\nTurn98: freeways2,3,4,5 dangerous -> not on 2,3,4,5 at turn98.\nTurn99: freeways2,3,4,5 dangerous -> not on 2,3,4,5 at turn99.\n\nNow, we are at turn93: y=3.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t (for some t) and we need to choose a path with minimal H such that the state at turn93+H-1 is 9.\n\nAnd we must avoid collisions at every turn from 93 to 93+H-1.\n\nThe turns we are concerned with: 93,94,95,96,97,98,99,... until the turn we reach.\n\nLet me try H=7: then we want to be at y=9 at turn93+7-1 = 99.\n\nSo we start at turn93: y93=3.\n\nWe take 6 actions (from 93 to 98) to get to y99=9? Actually, no: \n\nThe state at turn93: y93=3.\nThen we take action at turn93: then state at turn94 = 3 + d93.\n...\nAction at turn98: then state at turn99 = y98 + d98.\n\nWe require y99=9.\n\nBut we also require that at the beginning of turn99, we are at y99=9. So we don't need an action after that? But the sequence includes an action at turn99? No, the last action is at turn93+H-1 = 93+7-1=99. But then the state at turn99 is already 9 at the beginning? Then the action at turn99 would change it. \n\nBut the problem says the state at turn93+H-1 (which is turn99) is 9, meaning at the beginning of turn99 we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn99, which might change the state. But the goal is already met at the beginning of turn99. \n\nHowever, we must also check collision at turn99: we are at y99=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the actions from turn93 to turn98 (6 actions) must bring us to y99=9? But the state at turn99 is determined by the action at turn98: \n  y99 = y98 + d98.\n\nSo we require: y98 + d98 = 9.\n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn99 is y99=9, so we are safe at turn99.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nWe have 6 actions (at turns93 to 98) to move from y93=3 to y99=9.\n\nThe net movement: we need to move up by 6.\n\nEach action: U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo we need at least 6 U's.\n\nBut we can also go down and then up? But that would take more moves. So minimal is 6 U's.\n\nBut we have 6 actions: so we must do U every time.\n\nLet me simulate:\n\nTurn93: start at y93=3.\nAction93: U -> y94=4\nTurn94: at y94=4 -> action94: U -> y95=5\nTurn95: at y95=5 -> action95: U -> y96=6\nTurn96: at y96=6 -> action96: U -> y97=7\nTurn97: at y97=7 -> action97: U -> y98=8\nTurn98: at y98=8 -> action98: U -> y99=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn99, we are at y99=9 -> goal reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn from 93 to 98, we are at:\n\nTurn93: y93=3 -> freeway3: at turn93, is freeway3 dangerous? We computed dangerous turns for freeway3: T=98,99. So at turn93, freeway3 is safe? How do we check?\n\nWe must check for each turn T from 93 to 98, and for the freeway y_T at that turn, whether the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe have the car states at turn93. We computed for freeway3: dangerous at T=98 and 99.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn93: y93=3 -> freeway3: at turn93, is 0 in the car's span? \n  Freeway3: at turn93: the car is at [-41, -30]? (since it's right-moving: tail=-41, head=-30, so the span is [-41,-30] at turn93? \n  But 0 is not in [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nTurn94: y94=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway2,3,4,5? Freeway4: (-30,-41,right,6) -> at turn94: \n  k = 94-93=1\n  span = [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn95: y95=5 -> freeway5: \n  k=2: span = [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nTurn96: y96=6 -> freeway6: we know safe at all times? \n  But we must check: freeway6: (60,25,right,36) -> at turn96: k=3\n  span = [25+36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108, 60+108] = [133,168] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn97: y97=7 -> freeway7: (96,49,right,48) -> at turn97: k=4\n  span = [49+48*4, 96+48*4] = [49+192, 96+192] = [241,288] -> safe.\n\nTurn98: y98=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7? Actually freeway8: (96,49,right,48) -> same -> safe.\n\nBut note: at turn98, we are at freeway8 -> and freeway8 is safe? But the dangerous freeways at turn98 are 2,3,4,5 -> 8 is not in there.\n\nSo the entire sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\n\nAnd then at the beginning of turn99, we are at y99=9.\n\nBut the problem says we must have H=7 actions? And the sequence is for t=93 to 93+6=99? But in our sequence, we have 6 actions: from 93 to 98. Then H=6? \n\nBut wait: the problem requires the state at turn93+H-1 to be 9. If H=6, then we require at turn93+5=98 to be 9? But in our sequence, at turn98 we are at y98=8, not 9. Then we take action at turn98 (U) and then at turn99 we are at 9. But then the state at turn98 (the beginning) is 8, not 9.\n\nSo if we do 6 actions, we are at turn99: and the state at turn99 is 9. But the problem says we require the state at turn93+H-1 to be 9. For H=6, that would be turn93+5=98. But we are at 8 at turn98.\n\nTherefore, we need to be at 9 at turn98? Then we would do:\n\nWe need to be at y98=9.\n\nThen we have 5 actions (from turn93 to 97) to go from y93=3 to y98=9: net +6 in 5 moves -> that requires at least 6 ups and 0 downs? But 5 moves: we can only get +5 maximum? So impossible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7: we are at y99=9.\n\nBut then the state at turn93+7-1 = turn99 is 9 -> that matches.\n\nAnd we have 7 actions: from turn93 to turn99.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we only used 6 actions to get to y99=9? How? We did 6 actions (turns93 to 98) and then at turn99 we are at 9. But we haven't taken an action at turn99? \n\nThe sequence for H=7 would be:\n\nAction93: U -> y94=4\nAction94: U -> y95=5\nAction95: U -> y96=6\nAction96: U -> y97=7\nAction97: U -> y98=8\nAction98: U -> y99=9\nAction99: ? -> but we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn99, and we take an action at turn99. But then we move to y100 = 9 + d99.\n\nBut the problem says we require the state at turn99 (the beginning) to be 9. Then we take an action at turn99. But the goal is met at the beginning of turn99. However, the problem requires a sequence of 7 actions? \n\nBut the goal condition is met at the beginning of turn99, and then we take an action at turn99. That might move us away? But the problem doesn't say we have to stay. It only says \"reach\" at turn99.\n\nBut then the collision at turn99: we are at y99=9 -> safe.\n\nAnd the action at turn99 can be anything? But the problem doesn't specify what to do after reaching. However, we are only concerned with the collisions during the sequence? The collisions are checked at every turn from 93 to 99? \n\nAt turn99: we are at y99=9 -> safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\nTurn99: S   (or U? but if we do U, we go to 10 which is invalid? But the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we cannot go to 10. So we must do S or D. But we are at 9 at the beginning of turn99. If we do U, then y100=10 -> invalid. So we must do S or D. But the goal is already met at the beginning of turn99. So we can do S.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence is to reach (0,9) at turn99 (the beginning). Then the action at turn99 is just to complete the sequence of H=7 actions. And we don't care about the state after that.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\nTurn99: S\n\nBut wait: at turn98, we are at y98=8. Then we do U at turn98: then y99=9. Then at turn99 we do S: then y100=9.\n\nBut we don't care about y100.\n\nNow, check collisions at each turn:\n\nTurn93: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as above)\nTurn94: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (as above)\nTurn95: y=5 -> freeway5: safe\nTurn96: y=6 -> freeway6: safe\nTurn97: y=7 -> freeway7: safe\nTurn98: y=8 -> freeway8: safe\nTurn99: y=9 -> safe (no car)\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut note: at turn96, we are at y96=6. But we must avoid freeway1 at turn96? But we are at 6, not 1 -> safe.\n\nAt turn98: we are at y98=8 -> which is not in {2,3,4,5} -> safe.\n\nAt turn99: we are at 9 -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7? But could we do it in 6?\n\nIf H=6, we require the state at turn93+5=98 to be 9.\n\nWe need to go from 3 to 9 in 5 actions: net +6 in 5 moves -> that requires 6 ups and 0 downs? But 5 moves: maximum net +5. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut wait: what if we take a faster route? For example, we might use some downs to avoid the dangerous freeways and then go up? But that would take more moves. Since we need net +6, and we can only get at most +1 per move, we need at least 6 moves. But then we have to have the state at the beginning of the last turn (which is turn93+H-1) to be 9. \n\nWith 6 moves (H=6), we would have the state at turn98 (93+6-1=98) being 9. But to get from 3 to 9 in 5 moves? Impossible.\n\nWith 7 moves, we have the state at turn99 being 9, and we use 6 moves (from 93 to 98) to get the net +6, and then the last move at turn99 we do S (or D, but S is safe) to stay at 9? Actually, we don't need to stay, but we do an action.\n\nBut note: the 6 moves from 93 to 98: we do U each time, and then at turn99 we do S.\n\nBut we have to check if we can avoid the dangerous times with 6 moves? Actually, we don't have a choice: we must do 6 U's to get from 3 to 9 in 6 moves? But then the state at the beginning of turn99 is 9, which is what we require for H=7.\n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to move down? But that would require even more moves.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 7 without being on dangerous freeways? We already did: the path 3->4->5->6->7->8->9 is safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn96, we are at y96=6. But the dangerous freeway at turn96 is freeway1 -> we are at 6, so safe.\n\nAt turn98: we are at y98=8 -> safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut what if we tried to go faster? We cannot.\n\nAlternatively, what if we try to be at a different freeway at turn96? But we don't need to: we are safe at 6.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\nTurn99: S   (we could also do D? but then we go to 8, but we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn99, and the goal is met. But the problem doesn't require to stay. However, we must not go out of bounds: if we do D, then y100=8 -> valid. But we don't care. But the problem doesn't specify. However, to be safe, we can do S.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions\", but after the goal, we are not required to avoid? But we have to avoid during the sequence of turns 93 to 99. At turn99, we are at 9, then if we do D, we go to 8 at turn100, but that turn is not in the sequence? The sequence only goes to turn99. And the collision condition is only checked at the turns we are in the sequence? The problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars ...\". It doesn't specify the time range. But the context is during the game until we reach. Since we reach at turn99, and the sequence is until turn99, we must avoid collisions at turns 93 to 99. At turn99, we are at 9 -> safe. Then we do an action at turn99: that leads to turn100, but turn100 is not part of the sequence? The problem does not require to avoid collision at turn100? So we can do D? But that would be:\n\nAt turn99: we are at y99=9, then do D: then y100=8. But the problem doesn't care about turn100. And we have not violated any condition during turns93-99.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And at turn99, we are at 9 -> no collision. Then the action at turn99: we do D, but that doesn't cause a collision at turn99? The collision at turn99 is only about being on a freeway at the beginning of turn99. Then we take the action. The action might lead to a collision at turn100? But we don't care about turn100.\n\nSo we can do D at turn99? But why would we? The problem only requires the sequence to avoid collisions during the turns we are in the sequence? The sequence includes turn99: meaning we are present at turn99 (beginning) and we take an action at turn99. But the collision at turn99 is already checked (at the beginning). The action we take at turn99 doesn't cause a collision at turn99? It causes the next state.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do S.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify. So we can choose any action at turn99 as long as we don't go out of bounds. Since we are at 9, we cannot do U (because 10 is invalid). So we must do S or D.\n\nWe choose S.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\nTurn99: S\n\nBut wait: the problem says the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: S\n\nBut note: the last turn in the sequence is turn99? And H=7.\n\nBut what if we can do it in fewer than 7? We cannot.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at 9 earlier? For example, at turn98? Then we would require the state at turn98 to be 9. Then we need to get from 3 to 9 in 5 moves? Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a detour to avoid a collision? But we don't have any collision in this path.\n\nBut what if we were forced to avoid turn96 at freeway6? But we are not on freeway1 at turn96.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go down to freeway0 to avoid something? But that would take extra moves.\n\nBut we don't need to.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut note: the dangerous freeway1 at turn96: if we were to be at freeway1 at turn96, we would have to avoid. But we are not.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut let me double-check the car at freeway1: dangerous only at turn96.\n\nAnd we are at freeway6 at turn96 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn98 and 99, we are at freeway8 and then 9 -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have 7 turns (actions). Is there a way with 6? No.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"turns\" in H. And we have H=7.\n\nBut what if we do 6 actions and be at 9 at the beginning of turn99? That would require the last action (at turn98) to bring us to 9 at turn99. Then the state at turn99 is 9. But for H=6, we require the state at turn93+6-1 = turn98 to be 9? It is not: at turn98 we are at 8. Then we do U at turn98 to get to 9 at turn99. But then the state at turn98 is 8, not 9. So we must have H=7.\n\nThus, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 93\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at the specified dangerous turns.\n\n- Dangerous turns and freeways:\n  - Turn 96: Freeway 1 is dangerous (car spans position 0).\n  - Turns 98 and 99: Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are dangerous (cars span position 0).\n\nThe sequence of actions moves the player upward from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 6 moves (all \"U\" actions), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 99. The action at turn 99 is \"S\" (stay) to remain within bounds, as \"U\" would move to \\(y = 10\\), which is invalid.\n\n- **Turn-by-turn positions and safety**:\n  - Turn 93: Start at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at turn 93).\n  - Turn 94: Move to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe at turn 94).\n  - Turn 95: Move to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe at turn 95).\n  - Turn 96: Move to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe at turn 96; avoids freeway 1).\n  - Turn 97: Move to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe at turn 97).\n  - Turn 98: Move to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe at turn 98; avoids freeways 2-5).\n  - Turn 99: Stay at \\(y = 9\\) (freeway 9, no cars, safe; goal reached).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: S\n```\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 93: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 95: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 96: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 98: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 99: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 96. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the position of the car's head and tail moving left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 96 onwards to get to y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are given at turn t_1=96, with their positions and speeds. I need to compute where they are at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nThe car update: for a car on freeway k, at turn T > t_1, the span changes based on direction and speed.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, the span is shifted by -s * Δt for left-moving or +s * Δt for right-moving? The notation is a bit messy.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the left-moving case, it says [h, τ] and then [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt], which makes sense for left-moving, decreasing positions.\n\nBut for right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nIn the initial state, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left and h is right, but head and tail could be confusing.\n\nLet's clarify the car state notation.\n\nIn the table, for each freeway, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for direction, left or right.\n\nThen, for the span:\n\n- If direction is left, span is [h, τ] at t_1, and since it's moving left, positions decrease over time.\n\n- If direction is right, span is [τ, h] at t_1? The text says for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" which suggests that τ is the left end and h is the right end for right-moving cars.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1, it has (48, 37, right, 12). Since direction is right, head should be the front when moving right, so h=48 is probably the head, and τ=37 is tail, meaning at t_1, the car is from 37 to 48, and since moving right, τ=37 is left, h=48 is right.\n\nThen for the span, at t_1, for right-moving, it should be [min, max] = [37, 48], I think.\n\nBut the notation says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right, so [37, 48] in this case.\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [37 + s*Δt, 48 + s*Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] which might be [min, max] or [head, tail]? For left-moving, if head is front, moving left, h should be left position, τ right? But in the input, all cars here are right-moving, I think.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) → so head=48, tail=37, right direction. So at t_1, span from 37 to 48, moving right.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) → head=-48, tail=-59? -59 to -48? Since -59 < -48, so span from -59 to -48, moving right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5 same as 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36) → head=-48, tail=-83, so span from -83 to -48, moving right.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48) → from -95 to -48\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so for each, at time T, the span is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nWhere for each car, τ and h are given at t_1.\n\nIn the notation, τ is tail, h is head.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in the span at time T, i.e., min_span(T) ≤ 0 ≤ max_span(T)\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, but the grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, cars horizontally, so collision when y-coordinate matches and x=0 is within car span.\n\nNow, the key point: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at each turn, you are only on one freeway, specifically, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check collision only with the car on that y_T at that exact turn T.\n\nWhen you take an action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, you are at position (0, y_T), and collision depends on cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move, say from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, but during turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, for the cars, since they move continuously, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nBut each freeway has only one car, I assume? From the table, each freeway has one entry, so one car per freeway.\n\nFreeway k has one car.\n\nNow, for freeway k, at time T, the car span is as given.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, for a car on freeway k, with given (h, τ, d, s) at t_1, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s*(T - t_1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T - t_1)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ is left, h is right, so min = τ + s*Δt, max = h + s*Δt.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at time T if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nOtherwise, safe on that freeway at that time.\n\nPlayer needs to be on freeway k only when it is safe, i.e., no collision at that turn.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t_1=96.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway with cars; freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so always safe. The goal is (0,9), so once at y=9, it's safe.\n\ny=0 is also safe, since no cars.\n\nCars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo, position y=0 and y=9 are safe havens.\n\nPlayer needs to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but not necessarily all, since can move up and down.\n\nTo minimize turns, probably wants to go up directly, but need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is in the car span.\n\nSince the car span moves with time, I need to solve for T when min <= 0 <= max.\n\nThat is, τ + s*(T - t_1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T - t_1)\n\nWith t_1 = 96.\n\nAlso, since positions can be negative or positive, but we care about when 0 is covered.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's compute the unsafe intervals for T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, head h=48, tail τ=37, direction right, speed s=12.\n\nAt time T, min = τ + s*(T - 96) = 37 + 12*(T - 96)\n\nMax = h + s*(T - 96) = 48 + 12*(T - 96)\n\nUnsafe when min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo 37 + 12*(T - 96) <= 0 <= 48 + 12*(T - 96)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, 37 + 12(T - 96) <= 0\n\n12(T - 96) <= -37\n\nT - 96 <= -37/12 = -3.0833, so T <= 96 - 3.0833 = 92.9167, since T turn, integer, T <= 92? Let's keep fractional.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48 + 12(T - 96)\n\n0 <= 48 + 12T - 12*96\n\n0 <= 12T + 48 - 1152\n\n0 <= 12T - 1104\n\n12T >= 1104\n\nT >= 1104/12 = 92\n\nNow, the other inequality: 37 + 12(T-96) <= 0\n\n12(T-96) <= -37\n\nT-96 <= -37/12 = -3.0833\n\nT <= 96 - 3.0833 = 92.9167\n\nSince T integer, T <= 92\n\nAnd from above, T >= 92\n\nSo T >= 92 and T <= 92.9167, so T=92 only? T integer.\n\nT >= 92 and T <= 92.9167, so T=92.\n\nAt T=92, min = 37 + 12(92-96) = 37 + 12(-4) = 37 - 48 = -11\n\nMax = 48 + 12(-4) = 48 - 48 = 0\n\nSo min = -11, max=0, so 0 is in [-11,0], yes, min<=0<=max.\n\nAt T=93, min = 37 +12(93-96)=37+12(-3)=37-36=1\n\nMax=48+12(-3)=48-36=12\n\nSo min=1, max=12, 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, T=91, min=37+12(91-96)=37+12(-5)=37-60=-23\n\nMax=48+12(-5)=48-60=-12\n\nmin=-23, max=-12, both negative, 0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSo indeed, for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=92.\n\nBut t_1=96, and T=92 is before t_1, so for T >= t_1=96, since min and max increase with T, at T=96, min=37+12(0)=37, max=48, both positive, so 0 not covered. Similarly for later T, min and max larger, so always safe for T>=96.\n\nT=96: min=37, max=48, both >0, 0 not in span.\n\nT=97: min=37+12=49? min=37 +12(97-96)=37+12=49, max=48+12=60, etc, all min>0, so never unsafe for T>=96.\n\nSimilarly, at T=92 it was unsafe, but that's before start, not relevant.\n\nSo for freeway 1, for all T >=96, it is safe, no collision possible.\n\nNow, freeway 2: k=2, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=6.\n\nAt t_1=96, span min = τ + s*(T-96)? min = τ + s*Δt, since τ is tail, left end.\n\nmin = τ + s*(T - 96) = -59 + 6*(T - 96)\n\nmax = h + s*(T - 96) = -48 + 6*(T - 96)\n\nUnsafe when min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -59 + 6(T-96) <= 0 <= -48 + 6(T-96)\n\nFirst, left inequality: -59 + 6(T-96) <= 0\n\n6(T-96) <= 59\n\nT-96 <= 59/6 ≈ 9.8333\n\nT <= 96 + 9.8333 = 105.8333\n\nSince T integer, T <= 105\n\n6(T-96) <= 59, T-96 <= 59/6 = 9 + 5/6 ≈9.833, so T <= 105.833, T<=105\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= -48 + 6(T-96)\n\n0 <= -48 + 6T - 576\n\n0 <= 6T - 624\n\n6T >= 624\n\nT >= 624/6 = 104\n\nNow, also, min <=0 <= max must both hold.\n\nSo T >=104 and T <=105\n\nFor T=104: min = -59 +6(104-96) = -59 +6(8) = -59 +48 = -11\n\nmax = -48 +6(8) = -48 +48 =0\n\nSo min=-11 <=0 <=0=max, yes, 0 in span.\n\nT=105: min = -59 +6(105-96) = -59 +6(9) = -59 +54 = -5\n\nmax = -48 +6(9) = -48 +54 =6\n\nmin=-5 <=0 <=6, yes.\n\nT=106: min = -59 +6(10) = -59+60=1\n\nmax = -48+60=12\n\nmin=1>0, 0 not <= max? 0<1, not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nT=103: min = -59 +6(103-96)= -59 +6(7)= -59+42= -17\n\nmax = -48 +42 = -6\n\nboth negative, 0 not in [-17,-6], safe.\n\nSo unsafe at T=104 and T=105.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? k=3: (-48, -59, right, 6) identical to k=2.\n\nSo same, unsafe at T=104,105.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48,-59,right,6), unsafe T=104,105.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe T=104,105.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed s=36.\n\nmin = τ + s*(T-96) = -83 + 36*(T-96)\n\nmax = h + s*(T-96) = -48 + 36*(T-96)\n\nUnsafe when min <=0<=max\n\n-83 +36(T-96) <=0 <= -48 +36(T-96)\n\nLeft: -83 +36(T-96) <=0\n\n36(T-96) <=83\n\nT-96 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.30555\n\nT <= 96 + 2.30555 = 98.30555, so T<=98\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +36(T-96)\n\n0 <= -48 +36T - 3456\n\n0 <= 36T - 3504\n\n36T >= 3504\n\nT >= 3504/36 = 97.333...? 3504 ÷ 36.\n\n36*97 = 36*100 - 36*3 = 3600 - 108 = 3492\n\n3504 - 3492 = 12, so 97 + 12/36 = 97 + 1/3 ≈97.333\n\nSo T >= 97.333, since T integer, T >= 98\n\nNow T >=98 and T <=98.305, so T=98\n\nCheck:\n\nT=98: min = -83 +36(98-96) = -83 +36*2 = -83 +72 = -11\n\nmax = -48 +72 = 24\n\n-11 <=0<=24, yes.\n\nT=97: min = -83 +36(1) = -83 +36 = -47\n\nmax = -48 +36 = -12\n\nboth negative, 0 not in [-47,-12]\n\nT=99: min = -83 +36(3) = -83 +108=25\n\nmax = -48 +108=60\n\nboth positive, 0 not in [25,60]\n\nSo unsafe only at T=98.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed s=48.\n\nmin = τ + s*(T-96) = -95 + 48*(T-96)\n\nmax = h + s*(T-96) = -48 + 48*(T-96)\n\nUnsafe when min <=0<=max\n\n-95 +48(T-96) <=0 <= -48 +48(T-96)\n\nLeft: -95 +48(T-96) <=0\n\n48(T-96) <=95\n\nT-96 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979166\n\nT <= 96 + 1.979166 = 97.979166, so T<=97\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +48(T-96)\n\n0 <= -48 +48T - 48*96\n\n0 <= 48T - 4608 -48? -48*96= -4608, and -48, so 0 <= 48T - 4608 -48 = 48T - 4656\n\nBetter: 0 <= -48 + 48(T-96) = -48 + 48T - 4608 = 48T - 4656\n\nSo 48T - 4656 >=0\n\n48T >= 4656\n\nT >= 4656 / 48\n\nCompute: 48*97 = 48*100 - 48*3 = 4800 - 144 = 4656\n\nExactly 4656, so T >= 97\n\nNow T >=97 and T <=97.979, so T=97\n\nCheck:\n\nT=97: min = -95 +48(97-96) = -95 +48*1 = -95+48= -47\n\nmax = -48 +48*1 = -48+48=0\n\n-47 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nT=96: min = -95 +48(0) = -95\n\nmax = -48\n\nboth negative, 0 not in span.\n\nT=98: min = -95 +48(2) = -95+96=1\n\nmax = -48+96=48\n\nmin=1>0, not cover 0.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=97.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, (-48,-95,right,48), unsafe only at T=97.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: safe all T>=96\n\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at T=104,105\n\n- Freeway 3: same, unsafe T=104,105\n\n- Freeway 4: same, unsafe T=104,105\n\n- Freeway 5: same, unsafe T=104,105\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at T=98\n\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at T=97\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at T=97\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 all unsafe at same times: 104 and 105.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t_1=96, position y=0.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\ny from 0 to 9, need to go up 9 units.

Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? The position at the end.\n\nThe turn indices.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we get y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, we have y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nWe need that at some turn, y_T =9 for T between t_1 and t_1 + H -1? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we set y_{t_1 + H}, but y_{t_1 + H -1} is before that action? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, position is y_T.\n\nThen player chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and cars at T.\n\nWe need that at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we need to specify actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which determine y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\ny_{t_1} is given, no action at that time, I think.\n\nActions start at turn t_1 to move.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1 for actions, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we have y_{t_1+1}, after a_{t_1+1}, y_{t_1+2}, ..., after a_{t_1+H-1}, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is determined by the actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}, because y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 + H -2} + Δy_{t_1 + H -2}, from action at turn t_1 + H -2.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}=0.\n\nAction a_{t_1} determines y_{t_1+1}.\n\nAt turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}, then action a_{t_1+1} determines y_{t_1+2}, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo have y_T =9 at some T.\n\nThe condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we have H actions from turn t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nThe first action a_{t_1} affects y_{t_1+1}, last action a_{t_1+H-1} affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is affected by actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t_1 + k} , because actions from t=0 to H-2 for the change to y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nLet S be the number of steps to increase y.\n\nSince y starts at 0, ends at 9, and each action changes y by -1,0,+1, the net change must be +9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H to achieve net +9 with actions U,D,S.\n\nIf we only go up, H=9 actions: from turn 96 to 104, actions U each, then at turn 97 y=1, turn 98 y=2, ..., turn 105 y=9? Let's compute turns.\n\nAt turn 96: y=0\n\nAfter a_{96}: if U, y_{97}=1\n\nAt turn 97: y=1\n\nAfter a_{97}: if U, y_{98}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{104}: if U, y_{105}=9\n\nThen at turn 105, y=9.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=96, so t_1 + H -1 =96 + H -1\n\nSet this to 105, so 96 + H -1 =105, then H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so 10 actions: a_{96} to a_{105}, and y_{105} = y_{96} + sum of Δy from a_{96} to a_{104}? y_{105} is set by a_{104}, since y_{105} = y_{104} + Δy_{104}\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{96 + H -1}\n\nSet y_{96 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the above, with 9 up moves, we can have y_{105} =9 if we start from y_{96}=0.\n\ny_{105} = y_{104} + Δy_{104}, and to have y_{105}=9, with y_{104}=8, Δy_{104}=U.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{96 + H -1}\n\nFor y_{105} to be 9, we need 96 + H -1 =105, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions a_{96} to a_{105}, but a_{105} determines y_{106}, not y_{105}.\n\ny_{105} is determined by previous actions.\n\nTo have y_{105} =9, we need that after H-1 actions, y is 9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =105, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: a_{96}, a_{97}, ..., a_{105}, that's 10 actions.\n\nBut a_{105} affects y_{106}, which is beyond.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is set by the actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nFor example, to have y_{105} =9, we need actions from a_{96} to a_{104}, which determine y_{97} to y_{105}.\n\nActions: a_{96} sets y_{97}, a_{97} sets y_{98}, ..., a_{104} sets y_{105}.\n\nSo to set y_{105}, we need actions from a_{96} to a_{104}, which is 9 actions (t=0 to 8 for H=9? Let's index.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for actions, so for H actions, actions at t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nThe position after k actions is y_{t_1 + k} for k=1 to H.\n\ny_{t_1 + k} is set by a_{t_1 + k -1} for k=1 to H.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 +1} by a_{t_1}, y_{t_1+2} by a_{t_1+1}, ..., y_{t_1 + H} by a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is set by a_{t_1 + H -2}, for H-1 >=1.\n\nFor example, to have y_{105} =9, it is set by a_{104}.\n\nSo actions up to a_{104} are needed, which is the (H-1)-th action if H actions from t=0.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1 =96 + H -1\n\nWe want T such that y_T =9.\n\ny_T is determined by actions a_{96} to a_{T-1} for T>96, or for T=96, y_{96} given.\n\nFor T=96, y=0, not 9.\n\nSo T>96, y_T = y_{96} + sum_{k=96}^{T-1} Δy_k\n\nSince y_{96}=0, y_T = sum of Δy from k=96 to T-1.\n\nTo have y_T=9, net +9 from the actions between turn 96 and T-1.\n\nThe number of actions is from turn 96 to turn T-1, which is (T-1) - 96 +1 = T - 96 actions.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, is such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 = T, so T =96 + H -1\n\nActions from a_{96} to a_{T-1} = a_{96} to a_{96 + H -2}\n\nFor H turns, actions at turns 96 to 96+H-1.\n\nThen y_{96 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions that affect y_{96 + H -1} are a_{96} to a_{96 + H -2}, which are the first H-1 actions.\n\nWith net +9 from these actions.\n\nSince we can have S actions, it might take more turns, but to minimize H, we should avoid S and D, and go up as much as possible, but with collision constraints.\n\nIn the direct path, to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps: from turn 96 to 104, actions U each, then y_{97}=1, y_{98}=2, ..., y_{105}=9.\n\nSo at turn 105, y=9.\n\nThus T=105, so t_1 + H -1 =105, 96 + H -1=105, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a_{96} to a_{105}, but a_{105} is not used for y_{105}, it affects y_{106}.\n\nFor y_{105}=9, we need actions up to a_{104}, so actions a_{96} to a_{104} for t from 0 to 8, H=9 actions? Let's stop confusing.\n\nFrom the requirement: y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith t_1=96, so y_{96 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions {a_{96 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nFor example, if H=9, then y_{96+9-1}=y_{104}=9, and actions a_{96} to a_{104}.\n\nThen a_{96} sets y_{97}, ..., a_{104} sets y_{105}, so y_{104} is not set by these actions directly.\n\ny_{104} is the position at turn 104, which is set by a_{103}, since y_{104} = y_{103} + Δy_{103}\n\nTo have y_{104} =9, it must be that by turn 104, we are at 9.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions from 96 to 103: 8 actions U, y_{97}=1, y_{98}=2, ..., y_{104}=8, then to have y_{104}=9, we need to be at 8 at turn 103, then U at turn 103 to set y_{104}=9.\n\nBut at turn 103, y_{103}=8, then a_{103}=U, sets y_{104}=9.\n\nThen for y_{104}=9, we need actions up to a_{103}, which is 8 actions for from y_{97} to y_{104}, but y_{97} to y_{104} is 8 steps, from 1 to 8, but we start from y_{96}=0.\n\ny_{96}=0\n\na_{96}: U, y_{97}=1\n\na_{97}: U, y_{98}=2\n\n...\n\na_{102}: U, y_{103}=7? Let's list:\n\nTurn 96: y=0\n\na_{96}: U, y_{97}=1\n\nTurn 97: y=1\n\na_{97}: U, y_{98}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{102}: U, y_{103}=7? Action at turn k sets y_{k+1}.\n\nAt turn 102, y=6 (if all U so far)\n\na_{102}: U, sets y_{103}=7\n\nTurn 103: y=7\n\na_{103}: U, sets y_{104}=8\n\nTurn 104: y=8\n\na_{104}: U, sets y_{105}=9\n\nTo have y_{104}=9, at turn 104, we need to be at 9.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 104, y=8.\n\nTo have y_{104}=9, we must have been at y_{103}=8, and a_{103}=U.\n\nThen at turn 104, y=9.\n\nActions involved: a_{96} to a_{103} to set y_{104}=9.\n\na_{96} sets y_{97}, ..., a_{103} sets y_{104}.\n\nSo 8 actions: turns 96 to 103, for y_{104}=9.\n\nThen for y_{t_1 + H -1} =y_{104}=9, t_1 + H -1=104, 96 + H -1=104, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from a_{96} to a_{96+8} =a_{104}, but a_{104} sets y_{105}, not y_{104}.\n\nIn this case, actions a_{96} to a_{103} are 8 actions, for t from 0 to 7.\n\nWith H=9, actions t=0 to 8: a_{96} to a_{104}, but a_{104} is not used for y_{104}.\n\nSo for y_{104}=9, we need only actions up to a_{103}, so H=8 for the actions to set it, but the turn count.\n\nI think it's better to set T such that y_T=9.\n\nThen the turn T when we reach y=9.\n\nT must be >=96.\n\nThe actions before that, from turn 96 to T-1, determine y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: from 96 to T-1, that's (T-1) - 96 +1 = T - 96 actions.\n\nThen for the sequence, we have H actions, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 = T.\n\nThen number of actions to reach T is T - 96.\n\nBut H is the number of turns for the action sequence.\n\nWith y_T=9, T = t_1 + H -1 =96 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are from a_{96} to a_{96 + H -1}, but to have y_T=9 with T=96+H-1, we need actions up to a_{T-1} = a_{96 + H -2}.\n\nSo for the last action a_{96 + H -1}, it is not necessary for y_T, but it might be included in the sequence.\n\nIn the output, we need to specify actions until we reach, but the sequence includes actions for turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and at turn t_1+H-1, we have y_{t_1+H-1}=9, so no need for further action, but the action at t_1+H-1 is specified, but it doesn't change position since we are at goal.\n\nTo avoid confusion, for minimal H, we can assume we stop when we reach, so the last action is the one that moves us to 9 or we are at 9.\n\nBut in this case, since we start at 0, we need to move.\n\nThe fastest way is to reach in 9 steps: at turn 105, y=9, with actions U from 96 to 104.\n\nThen T=105, y_105=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =105, 96 + H -1=105, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions a_96 to a_105.\n\na_105 is at turn 105, but at turn 105, y=9, so if we do a_105, it might move us away, but since we are at goal, we can do S or something, but to minimize actions, we can stop, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach earlier, H smaller.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to delay or something.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: safe all T>=96\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=104,105\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=104,105\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=104,105\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=104,105\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=98\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=97\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=97\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at turn 96.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: move up each turn.\n\nAt turn 96: y=0, safe\n\na96: U, to y97=1\n\nAt turn 97: y=1, but freeway 1 is safe, but freeway 7 and 8 are unsafe at T=97? Freeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k.\n\nAt turn 97, if y97=1, then we are on freeway 1 at turn 97.\n\nFreeway 1 is safe at all T, so no problem.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are at y=7 and 8, not y=1.\n\nSo at turn 97, on y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen a97: U, to y98=2\n\nTurn 98: y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 is unsafe only at T=104 and 105, not at 98, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, continue up.\n\nBut at turn 98, y=2, freeway 2 safe.\n\na98: U, to y99=3\n\nTurn 99: y=3, freeway 3, unsafe only at 104,105, safe now.\n\na99: U, to y100=4\n\nTurn 100: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\na100: U, to y101=5\n\nTurn 101: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\na101: U, to y102=6\n\nTurn 102: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 is unsafe at T=98 only.\n\nAt T=102, not 98, so safe.\n\na102: U, to y103=7\n\nTurn 103: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=97 only, not 103, so safe.\n\na103: U, to y104=8\n\nTurn 104: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=97 only, not 104, so safe.\n\na104: U, to y105=9\n\nTurn 105: y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nBut at turn 105, y=9, goal reached.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 104, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=104 and 105.\n\nBut at turn 104, if we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4,5, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly at turn 105, y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 104, y=8, which is freeway 8, safe at T=104.\n\nAt turn 105, y=9, safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=104 and 105, but since we are not on those freeways, no problem.\n\nIn the direct path, we never are on freeway 2,3,4,5 at turns 104 or 105 because we are moving up.\n\nAt turn 104, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 105, y=9.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 are at y=2,3,4,5, which we passed earlier.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at y=2, we were on it at turn 98, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the direct path seems safe: actions U from turn 96 to 104, 9 actions, reaching y=9 at turn 105.\n\nH: y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{96 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 96 + H -1 =105, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a_{96} to a_{105}.\n\nBut a_{105} is at turn 105, when we are already at y=9, so we can do S, for example, to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach, but since we reach at turn 105, and we need to include actions for that turn? But the action at turn 105 is after position.\n\nTo be precise, with actions: a_{96} to a_{104}: all U, then at turn 105, y=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is y_{105} for H=10? t_1 + H -1 =96 +10 -1=105, yes.\n\nAnd actions a_{96} to a_{105}.\n\nAt turn 105, y=9, we can set a_{105}=S, for example, to not move.\n\nSimilarly, in the output.\n\nBut in this case, all is fine.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nAt turn 104, y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at T=104.\n\nBut freeway 8 is unsafe only at T=97, not 104.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe freeways at critical times.\n\nFor example, at turn 104, freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly at 105.\n\nAnd at turn 97, we are on y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nAt turn 98, on y=2, freeway 2, but unsafe only at 104,105, not 98.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at T=98 unsafe, but at turn 98, we are on y=2 if moving up, not on y=6.\n\nAt turn 98, if we go directly, at turn 98 y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 6 is at y=6, unsafe at T=98.\n\nBut we are on y=2, not y=6, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 97, freeway 7 and 8 unsafe, but we are on y=1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the direct path is safe with H=10, actions U from 96 to 104, and S at 105 or U, but since at y=9, S is fine.\n\nBut we can reach faster?\n\nMinimal H: since we need net +9, minimal actions is 9 U, but with the turn, H=10 as above.\n\nCan we reach earlier? For example, if we start moving faster, but we can only change by +1 per turn max, so from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 steps, so earliest at turn 105.\n\ny_{105}=9 as above.\n\nIf we do some S or D, it takes more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut with the cars, in this case it works.\n\nBut let's double-check if at some point we might be on unsafe freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn 104, if we were on y=5, but in our path, we are on y=8.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps if we delay, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=98\n\nAt turn 98, if we are on y=6, it would be collision.\n\nBut in the direct path, at turn 98, y=2, not 6.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 97, freeway 7 and 8 unsafe, but y=1, not 7 or 8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2-5, unsafe at 104 and 105, but we are not on them at those times.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nThen at turn 105, y=9, so we need to specify action at turn 105 for the sequence.\n\nSince H=10, actions to a_{105}.\n\nAt turn 105, y=9, we can do S.\n\nSo Turn 105: S\n\nBut in the sequence, we can do U, but y would be 10, but y must be in [0,9], so if U at y=9, y_{106}=10, invalid, so must do S or D, but D to 8, not good.\n\nSo at turn 105, since y=9, we should do S.\n\nSimilarly, in the action sequence.\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at turn 104.\n\nIs it possible to be at y=9 at turn 104?\n\nThat would require from turn 96 to 103, in 8 actions, net +9, but each action max +1, so maximum y_{104} = 8 with 8 U actions: y_{97}=1, ..., y_{104}=8.\n\ny_{104} <=8 with actions up to a_{103}.\n\nTo have y_{104}=9, impossible since y_{104} = y_{103} + Δy_{103}, and y_{103} <=8, so y_{104} <=9, but with y_{103}=8 and U, y_{104}=9.\n\nBut at turn 104, y=9.\n\nIn terms of turn, earliest possible is turn 104 with y=9, but that requires y_{103}=8 and a_{103}=U.\n\ny_{103}=8 can be achieved at turn 103 with actions from 96 to 102: 7 U, y_{103}=7? Let's see:\n\nStart turn 96: y=0\n\nAfter a96 U: y97=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a102 U: y103=7 (since 7 steps from 97 to 103)\n\ny_{103} = y_{96} + sum from k=96 to 102 of Δy_k? Actions a96 to a102 set y97 to y103.\n\na96 sets y97, ..., a102 sets y103.\n\nNumber of actions: from a96 to a102 is 7 actions (turns 96 to 102), setting y97 to y103.\n\nWith all U, y97=1, y98=2, ..., y103=7.\n\nThen at turn 103, y=7, then a103=U, sets y104=8.\n\nThen at turn 104, y=8.\n\nTo have y104=9, need y103=8 and U at 103.\n\nBut y103=8 requires that at turn 103, position is 8, which can be from earlier.\n\ny103 = y96 + sum from k=96 to 102 Δy_k\n\ny96=0, so y103 = sum of 7 actions, each <=1, so y103 <=7.\n\nThus y103 <=7, so with a103=U, y104=8, max.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before turn 105.\n\nSimilarly, y105=9 is earliest.\n\nThus minimal H=10.\n\nAnd with the car constraints, the direct path works.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 105, we do S.\n\nNow, output the actions from turn 96 to 105.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: S\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision at turn 104 and 105.\n\nSuppose we do nothing, but in this case, we are not on the unsafe freeways.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 is unsafe at T=98, but we are on y=2 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps if we go slower, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 96\\) is 10. This is achieved by moving up (U) for the first 9 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 105, and then staying (S) at turn 105 to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the car states and unsafe times:\n\n- Freeway 1 is safe for all turns \\(T \\geq 96\\).\n- Freeway 2 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 104\\) and \\(T = 105\\).\n- Freeway 3 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 104\\) and \\(T = 105\\).\n- Freeway 4 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 104\\) and \\(T = 105\\).\n- Freeway 5 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 104\\) and \\(T = 105\\).\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn \\(T = 98\\).\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe only at turn \\(T = 97\\).\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn \\(T = 97\\).\n\nIn the action sequence:\n- At turn 97, the player is on freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\)), which is safe.\n- At turn 98, the player is on freeway 2 (\\(y = 2\\)), which is safe since unsafe only at \\(T = 104\\) and \\(105\\).\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe at \\(T = 98\\), but the player is on \\(y = 2\\), not \\(y = 6\\), so no collision.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at \\(T = 97\\), but the player is on \\(y = 1\\), not \\(y = 7\\) or \\(8\\), so no collision.\n- At turns 104 and 105, freeways 2–5 are unsafe, but the player is on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 104 (freeway 8, safe) and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 105 (safe), so no collision.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 96 to turn 105 is:\n\n- Turn 96: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 97)\n- Turn 97: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 98)\n- Turn 98: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 99)\n- Turn 99: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 100)\n- Turn 100: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 101)\n- Turn 101: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 102)\n- Turn 102: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 103)\n- Turn 103: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 104)\n- Turn 104: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 105)\n- Turn 105: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\))\n\nAt turn 105, \\(y_{105} = 9\\), satisfying the goal with \\(H = 10\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 96: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 101: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 102: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 103: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 104: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 105: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",
