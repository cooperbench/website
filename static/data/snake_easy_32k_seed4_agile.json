Let me check: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (3, 5, 9, 1) - (6, 6, 9, 1) - (6, 4, 10, 1)\" and it says value, so (x,y, life_span, value). Value is 1 for all, so all positive food. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 1, life span 9 means it will disappear after 9 more turns, I think. Life span is given, and it decreases each turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t+L. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, it's L-1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn 1, life span 9, so it will be there until turn 9, and disappear before turn 10? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, after the turn, countdown decreases. But when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Typically, it might be: at the beginning of turn, if life span >0, food is present; after the turn, life span decreases by 1.

So (1,3) is x=1, y=3, which is not border, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are safe? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so for x, valid from 1 to 6? Let's see: walls are at x=0 and x=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls.

Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to new_pos, then the segment that was at (2,3) moves to new_head position? No.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head, index 1: body segment.\n> \n> After move: new head position based on move.\n> \n> Then, the body segment at index 1 moves to the old head position (2,3).\n> \n> So the new snake positions: [new_head, old_head]\n> \n> Old head was (2,3), so body moves to (2,3), and tail was (3,3), but since only one body segment, the tail is now at (2,3), and (3,3) is empty.\n> \n> For collision: if new head position is the same as any body segment except the current tail, it's collision. But since the body moves after, it's the positions before move that matter for collision, except that the tail will move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, before move, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's collision unless that segment is the tail, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, body segments are only (3,3), which is the tail.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,3), it should be ok, because after move, tail moves away to (2,3) or something.\n> \n> Let's see: if I move right to (3,3), but I cannot move right because reverse, and also (3,3) is current tail.\n> \n> But possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3).

So it disappears after turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> So, for example, at turn t, life span N, it decreases to N-1 after this turn, and so on. When life span reaches 0, it disappears, so it is present for N turns starting from turn t.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span N, it is present, and will be present for the next N-1 turns?

After turn 2, life span 7, so it decreases at the end of turn or during? The countdown decreases every turn including current, meaning after the turn is processed, it decreases.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: at the beginning of turn t, life span is L, and after the turn, it decreases by 1. So for food to be eaten on turn t, it must have L > 0 at the start of turn.\n> \n> For (3,5) at turn 2, L=8, so it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9, and disappears before turn 10. Similarly for others.\n> \n> But since L is high, 8 and 9, and we're at turn 2, all food will be around for a while.\n> \n> Now, snake is short, only 2 segments: head at (2,4), tail at (2,3).

But currently, tail is at (2,3), head at (2,4), so they are adjacent vertically. Tail has no food, I think; food is at different positions.\n> \n> The tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, snake grows, so the new tail is where the tail was, and head moves to tail position, causing collision.\n> \n> But here, tail at (2,3) has no food; food is elsewhere.\n> \n> So no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> Now, let's think about moving towards food.\n> \n> Closest food seems to be (3,5), which is at (3,5).

So on turn 3, life span 7, it will disappear after turn 9? Let me calculate.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will be gone after N-1 more turns? No.\n> \n> If life span is L at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it disappears when life span reaches 0. After turn t + L - 1, it should be gone? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, life span is L. After one turn, turn t+1, life span is L-1, and so on. When life span becomes 0, it disappears. So it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, L=7, it exists for 7 turns: turns t, t+1, ..., t+6.

Turns: turn 3 (L=7), turn 4 (L=6), ..., turn 9 (L=1), turn 10 (L=0, gone). So it disappears after turn 9, meaning on turn 10 it's not there.

Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, it might be top or bottom. The problem doesn't specify, but since head direction is U for (x,y+1), I think y increases upwards, so (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head at (2,5): x=2, y=5\n> \n> - Body at (2,4): x=2, y=4\n> \n> - Food at (3,5): x=3, y=5 — directly to the right, same row.\n> \n> - Food at (6,6): x=6, y=6 — up and right\n> \n> - Food at (6,4): x=6, y=4 — down and right, but y=4 is below y=5? y=4 is lower than y=5 if y increases up.\n> \n> y=5 to y=4 is down, y=5 to y=6 is up.\n> \n> So (6,4) is at x=6, y=4, which is down-right from head.\n> \n> (6,6) is up-right.\n> \n> Also obstacle at (3,6): x=3, y=6.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food might disappear, I should aim to eat them when possible.\n> \n> But also, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's see immediate options.\n> \n> From head (2,5), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,6)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) has food!

So head is at (3,5), and direction is R, which is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (3,5). Since head direction is R, and it's at (3,5), the previous position must have been to the left, but let's see the positions: snake positions are head first: (3,5) is head, then (2,5), then (2,4). So from (2,5) to (3,5) is moving right, so direction R makes sense.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.

After turn t, life span becomes L-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0, I think. But the description says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning N turns from now, including current.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,6) with life span 6 at turn 4, it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning at turn 10 (since turn 4 + 6 = 10, but let's see: after turn 4, life span becomes 5 at turn 5?

To simplify, since we're at turn 4:\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 (since after turn 9, it would decrease to 0 and disappear). Turn 4: L=6, after turn 4: L=5; turn 5: L=5, after turn 5: L=4; ... after turn 9: L=0, disappear. So it can be eaten during turns 4 to 9 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4): life span 7 at turn 4, so can be eaten from turn 4 to 10.\n> \n> (3,2): life span 10, can be eaten from turn 4 to 13.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,5), body at (2,5), tail at (2,4).

No.\n> \n> Positions: suppose before move, snake segments: S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail)\n> \n> After move to new cell:\n> \n> - New head: new position\n> \n> - If not eat, then S1 moves to old S0, S2 to old S1, ..., Sk to old S_{k-1}, so tail moves away from old position.\n> \n> - If eat, then S1 moves to old S0, S2 to old S1, ..., but Sk stays, and a new segment is added at the position where the head was? Or the new head is added, and tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and the head adds a new segment.\n> \n> Typically: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment, with the tail fixed.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell D with food: new positions [D, A, B, C] if D is adjacent, etc. So the head moves to D, and the body is A, B, C, so C is still tail, no change to tail positions.\n> \n> In terms of positions: from [A, B, C], move to D (eat): new snake [D, A, B, C], so head at D, then A, B, C.\n> \n> C is still tail, at same position.\n> \n> Then the next move, if not eat, from [D, A, B, C], move to E, not food: new head E, then D, A, B, and C is left, so tail was C, now B is new tail.\n> \n> Back to our case.\n> \n> On turn 5, after moving to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (3,5)\n> \n> Turn 6, move D to (3,2), which has food, so eat.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)  // since tail (3,5) stays.\n> \n> Snake now length 4.\n> \n> Direction D.\n> \n> Life span of (3,2) was 10 at turn 4, but we ate it on turn 6?

Since it's turn 5, and life span decreases each turn including current, that means after turn 5, it has 4 turns left? Life span is given as 5, so at turn 5, it has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after N turns from when it spawned. The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> Let me read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food item with life span N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N. At turn t, the countdown is N, which decreases by 1 each turn.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 5, food at (6,6) has life span 5, so it appeared at some turn, but we don't know when. The life span is the remaining life at the current turn. So for (6,6), life span 5 at turn 5 means it will disappear at turn 5 + 5 = 10.

No, borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake: head at (4,5), body at (3,5), tail at (2,5).

No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.

Standard snake mechanics: when you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to a food cell, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the body doesn't grow immediately; the growth happens such that the tail remains in place for that turn, so the new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> But in movement, after eating, when the snake moves next, the tail doesn't advance, so it grows.\n> \n> But for collision, the head can move to the tail cell only if the tail moves away, but there's a special case about tail reward danger.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (2,5), and it's not adjacent to head. Head is at (4,5), tail at (2,5), so not adjacent; they are two cells apart.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,5) and (3,5) are adjacent, but (4,5) and (2,5) are not, since |4-2|=2, not 1.\n> \n> So no issue with that for now.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves to eat food while avoiding walls, obstacles, and self-collision.\n> \n> Also, since food has life span, I need to prioritize which one to go for based on how soon it disappears.\n> \n> (6,6) disappears at turn 10, so I have from turn 5 to 9 to eat it.

So I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> When moving to food, the head moves to (6,6), eats the food, so the tail does not move; the snake grows by one segment, which is added at the end.\n> \n> So positions: head at (6,6), body segments: the previous head (5,6) becomes body, previous body (5,5) becomes body, and since food eaten, the tail segment is not removed; instead, a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is at the previous tail position.\n> \n> After moving to food cell:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell (food cell)\n> \n> - Body segments follow: the segment that was head moves to old head position, etc.\n> \n> - But since food eaten, the last segment (tail) is not removed; instead, the snake length increases, so the tail stays, and a new segment is effectively added at the position where the tail was before the move? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, when you eat food, during the move, the head moves to the new cell (with food), the body moves as usual, but since food is eaten, the tail does not retract; so the snake gains a segment, meaning that after the move, the tail is still there, and the new head position is added.\n> \n> Initial positions before move: say S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to a non-food cell: new head at new position, then B1 at old H, B2 at old B1, ..., and T is removed, so new positions [new_head, old_H, old_B1, ..., old_B_{k-1}] for k segments.\n> \n> After moving to food cell: head moves to new position, B1 moves to old H, B2 to old B1, ..., and T stays in place, so the snake has one more segment: [new_head, old_H, old_B1, ..., old_B_{m-1}, T] where m is the number of body segments before.\n> \n> In this case, before moving to (6,6), positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), body (4,5) — that's three segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,6):\n> \n> - New head: (6,6)\n> \n> - Body: old head (5,6) becomes first body segment\n> \n> - Body: old first body (5,5) becomes second body segment\n> \n> - Since food eaten, the tail (old second body (4,5)) does not move; it stays as tail? No.\n> \n> The tail segment is not advanced; it remains, so the snake grows.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,6), then the previous segments: (5,6) as body, (5,5) as body, and (4,5) as tail. So snake is [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] — length 4.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, back to the plan.\n> \n> So if I go right on turn 5 to (5,5), then up on turn 6 to (5,6), then right on turn 7 to (6,6) to eat food.\n> \n> But on turn 7, I eat at (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) is at the corner? x=6, y=6, and borders are walls, so x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=6 not wall, since y=7 is wall. So (6,6) is safe to move to.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is fine.\n> \n> Now, after eating, snake is at (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5).\n> \n> Head at (6,6), direction after moving right is R.\n> \n> Now, from here, I can consider other food.\n> \n> But there's (6,4) below, at (6,4).\n> \n> From (6,6), I can move down to (6,5), but (6,5) is empty?

Since I'm moving to (4,5), which is the position of the first body segment, but after the move, that segment moves to where the head was or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a new position, the segment that was at (4,5) will move to (5,5) if head was there, but head is moving away.\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,5), segment1 (4,5), segment2 (3,5) which is tail.\n> \n> If I move left to (4,5), that cell is currently occupied by segment1. But after the move:\n> \n> - New head position: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment1 was at (4,5), but now it should move to where? The new position for segment1 is the previous head position, which is (5,5).

This is confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: the body follows the head. When head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves forward one cell if no food eaten, or stays if food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.

When the head moves to a cell that is occupied by the first body segment, it causes a collision because after the move, that cell is still occupied or something.\n> \n> I think there's a rule: you cannot move to a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, (4,5) is occupied by seg1, which is not the tail.

It's turn 7, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then body at (5,5), and tail at (4,5). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is down, which means it was moving down to reach (5,4) from (5,5)? Let me list the positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]. Since head is first, and direction is D (down), that means from (5,5) it moved down to (5,4), so the previous position was (5,5), and now head is at (5,4).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food here is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 means +1 point and length increases by 1 when eaten.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 7, for (6,6) life span 3, it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is given as the remaining life, I think. Let's see the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (6,6,3,1)\" so (x,y,life_span,value). And \"life-span disappears after N turns\" with N=life_span, and countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> So for (6,6), life_span=3 at turn 7, meaning it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, with life_span L, after this turn, life_span becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,6) at turn 7, life_span=3:\n> \n> - After turn 7, life_span=2\n> \n> - After turn 8, life_span=1\n> \n> - After turn 9, life_span=0, disappears at the start of turn 10? Or during the turn when it becomes 0?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, the life_span is the number of turns it will still be present, including turn t.\n> \n> So for (6,6) at turn 7, life_span=3, so it will be present on turns 7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) life_span=4 at turn 7: present on turns 7,8,9,10.\n> \n> (3,2) life_span=7: present on turns 7 to 13.\n> \n> (5,1) life_span=10: present on turns 7 to 16.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,4), direction down. Since it just moved down to (5,4), and positions are [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)], so the body is at (5,5) and (4,5). Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,4): U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can only move to x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is within bounds.\n> \n> Also, cannot move into body segments, except that moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move away.\n> \n> Current body segments: (5,5) and (4,5). Head is at (5,4), so moving to (5,5) would be into the body, which is not allowed unless it's the tail.\n> \n> (5,5) is the segment right after head, so it's not the tail; tail is (4,5). So moving to (5,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (4,5) might be possible if it's the tail.\n> \n> Let's list possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by the body, and it's not the tail; it's the second segment. So collision if we move up.\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) – is this within bounds? y=3, x=5. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is between 1 and 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive? Since grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x=1 to 6, similarly y=1 to 6.\n> \n> So (5,3): x=5 between 1-6, y=3 between 1-6, and no wall or obstacle mentioned, except internal obstacle at (3,6), which is different. So (5,3) is empty.\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) – x=4, y=4, should be empty.\n> \n> - Right: (6,4) – now (6,4) has food, but let's see if it's occupied. (6,4) is a food position, not snake body. Snake body is only at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). So (6,4) is free, but has food.\n> \n> Moving to a food cell eats it if head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, direction constraint: head direction is D (down), so I cannot move up immediately, because no instant reverse. Since I moved down to here, moving up would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning the snake was moving down to reach (5,4), so the previous move was down. Therefore, on the next turn, I cannot move up (opposite to down), so U is forbidden.\n> \n> Allowed moves: not opposite to current direction. Opposite of D is U, so I cannot move U.\n> \n> Possible directions: D, L, R (since down, left, right are not opposite to down; down is current, so I can move down again, or left, or right, but not up.\n> \n> Now, positions:\n> \n> - Down: to (5,3)\n> \n> - Left: to (4,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) has food with value 1, life span 4.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk of tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,5). Head at (5,4), so they are adjacent? (5,4) and (4,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (5,4) and (4,5): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be like (5,4) and (5,5), or (5,4) and (4,4), etc. So head and tail are not adjacent now; they are diagonal.\n> \n> So no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders and obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6) is on the top row, y=6.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5). So the snake is forming a sort of L shape.\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (6,6) - bottom-right? y=6 is top if we consider y increasing up? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa? The movement: U (x,y+1) so if y+1 is up, that means y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, D is (x,y-1), down.\n> \n> In the walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So for example, (1,1) bottom-left, (6,6) top-right? y=6 is just below top wall.\n> \n> y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Since y=0 is wall, y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row.\n> \n> Similarly x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (6,6): top-right, but (3,6) is also top row, x=3,y=6.\n> \n> (6,6) is at x=6,y=6.\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (6,6): top-right, life span 3 (disappears after turn 9)\n> \n> - (6,4): right, y=4, x=6, so middle-right? y=4 is row 4, since y=1 bottom, y=6 top, so y=4 is center-ish.\n> \n> - (3,2): left-bottom, x=3,y=2\n> \n> - (5,1): bottom, x=5,y=1, which is directly below head? Head at (5,4), so (5,1) is down at bottom.\n> \n> y=1 bottom.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,4), so (5,1) is straight down, 3 cells below.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,4) at turn 7:\n> \n> - D: to (5,3) - empty, no food\n> \n> - L: to (4,4) - empty, no food\n> \n> - R: to (6,4) - has food, value +1\n> \n> But if I move right to (6,4), I eat the food, length increases to 4. New positions: head to (6,4), then body: since I move, the body follows, so new head (6,4), then previous head (5,4) becomes body, then (5,5), then (4,5). So positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Tail is still (4,5) for now, but after move, tail moves to (5,5)? Let's see: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves forward, so if I eat food, tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases by 1, so tail stays in place, and a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn; the head moves to food, body follows, but since you grow, the tail remains, and you add a segment.\n> \n> Positions: after move without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous one, so tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, body follows, but tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail position.\n> \n> For example: current positions: H(5,4), B1(5,5), B2(4,5)\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4) which has food, I eat it. So new head at (6,4), then the previous head (5,4) becomes body, so B1 is now (5,4), then B2 is (5,5), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so B2 (5,5) stays, and a new segment is added where tail was? No.\n> \n> After eating, the new position: head at (6,4), then the body segments: the first body segment is the previous head position (5,4), second body is previous B1 (5,5), and tail is previous B2 (4,5), but since I ate, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows, meaning the last segment stays, so now the body has three segments: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), with head at (6,4). So positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Length increased from 3 to 4.\n> \n> If no eat, head moves to new, body follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> Back to moves.\n> \n> At turn 7, from (5,4), I can:\n> \n> - Move D to (5,3): no food, so snake moves: head to (5,3), body to (5,4) and (4,5)?

Let me clarify: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 mean that the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) because moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to get to (6,5). Current turn is t=9.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 9, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,6) with life span 1 at turn 9, after turn 9, it will be gone. So to eat it, I must move to (6,6) on turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) with value 1, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 13 (since 9+5-1? Let's see: life span 5 at turn 9, decreases each turn, so after 5 more turns? \"Disappears after N turns\" means N turns from now? But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life span is L, it will last until turn t + L - 1? I need to interpret.\n> \n> Assume that at turn t, a food has life span L, then it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L. For example, L=1 at turn 9: it can be eaten only on turn 9, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> L=5 at turn 9: can be eaten from turn 9 to 13, disappears at turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (6,6): value 1, life span 1, so must be eaten now on turn 9 or lost.\n> \n> Food at (3,2): value 1, life span 5, so available from turn 9 to 13.\n> \n> Food at (5,1): value 1, life span 8, available from turn 9 to 16.\n> \n> All food has value +1, no negative food mentioned, so all are positive.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,5), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is Up, I cannot move Down immediately, as that would be opposite.\n> \n> So allowed moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, positions:\n> \n> - Up: (6,5) to (6,6) – which has food with life span 1, so if I move up, I eat it.\n> \n> - Left: (6,5) to (5,5)\n> \n> - Right: (6,5) to (7,5) – but x=7 is wall, so collision, death. Cannot move right.\n> \n> Right to (7,5) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Down: not allowed, reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: Up or Left.\n> \n> If I move Up to (6,6), I eat the food there. Since it's positive, snake length increases by 1, so new segment added where? When snake eats, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so snake grows.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move immediately; the head moves to food, and since food is eaten, a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place or something? Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn, effectively growing.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: before move, head at (6,5), body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). Tail at (5,5).\n> \n> If I move Up to (6,6), which has food, I eat it, so new head at (6,6), and a new segment is added, so the body becomes: head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) becomes body, then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), and since I ate, new segment, so tail stays (5,5) but now it's part of longer body? Let's list:\n> \n> After move: head moves to (6,6), food eaten, so new positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)] – (5,5) was tail, but now it's not tail anymore? Original positions: [head: (6,5), body1: (6,4), body2: (5,4), tail: (5,5)]\n> \n> After moving Up to (6,6) and eating: head now at (6,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, but the tail moves? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. If no food eaten, tail position is removed. If food eaten, tail position is not removed, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In this case: before move, positions: segment 0: head (6,5), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (5,4), seg3: tail (5,5).\n> \n> Move head to (6,6). Since (6,6) has food, it is eaten, so after move: new head at (6,6), then seg1 moves to where head was, (6,5), seg2 moves to where seg1 was, (6,4), seg3 moves to where seg2 was, (5,4), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so new positions: [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,4) ]? No.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,6)\n> \n> - Seg1 (which was at (6,4)) moves to where head was, (6,5)\n> \n> - Seg2 (which was at (5,4)) moves to where seg1 was, (6,4)\n> \n> - Seg3 (tail at (5,5)) moves to where seg2 was, (5,4)\n> \n> But since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving, so at (5,5), but the tail moved to (5,4), so new segment at old tail position (5,5).\n> \n> Thus new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and new tail (5,5)? Let's list:\n> \n> - New segment 0: head at (6,6)\n> \n> - New segment 1: previous head, now body at (6,5)\n> \n> - New segment 2: previous seg1, now at (6,4)  // seg1 was at (6,4) and moved to (6,5)?

But (5,5) was occupied, now it's still there.\n> \n> Positions: (6,6) head, then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and (5,5). But (5,4) and (5,5) are both occupied, but (5,4) was seg2, now it's segment 3, and (5,5) is new segment 4.\n> \n> But (5,5) was previously occupied by tail, so moving away from it is fine, but now it's still occupied? No, when snake moves, the tail moves away from (5,5) to (5,4) if no growth, but with growth, tail stays at (5,5) only if we add new segment there.\n> \n> In the sequence: when head moves to new cell, if food, we add a new cell at the end, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is attached.\n> \n> Standard: after moving head to new position, if food, the tail remains where it is, so the segment that was tail is still there, and we add a new segment at that position, but it's the same as not moving the tail.\n> \n> For example, before move: head at A, body B, tail C.\n> \n> After move head to D (with food): new head D, body A, body B, tail C (and since food, new tail added at C, so now positions D, A, B, C, with C being the last body, and new tail at C? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have it: when snake eats, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments follow, but the tail does not advance; it stays, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After eating: [new_H, H, B1, B2, T]  // T remains, so now snake has segments at new_H, H, B1, B2, T. T is still there, so the cell is occupied.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,6): new head (6,6), then previous head (6,5), then (6,4), then (5,4), then tail (5,5) still there. So positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n> \n> But (5,5) was occupied, and now it's still occupied by the tail, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> At turn 9, head at (6,5), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (6,6): has food, so eat it, grow to length 5.\n> \n> - Left to (5,5): (5,5) is currently occupied by the tail. But according to rules, moving into tail is allowed because the tail will move away. But let's see the collision rules.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to (5,5), which is the tail, it should be ok because after move, the tail will move away.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, if I move Left to (5,5), no food there, so after move: head moves to (5,5), which was tail, then body segments move: seg1 moves to (6,5) (previous head), seg2 moves to (6,4) (previous seg1), seg3 (tail) moves to (5,4) (previous seg2).\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4).

It's turn 11. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6). The snake positions are: head at (5,6), then body segments at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), and tail at (5,4). The head is moving left, so from (5,6), it was going left to... wait, positions are given in order, so head is (5,6), next is (6,6), which is to the right, but head direction is L (left). That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> Let me plot this out. Snake positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]. Head is at (5,6), and the next segment is at (6,6), which is to the east (right) of (5,6). But the head direction is given as L, which is left. That doesn't make sense because if the head is at (5,6) and moving left, it should be going to (4,6) or something, but the previous position isn't given. The positions list is the current positions, so head at (5,6), and it was moving left to get there? But the next segment is at (6,6), which is right of head, so if head moved left to (5,6), the previous head position must have been (6,6), and it moved left to (5,6), so the body follows.\n> \n> Let's think carefully. The snake positions are listed from head to tail. So at turn 11, head is at (5,6). The head direction is the direction it moved to get to that position, I assume. So it moved left to (5,6), meaning it came from (6,6). Then the body segments: after head, it's (6,6), which is the previous head position, then (6,5), then (6,4), then tail at (5,4). So the snake body goes from (5,6) to (6,6) to (6,5) to (6,4) to (5,4). That means from (6,6) to (6,5) is down, from (6,5) to (6,4) is down, from (6,4) to (5,4) is left.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (5,6), and it just moved left, so current direction is L. For the next move, I can choose to go U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right), but I cannot instantly reverse, so since it just moved left, I cannot move right immediately. So possible moves from (5,6) are U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> Now, the grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells in each direction.

Value 1 each.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current, so on turn 14 it will disappear? Let's see: current turn 11, life span 3, so it appears for turn 11, 12, 13, and disappears at turn 14. Similarly, (5,1) life span 6, so disappears at turn 17, (2,6) life span 9, disappears at turn 20.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the current grid.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7. Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 is inside, similarly y from 1 to 6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7), etc. are all walls. Playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=1 to 6 is 6 cells, y=1 to 6 is 6 cells, so 6x6 grid, but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6). (3,6) is within x=3,y=6. y=6 is the top row? y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but here it doesn't specify, but since walls are y=0 and y=7, it should be consistent.\n> \n> Let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right, for example. But walls are at borders, so cells like (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6). (3,6) has y=6, which is one below y=7, so if y=7 is top wall, y=6 is playable, but with obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2), (5,1), (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head at (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), tail at (5,4).\n> \n> So let's sketch the grid:\n> \n> y=7: wall\n> \n> y=6: x=0 wall, x=1, x=2, x=3 obstacle? (3,6) is internal obstacle, so not playable. x=4, x=5: snake head (5,6), x=6: body (6,6), x=7 wall.\n> \n> y=5: x=0 wall, x=1, x=2, x=3, x=4, x=5, x=6: body (6,5), x=7 wall\n> \n> y=4: x=0 wall, x=1, x=2, x=3, x=4, x=5: tail? Tail is at (5,4), but body segments: from positions, (6,4) and (5,4). y=4: x=6 body (6,4), x=5 tail (5,4)\n> \n> Positions: (5,6) head, (6,6) body, (6,5) body, (6,4) body, (5,4) tail.\n> \n> So at y=6: x=5: head, x=6: body\n> \n> y=5: x=6: body (6,5)\n> \n> y=4: x=6: body (6,4), x=5: tail (5,4)\n> \n> Also, food: (3,2) at y=2,x=3; (5,1) at y=1,x=5; (2,6) at y=6,x=2.\n> \n> (2,6) is at y=6,x=2, but y=6 has x=2, which is not occupied by snake or obstacle yet? (3,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) is free, I think.\n> \n> List all cells:\n> \n> - Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n> \n> - Obstacle: (3,6)\n> \n> - Snake: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> - Food: (3,2), (5,1), (2,6)\n> \n> Current head at (5,6), direction L, so just moved left to (5,6) from (6,6).\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,6):\n> \n> - U: up to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: down to (5,5). Is (5,5) free? Snake positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). So (5,5) is not occupied, and not wall. (5,5) should be free.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,6). (4,6) is within bounds, x=4,y=6. Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacle is (3,6), not (4,6). And not occupied by snake.\n> \n> - R: right to (6,6), but (6,6) is occupied by body, and since the snake is moving, when head moves to a cell, if it's body, it collides unless it's the tail and tail moves away. But (6,6) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). (6,6) is the second segment, so if head moves to (6,6), it would collide with body. So R is invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move right because of no instant reverse? Head direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or L.

It's turn 12, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the grid is 8x8, but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the snake can be on x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Yes.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So the snake has 5 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning down, so last move was down to (5,5). Since head is at (5,5) and direction is D, that means it came from above, so previous position was (5,6)? Let's see the positions: [(5,5), (5,6), ...] – head is first, so (5,5) is head, then (5,6) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position.\n> \n> Since direction is D, moving down, to (5,5), so from (5,6) to (5,5) down. Yes.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,2), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current, so after turn 12, it has 2 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 13? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists for L more turns, including turn t.\n> \n> So for food at (3,2): life_span=2 at turn 12, so it exists on turn 12 and 13, disappears after turn 13, so not available on turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): life_span=5, exists from turn 12 to 16, disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> (2,6): life_span=8, exists from turn 12 to 19.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,5), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly.

Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> Moving D: to (5,4)\n> \n> Moving L: to (4,5)\n> \n> Moving R: to (6,5)\n> \n> But I need to check if these are valid, no walls or body collision except tail.\n> \n> First, walls: border walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so for (5,4): x=5, y=4, which is between 1 and 6, so ok. (4,5) same, (6,5) x=6, y=5, x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=5 not wall, so all are within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), not affecting these.\n> \n> Now, body collision: snake positions: head (5,5), body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> If I move D to (5,4): is (5,4) occupied? Current positions: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So (6,4) is the tail, and (5,4) is not occupied, so moving to (5,4) is safe for now.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake will grow only if I eat food, otherwise tail moves, so positions change.\n> \n> Similarly, move L to (4,5): (4,5) not in positions, so ok.\n> \n> Move R to (6,5): (6,5) is occupied by a body segment. Current positions: (6,5) is the fourth segment, not tail. Tail is (6,4).\n> \n> So moving to (6,5) would be head colliding with body, which is deadly. So I cannot move R to (6,5).\n> \n> Therefore, possible immediate moves: D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> (3,2) - value 1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 13 or it disappears.\n> \n> (5,1) - value 1, life span 5, can be eaten up to turn 16.\n> \n> (2,6) - value 1, life span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid risks, especially tail reward danger.\n> \n> First, let's find a path to eat food while surviving.\n> \n> Since (3,2) has short life, only 2 turns left, I should consider going for it if possible.\n> \n> From (5,5), to reach (3,2), it's 3 units left and 3 units down, but since I can only move one step per turn, and (3,2) is at turn 12, I need to eat it by turn 13.\n> \n> Turn 12: I move, then turn 13 I can eat it if I reach it.\n> \n> Distance: from (5,5) to (3,2) is Δx= -2, Δy= -3, so Manhattan distance 5, which is more than 1, so I cannot reach it in one move. I need multiple turns.\n> \n> Turn 12: I move somewhere.\n> \n> Then turn 13: I move again.\n> \n> To reach (3,2) by turn 13, I need to be at (3,2) on turn 13 action.\n> \n> After turn 12 move, I should be adjacent to (3,2) so that on turn 13 I can move to it.\n> \n> (3,2) adjacent cells: (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2)\n> \n> (3,1): y=1, which is not wall, y=1 is within 1 to 6.\n> \n> (3,3), (2,2), (4,2) all should be ok, but (3,1) is y=1, which is not border wall? Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.\n> \n> Similarly x=2,3,4 ok.\n> \n> Now, from current position (5,5), I need to be at one of these adjacent cells by end of turn 12? No.\n> \n> Turn 12 action: I move from (5,5) to a new position, say P.\n> \n> Then turn 13: I move from P to (3,2) if possible.\n> \n> So for turn 13 to move to (3,2), on turn 12 end, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (3,2), which are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2).\n> \n> But on turn 12, after my move, the snake head is at some position.\n> \n> Current turn 12: before move, head at (5,5).\n> \n> After move, head at new position.\n> \n> For example, if I move L to (4,5), then after turn 12, head at (4,5).\n> \n> Then from (4,5), to reach (3,2) on turn 13, I need to move to (3,2) directly, but (4,5) to (3,2) is not adjacent; Δx=-1, Δy=-3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so up/down/left/right one step.\n> \n> (4,5) to (3,2): not adjacent, distance too far.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D to (5,4), from (5,4) to (3,2) not adjacent.\n> \n> From (5,5), I cannot reach a position adjacent to (3,2) in one move because the adjacent cells are (3,1),(3,3),(2,2),(4,2), all of which are at least distance 2 from (5,5).\n> \n> For example, to (4,2): from (5,5) to (4,2) is Δx=-1, Δy=-3, distance 4.\n> \n> Min distance to an adjacent cell: e.g., to (4,2) is 3 steps away: say (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) but that's not to (4,2), to (4,2) from (5,5): could be (5,5)->(4,5)->(4,4)->(4,3)->(4,2), 4 steps? (5,5) to (4,5) left, then (4,5) to (4,4) down, then (4,4) to (4,3) down, then (4,3) to (4,2) down, but (4,2) is adjacent to (3,2)? (4,2) to (3,2) is left, yes adjacent.\n> \n> But from current position, to reach (4,2) takes 3 moves: to (4,5) in 1, but (4,5) to (4,2) is 3 down, so 4 moves total? Let's think Manhattan distance.\n> \n> (5,5) to (4,2): Δx=-1, Δy=-3, so |Δx| + |Δy| = 4, so at least 4 moves.\n> \n> Similarly, to (3,3): (5,5) to (3,3) Δx=-2, Δy=-2, distance 4.\n> \n> To (3,1): (5,5) to (3,1) Δx=-2, Δy=-4, distance 6.\n> \n> To (2,2): similar.\n> \n> So the closest adjacent cell to (3,2) is (4,2) at distance 4 from (5,5), or (3,3) at distance 4, etc.\n> \n> Since |Δx| + |Δy| = 4 for (4,2), it takes 4 moves to reach (4,2), but to be at a cell from which I can move to (3,2) on the next turn, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 13 start.\n> \n> Turn 13 action: I move to (3,2).\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn 13, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (3,2).\n> \n> But at beginning of turn 13, the head is at the position after turn 12 move.\n> \n> After turn 12 move, head is at new position, say H12.\n> \n> Then turn 13, I move from H12 to new position.\n> \n> To eat on turn 13, I need to move to (3,2) on turn 13 action, so H12 must be adjacent to (3,2).\n> \n> H12 is after turn 12 move.\n> \n> From current position (5,5), after one move, I can be at (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5) but (6,5) is invalid, so only (5,4) or (4,5).\n> \n> (5,4) to (3,2) is not adjacent, as |Δx|=2, |Δy|=2.\n> \n> (4,5) to (3,2) |Δx|=1, |Δy|=3, not adjacent.\n> \n> Neither is adjacent to (3,2). So I cannot reach (3,2) by turn 13.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 12, so it exists on turn 12 and 13, disappears after turn 13, so I can eat it on turn 12 or 13.\n> \n> But on turn 12, I am at (5,5), which is not (3,2), so I cannot eat it now.\n> \n> On turn 13, I need to be at (3,2) to eat it, but as above, I cannot be at (3,2) on turn 13 because from (5,5), even after one move, I am not close enough.\n> \n> After turn 12 move, I am at (5,4) or (4,5), both are at least distance 3 from (3,2), so I need turn 13 and turn 14 to reach, but on turn 14, the food is gone.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 12, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 13, meaning it is not there on turn 14.\n> \n> So I can only eat it on turn 12 or 13.\n> \n> Turn 12: I am not at (3,2), so cannot eat.\n> \n> Turn 13: to eat, I need to move to (3,2) on turn 13 action, so I need to be adjacent to it at start of turn 13, i.e., after turn 12 move.\n> \n> But after turn 12 move, I am at (5,4) or (4,5), neither adjacent to (3,2), and I cannot reach an adjacent cell in one move from here.\n> \n> For example, from (5,4), the adjacent cells are (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,4).

Let me confirm coordinates. Typically in grids, y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom, so moving down increases y? No, the movement definitions:\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) – so up increases y? That might be counterintuitive. Let's see the definition:\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`\" so U: (x, y+1) – if y+1 is up, that means y increases upwards, which is unusual. In standard grids, y often increases downward, but here it says U: (x,y+1), which might imply y=0 is bottom or top?\n> \n> The wall borders are given: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake positions: head at (5,4), moving down. If moving down is D: (x,y-1)? Let's check the definition.\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)`\"\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - U: y+1\n> \n> - D: y-1\n> \n> - L: x-1\n> \n> - R: x+1\n> \n> And walls at y=0 and y=7. Since D is y-1, moving down decreases y, so y=0 is probably the bottom row, and y=7 is the top row? That would mean moving up increases y towards top.\n> \n> But in standard, y=0 is often top. Let's think with coordinates.\n> \n> For example, snake body: (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6) to (6,5). Head at (5,4), moving down to (5,3)? But (5,5) is above (5,4) if y increases upwards? I'm confused.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), body next is (5,5). Since the list is head first, then body, so (5,4) is head, then (5,5) is the first body segment. Since head is moving down, and (5,5) is at same x, higher y? If U is (x,y+1), that means y+1 is upward, so higher y is upward.\n> \n> So let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. So moving U (up) to (x,y+1) increases y, moving D (down) to (x,y-1) decreases y.\n> \n> Thus, head at (5,4), moving down to (5,3) which is downward, y decreasing.\n> \n> Body segments: (5,5) at (5,5) which is above head, then (5,6) above that, then (6,6) right, then (6,5) down from there.\n> \n> So snake path: from (5,6) to (6,6) right, then to (6,5) down, head at (5,4) down from (5,5).\n> \n> Head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,3) – y-1\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,4)\n> \n> Cannot move up (U) because that would be opposite to current direction D, and no instant reverse is allowed. Current direction is D, so cannot move U to (5,5), which is occupied by body anyway.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (5,3): is it wall or body? Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (5,3) has y=3, not 0 or 7, x=5 not 0 or 7, and no internal wall there. Body segments: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). (5,3) not among them, so safe.\n> \n> - (4,4): x=4,y=4, not border, not internal obstacle (internal at (3,6)), not body, so safe.\n> \n> - (6,4): x=6,y=4, not border, not body, internal obstacle at (3,6), so safe.\n> \n> All possible moves are safe immediately.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. Turn t1=13, so after this turn, it might be gone if not eaten now.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 13, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So must be eaten on turn 13 to get it.\n> \n> But can I reach it? Head at (5,4), (3,2) is two steps away: need to move left to (4,4) then left to (3,4)? (3,2) is at x=3,y=2.\n> \n> From (5,4) to (3,2): shortest path is left twice and down twice, but I can only move one step per turn.\n> \n> To reach (3,2) this turn? Impossible, since it's two moves away. (5,4) to (3,2) is |5-3|=2 in x, |4-2|=2 in y, so Manhattan distance 4, I can't reach it in one turn. So I cannot eat it on turn 13; it will disappear after this turn, so it's gone forever. No point in going for it.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 13 means it will be there on turn 13, but if not eaten during turn 13, it disappears after. Since I can only eat when head moves onto it, and I'm not on it now, I can't eat it this turn, so it's wasted. Ignore (3,2).\n> \n> Other food:\n> \n> - (5,1): at (5,1), life span 4.

So it can be eaten on turns when life span >=1.\n> \n> For (5,1) at turn 13, life span 4, so can be eaten on turns 13,14,15,16.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 7, can be eaten turns 13 to 19.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 10, turns 13 to 22.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,4), I need to plan moves.\n> \n> Also, tail position: snake positions [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)] so tail is at (6,5).\n> \n> After moving, the tail will move, but when eating, length increases, so tail stays or moves depending.\n> \n> But for now, let's consider possible actions for turn 13.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n> \n> I should think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for visualization.\n> \n> Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6.

Head direction is down (D), which means it was moving downward to reach (5,3) from (5,4) in the previous move? Let me think about the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. Since head is at (5,3) and direction is D, that means it moved down to (5,3). But (5,4) is above (5,3), so if head was at (5,4) and moved down to (5,3), that makes sense. Then (5,4) is the first body segment.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn. So on turn 14, life span 4 means it will be there for turns 14,15,16,17, and disappear after turn 17? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 14, life span 4, it will be present until the end of turn 17, and disappear before turn 18. Similarly, (2,6) life span 6: present until end of turn 19 (since 14+6-1=19?

Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right. Cannot move up because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, which is up, so I cannot move up next. Allowed moves: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. Walls at borders, so grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> So grid is 6x6, from (1,1) to (6,6), but (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6).

Or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think. Standard in such games, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) — so increasing y is up.\n> \n> D (x,y-1) — decreasing y is down.\n> \n> L (x-1,y)\n> \n> R (x+1,y)\n> \n> So, y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall? Walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Playable y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row above bottom wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, x=1 to 6 playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (3,6): (3,6) is top row, since y=6 is top.\n> \n> Snake: positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3) — x=5, y=3\n> \n> - Body: (5,4) y=4\n> \n> - (5,5) y=5\n> \n> - (5,6) y=6\n> \n> - Tail: (6,6) x=6,y=6\n> \n> So the snake is mostly vertical at x=5, from y=3 to y=6, but tail is at (6,6), so it's like a corner.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,1): x=5,y=1 — directly below head at (5,3), since down to (5,2) then (5,1)\n> \n> - (2,6): x=2,y=6 — top row, left\n> \n> - (4,1): x=4,y=1 — bottom row, left of (5,1)\n> \n> Now, head direction is D (down), so from previous position. Since head is at (5,3) and direction D, it came from (5,4) down to (5,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - D: down to (5,2)\n> \n> - L: left to (4,3)\n> \n> - R: right to (6,3)\n> \n> Cannot move U (up) to (5,4) because it's the body and also instant reverse, but (5,4) is directly above and is a body segment, so moving up would cause collision immediately, but also it's illegal because of no reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food and avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's see the food at (5,1). It's close, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 17. We can eat it by moving down twice: to (5,2) then to (5,1). But need to consider if it's safe.\n> \n> Also, (4,1) is nearby, life span 9, so not urgent.\n> \n> (2,6) is far, life span 6, so we have time.\n> \n> But there's a danger: if we move down to (5,2), then to (5,1), we eat the food, snake grows, so new tail will be added.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake length increases, so we need space.\n> \n> Also, special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (6,6), head is at (5,3), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, y differ by 1 or same y, x differ by 1. (5,3) and (6,6) are not adjacent; |dx|=1, |dy|=3, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's consider moving towards (5,1).\n> \n> But if we move down to (5,2), what is the state?\n> \n> Turn 14: move to (5,2). Then snake positions: head at (5,2), body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), tail at (6,6)? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten yet, moving to (5,2): new head (5,2), then body: previous head (5,3) becomes first body, then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), and tail (6,6) moves to where? The segment that was at (5,6) moves to where the next segment was? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ]\n> \n> After moving down to (5,2): new head (5,2), then the body segments follow: the first body is the previous head position (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), and the tail (6,6) is removed? No: in snake, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed from its position.\n> \n> So after moving to (5,2): positions: head (5,2), body: (5,3) [previous head], (5,4) [was first body], (5,5) [was second body], (5,6) [was third body], and the tail was at (6,6), but since no eating, the segment that was at (5,6) moves to where? List indices.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (5,3), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,6), 4: tail (6,6)\n> \n> After move, new head at (5,2) (since moved down), then segment 1 moves to position of old head (5,3), segment 2 moves to position of segment 1 (5,4), segment 3 moves to position of segment 2 (5,5), segment 4 moves to position of segment 3 (5,6). The old position of segment 4 (6,6) is now empty.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,2), body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Tail is at (5,6), but (5,6) is the last body segment.\n> \n> Positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) ] — and (6,6) is free now.\n> \n> Length is still 5.\n> \n> Now, if we then move down again to (5,1), we eat the food at (5,1), so snake grows: new head at (5,1), body: previous head (5,2) becomes first body, then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), and since we ate food, we add a new segment at the previous tail position, so tail remains at (5,6)? After eating, the tail doesn't move; we add a new segment at the end.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, the head moves to food, the body segments move as usual, but instead of removing the tail, we keep it, so length increases.\n> \n> So after moving to (5,1) and eating: new head at (5,1), body: (5,2) [previous head], (5,3) [was first body], (5,4) [was second], (5,5) [was third], and (5,6) [was tail, now new segment], so positions: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) — length 6.\n> \n> Now, is this safe? After this, head at (5,1), which is bottom row. Possible moves: since we moved down to (5,1), direction is D.\n> \n> Then we can move L to (4,1), or R to (6,1), or U to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, so collision if we move up?

I think it's better to think that on turn t, if life span is N, it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span is N, meaning it has N turns left including current turn. So after N turns, it's gone.

From the positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), which is right of head, but since head direction is left, it makes sense because the head moved left to (4,3) from previous position, which should be (5,3) but now (5,3) is the first body segment. Snake positions are [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)].

New head (5,1). Then the previous positions: old head was (5,2), so it becomes the first body segment at (5,2). Old body1 was at (4,2), becomes second body at (4,2). Old body2 at (4,3), becomes third body at (4,3). Old body3 at (5,3), becomes fourth body at (5,3). Old body4 at (5,4), becomes fifth body at (5,4).

It's turn 16, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it's moving towards decreasing y, so from (4,2) to (4,3) would be down if y increases upwards? Let me clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is the bottom, and y increases upwards, but in this context, since moving U is (x,y+1), that means y increases as you go up. So U: y+1, D: y-1, L: x-1, R: x+1. So head is at (4,2), direction D, so it was moving down to (4,1)? Positions are given as [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]. If head is at (4,2) and direction is D, that means it was previously at a higher y, so moving down to lower y. But the next segment is (4,3), which has higher y, so that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed head first: (4,2) is head, then (4,3) is the first body segment, then (5,3), etc. But if direction is D, meaning moving down (y decreasing), how is the head at (4,2) and the next segment at (4,3), which is y=3, higher than 2? That would imply the snake was moving up, not down.\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", and D is down, (x,y-1). But from the positions, head at (4,2), and the segment behind it is (4,3), which is at y=3. Since y increases up, (4,3) is above (4,2), so if the snake is moving, the head should be moving away from the body. If direction is D, down, meaning from a higher y to lower y, but here head is at (4,2) and body at (4,3), so the head must have moved down to (4,2) from, say, (4,3) or something. Let's see the sequence: positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]. So the head is at (4,2), and the neck is at (4,3). Since the snake is moving, the head was previously at (4,3) or adjacent. If direction is D, and it moved to (4,2), that means before turn, head was at (4,3), and it moved down to (4,2). But (4,3) is now the first body segment. Similarly, before that, it might have been at (5,3) or something.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current direction it's facing, meaning the last move was in that direction. So on turn 15, head was at (4,3), moved D to (4,2) on turn 16. But on turn 16, the positions are given as head at (4,2), so it has just moved there. The direction D indicates that it just moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, for movement, I can choose to move U, D, L, R from current position, but with no instant reverse, so since it just moved D (down), I cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be reverse. So possible moves from (4,2) are D (down to y=1), L (left to x=3), or R (right to x=5). Cannot move U to (4,3) because that's reverse and not allowed.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,2)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,3) - but (4,3) is occupied by the snake's body, and also it's reverse direction, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - D: to (4,1) - this might be possible, but need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> - L: to (3,2)\n> \n> - R: to (5,2)\n> \n> But (5,2) might be occupied or not? Snake positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So (5,2) is not occupied by snake, I think. Let's list all occupied cells: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So (5,2) is free, (4,1) is free, (3,2) is free.\n> \n> Also, walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would be wall collision. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Current head (4,2), y=2, so y=1 and y=0 are below. y=0 is wall, so moving D to (4,1) is possible since y=1 is not wall, only y=0 is wall. Similarly, x=4, x=3 and x=5 are within 1 to 6, I think x from 0 to 7, so x=3,4,5 are fine.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=3,4,5 are safe.\n> \n> Now food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food have value 1, so all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So on turn 16, life span 2, so after turn 16, it will have life span 1, then after turn 17, life span 0, gone. So it can be eaten on turn 16 or 17.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 4, so available for 4 turns including turn 16.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 7, available longer.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 10, available longest.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current snake: head at (4,2), body at (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So it's like the snake has a bend; from head down to (4,2), then the neck at (4,3) which is above, so the snake came from up, moved down to (4,2), so it's facing down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - D to (4,1): this is down, to y=1. (4,1) has food! (4,1) is one of the food positions, with life span 7, value 1.\n> \n> - L to (3,2): left to x=3,y=2. No food there.\n> \n> - R to (5,2): right to x=5,y=2. No food there, but (5,1) is below, which has food.\n> \n> Also, moving D to (4,1) would eat the food there, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> But I need to consider the risks.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,1), I eat the food at (4,1). Then snake grows, so new head at (4,1), and tail stays, so positions become: head (4,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). And since I ate food, length increases, so tail doesn't move. So body segments: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Length 6 now.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so the new segment is added at head position.\n> \n> Then next turn, when I move, the tail will move.\n> \n> But for now, on turn 16, if I move to (4,1) and eat, snake becomes longer.\n> \n> But is there any danger? After moving to (4,1), head is at (4,1), which is adjacent to borders? y=1, not y=0, so no wall. But is it safe for future moves?\n> \n> Also, there's the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (5,5), far away, no issue.\n> \n> Now, other moves: if I move L to (3,2), then no food eaten, head at (3,2), body follows, so tail at (5,4) or something? When I move, the tail moves forward, so positions: head to (3,2), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, but since no food eaten, tail moves, so the last segment (5,5) is removed, and new head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Length same.\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (5,2), head to (5,2), then body: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and tail (5,5) removed? Positions: after move, head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Since no food, tail (5,5) is not there anymore; the snake moves, so the last position is removed.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> With eating, head moves to food, new segment added, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,1), I eat food, grow to length 6.\n> \n> Then for next turn, head at (4,1), direction D (since I moved down).\n> \n> From (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) - but (4,2) is now occupied by body? After eating, positions: head (4,1), body segments: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So (4,2) is occupied, so cannot move up to (4,2), it's a body collision.\n> \n> Also, direction is D, so moving U is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - D to (4,0): but y=0 is wall, so collision, death.\n> \n> - L to (3,1): (3,1) has food? Food at (3,1) is present, life span 10.\n> \n> - R to (5,1): (5,1) has food with life span 2.\n> \n> Now, (3,1) and (5,1) both have food.\n> \n> But if I move to (3,1) or (5,1), I might eat food, but need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> First, if I move L to (3,1) from (4,1), I eat food at (3,1), grow again.\n> \n> Then snake head at (3,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Length 7.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), I need to move. Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But direction: I moved L, so last direction L.\n> \n> Cannot move R (reverse).\n> \n> U to (3,2): might be free? Currently, after moving to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So (3,2) is not occupied, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (3,0): y=0 wall, death.\n> \n> L to (2,1): x=2,y=1, possible.\n> \n> R not allowed.\n> \n> But (3,2) might be free.\n> \n> If I move to (3,1), then from there, I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n> \n> (3,2) is free now, since snake was only at (4,2), etc., not (3,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) free.\n> \n> But if I move U to (3,2), no food, or L to (2,1), no food.\n> \n> But after eating, I'm at (3,1), which is cornered, y=1, x=3.\n> \n> If I go to (3,2), then from there I can go to other places.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; first decision.\n> \n> Similarly, if from (4,1) I move R to (5,1), eat food at (5,1), grow, head at (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Length 7.\n> \n> Then from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, occupied, R to (6,1) possible if within bounds.\n> \n> x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so x=6 ok.\n> \n> Direction: moved R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n> \n> So U to (5,2), or R to (6,1), or D to (5,0) wall.\n> \n> (5,2) is free? After positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So (5,2) not occupied, yes.\n> \n> (6,1) free.\n> \n> But if I go to (5,2), no food, or (6,1), no food.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 16, if I don't move to (4,1), but go left or right.\n> \n> For example, move L to (3,2) on turn 16.\n> \n> Then no food eaten, head to (3,2), body follows: tail (5,5) removed, so positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4).

Length 6.\n> \n> Then from (5,1), as before.\n> \n> Now, I need to think long-term. Also, there is food at (2,6) with life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 19 (since turn 16 life span 4, after turn 16:3, turn17:2, turn18:1, turn19:0 gone). So I can eat it on turn 16,17,18,19 if possible.\n> \n> But (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, which is far from current position (4,2).\n> \n> Current position (4,2), (2,6) is left and up, but there's an obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Also, the snake body is around (4,3),(5,3), etc.\n> \n> To reach (2,6), I need to go left and up.\n> \n> But with the internal obstacle at (3,6), that might block the path.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Obstacle at (3,6), so to go to (2,6), I can access it from left or below, but since (3,6) blocked, I might need to go via y=5 or something.\n> \n> (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, and (3,6) is wall, so (2,6) can be reached from (2,5) or (1,6) or (2,7) but y=7 wall, so from (2,5) or (1,6).\n> \n> But (1,6) is x=1,y=6, which might be ok.\n> \n> From current position, it might take several moves.\n> \n> Also, food at (5,1) life span 2, so only available for this turn and next turn (turn 16 and 17).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life span 7, longer, (3,1) life span 10, very long.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 4, available for 4 turns.\n> \n> I need to prioritize survival, so avoid getting trapped.\n> \n> If I eat the food at (4,1) now, I go to (4,1), which is risky because from there, I can only move L or R, since U is body and D is wall. And both L and R have food, but if I eat one, say (3,1) or (5,1), I grow larger, and then from there, I might be more trapped.\n> \n> For example, if I eat (4,1) on turn 16, then on turn 17, if I move L to (3,1), eat again, then at (3,1), now I have a long snake, and from (3,1), I can only move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1), since D wall and R not possible or body.\n> \n> After eating (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So from (3,1), U to (3,2): (3,2) is free, I think, no snake there. D to (3,0) wall. L to (2,1) free.

Typically in such grids, coordinates from 0 to 7 mean 8 cells, but since borders are walls, the playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls and cannot be moved to.

Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1).

No, let's read.\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`\" so if U is (x,y+1), that means y+1 increases the y-coordinate, which might be moving up if (0,0) is bottom-left, but in standard computer graphics, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward.\n> \n> I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> And walls at y=0 and y=7, etc.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3). Since positions are head first, and head direction is D (down), meaning it moved to (4,1) from (4,2), so from (4,2) to (4,1) is down, so decreasing y.\n> \n> Therefore, U (x,y+1) increases y, which is downward if (0,0) is top-left.

It's turn 18, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a corner wall, etc. Walls are at the borders and one internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,1), then body segments at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (5,1) from previous position? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,1)  // which is left of head, so head moved right to (5,1), but previous position was (4,1), so from (4,1) to (5,1) is right, yes.\n> \n> - Segment 2: (4,2)  // below (4,1)? (4,1) to (4,2) is down? Positions: (5,1) head, then (4,1), which is left, then (4,2) which is down from (4,1), then (4,3) down from (4,2), then (5,3) right from (4,3)? Let's plot this.\n> \n> Write coordinates:\n> \n> - (5,1)  // head\n> \n> - (4,1)  // body, left of head\n> \n> - (4,2)  // body, below (4,1)\n> \n> - (4,3)  // body, below (4,2)\n> \n> - (5,3)  // body, right of (4,3)\n> \n> - (5,4)  // body, above (5,3)? (5,3) to (5,4) is up\n> \n> - (5,5)  // body, above (5,4)\n> \n> So the snake is like: from head at (5,1), goes left to (4,1), then down to (4,2), down to (4,3), then right to (5,3), then up to (5,4), up to (5,5). So it's a bit twisted.\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning it just moved right to (5,1), so from (4,1) to (5,1) was right move.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - Food at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 18, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 19? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after (t + L - 1)? For example, at turn t, if life span is N, after N turns it's gone, meaning it exists for N more turns including current? The description says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it means it will disappear after L more turns. So after L turns, at the start of turn t+L, it's gone.\n> \n> But when we say \"disappears after N turns\", it might mean after N turns from now.\n> \n> Let's see the state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (2,6,2,1)\" so (x,y, life_span, value)\n> \n> So at turn 18, (2,6) has life_span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns. So it exists on turn 18 and 19, and disappears at the start of turn 20 or something. But for movement, we care about when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) with value 1, life span 8, so it will last longer.\n> \n> Value: both are +1, since value is 1, and it says positive food has value +1, negative has -1, but here both are 1, so both positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

Is (6,1) safe? x=6, y=1. Borders: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border, y=1 not border. Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so x=6,y=1 is free. Also, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,1) head, (4,1), (4,2), etc. (6,1) is not in the list, so empty. Also not obstacle. So (6,1) is free. Moving to (6,1) would be safe for this turn.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Move up to (5,2). (5,2): is it free? y=2, x=5. Not border, not in snake positions: snake has (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (5,2) is not there, so free. Also not obstacle.\n> \n> Move down to (5,0)? y=0 is wall, so (5,0) is wall, cannot move down. Down from (5,1) would be (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid move. So D is not possible.\n> \n> Head at (5,1), moving down would be to (5,0), which is y=0, border wall, so collision, death. So down is not possible.\n> \n> Available moves: U (to (5,2)), R (to (6,1)), or D but D is invalid, so only U and R.\n> \n> D to (5,0) is wall, so only U and R possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) and (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is close to head at (5,1). (5,1) to (3,1) is left, but I cannot move left directly because of reverse rule.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is at top, y=6.\n> \n> Life span: (2,6) has life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 19? At turn 18, life span 2, after 2 turns it disappears. Since countdown includes current turn, after turn 18 and 19, at turn 20 it should be gone. So it can be eaten on turn 18 or 19.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) has life span 8, so it will last until turn 25 or so.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about survival and eating food.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (5,5), and head is at (5,1), so they are not adjacent; (5,5) to (5,1) is 4 cells apart vertically.\n> \n> But there might be food under the snake? Let's check.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,6) and (3,1), neither is under snake body, I think. Snake is at (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Food at (2,6) and (3,1), both not in these positions, so no food under snake to worry about.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for 5+ turns.\n> \n> But the action sequence should be for immediate turns, starting from turn 18.\n> \n> The answer format says: Action Sequence for turns t1, t1+1, etc., and I need to specify actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> But how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the sequence might not be fixed, I need to plan a path.\n> \n> Since the grid is small, I can simulate possible moves.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current:\n> \n> Turn 18: from (5,1), head dir R, can move U or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2):\n> \n> - Then head at (5,2), and the snake moves, so tail moves away from (5,5)? When snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> After moving to (5,2), new positions: head at (5,2), then previous head (5,1) becomes body, so body: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Tail at (5,4) now? Original positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)] 7 segments.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, and tail is removed. So if head moves to (5,2), new positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] and (5,5) is removed, so tail at (5,4).\n> \n> If I move R to (6,1), new positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to think about reaching food.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) is close. (3,1) is at x=3,y=1. Current head (5,1), so to reach (3,1), I need to go left twice: to (4,1) then to (3,1). But (4,1) is currently occupied by body, but when I move, it might free up.\n> \n> Currently, (4,1) is body segment. If I move away, it might become available later.\n> \n> But I cannot move left from (5,1) because of reverse rule.\n> \n> So to reach (3,1), I need to go up or right first, then come back.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,6) is at top, with short life span.\n> \n> (2,6) has only 2 turns left, including turn 18. So it can be eaten on turn 18 or 19; if not eaten by turn 19, it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 18: I can move, but I'm at (5,1), (2,6) is far, I can't reach in one move.\n> \n> Distance: from (5,1) to (2,6), |dx|=3, |dy|=5, min moves 8, but not directly, but in grid, Manhattan distance is 8, so impossible to reach in 1 or 2 moves. I need to move towards it.\n> \n> But life span 2, so after this turn and next, it will be gone. Turn 18: if I move, on turn 18 I can't reach (2,6). Turn 19: if I am closer, I might reach, but from (5,1) to (2,6) is 7 moves min? |5-2|=3 in x, |1-6|=5 in y, so min 8 moves, but since I can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal moves, each move changes x or y by 1, so Manhattan distance is |Δx| + |Δy| = 3 + 5 = 8 moves. From turn 18, I have moves on turn 18 and 19 to eat it, but in two moves, I can only reduce distance by 2, so at best, after two moves, I can be at distance 6, not at (2,6), so I cannot eat (2,6) at all because it disappears after turn 19. Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> At turn 18, life span is 2. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So after turn 18, life span becomes 1; after turn 19, life span becomes 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 18 or turn 19 if the head moves to that cell.\n> \n> But to eat on turn 18, I need to be at (2,6) now, but I'm at (5,1), not possible.\n> \n> To eat on turn 19, I need to move to (2,6) on turn 19.\n> \n> But from current position (5,1), I need to reach (2,6) in one move? No, on turn 19, I move from my position at the start of turn 19 to (2,6).\n> \n> At start of turn 18, I am at (5,1). After my move on turn 18, I am at new position, say P.\n> \n> Then at start of turn 19, I am at P, and I can move to adjacent cell.\n> \n> To be at (2,6) on turn 19, I need to be adjacent to (2,6) at the start of turn 19, so that I can move to it.\n> \n> So at start of turn 19, my head must be at one of: (1,6), (2,5), (2,7), (3,6), but y=7 is wall, x=1,2,3 y=5,6.\n> \n> (2,7) is y=7, wall, invalid. (1,6) x=1,y=6, (2,5) x=2,y=5, (3,6) x=3,y=6.\n> \n> But (3,6) is internal obstacle, so not accessible. So possible adjacent cells: (1,6), (2,5), and (2,7) invalid, (3,6) invalid, so only (1,6) and (2,5).\n> \n> (1,6) is x=1,y=6, not border, since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,6) is free except for obstacles, but no obstacle there.\n> \n> (2,5) x=2,y=5 free.\n> \n> So to eat on turn 19, I need to be at (1,6) or (2,5) at start of turn 19.\n> \n> Currently at turn 18 start, I am at (5,1).\n> \n> After turn 18 move, I will be at one of the possible positions from current move.\n> \n> Current possible moves: U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2) on turn 18, then at start turn 19, I am at (5,2).\n> \n> From (5,2), to reach (1,6) or (2,5) in one move? (5,2) to (1,6) is |5-1|=4, |2-6|=4, not adjacent. Similarly to (2,5) |5-2|=3, |2-5|=3, not adjacent. So from (5,2), I cannot reach (2,6) in one move; min distance 8 to (2,6), but to the adjacent cells, (1,6) is at distance |5-1| + |2-6| =4+4=8, not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (6,1) on turn 18, at turn 19 start at (6,1). To (1,6) or (2,5): |6-1|=5, |1-6|=5 to (1,6), not adjacent; to (2,5) |6-2|=4, |1-5|=4, not adjacent.\n> \n> So in both cases, after one move, I am too far to reach an adjacent cell to (2,6) in the next move. Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (2,6) at all; it will disappear without being eaten. So I should ignore this food and focus on the other one or long-term survival.\n> \n> (3,1) has longer life span, so I can go for that.\n> \n> But (3,1) is at (3,1), which is close.\n> \n> Current head (5,1), food at (3,1), so distance |5-3|=2 in x, same y, so I can reach it in two moves if I go left.\n> \n> But I cannot move left directly from (5,1) because head dir R, reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So I need to move up or right first, then left.\n> \n> But moving away might make it harder.\n> \n> Let's think about the path.\n> \n> First, I need to survive and have space.\n> \n> The snake body is mostly on the left and down, so the area around (5,1) has some body cells.\n> \n> Available moves: U or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2), then head at (5,2), body at (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Tail was (5,5), removed, so positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). (5,4) is tail? From above: after move, segments: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Yes, 7 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Now from (5,2), head position, direction? I moved up, so head dir is U now.\n> \n> Then possible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, collision; D to (5,1), but (5,1) is now body, collision; L to (4,2), but (4,2) is body; R to (6,2), which might be free.\n> \n> (6,2): x=6,y=2, not border, not in current body positions: body at (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). (6,2) not there, so free.\n> \n> Also, moving to (6,2) is possible since not reverse? Head dir U, moving R is not opposite, opposite would be D, but D is to (5,1) which is body, not possible anyway.\n> \n> Head dir after move U is up, so I can move U, D, L, R except opposite which is D.\n> \n> But D to (5,1) is body, collision; U to (5,3) is body; L to (4,2) is body; only R to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2) on turn 18, then on turn 19, I can only move R to (6,2), because all other directions are blocked by body.\n> \n> Then at (6,2), new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), tail at (5,3)? After move to (6,2), head (6,2), previous head (5,2) becomes body, so body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), and tail (5,4) removed?

Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (5,2), 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4)\n> \n> After move right to (6,2): new head at (6,2). Then the body segments follow: segment 1 (was index 0) moves to where head was, but head was index 0, so the body moves to the previous positions.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: new head position, then the tail end is cut off if no food eaten.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,2), then the previous head (5,2) becomes the first body segment, then (5,1), then (4,1), then (4,2), then (4,3), then (5,3). The last segment (5,4) is removed since no food.\n> \n> So new snake: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Tail is now (5,3).\n> \n> And direction becomes R.\n> \n> Now, for turn 19, I must move right, as it's the only safe move.\n> \n> But the food at (2,6) has life span 1, so I can only eat it on turn 19, but I'm at (5,2), and (2,6) is far away; I can't reach it in one move, so I miss it.

Snake has (5,1) at x=5,y=1, but (6,1) is x=6,y=1, not occupied. And food is at (6,1), which is positive food. Also not wall.\n> \n> - Right: (7,2) - but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> - Left: (5,2) - but (5,2) is occupied by the first body segment.

So 8 segments, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Direction down.\n> \n> If I go U to (6,3), no food, so snake moves: head to (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (5,3) removed, so 7 segments, tail now (4,3).\n> \n> Direction up.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (3,1), which is closer.\n> \n> (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is currently occupied? No, snake has (4,1) and (5,1), but (3,1) is free?

(6,2) and (5,3) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing edge, so (6,2) neighbors: (6,1), (6,3), (5,2), (7,2). (5,3) is diagonal? No, (x,y) adjacent: same x, y±1 or same y, x±1.\n> \n> So (6,2) and (5,3): x different, y different, so not adjacent.

It's turn 20. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, since x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let me confirm: walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid is 1 to 6 in x and 1 to 6 in y? x from 1 to 6 is 6 cells, but since walls are at 0 and 7, the valid x coordinates should be 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But (3,6) is given as internal obstacle, and y=6 is not a border? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=1 to y=6 should be playable, but (3,6) is an obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,2), then body segments: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3). So let's list the snake: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)].

The description says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 20, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 26? Let's see: if current turn is t, and life span N, it disappears after N-1 more turns? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), it becomes 0, so it disappears at the start of turn t + N?

Turn t to t + (N-1).\n> \n> Disappears after N turns, meaning after turn t + N -1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span N. After turn t, it has life span N-1. It can be eaten as long as life span >0. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, before action, life span is N. After the turn, if not eaten, life span becomes N-1 for next turn.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on any turn when life span >=1.\n> \n> For (3,1) at turn 20, life span 7, so it can be eaten from turn 20 to turn 26 (since turn 20: life 7, turn 21: life 6, ..., turn 26: life 1, turn 27: life 0, disappears).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 9, can be eaten from turn 20 to turn 28.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,2), direction R (right). So from (6,2), possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so cannot move left. Can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, the grid: walls at borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (3,6).

Standard snake movement: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell. When food eaten, head moves to food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> Specifically: when moving to a food cell, the head moves to that cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment. The new tail position is the same as the previous tail.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is (5,3).\n> \n> If I move to (6,1), which has food, so new head at (6,1), the body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,2) becomes the new neck at (6,2), then (5,2) to (5,2)? Let's list the new positions.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (6,1).\n> \n> Then the previous head (6,2) becomes the first body segment.\n> \n> Then the next segment (5,2) becomes (5,2), but since the head moved down, the body follows.\n> \n> New positions: head at (6,1)\n> \n> Then the old head (6,2) is now body segment 1.\n> \n> Then old body segment 1: (5,2) is now body segment 2.\n> \n> Old body segment 2: (5,1) is now body segment 3.\n> \n> Old body segment 3: (4,1) is now body segment 4.\n> \n> Old body segment 4: (4,2) is now body segment 5.\n> \n> Old body segment 5: (4,3) is now body segment 6.\n> \n> Old body segment 6: (5,3) is the tail, and since food eaten, it doesn't move, so tail is still at (5,3), and we add a new segment? No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail itself doesn't move, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Standard: the positions: after moving head to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to new cell, then segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1 position, and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> If no food eaten, the tail moves off its position.\n> \n> If food eaten, the tail stays, so the last position is kept, and the snake has an additional segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions list:\n> \n> Current positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg_k, tail]\n> \n> After moving to a non-food cell: new head at new position, new seg1 at old head, new seg2 at old seg1, ..., new tail at old seg_k (the last body segment before tail).\n> \n> The tail is the last element.\n> \n> In this list: positions[0] = head, positions[1] = first body segment, ..., positions[6] = tail for a 7-segment snake?

It's turn 21, and I'm the snake AI. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So the playable grid is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But there's also an internal obstacle at (3,6). So I need to avoid that too.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,6)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So that's 7 segments. Head is at (6,3) and direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Current head direction: U, so from (6,3), moving up would go to (6,4), but let's list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,2)  // directly below head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,3)  // tail\n> \n> Positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n> \n> So the tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,1), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn. So after turn 21 + 6 = turn 27, it will disappear if not eaten. Similarly, (6,1) life span 8, disappears after turn 21 + 8 = turn 29.\n> \n> But since we're at turn 21, the life span decreases each turn, so for (3,1), at turn 21, life span 6, so it has 6 turns left including this one. After turn 21, it will have 5 left, and so on, until turn 26 it has 1 left, and on turn 27 it disappears. Similarly for the other.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (6,3), moving up (U). So possible moves: I can go U, L, R, but not D because that would be reverse, and direction is U, so I can't go D instantly. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D on the next turn. But I can move L or R or continue U.\n> \n> Possible actions from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: to (6,4)\n> \n> - D: but cannot, since opposite direction\n> \n> - L: to (5,3)\n> \n> - R: to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. R from (6,3) would be to (7,3), but x=7 is wall, so I cannot move right.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (6,2) is where the body is, but let's see.\n> \n> Current positions: (6,3) head, (6,2) is segment, so (6,2) is occupied by body, so moving to (6,2) would cause collision, since it's not the tail? The tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, if head goes to tail, and tail moves away, it's ok, but only if it's the current tail position before move.\n> \n> Movement: when I move, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, and the tail moves away, it should be fine, as long as no other body part is there.\n> \n> But in this case, from (6,3), moving down to (6,2): (6,2) is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, the head would be at (6,2), and the tail will move to (4,2) or something? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current snake: positions: index 0: head (6,3), 1: (6,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2), 6: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,2):\n> \n> - New head position: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then body: segment 1 moves to where head was, (6,3)? No.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves first to the new cell. Then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So after move down:\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,2) — but (6,2) was previously occupied by segment 1, so now head is there, and segment 1 will move to the old head position (6,3).\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (6,2)? No.\n> \n> Let's think of the positions shifting.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> - Pos[0] = (6,3) head\n> \n> - Pos[1] = (6,2)\n> \n> - Pos[2] = (5,2)\n> \n> - Pos[3] = (5,1)\n> \n> - Pos[4] = (4,1)\n> \n> - Pos[5] = (4,2)\n> \n> - Pos[6] = (4,3) tail\n> \n> After move down to (6,2):\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,2)\n> \n> - Then, segment 1 moves to pos[0] old, which is (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to pos[1] old, which is (6,2) — but (6,2) is now occupied by head? No, the positions are updated sequentially.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when head moves, the tail end is removed if no food eaten, but here, since we're moving, and no food, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (which was at (6,2)) moves to where head was, (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (5,2)) moves to where segment 1 was, (6,2) — but (6,2) is now the head? Confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second to the old first body position, and so on, and the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So after moving down to (6,2):\n> \n> - New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,2)  // new position\n> \n> - Segment 1: moves to old head position (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: moves to old segment 1 position (6,2) — but (6,2) is the new head position? No: when we say \"moves to\", it's the cell.\n> \n> At the start, positions are:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Seg1: (6,2)\n> \n> - Seg2: (5,2)\n> \n> - Seg3: (5,1)\n> \n> - Seg4: (4,1)\n> \n> - Seg5: (4,2)\n> \n> - Tail: (4,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2):\n> \n> - The cell (6,2) was occupied by seg1, but now head moves there.\n> \n> Then, seg1 must move to the old position of head, which is (6,3)\n> \n> Then seg2 must move to the old position of seg1, which was (6,2) — but (6,2) is now the new head, so seg2 moves to (6,2)? But (6,2) is occupied? No, at the time of move, the cells are updated.\n> \n> In terms of collision, the head moves to a cell, and if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides. But if it's the tail, and the tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,2): (6,2) is currently occupied by seg1, which is not the tail. The tail is at (4,3). So moving to (6,2) would cause the head to collide with seg1, which is not allowed. Even though after the move, seg1 moves away, but at the moment of move, the cell is occupied, so it's a collision.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

The tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to head, so not an option.\n> \n> From (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,4) - is this free? Let's see what's there. Currently, no food mentioned at (6,4), and not occupied by snake except head. Snake positions: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So (6,4) is empty, I assume, unless wall or food.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (6,4) is within x=1-6, y=1-6, and no internal obstacle, so should be free.\n> \n> - L: to (5,3) - is (5,3) occupied? Snake has (5,2), (5,1), etc, not (5,3), so free.\n> \n> - R: to (7,3) - but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (6,2) - occupied by segment 1, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from current position: U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, so I can continue U or change to L or R, but R is invalid, so only U or L.\n> \n> Now, food: there is food at (3,1) and (6,1).\n> \n> (6,1): is that occupied? Snake has (5,1) and (4,1), but (6,1) is not listed, so it's free, with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) has food.\n> \n> Now, life span: (3,1) has life span 6, meaning at turn 21, it has 6 turns left, so disappears after turn 26? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for (3,1), life span 6 at turn 21, so after turn 21, at start of turn 22, life span becomes 5, and so on, until turn 26, life span 1, after turn 26, at start of turn 27, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 26 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 8, disappears after turn 28, can be eaten from turn 21 to 28.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate move: turn 21, I can go U or L.\n> \n> If I go U to (6,4), then head is at (6,4), direction U.\n> \n> If I go L to (5,3), then head at (5,3), direction L.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,1) is close, but to reach it, I need to go down, but currently from (6,3), I can't go down because it's occupied.\n> \n> After moving, I might be able to go down later.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is at bottom left.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk with the tail: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,3), and head at (6,3), not adjacent.

But tail moves to where body 5 was, (4,1).\n> \n> New positions: head (4,3), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)  // (4,1) is the new tail.\n> \n> Old tail was (4,2), which moved to (4,1), and (4,2) is now empty.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) is still there, etc.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 22, I must choose U or L.\n> \n> If I go U, I eat food at (5,4), grow to length 8, head at (5,4).\n> \n> If I go L, I move to (4,3), no food, snake shifts, tail at (4,1) now.\n> \n> I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger with tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because collision.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is not on the tail yet.\n> \n> Let's look at food positions.\n> \n> (3,1): near the body, currently (4,1) and (4,2) are snake, so (3,1) is adjacent to (4,1), which is body, not tail yet.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1): (6,1) is not occupied, but (6,2) is body, and (5,1) is body, so (6,1) might be accessible.\n> \n> (5,4) is above head.\n> \n> I should consider the life spans.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) life span 5, so from turn 22, after this turn, if not eaten, life span dec to 4, then 3,2,1,0 at turn 27? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 22, life span 5. After turn 22 is completed, life span decreases to 4. After turn 23, to 3, turn 24 to 2, turn 25 to 1, turn 26 to 0, so it disappears after turn 26, meaning it can be eaten up to turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 7: after turn 22, 6; turn 23,5; ... down to 0 at turn 28.\n> \n> (5,4) life span 10: after turn 22,9; to 0 at turn 31.\n> \n> So (3,1) is the most urgent, but only if I can get to it.\n> \n> Now, let's think about paths.\n> \n> First, if I go U at turn 22: to (5,4), eat food.

Positions: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1) tail.\n> \n> So (4,2) is not occupied? Positions: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So (4,2) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is food, (6,1) is food.\n> \n> Now, about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,1). Head is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (4,1); adjacent would be same x or y, differ by 1. (4,3) and (4,1) differ by 2 in y, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells to tail (4,1) are: (4,0) wall, (4,2) empty, (3,1) food, (5,1) body.\n> \n> So head is not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger.\n> \n> But if head moves to (4,2), that is adjacent to tail (4,1), and (4,2) has no food, so even if head goes to (4,2), it's not eating food there, so no issue.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\" only if the tail cell has food and head moves to it when adjacent? Let's read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> The key is \"eating it\", meaning when the head moves onto the food cell that is also the tail position.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,1), which has no food; food is at (3,1), not on tail.\n> \n> So no problem now.\n> \n> But if head were to eat (3,1), which is adjacent to tail, since (3,1) and (4,1) are adjacent, so if head moves to (3,1) while tail is at (4,1), then after eating, snake grows, so new tail is where? When you eat food, length increases, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard Snake mechanics: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place, meaning the snake grows.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, length increases by one, and the tail does not move that turn. So the new segment is added at the position where the head was before moving? No.\n> \n> Sequence: on a turn, you choose direction, head moves to new cell. If new cell has food, you eat it, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move; i.e., the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the head position after move.\n> \n> But the head moves to the new cell, so the new segment is at the new head position? No.\n> \n> Let's think: before move, snake has positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move, if no eat, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the one before, tail moves away from its position, so that cell is free.\n> \n> If eat, head moves to food cell, eats, so new head position is food cell, and since length increases, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but tail doesn't move? Standard: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the segment that was tail is still there, and a new tail segment is added? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when you eat, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Typically, in Snake, when you move and eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but since you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new length is old length +1, with the head at new position, and the tail still at old tail position, and all segments in between shift.\n> \n> For example, suppose snake: [H, B, T] at positions P_H, P_B, P_T.\n> \n> Move head to new cell P_new, which has food. Then after move, snake becomes [P_new, P_H, P_B, P_T] so length +1, tail is P_T.\n> \n> P_T is still occupied, and no segment moved from P_T.\n> \n> Then next move, if no eat, head moves to another cell, say P_new2, then body: P_new becomes B, P_H becomes next, P_B becomes tail, and P_T is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the tail position remains occupied.\n> \n> Now, for \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> \"the tail cell has positive food\" — meaning the cell where the tail is located has food on it.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to that cell to eat it, but since the tail is there, moving to tail cell would cause collision with body, unless it's the tail and you can move to tail because tail moves away.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Let's parse: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, scenario: tail cell has food. Head is adjacent to tail. If head moves to the tail cell to eat the food.\n> \n> After eating: head moves to tail cell (which had food), eats it, so snake grows. New snake: the old positions, but head now at the tail cell, and since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so the old tail position is still occupied by the tail segment? No.\n> \n> Before move: head at H, tail at T, and T has food.\n> \n> Head is adjacent to T, so head can move to T.\n> \n> When head moves to T: since T has food, it eats it. So new head position is T. And since it ate, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, meaning the segment that was tail remains at T, but now head is also at T? That can't be; collision.\n> \n> The new segments: the head moves to T, so the first body segment is the old head position, and so on, up to the tail, which stays at old tail position? But if head moves to T, which is old tail, and tail stays, then both at same position, collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the danger. So if head moves directly to the tail cell when it has food, after move, head and tail are at same position, causing collision.\n> \n> If no food, moving to tail cell is ok because tail moves away, so head occupies it and tail leaves.\n> \n> But with food, tail doesn't move, so collision.\n> \n> Hence the danger.\n> \n> In this state, tail is at (4,1), which has no food; food is at (3,1), which is adjacent but not the tail cell. So (3,1) has food, but it's not the tail cell, so eating (3,1) is fine, no danger.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> Now back to current move.\n> \n> I need to choose action for turn 23.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food.\n> \n> (5,4) is at (5,4), life span 9, so not urgent.\n> \n> (3,1) at (3,1), life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 26, so I have until turn 26 to eat it. Current turn 23, so turns 23,24,25,26 it exists, can be eaten on any of these turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 6, so until turn 28.\n> \n> But (6,1) is near the tail area.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is mostly on the bottom and right.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, bottom to top? Usually in coordinates, y=1 might be bottom or top? But in the positions, snake has (4,1), (5,1), so y=1 is bottom, I think, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is low, y=6 high.\n> \n> Similarly, x from 1 left to 6 right.\n> \n> So let's set up:\n> \n> y=6 top\n> y=5\n> y=4\n> y=3\n> y=2\n> y=1 bottom\n> \n> x=1 left to x=6 right.\n> \n> Walls: borders and (3,6) blocked.\n> \n> (3,6) is x=3,y=6.\n> \n> Snake: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n> \n> So positions:\n> - (4,3) head\n> - (5,3)\n> - (6,3)\n> - (6,2)\n> - (5,2)\n> - (5,1)\n> - (4,1) tail\n> \n> Food:\n> - (3,1) value 1, life 4\n> - (6,1) value 1, life 6\n> - (5,4) value 1, life 9\n> \n> Empty cells: for example, (4,2) is empty, (3,3) empty, (4,4) empty, etc.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,3), moves:\n> - U to (4,4): empty\n> - D to (4,2): empty\n> - L to (3,3): empty\n> \n> R to (5,3) occupied, invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the life span of (3,1). It has life span 4, so if I want to eat it, I should do so within the next 3 moves (turns 24,25,26) since on turn 27 it disappears. Turn 23 current, so I can eat on turn 23,24,25,26.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) can be eaten later.\n> \n> (5,4) is easy to get.\n> \n> But I need to avoid trapping myself.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Current length 7, grid 6x6 minus obstacles, but (3,6) blocked, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells, snake 7, so 28 free cells, but with food, etc.\n> \n> But with growth, it will get tighter.\n> \n> Now, let's consider paths to food.\n> \n> First, to eat (3,1): from head (4,3), I can go L to (3,3), then from (3,3) I can go D to (3,2), then L to (3,1)? (3,2) to (3,1) is down? y=2 to y=1 is down? y=1 is bottom, so from (3,2) to (3,1) is down.\n> \n> But (3,1) has food, so if I go to (3,1), I eat it.\n> \n> From (3,3), I could go L to (2,3) but x=2 is within 1-6, but (2,3) might be empty, but not directly to food.\n> \n> Shortest path to (3,1): from (4,3) to (3,1) is not adjacent, so at least two moves.\n> \n> Possible: via (3,3) and (3,2), or via (4,2) and (3,2), etc.\n> \n> Similarly, to (6,1): from (4,3), not direct.\n> \n> To (5,4): (5,4) is at (5,4), head at (4,3), so I can go U to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (5,4) is right, but (5,4) has food, so if I go to (5,4) from (4,4), I eat it.\n> \n> But (5,4) is adjacent to (4,4) and to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, occupied.\n> \n> So only from (4,4) or (5,5) or (6,4), etc., but (4,4) is accessible.\n> \n> Now, also, the tail is at (4,1), and as the snake moves, the tail will move, freeing up cells.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (4,2), then tail might move later.\n> \n> I need to simulate a few moves.\n> \n> But I have to choose a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> The action sequence should be for turns 23,24,25,... up to at least turn 28 or so.\n> \n> But I need to decide the first move.\n> \n> Let's consider risks.\n> \n> If I go L to (3,3) on turn 23, then from there, I can go D to (3,2) on turn 24, then to (3,1) on turn 25 to eat, but life span allows, or I can eat on turn 24 if I go directly, but from (3,3) to (3,1) is not adjacent, so I need to go to (3,2) first.\n> \n> From (4,3), if I go D to (4,2) on turn 23, then from (4,2) I can go L to (3,2) on turn 24, then to (3,1) on turn 25 to eat.\n> \n> Or from (4,2) I can go D to (4,1) but (4,1) is tail, and it has no food, so moving to (4,1) is ok because tail will move away.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go U to (4,4), then I can go to (5,4) to eat.\n> \n> But (5,4) has long life, so not urgent.\n> \n> (3,1) has short life, so I should prioritize eating it before it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) has longer life.\n> \n> Also, (6,1) is near the body; let's see if it's reachable.\n> \n> (6,1) has food, but is it under the snake?

Let's see the positions.\n> \n> After move turn 23: head to (3,3), so new positions: head (3,3), then body: the old head (4,3) becomes first body, so [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1) ] and tail was (4,1), but since no eat, tail moves, so the last segment (4,1) is removed? No.\n> \n> When no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So before move: positions [H: (4,3), B1: (5,3), B2: (6,3), B3: (6,2), B4: (5,2), B5: (5,1), T: (4,1)]\n> \n> After moving left to (3,3), no eat, so new head: (3,3), then B1 moves to old H position (4,3), B2 moves to old B1 (5,3), B3 moves to old B2 (6,3), B4 moves to old B3 (6,2), B5 moves to old B4 (5,2), T moves to old B5 (5,1), and old T (4,1) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1) ] and (4,1) is free now.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,1).\n> \n> Now, food at (6,1) is still there.\n> \n> Now turn 24, from (3,3), I can go D to (3,2), for example.\n> \n> Then to (3,1) on turn 25.\n> \n> But let's plan sequence.\n> \n> Since I want to eat (3,1), I should head towards it.\n> \n> But from (3,3), going to (3,2) and then (3,1) is direct.\n> \n> But I need to consider if (3,1) is safe to eat.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (3,1).

It's turn 24, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,3), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including this one. So at turn 24, life span 3, it will be gone by turn 27? Let's clarify life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (3,1), life span 3 at turn 24: after turn 24, life span becomes 2; after turn 25, it becomes 1; after turn 26, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 24, 25, or 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) with value 1, life span 5: available until turn 28 (since 24+5-1=28? Let's think: at turn 24, life span 5; turn 25, span 4; ... turn 28, span 1; turn 29, span 0, gone. So eatable on turns 24 to 28 inclusive.\n> \n> Life span N at turn t means it has N turns left, including current, so it disappears after t + N - 1 turns? Example: if N=1 at turn t, it can be eaten only on turn t, then gone. If N=2, can be eaten on t or t+1, gone at t+2. So for (3,1): life span 3 at turn 24, so available turns: 24, 25, 26. Gone at turn 27.\n> \n> (6,1): life span 5, available turns 24 to 28.\n> \n> (5,4): life span 8, available turns 24 to 31.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,3), moving left. So from (3,3), possible moves: since head direction is L, it can go U, D, L, but not R (because reverse is not allowed instantly). Head direction is L, so it came from the right, so cannot go right immediately? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is the last move, which is L, so opposite is R. So cannot go right on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3): Up to (3,4), Down to (3,2), Left to (2,3). Cannot go Right to (4,3) because that's opposite to current left direction.\n> \n> But (4,3) is occupied by the snake body, so it would be a collision anyway, but even if not, cannot go right because of the no reverse rule.\n> \n> Now, grid borders: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so (3,4) is within bounds, (3,2) is within, (2,3) is within.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), but that's not near head now.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (3,3): head\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (6,2)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,1): tail\n> \n> Now, food at (3,1), (6,1), (5,4).\n> \n> (3,1) is below, (6,1) is left-down, (5,4) is up-right.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's find where the snake can move safely this turn.\n> \n> From head (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (3,4). Is this safe? (3,4) is not a wall, not an obstacle, and not in snake body? Snake body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1). (3,4) not in list, so empty? But food is at (5,4), not (3,4). So (3,4) should be empty and safe to move to, unless I'm missing something.\n> \n> - Down: to (3,2). (3,2) not in body, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,3). (2,3) not in body, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> - Right: to (4,3), but (4,3) is body segment, so collision. Also, cannot go right because of no reverse, but it's invalid anyway.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, if I go Up to (3,4), then head at (3,4), body follows: new head (3,4), then (3,3) becomes body, (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), and tail (5,1) moves to where? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away from current position.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving up: positions become: head (3,4), then segment 1: (3,3), segment 2: (4,3), segment 3: (5,3), segment 4: (6,3), segment 5: (6,2), segment 6: (5,2), and tail segment 7: (5,1) is left, but when head moves, the last segment is removed if no food eaten, but since no food, length same, so tail at (5,2) is removed? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake positions: before move: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1) ]\n> \n> After moving head to new position without eating, the tail end is removed. So new positions: head at new pos, then the first body segment at old head pos, then next at old first body pos, and so on, up to the second last body segment, and the last one (tail) is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So for example, if move up to (3,4):\n> \n> - New head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Then, the segment that was at (3,3) is now the first body segment at (3,3)?

Tail has no food on it, I think. Food positions are separate; they can be under body but not eaten until head moves there after body moves away.\n> \n> Currently, no food under snake, I think. Food at (3,1), (6,1), (5,4). (5,4) is not occupied, snake is at (5,3), (6,3), etc., not (5,4). (3,1) not occupied, (6,1) not occupied; snake has (6,2) and (5,1), not (6,1).

It's turn 26, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), and tail at (5,2). So the snake has 8 segments. The head direction is down, which is D. That means it was moving downward to reach (3,1) from (3,2)? Positions are listed from head to tail, so at turn 26, head is at (3,1), and it was at (3,2) before, so if it moved down to (3,1), that would be decreasing y, since y=0 is probably the bottom? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, y=0 might be the bottom or top. But the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so increasing y is up, decreasing y is down. So (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? U is (x,y+1), so if y increases, it's going up. But in the positions, head is at (3,1), and previous position is (3,2). Since it was at (3,2) and now at (3,1), and direction is D (down), that makes sense because y decreased from 2 to 1.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 26, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 28? Let's see: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's gone on turn t + N. Since it decreases each turn including current, after one turn (turn 27), life span becomes 2, then turn 28 it becomes 1, and on turn 29 it should be gone? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, life span is L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, L decreases to L-1? Or at turn t, it's still L, and decreases at end of turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So I think at the start of turn, the life span is as given, and after the turn, it decreases. But for movement, we consider the state at the beginning of the turn.\n> \n> The food is given with life span at current turn t1=26.\n> \n> For (6,1): value 1, life span 3. So at turn 26, life span=3. After turn 26, it decreases to 2. After turn 27, to 1. After turn 28, to 0, and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 26, 27, or 28, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): value 1, life span 6. So at turn 26, life span=6, disappears after turn 31? After turn 26: 5, turn 27:4, ..., after turn 31:0, gone. So available until turn 31.\n> \n> And (1,3): value 1, life span 9. Available for many turns.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,1), direction down. So from (3,2) to (3,1), moving down.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse, so since current direction is D, I cannot go U immediately, because U is opposite to D. Opposites: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n> \n> So from current direction D, I cannot go U next. Possible moves: D, L, or R. But I have to consider the grid.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

But (5,1) is free?

Tail is at (5,2), which is adjacent to (6,1)? (5,2) and (6,1): dx=1, dy=1, so not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, distance 1.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: for (6,1), neighbors are (6,2), (6,0), (5,1), (7,1). (7,1) is wall since x=7, (6,0) wall y=0.\n> \n> (6,2) is occupied by snake body, but (6,2) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> When I move to (6,1), if (6,2) is there, it might be a problem.\n> \n> Rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\" but here, the food is at (6,1), not on tail.\n> \n> The tail danger is specific: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, eating that food causes collision because after eating, tail doesn't move away, so head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, for (6,1), it's not on tail.\n> \n> Now, moving to (6,1): if I go there, and eat, snake grows, so new tail is added, but the existing tail moves? When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when you eat positive food, length increases by one, so after move, the new head is at food, and the tail remains, so the snake extends.\n> \n> Then next turn, when moving, the tail moves if no food eaten.\n> \n> But collision is checked at the moment of move.\n> \n> When moving head to a cell with food, you eat it, so the head moves to that cell, and since food is eaten, the snake grows, meaning that the tail does not move in this turn; it stays, so the new segment is added at the position where food was, but since head is moving there, it's fine, and tail remains.\n> \n> Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> For collision: when you move head to a new cell, if that cell is wall or body (except current tail), collision.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,1), what is currently at (6,1)? It's food, so not occupied by snake body. Snake body has (6,2) and (6,3), etc., but (6,1) is free except food.\n> \n> (6,2) is occupied by snake body, and it's not the tail; tail is (5,2).\n> \n> If I move to (6,1), which is adjacent to (6,2), but (6,2) is a body segment, so when head moves to (6,1), it will be adjacent to body at (6,2), but since it's not the same cell, it's not collision yet. Collision is when head touches body, meaning same cell.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" means head occupies the same cell as a body segment.\n> \n> When head moves to (6,1), the cell (6,1) is now head, and (6,2) is a different cell, so no collision. Then, after eating, the snake grows, so the body includes the previous positions, and tail stays at (5,2) for now.\n> \n> Then next turn, I can move from there.\n> \n> But (6,1) is surrounded: up is (6,2) which is body, down is (6,0) wall, left is (5,1), right is (7,1) wall.\n> \n> So from (6,1), possible moves: only to (5,1), since (6,2) is body and not tail, (6,0) wall, (7,1) wall.\n> \n> (5,1) is currently free? Snake has (5,2) and (5,3), so (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> But after moving to (6,1) and eating, the snake positions: head at (6,1), then body: since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (6,1), then previous head was (3,1), but the body: let's think.\n> \n> Current positions before move: [(3,1)H, (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)T]\n> \n> After moving to (6,1): head moves to (6,1), and since we eat food (positive), length increases, so the tail does not move. So new positions: head at (6,1), then the previous body: (3,1) becomes new segment? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> But when no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> When food eaten, tail is not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> So in this case: from current state, move head to (6,1).\n> \n> Then the new head is at (6,1).\n> \n> The body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,1)? Let's index.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (3,1), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: tail (5,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,1) and eating, so new head at (6,1), then segment 1 moves to (3,1), but (3,1) was head, now it's occupied by segment 1? In terms of positions: the new position list is: head at (6,1), then the previous positions: but since we add a segment, the body is [ (3,1) , (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2) ] and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so all segments are kept, and a new segment is added at the end? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Typically: when snake moves without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, tail is removed from its cell.\n> \n> With eating: head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, but tail is not removed, so the snake has one more segment; the position where tail was is still occupied.\n> \n> In this case, before move, positions: P0 = (3,1), P1 = (3,2), P2 = (3,3), P3 = (4,3), P4 = (5,3), P5 = (6,3), P6 = (6,2), P7 = (5,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,1): new head is (6,1)\n> \n> Then P1 moves to P0's position (3,1)\n> \n> P2 moves to P1's position (3,2) -- but P1 was (3,2), now moving to where P0 was.\n> \n> Better to think: the new position of segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i from 1 to len-1, and for the new head, it's the new cell.\n> \n> After eating, the tail segment remains, so the last segment stays.\n> \n> So new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head position (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 position (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old segment 2 position (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old segment 3 position (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old segment 4 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: old segment 5 position (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: old segment 6 position (6,2)\n> \n> - New tail: old segment 7 position (5,2)  // since we ate, tail doesn't move, so segment 7 is now the new segment 8? Length increases.\n> \n> Old snake has 8 segments: indices 0 to 7.\n> \n> After eating: new head at (6,1)\n> \n> Then for body segments, new segment 1 = old pos of segment 0 = (3,1)\n> \n> New segment 2 = old pos of segment 1 = (3,2)\n> \n> New segment 3 = old pos of segment 2 = (3,3)\n> \n> New segment 4 = old pos of segment 3 = (4,3)\n> \n> New segment 5 = old pos of segment 4 = (5,3)\n> \n> New segment 6 = old pos of segment 5 = (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 7 = old pos of segment 6 = (6,2)\n> \n> And new segment 8 = old pos of segment 7 = (5,2)  // tail\n> \n> So new positions: [(6,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]\n> \n> Now, the body includes (6,2) and (3,1), etc.\n> \n> From (6,1), head position, what moves are possible?\n> \n> Direction: since we moved to (6,1) from previous head (3,1), but the move was to (6,1), which is right and down?

It depends on the movement.\n> \n> Better to think after movement: new head position, then body follows.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,1), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After head moves there, that cell is now head, and the body segment that was there will move to the next position. But since it's moving, the cell (3,1) is being left by the body, but head is moving into it simultaneously.\n> \n> According to collision rules: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides. But the tail is special.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, in this case, (3,1) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,2). (3,1) is the second segment. So if head moves to (3,1), it would collide with the body segment that is still there? No.\n> \n> At the moment of movement, when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body part except the current tail, it's a collision because that body part hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> But after movement, the positions are updated.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: all parts move simultaneously. So when head moves to a new cell, the body segments shift, so the cell that was behind head is now occupied by the next segment, and so on, until the tail moves to the position of the previous tail-1.\n> \n> For a cell that was occupied by a body segment, if head moves there, it might be ok only if it's the tail cell and tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,1) is currently occupied by the segment that was just behind head. When head moves left to (3,1), at the same time, that segment will move to where the head was? Let's sequence it.\n> \n> Before move: positions: head (4,1), seg1 (3,1), seg2 (3,2), ..., tail (6,2)\n> \n> If head moves left to (3,1), then after move:\n> \n> - New head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Then the body: seg1 moves to where head was? No, the body segments move to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> Specifically: the segment that was at seg1 position (3,1) will move to the position that seg1 was connected to, but since head moved, it's messy.\n> \n> Standard: the new position of each body segment is the old position of the segment closer to head.\n> \n> So for seg1 (index 1), its new position is the old position of head, which is (4,1).\n> \n> Similarly, seg2 new position is old position of seg1, which is (3,1), but (3,1) is where head is moving to? Conflict.\n> \n> I think I have it: when moving, the head moves to the new cell first. Then each body segment moves to the old position of the segment immediately before it in the list.\n> \n> So for example:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position, say (3,1)\n> \n> - Then seg1 (which was at (3,1)) moves to the old position of head, which is (4,1)\n> \n> - Seg2 (which was at (3,2)) moves to the old position of seg1, which was (3,1)\n> \n> But (3,1) is now occupied by the new head, so seg2 moving to (3,1) would cause it to be at the same position as head, collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the issue.\n> \n> So generally, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it will result in collision because that body segment is moving to a new position, but during the move, head is on the same cell as it.\n> \n> For the tail, if head moves to the tail cell, the tail moves away to the previous position, so it might be ok.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> So moving left to (3,1) is invalid because it would cause head to collide with seg1.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (4,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving right to (5,1): (5,1) is not occupied, I think. Occupied cells: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2). So (5,1) is free? Let's see, x=5,y=1: not in list, so yes.\n> \n> (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> Moving up to (4,2): (4,2) not in occupied, so free.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), R to (5,1), D invalid, L invalid because to (3,1) occupied and not tail.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) because that would be opposite. Current head direction is R, meaning it was moving right, so from (4,1), it came from left, so moving left would be reverse, which is not allowed on next turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) on this turn. So L is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,1), valid moves: U (up to (4,2)) or R (right to (5,1)).\n> \n> D is wall, L is reverse and also occupied, so only U or R.\n> \n> Now, food: (6,1) with life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28.\n> \n> (5,4) with life span 5, (1,3) with life span 8.\n> \n> I need to think about eating food, but with risks.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (6,2). What food is there? Food at (6,1), (5,4), (1,3). (6,1) is above tail? Tail at (6,2), so (6,1) is adjacent, directly above.\n> \n> Head is at (4,1), not adjacent to tail. Tail is at (6,2), head at (4,1), distance: dx=2, dy=1, not adjacent. Adjacent would be sharing side, like (5,2), (6,1), (6,3), (7,2) but x=7 wall.\n> \n> So head not adjacent to tail now.\n> \n> But if I move to eat (6,1), that might bring head adjacent to tail or something.\n> \n> First, let's consider immediate options.\n> \n> Turn 27, I can move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> If I move R to (5,1), that's towards the food at (6,1)? (5,1) to (6,1) is right, but (6,1) has food with short life.\n> \n> But from (5,1), I could go right to (6,1) next turn, if possible.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2), then I'm going up.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food at (6,1). Life span 2, so if not eaten by turn 28, it disappears. Turn 27: life=2, after turn 27 it becomes 1, after turn 28 it becomes 0, gone. So it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28.\n> \n> To eat it, I need to move head to (6,1) when it's there.\n> \n> Currently at (4,1), so to reach (6,1), I need to move right twice: to (5,1) then to (6,1), or other paths but that's direct.\n> \n> But (5,1) is free, as we said.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), the tail is at (6,2), which will move when I move.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Turn 27: if I move R to (5,1), then new positions: head (5,1), body: seg1 moves to old head (4,1), seg2 to old seg1 (3,1), seg3 to old seg2 (3,2), and so on, up to seg7 (tail) moves to old seg6 position. Old positions: head (4,1), seg1 (3,1), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (3,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (6,3), seg7/tail (6,2)\n> \n> After move right to (5,1):\n> \n> - New head: (5,1)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head position (4,1)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 position (3,1)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 position (3,2)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 position (3,3)\n> \n> - New seg5: old seg4 position (4,3)\n> \n> - New seg6: old seg5 position (5,3)\n> \n> - New seg7/tail: old seg6 position (6,3)\n> \n> So tail now at (6,3).\n> \n> Food at (6,1) is still there.\n> \n> Now, from (5,1), I can move to (6,1) on turn 28, if I choose to.\n> \n> Move R to (6,1): (6,1) is not occupied now? After above, positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Also, (6,1) is not wall, x=6,y=1, borders x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not border, y=1 not border, so ok.\n> \n> Move R to (6,1): then I eat the food, since it's positive, snake grows.\n> \n> After eating, head moves to (6,1), and since food is eaten, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move, or rather, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> When food is eaten, after moving to the food cell, the snake doesn't remove the tail, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 28, if head moves to (6,1) which has food, then after move: head at (6,1), body segments: the previous positions, and since food eaten, tail stays, so new segment added at the end.\n> \n> Before move to (6,1), positions at turn 27 end: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> Move head to (6,1), so new head (6,1)\n> \n> Then body: seg1 to old head (5,1), seg2 to old seg1 (4,1), seg3 to old seg2 (3,1), seg4 to old seg3 (3,2), seg5 to old seg4 (3,3), seg6 to old seg5 (4,3), seg7 to old seg6 (5,3), and since food eaten, add new segment at old tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> After movement to food cell: head is on food, so the body moves as usual, but the last segment (tail) is not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions after eating: new head at (6,1), then seg1 at (5,1), seg2 at (4,1), seg3 at (3,1), seg4 at (3,2), seg5 at (3,3), seg6 at (4,3), seg7 at (5,3), and new seg8 at old tail position (6,3).

It's turn 28, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,1), and the body segments are: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 1. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after this turn, it might disappear? Life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since it's turn 28, and life span 1, if not eaten now, it will be gone next turn.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,1) with life span 1, on turn 28, if not eaten, it disappears after this turn, meaning it won't be there on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) with value 1, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 28 + 4 - 1?

But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For food at (6,1): life span 1, so on turn 28, countdown is 1. If not eaten this turn, after this turn, countdown becomes 0 and it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 28 or not at all.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,4): life span 4, countdown starts at 4 on turn 28? The state is given at turn 28, so for each food, the life span is the remaining life at this turn.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" are given for current turn t1=28. So for (6,1), life_span=1 means it has only this turn to be eaten; after turn 28, it will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) has life_span=4, so it will last until turn 28 + 3? Let's see:\n> \n> - Turn 28: life_span=1 for (6,1) → if not eaten, gone after turn.\n> \n> - Turn 28: life_span=4 for (5,4) → it will decrease to 3 on turn 29, 2 on 30, 1 on 31, gone after 31.\n> \n> General: at turn t, with life_span L, it will be present from t to t+L-1, and disappear after turn t+L-1. Since countdown decreases every turn, starting from L at turn t.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1. After turn t+L-1, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,1): L=1, so only on turn 28.\n> \n> For (5,4): L=4, so can be eaten on turns 28,29,30,31.\n> \n> (1,3): L=7, can be eaten on turns 28 to 34.\n> \n> (4,6): L=10, can be eaten on turns 28 to 37.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,1), moving right (R). From the positions, the snake is at:\n> \n> - Head: (5,1)\n> \n> - Then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> So the tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> Since head is moving right, from (5,1) to (6,1) is possible, but (6,1) has food with value 1, but life span 1, so only this turn.\n> \n> But let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, except internal obstacles are given separately? No, it says:\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. - Internal Obstacles: [(3,6)]\"\n> \n> So border cells are walls, and (3,6) is an internal obstacle, also a wall.\n> \n> So grid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7. Walls at all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,6).\n> \n> Snake body: from head to tail: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> So the snake forms a sort of \"U\" shape or something. From (3,1) down to (3,3), then right to (6,3).\n> \n> Head at (5,1), which is above the body segment at (5,3), but not adjacent since y=1 vs y=3.\n> \n> Possible moves from head at (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since moving R, I cannot move L (left) next turn, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Opposite of R is L, so I cannot move L this turn. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Now, check what cells are around (5,1):\n> \n> - Right (R): (6,1) - is this a wall? x=6, y=1. x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, and not (3,6), so it's free. But (6,1) has food with life span 1.\n> \n> - Up (U): (5,2) - y=2, not border, not obstacle, so free. Is there snake body? Snake positions: (5,1) head, (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (5,2) is not in the list, so empty.\n> \n> - Down (D): (5,0) - y=0, which is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left (L): (4,1) - but that's the body segment immediately behind the head. But rule: I can move into a cell if it's the tail and the tail moves, but here (4,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,3). (4,1) is the second segment, so if I move left to (4,1), head would collide with body, which is deadly.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to tail, tail moves away, so it's safe only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (4,1) is a body segment, not the tail, so moving left to (4,1) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,0) is wall, cannot move.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,1) with direction R:\n> \n> - R to (6,1): free, and has food.\n> \n> - U to (5,2): free, no body.\n> \n> - D to (5,0): wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L to (4,1): body, collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only U or R are possible this turn.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, immediate choice: move R to (6,1) and eat the food, or move U to (5,2).\n> \n> If I move R to (6,1), I eat the food at (6,1) with value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,3). Head at (5,1), tail at (6,3), are they adjacent? (5,1) and (6,3) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so same row or column, diff by 1 in x or y.\n> \n> (5,1) to (6,3): delta x=1, delta y=2, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, not directly adjacent. Adjacent cells are (x±1,y) or (x,y±1), so Manhattan distance 1.\n> \n> Here, (5,1) to (6,3) has |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |2| = 3 >1, so not adjacent. So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (6,1) should be safe and I get +1 score, length increases.\n> \n> After eating, new head at (6,1), and since I ate, length increases, so new tail? When I eat, the tail doesn't move this turn; the head moves to food, and since it's food, snake grows, so tail stays, new segment added.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of movement: when the head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves, all segments move, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> - If food, head moves to food, eats it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new head position, and the segment that was tail is still there, but now it's part of body.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,1) and eat, head is now (6,1), and the body includes (5,1), (4,1), etc., and tail is still (6,3) for now, but after growth, the tail will be the same until next move.\n> \n> After move to food: positions become: head (6,1), then previous head (5,1) becomes second segment, so positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] and since I ate, length increases, so tail remains (6,3), but (6,3) is now the 9th segment? List:\n> \n> New positions after eating at (6,1): snake had 8 segments, after eating, 9 segments. So:\n> \n> - New head: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (tail): (6,3)\n> \n> Tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> Now, direction: since I moved R to (6,1), new head direction is R.\n> \n> From (6,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move L (opposite of R).\n> \n> Now, (6,1) is at x=6, y=1.\n> \n> - R: (7,1) - x=7 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - U: (6,2) - is this free? y=2, x=6, not border, not obstacle. Snake body: positions include (6,3), (5,3), etc., but (6,2) is not in the list, so free.\n> \n> - D: (6,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (5,1) - but that's the second segment now, body, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> So only possible move from (6,1) is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Then head at (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move D (opposite of U).\n> \n> (6,2) to:\n> \n> - U: (6,3) - but (6,3) is the tail! So I can move to tail if it's safe.\n> \n> Currently, tail at (6,3). If I move to (6,3), since it's the tail, and I move there, what happens?\n> \n> Rule: moving to tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, when I move head to (6,3), the tail is at (6,3), but since head moves to it, and it's not food? (6,3) has no food? We don't know, but in this position, (6,3) is tail, no food mentioned, so if I move to (6,3), head and tail share the cell? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell occupied by tail, since tail will move, it's safe. But only if no food there.\n> \n> In this case, (6,3) has no food, so moving to (6,3) should be safe.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (6,3), tail moves away to the next segment.\n> \n> Current positions before move: head at (6,2), body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), tail at (6,3).\n> \n> If I move U to (6,3), which is tail.\n> \n> Since head moves to (6,3), and tail was there, but tail moves to (5,3) or something? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If the cell is empty, head moves, all segments follow, tail leaves.\n> \n> - If food, head eats, grows, tail stays.\n> \n> - If tail, head moves to tail cell, and since tail moves, it's okay; the tail moves to the previous position of segment before it.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to tail cell, the head and tail were adjacent, head moves to tail, tail moves to the next cell in line.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,2) to (6,3), head at (6,3), and the segment that was at (6,3) moves to where? The body follows: the segment that was at (6,1) moves to (6,2)? Let's list positions.\n> \n> Before move: positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), tail (6,3) — but tail is (6,3), and (5,3) is before it.\n> \n> The positions are ordered: index 0: head (6,2), index 1: (6,1), index 2: (5,1), index 3: (4,1), index 4: (3,1), index 5: (3,2), index 6: (3,3), index 7: (4,3), index 8: (5,3), index 9: tail (6,3). After eating, we have 9 segments.\n> \n> When head moves to (6,3), which is the current tail position.\n> \n> New head: (6,3)\n> \n> Then the segments: the body follows: segment 1 moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the first body segment moves to the previous head position, and so on, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> In this case, head moves from (6,2) to (6,3).\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (which was at (6,1)) moves to the previous head position (6,2)? No.\n> \n> The body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)  // moved to this cell\n> \n> - Segment 1 (index 1) moves to where head was, (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (index 2) moves to where segment 1 was, (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (index 3) moves to where segment 2 was, (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (index 4) moves to where segment 3 was, (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (index 5) moves to where segment 4 was, (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (index 6) moves to where segment 5 was, (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (index 7) moves to where segment 6 was, (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (index 8) moves to where segment 7 was, (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (tail, index 9) moves to where segment 8 was, (5,3)\n> \n> So new tail at (5,3).\n> \n> And the cell (6,3) is now head, no longer tail.\n> \n> But since we moved to (6,3) which was tail, and tail moved away, no collision.\n> \n> Also, (6,3) had no food, so no eating.\n> \n> So after this, positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), tail (5,3)\n> \n> Direction: since moved U, now head direction U.\n> \n> But back to the immediate choice.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,1) this turn, I eat the food, grow to 9, then I must move U to (6,2), then from there I can move U to (6,3) or other directions.\n> \n> From (6,2), after moving U from (6,1), head at (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Then moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,3): as above, safe, no food.\n> \n> - L to (5,2): free?

Previous position should be before head in the list. Snake positions are given in order: head first, so from (6,1) to (6,3) tail. Since head direction is R, it was moving right to reach (6,1). But (5,1) is left of (6,1), so if head was at (5,1) before and moved right to (6,1), that makes sense. Direction is the current movement direction.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned, so all are +1 reward.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so on turn 29, food at (5,4) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn, so if life span is N on turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So on turn t, if food has life span L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and it disappears when life span reaches 0.

Tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> So if head moves to (6,2), then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then body: (6,1) becomes the first segment (since head was there)\n> \n> - Then (5,1) becomes next\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (5,3) — and tail was (6,3), but since head moved, the tail moves to where the second last segment was? Let's think.\n> \n> The positions list: after move, head is at new position (6,2), then the previous head position (6,1) is now the first body segment, and so on, up to the previous second last segment becomes the new tail.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (6,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2), the new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Body: positions 0 to 7 become the new body segments: so segment 1: (6,1) (previous head), segment 2: (5,1), segment 3: (4,1), segment 4: (3,1), segment 5: (3,2), segment 6: (3,3), segment 7: (4,3), segment 8: (5,3) — and the tail, which was position 8 (6,3), is no longer part of snake; the new tail is the last body segment, which is now (5,3), since position 7 was (5,3) but now it's the last.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: previous head position (6,1)\n> \n> - New segment 2: previous segment 1 (5,1)\n> \n> - New segment 3: previous segment 2 (4,1)\n> \n> - New segment 4: previous segment 3 (3,1)\n> \n> - New segment 5: previous segment 4 (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 6: previous segment 5 (3,3)\n> \n> - New segment 7: previous segment 6 (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 8: previous segment 7 (5,3) — and since there were 9 segments, after move, the snake has the same length, no food eaten, so length unchanged, tail is now at (5,3), and (6,3) is empty.\n> \n> Previous tail (6,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, food: we have (5,4), (1,3), (4,6). None at (6,2) or vacated positions.\n> \n> After turn 29, life spans decrease: (5,4) life span was 3, after turn 29 it becomes 2, and so on.\n> \n> But for now, on turn 29, I must move to (6,2), as it's the only choice.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence for multiple turns.

It's turn 31, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given: head at (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to reach (6,3) from (6,2), I assume, since (6,2) is directly below (6,3) if y increases upwards.\n> \n> Let me list the snake positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (3,3)\n> \n> - Tail: (4,3)\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food; no negative food mentioned. Life spans indicate how many turns left, including current turn.\n> \n> Since head direction is Up, and the snake just moved to (6,3), I need to choose the next move: U, D, L, or R. But I have to avoid moving opposite to current direction, which is U, so I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's look at the immediate options for turn 31.\n> \n> From head position (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): but cannot, because reverse is not allowed.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,3), but x=7 is a wall, so cannot move right. Walls are at x=7, so (7,3) is invalid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (6,3) to (7,3) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Also, moving up to (6,4): is that valid? (6,4) is within bounds, but I need to check if it's occupied by body or wall.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). (6,4) is not in this list, so empty.\n> \n> Moving left to (5,3): (5,3) not in snake positions, so empty.\n> \n> (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Now, food: (5,4) is at (5,4), which is above and left of head? Head at (6,3), (5,4) is one left and one up.\n> \n> (5,4) has life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> But eating it might not be safe; I need to consider.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: to (6,4)\n> \n> - L: to (5,3)\n> \n> R is invalid, D is invalid due to reverse.\n> \n> So only U or L.\n> \n> Now, if I go U to (6,4):\n> \n> (6,4) is empty, no food there.\n> \n> Then, from there, I can move next turn.\n> \n> If I go L to (5,3):\n> \n> (5,3) is empty, no food there either.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is adjacent: from (6,3), (5,4) is diagonally up-left, but I can only move orthogonally, so not directly accessible in one move.\n> \n> To reach (5,4), I need to move to (5,3) or (6,4) first, but neither is (5,4).\n> \n> From (6,3), moving L to (5,3) gets me closer to (5,4), since (5,3) is below (5,4).\n> \n> Then from (5,3), I could move up to (5,4) to eat the food, but only if the food is still there and I can move there.\n> \n> But (5,4) has life span 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. Turn 31 is current, so after turn 31, it disappears, meaning if I don't eat it on turn 31, it's gone.\n> \n> On turn 31, I move from current position to a new cell. If I move to a cell with food, I eat it.\n> \n> Currently at turn 31 start, head at (6,3). I choose action for turn 31, which moves the head to a new position.\n> \n> If I move to (5,4), that would eat the food, but from (6,3), I can only move orthogonally: to (6,4) or (5,3) or (7,3) invalid or (6,2) but (6,2) is body and I can't move there.\n> \n> (6,2) is the first body segment, so if I move down to (6,2), that would be collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is not adjacent orthogonally from (6,3); it's diagonal. So I cannot move directly to (5,4) from (6,3) in one move.\n> \n> The only adjacent cells are: up (6,4), down (6,2) but body, left (5,3), right (7,3) wall.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> Neither has food; (5,4) is not reachable this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (5,4) on turn 31 because it's not adjacent to head. So it will disappear after this turn, uneaten.\n> \n> Life span 1, after turn 31 it disappears.\n> \n> So for turn 31, I have two choices: move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> Now, let's think ahead.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (6,4) on turn 31.\n> \n> Then head at (6,4), and tail moves? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, if not eating, tail end is removed. If eating, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,4): no food there, so snake moves, head to (6,4), then body segments follow: (6,3) becomes new position of first segment, (6,2) second, and so on, and tail (4,3) is removed.\n> \n> After move to (6,4), new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Tail was (4,3), but since not eating, tail is removed, so the segment that was at (4,3) is gone, and the new tail is the segment that was previously at (3,3), which is now at position after moving.\n> \n> Let's trace:\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4): new head at (6,4). Then segment 1 moves to where head was, (6,3). Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (6,2). Segment 3 moves to (6,1). Segment 4 moves to (5,1). Segment 5 moves to (4,1). Segment 6 moves to (3,1). Segment 7 moves to (3,2). Segment 8 moves to (3,3). And tail segment 8 was at (4,3), but since not eating, it is removed, so the snake now has segments from head to what was segment 7, but segment 8 moved to (3,3), so new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The last segment is at (3,3), which was previously segment 7, but now it's the tail.\n> \n> List: new snake: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] with head at (6,4), tail at (3,3). Length is still 9? No, since not eating, length decreases? No.\n> \n> When not eating, the snake moves, head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated. So the number of segments remains the same, but the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, original 9 segments. After move: head to (6,4), then body: segment 1 to (6,3) (old head), segment 2 to (6,2) (old seg1), segment 3 to (6,1) (old seg2), segment 4 to (5,1) (old seg3), segment 5 to (4,1) (old seg4), segment 6 to (3,1) (old seg5), segment 7 to (3,2) (old seg6), segment 8 to (3,3) (old seg7). Old seg8 was at (4,3), and since not eating, that cell is vacated, and seg8 is gone. So new snake has 8 segments: positions (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)? Let's count: head and 8 body segments, so 9 cells? I think I confused.\n> \n> Standard: if not eating, snake length remains the same, but it moves forward. So from positions S0, S1, S2, ..., S8.\n> \n> After moving head to new position S0_new, S1 goes to S0, S2 to S1, ..., S8 to S7, and S8 position is empty. So the new positions are: S0_new, S0, S1, S2, ..., S7. So the tail was S8, now S7 is the new tail.\n> \n> In this case: S0: (6,3), S1: (6,2), S2: (6,1), S3: (5,1), S4: (4,1), S5: (3,1), S6: (3,2), S7: (3,3), S8: (4,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4) (U): new head: (6,4)\n> \n> Then S1 moves to (6,3) (old S0)\n> \n> S2 moves to (6,2) (old S1)\n> \n> S3 moves to (6,1) (old S2)\n> \n> S4 moves to (5,1) (old S3)\n> \n> S5 moves to (4,1) (old S4)\n> \n> S6 moves to (3,1) (old S5)\n> \n> S7 moves to (3,2) (old S6)\n> \n> S8 moves to (3,3) (old S7)\n> \n> And old S8 position (4,3) is vacated. New snake positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] with head at (6,4), tail at (3,3). And length is 9, same as before? But S8 moved to (3,3), which was old S7, so now there are 9 segments: new head, and the first 8 old segments in order.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3). So tail at (3,3), and (4,3) is empty now.\n> \n> Length unchanged because not eating.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (5,3) on turn 31.\n> \n> Head to (5,3), then S1 to (6,3), S2 to (6,2), S3 to (6,1), S4 to (5,1), S5 to (4,1), S6 to (3,1), S7 to (3,2), S8 to (3,3), and (4,3) vacated. New positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] head at (5,3), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Back to choices.\n> \n> For turn 31, I can move U or L.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,4), then on turn 32, head at (6,4), direction U (since I moved U).\n> \n> From (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but (6,3) is now body, since after move, (6,3) is occupied by segment 1, so I cannot move down to (6,3), collision.

So on turn 32, (5,4) has no food; it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: for food at (5,4), life span 1, which means it disappears after N turns, including current. So on turn 31, it is present, but if not eaten on turn 31, after turn 31 it disappears.

Rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right. Allowed moves: Left (L), Up (U), Down (D).\n> \n> Coordinates: moving L decreases x, U increases y, D decreases y. Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, but in this case, since y=0 and y=7, and snake has positions like (6,1), (6,2), etc., I think it's standard with y increasing downward or upward? Let's see the positions: from head (5,3) to (6,3) which is right, so (6,3) is east of (5,3). Then body goes to (6,2) which is south if y increases downward, or north if y increases upward.\n> \n> In the list: snake positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), ...] so from (5,3) to (6,3) is increasing x, so right. Then from (6,3) to (6,2) is decreasing y, so down if y=0 is top, or up if y=0 is bottom? Typically in programming, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward. But let's confirm with the walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so likely y=0 is top or bottom? It doesn't specify, but since walls are given as x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, I think it's safe to assume (0,0) is corner, and y increases downward for simplicity, as is common.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), which would be down if y=0 top, or up if y=0 bottom? The movement definition: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And walls y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> In the snake positions, from (6,3) to (6,2), y decreased, and it's the body, so if the head was at (6,3) and moved to (6,2), that would be down if y increases downward.\n> \n> Similarly, from (6,2) to (6,1), y decreased again, down.\n> \n> Then (6,1) to (5,1), x decreased, left.\n> \n> So it seems y increases from top to bottom, with y=0 top, y=7 bottom. U (y+1) is down, D (y-1) is up? That might be confusing.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) — if y+1, and y=0 is top, then y+1 is downward. So U is down? But typically U is up. I think there's a confusion.\n> \n> Let's read the movement constraints: \"U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\"\n> \n> And walls: y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> In the snake positions, when it went from (6,3) to (6,2), that was a move that decreased y, so if it was moving from head, but the positions are listed head first, so the head was at (6,3) at some point, then moved to (6,2) or something? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), ...] so (5,3) is current head. Before that, head was at (6,3), and it moved left to (5,3). Then the body: after head is (6,3), which is the previous head position, then (6,2), which is where the head was before that, and so on.\n> \n> So the movement from (6,3) to (5,3) is left. Before that, from (6,2) to (6,3)? Positions: index 0: (5,3) head, index 1: (6,3), which is the segment just behind head, so when head was at (6,3), it moved to (5,3), leaving (6,3) for body. Before that, head was at (6,2) or something? Let's trace the path.\n> \n> The positions are in order: head at t=32: (5,3)\n> \n> At t=31, head was at (6,3), and it moved left to (5,3), so body at (6,3) is from t=31.\n> \n> At t=30, head was at (6,2) or? Positions: after head (5,3), next is (6,3), then (6,2), so (6,2) is the position at t=30 or earlier.\n> \n> The list is current positions, so at turn 32, segments are: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n> \n> So the tail is (3,3).\n> \n> To find previous moves: from (6,2) to (6,3) is an increase in y?

Tail is at (3,2), head at (4,3), after moving up to (4,4), new head at (4,4), tail will move? When I eat food, the tail doesn't move immediately; the snake grows, so when I move to a food cell, I eat it, so the head moves to the food, and since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail later? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows by one segment. But the growth happens after the move; so after moving, the head is on the food, and the tail remains in place, but since it grew, the tail doesn't advance this turn. Let me clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: when eating positive food, length of snake +1. So when head moves onto food, it eats it, and the snake grows, meaning that the tail doesn't move on that turn. So the new position: head is on the food, and all body segments remain, so the snake is longer.\n> \n> In terms of movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to new cell (food), and the tail does not move, so the body stays, and new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> Typically: when food is eaten, after the head moves to the food cell, the tail does not advance, so the snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to food, the new head position is food, and all body segments remain where they are, so the tail stays, and the new segment is effectively added at the tail position for the next move.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after moving, the head is at new position, body includes all previous positions except that tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail is still there, and head might collide with it only if it moves onto it, but since tail didn't move, if head moves to a cell adjacent or something.\n> \n> But in this case, after moving to (4,4), head at (4,4), body was (4,3), (5,3), etc., but since food eaten, tail (3,2) does not move, so body positions: head at (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and tail (3,2) still there? No.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> Before move: positions: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (3,1), 8: tail (3,2)\n> \n> After move, if I move to (4,4) and eat food:\n> \n> Head moves to (4,4)\n> \n> Since food eaten, the tail does not advance, so the body segments: segment 1 moves to where head was (4,3), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was (5,3), ..., segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was (3,1)?

It's turn 34, and I'm the snake AI. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells go from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0, x=7, or y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Therefore, the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Similarly, food should be within this area.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,6)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2).

For example, at turn t, life span N, after this turn, at turn t+1, life span is N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So for (1,3): life span 2 at turn 34, so after turn 34, life span becomes 1 at turn 35, then after turn 35, it disappears, so it can be eaten only on turn 34 or 35.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): life span 4 at turn 34, so available until turn 37 (since after turn 37, it would be gone).\n> \n> Life span N at turn t means:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span N-1, can be eaten if not eaten\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t+N-1: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn t+N-1, it disappears, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> So for (1,3): N=2, available on turn 34 and 35, gone after turn 35.\n> \n> (4,6): N=4, available on turns 34,35,36,37, gone after turn 37.\n> \n> (6,5): N=10, available for many turns.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly.

Let's see the direction.\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y increases upwards. So (1,1) bottom left, (6,6) top right?

Cells adjacent to (1,3) are (1,4), (1,2), (2,3), all of which are at least distance 3 from (4,4), e.g. (2,3) is |4-2| + |4-3| =2+1=3, so 3 moves away, but I have only one move to reach such a cell, which is impossible. After one move, I can be at (3,4) etc., which is still distance 2 from (2,3) or something.\n> \n> Specifically, (2,3) is the closest, at |4-2| + |4-3| =2+1=3 from (4,4), so after one move, I can be at (3,4) which is |3-2| + |4-3| =1+1=2 from (2,3), not adjacent. So I cannot be at (2,3) or (1,4) after one move.

It's turn 35. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (4,5) from below, so previous move was Up.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span decreases each turn, including current, it will disappear after turn 35? Life span 1 means it has 1 turn left, so after turn 35, it should be gone. Let's read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food with life_span N, it appears for N turns, and countdown starts from N down to 0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? The description says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns have passed since it spawned, it's gone.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), and life_span is the remaining life, I think. Let me check the input format.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n> \n> And \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\". But life_span is given, so for (1,3,1,1), life_span=1, meaning it has 1 turn left, so after this turn (turn 35), it will disappear. Similarly, (4,6,3,1) has life_span=1, so disappears after turn 35. (6,5,9,1) has life_span=1? No: \" (6, 5, 9, 1) \" – value is 9? Let's see: \" (x2,y2), value2, life_span2\" so (6,5,9,1) means position (6,5), value 9, life span 1. But life span 1 means it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> All food has life span 1? That can't be right. Let me read:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (1, 3, 1, 1)\n> - (4, 6, 3, 1)\n> - (6, 5, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> So for (1,3): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (4,6): value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> (6,5): value=9, life_span=1\n> \n> All have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. So on turn 35, if I move to one, I can eat it, but after turn 35, they are gone.\n> \n> Life_span=1: countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 35, life_span=1, after this turn, it becomes 0 and disappears. So I can eat it only on this turn if I move to it.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But there are three foods, all with value positive: +1, +3, +9, all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,5), direction Up.

It's turn 36, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is Up, so currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (6,5) with value 1 and life span 9. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 9 more turns, so by turn 45 it should be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The goal is to eat positive food and avoid negative food, but here there's only one food, and it's positive with value 1.\n> \n> Since the food is at (6,5), and my head is at (4,6), moving Up would take me to (4,7), but y=7 is a wall, so I can't move Up because that would hit the wall. Head direction is U, but moving U from (4,6) to (4,7) is invalid since y=7 is a border wall.\n> \n> Available moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but need to check for walls, body collisions, and also the no instant reverse rule. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D immediately, as that would be reverse.\n> \n> Possible actions from (4,6):\n> \n> - U: to (4,7) – but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (4,5) – but (4,5) is a body segment. Snake positions: (4,6) head, then (4,5), (4,4), etc. So (4,5) is the second segment. If I move to (4,5), that would be a body collision, which is deadly. So I cannot move D because it would hit the body at (4,5).\n> \n> - L: to (3,6) – now, (3,6) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacles. Walls: border cells and internal obstacles: [(3,6)]. So (3,6) is a wall, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: to (5,6) – is this free?

Walls: x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,6). So (5,6) should be free.\n> \n> Coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (5,6): x=5, y=6, which is within bounds, not a border wall, and not (3,6), so yes, (5,6) is empty.\n> \n> So the only possible move from (4,6) is R, to (5,6).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.

Snake body: after moving to (5,6), the snake positions will be: head (5,6), then previous head (4,6) becomes body, so body: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). Tail is at (3,1), but since we move, the tail will move when we eat food or not.\n> \n> When we move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves away from the last position if no food eaten. Since we didn't eat food, the tail will be removed, so the body shifts.\n> \n> After moving to (5,6) without eating, new positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). The tail (3,1) is removed, so positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]? Length is 11, after move without eating, length same, so tail removed: original positions had 11 segments, after moving head to (5,6), the body includes the old head (4,6) and so on, but the last segment (3,1) is removed, so the new tail is (4,1) or what?\n> \n> List of positions before move: index 0: (4,6) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1) tail.\n> \n> After move to (5,6), head is now (5,6), and body segments: the previous head (4,6) becomes segment 1, then (4,5) segment 2, ..., up to (4,1) segment 9, and (3,1) is no longer part of snake since tail moves. So positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). (4,1) is now the tail?

Current positions: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So (5,5) is not in this list, and not a wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> - L: (4,6) - but (4,6) is now a body segment, position index 1, so moving to (4,6) would be body collision, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (6,6) - (6,6) is not occupied, not wall, so free.\n> \n> So from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to get to the food at (6,5). Also, life span 9, so from turn 36, it has 9 turns left. After turn 36 move, it will be turn 37, and life span decreases, so at turn 37, food at (6,5) has life span 8 left, and so on.\n> \n> Since I moved to (5,6) at turn 36, at turn 37 I can go to (6,6) or (5,5).\n> \n> If I go to (6,6), then from there I can go down to (6,5) to eat the food, but (6,5) is the food position.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> First, let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> Option A: Move R to (6,6) at turn 37.\n> \n> Then from (6,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> U: (6,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (6,5) - this is the food.

After moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc. (5,6) is segment 1, so moving L to (5,6) would be body collision.\n> \n> R: (7,6) - x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So from (6,6), only possible move is D to (6,5), which has food.\n> \n> If I move to (6,5) at turn 38, I eat the food.\n> \n> Now, what happens when I eat? The snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and I gain +1 score and length increases.\n> \n> But I need to check for dangers after eating.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, when I eat at (6,5), the tail is currently at (4,1), which is far away, so no issue.\n> \n> After eating, new positions: head at (6,5), and the body includes the previous positions without removing the tail, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Current before eating: if at turn 37 I moved to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail.

Tail is (5,1).\n> \n> Now, at turn 38, move D to (6,5): (6,5) has food, so I eat it. Head moves to (6,5), and the tail doesn't move, so body becomes: (6,5) head, then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). And since I ate, a new segment is added at the tail, but the tail position stays, so the new tail is still (5,1)? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the body gains one segment.

No: position 2 was (4,5), it moves to where position 1 was, which is (4,6) but (4,6) is now occupied by head, so position 2 moves to (4,6)? Messy.\n> \n> Better to think of the list shifting.\n> \n> Old positions: idx 0: (5,6), idx 1: (4,6), idx 2: (4,5), idx 3: (4,4), ..., idx 10: (4,1)\n> \n> After moving head left to (4,6):\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - The body segment that was idx 1 needs a new position. It moves to the position that was previously idx 0, which is (5,6)\n> \n> - Then idx 2 moves to where idx 1 was, which is (4,6) but (4,6) is now head, so it should move to (4,6)? No.\n> \n> Standard: the body segments each move to the position of the preceding segment in the previous state.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New idx 0: (4,6)  // new head position\n> \n> - New idx 1: old idx 0 position, which is (5,6)  // because it follows the head\n> \n> - New idx 2: old idx 1 position, which is (4,6) but (4,6) is now new head, so new idx 2 is (4,6)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> In snake movement, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed or the body shifts.\n> \n> Specifically: the head moves to a new cell. Then, if no food eaten, the tail is removed, and all body segments shift towards the tail.\n> \n> But in this case, since we're moving, and we might eat food or not.\n> \n> First, when moving, we don't eat food yet; eating happens when head moves onto food cell.\n> \n> But for collision, we need to see where the head moves relative to the body after the move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" but \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, moving left to (4,6): (4,6) is currently occupied by the first body segment (index 1).\n> \n> After moving head to (4,6), the new head is at (4,6), which was the old position of index 1.\n> \n> Then, the body: the segment that was index 1 must move to a new position. Since the head moved, the body shifts: index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (5,6).\n> \n> Then index 2 moves to where index 1 was, which is (4,6), but (4,6) is now the head, so it moves to (4,6)? That would mean index 2 is at (4,6), but head is also at (4,6), collision.\n> \n> But that can't be right; I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Let's think differently.\n> \n> The snake is a sequence of cells. When the head moves to a new cell, that new cell becomes the new head position. Then, each subsequent body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list, so the tail position is vacated unless the snake grows.\n> \n> But when the head moves to a cell that was occupied by the body, it depends on which body segment.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to the cell that is currently the position of the neck (index 1), then after the move, the neck will have moved to the old head position, so the new head and the new neck are at different positions, no collision.\n> \n> Example:\n> \n> Old positions: H: (5,6), B1: (4,6), B2: (4,5), ...\n> \n> Move head to (4,6) (left).\n> \n> New head: (4,6)\n> \n> Then B1 moves to where H was: (5,6)\n> \n> Then B2 moves to where B1 was: (4,6) but (4,6) is now the new head position, so B2 would move to (4,6), which is occupied by head, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's a problem. So moving directly into the neck causes a collision because the body segment that was there moves away, but the next segment moves into that spot.\n> \n> However, for the tail, it's different.\n> \n> Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for the tail, when you move to the tail cell, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But for other body segments, it might cause collision.\n> \n> In this case, (4,6) is B1, the first body segment, not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,1), far away.\n> \n> So moving to (4,6) would cause a collision with B2 moving to that spot.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to any body segment except the tail, it might cause collision if the segment moves into it or something.\n> \n> General rule: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it will collide because after the move, that segment moves away, but the segment behind it moves to that cell, and the head is there, so collision.\n> \n> Only if it's the tail, the tail moves away and no segment moves to that cell if the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> But if the snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, which can cause issues.\n> \n> But for now, no food eaten in this move.\n> \n> So from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) is invalid because it causes collision with the body.\n> \n> Moving up to (5,7): y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving down to (5,5): (5,5) is currently empty? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So (5,5) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (6,6): (6,6) not in list, empty.\n> \n> (6,6) is x=6,y=6, which is within bounds, not wall.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,6) is fine.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), but (6,6) not affected.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,6):\n> \n> - U: to (5,7) invalid, wall\n> \n> - D: to (5,5) valid, empty\n> \n> - L: to (4,6) invalid, body collision (as explained)\n> \n> - R: to (6,6) valid, empty\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse issue since current direction R, moving R or D or U, but U invalid, so only R and D possible? L is opposite, but we can't move L anyway due to body.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction, so since head direction is R, I cannot move L (left). So even if (4,6) were empty, I couldn't move left because of the rule. But here it's occupied, so double invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: right to (6,6) or down to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, food: (6,5) and (1,6).\n> \n> (6,5) is at x=6,y=5. From (5,6), to get to (6,5), I need to move down-right or something, but I can only move one step at a time.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, so left several steps.\n> \n> Now, life span: (6,5) has life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 37 + 8 - 1? Turn t1=37, life span N=8, disappears after N turns, including current, so after turn 37, it has 7 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,5) with life span 8, on turn 37, countdown is 8, which includes turn 37. After turn 37, countdown becomes 7, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> Typically, it means that the food is present for N turns starting from when it spawned, but here life span is given as remaining, I think.\n> \n> In the state: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and life_span is the remaining life span, I believe, since it decreases every turn.\n> \n> In the input: \" (6, 5, 8, 1) \" so (x,y, life_span, value), value=1.\n> \n> Life span 8 means it has 8 turns left, including the current turn. So after this turn (turn 37), it will have 7 turns left, and so on, until turn 37 + 7 = turn 44, it will be gone after turn 44? Let's see.\n> \n> If on turn 37, life span 8, after turn 37, it decreases to 7, so on turn 38, life span 7, ..., on turn 44, life span 1, after turn 44, it disappears, so last chance to eat it is on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,6) life span 10, last chance turn 37+9=46? Turn 37: life 10, after turn 37: life 9, turn 38: life 8, ..., turn 46: life 1, after turn 46 gone, so eat by turn 46.\n> \n> But we need to plan moves.\n> \n> Now, back to possible actions at turn 37: move to (6,6) or (5,5).\n> \n> If I move right to (6,6), that's not food, so snake doesn't grow, head moves to (6,6), body shifts, tail moves away.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,6), then (5,6) old head, then (4,6), but (4,6) was body, now moves to (5,6)? Let's list:\n> \n> Old: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> Move head to (6,6) (right)\n> \n> New head: (6,6)\n> \n> Then new body: first segment: old head position (5,6)\n> \n> Then second: old first body position (4,6)\n> \n> Then third: old second body position (4,5)\n> \n> And so on, down to tail: old tail position (4,1) is vacated, so new tail is at (5,1)?

After move, new head at (5,6), then body: first segment moves to old head (6,6), then second to old first body (5,6) but (5,6) is now head, so conflict? Same issue.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to (5,6), new head (5,6), then new body index 1: old head position (6,6), then new body index 2: old body index 1 position, which is (5,6), but (5,6) is now head, so index 2 tries to move to (5,6), collision with head.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (5,6) causes collision.\n> \n> Thus, from (6,6), only possible move is down to (6,5), which is the food.\n> \n> So if I move right on turn 37 to (6,6), then on turn 38, I must move down to (6,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> Now, eating (6,5): value +1, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n> \n> On turn 38, head moves to (6,5), which is food, so eat it, snake grows: new head at (6,5), and the tail stays, so positions: old positions after turn 37: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (6,5) and eating food: new head (6,5), then body: the segments are added, so new positions: [ (6,5) ] + the old body, but since food eaten, we don't remove the tail.\n> \n> So new: head (6,5), then (6,6) old head, then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) — and tail (5,1) remains, so 12 segments now.\n> \n> The snake was 11, after eating, length 12.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,5), direction down (since moved down from (6,6)).\n> \n> Now, from here, I need to think further.\n> \n> But first, let's see the other option for turn 37.\n> \n> Option B: Move down to (5,5) on turn 37.\n> \n> Then new positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n> \n> Tail at (5,1).\n> \n> Head direction now down.\n> \n> On turn 38, from (5,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,6) — but (5,6) is now a body segment (index 1 in current positions).\n> \n> Moving up to (5,6): similar collision issue.\n> \n> (5,6) is occupied by body, so moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> - D: to (5,4) — probably empty\n> \n> - L: to (4,5) — (4,5) is body segment?

It's turn 39. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). The snake is made up of these positions: head at (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). So the head is at (5,4) and direction is down, which is decreasing y, I think? Direction D means down, so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> In standard coordinates, y often increases upwards, but in grids, it can vary. Here, since moving down from (5,4) to (5,5) would be increasing y if y=0 is bottom, but let's see the positions: snake positions are given as [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), ...]. If head is at (5,4) and moving down to (5,5), that means y=5 is below y=4? That doesn't make sense because usually y increases as you go up. But in the movement constraints, D is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y. But in the positions, from head (5,4) to next (5,5), which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, (5,5) is above (5,4), so if head was at (5,4) and moved down to (5,5), that would be increasing y, but D is (x,y-1), which should decrease y. There's inconsistency.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So U increases y, D decreases y, L decreases x, R increases x.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), etc. If head is at (5,4) and it moved to (5,5), that would be increasing y, so that should be moving up, but current direction is D, down. Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", but from the positions, the head is at (5,4), and the next segment is (5,5), which has same x and y+1, so that means the snake moved up to get to (5,4) from (5,5)? Let's list the positions in order: head first, so position 0: (5,4), position 1: (5,5), position 2: (5,6), etc. Since it's a snake, the head moves, and the body follows. So at the previous turn, head was at some position, and it moved to (5,4).\n> \n> The direction is the current direction it's facing, which is D, down. But from the positions, the head is at (5,4), and the first body segment is at (5,5). Since the body follows, when the head moves, the tail moves away. So at turn 38, head was at (5,5), and it moved down to (5,4)? But moving down from (5,5) to (5,4) would be decreasing y to 4, which is D. Then the new head is (5,4), and the body that was at (5,5) is still there, but since the head moved, the body will shift. Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn t, snake positions: [(x_t, y_t), (x_{t-1}, y_{t-1}), ...] so head is current position, and the next is the previous head position, and so on to the tail.\n> \n> So for turn 39, positions: index 0: head (5,4), index 1: (5,5) which is where head was at turn 38, index 2: (5,6) turn 37 head, and so on.\n> \n> Direction D means that at turn 39, the snake is facing down, so it just moved down to (5,4) from (5,5) at turn 38.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense: from (5,5) at turn 38, moved D to (5,4) at turn 39.\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items.\n> \n> First: (6,5,6,1) — this should be position, value, life span. So (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? The format says: Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> \n> In the input: \"(6, 5, 6, 1)\" — that might be (x,y, life_span, value) or what? It says \" (6, 5, 6, 1) \" and \" (1, 6, 8, 1) \", but the format specifies ( (x,y), value, life_span ).\n> \n> Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 5, 6, 1) - (1, 6, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> It's a bit messy. Probably it's (x, y, life_span, value) for each, but the description says \"Value and Life Span\", and in the list, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value)? No, let's see the text: \" (6, 5, 6, 1) \" and it says \"Life Span and Value\", so likely (x,y, life_span, value).\n> \n> But in the core rules, it's ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but here it's listed differently. I think for this state, (6,5,6,1) means x=6, y=5, life_span=6, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6,8,1) means x=1, y=6, life_span=8, value=1.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value=1.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,5) it's 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so it has 6 turns left including turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) has life span 8.\n> \n> Current turn t1=39.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly y. But walls occupy x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so walls at all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So boundaries are walls.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) which is obstacle.\n> \n> x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (3,6) is occupied by wall? No, internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are separate from borders.\n> \n> So cells: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So the grid is 8x8, with walls on the border.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is within the grid, so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: list with head at (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1).\n> \n> So let's plot these:\n> \n> Head: (5,4)\n> \n> Body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> Tail is (6,1)\n> \n> Food at (6,5) and (1,6)\n> \n> Current direction: D (down), so head just moved to (5,4) from (5,5) by moving down.\n> \n> Now, possible actions: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because no instant reverse. Moving opposite to current direction is not allowed, so from D, I cannot move U immediately.\n> \n> Allowed moves: L, R, or D (since not reversing).\n> \n> Now, let's see the surroundings of head (5,4).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L): (x-1,y) = (4,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): (x+1,y) = (6,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): (x,y-1) = (5,3)\n> \n> - Up (U) is not allowed since reverse.\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are safe.\n> \n> First, (4,4): is it occupied by snake or wall?\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,4) is in the list, it's the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,4), yes, (4,4) is a body segment.\n> \n> So moving to (4,4) would collide with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): (x,y-1) = (5,3), which is also in snake positions, index 7: (5,3), body segment.\n> \n> (6,4): (x+1,y) = (6,4), is this occupied?\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc. (6,4) is not listed. Walls: x=6, y=4, x=6 is not wall, y=4 not wall, so (6,4) should be free.\n> \n> But is it a wall? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (3,6). (6,4) is not any of those, so empty.\n> \n> Food: (6,5) and (1,6), not (6,4).\n> \n> So moving R to (6,4) seems possible.\n> \n> But let's confirm all options:\n> \n> - L to (4,4): occupied by body, unsafe.\n> \n> - D to (5,3): occupied by body (5,3) is index 7, unsafe.\n> \n> - U to (5,5): but U is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> - R to (6,4): empty, safe.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (6,4)? But is there no other? What about staying or something, no, must move.\n> \n> But let's list adjacent cells:\n> \n> North: (5,5) - occupied by snake body\n> \n> South: (5,3) - occupied by snake body\n> \n> East: (6,4) - free\n> \n> West: (4,4) - occupied by snake body\n> \n> So indeed, only east (R) is safe to move.\n> \n> But current direction is D, and R is perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> So for turn 39, I must move R to (6,4).\n> \n> The action is for the current turn, but the state is given at turn 39, so I need to choose action for turn 39, which will move to a new position.\n> \n> The answer should start from turn 39 action.\n> \n> In the state, it's turn t1=39, and I need to output actions starting from turn 39.\n> \n> So for turn 39, action must be R.\n> \n> But let's think ahead. After moving to (6,4), what next?\n> \n> Also, food: there is food at (6,5), which is above (6,4), and at (1,6) far away.\n> \n> Life span: food at (6,5) has life span 6 at turn 39, so it disappears after 6 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 44 or 45? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 39, life span 6, then turn 40:5, 41:4, 42:3, 43:2, 44:1, 45:0 or gone? The rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn 39, life span 6, so it will be present for 6 turns: from turn 39 to 44, and disappear at turn 45? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be there until turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, L=1, it disappears after 1 turn, so it can be eaten at turn t, but not at turn t+1. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown L, after turn t, countdown L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn when it appears or when? For a food with life span N, at the turn it is spawned, countdown=N, and each turn, countdown decreases by 1, when countdown=0, it disappears after that turn, I think.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: at turn t, if countdown is C, it will disappear at the end of turn t + C - 1 or something.\n> \n> But to avoid confusion, let's think in terms of turns left.\n> \n> At turn 39, food at (6,5) has life span 6, so it has 6 turns left including this turn. So it can be eaten from turn 39 to 44, and disappears at turn 45.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,6) has life span 8, so turns 39 to 46, disappears at turn 47.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake.\n> \n> After moving R to (6,4) at turn 39, new head position (6,4).\n> \n> Direction: since I moved right, new direction is R.\n> \n> Snake body: the head moves to (6,4), and the tail will move away. Current positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]\n> \n> After move R: head to (6,4), then the body: the segment that was at (5,4) moves to where the head was? No.\n> \n> When head moves, the body shifts: the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on, tail moves off or stays if food eaten, but no food eaten here.\n> \n> Since no food, length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,4), then body: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2) — and tail (6,1) is gone, since no growth.\n> \n> Old tail was (6,1), after move, it is removed, so new tail is (6,2)? Let's list:\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4), the body segments: the previous head (5,4) becomes the new first body segment, then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2). The (6,1) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2) — that's 11 segments? Original 11 positions, head moved, tail removed, so 11 segments still? Original: 11 positions, after move: new head + 10 body segments from previous positions except tail removed.\n> \n> Previous positions: 11 cells.\n> \n> After move: head at new position (6,4), and the body consists of the first 10 positions of the old list, shifted: so old positions 0 to 9 become body segments 1 to 10? Positions indexed from 0.\n> \n> Old: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), 10: (6,1) tail.\n> \n> After move R to (6,4): new head at (6,4)\n> \n> New body: the old head becomes segment 1: (5,4)\n> \n> Then old segment 1 becomes new segment 2: (5,5)\n> \n> Old segment 2: new segment 3: (5,6)\n> \n> Old segment 3: new segment 4: (4,6)\n> \n> Old segment 4: new segment 5: (4,5)\n> \n> Old segment 5: new segment 6: (4,4)\n> \n> Old segment 6: new segment 7: (4,3)\n> \n> Old segment 7: new segment 8: (5,3)\n> \n> Old segment 8: new segment 9: (6,3)\n> \n> Old segment 9: new segment 10: (6,2)\n> \n> Old segment 10: (6,1) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2)\n> \n> Tail at (6,2)\n> \n> Now, direction is R (right).\n> \n> From here, possible moves for turn 40.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), direction R.\n> \n> Can move: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1). Cannot move L (left) because reverse.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (6,5) - this has food? Food at (6,5) is present, value +1.\n> \n> - D: (6,3) - but (6,3) is part of snake, it's the 9th segment? New positions: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2) tail.\n> \n> So (6,3) is index 9, body segment.\n> \n> - R: (7,4) - but x=7 is wall, so cannot move, deadly.\n> \n> - L: not allowed, reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,5) or D to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied, so only U to (6,5) is possible? D to (6,3) is body, unsafe.\n> \n> U to (6,5): is it safe? (6,5) is not snake body, not wall, but has food.\n> \n> If I move to (6,5), I eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> Food at (6,5) is positive, value +1, so snake grows.\n> \n> But need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, is (6,5) occupied? Currently, not by snake, as per positions.\n> \n> Walls: no.\n> \n> So moving to (6,5) should be safe, and I eat the food.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Here, tail is at (6,2), head is at (6,4), moving to (6,5).\n> \n> After eating, what happens?\n> \n> If I eat at (6,5), the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Current tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> After move to (6,5), head at (6,5), then body: old head (6,4) becomes segment 1, and so on, up to old segment 9: (6,3), and old tail (6,2) remains because of growth, so new tail is still (6,2)? Let's see.\n> \n> Without growth: if no food, head to (6,5), body: (6,4), (5,4), ..., down to (6,3), and tail (6,2) removed.\n> \n> But with food eaten, length increases, so tail not removed.\n> \n> So positions after eating: head at (6,5), body: old head (6,4), then old body 1 to 10: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), and old tail (6,2) remains as new last body segment.\n> \n> Old segments: before move, head (6,4), body 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), ..., 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2)\n> \n> After moving to (6,5) with food eaten: new head (6,5), new body segment 1: (6,4) [old head], segment 2: (5,4) [old body1], ..., segment 11: (6,3) [old body9], segment 12: (6,2) [old body10/tail, now kept]\n> \n> So tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> Now, head at (6,5), tail at (6,2).\n> \n> Is head adjacent to tail?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, so the segment that was at position 1 moves to where head was, position 2 moves to where position 1 was, and so on, down to tail.\n> \n> If no food, the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, the tail does not vacate, so the snake grows by one cell; the new head position is added, and all body segments move, so the last segment (tail) stays, and a new segment is effectively added at the tail end.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving and eating, the body segments include the previous positions plus the head moves, so the tail remains.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move without eating: head to new, seg1 to old head, seg2 to old seg1, ..., tail to old second last, so tail cell is free.\n> \n> After move with eating: head to new, seg1 to old head, seg2 to old seg1, ..., tail stays where it is, and the old tail position is still occupied, so snake length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,5), which has food, I eat it.\n> \n> Current positions: (6,4) head, then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (6,5). Since (6,5) has food, eaten, so new positions: head at (6,5), then body: old head (6,4) becomes first body segment, then (5,4) becomes second, (5,5) becomes third, ..., up to (6,3) becomes tenth body segment, and tail (6,2) remains as tail, but since eaten, tail doesn't move, so (6,2) is still tail, and snake has 12 segments now?

There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n2. **Snake Position**: The snake's head is at (6,6), and its body segments follow in this order: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)].\n3. **Head Direction**: The snake's head is currently facing \"U\" (Up).\n4. **Food**: There are two pieces of positive food:\n   - (1,6) with a lifespan of 5 turns and value +1.\n   - (2,4) with a lifespan of 8 turns and value +1.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nGiven the snake's head is at (6,6) and facing Up, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: Move to (6,7).\n- **Left (L)**: Move to (5,6).\n- **Right (R)**: Move to (7,6).\n- **Down (D)**: Not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (U).\n\nBut we need to check the validity of each move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,7)\n   - y=7 is a wall. **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n2. **Right (R)**: (7,6)\n   - x=7 is a wall. **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,6)\n   - Check if (5,6) is occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Looking at the snake's positions: (5,6) is the 6th segment (index 5).\n   - According to the rules, moving into a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail is deadly.\n   - The tail is at (6,3), so (5,6) is not the tail. **Invalid** (collision with body).\n4. **Down (D)**: (6,5)\n   - Even though it's the opposite direction, the rules say we can't do an instant reverse.\n   - But, is it allowed? The current direction is U, and D is the opposite. **Invalid** (instant reverse not allowed).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll possible moves from the current position lead to a collision:\n- Up: Wall.\n- Right: Wall.\n- Left: Body segment.\n- Down: Not allowed (instant reverse).\n\n### Verification\n\nLooking at the snake's body positions:\n- Adjacent to the head (6,6):\n  - (6,5): Occupied by the first body segment (6,5).\n  - (5,6): Occupied by the fifth body segment (5,6).\n  - (6,7) and (7,6): Walls.\n\nThe only exception is the tail, which is at (6,3), not adjacent to the head. Therefore, no safe moves are available.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all possible moves lead to a collision, the snake has no safe move. However, the problem requires an action. Among the invalid options, moving Left (L) to (5,6) is a choice, but it results in a collision with the body segment at (5,6).\n\n### Answer\n\n\\boxed{L} \n\n**Note**: This move results in a collision with the body segment at (5,6), ending the game. The snake is trapped with no safe moves available.",
