        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Grid**: It's a 2D grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n2. **Snake**: \n   - Current position: Only the head at (3, 3).\n   - Direction: Currently moving Left (L).\n3. **Food**: \n   - Three pieces of food:\n     - (1, 4) with value +1 and life_span 10.\n     - (1, 2) with value +1 and life_span 10.\n     - (6, 6) with value +1 and life_span 10.\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- The snake has no body segments yet, just a head at (3, 3).\n- The current direction is Left (L), meaning the head is moving towards decreasing x-coordinate.\n- Since the snake is only one segment long, the \"no instant reverse\" rule is less restrictive because there's no body to collide with.\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule, since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot immediately move Right (R).\n\n**Valid moves**: U, D, L.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Continue Left (L)\n- New position: (2, 3).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a border, but (2, 3) is not a wall.\n  - Obstacles: (3, 2) is an obstacle, but (2, 3) is not.\n  - Body: No body segments to collide with.\n- Food: No food at (2, 3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New position: (3, 4).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a border, but (3, 4) is safe.\n  - Obstacles: (3, 2) is not in the path.\n  - Body: No body segments.\n- Food: No food at (3, 4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New position: (3, 2).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a border, but (3, 2) is safe.\n  - Obstacles: There's an obstacle at (3, 2).\n  - **Collision**: The snake would hit the obstacle.\n- **Outcome**: Deadly move. Not viable.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nSince the snake is alone, it's safe to consider moving towards food to increase the score. Let's see the positions:\n\n1. (1, 4): To reach here from (3, 3), the snake needs to move Left twice and then Up once.\n   - First move: Left to (2, 3).\n   - Second move: Left to (1, 3).\n   - Third move: Up to (1, 4).\n   - But the food's life_span is 10, and we're at turn 0. It's safe.\n\n2. (1, 2): Similar to above but Down after Left.\n   - First move: Left to (2, 3).\n   - Second move: Left to (1, 3).\n   - Third move: Down to (1, 2).\n   - Also within life_span.\n\n3. (6, 6): Far away, but possible.\n   - First move: Right is not allowed due to current direction being Left.\n   - Need to change direction first.\n\n### Strategy\n\nGiven the options, the closest food is (1, 4) and (1, 2). Both require moving Left first.\n\n- **First move**: Left to (2, 3).\n- **Second move**: Can decide based on whether to go Up or Down.\n\nSince both options are viable, but (1, 4) is Up and (1, 2) is Down, but Down is blocked by an obstacle at (3, 2). However, after moving Left, the obstacle is not in the way.\n\nBut for the immediate turn, the best action is to move Left towards the food.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\n- **Left**: As established, safe.\n- **Up**: Safe but doesn't immediately help in reaching food.\n- **Down**: Leads to collision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to continue moving Left to position (2, 3), setting up a path towards either (1, 4) or (1, 2).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However, since the snake is moving left, it cannot instantly reverse to right (R) on the next turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is L, the possible moves are U, D, and L (since R is the opposite of L and is not allowed).\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (1,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (1,3) is not a wall.\n  - Obstacles: (3,2) is an obstacle, but (1,3) is not (3,2).\n  - Body: Only one segment, so no body collision.\n- Food: No food at (1,3).\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (2,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a wall, but (2,4) is safe.\n  - Obstacles: (3,2) is not (2,4).\n  - Body: No body collision.\n- Food: No food at (2,4).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (2,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (2,2) is safe.\n  - Obstacles: (3,2) is not (2,2).\n  - Body: No body collision.\n- Food: No food at (2,2).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. (1,4): To reach here, the snake needs to move left to (1,3) and then up to (1,4).\n2. (1,2): Move left to (1,3) and then down to (1,2).\n3. (6,6) and (6,5): These are far away and would require multiple moves.\n\nGiven the life_span of all foods is 1, they will disappear after this turn. So, the snake must reach the food in this turn to eat it.\n\nBut, the snake can only move one cell per turn. Therefore, none of the food items are adjacent to the current head position (2,3). The closest foods are (1,4) and (1,2), but they are two moves away.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince none of the food items are adjacent to the current head position, the snake cannot eat any food in this turn. Therefore, the priority is to avoid collisions and position itself for future food.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\n- **Move Left (L)**: Moves towards (1,4) and (1,2). It's a safe move and positions the snake closer to potential food.\n- **Move Up (U)**: Moves away from the closest food.\n- **Move Down (D)**: Moves towards (1,2) but less directly than moving left first.\n\n**Best option**: Move Left (L), as it positions the snake closer to the nearest food items.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Collision Check**: As established, moving left is safe.\n- **Future Moves**: After moving left to (1,3), next turn the snake can move up to (1,4) or down to (1,2) to eat the food, provided the food's life_span is extended.\n\nHowever, since the food's life_span is 1, they will disappear after this turn. Thus, the snake cannot eat any food this turn, but moving left is still a safe move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the constraints and the current state, the best immediate action is to continue moving left, as it's safe and maintains the current trajectory.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the Snake game:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: These are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (3, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Currently, the snake has only one segment at [(1, 3)], meaning the head is at (1, 3) and there's no body (length = 1).\n   - **Direction**: The head is moving Left (\"L\").\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (1, 4): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - (1, 2): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 6): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- The snake is currently of length 1, meaning it's just the head. There's no body to collide with except itself, but since length is 1, self-collision isn't possible yet.\n- The head is at (1, 3) moving Left (\"L\"). From the rules, the snake cannot instantly reverse its direction, so it cannot move Right (\"R\") in the next turn.\n- Possible moves from current direction (Left) without reversing: Up (\"U\"), Down (\"D\"), or continue Left (\"L\").\n  \n### Possible Moves and Their Consequences\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Left (\"L\")**:\n   - Current head: (1, 3)\n   - New head position: (1 - 1, 3) = (0, 3)\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a border wall. Moving to (0, 3) would collide with the wall → **Death**.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Move Up (\"U\")**:\n   - Current head: (1, 3)\n   - New head position: (1, 3 + 1) = (1, 4)\n   - Check for walls: y=4 is not a wall.\n   - Check for food: There's food at (1, 4) with value 8 (positive).\n     - Since the snake's length is 1, the tail is at (1, 3), which will move away when the head moves to (1, 4).\n     - After eating, length becomes 2, new tail will be at (1, 3).\n     - Is there a \"Tail Reward Danger\"? \n       - After eating, head is at (1, 4), new tail at (1, 3). These are adjacent (one cell apart vertically). \n       - The rule states: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n       - Here, after eating, the tail is at (1, 3), but there's no food at (1, 3) now (food was at (1, 4)). So no danger.\n   - **Valid move**, can eat positive food, gain +1 score, length increases to 2.\n\n3. **Move Down (\"D\")**:\n   - Current head: (1, 3)\n   - New head position: (1, 3 - 1) = (1, 2)\n   - Check for walls: y=2 is not a wall.\n   - Check for food: There's food at (1, 2) with value 8 (positive).\n     - Similar to \"U\", length is 1, tail moves away, new length is 2.\n     - After eating, head at (1, 2), tail at (1, 3).\n     - Check adjacency: head at (1, 2), tail at (1, 3) are adjacent.\n     - Is there food at tail (1, 3)? No, current food is at (1, 2), (1, 4), (6,6), (6,5).\n     - No \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - **Valid move**, can eat positive food, gain +1 score, length increases to 2.\n\n4. **Move Right (\"R\")**:\n   - Current direction is Left (\"L\"), moving Right is instant reverse → **Invalid move** by rules.\n\n### Comparing Valid Moves\n\nBoth \"U\" and \"D\" are valid moves leading to eating positive food without immediate death. Now, let's see if one is better than the other:\n\n- **Move Up (\"U\")**:\n  - Eats food at (1, 4), value 8, life_span 1.\n  - After move: head at (1, 4), tail at (1, 3).\n  - Next possible moves: Cannot reverse to \"D\", can move \"U\", \"L\", \"R\".\n    - \"U\": (1, 5) - check walls: y=5 is not a wall, no food there.\n    - \"L\": (0, 4) - x=0 is wall → death.\n    - \"R\": (2, 4) - no wall, no food.\n  - Future options limited after this move.\n\n- **Move Down (\"D\")**:\n  - Eats food at (1, 2), value 8, life_span 1.\n  - After move: head at (1, 2), tail at (1, 3).\n  - Next possible moves: Cannot reverse to \"U\", can move \"D\", \"L\", \"R\".\n    - \"D\": (1, 1) - no wall, no food.\n    - \"L\": (0, 2) - x=0 is wall → death.\n    - \"R\": (2, 2) - no wall, no food.\n  - Similarly limited future options.\n\nBoth moves seem equally good in terms of immediate gain. However, let's look at the food positions:\n\n- Food at (1, 4) and (1, 2) both have life_span 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n- Other foods are at (6,6) and (6,5), which are far and not reachable immediately.\n- Since both nearby foods will disappear after this turn, we must choose one to eat now.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince both \"U\" and \"D\" are equally valid in terms of immediate gain and future options are similarly limited, we can choose either. There's no additional information suggesting one is better than the other (like future planning from a Thinking Model). \n\nHowever, moving \"U\" to (1,4) might be slightly better because:\n- After eating at (1,4), the next move could be \"U\" to (1,5), then possibly \"R\" towards the other foods at (6,6) and (6,5).\n- Moving \"D\" to (1,2) would lead to \"D\" to (1,1), moving away from other foods.\n\nBut since we're only deciding the immediate action and not planning ahead, both are acceptable. \n\nGiven that, and since the rules specify to act as a \"non-thinking executor,\" we can choose either. For the sake of making a choice, let's go with \"U\".\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Danger\n\nAfter moving \"U\":\n- Head at (1,4), tail at (1,3).\n- They are adjacent, but no food is at the tail (1,3), so no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n- No collision with body (length is 2, only head and tail, which are not overlapping).\n- No wall collision.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, the safest and most rewarding immediate action is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: At (3, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (1, 4), body segment at (1, 3). So, the snake is currently two segments long.\n   - **Direction**: The head is moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards (increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food**:\n   - At (1, 2): value = +1, life_span = 7.\n   - At (6, 6): value = +1, life_span = 7.\n   - At (6, 5): value = +1, life_span = 8.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (1, 4) and direction \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (1, 5)\n- **Down (D)**: (1, 3) — but this is the body segment, so it's a collision unless it's the tail (which it is, but we need to check if it's safe).\n- **Left (L)**: (0, 4) — x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (2, 4)\n\nHowever, there's a rule about **no instant reverse**: You cannot move in the opposite direction of the current head direction in the next turn. Since the current direction is \"U\", the opposite is \"D\". So, moving \"D\" is not allowed unless it's the only option (but it's not, as we'll see).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (1, 5)**:\n   - Check walls: y=5 is within bounds (y=7 is the max), x=1 is not a wall.\n   - Check body: The body is at (1, 3), so (1, 5) is safe.\n   - Check food: No food at (1, 5).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Right (R) to (2, 4)**:\n   - Check walls: x=2 is within bounds, y=4 is not a wall.\n   - Check body: No body segment at (2, 4).\n   - Check food: No food at (2, 4).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (1, 3)**:\n   - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we have to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - The tail is at (1, 3), and there's positive food at (1, 2), which is adjacent to the tail (since (1,2) is directly below (1,3)).\n     - If we move down to (1,3), the tail moves to (1,2) (eating the food), and the head moves to (1,3). Then, the new tail would be at (1,2), and the head is at (1,3). The next move could be down to (1,2), causing a collision with the new tail.\n     - However, the rule states that eating the food when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food is deadly because the head and newly grown tail will collide. Here, the tail is at (1,3), and the food is at (1,2), which is adjacent to the tail. If we move down, the head goes to (1,3), the tail moves to (1,2) (eating the food), and the snake grows. Then, the new tail is at (1,2), and the head is at (1,3). Next move down would collide with the tail.\n     - But the rule seems to imply that the collision happens immediately after eating, not necessarily in the next move. It's a bit unclear, but it's safer to avoid moving down to prevent potential immediate collision after growth.\n   - Also, moving down is the reverse of current direction \"U\", which is not allowed unless no other options exist.\n   - Outcome: Not safe due to potential collision and reverse move restriction.\n\n4. **Left (L) to (0, 4)**:\n   - x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n   - Outcome: Invalid move.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nCurrently, the food positions are:\n- (1, 2): Below the tail at (1,3). Eating it would require moving the tail away first, which isn't immediately possible.\n- (6, 6) and (6, 5): Far from the current head position. Not reachable in the next move.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above, the safe moves are:\n- Up (U) to (1, 5)\n- Right (R) to (2, 4)\n\nBetween these, moving right seems better because:\n- Moving up doesn't bring us closer to any food.\n- Moving right opens up more space and potential paths towards the food at (6,6) or (6,5) in future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately?\n- The food at (1,2) is under the body (tail at (1,3)), but to eat it:\n  - The tail must move away first (which would happen if the head moves right or up, but not down).\n  - Then, the head would need to move onto (1,2) in a subsequent move.\n- Currently, no food can be eaten in the immediate next move.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nMoving right to (2,4) seems safe and doesn't lead to immediate dead ends. From (2,4), the snake can then move up, down, or right (left would go back to (1,4), which is the previous position).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all considerations, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 4\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7 (left and right boundaries), y=0, y=7 (bottom and top boundaries).\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 2) — this is a single cell that's blocked.\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (2, 4)\n   - Body segment: (1, 4)\n   - So, the snake is currently two segments long: head at (2,4) and tail at (1,4).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: R (right). This means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (1, 2): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - (6, 5): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (1, 6): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\nAll food items are positive (value = +1), and none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,4) and current direction R (right), the possible moves are:\n\n- **U (Up)**: (2, 4) → (2, 5)\n- **D (Down)**: (2, 4) → (2, 3)\n- **L (Left)**: (2, 4) → (1, 4)\n- **R (Right)**: (2, 4) → (3, 4)\n\nBut we have to consider movement constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the opposite direction is L. So, we cannot move L in the next turn. Therefore, L is invalid.\n   \n   Valid moves: U, D, R\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - U (2,5): Check if (2,5) is a wall or obstacle.\n     - Border walls: y=7 is the top, y=0 is the bottom. y=5 is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (3,2) — not (2,5).

(1,6)\n\nFrom head at (2,4):\n\n- Distance to (1,2): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Distance to (6,6): |2-6| + |4-6| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- Distance to (6,5): |2-6| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- Distance to (1,6): |2-1| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nClosest foods are (1,2) and (1,6), both distance 3.\n\nNow, let's see how our moves affect our path to these foods.\n\n**Option 1: U (2,5)**\n- New head: (2,5)\n- Now, distance to (1,6): |2-1| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2 (closer)\n- Distance to (1,2): |2-1| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4 (farther)\n  \nMoving up gets us closer to (1,6).\n\n**Option 2: D (2,3)**\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Distance to (1,2): |2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 (closer)\n- Distance to (1,6): |2-1| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4 (farther)\n  \nMoving down gets us closer to (1,2).\n\n**Option 3: R (3,4)**\n- New head: (3,4)\n- Distance to (1,2): |3-1| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- Distance to (1,6): |3-1| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- Distance to (6,6): |3-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- Distance to (6,5): |3-6| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4\n  \nMoving right doesn't immediately get us closer to any food; distances stay the same or increase.\n\nSo, U and D seem better for approaching food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs any food directly reachable in one move?\n\nFrom (2,4), adjacent cells are:\n- U: (2,5) — no food there.\n- D: (2,3) — no food there.\n- R: (3,4) — no food there.\n\nNo immediate food to eat in one move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is a special rule where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,4). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nHead is at (2,4), tail at (1,4). They are adjacent (left of head is tail).\n\nIs there food at the tail (1,4)? \n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (1,2), (6,6), (6,5), (1,6) — none at (1,4).\n\nSo, no food at tail, so no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Choosing Between U and D\n\nBoth U and D get us closer to some food, but which is better?\n\n- U: towards (1,6)\n- D: towards (1,2)\n\nBoth foods have the same value (+1) and similar life spans (6 and 10). (1,2) has a shorter life span (6 vs 10), so it might disappear sooner, but both have plenty of turns left (current turn is 4, so (1,2) disappears at turn 10, (1,6) at turn 14).\n\nAnother consideration is the path after the move.\n\nAfter U to (2,5):\n- Next move towards (1,6) would likely be L to (1,5), then D to (1,6). But need to ensure no obstacles.\n\nAfter D to (2,3):\n- Next move towards (1,2) would be L to (1,3), then D to (1,2). \n\nBoth paths seem clear. \n\nLooking at the internal obstacle at (3,2), which is near (1,2), but not directly in the path from (2,3) to (1,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving R to (3,4) doesn't help immediately but could be a safer move if we're avoiding potential future collisions, but since we're trying to maximize score, moving towards food seems better.\n\nBetween U and D, both seem equally good. Maybe choose the one that doesn't box us in.\n\nAfter U to (2,5), future moves could be L to (1,5), then D to (1,6).\n\nAfter D to (2,3), future moves could be L to (1,3), then D to (1,2).\n\nBoth sequences seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving R to (3,4) is safe but doesn't progress towards food immediately. \n\nGiven that, let's choose to move towards the food with the shorter life span first to ensure we don't miss it, which is (1,2) (life span 6 vs (1,6) with 10). \n\nSo, move D to (2,3).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers with D (2,3)\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Tail was at (1,4), which moves to (2,4) (since head was at (2,4) and moves to (2,3), so tail follows to (2,4)).\n- New snake: [(2,3), (2,4)]\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (2,3) is within bounds, not an obstacle.\n  - Body: only body is (2,4), not same as (2,3) — safe.\n- Next possible moves from (2,3), direction D:\n  - Cannot move U (opposite of D), so valid moves: L, R, D.\n  \nSeems safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **D (Down)** seems the most strategic to approach the nearest food at (1,2) while avoiding any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

To reach (1,2):\n     - First move Left to (1,3), then Down to (1,2).\n     - But life_span is 1, so at turn 6 it will disappear. We're at turn 5, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach it in time.\n\n2. **(6, 6)**:\n   - Value: 5\n   - From (2,3), need to go right and up.\n   - Life_span is 1, disappears at turn 6. Cannot reach in time.\n\n3. **(6, 5)**:\n   - Value: 6\n   - Life_span is 1, disappears at turn 6. Cannot reach in time.\n\n4. **(1, 6)**:\n   - Value: 9\n   - Life_span is 9, so it will disappear at turn 14.\n   - From (2,3), path could be Left to (1,3), then Up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n   - Takes 3 turns to reach, so can reach by turn 8.\n   - But need to ensure no collisions along the way.\n\nGiven that all other foods disappear next turn, the only viable food is (1,6). So the plan is to start moving towards (1,6).\n\n### Planning the Path to (1,6)\n\nCurrent head at (2,3), direction Down (D).\n\nNext move options (cannot go Up):\n- Left (L): (1,3)\n- Right (R): (3,3)\n- Down (D): (2,2)\n\nTo reach (1,6), best first move is Left to (1,3).\n\nCheck if Left is safe:\n- New head: (1,3)\n- Tail is at (2,4), will move to (2,3) (old head position), so no collision.\n- No walls or obstacles at (1,3).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food on tail?\n- Current tail is at (2,4).\n- Adjacent to head (2,3): yes, tail is directly above head.\n- Is there positive food at (2,4)?

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn (t₀)**: 6\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake can't go outside these bounds.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 2) — a single wall inside the grid.\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (1, 3)\n   - Body: [(1, 3), (2, 3)] — so the snake is two segments long, with the head at (1,3) and the tail at (2,3).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: L (Left) — meaning the snake was moving left to reach (1,3) from (2,3).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (1, 2): value=4, life_span=1\n   - (6, 6): value=4, life_span=1\n   - (6, 5): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (1, 6): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L): (x-1, y) → (0, 3)\n   - New head position: (0, 3)\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a border wall → collision! This is deadly.\n   - **Result**: Invalid move (death).\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U): (x, y+1) → (1, 4)\n   - New head position: (1, 4)\n   - Check for walls: (1,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (2,3), new head is at (1,4) — no collision.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Is (1,4) a food position? No.\n     - Closest foods:\n       - (1,2) is below, (6,6) and (6,5) are far, (1,6) is above but at y=6.\n   - **Result**: Safe move, but no immediate food gain.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D): (x, y-1) → (1, 2)\n   - New head position: (1, 2)\n   - Check for walls: (1,2) is not a wall (internal obstacle is at (3,2)).\n   - Check for body collision: Body is at (2,3), new head is at (1,2) — no collision.\n   - Check for food:\n     - (1,2) is a food position with value=4, life_span=1.\n     - Can we eat it? \n       - Current tail is at (2,3). After moving head to (1,2), tail moves from (2,3) to (1,3) (since the snake was at [(1,3), (2,3)], now [(1,2), (1,3)]).\n       - The food is at (1,2), which is where the head is moving, so we eat it.\n       - **Tail Reward Danger**: After eating, the snake grows to [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]. Is the head adjacent to the new tail?\n         - New head: (1,2), new tail: (2,3) — adjacent? (1,2) and (2,3) are diagonally adjacent (distance of √2), but in Snake, adjacency is usually up/down/left/right (distance 1). So not directly adjacent.\n         - Wait, let's clarify adjacency: in grid terms, (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2). (2,3) is not in this list, so not adjacent.\n         - Therefore, no tail reward danger.\n   - **Result**: Safe move, eat positive food (+4), snake length increases to 3.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R): (x+1, y) → (2, 3)\n   - New head position: (2, 3)\n   - Check for walls: (2,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: Current body is [(1,3), (2,3)], moving to (2,3) would make head overlap with the current body segment at (2,3).\n     - But in Snake rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward.\n     - Current tail is at (2,3), which will move to (1,3) (since the snake was moving left before).\n     - So new positions: [(2,3), (1,3)] — no overlap, but the head is moving to where the tail was, which is allowed because the tail moves away.\n     - However, is this a reverse move? Current direction is L, moving R is opposite — but the rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n     - So moving Right is opposite to Left, hence invalid.\n   - **Result**: Invalid move (instant reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nFrom the above, valid moves are:\n- Up (U): safe, no food.\n- Down (D): safe, eat +4 food.\n- Left (L): deadly (wall).\n- Right (R): invalid (instant reverse).\n\nBetween U and D, D is better because it allows eating positive food without any danger.\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\n- **Food Life Span**: All foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten. So if we don't eat (1,2) now, it's gone.\n- **Other Foods**: \n  - (6,6), (6,5), (1,6) are too far to reach in one move, so not relevant for immediate action.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Already checked for D — no danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (1,2) with value +4, increasing the snake's length safely.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The closest foods are:\n- (1,6): value=7, but it's at y=6, and we're at y=2; moving towards it would require moving up, which is opposite to current direction (not allowed).\n- (4,4): value=10, but it's at (4,4), and we're at (1,2); moving towards it would require moving right and up over multiple turns.\n- (6,6) and (6,5): both are far to the right and up.\n\nGiven that all foods have a life_span of 1, they will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So, none of the foods will be available next turn unless we eat them now.\n\nBut none of the immediate moves can reach any food this turn. The foods are at:\n- (6,6): distance is |6-1| + |6-2| = 5 + 4 = 9\n- (6,5): distance is 5 + 3 = 8\n- (1,6): distance is 0 + 4 = 4\n- (4,4): distance is 3 + 2 = 5\n\nWe can't reach any in one move, so we can't eat any food this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe also need to check if moving to a cell adjacent to the tail could lead to a collision if we eat positive food next to the tail. Currently, the tail is at (2,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4)\n\nOur possible moves are to (1,1), (0,2) (invalid), (2,2). (2,2) is adjacent to the tail. But since we're not eating any food this turn, and there's no food at (2,2), this isn't a concern right now.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Left is invalid (wall).\n- Moving Down or Right are safe but don't eat food.\n- No food can be eaten this turn.\n- Need to choose between Down or Right.\n\nWhich is better? Let's think about future moves:\n- If we move Down to (1,1), next moves could be Left (invalid), Right (to (2,1)), Down (to (1,0) which is wall).\n- If we move Right to (2,2), next moves could be Down (to (2,1)), Left (to (1,2)), Right (to (3,2)) but (3,2) is an internal obstacle.\n\nMoving Right seems slightly better because from (2,2), we can go Down to (2,1), then possibly Left to (1,1), etc., opening more options. Moving Down to (1,1) limits us more.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest and most strategic move is to move **Right (R)** to (2,2).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move Up (U) to (2, 3)\n- New head position: (2, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper border; (2,3) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Current body segments are at (1,2), (1,3). (2,3) is not part of the body. \n    - After moving, the tail (1,3) will move away, so no collision with the new head position.\n- Check for food:\n  - Is there food at (2,3)? Looking at the food list: no.\n- Next state:\n  - Head: (2,3)\n  - Body: (2,2), (1,2)\n  - Tail was at (1,3), which moves away, so no new segment is added (since no food eaten).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2, 1)\n- New head position: (2, 1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the lower border; (2,1) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Current body segments are at (1,2), (1,3). (2,1) is not part of the body.\n    - After moving, the tail (1,3) moves away, so no collision.\n- Check for food:\n  - Is there food at (2,1)? No.\n- Next state:\n  - Head: (2,1)\n  - Body: (2,2), (1,2)\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Consumption\n\nAll foods will disappear after this turn, so if we can eat any, it's now or never. Let's see if any food is reachable in one move from the current head position (2,2):\n\n1. (6,6): Distance is |6-2| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8. Cannot reach in one move.\n2. (6,5): Distance is |6-2| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7. Cannot reach.\n3. (1,6): Distance is |1-2| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5. Cannot reach.\n4. (4,4): Distance is |4-2| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4. Cannot reach.\n\nNone of the foods are adjacent to the head (2,2), so we cannot eat any food this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe should also check if moving the head adjacent to the tail could lead to a dangerous situation where the tail has positive food that could be eaten in the next move, causing a collision.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,3). Is there positive food at (1,3)? No, the foods are at (6,6), (6,5), (1,6), (4,4). So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince we cannot eat any food this turn and both Up and Down moves are safe without any immediate benefits, we can choose either. However, moving Up might position us better to reach some food in future turns, but with the given information, both are equally valid.\n\nGiven that, and since no food is reachable, and both U and D are safe, I'll choose Up to potentially explore more of the grid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 2) is a wall cell the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (2, 3), body at (2, 2), tail at (1, 2).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (6, 6): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (6, 5): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (1, 6): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (4, 4): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, it cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (2, 4)\n- **New Head Position**: (2, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is the upper wall; 4 < 7, so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: Current body segments are at (2, 2) and (1, 2). (2, 4) is not in these, so no body collision.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (2, 4)? No food listed there.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n- **New Head Position**: (1, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is the left wall; 1 > 0, so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: Current body segments are at (2, 2) and (1, 2). (1, 3) is not in these, so no body collision.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (1, 3)? No food listed there.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3, 3)\n- **New Head Position**: (3, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is the right wall; 3 < 7, so no wall collision.\n  - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 2) is a wall, but we're moving to (3, 3), which is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Current body segments are at (2, 2) and (1, 2). (3, 3) is not in these, so no body collision.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (3, 3)? No food listed there.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to eating food. However, let's look at the food items to see if any are reachable soon or if any are under the snake's body:\n\n1. **(6, 6)**: Far from the snake's current position (2, 3). Not reachable in one move.\n2. **(6, 5)**: Similarly far.\n3. **(1, 6)**: x=1 is the same as the tail's x-coordinate, but y=6 is north. Current head is at (2, 3). To reach (1, 6), need to go left then up multiple times.\n4. **(4, 4)**: Head is at (2, 3). To reach (4, 4), need to go right then up or up then right.\n\nNone of the food is immediately adjacent to the head, so no food can be eaten in the next move. \n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, the priority is to position the snake to reach food in future moves while avoiding dead ends or traps.\n\n- **Move Up (U) to (2, 4)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (2,4): U (to (2,5)), L (to (1,4)), R (to (3,4)).\n  - From (2,5), can reach towards (1,6) which has high-value food (5).\n  \n- **Move Left (L) to (1, 3)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (1,3): U (to (1,4)), L (to (0,3) - but x=0 is a wall), R (to (2,3) - but that's the body segment at t0).\n  - So only U is safe, leading to (1,4).\n  - From (1,4), can go U to (1,5), then U to (1,6) to eat the food.\n\n- **Move Right (R) to (3, 3)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (3,3): U (to (3,4)), L (to (2,3) - body segment), R (to (4,3)).\n  - From (3,4), can go towards (4,4) to eat the food there.\n\nComparing these:\n- Moving Left seems to lead directly towards the high-value food at (1,6) in a few moves.\n- Moving Right leads towards (4,4), which also has high value (8), but is slightly further.\n- Moving Up doesn't immediately lead to food but keeps options open.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's no food under the tail currently (tail is at (1,2), no food there), so no immediate danger from that rule.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving Left sets up a path to the high-value food at (1,6) in a few moves, and it's a safe move now, it seems like a good choice. Moving Right also leads to high-value food but is slightly further. Moving Up is safe but doesn't directly lead to food.\n\nBetween Left and Right, Left seems more direct towards (1,6), which has value 5, compared to (4,4) with value 8 but requires more moves. However, both are good options.\n\nGiven that (1,6) is closer in terms of steps (from (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6)), and the food at (1,6) has a life_span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now, but since we can't reach it in one move, it will disappear by the next turn. Wait, the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 9, life_span=1 means it disappears after turn 9, so it's already too late to eat it. \n\nSimilarly, other foods have life_span=1, so they will disappear after this turn. So none of the current food will be available next turn. \n\nThis changes things: since all food will disappear next turn, and none are reachable this turn, the immediate goal is just to survive and not get stuck.\n\nGiven that, the safest move is to go Up, as it moves away from the walls and keeps more options open for future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options and realizing that all food will disappear after this turn, the best immediate action is to move Up to keep the snake safe and positioned for potential future food spawns.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

However, since the snake is currently moving Up (U), it cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) in the next move. So, the possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U)\n- Current head: (2, 4)\n- New head position: (2, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, so (2,5) is safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,2) is not at (2,5).\n  - Body segments: Snake body is at (2,3) and (2,2), so no collision.\n- Food at new position: Is there food at (2,5)? Checking the food list: No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (1, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is the left wall, so (1,4) is safe (not at x=0).\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,2) is not at (1,4).\n  - Body segments: No body at (1,4).\n- Food at new position: Is there food at (1,4)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (3, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, so (3,4) is safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,2) is not at (3,4).\n  - Body segments: No body at (3,4).\n- Food at new position: Is there food at (3,4)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, we need to consider which move positions the snake better to reach food in subsequent turns. Let's look at the food items:\n\n1. (6,5): value=2, life=1\n   - Distance from head (2,4): |6-2| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Not reachable in one move.\n2. (1,6): value=4, life=1\n   - Distance: |1-2| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Life span 1, disappears after this turn. Not reachable in one move.\n3. (4,4): value=7, life=1\n   - Distance: |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2\n   - Can reach in two moves if we move right first to (3,4), then right again to (4,4).\n   - But life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Not reachable in time.\n4. (4,2): value=10, life=1\n   - Distance: |4-2| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Life span 1, disappears after this turn. Not reachable in one move.\n\nAll food items have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after the current turn. Therefore, none of them can be eaten in the immediate next move. Our priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for potential future food spawns.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly opens up more options for future moves. \n\n- Moving Up (U) to (2,5): \n  - Next possible moves from (2,5): U (to (2,6)), L (to (1,5)), R (to (3,5))\n  - Avoids moving towards walls or obstacles immediately.\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,4):\n  - Next moves: U (to (1,5)), D (to (1,3)), L (to (0,4)) - but x=0 is a wall, so L is invalid.\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,4):\n  - Next moves: U (to (3,5)), D (to (3,3)), R (to (4,4))\n  - Moving towards the center may offer more flexibility.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should avoid moves that might corner the snake. \n\n- Moving Left to (1,4) is closer to the left wall (x=0), which might limit future moves.\n- Moving Right to (3,4) is towards the center, which is generally safer.\n- Moving Up to (2,5) is also safe but doesn't offer immediate advantages over Right.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that all food is out of reach this turn, and moving Right seems to position the snake more centrally for future flexibility, the best immediate action is to move Right.\n\nHowever, let's also consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. \n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,2). The head is at (2,4), so they are not adjacent (distance is 2 in y-direction). So this rule doesn't affect our current decision.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Right (R)** seems the most prudent choice to maintain flexibility and avoid immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move Right (R) to (4, 4)\n- New head position: (4, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right border, so (4,4) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,2) is not (4,4).\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(2,4), (2,3)]. (4,4) is not in this list.\n  - Tail collision: Tail is at (2,3). After moving, the tail will move forward from (2,3) to (2,4) (since the second segment is at (2,4)). So new tail is (2,4), and head is at (4,4) — no collision.\n- Food at (4,4): Yes, there's food with value 6.\n  - Eating this food: length increases by 1, score +6.\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n    - Current tail is at (2,3). Adjacent cells to (2,3) are (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4). Head is at (3,4) — not adjacent to (2,3).\n    - So no danger here.\n- Conclusion: Safe move with high reward (+6).\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3, 5)\n- New head position: (3, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top border, (3,5) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,2) is not (3,5).\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(2,4), (2,3)]. (3,5) is not in this list.\n  - Tail collision: After moving, tail moves to (2,4). Head at (3,5) doesn't collide.\n- Food at (3,5): No food here.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, but no reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3, 3)\n- New head position: (3, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the bottom border, (3,3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,2) is just below (3,3). Is (3,3) an obstacle? No, the obstacle is at (3,2), so (3,3) is clear.\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(2,4), (2,3)]. (3,3) is not in this list.\n  - Tail collision: After moving, tail moves to (2,4). Head at (3,3) doesn't collide.\n- Food at (3,3): No food here.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, but no reward.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Right (R)**: +6 points, safe.\n- **Up (U)**: 0 points, safe.\n- **Down (D)**: 0 points, safe.\n\nClearly, moving Right to eat the food at (4,4) with value 6 is the best immediate action.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that eating the food at (4,4) doesn't cause a Tail Reward Danger:\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so new positions will be:\n  - Head: (4,4)\n  - Body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3) — tail is now at (2,3).\n- Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (4,4), tail at (2,3). Adjacent cells to (2,3) are (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4). (4,4) is not adjacent.\n- Also, the food is at (4,4), not on the tail.

No food there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable in one move and safe to eat.\n\n1. **Food at (1, 6)**:\n   - Value: 3\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Distance from head (4,4):\n     - Δx = 1-4 = -3\n     - Δy = 6-4 = 2\n     - Manhattan distance = |Δx| + |Δy| = 3 + 2 = 5\n   - Cannot reach in one move (max move is 1 cell in any direction).\n\n2. **Food at (4, 2)**:\n   - Value: 8\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Distance from head (4,4):\n     - Δx = 4-4 = 0\n     - Δy = 2-4 = -2\n     - Manhattan distance = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\nSince neither food is reachable in one move, we can't eat any food this turn. Therefore, our priority is to move safely without colliding and possibly position ourselves to eat food in future turns.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- Eating it would cause the head and newly grown tail to collide.\n\nCurrent tail position: (2, 3)\nAdjacent to head (4,4)? Let's see:\n- (2,3) is at distance |4-2| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 from head. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\nSo, no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Future Moves Consideration\n\nSince we can't eat food this turn, let's think about positioning for future food. The food at (4,2) is directly below the head but two cells down. Moving down now could help reach it next turn, but it will disappear after this turn, so it's not useful.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,6) is too far and will disappear.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to just move safely without any immediate benefit, keeping options open for future turns.\n\n### Eliminating Dangerous Moves\n\nAll possible moves (U, D, R) are safe as per above. Left is invalid due to instant reverse rule.\n\n### Choosing the Best Safe Move\n\nAmong U, D, R:\n- Moving Right (R) continues the current direction, which is often a safe default unless there's a reason to turn.\n- Moving Up (U) or Down (D) could be equally safe, but without food to aim for, continuing straight might be preferable to avoid unnecessary turns.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body:\n- After moving Right, the body will be at [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], tail at (2,3) moves away to (2,4).\n- After moving Up, body: [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], tail at (2,3) moves to (2,4).\n- After moving Down, body: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], tail at (2,3) moves to (2,4).\n\nAll seem equally safe. Since no food is reachable, and no immediate danger, continuing Right seems reasonable unless there's a strategic reason to turn.\n\nLooking at the internal obstacle at (3,2), it's not in our immediate path for any move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all moves are safe and no food is immediately accessible, the simplest choice is to continue moving in the current direction, Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 13. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't go beyond these.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5, 4), then (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4). So, the snake is moving right (direction is R), and its body is to its left.\n   - Current direction: R (right).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (1, 6): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (4, 2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6, 1): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 4) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 5)\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 3)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 4) - but this is opposite to current direction (R), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 4)\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5, 5)**:\n   - Check for walls: y=5 is not a border wall, and no internal obstacles at (5,5).\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). (5,5) is not in these.\n   - Food at (5,5)? No food there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (5, 3)**:\n   - Walls: y=3 is not a border, no internal obstacle at (5,3).\n   - Body collision: (5,3) not in body segments.\n   - Food at (5,3)? No.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6, 4)**:\n   - Walls: x=6 is not a border (border is at x=7), no internal obstacle at (6,4).\n   - Body collision: (6,4) not in body segments.\n   - Food at (6,4)? No.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves lead to food. So, we need to think about setting up for future food.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nLet's look at the food positions:\n\n1. (1, 6): value=1, life_span=2\n   - Current turn is 13, so it disappears at turn 15.\n   - Distance from head (5,4): |5-1| + |4-6| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves away. Can't reach in 2 turns (life_span=2), so ignore.\n\n2. (4, 2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - Disappears at turn 20.\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 moves away.\n   - Possible to reach in 3 moves: e.g., D to (5,3), then D to (5,2), then L to (4,2).\n   - But need to ensure no collisions during this path.\n\n3. (6, 1): value=1, life_span=10\n   - Disappears at turn 23.\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 moves away.\n   - Possible to reach in 4 moves: e.g., R to (6,4), then D to (6,3), D to (6,2), D to (6,1).\n   - Need to check path safety.\n\nBetween (4,2) and (6,1), (4,2) is closer (3 moves vs 4), and both have same value. Let's aim for (4,2).\n\n### Planning Path to (4,2)\n\nFrom (5,4):\n1. First move: D to (5,3)\n   - Then direction is D.\n2. Second move: D to (5,2)\n   - Check for obstacles: (3,2) is an obstacle, but (5,2) is clear.\n   - Then direction is D.\n3. Third move: L to (4,2)\n   - Opposite of D is U, so L is allowed.\n   - Check for walls/obstacles: (4,2) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - Body collision: Need to see where body is after two moves.\n\nAfter first move D to (5,3):\n- Snake: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] - tail (2,4) is gone.\n\nAfter second move D to (5,2):\n- Snake: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] - tail (3,4) is gone.\n\nThen L to (4,2):\n- Snake head moves to (4,2), which is food.\n- New snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] - length increases by 1.\n- Need to check if (4,2) is under body before moving: original body is (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). (4,2) is not under body, so can eat directly.\n\nNo tail reward danger here because tail is at (4,4), not adjacent to (4,2).\n\n### Checking Alternative Paths\n\nIs there a faster way to (4,2)? \n\nAlternative first move could be L to (4,4), but that's opposite to current direction R, so not allowed.\n\nOnly other first move is U to (5,5), but that's away from (4,2).\n\nSo, D is the best first move towards (4,2).\n\n### Verifying Other Foods\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check path to (6,1):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n1. R to (6,4)\n2. D to (6,3)\n3. D to (6,2)\n4. D to (6,1)\n\nThis takes 4 moves, and food disappears at turn 23, so can reach by turn 17.\n\nBut (4,2) is reachable by turn 16, and both give +1. So, (4,2) is better as it's closer.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Down (D) to (5,3) to start the path towards (4,2).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- After D to (5,3), next move is D to (5,2). Is (5,2) safe?\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Body after first move is [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)], so (5,2) is clear.\n- Then L to (4,2):\n  - Body will be [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4)], so (4,2) is clear.\n  \nNo immediate risks in this path.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and paths to food, the best immediate action is to move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 14  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (5, 3)\n- Body: [(5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are:\n1. Head at (5, 3)\n2. Next segment at (5, 4)\n3. Then (4, 4)\n4. Tail at (3, 4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn. The direction is important because we cannot reverse the direction immediately (i.e., cannot go Up next if current direction is Down).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1, 6): value = 1, life_span = 1\n2. (4, 2): value = 1, life_span = 6\n3. (6, 1): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 reward, +1 length), and none are negative in this case.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 3) and direction D, the possible next moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2) — but current direction is D, so this is allowed unless it's a reverse (which it's not; reverse would be U)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3)\n\nCannot go Up (U) because that would be the reverse of current direction D.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (5, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (5,2) is not on y=0 (since y=2), and x=5 is not a wall. Also, (3,2) is an obstacle, but (5,2) is not (3,2). So no wall collision.\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). (5,2) is not in these, so no body collision.\n- Food: Is there food at (5,2)? Checking the food positions:\n  - (1,6), (4,2), (6,1) — none at (5,2), so no food to eat here.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, (4,3) is not on x=0. No internal obstacles at (4,3).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). (4,3) is not in these, so no collision.\n- Food: Is there food at (4,3)? No, food is at (1,6), (4,2), (6,1).\n  \nThis move is safe but no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (6,3) is not x=7. No internal obstacles at (6,3).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). (6,3) is not in these, so no collision.\n- Food: Is there food at (6,3)? No, food is at (1,6), (4,2), (6,1).\n  \nThis move is safe but no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nAll three possible moves are safe but don't immediately lead to food. However, let's see if moving in a certain direction can set us up to get food in the next turns.\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. (1,6): life_span = 1 — this will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). It's too far to reach in one move from (5,3), so we can ignore this.\n2. (4,2): life_span = 6 — this will stay for 6 more turns including this one. It's at (4,2).\n3. (6,1): life_span = 9 — this will stay for 9 more turns including this one. It's at (6,1).\n\nLet's see how to reach (4,2) or (6,1):\n\n- To reach (4,2):\n  - Current head at (5,3).\n  - Need to go left to (4,3), then down to (4,2).\n  - So first move would be L to (4,3), then D to (4,2).\n  \n- To reach (6,1):\n  - Current head at (5,3).\n  - Need to go right to (6,3), then down twice to (6,1).\n  - So first move would be R to (6,3), then D to (6,2), then D to (6,1).\n\nBetween these, (4,2) is closer (can reach in 2 moves), while (6,1) takes 3 moves. Also, (4,2) has life_span = 6, which is enough for 2 moves (current and next), while (6,1) has life_span = 9, which is more than enough.\n\nBut since both foods are positive and we can't get any this turn, let's choose the move that sets us up for the closest food next turn.\n\n### Choosing Between L and R\n\nOption 1: Move L to (4,3), then next turn can move D to (4,2) to eat the food at (4,2).\n- After eating at (4,2), snake grows by 1, new tail will be where the current tail is moving from (3,4) to (4,4) (since the body moves forward).\n\nOption 2: Move R to (6,3), then next move D to (6,2), then D to (6,1) to eat the food at (6,1).\n- This takes longer, but food at (6,1) has longer life_span.\n\nGiven that (4,2) is closer and has enough life_span, it's better to aim for that first.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nLet's see:\nCurrent tail is at (3,4). Adjacent cells to tail are:\n- (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5)\nOur head is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to (3,4) (distance is more than 1 in both x and y), so no danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Left (L) to (4,3), setting up to move Down next turn to (4,2) to eat the food there.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 2). This is a single cell that's blocked.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (4, 3), followed by body segments at (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4). So, the snake's body forms a sort of \"L\" shape.\n   - **Current Direction**: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n4. **Food**:\n   - **First Food**: At (4, 2), value = +1, life_span = 6.\n   - **Second Food**: At (6, 1), value = +1, life_span = 8.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next move.\n   - **Allowed Moves**: U, D, L (but need to check if L is possible based on other constraints).\n2. **Wall Collision**: Cannot move into walls or obstacles.\n3. **Body Collision**: Cannot move into any body segment except the tail (since the tail will move forward).\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each allowed move (U, D, L):\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (4, 3) → (4, 4).\n   - Check (4, 4):\n     - Currently occupied by the tail (last segment of the snake).\n     - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - Is there positive food on the tail? The tail is at (4, 4), and food is at (4, 2) and (6, 1), so no.\n     - So, moving into the tail is safe here.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move.\n\n2. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (4, 3) → (4, 2).\n   - Check (4, 2):\n     - Is it a wall? No.\n     - Is it an obstacle? No (internal obstacle is at (3, 2)).\n     - Is it food? Yes, positive food with value +1.\n     - Is it part of the body? No (body segments are at (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)).\n     - So, can eat the food, but need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail is where the old tail was (since the body extends).\n       - The new head is at (4, 2), and the new tail is at (4, 4) (since the old tail was at (4, 4), and the body grows by adding a new segment where the head was).\n       - Are (4, 2) and (4, 4) adjacent? They are two cells apart vertically (distance of 2), not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n       - So, no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe and can eat positive food.\n\n3. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - New head position: (4, 3) → (3, 3).\n   - Check (3, 3):\n     - Is it a wall? No.\n     - Is it an obstacle? No (internal obstacle is at (3, 2)).\n     - Is it food? No (food is at (4,2) and (6,1)).\n     - Is it part of the body? No (body is at (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe, but no food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nNow, let's compare the possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**:\n   - Safe, no food, just moving.\n2. **Down (D)**:\n   - Safe, can eat positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n3. **Left (L)**:\n   - Safe, no food.\n\nBetween these, moving Down (D) is the most beneficial as it allows eating positive food without any risks.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Risks\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure there are no immediate risks after moving Down:\n\n- After moving Down to (4, 2), the new snake positions will be:\n  - Head: (4, 2)\n  - Body: (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4) (since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added where the head was before moving, which is (4, 3)).\n  \nNow, check for collisions in the next possible moves (though we're only deciding for the current turn):\n\n- The new length is 5 (original was 4, ate food so +1).\n- The tail is now at (4, 4), which is not adjacent to the head at (4, 2), so no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\n- **Food Lifespan**:\n  - Food at (4, 2): life_span = 6, current turn is 15, so it disappears at turn 15 + 6 = 21.\n  - Food at (6, 1): life_span = 8, disappears at turn 15 + 8 = 23.\n  - Both foods will persist after this turn, but we're only concerned with the current move.\n\n- **Alternative Paths**:\n  - If we don't eat the food now, it will still be there next turn, but the snake's movement might change, and another food might be more accessible.\n  - However, since the food is directly below and safe to eat, it's optimal to take it now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: Eats positive food, increases score and length safely.\n- **Up (U) and Left (L)**: Safe but no immediate benefit.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So moving to (4, 3) would collide with the body. Not allowed.\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 1) - Check if this is a wall or obstacle.\n  - y=1 is not a border wall (y=0 is). No obstacle at (4, 1). Safe to move here.\n- **Left (L)**: (3, 2) - Check for walls or obstacles.\n  - There's an internal obstacle at (3, 2). Cannot move here.\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 2) - Check for walls or obstacles.\n  - x=5, y=2: Not a wall or obstacle. Also, not occupied by any snake segment in the next state (since the tail is moving from (4,4)). Safe to move here.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Down (D) to (4, 1) or Right (R) to (5, 2).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if either move can lead to eating food:\n\n1. **Move Down to (4, 1)**:\n   - No food at (4, 1). \n   - Closest food is at (6, 1) - two steps to the right from (4, 1).\n   - Not immediately beneficial in terms of eating food this turn.\n\n2. **Move Right to (5, 2)**:\n   - No food at (5, 2).\n   - From (5, 2), the food at (6, 1) is one step right and one step down.\n   - Still not eating food this turn, but positions us closer to (6,1).\n\nHowever, there's food at (4, 3), which is currently under the snake's second segment. To eat this:\n- The body must move away from (4, 3), and then the head must move onto it.\n- Currently, the head is at (4, 2). Moving up to (4, 3) would normally collide, but if the body moves away, it's possible.\n- After this move, the tail is at (4, 4). The next segment is (5,4), then (5,3), then (4,3), then (4,2).\nWait, let's see the snake's body after one move:\n\nCurrent snake: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\nIf we move Down to (4,1):\nNew head: (4,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes first body, etc., tail (5,4) is removed.\nNew snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\nNow, (4,3) is still occupied by the body, so we can't eat it next turn by moving up to (4,3) because the body is still there.\n\nSimilarly, if we move Right to (5,2):\nNew snake: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\nNow, (4,3) is still occupied by the body, so same issue.\n\nHmm, seems like we can't eat the food at (4,3) immediately because the body is always on it until the tail moves past it, which would take several turns.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Currently, tail is at (4,4). Adjacent cells to head (4,2):\n  - (3,2) - obstacle\n  - (5,2) - possible\n  - (4,1) - possible\n  - (4,3) - body\nSo, head is not adjacent to tail (distance is more than 1). So no danger here.\n\n### Choosing Between Down and Right\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of not colliding. Neither allows eating food this turn. \n\nLooking ahead:\n- Moving Down to (4,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (4,1): Left to (3,1) (but x=3,y=1 is not an obstacle), Down to (4,0) (y=0 is wall), Right to (5,1).\n  - (6,1) is two steps right from (4,1).\n  \n- Moving Right to (5,2):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,2): Up to (5,3) (body is at (4,3) and (5,3)), Down to (5,1), Left to (4,2) (previous head), Right to (6,2).\n  - (6,1) is one step right and one step down from (5,2).\n\nMoving Right seems slightly better because it positions us closer to the food at (6,1), which is the only reachable food currently (since (4,3) is under body and not immediately eatable).\n\n### Verifying Immediate Food Eating\n\nIs there any way to eat food this turn?\n- Food at (4,3) is under body. To eat it:\n  - Head must move to (4,3), but body is there unless the body moves away.\n  - Currently, body is at (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4).\n  - After any move, the body will still be at (4,3) unless the tail moves past it, which it hasn't yet.\n  - So cannot eat (4,3) this turn.\n\nFood at (6,1):\n- Distance from (4,2): need to move right twice and down once, or down once and right twice.\n- Cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo no immediate food eating possible this turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Down (D) and Right (R), both are safe, but Right seems slightly better for positioning towards (6,1). \n\nLet me check if moving Right could lead to any immediate danger next turn:\n- New head at (5,2). Adjacent cells:\n  - (5,3) - body\n  - (5,1) - safe\n  - (4,2) - body (previous head)\n  - (6,2) - safe\nSo next turn, possible moves would be Down to (5,1) or Right to (6,2). Both safe.\n\nMoving Down to (4,1):\n- New head at (4,1). Adjacent cells:\n  - (4,0) - wall\n  - (4,2) - body\n  - (3,1) - safe\n  - (5,1) - safe\nNext turn could move Left to (3,1) or Right to (5,1). Both safe.\n\nBoth options seem equally safe in terms of next moves, but Right is slightly better for approaching (6,1).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move outside these bounds.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 2). The snake can't move here.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] \n     - Head: (5,2)\n     - Body segments: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n     - Tail: (5,4)\n   - Current direction: R (Right, which is +x direction).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,1): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - (4,3): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,2) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n\n- **U (Up)**: (5,3)\n- **D (Down)**: (5,1)\n- **L (Left)**: (4,2)\n- **R (Right)**: (6,2)\n\nBut we can't reverse direction instantly. Current direction is R, so we can't go L (Left) next.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **U (Up) to (5,3)**:\n   - Check if (5,3) is occupied by body or wall.\n     - Snake body: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n     - (5,3) is part of the body (third segment). Moving here would collide with body → deadly.\n   - **Conclusion**: Can't go U.\n\n2. **D (Down) to (5,1)**:\n   - Check (5,1):\n     - Walls: y=0 is wall, y=1 is not.\n     - Body: (5,1) is not in snake positions.\n     - Food: No food at (5,1).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n   - **Conclusion**: Can go D, but no food.\n\n3. **R (Right) to (6,2)**:\n   - Check (6,2):\n     - Walls: x=7 is wall, x=6 is not.\n     - Body: (6,2) is not in snake positions.\n     - Food: No food at (6,2).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n   - **Conclusion**: Can go R, but no food.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **(6,1)**: value=6, life=1\n   - Position: (6,1)\n   - Distance from head (5,2):\n     - To reach (6,1) from (5,2):\n       - One move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1) → but life_span is 1, so after this turn, it disappears. Can't reach in time.\n   - **Not reachable** before it disappears.\n\n2. **(4,3)**: value=9, life=1\n   - Position: (4,3)\n   - Currently under snake's body (third segment: (4,3)).\n   - To eat it:\n     - Body must move away from (4,3), then head moves onto it.\n     - Currently, body is at (4,3), next turn:\n       - If we move, tail (5,4) moves forward, so body segments shift.\n       - Current body: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n       - After any move, new body:\n         - New head depends on move, then rest is old head to second-to-last segment.\n         - Tail (5,4) is removed unless we eat food.\n     - To free (4,3), the segment at (4,3) must move.\n       - Currently, (4,3) is preceded by (4,2), then head is (5,2).\n       - To move (4,3), the snake must move in a way that (4,2) moves away, making (4,3) move.\n       - But (4,3) is followed by (5,3), so unless the snake grows, (4,3) will move to where (4,2) was.\n     - It's tricky, but since life_span is 1, even if we could free it next turn, it would disappear.\n   - **Not reachable** before it disappears.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food:\n- Tail is at (5,4).\n- Adjacent to head (5,2)? \n  - (5,2) and (5,4): same x, y differs by 2 → not adjacent (adjacent means x or y differs by 1).\n- So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Available Moves\n\nFrom earlier:\n- U: deadly (body collision)\n- D: safe, no food\n- R: safe, no food\n- L: not allowed (reverse direction)\n\nBoth D and R are safe but don't lead to food. \n\nIs there any food that can be reached next turn if we choose a certain direction now?\n\nLet's see possible future moves:\n\n1. If we go D to (5,1):\n   - Next head: (5,1)\n   - Possible next moves from (5,1), direction D:\n     - Can't go U (reverse), so L, R, D.\n     - L: (4,1) - check walls/body:\n       - Walls: no\n       - Body: new body is [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] - (4,1) not in body → safe\n     - R: (6,1) - but food at (6,1) will be gone (life was 1 at t=17, so at t=18 it's gone)\n     - D: (5,0) - wall (y=0) → can't\n   - So next could go L to (4,1), but no food there.\n\n2. If we go R to (6,2):\n   - Next head: (6,2)\n   - Possible next moves from (6,2), direction R:\n     - Can't go L, so U, D, R.\n     - U: (6,3) - check:\n       - Walls: no\n       - Body: new body is [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] - (6,3) not in body → safe\n     - D: (6,1) - but food at (6,1) is gone by t=18\n     - R: (7,2) - wall (x=7) → can't\n   - So next could go U to (6,3), but no food there.\n\nNeither D nor R leads to food next turn. \n\n### Decision\n\nBoth D and R are safe and equivalent in terms of immediate and next-turn food access (none). \n\nSince no food is reachable in the next move, and both moves are safe, we can choose either. \n\nBut the snake is currently moving R, so continuing R might be slightly better to keep a straight path unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nHowever, looking at the body positions:\n- After R: head to (6,2), body: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] - tail is (5,3)\n- After D: head to (5,1), body: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] - tail is (5,3)\n\nNo immediate difference in future options.\n\nGiven that, and since no food is available, either is fine. \n\nBut let's see if one direction avoids potential future traps better:\n\n- Going R moves towards the right wall (x=7 is at x=6 next), which may limit future moves.\n- Going D moves towards the bottom wall (y=0 is at y=1 next), but more space above.\n\nGiven that, D might open up more space for future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nChoose **D (Down)** to (5,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n- **Current Turn (t₀):** 18\n- **Walls:**\n  - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n  - Internal obstacle: (3, 2)\n- **Snake Positions:**\n  - Head: (5, 1)\n  - Body: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3)]\n  - So the full snake is: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] (length 5)\n- **Snake Head Direction:** D (Down)\n- **Food:**\n  - (6, 1): value = 5, life_span = 1\n  - (4, 3): value = 8, value = 1 (assuming this is a typo and it's value=8, life_span=1)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake and food positions on the grid.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (5,1)\n  - Then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3) (tail)\n  \nDrawing this:\n\n```\n(4,3) - (5,3)\n |\n(4,2) - (5,2)\n        |\n       (5,1) [Head]\n```\n\nFood:\n- (6,1): right next to the head (to the right)\n- (4,3): on the body segment (4,3)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Down (D). Possible moves are U, D, L, R, but:\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately (from D to U is illegal).\nSo possible moves: D, L, R\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **Down (D):** (x, y-1) → (5, 0)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall → collision → deadly\n   - Not a valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L):** (x-1, y) → (4, 1)\n   - Check walls: (4,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3) → (4,1) is not in body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R):** (x+1, y) → (6, 1)\n   - Check walls: (6,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (6,1) is not in body.\n   - Also, (6,1) has food with value 5, life_span 1.\n   - Can we eat this food?\n     - Food is not under the snake's body (it's at (6,1), snake is at (5,1), etc.), so no need to move away first.\n     - So, moving to (6,1) would eat the food.\n     - Check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - Adjacent to tail: tail is at (5,3). Adjacent cells to tail are (4,3), (5,4), (6,3), (5,2). (6,1) is not adjacent to tail.\n       - So no danger from eating this food.\n   - Valid move, and eats positive food (+5).\n\n### Evaluating Food at (4,3)\n\nThere's also food at (4,3), which is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the 4th segment from head: (4,3)).\n\nTo eat this:\n- The body must move away first, then head moves onto it.\n- Currently, head is at (5,1), moving to (4,1) (L) or (6,1) (R).\n  - If we move L to (4,1), next turn the body moves, and (4,3) might still be occupied (since tail is at (5,3), and body moves: (5,2)->(5,1), (4,2)->(5,2), (4,3)->(4,2), (5,3)->(4,3) - wait, no, tail moves away from (5,3), so (4,3) is now free next turn if we move left now.\n   - But the food at (4,3) has life_span 1, so next turn it disappears (current turn is 18, life_span is 1, so disappears at turn 19, which is next turn). So we can't eat it in time.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (6,1) this turn means next turn the food at (4,3) is gone.\n\nSo we cannot eat the food at (4,3).\n\n### Decision Between L and R\n\n- **Left (L):** (4,1)\n  - No food there.\n  - Safe move, but no gain.\n  \n- **Right (R):** (6,1)\n  - Eats food with value +5.\n  - Increases length by 1 (new length 6).\n  - No immediate danger.\n  \nBetween these, moving Right is clearly better as it gives a high reward.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move R\n\nAfter moving R to (6,1):\n- New head: (6,1)\n- New body: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] (but since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so length increases by 1)\nWait, no: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one.\n\nOriginal body before move: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)]\nAfter moving R to (6,1), body becomes [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] (length 6).\n\nCheck for collisions next turn:\nNext head position depends on next move, but currently no immediate collision from this move.\n\n### Is There Any Hidden Danger?\n\nCheck \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- After move R, tail is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: (4,3), (5,4), (6,3), (5,2).\n- Head is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to tail (distance is (6-5) + (3-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 > 1).\n- So no danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to eat the high-value food at (6,1) with no associated risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 19\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is an 8x8 grid (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake can't go beyond these borders.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2). The snake can't move into this cell.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nThe snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n1. Head: (6, 1)\n2. Next segment: (5, 1)\n3. Then: (5, 2)\n4. Then: (4, 2)\n5. Then: (4, 3)\n6. Tail: (5, 3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R). This means the last move was to the right, so the head is at (6,1) coming from (5,1).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (4, 3): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, snake length +1).\n   - It will disappear after this turn (since life_span decreases to 0 next turn).\n2. (3, 1): value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Also positive food (+1 score, snake length +1).\n   - It will also disappear after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,1) moving Right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (6, 2)\n- **Down (D)**: (6, 0)\n- **Left (L)**: (5, 1)\n- **Right (R)**: (7, 1)\n\nBut we have to consider:\n1. **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to the current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. Therefore, cannot move Left (L) next.\n   \n   So, possible moves without instant reverse: U, D, R.\n\n2. **Wall collisions**:\n   - U to (6,2): y=2 is within bounds (0 to 7), x=6 is within bounds, and (6,2) is not a wall.\n   - D to (6,0): y=0 is a border wall, so cannot move here (would collide).\n   - R to (7,1): x=7 is a border wall, so cannot move here (would collide).\n\nSo, from U, D, R:\n- D and R are invalid due to walls.\n- Only U is valid in terms of walls and no instant reverse.\n\nBut let's check if moving Up is safe in terms of body collisions.\n\n**Moving Up (U) to (6,2)**:\nCurrent body segments:\n- (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)\n\nIs (6,2) in the body? Let's see:\n- (5,1): no\n- (5,2): no\n- (4,2): no\n- (4,3): no\n- (5,3): no\n\n(6,2) is not in the body, so safe.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up leads to eating any food.\n\nMoving to (6,2):\n- Is there food at (6,2)? No, food is at (4,3) and (3,1).\nSo, no food eaten by moving Up.\n\nAre there other possible moves? We initially thought only U is possible, but let me double-check if we missed anything.\n\nWait, is Left (L) completely forbidden? The rule says \"no instant reverse\", meaning if the last move was R, then next move cannot be L. But is the last move R?\n\nThe snake's positions are:\n[(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), ...]\nHead is at (6,1), previous was (5,1), so the head moved from (5,1) to (6,1), which is +x, so direction is R.\n\nSo yes, cannot move L.\n\nThus, only U is possible.\n\nBut let me think if there's any other way to eat food.\n\nFood at (4,3):\nCurrently, (4,3) is part of the snake's body (it's the 5th segment from head).\nThe rule says:\n\"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo to eat (4,3), the body must move away from (4,3), and then head must move onto it.\n\nCurrent body at (4,3) is followed by (5,3). So if the tail moves from (5,3), then (4,3) is no longer part of the body, and then head can move onto it.\n\nBut how can the tail move? The tail moves when the snake moves forward without eating. If we don't eat, the tail moves forward.\n\nBut to have the head reach (4,3), it's currently at (6,1), which is quite far. It would take multiple moves to reach (4,3), and the food disappears after this turn (life_span=1, so next turn it's gone).\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,1):\nCurrent head at (6,1), to reach (3,1), need to move left three times, but cannot instant reverse, so cannot move left now. Even if we could, it's too far to reach in one move, and food disappears next turn.\n\nSo cannot eat any food this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the tail that could cause danger if eaten?\n\nTail is at (5,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3)\n\nFood is at (4,3) and (3,1). (4,3) is adjacent to tail.\n\nBut the rule says:\n\"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nCurrently, head is at (6,1), tail at (5,3). Are they adjacent?\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so (6,1) and (5,3): no, they are diagonally apart (delta x=1, delta y=2), not adjacent.\n\nSo this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly possible safe move is Up (U) to (6,2), which doesn't eat any food but avoids collisions and walls.\n\nOther moves:\n- D to (6,0): wall collision.\n- R to (7,1): wall collision.\n- L to (5,1): instant reverse, forbidden.\n\nThus, the only valid action is U.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Yes, it's the 4th segment.\n     - But is it the tail? Tail is (4,3). The segment at (5,2) is not the tail, so this would be a body collision.\n   - Deadly move. Cannot go L.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (6, 2) → (7, 2)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, so (7,2) is a wall.\n   - Deadly move. Cannot go R.\n\nSo, the only safe move is **Up (U)**.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if there's any food we can aim for in the next moves.\n\n1. Food at (4,3):\n   - Currently under the tail (4,3).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away from (4,3), and then the head must move onto (4,3).\n     - Current tail is at (4,3). Next turn, tail will move to where the second-to-last segment is now, which is (4,2).\n     - So, if we can move the head to (4,3) after the tail moves, we can eat it.\n     - But currently, head is at (6,2). To reach (4,3) in future, we'd need a path like: \n       - Now: U to (6,3)\n       - Then L to (5,3)\n       - Then L to (4,3)\n     - But by then, the food's life_span is 1, so next turn it disappears. So cannot eat this food.\n\n2. Food at (3,1):\n   - Life_span = 1, so it disappears after this turn.\n   - Current head at (6,2). Distance is |6-3| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away. Cannot reach in one move.\n   - So cannot eat this food now.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince the only safe move now is U, let's see what that leads to:\n\n- Move U to (6,3).\n- Next turn, snake will be: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)]\n   - Tail was at (4,3), now moves to (4,2).\n   - Food at (4,3) disappears (life_span was 1).\n   - Food at (3,1) disappears.\n   - New food may spawn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any danger from the tail having positive food?\n\n- Current tail is at (4,3) with food value = 6 (positive).\n- Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (6,2), tail at (4,3).\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move at this turn is **Up (U)**.

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to take at Turn 21.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2)].\n     - Head is at (6, 3).\n     - Next segment is (6, 2), then (6, 1), and so on.\n     - Tail is at (4, 2).\n   - Current head direction: Up (U). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous turn.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (4, 3): value = 5, life_span = 1.\n   - Food at (3, 1): value = 8, life_span = 1.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nFrom the current head position (6, 3) and direction U, the possible moves are U, L, R (can't reverse to D immediately).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6, 4)**:\n   - Check if (6, 4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=4 is within 0-7, x=6 is within 0-7.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (3, 2) is the only one, not (6, 4).\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Check all segments except tail (since tail moves).\n       - Current body segments after head: (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2).\n       - (6, 4) is not in these.\n   - Food at (6, 4)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5, 3)**:\n   - Check (5, 3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not in body segments: (5, 3) is not in [(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2)].\n   - Food at (5, 3)? No.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (7, 3)**:\n   - Check (7, 3):\n     - x=7 is a border wall. Cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: U or L.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (4, 3)**:\n   - Value: +5 (positive food).\n   - Life span: 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Current head at (6, 3). To reach (4, 3):\n     - Need to move left twice: first to (5, 3), then to (4, 3).\n     - But can't plan ahead; only decide immediate move.\n     - Moving left now to (5, 3) is a step towards it, but not guaranteed to reach next turn.\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |3-3| = 2.\n\n2. **Food at (3, 1)**:\n   - Value: +8 (positive food).\n   - Life span: 1, will disappear after this turn.\n   - Current head at (6, 3). To reach (3, 1):\n     - Distance: |6-3| + |3-1| = 5.\n     - Too far to reach in one move, and life span is 1, so can't reach it in time.\n   - Not reachable this turn.\n\nGiven that, the food at (4, 3) is the only one that could be targeted, but we can't reach it in one move. However, moving left gets us closer.\n\nBut is moving left towards (4, 3) safe?\n\nAfter moving left to (5, 3):\n- Next turn, if we move left again to (4, 3), we'd eat the food.\n- But check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n  - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move.\n  - Current tail is at (4, 2).\n  - New head at (4, 3), tail at (4, 2).\n  - Are they adjacent? Yes, (4,3) and (4,2) are adjacent vertically.\n  - This would cause a collision next turn when the head moves adjacent to the new tail (since tail doesn't move after eating).\n  - Hence, eating (4, 3) is dangerous due to Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTherefore, moving left is safe this turn, but next turn eating (4, 3) would kill the snake. So, moving left is not beneficial in the long run.\n\n### Alternative Move: Up\n\nMoving up to (6, 4):\n- No immediate reward.\n- But safe.\n- Next turn, we can reassess based on new food spawns.\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving up?\n- Next position (6,4) is safe as checked.\n- No food there to cause issues.\n\nIs moving left better even if not eating the food?\n- Moving left to (5,3) is safe this turn.\n- Next turn, from (5,3), possible moves would be U, D, L (can't reverse to R immediately unless direction changes).\n- But no immediate benefit over moving up.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving towards the high-value food (4,3) leads to danger next turn.\n- The other food is unreachable this turn.\n- Moving up is safe and keeps options open for next turns.\n\n**Best immediate action**: Move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(6,5) is not in this list — safe.\n- Food at (6,5)? No food there.\n- After moving:\n  - Head moves to (6,5), tail moves from (5,2), so new body is [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)].\n  - Length increases by 0 (no food eaten).\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (5, 4)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is within bounds.\n  - Body: (5,4) is not in body segments — safe.\n- Food at (5,4)? No food there.\n- After moving:\n  - Head moves to (5,4), tail moves from (5,2), so new body is [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)].\n  - Length increases by 0 (no food eaten).\n\n### Considering Food\n\nLet's see where the food is and if we can reach any:\n\n1. (4,3): value=1, life=4\n   - Distance from head (6,4): Manhattan distance is |6-4| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - Possible to reach in 3 moves if path is clear.\n2. (3,1): value=1, life=7\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   - Life is 7, so possible but further.\n3. (4,5): value=1, life=10\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - Life is 10, so easily reachable.\n\nCurrently, moving U to (6,5) gets us closer to (4,5), and moving L to (5,4) gets us closer to (4,3).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nWe need to ensure that if we eat positive food, the new tail won't collide with the head. Currently, the tail is at (5,2), and head is at (6,4). They are not adjacent (distance is |6-5| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3), so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and L:\n- Moving U gets us closer to (4,5), which is positive food with long life.\n- Moving L gets us closer to (4,3), but (4,5) is also reachable and has longer life.\n\nGiven that (4,5) is more \"future-proof\" (life=10 vs life=4 for (4,3)), moving U seems better to aim for (4,5).\n\n### Verifying Path to (4,5)\n\nFrom (6,4):\n1. U to (6,5)\n2. Then possible moves from (6,5):\n   - L to (5,5)\n   - U to (6,6) — but y=6 is not a wall, but then next move would be towards (4,5).\nFrom (6,5), moving L to (5,5) then L to (4,5) seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,4), L to (5,4), then L to (4,4), then U to (4,5) — also possible, but takes same number of steps (3) as the U-first path.\n\nGiven that both paths are equal in steps, but moving U first aligns with current direction (no need to turn immediately), and (4,5) has longer life, U seems better.\n\n### Final Check for Immediate Dangers\n\nMoving U to (6,5):\n- Not a wall.\n- Not a body segment.\n- No food there, so no immediate reward or penalty.\n- Sets up path towards (4,5).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 23\n\n**Walls:**\n- **Border Cells:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake can't go outside these bounds.\n- **Internal Obstacles:** [(3, 2)]. So, the cell (3,2) is blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (6, 5)\n- Body segments in order: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n  \nSo, the snake is currently moving upwards (head at (6,5), next segment at (6,4)), and its tail is at (5,1).\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** U (Up)\n\n**Food Items:**\n1. (4, 3): value = 3, life_span = 1\n2. (3, 1): value = 6, life_span = 1\n3. (4, 5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\nWait a minute, the format seems a bit off. The food is given as (x, y, life_span, value), not (x, y, value, life_span). So correcting that:\n\n1. (4, 3): life_span = 3, value = 1\n2. (3, 1): life_span = 6, value = 1\n3. (4, 5): life_span = 9, value = 1\n\nAll food items have a value of +1, so they're all positive foods.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, it cannot instantly reverse to Down (rule: no instant reverse). So possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U)\n- Current head: (6,5)\n- New head position: (6,6)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, so (6,6) is within bounds.\n- Body segments: Snake's body is at [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]. (6,6) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n  \nCheck for food:\n- Food at (4,5), (3,1), (4,3). (6,6) has no food.\n  \nSo, moving Up is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (6,5)\n- New head position: (5,5)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=0 is left wall, (5,5) is within bounds.\n- Internal obstacle: (3,2) is not (5,5).\n- Body segments: (5,1) is part of the tail, but the tail will move forward when the head moves, so the current tail at (5,1) will be gone after the move. The new tail will be where the second-to-last segment was, which is (6,1). So no collision with body.\n  \nCheck for food:\n- (4,5) is one cell to the left and up from (5,5). Not directly on (5,5).\n- (3,1) and (4,3) are not at (5,5).\n  \nSo, moving Left is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- Current head: (6,5)\n- New head position: (7,5)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=7 is the right wall, so (7,5) is a wall. This would cause a wall collision.\n  \nSo, moving Right is not safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nCurrently, none of the possible safe moves (U, L) lead directly to food. But let's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we can aim for in future moves.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (6,5):\n- Up: (6,6) - no food\n- Down: (6,4) - body segment, can't go Down (reverse)\n- Left: (5,5) - no food\n- Right: (7,5) - wall\n\nSo, no immediate food to eat. \n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their life spans:\n1. (4,3): life_span = 3, value = 1\n   - Current turn is 23, so it will disappear at turn 26.\n2. (3,1): life_span = 6, value = 1\n   - Disappears at turn 29.\n3. (4,5): life_span = 9, value = 1\n   - Disappears at turn 32.\n\nAll foods have the same value (+1), so we can prioritize based on proximity or life span.\n\n**Food at (4,5):** Closest to the head (distance of 2: left twice or up then left).\n**Food at (4,3):** Further down.\n**Food at (3,1):** Even further down and left.\n\nGiven that (4,5) is the closest and has a life span of 9, we can aim to reach it.\n\n### Planning a Path to (4,5)\n\nFrom head at (6,5) to (4,5):\n- Need to move left twice: L then L.\nBut current direction is U, so first move can be L.\n\nAfter first move L:\n- New head: (5,5)\n- Snake body: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] (tail (5,1) is gone)\n  \nNext move would be L again:\n- New head: (4,5) - which is the food.\n  \nBut we need to check if eating this food is safe. After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move. The new tail would be the last segment before the old tail, which is (6,1). \n\nNow, is there any \"Tail Reward Danger\"? That is, is the head adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food?\n\nAfter moving to (4,5):\n- Head: (4,5)\n- Tail: (6,1)\n  \nIs (6,1) adjacent to (4,5)? Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n- x difference: 4 vs 6 (diff 2)\n- y difference: 5 vs 1 (diff 4)\nNot adjacent, so no danger.\n\nAlso, is there food at the tail (6,1)? No, food is at (4,3), (3,1), (4,5). So no food at tail.\n\nThus, eating (4,5) is safe.\n\n### Verifying Immediate Action\n\nGiven that, the immediate action should be to start moving towards (4,5), which is Left (L).\n\nAfter L:\n- Head at (5,5)\n- Next turn, can move L again to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nIs there any risk in moving L now?\n- Moving to (5,5): not a wall, not a body segment (since tail moves from (5,1) to (6,1)), no food there to cause any issues.\n  \nAlternative is moving U, but that doesn't help in getting food soon.\n\n### Checking Other Possibilities\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that we can eat?\n\nCurrent snake body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\nFood positions: (4,3), (3,1), (4,5)\nNone of these are under the snake's body, so no.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to start heading towards the food at (4,5), which is the closest positive food with a reasonable life span.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 24  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2) — can't move here.\n\n**Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (5, 5)\n- Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)]\n  \nSo, the snake is moving left (L) from (5,5), with its body extending to the right and then down.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (4, 3) — value: 1, life span: 2\n2. (3, 1) — value: 1, life span: 5\n3. (4, 5) — value: 1, life span: 8\n\nAll foods are positive (+1), none are negative.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Left (L). From the rules, we cannot do an instant reverse, so we cannot move Right (R) next. So possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or continue Left (L).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Continue Left (L) — to (4,5)\n- New head position: (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,5) is within borders, not an internal wall.\n  - Body: Snake body is at [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]. (4,5) is not in this list — safe.\n- Food at (4,5): Yes, there's food here with value +1.\n  - Eating this food: length increases by 1, score +1.\n  - Check Tail Reward Danger: After eating, the new tail will be where the current tail is (6,1), but the head is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (6,1) — safe.\n  \nSo moving Left is safe and gets us +1.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) — to (5,6)\n- New head position: (5,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a wall, but (5,6) is y=6 — safe.\n  - Body: (5,6) is not in the body list — safe.\n- Food at (5,6): No food listed here — no gain.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't gain us anything.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) — to (5,4)\n- New head position: (5,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (5,4) is y=4 — safe.\n  - Body: (5,4) is not in the body list — safe.\n- Food at (5,4): No food listed here — no gain.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't gain us anything.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Left (L): +1 score, safe.\n- Up (U): no gain, safe.\n- Down (D): no gain, safe.\n\nClearly, moving Left is the best option here as it gains us a point without any risk.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that eating the food at (4,5) doesn't cause a collision next turn:\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new body will be [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)].\n- Next turn, if we move from (4,5), the tail will move from (6,1) to (6,2), so the new tail is (6,2).\n- The head at (4,5) is not adjacent to (6,2) — they are at a distance of |4-6| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5, which is more than 1. So no danger.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- The food at (4,3) has a life span of 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 25 (current is 24). But it's not reachable in one move from (5,5).\n- Similarly, other foods are not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to eat the positive food at (4,5), increasing the score by 1 without any risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

From the head at (4,5), possible moves are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (3,5)\n   - Check if this is valid:\n     - Not opposite to current direction (no instant reverse rule).\n     - Not a wall: (3,5) is not listed as a wall (border is x=0,7; y=0,7; internal obstacle is (3,2)).\n     - Not colliding with body: Check if (3,5) is in snake body.\n       - Snake body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) — (3,5) is not here.\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (4,6)\n   - Check:\n     - Not opposite to current left direction (opposite would be right).\n     - Not a wall: y=7 is a wall, but y=6 is not.\n     - Not colliding with body: (4,6) is not in body.\n     - Valid move.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (4,4)\n   - Check:\n     - Not opposite to current left direction.\n     - Not a wall: y=0 is wall, y=4 is not.\n     - Not colliding with body: (4,4) is not in body.\n     - Valid move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,5)\n   - Check:\n     - Opposite to current left direction — cannot do this (no instant reverse).\n     - Invalid move.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves: Left (L), Up (U), Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nLet's see where the food is and if we can reach any this turn:\n\n1. (4,3): value=1, life=1\n   - Current head at (4,5). To reach (4,3), need to move down twice, but only one move per turn.\n   - Cannot reach this turn.\n\n2. (3,1): value=4, life=1\n   - From (4,5), need to go left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then (3,3), then (3,2) — but (3,2) is an obstacle.\n   - Cannot reach this turn.\n\n3. (2,1): value=10, life=1\n   - From (4,5), path would be left to (3,5), then (2,5), then (2,4), etc.\n   - Cannot reach this turn.\n\nNone of the food can be eaten this turn because they're all more than one move away. So, the primary goal is to avoid dying and position ourselves to possibly get food next turns.\n\n### Avoiding Collisions and Planning Ahead\n\nCurrent head at (4,5), moving left (L). Let's see where each move takes us:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,5):\n     - Left: (2,5) — valid.\n     - Up: (3,6) — valid.\n     - Down: (3,4) — valid.\n   - No immediate collision risks.\n   - Moves us towards the left side where higher value food is (though not reachable this turn).\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,6):\n     - Left: (3,6) — valid.\n     - Up: (4,7) — y=7 is wall, invalid.\n     - Right: (5,6) — valid (but need to check body).\n       - Body after move: head at (4,6), body starts at (4,5), then (5,5), etc.\n       - (5,6) is not in body, so valid.\n   - Moves towards top, but not much benefit seen.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,4):\n     - Left: (3,4) — valid.\n     - Down: (4,3) — valid.\n     - Right: (5,4) — valid.\n   - Moves towards (4,3) food which is value=1, but it disappears after this turn, so next turn it's gone.\n   - Not much benefit.\n\nBetween these, moving Left seems the most promising as it moves towards the higher value foods on the left side, even if not immediately reachable.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nTail is at (6,1). Is any food on the tail?\n- Food positions: (4,3), (3,1), (2,1).\n- Tail is at (6,1), no food there.\n- So no danger of eating food on tail this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- No food can be eaten this turn.\n- Moving Left is safe and positions us better for future moves towards higher value foods.\n- Up and Down don't offer immediate benefits and Left seems strategically better.\n\n**Action**: Continue moving Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (3, 2). So, the snake cannot move to (3, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. \n     - Head is at (3,5).\n     - Tail is at (6,2).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L).

However:\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the last move was Left, the snake cannot move Right (opposite direction) in the next turn. So, R is invalid.\n  \nThus, valid moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U): (x, y+1) → (3,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Wall**: y=6 is not a border (border is y=7), so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: Check if (3,6) is in the snake's body positions.\n    - Current body: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)].\n    - (3,6) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- **Food**: Is there food at (3,6)? No, the food is at (3,1) and (2,1).\n- **Outcome**: Just move without eating.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D): (x, y-1) → (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Wall**: y=4 is not a border (border is y=0), so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: Is (3,4) in the body?\n    - Not in the list, so no collision.\n- **Food**: No food at (3,4).\n- **Outcome**: Just move without eating.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L): (x-1, y) → (2,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Wall**: x=2 is not a border (border is x=0), so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: Is (2,5) in the body?\n    - Not in the list, so no collision.\n- **Food**: No food at (2,5).\n- **Outcome**: Just move without eating.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nCurrently, the food is at:\n1. (3,1): value = +1, life_span = 4.\n   - Distance from head (3,5): vertical distance is 4 (from y=5 to y=1).\n   - To reach it, the snake would need to move down 4 times: D, D, D, D.\n   - But after first D to (3,4), the next D to (3,3), then (3,2) is an obstacle, so cannot reach (3,1) directly.\n   - So, cannot reach (3,1) in a straight path due to obstacle at (3,2).\n   \n2. (2,1): value = +1, life_span = 9.\n   - Distance from head (3,5): x=2 (left by 1), y=1 (down by 4).\n   - To reach it, one possible path: L to (2,5), then D, D, D, D to (2,1).\n     - But need to ensure no collisions along the way.\n     - After L to (2,5), body would be [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), ..., (6,2)].\n     - Then D to (2,4): check if (2,4) is in body: no.\n     - Then D to (2,3): no.\n     - Then D to (2,2): no.\n     - Then D to (2,1): no.\n     - But need to ensure that after eating at (2,1), the new tail (which was at (6,2)) doesn't cause a collision.\n       - After eating, length increases by 1, so tail stays at (6,2) (since the last segment was (6,2) and now it's not removed).\n       - Head is at (2,1), tail at (6,2): no adjacency, so safe.\n   - However, this is a multi-step plan, and we're only deciding the immediate action.\n\n### Immediate Action Considerations\n\nGiven that we're deciding only the immediate action at t=26, and there's no immediate food to eat in the next move (since both foods are at y=1 and we're at y=5), the primary goal is to avoid collisions and position the snake to potentially reach food in the future.\n\nLooking at the current valid moves (U, D, L):\n\n- **U to (3,6)**:\n  - Moves towards the top, but no food there.\n  - Not near any walls or body.\n  \n- **D to (3,4)**:\n  - Moves down, closer to the food at y=1.\n  - Not near any walls or body.\n  \n- **L to (2,5)**:\n  - Moves left, which is towards the food at (2,1) in the x direction.\n  - Not near any walls or body.\n\nBetween D and L, both move towards the food in some way. L moves directly towards (2,1) in the x-axis, while D moves towards it in the y-axis. \n\nGiven that the food at (2,1) has a longer life_span (9) compared to (3,1) which is 4, it's better to aim for (2,1). Moving L now starts the path towards it.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n- Tail is at (6,2).\n- Head is at (3,5).\n- Distance: |3-6|=3, |5-2|=3, so not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1 in one axis and same in other).\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to start heading towards the food at (2,1), which is safe and doesn't lead to any immediate collisions.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - So, possible moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**:\n   - Moving Left (L) from (2,5): (1,5) - not a wall.\n   - Moving Up (U) from (2,5): (2,6) - y=7 is wall, y=6 is not.\n   - Moving Down (D) from (2,5): (2,4) - y=0 is wall, y=4 is not.\n   \n   All three possible moves don't directly hit walls.\n\n3. **Body Collisions**:\n   - Current body segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n   - Moving Left (L) to (1,5): Not occupied by body.\n   - Moving Up (U) to (2,6): Not occupied by body.\n   - Moving Down (D) to (2,4): Not occupied by body.\n   \n   No immediate body collisions from these moves.\n\n4. **Food Considerations**:\n   - Food at (3,1) and (2,1), both with value +1.\n   - To eat food, the head must move onto the food cell.\n   - Current head at (2,5), food at (3,1) and (2,1).\n     - Distance to (3,1): |2-3| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n     - Distance to (2,1): |2-2| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4\n   - Neither is immediately adjacent, so no food can be eaten in the next move.\n\n5. **Tail Reward Danger**:\n   - Tail is at (6,3).\n   - Adjacent cells to tail: (5,3), (7,3), (6,2), (6,4).\n   - Head is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to tail (distance is |2-6| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6).\n   - No immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven the above, let's evaluate each possible move (U, D, L):\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n   - Moves away from the body and current path.\n   - No immediate food benefit.\n   - Keeps options open for future moves.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n   - Moves towards the top border (y=7 is wall at y=7).\n   - Currently at y=5, moving to y=6.\n   - No immediate benefit or risk.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (2,4)**:\n   - Moves towards the bottom border (y=0 is wall at y=0).\n   - Currently at y=5, moving to y=4.\n   - No immediate benefit or risk.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince none of the moves lead directly to food, and all are safe in terms of walls and body collisions, we should choose a move that positions the snake for future food collection or avoids trapping itself.\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,5) takes the snake towards the left border (x=0), which may limit future options.\n- Moving Up (U) or Down (D) keeps the snake in the middle, allowing more flexibility.\n\nBetween Up and Down:\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (2,6): The food at (2,1) is below; moving up may make it harder to reach soon.\n- Moving Down (D) to (2,4): Moves closer to the food at (2,1) (from y=5 to y=4), reducing the y-distance from 4 to 3.\n\nThus, moving Down seems slightly better as it reduces the distance to one of the food items.\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement\n\nAfter moving, the tail will move forward from (6,3) to (6,4) [assuming the body follows the head's path]. This doesn't affect our current move's safety.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest and most strategic move is **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 28.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: (3, 2) is a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)]\n   - Current direction: Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3, 1): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (2, 1): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (1, 5): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position on the grid:\n\n- Head at (2, 4), moving Down (D), which means it was at (2, 5) before moving to (2, 4).\n- Body segments follow: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).\n\nFood positions:\n- (3,1)\n- (2,1)\n- (1,5)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,4) moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- Left (L): (1,4)\n- Right (R): (3,4)\n- Down (D): (2,3) - but current direction is D, so can't reverse to Up (U).\n\nBut we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is D, we cannot move U next.\n- So possible moves: L, R, D.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L): (1,4)\n- Check if (1,4) is a wall: No (walls are x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,2)).\n- Check if (1,4) is part of the snake's body:\n  - Snake body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n  - (1,4) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (1,5): Not directly reachable in this move, but moving left could be a step towards it.\n- No immediate food at (1,4).\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R): (3,4)\n- Check if (3,4) is a wall: No.\n- Check if (3,4) is part of the snake's body: No.\n- Food at (3,1): Not directly reachable here.\n- No immediate food at (3,4).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D): (2,3)\n- Check if (2,3) is a wall: No.\n- Check if (2,3) is part of the snake's body: No.\n- Food at (2,1): Not directly reachable here.\n- No immediate food at (2,3).\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their life spans:\n\n1. (3,1): life_span=2 (will disappear after 2 more turns, including this one).\n2. (2,1): life_span=7.\n3. (1,5): life_span=10.\n\nThe food at (3,1) is about to disappear soon. It's at (3,1), and our head is at (2,4). To reach (3,1):\n- Need to go right to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), but (3,2) is a wall, so can't go there.\n- Alternative path: down to (2,3), then right to (3,3), then down to (3,2) - but again, (3,2) is wall.\nSo, cannot reach (3,1) before it disappears.\n\nFood at (2,1):\n- From (2,4), down to (2,3), then (2,2), then (2,1).\n- Possible, but takes 3 moves, and life_span is 7, so plenty of time.\n\nFood at (1,5):\n- From (2,4), left to (1,4), then up to (1,5).\n- Takes 2 moves, life_span is 10, so enough time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if moving to any position could lead to the head being adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail cell, which would kill the snake if eaten next.\n\nCurrent tail is at (6,4). Adjacent to tail means positions (5,4), (7,4), (6,3), (6,5).\n\nOur possible moves are to (1,4), (3,4), (2,3). None of these are adjacent to the tail (6,4), so no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving left to (1,4) is safe and is a step towards food at (1,5).\n- Moving right to (3,4) is safe but doesn't lead directly to food.\n- Moving down to (2,3) is safe and is a step towards food at (2,1), but (1,5) is also an option.\n\nBetween (1,5) and (2,1), both have the same value, but (1,5) is closer (2 moves away vs 3 moves for (2,1)). Also, (1,5) has a longer life span, but both are sufficient.\n\nChoosing to go towards (1,5) seems slightly better because it's closer.\n\n### Verifying Immediate Food Under Snake\n\nCheck if any food is under the snake's body that could be eaten if the body moves away:\n- Food positions: (3,1), (2,1), (1,5)\n- Snake body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n- No food is under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate move is **Left (L)** to (1,4), as it's safe and progresses towards the food at (1,5).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 30.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (3, 2). The snake cannot move here.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n     - Head: (1, 5)\n     - Body: (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5)\n   - **Length**: 8 segments.\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is facing \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There's one piece of food at (2, 1) with:\n     - Value: +1 (positive food)\n     - Life Span: 6 turns remaining (including the current turn)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (1, 5) facing \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (1, 6)\n- **Down (D)**: (1, 4) — but this is the immediate body segment; moving here would collide with the body.\n- **Left (L)**: (0, 5) — x=0 is a wall; cannot move here.\n- **Right (R)**: (2, 5) — this is part of the body (third segment). However, since the tail is at (6, 5), moving right would have the head at (2, 5) and the tail would move forward from (6, 5) to (5, 5), so (2, 5) would no longer be occupied by the body after the move. But let's check the body segments after the move to ensure no collision.\n\nWait, let's clarify the body segments after a move:\n\nCurrent body: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n\nIf we move Right to (2,5):\n- New head: (2,5)\n- Body becomes: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n   - Wait, the tail was (6,5), which moves to (5,5), but (2,5) is already in the new body (third segment is (2,4), next is (2,5), so the head would be at (2,5) which is also the fourth segment in the new body — that's a collision!\n\nSo moving Right would cause the head to collide with the body at (2,5) after the move. Hence, Right is not safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving Down to (1,4) is the immediate body segment — collision.\n\nMoving Left to (0,5) is a wall — invalid.\n\nMoving Up to (1,6):\n- Check if (1,6) is within bounds: y=6 is valid (since y=7 is wall), x=1 is valid.\n- Is (1,6) occupied by body? Current body positions:\n  - (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n  - (1,6) is not in this list — safe.\n- No food at (1,6) — just moving without eating.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nThe only food is at (2,1):\n- Current head: (1,5)\n- To reach (2,1), we'd need to move down multiple times, but currently, moving down is not possible (collision with body).\n- The food is at (2,1) with life span 6, meaning it will disappear after Turn 35 (since current is 30, and countdown decreases each turn including current).\n\nGiven that, we cannot reach the food immediately, and our immediate concern is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nFrom the above, the only safe move is **Up (U)** to (1,6).\n\nOther moves:\n- Down (D): (1,4) — body collision.\n- Left (L): (0,5) — wall.\n- Right (R): (2,5) — would collide with body after move.\n\n### Verifying Reverse Move Constraint\n\nCurrent direction is \"U\" (Up). The opposite is \"D\" (Down). \n- Rule: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n- So, Down is invalid not just because of collision but also because it's the reverse direction.\n\nThus, possible non-reverse moves are Up, Left, Right.\n- Left: wall.\n- Right: body collision.\n- Up: safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and legal move is **Up (U)**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n     - Head: (1, 6)\n     - Body: (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the next move would increase the y-coordinate by 1.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - **First Food**: At (2, 1) with a value of +1 and a life span of 5 turns.\n   - **Second Food**: At (1, 3) with a value of +1 and a life span of 10 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- The snake's head is at (1, 6).

But let's double-check:\n\n- **Current Direction**: Right (R). \n  - Opposite direction is Left (L), which is invalid both because it's opposite and because (1, 6) is occupied.\n  - So possible non-opposite directions are U, D, R.\n\nFrom (2, 6):\n- U: (2,7) → wall → invalid\n- D: (2,5) → body segment → collision → invalid\n- R: (3,6) → free → valid\n\nSo, the only possible move is Right (R). \n\nBut let's check if there's any food at (3,6) that we might be missing. The food positions are at (2,1) and (1,3), neither is at (3,6), so moving Right doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Checking for Food Under the Snake\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- (2,6): head\n- (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5): body\nFood is at (2,1) and (1,3). Neither is under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food. Eating it would kill the snake because the head and newly grown tail would collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,5). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5)\nHead is at (2,6), which is not adjacent to (4,5) (distance is |2-4| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3), so no danger here.\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nGiven that the only valid move is Right (R), and there's no food to eat or immediate danger, the action is straightforward.\n\nHowever, let's think if there's any other possible interpretation where another move might be valid. Maybe the snake can move into the tail's position if the tail is about to move.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,5). Next segment is at (3,5). If the snake moves Right to (3,6), the tail will move from (4,5) to (3,5), so no overlap.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the tail is at (4,5), and the segment before it is at (3,5), then the tail will move to (3,5) next turn, freeing (4,5). But currently, the head is at (2,6), so moving to (3,6) is the only option.\n\n### Verifying No Other Moves\n\nIs there any way to move Down to (2,5)? \n\n(2,5) is occupied by the snake's body (6th segment). Unless it's the tail, moving into it is a collision. The tail is at (4,5), so (2,5) is not the tail → collision → invalid.\n\nSimilarly, Left to (1,6) is occupied by the body (2nd segment) → collision → invalid.\n\nUp to (2,7) is a wall → invalid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move is to continue moving Right to (3,6).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 33 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n  - Head is at (3, 6).\n  - Tail is at (3, 5).\n- Current direction: Right (R). This means the last move was to the right, so the snake was previously at (2, 6) and moved right to (3, 6).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Two food items:\n  1. (2, 1): value = 1, life_span = 3\n  2. (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 6), and given the last move was Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- Up (U): (3, 7) → but y=7 is a wall → invalid (collision)\n- Down (D): (3, 5)\n- Left (L): (2, 6) → opposite of current direction (R) → invalid (no instant reverse)\n- Right (R): (4, 6)\n\nSo, the valid moves are Down (D) and Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Down (D) to (3, 5)\n\n- New head position: (3, 5)\n- Current tail is at (3, 5), but the tail will move forward when the head moves, so the new tail will be at (2, 5).\n- Check if (3, 5) is part of the snake's body before the tail moves:\n  - Current body segments after head: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)\n  - (3,5) is the current tail. Moving here is generally safe because the tail moves away, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Is there positive food at the tail's current position (3,5)? \n      - Food is at (2,1) and (1,3), not at (3,5) → no danger.\n- Also, check if (3,5) is a wall: no.\n- Is there food at (3,5)? No.\n- So, moving Down is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Right (R) to (4, 6)\n\n- New head position: (4, 6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but 4 < 7 → not a wall.\n  - Body segments: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) → (4,6) not in this list → safe.\n- Is there food at (4,6)? No.\n- So, moving Right is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Comparing D and R\n\nBoth moves are safe, but neither directly eats food. However, let's think about future possibilities:\n\n- Moving Down (D) to (3,5):\n  - Next moves from (3,5): \n    - Current direction would be D, so can't move U (reverse).\n    - Possible: L (2,5), R (4,5), D (3,4)\n    - (2,5) is in body (current segment), but tail is moving from (3,5) to (2,5), so (2,5) will be free unless the body is there.\n    - Current body after head moves D: (3,6) moves to (3,5), tail (3,5) moves away, so body is [(3,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5)]\n    - So (2,5) is in body → can't move L to (2,5).\n    - R to (4,5): safe, no body or wall.\n    - D to (3,4): safe, no body or wall.\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,6):\n  - Next moves from (4,6):\n    - Current direction R, can't move L.\n    - Possible: U (4,7) → wall, D (4,5), R (5,6)\n    - D to (4,5): safe.\n    - R to (5,6): safe.\n\nBoth initial moves lead to safe positions, but neither gets food immediately. \n\nLooking at the food:\n- (2,1): life_span=3, current turn=33, so disappears at turn=36.\n- (1,3): life_span=8, disappears at turn=41.\n\nThe snake is currently at the top (y=6), and food is at lower y (1 and 3). To reach food, we need to move downward over time.\n\nMoving Down (D) now gets us closer to the food at (1,3) and (2,1), whereas moving Right (R) keeps us at the same y-level.\n\nBetween the two, moving Down seems better for eventually reaching food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Opportunities\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately by moving in a certain direction? \n\n- Food at (2,1) and (1,3) are not adjacent to the head (3,6), so no immediate eating possible.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail's position?\n- Head at (3,6), tail at (3,5): adjacent (directly below).\n- Is there food at (3,5)? No.\n- So, no danger in moving Down.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Down and Right are safe moves, but Down moves the snake closer to the food positions. Right doesn't provide any immediate benefit and keeps the snake at the same y-level, making it harder to reach food in the future.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move to these coordinates.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 2). The snake can't move here.\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head at (3, 5), followed by body segments in order: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5).\n   - So, the tail is at (2,5).\n4. **Current Direction**: The head is moving Down (\"D\"), meaning it's moving in the negative y-direction.\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (2, 1): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (1, 3): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (4, 1): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5) moving Down (\"D\"), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (\"L\")**: (x-1,y) → (2,5)\n- **Right (\"R\")**: (x+1,y) → (4,5)\n- **Down (\"D\")**: (x,y-1) → (3,4)\n  \nCannot move Up (\"U\") because that would be the opposite of the current direction (\"D\"), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (\"L\") to (2,5)\n- Check if (2,5) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Snake body segments: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5)\n  - (2,5) is the tail. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - If the tail has positive food and the head is adjacent to the tail, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n    - Is there food at the tail (2,5)? Looking at the food positions: (2,1), (1,3), (4,1) — no food at (2,5).\n    - So, no danger from tail reward.\n- Is (2,5) a wall? No, walls are at borders and (3,2).\n- Conclusion: Safe to move left to (2,5).\n\n#### 2. Move Right (\"R\") to (4,5)\n- Check if (4,5) is occupied by snake's body:\n  - Not in the body segments list.\n- Is (4,5) a wall? No.\n- Conclusion: Safe to move right to (4,5).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (\"D\") to (3,4)\n- Check if (3,4) is occupied by snake's body:\n  - Not in the body segments list.\n- Is (3,4) a wall? No.\n- Conclusion: Safe to move down to (3,4).\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see if any of these moves can lead us toward food:\n\n1. **Food at (2,1)**:\n   - Current head at (3,5). To reach (2,1), need to go left and down.\n   - Moving left to (2,5) is a step in that direction.\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - From (3,5), need to go left and up/down.\n   - Moving left to (2,5) is a step toward (1,3).\n3. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - From (3,5), need to go right and down.\n   - Moving right to (4,5) is a step toward (4,1).\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nWe want to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. All food items have value=1, so we can aim for the closest or safest one.\n\n- Moving left to (2,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,5) could be left to (1,5) or down to (2,4).\n  - (1,5) is part of the body, so can't go there unless it's the tail (which it's not; tail is at (2,5) now, but after moving, tail moves to (3,6)? Wait, let's see:\n    - After moving left to (2,5), the new snake positions would be: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n    - So tail is at (2,4).\n    - From (2,5), possible moves:\n      - Left to (1,5): (1,5) is in the body (from old positions), but after movement, (1,5) is still in the body (from new positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), etc.), so can't go left.\n      - Down to (2,4): (2,4) is the new tail. Is there food at (2,4)? No, so safe.\n      - Up to (2,6): opposite of current direction (from (3,5) to (2,5) is left, so current direction is left? Wait, initial direction was Down, but after moving left, direction is now Left.\n        - Wait, the head direction changes based on the move. Original direction was Down, we moved Left, so new direction is Left.\n        - So from (2,5) moving Left, next moves can't be Right (opposite of Left), so can be Left, Up, Down.\n        - Left to (1,5): blocked by body.\n        - Up to (2,6): is (2,6) in body? New body is (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), etc., so (2,6) is in body — can't go up.\n        - Down to (2,4): tail, no food, safe.\n    - So from (2,5), only safe move is down to (2,4), which doesn't lead toward food immediately.\n  \n- Moving right to (4,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (4,5) could be right to (5,5), down to (4,4), or up to (4,6).\n  - Right to (5,5): not a wall, not in body.\n  - Down to (4,4): not in body, not wall.\n  - Up to (4,6): not in body, not wall.\n  - This seems more open for future movement toward food at (4,1).\n\n- Moving down to (3,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,4) could be left to (2,4), right to (4,4), or down to (3,3).\n  - Left to (2,4): is (2,4) in body? Current body after moving down: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] — (2,4) is tail, no food, safe.\n  - Right to (4,4): not in body, not wall.\n  - Down to (3,3): not in body, not wall (but (3,2) is wall, but (3,3) is safe).\n  - This also seems safe but not directly toward food.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nMoving left seems to lead to a position where the only safe move is down, which might not be optimal for reaching food quickly. Moving right or down seems better for keeping options open.\n\nBetween right and down:\n- Moving right to (4,5) is closer to food at (4,1).\n- Moving down to (3,4) is not directly toward any food but keeps options open.\n\nGiven that food at (4,1) has a longer lifespan (10 turns), we can aim for that.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs any food adjacent to the current head (3,5)?\n- (2,1): no\n- (1,3): no\n- (4,1): no\n\nNo immediate food to eat in one move, so we should plan a path toward the nearest food.\n\n### Decision\n\nMoving right to (4,5) seems the best as it:\n- Is safe (no body or wall collision).\n- Moves toward food at (4,1) which has a long lifespan.\n- Keeps future options open for maneuvering.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail:\n     - Head: (4, 5)\n     - Body: (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving to the **Right (R)**.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food:\n     1. (2, 1) with value=1, life_span=1\n     2. (1, 3) with value=1, life_span=6\n     3. (4, 1) with value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations.\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head at (4,5)\n  - Next segment at (3,5)\n  - Then (3,6)\n  - Then (2,6)\n  - Then (1,6)\n  - Then (1,5)\n  - Then (1,4)\n  - Tail at (2,4)\n\n- **Food Locations**:\n  - (2,1)\n  - (1,3)\n  - (4,1)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move. So, possible immediate actions are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move to (5,5)\n   - Check for walls: x=5 is not a border wall (since x=7 is), and there are no internal walls at (5,5). So, it's a valid move.\n   - Check for body collision: The snake's body segments are at (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). (5,5) is not in this list, so no collision.\n   - Food at (5,5)? No food there.\n   - So, moving Right is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (4,6)\n   - Check walls: y=6 is not a border wall (y=7 is), no internal walls at (4,6).\n   - Body collision: Check if (4,6) is in body segments. Current body segments are (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). (4,6) is not in this list, so safe.\n   - Food at (4,6)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (4,4)\n   - Check walls: y=4 is not a border wall (y=0 is), no internal walls at (4,4).\n   - Body collision: (4,4) is not in the current body segments.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves (R, U, D) lead directly to food. However, let's look at the food positions and see if we can plan a path to reach them soon.\n\n1. **Food at (2,1)**:\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n   - Currently at (4,5), to reach (2,1) would require multiple moves: Left twice and Down four times, which is impossible in one move.\n   - Since it's about to disappear, we can ignore this food.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Life_span=6, so it will stay for a few more turns.\n   - From (4,5), path could be Left to (3,5), then Left to (2,5), Down to (2,4), Down to (2,3), Left to (1,3).\n   - But this is planning for future turns; current immediate move doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Life_span=9, plenty of time.\n   - From (4,5), need to move Down four times: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1).\n   - First move could be Down to (4,4).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (2,4).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), (2,5).\n- Head is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (2,4). So, no immediate danger here.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves\n\nGiven that none of the immediate moves lead to food, and all are safe, we can choose any. However, to maximize future opportunities:\n\n- Moving Down to (4,4) starts a path towards the food at (4,1).\n- Moving Right to (5,5) doesn't seem to lead towards any food currently.\n- Moving Up to (4,6) also doesn't seem advantageous right now.\n\nTherefore, moving Down seems the most strategic to eventually reach the food at (4,1).\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Down\n\nLet's ensure moving Down is safe:\n\n- New head position: (4,4)\n- Current body segments after move:\n  - Head moves to (4,4)\n  - Body segments become: (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n  - Tail (2,4) moves away, so the new tail is (1,4)\n- Check if (4,4) is in the new body segments: No, it's not in [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].\n- No walls at (4,4).\n- No food at (4,4) to cause any issues.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering future paths to food, the best immediate action is to move Down to position (4,4), which is safe and starts a path towards the food at (4,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Left (L) to (3, 4)\n\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (3, 4)?\n  - No food at (3, 4).\n- **Safety**:\n  - Safe move; no walls or body there.\n  - From (3,4), possible future moves can be considered.\n\n#### 3. Right (R) to (5, 4)\n\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (5, 4)?\n  - No food at (5, 4).\n- **Safety**:\n  - Safe move; no walls or body there.\n\n### Considering Food Proximity\n\nNow, let's see which move brings us closer to the available food:\n\n1. **Food at (1, 3)**:\n   - Current head: (4, 4)\n   - Distance: |4-1| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Moving Left (L) to (3,4): distance to (1,3) = |3-1| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 (closer)\n   - Moving Down (D) to (4,3): distance to (1,3) = |4-1| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3 (same as Left)\n   - Moving Right (R) to (5,4): distance to (1,3) = |5-1| + |4-3| = 4 + 1 = 5 (farther)\n\n2. **Food at (4, 1)**:\n   - Current head: (4, 4)\n   - Distance: |4-4| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3\n   - Moving Down (D) to (4,3): distance to (4,1) = |4-4| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2 (closer)\n   - Moving Left (L) to (3,4): distance to (4,1) = |3-4| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 (farther)\n   - Moving Right (R) to (5,4): distance to (4,1) = |5-4| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 (farther)\n\n**Observations**:\n- Moving Left (L) gets us closer to (1,3) but farther from (4,1).\n- Moving Down (D) gets us closer to (4,1) and maintains the same distance to (1,3) as Left.\n- Moving Right (R) takes us away from both foods.\n\nBetween Left and Down, Down seems better because:\n- It gets us closer to (4,1), which is directly below us.\n- It doesn't worsen the distance to (1,3) compared to Left.\n- Moving Down seems more straightforward towards the food at (4,1).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe must ensure that moving Down doesn't lead to a situation where the head is adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail cell that could be eaten next, causing a collision.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,4). After moving Down:\n- New head: (4,3)\n- New tail: The tail was (1,4), but since we're moving and not eating, the tail moves to the next segment: (1,5).\n- Distance from (4,3) to (1,5): |4-1| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5 (not adjacent)\n- No immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Down\n\nAfter moving Down to (4,3), next possible moves:\n- From (4,3), direction is Down (but we can't go Up next, which is opposite).\n- Possible moves: Left, Right, Down.\n  - Down to (4,2): \n    - Not a wall (y=2 is not border; internal wall is at (3,2), so (4,2) is safe.\n    - Not in body (current body after move: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc.; (4,2) not there).\n    - Valid.\n  - Left to (3,3):\n    - Not a wall (x=3, y=3 is not a wall).\n    - Not in body.\n    - Valid.\n  - Right to (5,3):\n    - Not a wall.\n    - Not in body.\n    - Valid.\n\nThis seems safe and continues towards (4,1).\n\n### Alternative: Moving Left to (3,4)\n\nIf we move Left to (3,4):\n- Next possible moves: Left, Up, Down (can't go Right, opposite of Left).\n  - Left to (2,4):\n    - Not a wall.\n    - Not in body.\n    - Valid.\n  - Up to (3,5):\n    - Body segment is at (3,5) - collision.\n    - Invalid.\n  - Down to (3,3):\n    - Not wall or body.\n    - Valid.\n  \nThis path seems to be moving towards (1,3), but it's a longer path compared to moving Down towards (4,1).\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Down and Left, Down is more advantageous because:\n1. It directly moves towards the food at (4,1), reducing the distance.\n2. It doesn't worsen the path to (1,3).\n3. It's a safe move with no immediate or apparent future dangers.\n4. Moving Left would take us on a longer path towards (1,3), and we have a closer food at (4,1).\n\nMoving Right takes us away from both foods, so it's less optimal.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions After Down\n\nAfter moving Down to (4,3):\n- New head: (4,3)\n- New body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n- Tail was (1,4), which moves off, so (1,5) is the new tail.\n- No part of the body is at (4,3), so no collision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the proximity to food and safety, the best immediate action is to move **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake can't go beyond these coordinates).\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 2) — the snake can't move here.\n3. **Snake Position**: \n   - Head at (4, 3), followed by body segments: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5).\n   - Current direction: Down (D) — meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 3): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (4, 1): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (2, 2): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,3) and direction D (down), the possible next moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 2)\n- **Left (L)**: (3, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 3)\n\nWe cannot move Up (U) because that would be an instant reverse (from D to U), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (4, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=2 is not a border wall, and (4,2) is not an internal obstacle.\n  - Body: The body segments are at (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). (4,2) is not in this list.\n- Food: \n  - No food at (4,2).\n- Conclusion: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=3 is not a border wall, and (3,3) is not an internal obstacle (internal obstacle is at (3,2)).\n  - Body: (3,3) is not in the body segments.\n- Food:\n  - No food at (3,3).\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=5 is not a border wall, no internal obstacles at (5,3).\n  - Body: (5,3) is not in the body segments.\n- Food:\n  - No food at (5,3).\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable soon or if moving towards them is beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Value: 5, life_span: 1 (will disappear next turn).\n   - Current head at (4,3). To reach (1,3), need to move left three times: L, L, L.\n   - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear before we can reach it. Not worth pursuing.\n\n2. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Value: 7, life_span: 1.\n   - From (4,3), can move D to (4,2), then D to (4,1).\n   - But life_span is 1, so after this turn, it will disappear. Can't reach it in one move. Not reachable.\n\n3. **Food at (2,2)**:\n   - Value: 10, life_span: 1.\n   - From (4,3), possible path: L to (3,3), then L to (2,3), then D to (2,2).\n   - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear before we can reach it. Not reachable.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nWe also need to check if moving in any direction would place the head adjacent to the tail where the tail has positive food, which could be dangerous if eaten next.\n\n- Tail is at (1,5).\n- Current head is at (4,3). Adjacent cells to tail (1,5) are:\n  - (0,5) — wall (x=0 is border)\n  - (2,5)\n  - (1,4)\n  - (1,6) — already part of the body\n- None of these are reachable from the current head position in one move, so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body, and none lead directly to food this turn. Since all foods have life_span=1, they will disappear next turn, so we can't reach any of them in time.\n\nGiven that, we can choose any safe move. Let's consider the future implications:\n\n- Moving Down (D) to (4,2):\n  - Next moves could be D to (4,1) (but wall at y=0 is at y=0, so (4,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle), or L/R.\n- Moving Left (L) to (3,3):\n  - Opens up more options towards the left side of the grid.\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,3):\n  - Moves towards the right side.\n\nSince the snake is currently near the left side (head at x=4, with body extending left), moving right might open up more space. \n\nAlternatively, moving down keeps us in the middle, and moving left takes us closer to the left wall, which might limit future moves.\n\n**Best immediate action**: Move Right (R) to (5,3), as it moves the snake towards the more open right side of the grid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail: [(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)].\n     - Head is at (5, 3).\n     - Tail is at (1, 6).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving to the **Right (R)**.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food:\n     1. (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 4\n     2. (4, 1): value = 1, life_span = 6\n     3. (2, 2): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 3) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3) — But this is the opposite of current direction (R), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3)\n\nSo, the allowed moves are U, D, and R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential benefits (eating food).\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6, 3)\n\n- **Position**: (6, 3)\n- **Wall Check**: x=6 is not a border wall (border is x=7), and there are no internal walls at (6, 3). Safe.\n- **Body Collision Check**: \n  - Current body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n  - (6,3) is not in this list. Safe.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (6,3). Just a safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5, 4)\n\n- **Position**: (5, 4)\n- **Wall Check**: y=4 is not a border wall. No internal walls at (5,4). Safe.\n- **Body Collision Check**:\n  - (5,4) is not in the body segments. Safe.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5,4). Safe but no reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5, 2)\n\n- **Position**: (5, 2)\n- **Wall Check**: y=2 is not a border wall. Internal walls: (3,2) is a wall, but (5,2) is not listed as a wall. Safe.\n- **Body Collision Check**:\n  - (5,2) is not in the body segments. Safe.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5,2). Safe but no reward.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nCurrently, the snake is at (5,3). Let's see if any food is adjacent that we can aim for in the next moves:\n\n1. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Distance from head (5,3): 4 units left (x difference).\n   - Not adjacent; can't reach in one move.\n   \n2. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Distance: (5-4=1 in x, 3-1=2 in y). Not adjacent.\n   \n3. **Food at (2,2)**:\n   - Distance: (5-2=3 in x, 3-2=1 in y). Not adjacent.\n\nNone of the food is adjacent to the head right now, so we can't eat any food in the immediate next move. Therefore, the immediate priority is to move safely without colliding.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nWhile we can't eat food now, we can consider moving towards the nearest food to position ourselves better in future turns.\n\n- **Food at (4,1)**:\n  - From (5,3), moving Down (D) to (5,2) gets us closer in the y-direction (from y=3 to y=2).\n  - Then, from (5,2), moving Left (L) to (4,2) would be next, but we'd need to check if that's safe then.\n  \n- **Food at (2,2)**:\n  - From (5,3), moving Left (L) is not allowed (opposite of current direction R).\n  - So, we'd need to go Down (D) to (5,2), then Left to (4,2), then Left to (3,2) — but (3,2) is a wall, so that path is blocked.\n  \n- **Food at (1,3)**:\n  - To reach (1,3), we'd need to go Left multiple times, but currently, we can't go Left (opposite direction).\n  - Alternative path: Down to (5,2), Left to (4,2), Left to (3,2) — blocked by wall at (3,2).\n  \nGiven these, the most promising seems to be moving towards (4,1):\n\n1. Move Down (D) to (5,2).\n2. Next turn, if possible, move Left to (4,2).\n3. Then Down to (4,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut we need to ensure that after moving Down to (5,2), the next moves are safe.\n\n### Checking Safety After Down Move\n\nIf we move Down to (5,2):\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n- Body segments: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)]\n- Tail was at (1,6), which moves to (2,6) (since the head moves to (5,2), the tail moves forward from (1,6) to (2,6)).\n\nNow, from (5,2), possible next moves:\n\n- Left (L) to (4,2):\n  - Check walls: (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (4,2) is not in [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)] — safe.\n  \nThen from (4,2), Down to (4,1) to eat the food at (4,1).\n\nThis seems like a viable path.\n\n### Alternative: Moving Right\n\nIf we move Right to (6,3):\n\n- New head: (6,3)\n- Body: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)]\n- Tail moves to (2,6).\n\nFrom (6,3), possible moves:\n- Up to (6,4)\n- Down to (6,2)\n- Right to (7,3) — but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  \nThis doesn't seem to lead us closer to any food immediately.\n\n### Alternative: Moving Up\n\nMoving Up to (5,4):\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)]\n- Tail moves to (2,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves:\n- Left to (4,4) — but (4,4) is in the body (next segment is (5,3), then (4,3), etc., but (4,4) is the third segment. Wait, the body after moving up is [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), ...], so (4,4) is the fourth segment. Moving left to (4,4) would collide with the body. So Left is unsafe.\n- Right to (6,4)\n- Up to (5,5)\n- Down to (5,3) — but that's the opposite direction (from Up to Down), so not allowed.\n\nSo from (5,4), only Right or Up are allowed, neither leads directly to food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most promising immediate move is **Down (D) to (5,2)**, as it starts us on a path towards the food at (4,1), and the move itself is safe with no immediate threats.\n\nOther moves (Right or Up) don't lead directly towards food and may not be as strategically beneficial in the immediate future.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

However:\n\n1. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Down (D), which means it cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) on the next move.\n   - **Allowed moves**: Down (D), Left (L), Right (R)\n\n2. **Wall and Body Collisions**:\n   - We need to check each allowed direction to see if moving there would cause a collision with the wall or the snake's body (excluding the tail, since the tail will move forward).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Down (D) - (x, y-1)\n   - Current head: (5, 2)\n   - New head position: (5, 1)\n   - Check:\n     - **Wall**: y=1 is not a border wall (border is y=0). No internal wall at (5,1).\n     - **Body**: Check if (5,1) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Snake body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)\n       - (5,1) is not in the body.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n#### 2. Left (L) - (x-1, y)\n   - Current head: (5, 2)\n   - New head position: (4, 2)\n   - Check:\n     - **Wall**: x=4 is not a border wall. Internal walls: (3,2) is not (4,2).\n     - **Body**: Is (4,2) in the snake's body?\n       - Snake body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6)\n       - (4,2) is not in the body.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n#### 3. Right (R) - (x+1, y)\n   - Current head: (5, 2)\n   - New head position: (6, 2)\n   - Check:\n     - **Wall**: x=6 is not a border wall (border is x=7). No internal wall at (6,2).\n     - **Body**: Is (6,2) in the snake's body?\n       - Snake body does not include (6,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are valid in terms of not causing immediate collisions.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any of the valid moves lead to eating food, considering the food's position and value.\n\n**Food List**:\n1. (1, 3): value = +1, life_span = 3\n   - Distance from head (5,2): Manhattan distance = |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n2. (4, 1): value = +1, life_span = 5\n   - Distance from head (5,2): |5-4| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Can reach in two moves: e.g., Down to (5,1), then Left to (4,1).\n   - But not directly in one move.\n3. (2, 2): value = +1, life_span = 8\n   - Distance from head (5,2): |5-2| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n   - Can reach in three moves: e.g., Left to (4,2), Left to (3,2) [but (3,2) is a wall], so this path is blocked.\n   - Alternative path: Left to (4,2), Down to (4,1), Left to (3,1), but this is longer and not direct.\n\nNone of the food can be eaten in the immediate next move (turn t0). Therefore, the immediate goal is to move towards food while avoiding getting trapped or colliding in future moves.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that:\n1. Keeps future options open (not getting trapped).\n2. Moves towards the nearest accessible food.\n\nLet's consider the positions after each move:\n\n#### Move Down (D) to (5,1):\n   - Next head: (5,1)\n   - From here, possible moves (next direction is D, so cannot go U):\n     - D: (5,0) - y=0 is wall. Invalid.\n     - L: (4,1) - leads towards food at (4,1).\n     - R: (6,1) - no immediate benefit.\n   - Moving Down now allows us to go Left next to reach (4,1).\n\n#### Move Left (L) to (4,2):\n   - Next head: (4,2)\n   - From here, possible moves (current direction is L, cannot go R):\n     - U: (4,3) - is the snake's body (5,3) is next to head, but (4,3) is body segment. Wait, let's see:\n       - Current body after moving head to (4,2):\n         - New body: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), ...]\n         - So (4,3) is not in the new body yet (original (5,3) is now at (5,2), etc.\n       - Wait, need to correctly update the body after move.\n   - Actually, after moving head to (4,2), the body becomes:\n     - Head: (4,2)\n     - Next: (5,2) (previous head)\n     - Then: (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n     - So possible moves:\n       - U: (4,3) - is (4,3) in the new body? Original (4,3) is now at (5,3), so (4,3) is not in new body.\n       - D: (4,1) - not wall or body.\n       - L: (3,2) - is a wall. Invalid.\n   - So from (4,2), can go U to (4,3) or D to (4,1).\n     - (4,1) is food, so next move can eat it.\n   - So moving Left now sets up to eat (4,1) next turn.\n\n#### Move Right (R) to (6,2):\n   - Next head: (6,2)\n   - From here, possible moves (current direction is R, cannot go L):\n     - U: (6,3) - no food, not wall or body.\n     - D: (6,1) - no food, not wall or body.\n     - R: (7,2) - x=7 is wall. Invalid.\n   - Doesn't lead directly towards any food.\n\nBetween Down and Left, both can lead to food in two moves:\n- Down now, then Left to (4,1).\n- Left now, then Down to (4,1).\n\nBut moving Left now allows us to reach (4,1) in the next move, which is more direct. Also, moving Down first would place the head at (5,1), and then Left to (4,1), but (4,1) is food with life_span=5, so it will be there for 5 more turns after current (including current turn decrement), so it's safe.\n\nHowever, moving Left now to (4,2) and then Down to (4,1) is equally valid. \n\nAnother consideration is the tail's position. The tail is at (2,6), which is far, so no immediate danger from tail reward danger.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (2,6).\n- Head is at (5,2).\n- Manhattan distance between head and tail: |5-2| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7, which is more than 1, so not adjacent.\n- So no tail reward danger in any move.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth Down and Left moves are safe and can lead to food in the next move. However, moving Left now allows us to reach the food at (4,1) in the next move directly by going Down, which seems more straightforward.\n\nMoving Right doesn't lead towards any food and may limit future options.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to position (4,2), setting up to move Down to (4,1) next turn to eat the food there.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

No, tail is at (3, 6).\n     - **Invalid** (collision with body).\n   \n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (4, 1)\n   - Check (4, 1):\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but y=1 is not.\n     - Body segments: Is (4, 1) in the body? Let's see: [(4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6)] → No.\n     - Food at (4, 1): Yes, value = +1.\n     - **Tail Reward Danger**: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n       - Head is at (4, 2), tail at (3, 6).\n       - Adjacent means one move away: (4,2) and (3,6) are not adjacent (distance is |4-3| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 > 1).\n       - So no tail reward danger.\n     - **Valid Move**: Can move Down to (4, 1) and eat positive food.\n\n### Checking Other Food Items for Potential Paths\n\nWhile Down seems valid, let's see if other moves could be better by considering other food:\n\n- (1, 3): Distance from (4,2) is |4-1| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n- (2, 2): Distance is |4-2| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n- (2, 6): Distance is |4-2| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nThe closest is (2, 2) with distance 2. Can we reach it?\n\nFrom (4,2), to reach (2,2):\n- Path: Left to (3,2) is blocked by wall.\n- Alternative: Down to (4,1), then Left to (3,1), then Up to (3,2) is blocked.\nNot straightforward.\n\nNext closest is (1,3) at distance 4, but path is unclear due to walls and body.\n\n(4,1) is immediately accessible by Down, and it's positive food with life_span=4 (enough time).\n\n### Verifying Down (D) Move to (4, 1)\n\n- New head position: (4, 1).\n- Current body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6)].\n- After moving, the tail (3,6) moves away, and the body grows by one because we ate food.\n- New body: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)].\n   - (3,6) is removed (tail moves forward).\n   - Length increases by 1.\n\nNo immediate collisions or dangers detected.\n\n### Checking Other Options\n\nIs there any other move that could be better?\n\n- If we consider waiting or moving away from food, it's generally not optimal unless avoiding danger.\n- Here, Down is safe and leads to immediate reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and most rewarding immediate action is to move Down (D) to (4, 1), eating the positive food there.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 41  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first):\n1. Head: (4, 1)\n2. (4, 2)\n3. (5, 2)\n4. (5, 3)\n5. (4, 3)\n6. (4, 4)\n7. (4, 5)\n8. (3, 5)\n9. Tail: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Down (D)  \nThis means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn (from (4,0) to (4,1), but since y=0 is a wall, the snake must have come from above, but the previous position isn't given, so we'll assume it's moving down now.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 1\n2. (2, 2): value = 1, life_span = 6\n3. (2, 6): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,1), moving Down (D) would go to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid.  \nCurrent direction is D, so we can't instantly reverse to U (unless the snake can't move otherwise, but let's see other options).\n\nOther possible moves from (4,1):\n- Left (L): (3,1)\n- Right (R): (5,1)\n\nSo possible actions: L or R (U is opposite of current direction D, so not allowed unless no other options, but we have L and R).\n\n### Checking Move Validity\n\n**Move Left (L) to (3,1)**:\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,1) is not a wall (walls are x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,2) is an obstacle, but (3,1) is clear).\n  - Body: Snake body segments are (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6). (3,1) is not in these.\n- Safe to move to (3,1).\n\n**Move Right (R) to (5,1)**:\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (5,1) is not.\n  - Body: Check if (5,1) is in body segments. Current body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc. (5,1) is not in these.\n- Safe to move to (5,1).\n\nBoth L and R are safe moves. Now let's see which is better in terms of food.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nCurrent head is at (4,1). Foods are at:\n1. (1,3): distance = |4-1| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n2. (2,2): distance = 2 + 1 = 3\n3. (2,6): distance = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nClosest is (2,2). Let's see how to get closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,1):\n- Move L to (3,1): then distance to (2,2) is 1 + 1 = 2\n- Move R to (5,1): then distance to (2,2) is 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo moving L gets us closer to (2,2).\n\nAlso, (2,2) has life_span = 6, so it's not disappearing soon.\n\nOther food at (1,3) has life_span = 1, so it will disappear next turn, but it's farther and moving L doesn't help much to reach it quickly.\n\n(2,6) is too far for now.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could cause a collision if eaten?\n\nTail is at (3,6). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (2,6), (4,6), (3,5), (3,7) (but y=7 is wall)\nFood at (2,6): positive, value=1.\n\nBut the head is at (4,1), far from tail, so no immediate danger of head being adjacent to tail and eating tail's food.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nIf we move L to (3,1), next possible moves:\n- From (3,1), direction is L (if we continue L), but then next move could be D to (3,0) which is wall, or U to (3,2) which is obstacle, or L to (2,1), R to (4,1) (but that's back to body).\nSo from (3,1), best might be U to (3,2), but (3,2) is obstacle, so not possible. Then maybe L to (2,1), then can go towards (2,2).\n\nAlternatively, move R to (5,1), then next could be U to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, so no. Or R to (6,1), then can go U to (6,2), etc.\n\nMoving L seems better to approach (2,2).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween L and R, moving L gets us closer to the nearest positive food at (2,2) without immediate risks. Moving R doesn't provide a clear advantage and may lead us away from food.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

No.\n- Outcome: Just move left to empty cell.

So, invalid move.\n  \nWait, the internal obstacle is at (3,2), so moving Up to (3,2) is invalid because it's a wall.\n\nHmm, seems like Up is invalid due to the wall. So only Left is possible.\n\nBut let me double-check the snake body positions to ensure (3,2) isn't part of the body. The body starts at (4,1), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). So (3,2) isn't in the body, but it is a wall.\n\nSo only Left is valid.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's check if moving Left to (2,1) is safe in terms of future moves. \n\nAfter moving Left to (2,1), next turn the head is at (2,1), direction is L. Possible moves then would be L to (1,1), U to (2,2), or D to (2,0) (but y=0 is wall, so invalid). \n\nAt (2,2) there's food with value=6, life_span=1. Since this is turn 42, and the food disappears after this turn (life_span=1), next turn it will be gone. So no food to eat next turn at (2,2).\n\nBut wait, the food at (2,2) has life_span=1 at turn 42, meaning it disappears after turn 42 (i.e., it's there at turn 42 but gone at turn 43). So if we move to (2,1) now, next turn we could move up to (2,2), but the food would be gone by then.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (2,6) is also life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n\nGiven that, the only valid move is Left to (2,1), which is safe (no collision, no food to eat, no immediate danger).\n\nBut is there any other consideration? Like the tail reward danger?\n\nThe tail is at (3,5). The head is at (3,1), so not adjacent to the tail. So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake Body\n\nThe food positions are (2,2) and (2,6). Neither is under the snake's body currently.

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 43  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, with some internal obstacles).\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2) — this is a single cell that's blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (2,1), followed by:\n- (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo the snake's body is quite long, with segments scattered around.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left) — meaning the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2,2) — value: +1, life span: 5\n2. (2,6) — value: +1, life span: 7\n3. (1,1) — value: +1, life span: 10\n\nAll foods are positive (+1), none are negative in this case.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,1) and direction L (Left), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1,1) — but the snake is already moving left, and this would be continuing in the same direction.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,2)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,0) — but y=0 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n  \nWe cannot move Right (R) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (L), and instant reverse is not allowed.\n\nSo valid moves are: Left (L) to (1,1) or Up (U) to (2,2).\n\n### Analyzing Each Move\n\n**Option 1: Move Left to (1,1)**\n- New head position: (1,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=1 is within bounds, y=1 is within bounds. No wall at (1,1).\n  - Body collision: Check if (1,1) is in the snake's body. Current body segments are from (3,1) onwards, so (1,1) is not in the body — safe.\n- Food at (1,1): Yes, there's food here with value +1.\n  - Check Tail Reward Danger: After eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the new tail is the current tail (4,5). The new head is (1,1), and the segment after head is (2,1). Is (4,5) adjacent to (1,1)? \n    - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n    - (1,1) and (4,5): x diff is 3, y diff is 4 — not adjacent. So no danger.\n  - So eating this food is safe and beneficial.\n  \n**Option 2: Move Up to (2,2)**\n- New head position: (2,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (2,2) is within bounds, no internal wall there.\n  - Body collision: Is (2,2) in the snake's body? Current body: (3,1), (4,1), ..., (4,5) — (2,2) is not in the body — safe.\n- Food at (2,2): Yes, value +1.\n  - Tail Reward Danger: After eating, new tail is (4,5). Is (4,5) adjacent to (2,2)?\n    - x diff: 2, y diff: 3 — not adjacent. Safe to eat.\n  \nBoth moves seem safe and lead to eating positive food. Now, let's see which is better.\n\n### Comparing the Two Options\n\n1. **Move Left to (1,1)**:\n   - Eats food at (1,1) with life span 10.\n   - After moving left, the next moves from (1,1) could be:\n     - Left: (0,1) — x=0 is wall, invalid.\n     - Up: (1,2)\n     - Down: (1,0) — y=0 is wall, invalid.\n     - Right: (2,1) — but current direction is L, so R is opposite, which is not allowed next turn.\n   - So next turn, only possible moves would be Up to (1,2).\n\n2. **Move Up to (2,2)**:\n   - Eats food at (2,2) with life span 5.\n   - After moving up, direction is U, so next moves from (2,2):\n     - Up: (2,3)\n     - Left: (1,2) — opposite is D, so L is allowed.\n     - Right: (3,2) — but (3,2) is an internal obstacle (wall), so invalid.\n     - Down: (2,1) — opposite of U, not allowed.\n   - So next turn, possible moves would be Up to (2,3) or Left to (1,2).\n\n**Food Lifespans**:\n- (2,2): life span 5 — current turn is 43, so disappears at turn 48.\n- (1,1): life span 10 — disappears at turn 53.\n- (2,6): life span 7 — disappears at turn 50.\n\nBoth foods will be around for a while, but (2,2) disappears sooner. Maybe prioritize that?\n\nAlso, after moving to (1,1), the next move is forced to be Up to (1,2), which doesn't have food. After moving to (2,2), next move can be Up to (2,3) or Left to (1,2). (2,3) is part of the snake's body (from current positions: ..., (5,3), (4,3), ...), so moving Up to (2,3) would collide with body. So only Left to (1,2) is safe, which doesn't have food.\n\nSo both options lead to a similar immediate gain but limit future moves. Maybe choose the one where the food disappears sooner to not miss it.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in choosing one over the other?\n\n- Moving Left to (1,1): \n  - Next move is forced to Up to (1,2), which is safe (no body or wall).\n  - Then from (1,2), possible moves: Left (0,2) — wall; Up (1,3); Down (1,1) — but (1,1) is where the head was two turns ago, but the tail would have moved, need to see.\n  \n- Moving Up to (2,2):\n  - Next move is Left to (1,2), safe.\n  - Then from (1,2), similar as above.\n\nBoth seem similarly safe in the immediate future.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that both moves lead to eating +1 food safely, and both have similar future move constraints, I might prefer to eat the food that's going to disappear sooner, which is at (2,2) (life span 5 vs. 10 at (1,1)).\n\nAlso, moving Up to (2,2) keeps the snake more centralized, whereas moving Left to (1,1) pushes the snake towards the edge, which might limit future movements more.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nAfter considering all factors, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (2,2) to eat the positive food there safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), with borders at these limits. There's also an internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list starting from the head to the tail. Here's the sequence:\n     - Head: (2, 3)\n     - Next segments: (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving Up (\"U\").\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (2, 6): value = +1, life_span = 5\n   - (1, 1): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2, 3) moving Up (\"U\"), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (2, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: Not allowed (opposite of current direction)\n- **Left (L)**: (1, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (3, 3)\n\nSo, the valid moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (2, 4)\n- **Position**: (2, 4)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is the upper wall; (2,4) is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacle**: (3,2) is not (2,4).\n  - **Body Collision**: Check if (2,4) is in the snake's body segments.\n    - Current body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n    - (2,4) is not in the body. The tail is at (4,4), but that's not the same.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (2,4)?\n  - Food is at (2,6) and (1,1) — no.\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moving up doesn't lead to immediate food but is safe.\n  - The tail is at (4,4), and the head would be at (2,4), so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n- **Position**: (1, 3)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is the left wall; (1,3) is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacle**: (3,2) is not (1,3).\n  - **Body Collision**: Check if (1,3) is in the body.\n    - Not in the current body segments.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (1,3)?\n  - No, food is at (2,6) and (1,1).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Safe move, no immediate food.\n  - Moving left could be strategic to approach the food at (1,1) in future moves.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3, 3)\n- **Position**: (3, 3)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is the right wall; (3,3) is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacle**: (3,2) is below (3,3), so no collision.\n  - **Body Collision**: Check if (3,3) is in the body.\n    - Current body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n    - (3,3) is not in the body.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (3,3)?\n  - No.\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Safe move, no immediate food.\n  - Moving right doesn't seem to lead directly towards any food currently.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nLet's look at the two food items:\n\n1. **Food at (2,6)**:\n   - Current head at (2,3). To reach (2,6), need to move up three times.\n   - Next move up to (2,4), then (2,5), then (2,6).\n   - Need to ensure that moving up is safe each time.\n\n2. **Food at (1,1)**:\n   - Current head at (2,3). To reach (1,1), possible path:\n     - Left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,1).\n     - Need to check for collisions at each step.\n\n### Potential Path to (2,6)\n\nIf we choose to go for the food at (2,6):\n- Next move: U to (2,4)\n- Then next turn: U to (2,5) (assuming no new obstacles)\n- Then next turn: U to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nBut we need to check if moving up now is safe, which it is.\n\n### Potential Path to (1,1)\n\nIf we choose to go for the food at (1,1):\n- Next move: L to (1,3)\n- Then next turn: D to (1,2) (must ensure not to reverse direction immediately, but current direction is U, so D is allowed)\n- Then next turn: D to (1,1) to eat the food.\n\nHowever, at (1,1), the current body includes (2,1) and (3,1), but (1,1) is not part of the body, so it's safe to eat.\n\n### Comparing Both Paths\n\n- **Food at (2,6)**:\n  - Life_span = 5. Current turn is 45, so it disappears at turn 50.\n  - Distance: 3 moves away.\n- **Food at (1,1)**:\n  - Life_span = 8. Disappears at turn 53.\n  - Distance: 3 moves away.\n\nBoth foods have the same value (+1) and are equally distant. The food at (2,6) will disappear sooner, so it might be better to prioritize that one to ensure we don't miss it.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is about the tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,4). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5)\n\nHead is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (4,4), so no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that both foods are equally valuable and distant, but the one at (2,6) will disappear sooner, it's better to start moving towards it now.\n\n**Next Move**: Up (U) to (2,4)\n\nThis is safe (no collisions), and it's the first step towards the food at (2,6).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving to (2,4):\n- New head: (2,4)\n- Body: [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)]\n  - The tail was at (4,4), which moves away to (4,3), so no collision.\n- Next possible moves from (2,4) would be U, L, R (not D, opposite of U).\n\nThis seems safe.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully evaluating all possible moves and considering the positions and lifespans of the food items, the best immediate action is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(2,6): Above the head (current y=4, food at y=6)\n2. (1,1): Below and to the left of the head (x=1, y=1)\n3. (5,4): Same y as head, to the right (x=5, y=4)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (2,4) and Direction \"U\"\n\nFrom the current head position (2,4) moving Up (\"U\"), the possible next moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (2,5)\n  - Check if this is a valid move:\n    - Not a wall: (2,5) is not on x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and not (3,2) — valid.\n    - Not colliding with body: Check if (2,5) is in the snake's body segments.\n      - Current body segments: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n      - (2,5) is not in this list — safe.\n    - No instant reverse: Current direction is U, opposite is D — moving U is allowed.\n  \n- **Left (L)**: (1,4)\n  - Check validity:\n    - Not a wall: (1,4) is not on borders or (3,2) — valid.\n    - Not colliding with body: (1,4) is not in body segments — safe.\n    - No instant reverse: Current direction is U, opposite is D — moving L is allowed (not opposite).\n  \n- **Right (R)**: (3,4)\n  - Check validity:\n    - Not a wall: (3,4) is not on borders or (3,2) — but (3,2) is an internal wall at y=2, so (3,4) is safe.\n    - Not colliding with body: (3,4) is not in body segments — safe.\n    - No instant reverse: Moving R is allowed.\n\n- **Down (D)**: (2,3)\n  - Check validity:\n    - Not a wall: (2,3) is not a wall.\n    - Collision check: (2,3) is the first body segment — this would be a collision unless it's the tail that's about to move.\n      - The tail is at (4,3). The segment at (2,3) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Moving D would make the head go to (2,3), which is occupied by the body — this is a collision. Hence, D is invalid.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see where the foods are relative to the head and which moves might lead to eating them.\n\n1. **Food at (2,6)**:\n   - Current head: (2,4)\n   - To reach (2,6), need to move U twice: (2,5), then (2,6).\n   - Moving U now is a step towards this food.\n   - Life span is 4, so it will disappear in 4 turns (including current turn), meaning it's available until turn 49.\n\n2. **Food at (1,1)**:\n   - Current head: (2,4)\n   - To reach (1,1), need to move left and down multiple times.\n   - Moving L now is a step towards it, but it's quite far.\n   - Life span is 7, so available until turn 52.\n\n3. **Food at (5,4)**:\n   - Current head: (2,4)\n   - Same y-coordinate, need to move right to x=5.\n   - Moving R now is a step towards it.\n   - Life span is 10, so available until turn 55.\n\n### Potential Moves and Their Outcomes\n\nLet's evaluate each valid move:\n\n1. **Move U (to (2,5))**:\n   - Next to food at (2,6) — can potentially eat it next turn.\n   - No immediate collision risks.\n   - Doesn't move towards other foods, but (2,6) is close.\n\n2. **Move L (to (1,4))**:\n   - Moves towards food at (1,1), but still far.\n   - No immediate collision risks.\n   - Moves away from other foods.\n\n3. **Move R (to (3,4))**:\n   - Moves towards food at (5,4).\n   - No immediate collision risks.\n   - Moves away from other foods.\n\n### Considering \"Tail Reward Danger\"\n\nWe must check if moving to any cell adjacent to the tail could lead to eating positive food where the head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4)\nFood is at (1,1), (2,6), (5,4) — none are adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nWe have three foods, all with value +1. Prioritize the closest or most urgent (lowest life span):\n\n1. (2,6): life_span=4 (disappears soon), distance=2 (need 2 U moves)\n2. (1,1): life_span=7, distance= |2-1| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n3. (5,4): life_span=10, distance= |5-2| + |4-4| = 3\n\n(2,6) is the most urgent and closest in terms of steps needed (only 2 U moves). Moving U now is optimal to reach it before it disappears.\n\nOther moves (L or R) would take us away from (2,6), and we might not reach other foods in time given their distances.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving U\n\nMoving U to (2,5):\n- Next turn, head at (2,5), then can move U to (2,6) to eat food.\n- Check if eating (2,6) causes tail collision:\n  - Current tail is at (4,3). After eating, the tail grows by one, so the new tail would be the last segment before the current tail, which is (5,3).\n  - New head at (2,6), new tail at (5,3) — no adjacency, so safe.\n\n### Checking for Other Immediate Dangers\n\nAre there any immediate dangers in moving U now?\n- Next position (2,5):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not in body segments.\n  - Not adjacent to tail with positive food (as established).\n  \nSafe move.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nCould moving L or R be better for some reason?\n- Moving L: heads towards (1,1), but it's far and not urgent.\n- Moving R: heads towards (5,4), also not urgent.\nBoth would delay reaching (2,6), which might disappear soon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe optimal immediate action is to move Up (\"U\") to position (2,5), setting up to eat the positive food at (2,6) on the next turn before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 47  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2) — this is a single cell that's blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first, then body segments):\n1. Head: (2, 5)\n2. Body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nSo, the snake's length is 10 segments.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food Items** (each given as (x, y, life_span, value)):\n1. (2, 6, 3, 1) — positive food at (2,6), life span 3, value +1\n2. (1, 1, 6, 1) — positive food at (1,1), life span 6, value +1\n3. (5, 4, 9, 1) — positive food at (5,4), life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, so no negative food to worry about here.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,5) with direction U (Up), the possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (2,6)\n- L (Left): (1,5)\n- R (Right): (3,5)\n\nCannot move D (Down) because that would be the opposite of the current direction U, which is not allowed (\"no instant reverse\").\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move U to (2,6)\n- Check if (2,6) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7; (2,6) is within bounds.\n  - Not an internal obstacle: only (3,2) is blocked.\n  - Not part of the snake's body (excluding the tail which moves away):\n    - Snake body segments: (2,4) to (5,3). (2,6) is not in this list.\n  \n- Food at (2,6): Yes, there's positive food with life span 3, value +1.\n  \n  **Special Case Check - Tail Reward Danger**:\n  - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail would be the current tail (5,3).\n  - Is the head adjacent to the new tail after moving?\n    - New head: (2,6)\n    - New tail: (5,3)\n    - Distance: |2-5| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n    - So no danger here.\n  \n  - Also, the food is not under the snake's body (since (2,6) is not in the body), so no need to check that special case.\n  \n- So, moving U is safe and would eat the food at (2,6), increasing length to 11 and score by +1.\n\n#### 2. Move L to (1,5)\n- Check (1,5):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an obstacle.\n  - Not in snake body.\n  \n- Food at (1,5)? No, no food listed there.\n  \n- This move is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n#### 3. Move R to (3,5)\n- Check (3,5):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an obstacle (only (3,2) is blocked).\n  - Not in snake body.\n  \n- Food at (3,5)? No, no food listed there.\n  \n- This move is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- U: Eats food at (2,6), safe, increases score and length.\n- L: Safe, no food.\n- R: Safe, no food.\n\nBetween these, moving U is the best as it gets us food without any risks.\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\n- Food life spans:\n  - (2,6): life span 3 — will disappear after 3 more turns (including this one if not eaten now).\n  - (1,1): life span 6 — can wait.\n  - (5,4): life span 9 — can wait.\n  \nSo, (2,6) is the most urgent food to eat if we want it, but it's not disappearing immediately (has 3 turns left).\n\nHowever, since moving U is safe and gets us food now, and the other moves don't get food, it's better to take the food now rather than wait.\n\nAlso, moving U doesn't block any future paths significantly. The snake is long, but we're moving towards the top border (y=7), but (2,6) is one step below y=7, so next move from (2,6) would have to be L or R (can't go U to (2,7) which is a wall). But that's a future consideration; for now, eating is good.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After U\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), next turn:\n- Head at (2,6), direction U.\n- Possible moves: L (1,6), R (3,6), can't go D (opposite of U).\n  \nFrom (2,6), moving L to (1,6) or R to (3,6) would keep us near the top, but no immediate food there. But that's okay; we can plan then.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Not Taking Food Now\n\nIf we choose not to take the food at (2,6) now, we could move L or R, but then next turn the food's life span decreases to 2. But since moving U is safe and beneficial now, no reason to delay.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **U** is the best immediate action as it safely consumes positive food without any risks.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 48\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 2)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (2, 6)\n   - Body: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)]\n   - So the snake is quite long, with 11 segments.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (\"U\"). This means the last move was from (2,5) to (2,6).\n5. **Food**:\n   - (1, 1): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 4): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,6), moving Up (\"U\") would go to (2,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid (would cause a wall collision).\n\nCurrent direction is Up, so the opposite direction is Down (\"D\"), which is not allowed (no instant reverse). So we can't move Down.\n\nTherefore, possible moves are Left (\"L\") to (1,6) or Right (\"R\") to (3,6).\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Left (\"L\") to (1,6)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=1 is not a wall (only x=0 and x=7 are borders), y=6 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle: (3,2) is not (1,6).\n     - Body: Check if (1,6) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Snake body: [(2,5), (2,4), ..., (5,3)] — (1,6) is not in this list.\n   - Safe to move Left.\n   - Food at (1,6)? No food listed at (1,6).\n   - So moving Left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Move Right (\"R\") to (3,6)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=3 is not a wall, y=6 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle: (3,2) is not (3,6).\n     - Body: Check if (3,6) is in the snake's body.\n       - Snake body doesn't include (3,6).\n   - Safe to move Right.\n   - Food at (3,6)? No food listed at (3,6).\n   - So moving Right is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrent food positions:\n- (1,1): value=5, life=1\n- (5,4): value=8, life=1\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nCan we reach either food this turn?\n\n- From (2,6):\n  - Distance to (1,1): |2-1| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n  - Distance to (5,4): |2-5| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n\nSo we can't eat any food this turn directly.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could cause a collision if eaten?\n\nTail is the last segment: (5,3).\nIs there positive food adjacent to (5,3)?\n\nAdjacent to (5,3):\n- (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4)\nFood at:\n- (5,4): value=8 (positive)\nSo (5,4) is adjacent to the tail.\n\nIf we could move the head to (5,4), it would eat the food, grow by 1, and the tail would stay at (5,3), causing the new tail to be at (5,3), and the head at (5,4), which would not collide immediately. But the tail is at (5,3), and the new tail would be the segment before the current tail, which is (5,2). So head at (5,4) and tail at (5,2) — no collision.\n\nWait, the rule says:\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent to tail is (5,4) with positive food.\n- If head moves to (5,4), it eats the food, snake grows, so the new tail is the segment that was second to last before growth, which is (5,2).\n- Then next turn, head is at (5,4), tail moves from (5,3) to (5,2), but the new tail is already at (5,2), so no collision.\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nOriginal snake: [..., (5,2), (5,3)] — tail is (5,3), segment before is (5,2).\nAfter eating at (5,4), snake becomes [..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)], so new tail is (5,2).\nNext move, tail moves from (5,3) to (5,2), but (5,2) is already the new tail, so head at (5,4) and tail at (5,2) — no overlap unless head moves to (5,2), which is not adjacent to (5,4) unless head moves down, but that's not immediate.\n\nMaybe the danger is if the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail's cell has positive food, meaning the head is next to the tail, and the tail is on food, so eating it would make the head go to tail's position, and the new tail would be where the old tail was, causing head and new tail to be at same position.\n\nIn our case, head is at (2,6), tail at (5,3), not adjacent (distance is |2-5| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6), so not adjacent. So no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nSince both foods will disappear after this turn, and we can't reach them this turn, they're not useful for immediate eating. So our move should be to position ourselves for future food or avoid getting trapped.\n\nCurrent possible moves: Left to (1,6) or Right to (3,6).\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Moving Left to (1,6):\n  - Next moves from (1,6): can go Left to (0,6) (wall), Up to (1,7) (wall), or Down to (1,5).\n  - Down would be opposite of current Up, but current move is Left, so next move can't be Right (opposite of Left), but can be Up or Down.\n  - (1,5): check if in body — (2,5) is in body, but (1,5) is not, so safe.\n- Moving Right to (3,6):\n  - Next moves from (3,6): can go Right to (4,6), Up to (3,7) (wall), or Down to (3,5).\n  - (4,6): not in body.\n  - (3,5): not in body.\n\nBoth moves seem safe for the next step as well.\n\n### Choosing Between Left and Right\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so choose the move that keeps more options open.\n\nLooking at the body:\n- The snake is mostly vertical on the left (x=2 from y=1 to y=6), then goes right at the bottom.\n- Moving Left goes towards the empty left side, which seems less crowded.\n- Moving Right goes towards the center where the snake's body is more spread out, but also closer to the internal obstacle at (3,2).\n\nPerhaps Left is slightly better to avoid getting boxed in by the body later.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Danger\n\n- Left to (1,6):\n  - Next possible moves from (1,6): Down to (1,5) (safe), Left to (0,6) (wall), Up to (1,7) (wall).\n  - So only Down is possible next, but then can go Left to (0,5) (wall), Right to (2,5) (body), Down to (1,4).\n  - So might get trapped soon if we go Left.\n\n- Right to (3,6):\n  - Next moves: Right to (4,6), Down to (3,5).\n  - More options remain open.\n\nGiven that, Right seems better to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering both options, moving Right (\"R\") to (3,6) seems slightly better as it keeps more options open for future moves without immediate risk.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 49  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7).  \n**Walls**:\n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n- Internal Obstacle: (3, 2) is a wall.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (3, 6), followed by body segments in order: \n(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1.

(2, 4): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (3,6) moving Right.\n  - Next segment is (2,6) which is to the left of the head, meaning the snake just moved from (2,6) to (3,6) (i.e., moved Right).\n  - The body then goes down from (2,6) to (2,5), (2,4), etc., forming a vertical line down to (2,1), then moves right to (3,1), (4,1), up to (4,2), and then right to (5,2).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1): Near the bottom-left corner, inside the body's path.\n  - (5,4): Top-right area, not near the current head.\n  - (2,4): On the vertical part of the snake's body.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction immediately. Since the current direction is Right (R), the opposite is Left (L), so L is not allowed next.\n\n**Allowed moves**: U, D, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**:\n   - Current head: (3,6)\n   - Move right: (4,6)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (4,6) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Check if (4,6) is in snake positions. Current body segments are from (2,6) to (5,2). (4,6) is not in the list.\n     - Safe to move right.\n   - Food at (4,6)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Just move without eating.\n\n2. **Up (U)**:\n   - Current head: (3,6)\n   - Move up: (3,7)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall. (3,7) is on the border wall.\n     - Collision with wall.\n   - Outcome: Deadly, cannot move up.\n\n3. **Down (D)**:\n   - Current head: (3,6)\n   - Move down: (3,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is at bottom, (3,5) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Is (3,5) in snake positions? Checking the list: no.\n     - Safe to move down.\n   - Food at (3,5)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Just move without eating.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food items to see if any are reachable or beneficial:\n\n1. **(1,1)**:\n   - Value: 4\n   - Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Position: (1,1)\n   - Current head at (3,6). Distance is large; cannot reach in one move.\n   - Not immediately relevant.\n\n2. **(5,4)**:\n   - Value: 7\n   - Life_span: 1\n   - Position: (5,4)\n   - From (3,6), possible paths:\n     - Right to (4,6), then up to (4,7) - wall.\n     - Right to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (5,5), then down to (5,4) - takes 4 moves, but life_span is 1, so it will disappear before we can reach it.\n   - Cannot reach in time.\n\n3. **(2,4)**:\n   - Value: 10\n   - Life_span: 1\n   - Position: (2,4)\n   - Currently under the snake's body (part of the snake at (2,4)).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (2,4), and the head must move onto (2,4).\n     - Currently, (2,4) is occupied by the snake's body.\n     - Next turn, the tail will move from (5,2) to (?,?), but the segment at (2,4) will move to (2,3) (since the snake moves forward).\n     - So, (2,4) will be free next turn if the head can move there.\n     - To move head to (2,4) next turn, from current (3,6), we'd need to go left to (2,6), but left is opposite of current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n     - Alternatively, if we move down to (3,5), then left to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6), etc. - seems convoluted and not immediate.\n   - Seems impossible to eat (2,4) in the next move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (5,2).\n- Adjacent cells to tail (5,2):\n  - (4,2), (6,2), (5,1), (5,3)\n- Head is at (3,6), not adjacent to tail.\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Right (R): Safe, no food.\n- Down (D): Safe, no food.\n- Up (U): Deadly (wall).\n- Left (L): Not allowed (reverse direction).\n\nBetween R and D:\n- Moving right to (4,6) seems safe.\n- Moving down to (3,5) is also safe.\n- Neither leads to immediate food, but moving right keeps the head moving in the current direction, which might be better for future moves unless we have a reason to turn.\n\nLooking ahead:\n- After moving right to (4,6), next possible moves would be U, D, R (cannot go left).\n  - U to (4,7) - wall.\n  - D to (4,5) - safe.\n  - R to (5,6) - safe.\n- After moving down to (3,5), next possible moves would be L, D, R (cannot go up opposite to down).\n  - L to (2,5) - part of the body at (2,5) will have moved to (2,4), so (2,5) is free next turn.\n  - D to (3,4) - safe.\n  - R to (4,5) - safe.\n\nNeither immediate move leads to food, but moving right seems slightly better as it keeps the head away from the long vertical body part, reducing the chance of getting trapped in the future.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest immediate action is to move **Right (R)**, as it avoids collisions and maintains flexibility for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 50\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and anything on these borders is a wall.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2). This is a single cell that's blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions**:\nThe snake's body is given in order from head to tail:\n1. Head: (4, 6)\n2. Next: (3, 6)\n3. Then: (2, 6)\n4. Then: (2, 5)\n5. Then: (2, 4)\n6. Then: (2, 3)\n7. Then: (2, 2)\n8. Then: (2, 1)\n9. Then: (3, 1)\n10. Then: (4, 1)\n11. Tail: (4, 2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n\n**Food Items**:\nEach food is given as (x, y, life_span, value):\n1. (1, 1, 3, 1) - Positive food at (1,1), life span 3, value +1\n2. (5, 4, 6, 1) - Positive food at (5,4), life span 6, value +1\n3. (2, 4, 9, 1) - Positive food at (2,4), life span 9, value +1\n\nAll foods are positive (+1), none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food locations.\n\n- The head is at (4,6), moving Right (R), so it's facing towards increasing x.\n- The next segment is at (3,6), which is to the left of the head, meaning the snake just moved from (3,6) to (4,6) (i.e., moved Right).\n  \nFood:\n- (1,1): Far bottom-left corner.\n- (5,4): Towards the middle-right.\n- (2,4): On the snake's body! Specifically, the snake has a segment at (2,4), which is the 5th segment from the head.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). But:\n- It cannot reverse its direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move Left (L) next.\n- So possible moves: U, D, R (not L).\n\nNow, let's see where each move would take the head:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (4,6) → (5,6)\n   - Check (5,6):\n     - Walls: x=7 is wall, so x=5 is safe.\n     - Body: Is (5,6) in snake's body? Current body positions are from (3,6) to (4,2). (5,6) is not in the body.\n     - Food: No food at (5,6).\n     - So, safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (4,6) → (4,7)\n   - Check (4,7):\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall. So, this is a wall collision. Deadly.\n   - So, cannot move Up.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (4,6) → (4,5)\n   - Check (4,5):\n     - Walls: y=5 is not a wall.\n     - Body: Is (4,5) in snake's body? No.\n     - Food: No food at (4,5).\n     - So, safe move, no food eaten.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Right (R) and Down (D). Up (U) is deadly, Left (L) is not allowed (reverse).\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten:\n\n1. (1,1,3,1): At (1,1). Currently, the snake's tail is at (4,2). To eat this, the head would need to reach (1,1), which is far and not reachable in one move. So, not immediately relevant.\n\n2. (5,4,6,1): At (5,4). From head at (4,6), how to reach (5,4)?\n   - To go from (4,6) to (5,4), need to move Right then Down twice, but not directly reachable in one move.\n   - So, not immediately reachable.\n\n3. (2,4,9,1): At (2,4). This is interesting because (2,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body (5th segment).\n   - Rule: Food under body can only be eaten if:\n     1. Body moves away (i.e., the segment at (2,4) moves), and\n     2. Head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, the segment at (2,4) is part of the body. The segment before it is (2,5), and after is (2,3).\n   - For (2,4) to move away, the snake must move in a way that the tail moves forward, causing the body to shift.\n   - The tail is at (4,2). The segment before tail is (4,1). So, tail will move based on the head's movement.\n   - To have (2,4) move away, the tail must move such that (2,4) is no longer occupied. This would require the snake to grow or the tail to move past (2,4).\n   - Currently, the snake is long, and unless we eat food, length stays same, and tail moves forward.\n   - So, to eat (2,4), we'd need to have the head move to (2,4) after the body moves away. But currently, (2,4) is occupied by body, so cannot move head there directly.\n   - Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n     - Here, tail is at (4,2). Adjacent cells to tail: (3,2) [obstacle], (5,2), (4,1) [part of snake], (4,3).\n     - Head is at (4,6), not adjacent to tail, so this rule doesn't apply here.\n   - Given that, to eat (2,4), we'd need to maneuver the snake such that the body moves away from (2,4), which isn't straightforward in one move.\n\nGiven this, none of the foods are immediately eatable in the next move.\n\n### Choosing Between R and D\n\nNow, between Right (R) and Down (D), which is better?\n\n1. Right (R) to (5,6):\n   - Next possible moves from (5,6): Current direction would be R.\n     - Cannot move L (reverse), so can move U, D, R.\n     - Moving R to (6,6): Check if (6,6) is safe.\n     - Moving U to (5,7): y=7 is wall, so deadly.\n     - Moving D to (5,5): Safe.\n   - From (5,6), options are R or D next.\n\n2. Down (D) to (4,5):\n   - Current direction becomes D.\n   - Next possible moves: Cannot move U (reverse), so can move L, R, D.\n     - Moving D to (4,4): Safe.\n     - Moving L to (3,5): Safe.\n     - Moving R to (5,5): Safe.\n   - From (4,5), more options next.\n\nBetween the two, moving Down seems to open up more options for future moves, keeping the snake more flexible. Moving Right takes the snake towards the right wall (x=7), which may limit future movements.\n\nAlso, moving Down takes the snake towards the center, where the food at (5,4) is located, potentially setting up a path to reach it in future moves.\n\nMoving Right doesn't seem to offer any immediate advantage and may corner the snake.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Down to (4,5)?\n\n- (4,5) is not a wall, not part of the body, no food there.\n- The only adjacent body parts are:\n  - (3,6) is above, (2,6) is further left, etc.\n  - No body parts adjacent to (4,5) that would cause collision next turn.\n\nSimilarly, moving Right to (5,6) is also safe, but as discussed, may limit future moves.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Moving Down keeps more options open.\n- Moving Right may corner the snake.\n- No immediate food to eat in either move.\n- No immediate dangers in moving Down.\n\n**Best immediate action is to move Down (D).**\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and determine the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 51  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle at (3, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (4,5), followed by body segments in this order: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Down (D)  \nThis means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn (from (4,6) to (4,5)).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1,1): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (5,4): value=5, life_span=1\n3. (2,4): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction immediately. Since the current direction is Down (D), the opposite is Up (U), so U is not allowed next.\n\n**Allowed moves**: D, L, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move based on:\n- Whether the move is into a wall or obstacle.\n- Whether the move causes a body collision (except the tail).\n- Whether the move leads to eating food (considering value and potential risks).\n\n#### Current Snake Body Segments (excluding head at (4,5)):\n- (4,6)\n- (3,6)\n- (2,6)\n- (2,5)\n- (2,4)\n- (2,3)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,1)\n- (3,1)\n- (4,1)\n\n#### Possible Moves from (4,5):\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (4,4)\n   - Check walls: y=4 is not a border wall, and (4,4) is not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check body collision: (4,4) is not in the body segments list.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (3,5)\n   - Walls: x=3 is not a border, and (3,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n   - Body collision: (3,5) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (3,5)? No.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,5)\n   - Walls: x=5 is not a border, and (5,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n   - Body collision: (5,5) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (5,5)? No.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves lead to food directly. But let's look at the food positions and see if we can plan a path to reach them soon.\n\n### Analyzing Food Items\n\n1. **(1,1)**: value=2, life_span=1\n   - At turn 51, life_span=1 means it disappears after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n   - So, it's not available next turn, must eat now if possible.\n   - Current head at (4,5), distance is |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n   - **Cannot eat this turn**.\n\n2. **(5,4)**: value=5, life_span=1\n   - Also disappears after this turn.\n   - Distance: |4-5| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps away.\n   - To reach in one move, need to be adjacent, but current head is at (4,5), adjacent cells:\n     - (4,4), (3,5), (5,5) - none is (5,4).\n   - So, cannot eat this turn.\n\n3. **(2,4)**: value=8, life_span=1\n   - Disappears after this turn.\n   - Distance: |4-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps away.\n   - Adjacent to head: (2,4) is adjacent to (2,5), which is a body segment.\n   - The food is at (2,4), which is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at position 5 in the body list: (2,4)).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (2,4), and the head must move onto (2,4).\n     - Currently, the segment after (2,4) is (2,3), so the tail is moving away from (2,4) as the snake moves.\n     - To have the head move to (2,4), possible moves:\n       - From (4,5), need to go left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then left to (2,4) - but too late.\n       - Or from (4,5), down to (4,4), left to (3,4), left to (2,4) - also too late.\n     - Seems impossible to reach in one move.\n   - **Cannot eat this turn**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Without Eating Food\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn (all have life_span=1 and are too far to reach in one move), we should choose a move that:\n- Is safe (no collision).\n- Keeps options open for future moves.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R\n\n1. **Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - Next turn, from (4,4), possible moves (can't go up to (4,5) - reverse direction):\n     - D: (4,3)\n     - L: (3,4)\n     - R: (5,4)\n   - (5,4) has food now, but it will be gone next turn.\n   - Not much advantage.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - Next turn, from (3,5), can't go right (reverse):\n     - U: (3,6) - but (3,6) is a body segment (second segment), so collision.\n     - D: (3,4)\n     - L: (2,5) - (2,5) is a body segment (4th segment), but it's the tail's previous position. The tail is at (4,1), and the segment before it is (3,1), so (2,5) is not the immediate tail. Wait, let's see:\n       - Current body: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), ..., (4,1)\n       - After moving head to (3,5), tail moves from (4,1) to (3,1), so body becomes:\n         - (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), ..., (3,1)\n       - So (2,5) is still in the body (6th segment), so moving left to (2,5) would collide.\n     - So L is not safe next turn.\n   - So from (3,5), possible safe moves next turn: D to (3,4).\n\n3. **Right (R) to (5,5)**:\n   - Next turn, from (5,5), can't go left (reverse):\n     - U: (5,6) - check walls: y=6 is not border, no obstacle.\n       - Body segments after move: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), ..., (3,1)\n       - (5,6) is not in the body.\n     - D: (5,4) - food is there now, but gone next turn.\n     - R: (6,5) - not a wall, not in body.\n   - More options next turn.\n\nBetween D and R, R seems better as it keeps more options open next turn. L leads to a more constrained position.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Right to (5,5)?\n- Not a wall.\n- Not colliding with body.\n- Not adjacent to tail with positive food (tail is at (4,1), far away).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to (5,5), as it's safe and maintains flexibility for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 52  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and anything on these edges is a wall).\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2) — can't move here.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead is at (5,5), followed by body segments in this order:\n- (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nSo, the snake's body forms a sort of \"L\" shape extending left and then down.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1,1): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (5,4): value=4, life_span=1\n3. (2,4): value=7, life_span=1\n4. (6,3): value=10, life_span=1\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,5) — but this is the opposite of current direction (R), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (5,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a wall, (5,6) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), etc. (5,6) is not in the body list — the closest is (4,6), which is adjacent but not the same.\n  - So, no collision.\n- Food at (5,6)? No, no food there.\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (5,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (5,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (5,4) is in body segments. Looking at the list: (2,4) is at y=4 but x=2, so no.\n  - So, no collision.\n- Food at (5,4)? Yes! There's food with value=4, life_span=1.\n  - Can we eat it? \n    - The food is not under the snake's body (since (5,4) is not in the body list), so yes.\n    - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is the tail cell positive food?\n      - Tail is at (3,1). Head is at (5,5), moving to (5,4). Distance from (5,4) to (3,1) is |5-3| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent means distance=1). So no danger.\n  - So, can eat this food safely.\n  - Eating it: score +4, length +1.\n    - New head: (5,4)\n    - Body: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), ...] — tail (3,1) is removed, but since length increases by 1, tail stays where it was (but actually, the tail moves forward when the head moves, unless we eat food. Wait, no: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by 1.\n    - So new body: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), ..., (3,1)] — same length as before plus one more segment at the head.\n    - But the tail was at (3,1), and now the new tail is the segment before that, which is (2,1). But since length increases by 1, the tail stays at (3,1), and a new segment is added at the head.\n    - So no immediate collision from growth.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (6,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Is (6,5) in body? No.\n  - So, no collision.\n- Food at (6,5)? No, food is at (6,3), not (6,5).\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nNow, let's compare the possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: No food, just move. Safe but no gain.\n2. **Down (D)**: Eat food at (5,4) with value=4. Safe, no tail danger, good gain.\n3. **Right (R)**: No food, just move. Safe but no gain.\n\nBetween U and R, both are safe but don't gain points. D gives +4 points and is safe.\n\nIs there any risk with D? Let's double-check:\n- After eating at (5,4), the new head is at (5,4), body is [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), ... (3,1)].\n- Next move, the tail will be at (2,1), and the segment before that is (2,1)? Wait, the tail is the last segment, which is (3,1). After moving, the tail moves to the previous segment's position, so from (3,1), it moves to where the segment before it was, which is (2,1). But since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the tail stays at (3,1), and the segment before that is (2,1). So no immediate collision.\n- No immediate danger from the move itself.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nAre there other foods we can reach? \n\n- (1,1): Too far, not reachable in one move.\n- (2,4): Currently at (2,4) is a body segment (from the list: (2,4) is part of the snake). So even if we could move there, we can't eat it unless the body moves away first, which it hasn't.\n- (6,3): To reach (6,3) from (5,5), we'd need to move Right to (6,5), then Down to (6,4), then Down to (6,3), but that's two moves away, and the food has life_span=1, so it'll disappear next turn. Can't reach it in time.\n\nSo, only (5,4) is immediately reachable and eatable.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the high-value food at (5,4) safely.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Down (D) to (5,3)\n\n- **Wall Check**: y=3 is within bounds (y=0 to y=7), no wall at (5,3).\n- **Body Collision Check**: \n  - Snake body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1).\n  - (5,3) is not in the body segments → safe.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (5,3).\n  - No immediate reward, but safe move.\n\n#### 2.

Move Right (R) to (6,4)\n\n- **Wall Check**: x=6 is within bounds (x=7 is wall, but x=6 is okay), no wall at (6,4).\n- **Body Collision Check**:\n  - (6,4) is not in the body segments → safe.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (6,4), but there's food at (6,3) which is below (6,4).\n  - Moving right now could set up to go down next turn to (6,3) to eat the food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions:\n\n1. **(2,4)**:\n   - Current head is at (5,4), food is at (2,4).\n   - To reach (2,4), need to move left multiple times, but currently moving down.\n   - Also, (2,4) is occupied by the snake's body (8th segment: (2,4)).\n   - **Special Case**: Food under body can only be eaten if:\n     - Body moves away (tail moves), and head moves onto it.\n   - Currently, the tail is at (3,1). Next move, tail will move to (2,1) (since the snake is moving down, the last segment is removed and new segment added at head).\n   - So, (2,4) will still be occupied by the snake's body after this move (since the segment at (2,4) moves to (2,3), but (2,4) is not the tail).\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n     - Current tail is at (3,1), not adjacent to head (5,4).\n     - Even if we move towards (2,4), it's not the tail's position, so no immediate danger from this rule.\n   - However, to eat (2,4), we'd need to move left multiple times, which isn't immediately feasible without risking collision.\n\n2. **(6,3)**:\n   - Current head at (5,4), food at (6,3).\n   - Path: Right to (6,4), then Down to (6,3).\n   - Next turn, if we move right now to (6,4), then down to (6,3), we can eat the food.\n   - Need to ensure that (6,3) is safe next turn:\n     - After moving right to (6,4), the snake's new positions would be [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), ...].\n     - Then moving down to (6,3):\n       - Not colliding with body (since (6,3) is not in the new body segments).\n       - Not a wall.\n       - Food is there, so eating it is safe (no tail adjacent danger since tail is at (2,1) after first move).\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Down (D) to (5,3)**:\n  - Safe, no immediate reward.\n  - Next moves could be to approach other food, but no clear path to (2,4) soon.\n  \n- **Left (L) to (4,4)**:\n  - Safe, no immediate reward.\n  - Moves away from both foods, not optimal.\n\n- **Right (R) to (6,4)**:\n  - Safe, sets up to eat (6,3) next turn.\n  - Higher potential for immediate score gain.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving right to (6,4) then down to (6,3) to eat food:\n  - Need to ensure that after eating, the snake doesn't trap itself.\n  - After eating, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, but the new tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (6,3), so no collision.\n  \n- Moving towards (2,4):\n  - More complex path, higher risk of collision or getting stuck.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe most promising immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (6,4), setting up to eat the positive food at (6,3) on the next turn. This move is safe and maximizes the chance to increase the score immediately.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the last move was to the right, so the snake cannot instantly reverse to the left on the next move (no U-turns).\n\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (2, 4): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 6\n   - Food at (6, 3): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the positions to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Head at (6, 4)**: Moving right (R), so the previous position was (5, 4).\n  \n- **Adjacent Cells to Head (6, 4)**:\n  - Up (U): (6, 5)\n  - Down (D): (6, 3)\n  - Left (L): (5, 4) — This is the body segment right after the head, so moving left would cause a collision unless the tail moves away.\n  - Right (R): (7, 4) — x=7 is a wall, so moving right would cause a wall collision.\n\nFrom this, moving right is immediately invalid because it's a wall. Moving left is into the body segment (5,4), but let's check if that's safe.\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is R, the possible moves are U, D, or R (but R is into a wall, so invalid). So, we're left with U and D.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6, 5)**:\n   - Check if (6,5) is occupied by body or is a wall:\n     - Body segments: Looking at the snake positions, (6,5) is not in the list.\n     - Walls: y=5 is not a border wall (since y goes up to 7), and there's no internal wall at (6,5).\n   - So, moving up is safe in terms of not colliding with body or walls.\n   - Is there food at (6,5)? No, the foods are at (2,4) and (6,3).\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Check (6,3):\n     - Body segments: Not in the list.\n     - Walls: y=3 is not a border wall.\n     - Food: Yes, there's positive food at (6,3) with value 1.\n   - So, moving down would eat the food at (6,3).\n   - Need to check if eating this food causes any immediate danger:\n     - Eating increases length by 1, so the new tail would be where the current tail is after moving: current tail is at (2,1). After moving down, the tail moves forward, so the new tail would be at (2,2).\n     - Is the head adjacent to the new tail after eating? New head at (6,3), new tail at (2,2). They are not adjacent (distance is |6-2| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5), so no danger from tail reward.\n     - Also, no immediate collision with the new body segment.\n\n3. **Move Left (L) to (5, 4)**:\n   - (5,4) is the first body segment right after the head.\n   - Normally, moving into the body is deadly, but there's an exception if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n   - Current tail is at (2,1). The segment at (5,4) is not the tail, so moving left would collide with the body — deadly.\n   - Hence, moving left is invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Food at (2,4)\n\nThere's also food at (2,4), which is currently under the snake's body (since (2,4) is part of the body segments). \n\n- To eat this food:\n  - The body must move away from (2,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is at (6,4), so it's not adjacent to (2,4), meaning we can't reach it in one move.\n  - So, we cannot eat (2,4) this turn.\n\n### Deciding Between U and D\n\nBetween moving Up to (6,5) and Down to (6,3):\n\n- Moving Down eats the positive food at (6,3), increasing the score and length.\n- Moving Up doesn't eat any food but is safe.\n\nIs there any risk in moving Down to eat the food?\n\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail is at (2,2), and the head is at (6,3).\n- Next possible moves from (6,3):\n  - Current direction would be D (since we moved down).\n  - Possible next moves: L, R, or U (cannot move D again to reverse).\n  - Need to ensure that after eating, the next moves are safe, but since we're only deciding the immediate action, this is acceptable.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Eating\n\nAfter moving to (6,3):\n\n- New snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), ..., (2,1)] with an additional segment at the end (since length increases by 1).\n- The new tail is at (2,2), which is not adjacent to (6,3), so no tail reward danger.\n- No immediate collisions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Down (D) to (6,3) is the best immediate action because:\n\n1. It eats a positive food (+1 score, +1 length).\n2. It's safe — no collisions with walls or body.\n3. No tail reward danger after eating.\n4. The other options:\n   - Right (R) is into a wall — invalid.\n   - Left (L) is into the body — deadly.\n   - Up (U) is safe but doesn't gain any points.\n\nTherefore, the optimal immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(6,2) is not in this list.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (6, 2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2.

(5,3) is not in the body.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (5, 3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7, 3)\n- **Position**: (7, 3)\n- **Check Walls**:\n  - x=7 is a border wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Moving right would hit the wall → deadly collision. **Invalid move**.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a risk.\n\n1. **Food at (2, 4)**:\n   - Current position: head at (6, 3).\n   - Distance: Need to move left and up to reach (2,4).\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (2,1). The food is at (2,4), which is part of the snake's body (specifically, the 10th segment: (2,4)).\n     - To eat this, the head would need to move to (2,4) when the body moves away.\n     - Currently, the segment after (2,4) is (2,3), so moving to (2,4) would mean the head is at (2,4) and the new tail would be at (2,3), which is adjacent → collision.\n     - **Dangerous**: Eating this food would cause the head to collide with the new tail.\n\n2. **Food at (3, 4)**:\n   - Current position: head at (6, 3).\n   - Distance: Need to move left and up.\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n   - Not currently under the snake's body (snake body at y=4 is (6,4), (5,4), then (2,4)).\n   - No immediate danger or opportunity.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible safe moves:\n- Down (D) to (6, 2): safe, no reward.\n- Left (L) to (5, 3): safe, no reward.\n\nBoth are safe, but which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- After moving Down to (6,2), next moves could be Left to (5,2) or Right to (7,2) (but Right is wall), or continue Down to (6,1) (but y=1 is next to wall y=0).\n- After moving Left to (5,3), next moves could be Down to (5,2), Left to (4,3), or Up to (5,4) (but Up is opposite of current D, so not allowed unless we change direction now).\n\nMoving Left seems slightly better as it keeps more options open for future moves towards the food at (3,4).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe safest and most strategic immediate action is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However, due to movement constraints:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n  \nSo, possible moves are: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (4 - 1, 3) = (3, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: (3, 3) is not a wall (border walls are at x=0,7; y=0,7; internal obstacle at (3,2)).\n  - **Body**: The body segments are at positions starting from (5,3) onwards. (3,3) is not in the body list.\n- **Food**: No food at (3,3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (4, 3 + 1) = (4, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: (4,4) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (4,4) is in body segments. Current body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). (4,4) is not in the list.\n- **Food**: \n  - No food at (4,4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (4, 3 - 1) = (4, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: (4,2) is not a border wall, but there's an internal obstacle at (3,2). (4,2) is not (3,2), so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: Check if (4,2) is in body segments. It's not.\n- **Food**: No food at (4,2).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nCurrently, there are two food items:\n\n1. **Food at (2,4)**:\n   - Current position: (4,3).\n   - To reach (2,4):\n     - Path: From (4,3), need to go Left to (3,3), then Left to (2,3), then Up to (2,4).\n     - But the food is at (2,4), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (second last segment).\n     - According to rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n       1. The body moves away.\n       2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n     - Currently, the tail is at (2,3), which will move to (2,4) if the snake moves in a way that the tail advances. However, the food is at (2,4), so if the tail moves to (2,4), the food will be under the tail, not the head.\n     - To eat this, the head would need to reach (2,4) after the tail moves away. But given the snake's length and positions, this seems complex and risky, especially considering the \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n     - Given the complexity and high risk, it's better to avoid this food for now.\n\n2. **Food at (3,4)**:\n   - Current position: (4,3).\n   - To reach (3,4):\n     - Path: From (4,3), can go Up to (4,4), then Left to (3,4).\n     - Or Left to (3,3), then Up to (3,4).\n   - The food is not under the snake's body, so can be eaten directly when the head moves onto it.\n   - Life span is 8 turns, so no urgency.\n   - Currently, moving Left to (3,3) is safe, then next turn can go Up to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\n### Choosing the Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven the above, the immediate options are U, D, L, with R being invalid.\n\n- **Move Left (L)**:\n  - Safe.\n  - Moves towards the food at (3,4) (can reach it in two steps: L then U).\n- **Move Up (U)**:\n  - Safe.\n  - Moves to (4,4), which is away from both foods.\n- **Move Down (D)**:\n  - Safe.\n  - Moves to (4,2), which is away from both foods.\n\nThe most strategic move seems to be **Left (L)**, as it positions the snake to potentially eat the food at (3,4) in the next move without immediate risk.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that moving Left doesn't lead to a Tail Reward Danger scenario in the next steps.\n\n- After moving Left to (3,3), the snake's new positions will be:\n  - Head: (3,3)\n  - Body: (4,3), (5,3), ..., (2,3)\n- Tail is at (2,3).\n- Next move could be Up to (3,4) to eat the food at (3,4).\n  - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move, and the new tail is the old tail (2,3).\n  - New head is at (3,4), body extends to (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n  - The tail is at (2,3), which is adjacent to (3,3) (part of the body), not directly to the head (3,4), so no immediate collision.\n  - No Tail Reward Danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and most strategic immediate move is **Left (L)**, positioning the snake to potentially eat the positive food at (3,4) in the next turn without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so the opposite direction (Right, R) is not allowed in the next move to prevent instant reverse.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (2, 4): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - (3, 4): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 5): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (3, 3)\n\nFrom the head at (3, 3), the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (3, 4)\n- Down (D): (3, 2)\n- Left (L): (2, 3)\n- Right (R): (4, 3)\n\nBut we must consider:\n- Current direction is Left (L), so we cannot move Right (R) next (instant reverse).\n- Walls and obstacles:\n  - Down to (3, 2): There's an internal obstacle at (3, 2), so this is invalid.\n- Body collisions:\n  - Left to (2, 3): Check if (2, 3) is in the snake's body. Current body positions are from (4,3) onwards, so (2,3) is safe.\n  - Up to (3, 4): Check if (3, 4) is in the body. Looking at the positions, (3, 4) is not listed, so it's safe.\n  \nSo, valid moves are U, L.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLet's look at the food positions relative to the head:\n\n1. (2, 4): value = 2\n   - Distance from head (3,3): Manhattan distance = |3-2| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - To reach (2,4), one possible path: Left to (2,3), then Up to (2,4).\n   - But we can't plan paths; we need immediate action. Currently, moving Left to (2,3) doesn't directly eat food, but sets up for next move.\n\n2. (3, 4): value = 7\n   - Directly above the head at (3,3). Moving Up to (3,4) eats this food immediately.\n   - High value (7), but need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - The tail is at (2,4). After moving Up to (3,4), the tail moves forward (since the snake grows by 1 when eating positive food).\n     - The new tail would be the last segment before the current tail, which is (2,5).\n     - So, after eating, the head is at (3,4), new tail at (2,5), no immediate collision.\n     - However, the food at (2,4) is under the tail. If we eat (3,4), the tail moves from (2,4) to (2,5), so no issue with tail reward danger here.\n\n3. (5, 5): value = 10\n   - Far from the head, not reachable immediately.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nMoving Up to (3,4) eats the high-value food (7) there. This seems optimal because:\n- It's the highest value food reachable in one move.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- No tail reward danger in this scenario.\n\nMoving Left to (2,3) doesn't eat any food immediately and sets up for eating (2,4) next turn, but that food has lower value (2) compared to (3,4)'s 7.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Up\n\nAfter moving Up to (3,4):\n- New head: (3,4)\n- Snake grows by 1 (since food is positive), so new body:\n  - Add (3,4) to front, rest segments shift: \n    - New body: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), ..., (2,4)]\n  - Tail was at (2,4), now moves to (2,5) (since the segment before tail was (2,5)).\n- Check if new head (3,4) collides with any body segment:\n  - Next segment is (3,3), which is not the same as (3,4).\n  - Other segments are further away.\n- No wall or obstacle at (3,4).\n\n### Considering Food Lifespan\n\nAll foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So, we should prioritize eating the highest value food available now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two valid moves (U and L), moving Up to (3,4) allows us to eat the high-value food (7) immediately without any immediate risks. Moving Left doesn't provide immediate food and the food it sets up for is of lower value.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Up (U) to (3, 5)\n\n- **Position Check**:\n  - (3, 5): Is this a wall or part of the snake's body?\n    - Walls: Check if x=0/7 or y=0/7 → No.\n      - Internal obstacle: (3, 2) → Not here.\n    - Snake body: Check if (3, 5) is in the body segments.\n      - Current body: (3, 3), (4, 3), ..., (2, 4) → (3, 5) is not in the list.\n  - **Safe to move here**.\n\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food is listed at (3, 5).\n  - So, no immediate reward, just moving to an empty cell.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (2, 4)\n\n- **Position Check**:\n  - (2, 4):\n    - Walls: Not a border wall, not (3, 2).\n    - Snake body: The tail is at (2, 4). \n      - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we must check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n        - If the tail has positive food and we eat it, the snake grows, and the new tail would be where the old tail was, causing a collision.\n      - Here, (2, 4) has food with value=1 (positive).\n      - Eating it would grow the snake, making the new tail stay at (2, 4), but the head is now at (2, 4), causing a collision.\n      - **This is dangerous!** Eating this food would kill the snake.\n  - **Not safe to eat this food**.\n\n- **Alternative Consideration**:\n  - Can we move to (2, 4) without eating the food? \n    - No, if the head moves onto a food cell, it will eat it unless the food is under the body (which it isn't here).\n\n- **Conclusion**: Moving left is unsafe because it leads to eating positive food at the tail, causing a collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (4, 4)\n\n- **Position Check**:\n  - (4, 4):\n    - Walls: Not a border or internal wall.\n    - Snake body: Check if (4, 4) is in the body segments.\n      - Current body: (3, 3), (4, 3), ..., (2, 4) → (4, 4) is not in the list.\n  - **Safe to move here**.\n\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food is listed at (4, 4).\n  - Just moving to an empty cell.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nWe have two safe moves: Up (U) to (3, 5) and Right (R) to (4, 4). Both lead to empty cells with no immediate reward.\n\nIs there any other consideration?\n\n- **Food Life Span**: Both foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n  - (2, 4): Value=1, but eating it is dangerous as established.\n  - (5, 5): Value=9, but it's at (5, 5). Can we reach it next turn?\n    - From (3, 4), moving right to (4, 4), then next turn could potentially move towards (5, 5), but it's two steps away.\n    - From (3, 4), moving up to (3, 5), then next turn could move right to (4, 5), then next to (5, 5), but the food will be gone by then.\n  - So, we cannot reach (5, 5) in this turn to eat it.\n\n- **Future Paths**:\n  - Moving Up (U) to (3, 5):\n    - Next moves could be U to (3, 6), but (3, 6) is part of the body.\n    - Or L to (2, 5), which is safe.\n    - Or R to (4, 5), which is part of the body.\n  - Moving Right (R) to (4, 4):\n    - Next moves could be U to (4, 5), which is body.\n    - Or R to (5, 4), which is body.\n    - Or D to (4, 3), which is body.\n    - Seems like moving right leads to more body constraints next turn.\n\nGiven that, moving Up seems slightly better as it leaves more options next turn (can move left to (2, 5)).\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (U and R), moving Up seems marginally better for future flexibility. Moving Left is dangerous, and moving Right may corner us more next turn.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 60 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move beyond these coordinates.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n  - Head is at (3,5).\n  - Tail is at (2,5).\n- Current direction: U (Up, which is (x, y+1)).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Only one food item: (5, 5, 9, 1)\n  - Position: (5,5)\n  - Value: 9 (positive food, so eating it gives +1 score and increases length by 1)\n  - Life span: 1 (it will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5) and direction U, the possible moves are U, L, R (can't go D because that's the opposite of current direction U, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's explore each:\n\n1. **Up (U): (3,5) → (3,6)**\n   - Check (3,6): It's part of the snake's body (from the positions list: (4,6), (3,6), ...). So, moving here would collide with the body → deadly.\n   \n2. **Left (L): (3,5) → (2,5)**\n   - Check (2,5): It's the tail of the snake. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - Is there positive food at the tail? The tail is at (2,5); no food is listed there (only food is at (5,5)). So no danger here.\n     - Also, is (2,5) a wall? No, walls are at borders x=0/x=7/y=0/y=7 and (3,2). (2,5) is safe.\n     - So, moving left is safe.\n\n3. **Right (R): (3,5) → (4,5)**\n   - Check (4,5): It's part of the snake's body (from positions: ..., (5,5), (4,5), ...). So, moving here would collide with the body → deadly.\n\nSo, the only safe move is Left (L).\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThere's positive food at (5,5) with life span 1 (will disappear after this turn). Can we eat it?\n\nCurrent head is at (3,5). To reach (5,5):\n- Need to move right twice: first to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n  - But (4,5) is part of the body → can't move there directly.\n- Alternatively, go down then right, but current direction is U, can't go D directly.\n- Other paths would take more turns, but food disappears after this turn.\n\nSo, it's impossible to reach the food this turn. Hence, we don't need to consider it for the immediate move.\n\n### Decision\n\nOnly safe move is Left (L). \n\n- Moving Left to (2,5) is safe (tail moves away, no collision).\n- Other moves lead to collisions.\n- Can't reach the food in one move.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough: if we move left to (2,5), the tail is currently at (2,5). After moving:\n- Head moves to (2,5).\n- Tail was at (2,5), and since we're eating nothing (no food at (2,5)), the tail moves to the next segment, which is (2,6) becomes the new tail.\n- No collision occurs because the head moves to where the tail was, but the tail moves away at the same time.\n- No food is at the tail, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 61  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (2, 5), followed by:\n- (3, 5)\n- (3, 4)\n- (3, 3)\n- (4, 3)\n- (5, 3)\n- (6, 3)\n- (6, 4)\n- (5, 4)\n- (5, 5)\n- (4, 5)\n- (4, 6)\n- (3, 6)\n- (2, 6)\n\nSo, the snake's body is quite long, wrapping around the grid.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so it can't instantly reverse to right in the next move.\n\n**Food**:\n1.

(5, 6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\nBoth foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (2, 5), moving left (L) is the current direction. The possible moves are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (1, 5)\n- **Up (U)**: (2, 6)\n- **Down (D)**: (2, 4)\n\nCannot move right (R) because that's the opposite of the current direction (L), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Left (L) to (1, 5)\n- Check if (1, 5) is a wall: x=1 is not a border wall, and there's no internal obstacle at (1,5). So, it's free.\n- Check if (1, 5) is part of the snake's body:\n  - Snake body segments: from (3,5) to (2,6). (1,5) is not in this list. So, safe.\n- No food at (1,5), so no score change.\n- After moving left, the new head is at (1,5), and the tail moves forward, so the last segment (2,6) is removed.\n\n#### 2. Up (U) to (2, 6)\n- Check (2,6):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Is it part of the snake's body? Yes, the tail is at (2,6). \n    - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we have to check if there's food at the tail that could cause a collision after growing.\n    - There's no food listed at (2,6), so it's safe to move here.\n    - However, looking back at the snake positions, the segment before the tail is (3,6), so the tail is at (2,6). Moving to (2,6) would make the head overlap with the tail's current position, but since the tail moves away (from (2,6) to where (3,6) was), this is safe unless there's food at (2,6) that would make the tail stay (but there isn't).\n    - Wait, the food positions are at (5,5) and (5,6), not at (2,6), so no danger from tail reward.\n- No food at (2,6), so no score change.\n\n#### 3. Down (D) to (2, 4)\n- Check (2,4):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not part of the snake's body (body goes down to (3,3), etc., not (2,4)).\n  - No food at (2,4), so no score change.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nBoth foods have life_span = 1, so they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\n1. (5,5): value = 8\n   - To eat this, the head needs to move to (5,5).\n   - Current head is at (2,5). To reach (5,5), need to move right, but current direction is left, and we can't instantly reverse to right. So, cannot eat (5,5) this turn.\n\n2. (5,6): value = 10\n   - To eat this, head needs to move to (5,6).\n   - From (2,5), how to reach (5,6)?\n     - Need to move right (but can't this turn), then up, etc. Not possible in one move.\n   - So, cannot eat (5,6) this turn either.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving left to (1,5): safe, no immediate risks.\n- Moving up to (2,6): safe, as tail moves away and no food there.\n- Moving down to (2,4): safe, no immediate risks.\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, the primary goal is to stay alive and position ourselves for future moves.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body. \n\n- Left (L): moves towards the left border, but not immediately hitting it.\n- Up (U): moves towards the tail's current position, but since the tail moves away, it's safe.\n- Down (D): moves towards the lower part of the grid.\n\nGiven that the snake is quite long and wrapped around, moving down might open up more space for future moves, but it's hard to say without seeing future states.\n\nMoving up to (2,6) is also safe and might help in positioning for future food collection, but since we can't eat anything now, it's a neutral move.\n\nMoving left to (1,5) is also safe and keeps the snake moving in its current direction, which might be preferable unless we have a reason to change.\n\nGiven that both up and left are safe, and down is safe but might not offer any immediate advantage, I'd lean towards continuing left unless there's a reason to change direction.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving left to (1,5) seems safe and doesn't immediately box us in.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nAfter moving left to (1,5), next turn the head is at (1,5), direction is L. Possible moves then would be L (to (0,5) - wall), U (to (1,6)), D (to (1,4)).\n\n- (0,5): wall, can't go.\n- (1,6): check if it's safe.\n- (1,4): safe unless part of body.\n\nFrom current body, after moving left, the tail moves away from (2,6), so body is from (2,5) onwards. (1,6) is not in the body, (1,4) is not in the body, so both would be safe next turn.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,6) now would make next head at (2,6), direction U. Then possible moves U (to (2,7) - wall), L (to (1,6)), R (can't, opposite of U is D, but current is U, so R is allowed? Wait, no, current is L, now moving U, so next can't be D. So can go L or R or U.\n\nWait, current direction is L, moving U changes direction to U, so next can't be D (opposite of U). So can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,7) - wall.\nL to (1,6) - ?\nR to (3,6) - part of body (current body has (3,6)).\n\nSo next would be L to (1,6), which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (2,4) now would make next head at (2,4), direction D. Then can't go U, so can go D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,3) - ?\nL to (1,4) - ?\nR to (3,4) - part of body (current has (3,4)).\n\nSo next would be D or L.\n\nAll seem to have safe follow-ups, so no immediate danger in any choice.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince all moves are safe and we can't eat food this turn, the choice is somewhat neutral. Continuing left seems reasonable to keep the snake moving in its current direction without unnecessary turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

From the rules, we cannot make an instant reverse, so we cannot move Right (opposite of Left). Therefore, possible moves are:\n- Up (U)\n- Down (D)\n- Left (L)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (0, 5)\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a border wall. Cannot move here. **Invalid**.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (1, 6)\n   - Check for walls: y=6 is not a wall (border is at y=7).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - The snake's body segments are all other positions except head.\n     - (1, 6) is not in the body segments. **Valid**.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (1, 6). So, just move without eating.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (1, 4)\n   - Check for walls: y=4 is not a wall (border is at y=0).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (1, 4) is not in the body segments. **Valid**.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (1, 4). Just move.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nBoth foods are at:\n- (5, 5): value = +7 (positive)\n- (5, 6): value = +9 (positive)\n\nBut they're both at life_span = 1, so they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nHowever, the snake's head is at (1, 5), and the foods are at (5,5) and (5,6), which are quite far. It's impossible to reach them in one move, so we can't eat them this turn regardless.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if the head is adjacent to the tail and if the tail cell has positive food that could cause a collision if eaten.\n\n- Tail is the last segment: (3, 6).\n- Adjacent cells to head (1,5):\n   - Left: (0,5) - wall\n   - Right: (2,5) - body segment\n   - Up: (1,6) - empty\n   - Down: (1,4) - empty\n- The tail is at (3,6), which is not adjacent to the head (distance is more than 1). So, no immediate danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nBetween Up and Down:\n- Moving Up to (1,6):\n   - Next possible moves from (1,6), direction U:\n     - Can't reverse to D.\n     - Possible: U (to (1,7) - but y=7 is a wall), L (to (0,6) - wall), R (to (2,6) - need to check if free).\n   - Moving to (1,6) seems safe but doesn't lead directly to food.\n   \n- Moving Down to (1,4):\n   - Next possible moves from (1,4), direction D:\n     - Can't reverse to U.\n     - Possible: D (to (1,3)), L (to (0,4) - wall), R (to (2,4)).\n   - (1,3) is part of the body (from snake positions: ..., (3,3), (4,3), ... but not (1,3)), so D to (1,3) is safe.\n   - This might give more options in the next move.\n\nBoth moves seem safe, but neither can reach food this turn. Moving Down might keep more options open for future moves towards the center where foods are.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving Down to (1,4) seems fine, and then possibly moving Right towards the food in future turns.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up to (1,6) also seems safe, but then we're moving away from the foods at (5,5) and (5,6).\n\nGiven that foods are at (5,5) and (5,6), and the snake's body is mostly on the left and lower side, moving Down might be slightly better to eventually loop around towards the food.\n\nBut since both moves are safe and neither can reach food this turn, either is acceptable. \n\nGiven that the foods will disappear after this turn (life_span=1), and we can't reach them, it doesn't matter which we choose for food. \n\nLooking at the body positions, moving Down to (1,4) seems slightly better because it's moving towards the center where more food might spawn, whereas moving Up to (1,6) is moving towards the top where there's less space.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest move is **Down (D)** to (1,4).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what the constraints are.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is bounded by walls at `x=0`, `x=7`, `y=0`, and `y=7`. This means the playable area is from `(1,1)` to `(6,6)`.\n   - There's an internal obstacle at `(3, 2)`, which the snake cannot pass through.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail:\n     - Head: `(1, 4)`\n     - Body segments: `(1, 5)`, `(2, 5)`, `(3, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, `(4, 3)`, `(5, 3)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 4)`, `(5, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(4, 5)`, `(4, 6)`\n   - The snake's current direction is `D` (Down), meaning it was moving downward in the previous turn.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - `(5, 5)`: Value = `6`, Life span = `1`\n     - `(5, 6)`: Value = `8`, Life span = `1`\n   - Both foods have a life span of `1`, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations.\n\n- **Snake's Head**: `(1, 4)`\n- **Adjacent Cells to Head**:\n  - Up (`U`): `(1, 5)` - This is the first body segment; moving here would cause a collision.\n  - Down (`D`): `(1, 3)` - Currently empty (assuming no walls here; walls are at `y=0`, so `y=3` is safe).\n  - Left (`L`): `(0, 4)` - This is a wall (`x=0`), so invalid.\n  - Right (`R`): `(2, 4)` - Currently empty.\n\nGiven the current direction is `D`, the opposite direction is `U`, which is invalid (would cause a collision), so we cannot reverse.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nFrom `(1, 4)` with direction `D`, possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (`D`)**: `(1, 3)`\n   - Check if `(1, 3)` is safe:\n     - Not a wall: `y=3` is not a border wall (`y=0` is the border).\n     - Not occupied by body: Looking at the snake's body segments, `(1, 3)` is not listed.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: The only internal obstacle is `(3, 2)`.\n   - Safe to move here.\n\n2. **Turn Left (`L`)**: `(0, 4)`\n   - This is a wall (`x=0`), so invalid.\n\n3. **Turn Right (`R`)**: `(2, 4)`\n   - Check if `(2, 4)` is safe:\n     - Not a wall: `x=2` is within bounds.\n     - Not occupied by body: `(2, 4)` is not in the snake's body segments.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n   - Safe to move here.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are `D` and `R`.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to decide which move might be beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at `(5, 5)`**:\n   - Value: `6`\n   - Life span: `1` (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current distance from head `(1, 4)`:\n     - Manhattan distance: `|5-1| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5`\n   - Cannot reach this food in one move; it's too far.\n\n2. **Food at `(5, 6)`**:\n   - Value: `8`\n   - Life span: `1`\n   - Distance from head `(1, 4)`:\n     - `|5-1| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6`\n   - Also cannot reach this food in one move.\n\nSince neither food can be reached in the immediate next move, the primary goal is to move safely without colliding, possibly positioning the snake to reach food in future turns.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- The tail is at `(4, 6)`.\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n  - Adjacent means sharing a side (Manhattan distance = 1).\n  - Distance from `(1, 4)` to `(4, 6)`: `|4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5` > 1, so not adjacent.\n- Therefore, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nWhile we can't reach food immediately, let's see which move might set us up better for future food collection.\n\n1. **Move Down (`D`) to `(1, 3)`**:\n   - From `(1, 3)`, possible next moves:\n     - `D`: `(1, 2)` - towards the bottom.\n     - `L`: `(0, 3)` - wall.\n     - `R`: `(2, 3)` - towards the center.\n   - This moves the snake away from the current food positions but keeps it safe.\n\n2. **Move Right (`R`) to `(2, 4)`**:\n   - From `(2, 4)`, possible next moves:\n     - `U`: `(2, 5)` - part of the body (`(2, 5)` is the third segment).\n     - `D`: `(2, 3)` - safe.\n     - `L`: `(1, 4)` - previous head position, but since the tail moves, this might be safe unless the tail is there next turn.\n     - `R`: `(3, 4)` - part of the body (`(3, 4)` is the fifth segment).\n   - Only `D` is immediately safe next move, which could lead towards the food at `(5, 5)` or `(5, 6)` in subsequent moves.\n\nBetween `D` and `R`, moving `R` seems slightly better as it moves the snake towards the center where the foods are located, even if not immediately reachable.\n\n### Checking Immediate Safety of `R`\n\nBefore deciding, let's ensure that moving `R` to `(2, 4)` is safe in terms of future moves:\n\n- After moving to `(2, 4)`, the new head is `(2, 4)`, and the tail moves forward, so the new tail is `(4, 5)` (since the current tail is `(4, 6)` and the segment before is `(4, 5)`).\n- Next possible moves from `(2, 4)`:\n   - `D` to `(2, 3)`:\n     - Not a wall, not in body (current body after move would be `[(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (4,5)]` - `(2,3)` is not in this list).\n   - Other directions lead to body or walls as noted above.\n\nSo, moving `R` now allows a safe `D` next move towards the food.\n\n### Considering Food Under Body\n\nThere's a rule that food can be under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- `(5, 5)` is currently under the snake's body (it's the 12th segment: `(5, 5)`).\n- `(5, 6)` is not under the snake's body.\n\nTo eat `(5, 5)`:\n- The body must move away from `(5, 5)`, meaning the tail must have moved past it.\n- Then, the head must move onto `(5, 5)`.\nGiven the current length, it would take several moves to free `(5, 5)`, and with life span `1`, it's impossible this turn.\n\nSimilarly for `(5, 6)`, it's not under the body, but we can't reach it this turn.\n\n### Decision Between `D` and `R`\n\nGiven that:\n- Both moves are safe immediately.\n- `R` moves towards the center where foods are, allowing potential future access.\n- `D` moves towards the edge, which might limit future options.\n\n**Choosing `R` seems more strategic** as it positions the snake better for future food collection, even if no food is eaten this turn.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Can Be Eaten\n\nJust to confirm, is there any food that can be eaten this turn by moving onto it?\n\n- The head is at `(1, 4)`.\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - `(1, 5)` - body, cannot move there.\n  - `(1, 3)` - no food.\n  - `(0, 4)` - wall.\n  - `(2, 4)` - no food.\n  \nNo adjacent food to eat this turn, so the choice is purely about safe movement and positioning.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic move is to go `R` (Right) to `(2, 4)`.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(1,3) is not in the list, so safe.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (1,3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R) to (3, 3)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - Is (3,3) a wall? No.\n  - Is (3,3) occupied by the snake's body? Looking at snake positions, (3,3) is the 8th segment (from head). But since the tail is at (4,5), moving to (3,3) would mean the head moves where the body is currently, but the body will also move forward, so this is actually safe because the tail will move away.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (3,3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2, 2)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - Is (2,2) a wall? No.\n  - Is (2,2) an internal obstacle? The only internal obstacle is at (3,2), so safe.\n  - Is (2,2) occupied by the snake's body? Checking the positions, (2,2) is not in the list, so safe.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (2,2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable in the next move or if we should plan to reach them:\n\n1. **Food at (5,5)**:\n   - Current head at (2,3). Distance is |5-2| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps away.\n   - Life_span = 1, so it will disappear after this turn.

Is there positive food at (4,5)? \n  - Food is at (5,5) and (5,6), not at (4,5), so no danger here.\n\n### Optimal Move Selection\n\nAll three possible moves (L, R, D) are safe with no immediate reward. Now, we should consider which move might set us up better for future food collection or avoid potential traps.\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (1,3)**:\n  - From (1,3), next possible moves would be L (to (0,3) — wall), D (to (1,2)), or U (to (1,4)).\n  - (1,4) is part of the snake's body, so moving U would collide unless the body moves away, but it's risky.\n  \n- **Move Right (R) to (3,3)**:\n  - From (3,3), next moves could be R (to (4,3)), D (to (3,2) — obstacle), or U (to (3,4)).\n  - (4,3) is part of the snake's body (9th segment), but since the tail is at (4,5), it might be safe if the body moves away.\n  - (3,4) is also part of the snake's body (7th segment), so moving U could be risky.\n  \n- **Move Down (D) to (2,2)**:\n  - From (2,2), next moves could be L (to (1,2)), R (to (3,2) — obstacle), or D (to (2,1)).\n  - Both L and D seem safe, with no immediate body parts there.\n\nGiven that moving Down seems to open up more safe options next turn without immediate body collision risks, it might be the best choice among the three.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- Moving Down to (2,2):\n  - Next possible moves: L to (1,2), D to (2,1), or R to (3,2) (obstacle).\n  - Both (1,2) and (2,1) are safe based on current snake positions.\n  \nOther moves seem to lead to potential body collisions in the next steps, making Down the safest for now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Down (D)** seems the safest with the most open options for the next move.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

No.\n   - **Valid Move**.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (3,2)\n   - Check walls: x=3 is not a border.\n   - Check obstacles: (3,2) is an obstacle.\n   - **Invalid Move** (hits obstacle).\n\n4. **Up (U)**: (2,3)\n   - Instant reverse from Down to Up is not allowed.\n   - **Invalid Move**.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are **Down (D)** and **Left (L)**.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two valid moves based on the food positions and potential risks.\n\n#### Option 1: Move Down (D) to (2,1)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2,1)\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (2,1).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moves the snake away from the current body.\n  - Next moves from (2,1) would be constrained by the body's new position after this move.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Left (L) to (1,2)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (1,2)\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (1,2).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moves towards the left side of the grid.\n  - From (1,2), possible next moves would be Left (L) to (0,2) (border, invalid), Down (D) to (1,1), or Up (U) to (1,3).\n  - Moving Left now might limit future options as it's near the border.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nBoth foods are at (5,5) and (5,6), which are currently occupied by the snake's body:\n- (5,5) is the tail segment.\n- (5,6) is not occupied by the snake (since the snake's positions are up to (5,5)).\n\n**Food at (5,5)**:\n- Currently under the tail.\n- To eat this, the tail must move away, and the head must move onto (5,5).\n- Currently, the head is at (2,2), which is far from (5,5).\n- Eating this food would require the head to reach (5,5) when the tail is not there, but since the tail is at (5,5), moving onto it would mean the tail moves away, and the head moves in, growing the snake. However, the new tail would be at (5,5), and the head at (5,5) would collide with the new tail (since the snake grows by 1, the new tail is where the old tail was).\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Eating food under the tail is deadly if the head is adjacent to the tail. Currently, the head is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1), but if we maneuver to eat (5,5), it would be dangerous when adjacent.\n- Given the distance, it's not immediately relevant for this move.\n\n**Food at (5,6)**:\n- Not under the snake.\n- To eat this, the head needs to move to (5,6).\n- Currently at (2,2), it's several moves away.\n- Not immediately relevant for this move.\n\n### Immediate Safety and Future Options\n\nBetween moving Down (D) to (2,1) and Left (L) to (1,2):\n- Moving Down keeps more options open as it moves towards the center.\n- Moving Left moves towards the border, potentially limiting future moves.\n\nNeither move immediately leads to food, but Down seems safer for maintaining maneuverability.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Opportunities\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten in the next few moves?\n- The closest food is at (5,5) and (5,6), both several moves away.\n- No immediate food is reachable in one move from (2,2).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving Left to (1,2) is safe now but may lead to being boxed in near the border.\n- Moving Down to (2,1) is safe and keeps more options open.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Both moves are safe immediately.\n- Moving Down maintains better future mobility.\n- No immediate food is accessible in one move.\n\n**Best immediate action is to move Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n**Snake Position**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head:\n- Head: (2, 1)\n- Body segments: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)\n- Tail: (5, 4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving **Down (D)**, which means its last move was from (2, 2) to (2, 1) (since moving down decreases the y-coordinate).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5, 5): value = 2, life_span = 1\n2. (5, 6): value = 4, life_span = 1\n3. (4, 6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nFrom the head at (2, 1), moving Down (D), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1, 1)\n- **Right (R)**: (3, 1)\n- **Down (D)**: (2, 0) — but y=0 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n- **Up (U)**: (2, 2) — but this is the opposite of the current direction (D), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are **Left (L)** to (1, 1) or **Right (R)** to (3, 1).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Option 1: Left (L) to (1, 1)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Is (1, 1) a wall? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3, 2).\n  - Is (1, 1) part of the snake's body? Let's see the body segments: (2, 2), (2, 3), ..., (5, 4). (1, 1) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- Food at (1, 1)? No food is listed at (1, 1).\n- Safety: This move seems safe; no immediate threats.\n\n**Option 2: Right (R) to (3, 1)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Is (3, 1) a wall? No.\n  - Is (3, 1) part of the snake's body? Checking the body segments: not present.\n- Food at (3, 1)? No food listed here.\n- Safety: Also safe, but let's see if it leads to better opportunities.\n\n**Comparing L and R**:\nBoth moves are safe with no immediate food. We might consider future paths:\n- Moving Left (L) to (1, 1):\n  - Next moves could be Left to (0,1) (wall), Up to (1,2), or Down to (1,0) (wall).\n  - (1,2): not a wall, not in body (body has (2,2), etc.), no food.\n- Moving Right (R) to (3, 1):\n  - Next moves could be Right to (4,1), Up to (3,2), or Down to (3,0) (wall).\n  - (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so invalid.\n  - (4,1): not a wall, not in body, no food.\n  \nNeither seems immediately advantageous, but moving Right might keep more options open since moving Left would corner us near the wall.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThe foods are at:\n1. (5,5): value 2, life 1\n2. (5,6): value 4, life 1\n3. (4,6): value 10, life 1\n\nAll foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nCurrent head is at (2,1). Distance to foods:\n- (5,5): Manhattan distance = |5-2| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- (5,6): distance = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (4,6): distance = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nIt's impossible to reach any food this turn since the maximum move is 1 step. So, we cannot eat any food this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\nTail is at (5,4). Is there food at (5,4)? No, foods are at (5,5), (5,6), (4,6). So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Decision Between L and R\n\nBoth moves are safe with no immediate benefits. Moving Right might be slightly better to stay away from the left wall, giving more flexibility in future moves.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body:\nAfter moving Right to (3,1), the next segment is (2,1), which will move to (2,2), etc. The body is long, and we need to ensure we don't trap ourselves.\n\nAlternative consideration: the snake is very long (15 segments), and the board is 8x8 with walls and obstacles. Space is limited. Maybe moving Left is better to start coiling the snake.\n\nBut with no immediate food and both moves safe, either is acceptable. Right seems slightly more central.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both options, moving **Right (R)** seems marginally better to maintain more open space for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 2) is a single wall inside the grid.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head. The head is at (3, 1), and the body follows until the tail at (6, 4).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the **Right (R)**.\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (5, 5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 6): value = 3, life_span = 1\n   - (4, 6): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's body and food positions:\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head: (3, 1)\n  - Body: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)\n  \n  The snake is quite long, and its body winds around the grid.\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (5, 5): Positive food (value +1)\n  - (5, 6): Positive food (value +3)\n  - (4, 6): Positive food (value +9)\n\nAll food items have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving **Right (R)**. From the head at (3, 1), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3, 2)\n   - Check if (3, 2) is a wall: Yes, it's an internal obstacle. **Invalid move**.\n2. **Down (D)**: (3, 0)\n   - Check if (3, 0) is a wall: y=0 is a border wall. **Invalid move**.\n3. **Left (L)**: (2, 1)\n   - Current direction is R, so moving L is the opposite direction. **Invalid move** (no instant reverse).\n4. **Right (R)**: (4, 1)\n   - Check if (4, 1) is a wall: No walls here.\n   - Check if (4, 1) is part of the snake's body: Looking at the snake positions, (4, 1) is not listed. **Valid move**.\n\nSo, the only valid move from the current position is **Right (R)** to (4, 1).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Right to (4, 1) allows us to eat any food:\n\n- The new head position would be (4, 1). Is any food at (4, 1)? No, the foods are at (5,5), (5,6), and (4,6). So, no food is eaten by moving Right.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nGiven that moving Right is the only valid move, but it doesn't lead to eating any food, is there any way to reach food this turn?\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n\n1. (5, 5): To reach this, the snake would need to be near it. Currently, the head is at (3,1), which is quite far. Not reachable in one move.\n2. (5, 6): Similarly, too far.\n3. (4, 6): Also far from (3,1).\n\nGiven the snake's current position and length, none of the food items are reachable in a single move. \n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (6, 4).\n- Adjacent cells to the tail:\n  - Up: (6, 5)\n  - Down: (6, 3) — part of the snake's body (from positions: ..., (6,3), (6,4))\n  - Left: (5, 4)\n  - Right: (7, 4) — x=7 is a wall.\n\nThe head is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to the tail at (6,4). So, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state:\n- The only valid move is **Right (R)** to (4, 1).\n- Moving Right doesn't lead to eating any food this turn.\n- All other moves are invalid due to walls, body collision, or instant reverse.\n\nTherefore, the immediate action for the current turn is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. The current positions are:\n     - Head: (4, 1)\n     - Body: [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - (5, 6): Value = 3, Life Span = 1\n     - (4, 6): Value = 8, Life Span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations.\n\n- **Head at (4,1)**, moving Right (R).\n- The body segments follow the head, forming a long snake.\n- Food at (5,6) and (4,6) with high values (3 and 8 respectively), but both have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,1) moving Right (R), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Right (R)**: (5,1)\n   - Check if (5,1) is a wall or part of the snake's body.\n   - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=5 is not a border wall. No internal wall at (5,1).\n   - Snake body: Check if (5,1) is in the body segments. The body segments are from (3,1) to (6,3). (5,1) is not in the list.\n   - So, moving Right is possible.\n\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: (4,2)\n   - Check (4,2):\n     - Not a wall (x=4 is not a border, y=2 is not a border, and (4,2) is not an internal wall).\n     - Snake body: Is (4,2) in the body? Looking at the body segments, (4,3) is present, but not (4,2).\n     - So, moving Up is possible.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: (4,0)\n   - Check (4,0):\n     - y=0 is a border wall. So, cannot move Down.\n\n4. **Turn Left (L)**: (3,1)\n   - Current direction is R, so Left is the opposite direction.\n   - Rule: Cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn.\n   - So, cannot move Left.\n\n**Valid Moves**: Right (R) and Up (U).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two possible moves: Right and Up.\n\n#### Option 1: Move Right to (5,1)\n\n- New head position: (5,1)\n- Is there food at (5,1)? No, food is at (5,6) and (4,6).\n- The snake will move forward, tail will move forward, no growth.\n- Check for immediate dangers:\n  - Next to tail? The tail is at (6,3). Distance from (5,1) to (6,3) is |5-6| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent.\n  - No collision with body or walls.\n- Future considerations:\n  - Moving Right takes us away from the high-value food at (4,6) and (5,6), which have life span 1 (will disappear next turn).\n  - Not gaining any points this turn.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Up to (4,2)\n\n- New head position: (4,2)\n- Is there food at (4,2)? No.\n- The snake moves forward, no growth.\n- Check for immediate dangers:\n  - Next to tail? Tail is at (6,3). Distance from (4,2) to (6,3) is |4-6| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent.\n  - No collision with body or walls (internal wall is at (3,2), not (4,2)).\n- Future considerations:\n  - Moving Up takes us closer to the food at (4,6) (value 8) and (5,6) (value 3).\n  - However, both foods have life span 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. So, we cannot reach them this turn (from (4,1) to (4,6) is 5 steps up in one move is impossible).\n  - Thus, moving Up doesn't help in eating the food this turn.\n\n### Considering Food Accessibility\n\nBoth pieces of food are at (5,6) and (4,6) with life span 1. This means:\n\n- They will disappear after this turn, so unless we can eat them this turn, they're irrelevant.\n- Current head is at (4,1). To eat (4,6), need to move up 5 steps in one turn, which is impossible (only one move per turn).\n- Similarly, (5,6) is at x=5,y=6; from (4,1), cannot reach in one move.\n\nThus, the food is effectively out of reach this turn, and we should focus on not dying and positioning for future food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nFrom (4,1), moving:\n\n- Right to (5,1):\n  - Next turn, possible moves from (5,1) with direction R:\n    - Continue R to (6,1)\n    - Turn U to (5,2)\n    - Turn D to (5,0) (but y=0 is wall, so invalid)\n    - Cannot turn L (opposite of R)\n  - From (6,1), next move R would hit wall at (7,1), so would have to turn U or D.\n  \n- Up to (4,2):\n  - Next turn, direction is U, so possible moves:\n    - Continue U to (4,3)\n    - Turn R to (5,2)\n    - Turn L to (3,2) (but (3,2) is an internal wall, so invalid)\n    - Cannot turn D (opposite of U)\n  - From (4,3), the body is at (4,3) (part of the snake), so moving U to (4,3) would collide with body.\n\nThus, moving Up seems risky because the next move could lead to a collision if we continue Up.\n\n### Decision Between Right and Up\n\n- Moving Right:\n  - Safe this turn.\n  - Next turn from (5,1), can move R to (6,1), then options are U or R (but R is wall), so U to (6,2), etc.\n  - Keeps options open without immediate danger.\n\n- Moving Up:\n  - Safe this turn.\n  - Next turn from (4,2), moving U to (4,3) would collide with body.\n  - So, would have to turn R to (5,2), which seems safe but limits options.\n\nGiven that moving Up could lead to a forced move next turn that might be risky, moving Right seems safer.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n\n- Current tail is at (6,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,3), (7,3), (6,2), (6,4).\n- Head is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to (6,3).\n- So, no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween the two possible moves (Right and Up):\n\n- Moving Right is safe and doesn't lead to immediate danger next turn.\n- Moving Up could lead to a risky situation next turn if we have to move into the body.\n- The high-value food is out of reach this turn regardless of the move.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move is to continue moving Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

No, the foods are at (5,6), (4,6), (6,2).\n- After moving right:\n  - The tail (5,3) will move forward, so the segment at (5,3) will be removed, and the new segment added is (6,1).\n  - No food eaten, so length remains the same.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Up (U) to (5,2)\n- New head position: (5,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (5,2) is not in the snake's body segments.\n  - y=2 is within bounds (not a border wall).\n  - Internal walls: (3,2) is a wall, but (5,2) is not.\n- Food at (5,2)? No.\n- After moving up:\n  - Tail moves forward, no food eaten.\n\n### Comparing the Two Options\n\nNeither move immediately eats food, but let's see which is safer or leads to better future options.\n\n- **Moving Right (R) to (6,1)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (6,1):\n    - Current direction is R, so can't move L (opposite).\n    - U: (6,2) → Food at (6,2) with value=10!\n    - D: (6,0) → y=0 is wall, invalid.\n    - R: (7,1) → x=7 is wall, invalid.\n  - So from (6,1), only U is valid, leading to eating the high-value food at (6,2).\n\n- **Moving Up (U) to (5,2)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (5,2):\n    - Current direction is U (since we moved up from R, direction changes to U).\n    - Can't move D (opposite).\n    - U: (5,3) → Currently the tail is at (5,3), but tail will move after this step, so (5,3) will be empty unless the body is there. Wait, let's see:\n      - Current tail is at (5,3), and the segment before is (4,3).\n      - After moving head to (5,2), the tail moves from (5,3) to (4,3), so (5,3) is empty.\n      - So (5,3) is safe to move into.\n    - L: (4,2) → Check if it's body or wall:\n      - (4,2) is not in the body segments (current body: after moving head to (5,2), body is (5,1), (4,1), etc., so (4,2) is free.\n      - Not a wall.\n    - R: (6,2) → Food at (6,2).\n  - So from (5,2), possible moves are U, L, R, with R leading to food.\n\nBetween the two, moving right seems better because the only next move is up to eat the high-value food at (6,2), whereas moving up gives more options but doesn't immediately lead to food.\n\nHowever, moving right to (6,1) then up to (6,2) eats the food at (6,2) next turn. \n\nBut we must check if eating (6,2) is safe:\n- After moving to (6,1), then to (6,2), the tail is at (4,3) (since the snake grows by one when eating food).\n- The new tail would be the old tail, so no immediate collision.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- After moving to (6,1), the tail is at (4,3).\n- Then moving to (6,2) to eat food: the tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (6,2) (distance is more than 1), so no danger.\n\n### Other Food Considerations\n\nOther foods:\n- (5,6) and (4,6) are further away and have lower values (2 and 7) compared to (6,2) which is 10.\n- Their life spans are 1, so they will disappear next turn, but we can't reach them in one move anyway.\n\n### Verifying No Better Immediate Options\n\nIs there a way to eat food immediately?\n- Current head at (5,1), moving right to (6,1) doesn't eat food.\n- Moving up to (5,2) doesn't eat food.\n- No food is at (5,1) or adjacent to it where we can eat in one move.\n\nThus, the best immediate action is to set up for eating the highest value food next turn, which is moving right to (6,1), then up to (6,2).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs moving right to (6,1) risky?\n- (6,1) is safe as checked earlier.\n- Next move to (6,2) is also safe as checked.\n\nAlternative is moving up to (5,2), but then next move to (6,2) is also possible, but the food at (6,2) is more directly accessible by first moving right.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe optimal immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (6,1), setting up to eat the high-value food at (6,2) in the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the snake's position, the food available, and any potential dangers.\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's head is at (6, 1), followed by the body segments in order: (5, 1), (4, 1), ..., (4, 3). The snake is quite long, with 15 segments.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the **Right (R)**. This means the last move was to the right, from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\n**Walls**:\n- **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot go outside these bounds.\n- **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5, 6): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food (+1 score, increases length by 1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn (life_span decreases to 0 next turn)\n2. (4, 6): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food (+6 score, increases length by 1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn\n3. (6, 2): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food (+9 score, increases length by 1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,1) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (6, 2)\n- **Down (D)**: (6, 0) → but y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Left (L)**: (5, 1) → but this is the snake's neck (immediately after the head), so it's the reverse direction, which is not allowed.\n- **Right (R)**: (7, 1) → but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Up (U) to (6, 2)**.\n\n### Checking (6, 2)\n\nAt (6, 2), there is food with value 9, life_span 1. Eating this would:\n- Increase score by 9.\n- Increase length by 1 (new tail would be added where the current tail is, which is (4,3)).\n\nNow, we need to check for **Tail Reward Danger**:\n- After eating, the new tail would be where the current tail is, at (4,3).\n- The head is at (6,2), and the new tail is at (4,3). Are these adjacent?\n  - Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.\n  - (6,2) and (4,3): The distance is |6-4| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3, which is more than 1, so not adjacent.\n  - Therefore, no immediate collision from the new tail.\n\nAlso, check if moving to (6,2) causes any other collisions:\n- The snake's body segments are at: (5,1), (4,1), ..., (4,3). (6,2) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- No walls at (6,2).\n\n### Other Food Considerations\n\nThe other foods are at (5,6) and (4,6), both with life_span 1 (will disappear next turn). They are quite far from the current head position (6,1):\n- Distance to (5,6): |6-5| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- Distance to (4,6): |6-4| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7\nGiven the snake's length and the current position, reaching these in one move is impossible. Also, their high values (1 and 6) are less than the 9 at (6,2).\n\n### Potential Risks if Not Moving Up\n\nIf we don't move up, the only other option is to try to move left, but that's the reverse direction (from R to L), which is not allowed. Down and Right are walls. So, moving Up is the only valid move.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's visualize the snake after moving Up and eating the food at (6,2):\n- New head: (6,2)\n- Body: (6,1), (5,1), ..., (4,3)\n- New tail: added where the current tail is, at (4,3). So the tail is now at (4,3), and the segment before it was (3,3), so the tail moves to (3,3) next turn if we move straight, etc.\n- Head at (6,2) is not adjacent to (3,3) or any other body segment except (6,1), which is the neck (and that's normal).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move is **Up (U)**, which also allows the snake to eat the highest-value food available (+9) without causing any collisions.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 2) is also a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\n   - Head is at (6, 2), direction is Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item: (4, 6) with value = 1 and life_span = 6.\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Up (U). From the rules, the snake cannot make an instant reverse, so it cannot go Down (D) next. Therefore, possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (x, y+1) → (6, 3)\n- Left (L): (x-1, y) → (5, 2)\n- Right (R): (x+1, y) → (7, 2)\n\nBut we must check for collisions with walls or the snake's body.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Up (U) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Check walls: (6,3) is not a wall (x=6 is not a border unless y=0 or 7; y=3 is not a border; (3,2) is a wall but that's not (6,3)).\n   - Check snake body: Look through the snake positions to see if (6,3) is there.\n     - Snake positions: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (4,3)] → (6,3) is not in the list.\n   - Safe to move Up.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (5, 2)**:\n   - Check walls: (5,2) is not a wall.\n   - Check snake body: Is (5,2) in the snake?\n     - Scanning the list: (5,1) is there, but not (5,2).\n   - Safe to move Left.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (7, 2)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a border wall → cannot move here.\n   - Not a valid move.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Up (U) or Left (L).\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThere's one food at (4,6):\n- Current head is at (6,2).\n- To reach (4,6), the snake needs to move left and up.\n- Moving Up now to (6,3) doesn't immediately get us closer to the food in terms of Manhattan distance (from (6,2) to (4,6) is |6-4| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6; from (6,3) to (4,6) is 2 + 3 = 5; from (5,2) to (4,6) is 1 + 4 = 5).\n- Both Up and Left reduce the distance equally, but let's see which path might be safer or more direct.\n\n### Checking Future Moves After Each Option\n\n1. **If we go Up to (6,3)**:\n   - Next head position: (6,3).\n   - From there, possible moves (assuming direction is now U unless we change):\n     - Continue U to (6,4): need to check if (6,4) is safe.\n     - L to (5,3).\n     - R to (7,3) - wall, invalid.\n   - Moving towards food: from (6,3), to get to (4,6), best is to go Left to (5,3), then Left to (4,3), then Up to (4,4), etc.\n\n2. **If we go Left to (5,2)**:\n   - Next head position: (5,2).\n   - From there, possible moves (direction is now L unless we change):\n     - U to (5,3).\n     - Continue L to (4,2).\n     - D to (5,1) - but (5,1) is part of the snake's body (second segment), so this would collide unless the tail moves.\n     - Tail is at (4,3), so after moving left to (5,2), the tail moves from (4,3) to... let's see:\n       - Snake was: [(6,2), (6,1), ..., (4,3)].\n       - After moving left: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), ..., (3,3)] (last segment (4,3) is removed unless we eat food, which we're not here).\n     - So (5,1) is now the second segment (from (6,1)), so moving D to (5,1) would collide with the body.\n   - So from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3) or L to (4,2).\n   - Moving towards food: from (5,2), to (4,6), best is to go Left to (4,2), then Up to (4,3), etc.\n\nComparing both, both initial moves lead towards the food, but let's see if one is safer.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Up or Left?\n\n- Moving Up to (6,3):\n  - Next possible moves: U to (6,4), L to (5,3).\n  - (6,4) seems safe (not in snake or walls).\n  - (5,3) seems safe (not in snake or walls).\n\n- Moving Left to (5,2):\n  - Next possible moves: U to (5,3), L to (4,2).\n  - (5,3) is safe.\n  - (4,2): is this safe?\n    - Walls: (3,2) is a wall, but (4,2) is not listed as a wall.\n    - Snake body: scanning the positions, (4,1) is there, but not (4,2).\n    - So (4,2) is safe.\n\nBoth seem safe. \n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is a special rule where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4,3). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head is at (6,2), tail at (4,3).\n- Distance: |6-4| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3, which is more than 1 (adjacent means distance 1), so not adjacent.\n- So this rule doesn't apply now.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nThe food is at (4,6), value +1, life_span 6.\n- Current turn is 72, so it will disappear at turn 72 + 6 = 78.\n- We have time to reach it, but let's see how to get there.\n\nFrom (6,2):\n- Path to (4,6): need to go left twice and up four times, e.g., L to (5,2), L to (4,2), U to (4,3), U to (4,4), U to (4,5), U to (4,6).\n- Or U to (6,3), L to (5,3), L to (4,3), U to (4,4), etc.\n\nBoth paths are similar in length, but moving Left first might be slightly more direct because it gets us to x=4 faster, where the food is.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Up and Left, both are safe and both lead towards the food. Moving Left first seems slightly more direct because it reduces the x-coordinate towards the food's x=4 immediately.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions After Left Move\n\nAfter moving Left to (5,2):\n- New head: (5,2).\n- Snake body: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), ..., (4,3)].\n- Next possible moves from (5,2):\n  - U to (5,3): safe.\n  - L to (4,2): safe.\n  - D to (5,1): (5,1) is the second segment now (from (6,1)), so would collide.\n  - R to (6,2): reverse, not allowed (current direction would be L after moving L, opposite is R, which is reverse).\nSo next moves would be U or L, both safe.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nGiven that both Up and Left are safe and lead towards the food, but Left seems slightly more direct, I'll choose Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- Positions (head first): [(5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)]\n  - Head is at (5, 2).\n  - Tail is at (3, 3).\n- Current direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous move.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n1. (4, 6): value = 5, life_span = 1\n2. (6, 4): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 2) moving left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 3)\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 1)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 2)\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 2)\n\nBut we cannot reverse the direction immediately. Since the current direction is Left (L), the opposite direction is Right (R). So, we cannot move Right next. Therefore, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (5, 3)\n- Check if (5, 3) is safe:\n  - Not a wall: x=5 is not 0 or 7; y=3 is not 0 or 7.\n  - Not an internal obstacle: (3,2) is the only one, so (5,3) is clear.\n  - Not colliding with body:\n    - Snake body segments: from (6,2) to (3,3). Checking if (5,3) is in this list.\n    - (5,3) is not in the body positions. The closest is (3,3), (3,4), etc., not (5,3).\n  - So, (5,3) is safe.\n- Is there food at (5,3)? No, food is at (4,6) and (6,4).\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new tail is at (4,3) (assuming the tail was at (3,3), but actually the tail is the last segment, which is (3,3), and it will move to where the second last segment was, but the body is complex. For simplicity, moving up doesn't directly lead to food, so it's a safe move but not rewarding immediately.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (5, 1)\n- Check if (5, 1) is safe:\n  - Not a wall: x=5, y=1 are within bounds.\n  - Not an obstacle.\n  - Check body collision:\n    - Current body segments include (6,1), (5,1), etc. So (5,1) is occupied by the body.\n    - Specifically, (5,1) is the 4th segment in the body list (index 3, 0-based).\n    - Moving here would collide with the body, which is deadly.\n  - So, (5,1) is unsafe.\n- Cannot move Down.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L) to (4, 2)\n- Check if (4, 2) is safe:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not the internal obstacle (which is at (3,2), not (4,2)).\n  - Check body collision:\n    - Body segments: from (6,2) onwards. (4,2) is not in the list.\n    - Wait, the body is [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ...], so (4,2) is not in the body.\n  - So, (4,2) is safe.\n- Is there food at (4,2)? No, food is at (4,6) and (6,4).\n- Moving left is safe but doesn't eat food immediately.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (4,6): value=5, life=1\n   - Distance from head (5,2): |5-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n   - To reach (4,6) in one move is impossible; need multiple moves.\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach it in time.\n2. (6,4): value=10, life=1\n   - Distance from head (5,2): |5-6| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n   - Also cannot reach in one move; will disappear after this turn.\n\nSo, neither food can be eaten this turn because they're too far and will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food under the tail?\n- Tail is at (3,3).\n- Head is at (5,2).\n- Adjacent means distance of 1: |5-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nSince neither food can be eaten this turn, and both will disappear after this turn, our priority is just to stay alive and not collide.\n\nPossible safe moves:\n- Up (U) to (5,3)\n- Left (L) to (4,2)\n\nWhich is better?\n- Moving Up (U): heads towards y=3, which is open space.\n- Moving Left (L): heads towards x=4, which is also open, but looking at the body, moving left might be better to explore more space.\n\nLooking at the body:\n- The snake is long and wrapped around. Moving left seems to keep us away from the body more than moving up, where we might get boxed in.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Danger\n\nAfter moving Left to (4,2), next possible moves:\n- From (4,2), direction is Left.\n- Next moves could be U, D, L (not R, opposite of L).\n  - U: (4,3) - check body: not in body, safe.\n  - D: (4,1) - in body (current body has (5,1), (4,1), etc.), so unsafe.\n  - L: (3,2) - obstacle, so cannot.\nSo next move would likely be U.\n\nAlternatively, if we move Up to (5,3), next moves:\n- From (5,3), direction is Up.\n- Possible: U, L, R (not D).\n  - U: (5,4) - check body: not in body, safe.\n  - L: (4,3) - safe.\n  - R: (6,3) - safe.\nMore options next turn if we move Up now.\n\nGiven that, moving Up seems to give more flexibility next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween Up and Left, both are safe, but moving Up gives more options next turn. Moving Left might lead to fewer options next turn (only Up is safe after Left).\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Up**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: (3, 2) is a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (4,6): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (6,4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Head**: (5,3)\n- **Direction**: Up means the head is moving towards increasing y-coordinate (from (5,3) to (5,4)).\n\nPossible next moves from (5,3) in direction U:\n- Up (U): (5,4)\n- Left (L): (4,3)\n- Right (R): (6,3)\n- Down (D): (5,2) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is U, the possible moves without reversing are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,4) is not a wall (x=5 is not 0 or 7; y=4 is not 0 or 7; and it's not (3,2)).\n     - Body: Is (5,4) in the snake's body? Let's scan the positions:\n       - The body segments are from (5,2) onwards. (5,4) is not in the list.\n   - Food at (5,4)? No, food is at (4,6) and (6,4).\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Is (4,3) in the body? Scanning: no.\n   - Food at (4,3)? No.\n   - Safe move, but no food.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (6,3) is not a wall (x=6 is not 7 yet, y=3 is not 0 or 7; not (3,2)).\n     - Body: Is (6,3) in the body? Scanning: no.\n   - Food at (6,3)? No.\n   - Safe move, but no food.\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But both foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn. So we need to consider paths to reach them soon.\n\n### Evaluating Paths to Food\n\nLet's see how to reach each food:\n\n1. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Current head: (5,3)\n   - To reach (4,6):\n     - Need to go left to x=4 and up to y=6.\n     - Possible path: Left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), then (4,5), then (4,6).\n     - But food disappears after this turn, so can't reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (6,4)**:\n   - Current head: (5,3)\n   - To reach (6,4):\n     - Need to go right to x=6 and up to y=4.\n     - Immediate move right to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n     - But food disappears after this turn, so only if we can reach it in one move.\n     - Current move is from (5,3), can we go to (6,4) directly?\n       - From (5,3), possible moves are U (5,4), L (4,3), R (6,3).\n       - Diagonal moves aren't allowed, so can't go directly to (6,4).\n   - So can't reach (6,4) this turn either.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince both foods will disappear after this turn, and we can't reach either in one move, our immediate goal is to position the snake to be able to reach future food that may appear.\n\nCurrent possible moves (U, L, R):\n\n1. **Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - Opens up more space above.\n   - Next moves from (5,4): U (5,5), L (4,4), R (6,4).\n\n2. **Left (L) to (4,3)**:\n   - Moves towards the left side where there's more space.\n   - Next moves from (4,3): U (4,4), L (3,3) — but (3,3) is adjacent to wall at (3,2), D (4,2).\n\n3. **Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n   - Moves towards the right side.\n   - Next moves from (6,3): U (6,4), L (5,3) — but (5,3) is the previous head position (body), D (6,2) — which is body.\n\nRight now, moving right seems less optimal because it brings us closer to the body and limits future moves.\n\nBetween U and L:\n\n- Up (U) to (5,4) seems better because:\n  - It moves away from the long body.\n  - From (5,4), we can go U to (5,5), L to (4,4), or R to (6,4), giving more options.\n  \nLeft (L) to (4,3) is also safe but may lead to more constrained positions soon.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous?\n\nTail is the last segment: (3,4).\nFood is at (4,6) and (6,4), neither is adjacent to (3,4), so no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- We can't reach any food this turn.\n- Moving Up seems to provide more future flexibility.\n- Moving Left is safe but may limit options.\n- Moving Right is less optimal due to body proximity.\n\n**Best immediate action is to move Up (U).**\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety (no collision) and potential rewards.\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5, 5)**:\n   - Check for walls: y=5 is not a border wall (y=7 is the top border).\n   - Check for obstacles: No internal obstacle at (5, 5).\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - The snake's body segments are at: (5,3), (5,2), ..., (3,5). \n     - (5,5) is not in the body segments list.\n   - **Safety**: Safe to move.\n   - **Food**: No food at (5,5).\n   - **Outcome**: Just moves the snake forward, no score change.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (4, 4)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=4 is not a border wall.\n   - Check for obstacles: No obstacle at (4,4).\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - (4,4) is not in the body segments list.\n   - **Safety**: Safe to move.\n   - **Food**: No food at (4,4).\n   - **Outcome**: Just moves the snake forward, no score change.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6, 4)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=6 is not a border wall (x=7 is the right border).\n   - Check for obstacles: No obstacle at (6,4).\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - (6,4) is not in the body segments list.\n   - **Safety**: Safe to move.\n   - **Food**: There is food at (6,4) with value=8, life_span=1.\n     - Since the life_span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n     - Eating it will increase the snake's length by 1 and add 8 to the score.\n     - Need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - The tail is at (3,5). Is (3,5) adjacent to the head (5,4)? \n       - Adjacent means sharing an edge (up, down, left, right), not diagonal.\n       - Distance from (5,4) to (3,5): |5-3|=2, |4-5|=1 → total 3 (not adjacent).\n       - Alternatively, adjacent cells to (5,4) are (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4). (3,5) is not in this list.\n       - So, no tail reward danger.\n   - **Outcome**: Eating high-value food (+8), length increases by 1.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, high reward (+8).\n\nGiven that moving Right leads to eating high-value food without any immediate danger, it seems like the best choice.\n\n### Verifying Potential Dangers After Eating\n\nAfter eating the food at (6,4), the snake's length will increase by 1, and the new tail will be the old tail (since the tail moves forward when the head moves unless the head eats food). \n\nBut since the food is at (6,4) and the head moves to (6,4), the new segment is added to the head, and the tail remains where it was (it doesn't grow until the next move). \n\nHowever, we need to ensure that in the next move, the new tail (which would be the second last segment before the current tail) doesn't cause a collision. \n\nBut since the tail is at (3,5), and the new tail after growth would be the segment before (3,5) in the list, which is (2,5), which is not adjacent to (6,4), there's no immediate danger.\n\n### Checking Other Constraints\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is Up (\"U\"), so cannot go Down (\"D\"), which is already excluded.\n- **Food under body**: No food is under the snake's body in this state.\n- **Wall collisions**: Already checked for each move.\n\n### Considering Food Lifespan\n\nThe food at (6,4) has a life_span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. The other food at (4,6) also has a life_span of 1, but it's not reachable in one move from the current head position (from (5,4) to (4,6) requires moving left and up, which is two moves). So, the only food we can eat this turn is at (6,4).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all the above considerations:\n\n- Moving Right (\"R\") allows the snake to eat the high-value food (+8) safely.\n- Other moves do not provide any immediate reward.\n- There are no immediate dangers associated with moving Right.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Yes, it's the first body segment.\n     - Normally, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail moves away, but we need to see if the tail is moving away.\n     - The tail is at (3,5). The segment before it is (2,5), so the tail is moving from (3,5) to (2,5) next turn (assuming the head moves and the body follows).\n     - So, moving left to (5,4) would make the head go to (5,4), and the first body segment (currently at (5,4)) would move to where the head was (6,4), so no collision.\n     - However, is there food at (5,4)? No.\n     - Also, since the current direction is R, moving L is the opposite direction, which is not allowed unless it's safe (but here it's the body segment).\n     - **Generally, moving opposite to current direction is not allowed unless it's safe, but here it's into the body, so likely invalid**.\n   - **Invalid move** (due to opposite direction into body).\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **(4,6)**: Value = 2, Life Span = 1\n   - Distance from head (6,4):\n     - Δx = |6-4| = 2, Δy = |4-6| = 2 → Manhattan distance = 4.\n   - To reach it in 1 turn (since life span is 1), we'd need to be adjacent, but distance is 4 → cannot reach it this turn.\n   - It will disappear after this turn since life span decreases to 0.\n   - **Not reachable this turn**.\n2. **(3,5)**: Value = 10, Life Span = 1\n   - Distance from head (6,4):\n     - Δx = |6-3| = 3, Δy = |4-5| = 1 → Manhattan distance = 4.\n   - Similarly, cannot reach in 1 turn.\n   - It will disappear after this turn.\n   - **Not reachable this turn**.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail having positive food:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (3,5).\n- Adjacent to tail: (2,5), (4,5), (3,4), (3,6).\n- Head is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to (3,5) → no danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Right: Invalid (wall).\n- Left: Invalid (opposite direction into body).\n- Up or Down: Both valid, no immediate food to consider.\n\nWhich is better between Up and Down?\n\n1. **Up (U) to (6,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (6,5):\n     - Right: (7,5) → wall.\n     - Left: (5,5) → check if free.\n     - Up: (6,6) → free (not in body, not wall).\n     - Down: (6,4) → where the head just was, but the first body segment is moving there, so would collide unless the tail moves away.\n   - (5,5): Not in body, not wall.\n   - (6,6): Not in body, not wall.\n   - Seems safe, opens up options.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (6,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (6,3):\n     - Right: (7,3) → wall.\n     - Left: (5,3) → in body (second segment is (5,3)).\n     - Up: (6,4) → where the head was, first body segment moving there.\n     - Down: (6,2) → in body (fourth segment is (6,2)).\n   - Only possible next move would be Left to (5,3), but that's into the body → risky.\n   - Seems more restrictive.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving Up (U) to (6,5) seems better as it opens up more options next turn without immediate risk.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- Moving to (6,5):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not in body.\n  - No food to eat (so no growth, tail moves from (3,5) to (2,5)).\n  - Next head position won't collide with the new tail.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Up (U) to (6, 6)\n\n- **Position**: (6, 6)\n- **Check Walls**: \n  - y=7 is a border wall, so (6, 6) is safe (next move would be at y=7, but that's for the next turn).\n- **Check Body Collision**:\n  - The snake's body segments are from (6,4) onwards. (6,6) is not in the body.\n- **Check Food**:\n  - No food at (6,6).\n- **Safety**: Safe move.\n- **Reward**: No immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5, 5)\n\n- **Position**: (5, 5)\n- **Check Walls**: \n  - No walls at (5,5).\n- **Check Body Collision**:\n  - The body segments are at (6,4), (5,4), ..., (2,5). (5,5) is not in the body.\n- **Check Food**:\n  - No food at (5,5).\n- **Safety**: Safe move.\n- **Reward**: No immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7, 5)\n\n- **Position**: (7, 5)\n- **Check Walls**: \n  - x=7 is a border wall, so (7,5) is a wall cell.\n- **Safety**: Moving into a wall is deadly.\n- **Conclusion**: Not a viable move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions:\n\n1. **(4, 6)**: value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - Currently at turn 77, life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Distance from head (6,5): |6-4| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Manhattan distance).\n   - Cannot reach it in one move; would need at least 3 moves.\n   - Since life_span is 1, it's impossible to reach it before it disappears.\n   - **Conclusion**: Ignore this food.\n\n2. **(3, 5)**: value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - High-value food (value = 9).\n   - Life_span = 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Distance from head (6,5): |6-3| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n   - Cannot reach it in one move; would need at least 3 moves.\n   - **Conclusion**: Also impossible to reach this turn.\n\nSince both foods will disappear after this turn and cannot be reached immediately, we don't need to consider them for the current move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nEven though we can't reach food this turn, we should consider moves that might set us up for future opportunities or avoid getting trapped.\n\n- **Move Up (U) to (6,6)**:\n  - Next moves from (6,6): \n    - Continue Up: (6,7) - but y=7 is a wall, so that's deadly next turn.\n    - Left: (5,6)\n    - Right: (7,6) - x=7 is a wall, so deadly.\n  - So from (6,6), only safe next move is Left to (5,6).\n  - Then from (5,6), possible moves would be Left (4,6), Down (5,5), or Up (5,7) - but Up is wall.\n  - Seems like we might be limiting our options by going Up now.\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (5,5)**:\n  - From (5,5), possible next moves:\n    - Up: (5,6)\n    - Left: (4,5)\n    - Down: (5,4) - but (5,4) is a body segment (second segment currently at (6,4), but by then the tail would have moved).\n     - Current tail is at (2,5), and the body is long, but need to check if (5,4) is still body after moving.\n     - After moving head to (5,5), the body will be (5,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc.\n     - So (5,4) is the third segment, so moving Down to (5,4) would collide with body.\n    - So from (5,5), safe moves are Up or Left.\n  - More options than after moving Up.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is about the tail having positive food and being adjacent to the head after growing. Currently, the tail is at (2,5), and there's no food there (food is at (4,6) and (3,5)), so this isn't a concern now.\n\n### Decision Between Up and Left\n\nBetween moving Up or Left:\n\n- **Up (U) to (6,6)**:\n  - Next turn only safe move is Left to (5,6).\n  - Then from (5,6), options are Left or Down (but Down may be body collision depending on snake position then).\n  - Seems like we're moving towards the top-left corner, which might limit mobility.\n\n- **Left (L) to (5,5)**:\n  - Next turn can go Up or Left.\n  - More options to maneuver.\n  - Currently, the snake is long, and we're in a somewhat convoluted position; moving Left seems to open up more space.\n\n### Verifying Body Collision After Left Move\n\nAfter moving Left to (5,5), the new body positions will be:\n\nHead: (5,5)\nBody: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., (2,5)\n\nNow, possible next moves from (5,5):\n\n- Up to (5,6): \n  - Not in body: (6,5), (6,4), etc. - (5,6) is safe.\n- Left to (4,5):\n  - Not in body: safe.\n- Down to (5,4):\n  - (5,4) is the third body segment after move (after (6,5) and (6,4)), so collision.\n- Right to (6,5):\n  - (6,5) is the first body segment, so collision.\n\nSo indeed, from (5,5), can go Up or Left safely next turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Left seems better as it provides more options next turn compared to moving Up, which would corner us more.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the game:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls; the snake cannot move into these cells.\n   - Internal obstacle: There's a wall at (3, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions are given as a list from head to tail: \n     - Head: (5, 5)\n     - Next segments: (6, 5), (6, 4), ..., (1, 5) (tail)\n   - Current head direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food item is present at (3, 5) with:\n     - Value: 1 (positive food)\n     - Life span: 9 turns remaining (including the current turn)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better visualize, let's sketch a rough map (not to scale):\n\n- The snake's head is at (5, 5), moving left (from (6,5) to (5,5)).\n- The tail is at (1, 5).\n- Food is at (3, 5).\n  \nLooking at the snake's body segments, the path from head to tail is:\n(5,5) ← (6,5) ← (6,4) ← (5,4) ← (5,3) ← (5,2) ← (6,2) ← (6,1) ← (5,1) ← (4,1) ← (3,1) ← (2,1) ← (2,2) ← (2,3) ← (2,4) ← (1,4) ← (1,5)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nFrom the head at (5,5), moving left (L) was the last move. The possible moves now are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (4,5) - But we just moved left, so moving left again is allowed unless it's a reverse (which it's not; reverse would be right).\n   - Check if (4,5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not 0 or 7, y=5 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (3,2) is the only internal wall, so (4,5) is clear.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Check the list; (4,5) is not in the snake's positions.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n   - Check validity:\n     - y=6 is not a wall (y=7 is the border, so y=6 is okay).\n     - x=5 is not a wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not in snake's body: Checking the list, (5,6) is not present.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n   - Check validity:\n     - y=4 is not a wall.\n     - x=5 is not a wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Is it in the snake's body? Yes: (5,4) is the 4th segment from the head. Moving here would collide with the body, which is deadly.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n   - This is the reverse of the current direction (left). The rules state: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n   - So, moving right is not allowed because the current direction is left.\n\nThus, the valid moves are: Left (L) to (4,5) or Up (U) to (5,6). Down is invalid (body collision), and Right is invalid (instant reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two valid moves:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (4,5)**:\n   - New head position: (4,5)\n   - Is there food here? No, food is at (3,5).\n   - After moving left, the next possible moves would be from (4,5):\n     - Left to (3,5): which has food.\n     - Up to (4,6)\n     - Down to (4,4)\n     - Right to (5,5): reverse of left, so invalid next turn.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5,6)**:\n   - New head position: (5,6)\n   - Is there food here? No.\n   - Next possible moves from (5,6):\n     - Up to (5,7): but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n     - Left to (4,6)\n     - Right to (6,6)\n     - Down to (5,5): reverse of up, so invalid next turn.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe food is at (3,5) with a value of +1 and life span of 9. To reach it:\n\nFrom (5,5):\n- Left to (4,5), then left to (3,5): eats food in two moves.\n  \nFrom (5,5):\n- Up to (5,6), then left to (4,6), then down to (4,5), then left to (3,5): takes longer.\n\nThus, moving left first seems more direct to reach the food.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (1,5).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (0,5) - wall, (2,5), (1,6), (1,4).\n- Head is at (5,5), not adjacent to tail (distance is 4 in x-direction).\n- Food is at (3,5), not on the tail (tail is at (1,5)), so no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving left to (4,5):\n- Next move left to (3,5) would eat the food.\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move.\n- New head at (3,5), body extends to (4,5), (5,5), etc.\n- Then, possible moves from (3,5):\n  - Left to (2,5): but (2,5) is not in the current snake body (current tail is at (1,5)), but let's see the body after growth:\n    - Original body: [(5,5), (6,5), ..., (1,5)]\n    - After moving left twice: head at (3,5), body: [(4,5), (5,5), ..., (1,5)] + new tail segment (since length increased by 1, the last segment (1,5) is not removed).\n    - Wait, no: when snake grows, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (1,5)].\n    - So (2,5) is not in the body, but (2,1) to (2,4) are in the body, but not (2,5).\n    - So left to (2,5) is safe.\n  - Up to (3,6)\n  - Down to (3,4)\n  - Right to (4,5): but this is the body segment, so deadly.\n\nSo after eating, moving left to (2,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,6) doesn't lead directly to food and may delay reaching it, risking the food disappearing (though life span is 9, so plenty of time).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving left is valid and leads directly toward the food without immediate danger, and moving up doesn't provide a clear advantage, the better immediate action is to move left.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions\n\nMoving left to (4,5):\n- Is (4,5) in the snake's body? Checking the list: no.\n- Is it a wall? No.\n- Is it an obstacle? No.\n- Is it a reverse move? No, current direction is left, moving left is same direction, not opposite.\n\nAll checks pass.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 79  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first):\n- Head: (4, 5)\n- Body segments: (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left, which is decreasing x, same y)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (3, 5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n2. (5, 2): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Head at (4,5)**, moving Left (L), so previous position was to its right, which is (5,5).\n- The food at (3,5) is directly to the left of the head (since moving left from (4,5) lands on (3,5)).\n- The other food is at (5,2), which is currently under the snake's body (specifically at the segment (5,2)).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) moving Left (L), the possible moves are:\n- **Continue Left (L)**: (3,5)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: (4,6)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: (4,4)\n  \nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of the current direction (L), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n**1. Move Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n- This is where the food (3,5,8,1) is located.\n- Check if eating this food is safe:\n  - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be the current tail (1,4) plus the new segment where the head was (4,5).\n  - Need to ensure that after moving, the head doesn't collide with the body.\n  - Current body segments after head: (5,5), (6,5), etc. (3,5) is not in the immediate body segments after the head.\n  - Also, check if the tail has positive food that could cause a collision after growth:\n    - Tail is at (1,4). Is there positive food there? No food is listed at (1,4), so no danger from \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n- Food at (3,5) is positive (+8), so this is a good move to gain points.\n- Also, the life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n  \n**Potential Risks**:\n- After moving left, the head is at (3,5), next to the body segment (5,5). But (3,5) is not adjacent to (5,5) (they are two units apart in x), so no immediate collision.\n- Next moves would need to be considered, but for immediate action, this seems safe.\n\n**2. Move Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n- Check if (4,6) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: y=7 is a wall, so y=6 is valid.\n  - Not occupied by body: Looking at snake positions, (4,6) is not listed, so safe.\n- No food at (4,6), so no points gained.\n- Food at (3,5) will disappear next turn (life_span=1), missing a chance to gain +8.\n\n**3. Move Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n- Check if (4,4) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: y=0 is wall, y=4 is valid.\n  - Not occupied by body: Checking snake positions, (4,4) is not listed, so safe.\n- No food at (4,4), so no points.\n- Similar to moving up, missing the +8 food.\n\n### Considering the Food Under the Body at (5,2)\n\nThe other food is at (5,2), which is currently under the snake's body segment (5,2). Rules state:\n- Food under body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away (i.e., the segment at (5,2) moves), and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (4,5), and (5,2) is far away in terms of immediate movement. To eat this food:\n- The segment at (5,2) would need to move, which happens as the snake moves forward.\n- The head would need to reach (5,2), which is not possible in one move from (4,5).\n  \nGiven that, we cannot eat the (5,2) food this turn, and its life_span is also 1, so it will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Decision Between Moves\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (3,5): \n  - Eats positive food (+8), safe move.\n  - Food will disappear if not eaten now.\n  \n- Moving Up (U) or Down (D):\n  - No points gained.\n  - Miss the +8 food.\n\nClearly, moving Left to eat the +8 food is the best immediate action, provided it's safe.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Left\n\n- New head position: (3,5)\n- Current body segments after head: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), etc.\n- Is (3,5) adjacent to any body segment that could cause a collision next turn?\n  - Adjacent to (3,5) are:\n    - (2,5): not in body\n    - (4,5): was head, now second segment\n    - (3,4): not in body\n    - (3,6): not in body\n  - The only adjacent body segment is (5,5), which is two units away in x, so not adjacent.\n  \n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the tail stays where it is (1,4), and a new segment is added where the head was (4,5).\n- No immediate collision risk.\n\n### Checking for \"Tail Reward Danger\"\n\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food. Eating that food would make the head and new tail collide.\n- Current tail is at (1,4).\n- Is head adjacent to tail? Head is at (4,5), tail at (1,4): distance is sqrt((4-1)^2 + (5-4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 1) = sqrt(10) > 1, so not adjacent.\n- Thus, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to (3,5) to eat the positive food worth +8 before it disappears, and this move is safe based on the current snake configuration.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), with borders at these edges.\n2. **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 2).\n3. **Snake Position**: The snake's head is at (3, 5), and the body segments follow in order until the tail at (1, 4). The snake is currently moving left (\"L\").\n4. **Food**: There's one piece of food at (5, 2) with a value of 9 and a life span of 1. This means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's path to understand its current shape and possible movements:\n\n- Head: (3, 5)\n- Next segments: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4) (tail)\n\nThe food is at (5,2), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (7th segment from the head). \n\n### Food Mechanics\n\nThe food is under the snake's body at (5,2). To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (5,2).\n2. The head must move onto (5,2) in the same turn.\n\nGiven that the food's life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so we must act now to eat it.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving left (\"L\"). The possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: Continue left to (2,5). But we need to check if this is safe.\n- **Up (U)**: From (3,5), moving up to (3,6). But the current direction is left; can we turn up?\n- **Down (D)**: From (3,5), moving down to (3,4). Similarly, can we turn down?\n\n**No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is left, we cannot move right (\"R\") next.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2,5)**:\n   - Is (2,5) occupied by the snake's body? Checking the body segments: no, (2,5) is not in the list.\n   - Is (2,5) a wall? Border walls are at x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7. (2,5) is within bounds.\n   - Internal obstacle at (3,2) doesn't affect (2,5).\n   - **Safety**: Safe to move left.\n\n   However, moving left doesn't help in eating the food at (5,2). The body at (5,2) is the 7th segment. Moving the head left will cause the tail to move forward, but the segment at (5,2) will move to (5,3) (since the segment before it is at (5,3)), so (5,2) will be free. But the head is at (3,5), and moving left to (2,5) doesn't reach (5,2). So this move doesn't help eat the food.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (3,6)**:\n   - Is (3,6) occupied? No.\n   - Is (3,6) a wall? y=7 is the border, so (3,6) is safe.\n   - **Safety**: Safe to move up.\n   - Does this help eat the food? The body at (5,2) will move to (5,3), but the head is moving away from (5,2), so no.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (3,4)**:\n   - Is (3,4) occupied? Checking the body: no.\n   - Is (3,4) a wall? No.\n   - **Safety**: Safe to move down.\n   - Does this help eat the food? Similar to up, the head moves away from (5,2), so no.\n\n### Eating the Food\n\nThe food is at (5,2), which is currently occupied by the snake's body. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (5,2): This happens naturally as the snake moves, with the segment at (5,2) moving to (5,3).\n- The head must move onto (5,2) in the same turn.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (3,5). To reach (5,2) in one move is impossible since it requires moving right (+2 in x) and down (-3 in y), which is more than one cell. \n\nThis suggests that it's impossible to eat the food this turn because the head cannot reach (5,2) from (3,5) in one move. \n\nHowever, let's double-check the snake's movement to see if the body at (5,2) will be free after this turn:\n\nAfter any move:\n- The head moves to a new position.\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n- The tail (last segment) is removed.\n\nSo, if we move left to (2,5):\n- New head: (2,5)\n- Body segments:\n  - (3,5) (old head)\n  - (4,5)\n  - (5,5)\n  - (6,5)\n  - (6,4)\n  - (5,4)\n  - (5,3) (from (5,2))\n  - (6,2)\n  - (6,1)\n  - (5,1)\n  - (4,1)\n  - (3,1)\n  - (2,1)\n  - (2,2)\n  - (2,3)\n  - (2,4)\n  - Tail (1,4) is removed.\n\nThe segment at (5,2) moves to (5,3), so (5,2) is now free, but the head is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to (5,2). \n\nSimilarly, moving up or down doesn't help reach (5,2). \n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe food at (5,2) is positive (value=9). After this turn, if the head were adjacent to the tail and the tail had positive food, eating it would be dangerous. But in this case, the tail is at (1,4), and the head is at (3,5), not adjacent (they are two cells apart diagonally), so this isn't a concern here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that:\n- The food at (5,2) cannot be eaten this turn because the head cannot reach it in one move.\n- The food will disappear after this turn regardless.\n- We should choose a safe move that doesn't collide with the body or walls.\n\nPossible safe moves:\n- Left to (2,5): Safe, as (2,5) is not occupied or a wall.\n- Up to (3,6): Safe.\n- Down to (3,4): Safe.\n\nSince the current direction is left, continuing left is a valid option unless there's a better reason to turn. Turning up or down could be for exploration, but since the food is not reachable, and no other food is present, continuing left seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, let's check if moving left leads to any immediate dead ends or traps in future moves. The next position after left is (2,5). From there, possible moves would be left to (1,5), up to (2,6), or down to (2,4). \n\n- (1,5): Not occupied, not a wall.\n- (2,6): Not occupied, not a wall.\n- (2,4): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at (2,4)).\n\nSo, moving left now allows flexibility in the next move (left, up, or down). \n\nAlternatively, moving up or down could be better for exploration, but without more information, continuing left seems safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince we cannot eat the food this turn and continuing left is safe, the best immediate action is to continue moving left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 81  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, since x=0/7 and y=0/7 are walls)\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nThe snake's body is a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. Here's the sequence:\n1. Head: (2, 5)\n2. Next segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so its head moved from (3,5) to (2,5).\n\n**Food**:\n- Only one food item: (5, 2) with value = 8 and life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing the Snake's Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,5), and it's currently moving left (L). From the snake's body, the next segment after the head is (3,5), which is to the right of the head. \n\n**Possible Moves**:\nSince the snake was moving left last turn, it cannot instantly reverse to right (R). So, the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (x, y+1) = (2,6)\n- Down (D): (x, y-1) = (2,4)\n- Left (L): (x-1, y) = (1,5)\n\nBut we need to check if these moves are valid (i.e., not into walls or snake body except the tail).\n\n**Checking Each Move**:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n   - y=6 is a border wall (y=7 is wall, but grid is up to y=6? Wait, border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within bounds.\n   - Is (2,6) occupied by the snake's body? Looking at the snake positions: no, (2,6) isn't listed.\n   - So, this move is valid.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (2,4)**:\n   - y=4 is within bounds (y=1 to y=6).\n   - Is (2,4) in snake's body? Yes, the tail is at (2,4). \n     - Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves forward, but we need to check if the tail has positive food that would cause a collision after growing.\n     - The tail is at (2,4), and the food is at (5,2), so no food at tail. So, moving into the tail is safe here.\n   - So, this move is valid.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n   - x=1 is within bounds (x=1 to x=6).\n   - Is (1,5) in snake's body? No.\n   - So, this move is valid.\n\n**Food Consideration**:\nThe only food is at (5,2) with value 8 (positive) and life_span 1. This means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nCan the snake reach the food this turn?\n- Current head is at (2,5). To reach (5,2) in one move is impossible; it's 3 steps right and 3 steps down.\n- So, the snake cannot eat the food this turn, and the food will disappear after this turn.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger**:\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail has positive food. Eating that food would make the tail grow into the head's new position, causing a collision.\n- Our tail is at (2,4), and head is at (2,5). They are adjacent (one above the other).\n- Is there positive food at the tail (2,4)? No, food is at (5,2).\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nSince the food is out of reach and will disappear after this turn, our primary goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\nPossible moves: U (2,6), D (2,4), L (1,5)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n   - Next turn, from (2,6), possible moves would be U (but y=7 is wall, so invalid), L (1,6), R (3,6), D (2,5).\n   - Moving to (2,6) seems safe, but we're moving towards the top border, which might limit future moves.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (2,4)**:\n   - (2,4) is the tail. After moving, the tail will move forward, so the new tail will be (2,3), and head at (2,4).\n   - This seems safe, but we're moving towards the body's loop. Need to see future moves.\n   - Next turn from (2,4), possible moves would be U (2,5) - but (2,5) is now the second segment (since head moves to (2,4), previous head (2,5) becomes first body segment), so that's invalid (body collision), L (1,4), R (3,4), D (2,3) - which is the new tail, but tail moves, so safe unless food is there (no food at (2,3)).\n   - So, moving down seems okay, but limits next move options.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n   - Moving to (1,5) is towards the left border.\n   - Next turn from (1,5), possible moves: U (1,6), D (1,4), L (0,5) - invalid (wall), R (2,5) - but (2,5) is now first body segment, so invalid.\n   - So, moving left gives options U or D next turn, which seems better than moving up or down now.\n\n**Comparing Moves**:\n- Moving left seems to keep more options open for next moves compared to up or down.\n- Moving down is safe but may lead to tighter spaces soon.\n- Moving up is safe but heads towards the wall quickly.\n\n**Best Choice**: Left (L) to (1,5)\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- Moving left to (1,5):\n  - Not a wall (x=1 is valid).\n  - Not in snake's body (check list: no (1,5)).\n  - No instant reverse (was moving left, still moving left - but no, last move was left to (2,5), so current direction is left, moving left is continuing same direction, not reverse. Reverse would be right, which we're not doing.\n  \nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the current state and future implications, the safest and most strategic immediate action is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The possible moves are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (0, 5) → x=0 is a wall → **invalid** (collision).\n- **Right (R)**: (2, 5) → This is the first body segment → **invalid** (collision).\n- **Up (U)**: (1, 6) → Need to check if this is valid.\n- **Down (D)**: (1, 4) → Need to check if this is valid.\n\nSince we cannot reverse direction instantly (from L to R is opposite), moving right is invalid for the next move. Thus, the only possible moves are Up or Down.\n\n### Checking Valid Moves: Up and Down\n\n**Up (U) to (1, 6)**:\n- Is (1, 6) a wall? y=6 is not a border (y=7 is), and no internal obstacle is at (1, 6) → not a wall.\n- Is (1, 6) occupied by the snake's body? Let's check the snake's positions:\n  - Snake segments: (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,3). (1,6) is not in this list → no collision.\n- So, moving Up is valid.\n\n**Down (D) to (1, 4)**:\n- Is (1, 4) a wall? y=4 is not a border, and no internal obstacle is at (1, 4) → not a wall.\n- Is (1, 4) occupied by the snake's body? Checking the list: (1,4) is not present → no collision.\n- So, moving Down is also valid.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up or Down can lead us to food.\n\n1. **Food at (5, 2)**:\n   - Current head is at (1, 5). Distance is |5-1| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Even if we could reach it in one move (which we can't), it's too far.\n   - Not reachable this turn.\n\n2. **Food at (3, 6)**:\n   - Current head at (1, 5). Distance is |3-1| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n   - Can we reach it in one move? From (1,5), moving Up to (1,6) is one step closer (distance to (3,6) from (1,6) is 2 + 0 = 2).\n   - Not directly reachable this turn, but moving Up gets us closer.\n\nHowever, since the food's life_span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so we cannot reach it in time. Therefore, neither food is immediately accessible this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe must also check if moving to a new position would place the head adjacent to the tail where the tail has positive food that could be eaten next turn, leading to a collision.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2, 3). The food at (5, 2) is not near the tail. The other food is at (3, 6), also not near the tail. So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Choosing Between Up and Down\n\nSince neither food is reachable this turn, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it for future food collection.\n\n**Option 1: Up to (1, 6)**:\n- New head position: (1, 6).\n- Next possible moves from (1,6):\n  - Left: (0,6) → wall.\n  - Right: (2,6) → check if it's part of the body.\n    - Current body: (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,3). (2,6) is not in the body → valid.\n  - Up: (1,7) → y=7 is wall.\n  - Down: (1,5) → current neck (second segment is (2,5)), but (1,5) is where the head was. After moving up, the tail moves forward, so (1,5) might be empty unless the tail is there. Wait, the tail is at (2,3), and the snake is long, so (1,5) would be empty after the tail moves.\n     - Actually, the tail is at (2,3), and the body is [(1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,3)]. After moving up, the new body will be [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (3,1)], and the tail (2,3) will move to (2,2). So (1,5) is now the second segment, and (1,6) is the head. So moving down to (1,5) would collide with the body → invalid.\n  - So from (1,6), possible moves next would be Right or Up (but Up is wall), so only Right.\n\nThis seems a bit limiting; after Up, our only safe move next is Right.\n\n**Option 2: Down to (1, 4)**:\n- New head position: (1, 4).\n- Next possible moves from (1,4):\n  - Left: (0,4) → wall.\n  - Right: (2,4) → check body: current body is (2,5), etc., (2,4) is not in the body → valid.\n  - Up: (1,5) → current neck is (2,5), but after moving down, the body will be [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,3)], and tail moves to (2,2). So (1,5) is the second segment → moving up would collide → invalid.\n  - Down: (1,3) → not in body (current body goes down to (2,3)), but after moving, (1,3) is not in the new body → valid.\n  - So from (1,4), possible moves next would be Right or Down.\n\nThis seems slightly better; after Down, we have two possible moves next (Right or Down), giving more flexibility.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Up and Down, Down seems to offer more flexibility for the next move (Right or Down), whereas Up only allows Right next. Also, moving Down doesn't immediately lead to any dead ends or traps based on the current body positions.\n\n### Verifying for Immediate Collisions\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that moving Down doesn't lead to an immediate collision next turn.\n\nAfter moving Down to (1,4), the new body is:\n[(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,3)], and the tail (2,3) moves to (2,2).\n\nNext possible moves from (1,4):\n- Right to (2,4): not in new body → safe.\n- Down to (1,3): not in new body → safe.\n\nNo immediate threats detected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince neither food is reachable this turn, and moving Down provides more flexibility for the next move without immediate dangers, the best immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

From the current direction, the possible moves are:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (1, 3)\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (0, 4) → x=0 is a wall → invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (2, 4)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of current direction (D).\n\nSo, possible immediate moves: D (to (1,3)) or R (to (2,4)).\n\n### Checking Move Validity\n\n1. **Move Down (D) to (1, 3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (1,3) is not a wall (x=1, y=3 is within bounds, not at borders or (3,2)).\n     - Body: Check if (1,3) is in snake's body.\n       - Snake body segments: from (1,5) to (2,2). (1,3) is not in the list → safe.\n   - Food at (1,3)?

No → just move.\n\nBoth moves are safe. Now, let's consider food and potential future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\n1. **Food at (5,2)**:\n   - Current position: (1,4). Distance is |5-1| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n   - Life_span = 6. It will disappear after 6 turns (including current).\n   - To reach it, need at least 6 moves (since Manhattan distance is 6).\n   - But life_span is exactly 6, so if we start moving towards it now, it will disappear at the same time we reach it → cannot eat it.\n   - **Conclusion**: Not worth pursuing (5,2).\n\n2. **Food at (3,6)**:\n   - Current position: (1,4). Distance is |3-1| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n   - Life_span = 9. It will disappear after 9 turns.\n   - Need at least 4 moves to reach it.\n   - Possible path: Right to (2,4), then Up to (2,5), then Right to (3,5), then Up to (3,6).\n     - But (2,5) is part of the snake's body → collision if we go to (2,5).\n   - Alternative path: Down to (1,3), then Right to (2,3), then Up to (2,4), then Right to (3,4), then Up to (3,5), then Up to (3,6).\n     - This takes 6 moves, which is within life_span of 9.\n   - **Conclusion**: Possible to reach (3,6) within life_span.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is adjacent to the tail and is positive:\n- Tail is at (2,2).\n- Adjacent to tail: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n  - (3,2) is a wall.\n  - (2,1): no food.\n  - (1,2): no food.\n  - (2,3): no food.\n- No immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision Between D and R\n\nFrom current position (1,4):\n\n1. **Move Down (D) to (1,3)**:\n   - Next moves could be Right to (2,3), then Up to (2,4), etc., towards (3,6).\n   - This seems like a longer path to (3,6).\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (2,4)**:\n   - Next move could be Up to (2,5), but (2,5) is body → collision.\n   - So next would have to be Right to (3,4), then Up to (3,5), then Up to (3,6).\n   - This is a more direct path to (3,6).\n\nBetween the two, moving Right seems more direct towards the positive food at (3,6).\n\n### Verifying Move Right (R)\n\n- After R to (2,4):\n  - Next turn, cannot move Left (opposite of R), so options: U, D, R.\n    - U to (2,5): body collision (snake has (1,5), (2,5), etc.).\n    - D to (2,3): safe.\n    - R to (3,4): safe.\n  - Best next move would be R to (3,4), then U to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n\nThis path is valid and reaches the food in 4 moves (R, R, U, U), well within life_span of 9.\n\n### Checking Immediate Safety of R\n\n- Moving R to (2,4):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not in body.\n  - No food at (2,4) → no immediate eating.\n  - Safe move.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Move Down (D)\n\n- Moving D to (1,3):\n  - Next moves could be R to (2,3), then U to (2,4), then R to (3,4), etc.\n  - This is a longer path to (3,6), taking more turns.\n  - Less efficient than moving R first.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Right (R) to (2,4) is the better immediate action to start heading towards the positive food at (3,6) efficiently.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail:\n   - Head: (2, 4)\n   - Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)]\n   - Current direction: Right (R)\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5, 2): Value = 1, Life Span = 5\n   - (3, 6): Value = 1, Life Span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand the positions, let's visualize the snake's body and the food locations:\n\n- **Head at (2, 4)**: Moving Right (R), so the next position if continuing right would be (3, 4).\n- **Food at (5, 2)**: This is actually part of the snake's body (the 11th segment from the head). According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away (i.e., the snake moves so that (5, 2) is no longer occupied by the body).\n  2. The head then moves onto (5, 2).\n- **Food at (3, 6)**: This is not under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Continue Right (R)**: Move to (3, 4)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: From (2, 4) to (2, 5)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: From (2, 4) to (2, 3)\n\nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (3, 4)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (3, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (3, 4) is within the grid and not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (3, 4) is in the current body positions. Current body positions from (1,4) to (2,1). (3,4) is not in this list, so safe.\n- **Food**:\n  - No food at (3, 4).\n  - Moving right doesn't directly help in eating the food at (5,2) or (3,6).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moving right seems safe but doesn't lead to immediate food consumption.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2, 5)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2, 5)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (2, 5) is within the grid.\n  - **Body**: Current body has (1,5), (2,5), etc. (2,5) is the 3rd segment. Moving here would mean the head collides with the body immediately, which is deadly.\n- **Conclusion**: This move is unsafe due to body collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2, 3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (2, 3) is within the grid.\n  - **Body**: (2, 3) is not in the current body positions.\n- **Food**:\n  - No food at (2, 3).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moving down is safe but doesn't lead to immediate food consumption.\n  - However, it might position the snake better to reach the food at (3,6) in future moves.\n\n### Considering Food at (5, 2)\n\nThe food at (5, 2) is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at (5, 2)). To eat this:\n1. The body must move away from (5, 2).\n2. Then, the head must move onto (5, 2).\n\nCurrently, the segment at (5, 2) is the 11th segment from the head. For it to move away, the snake needs to move in such a way that the tail moves forward, freeing up (5, 2). \n\nGiven the snake's length is 18 (from the positions list), it would take several moves for the tail to move away from (5, 2). Trying to reach (5, 2) now is impractical because by the time the tail moves, the food's life span might expire (current life span is 5, and it decreases each turn).\n\n### Considering Food at (3, 6)\n\nThis food is at (3, 6), not under the snake's body. To reach it:\n- From (2, 4), possible paths:\n  - Right to (3,4), then Up to (3,5), then Up to (3,6): But (3,5) is part of the body (4th segment), so moving to (3,5) would collide.\n  - Up to (2,5): Collides with body as seen earlier.\n  - Down to (2,3), then Right to (3,3), then Up to (3,4), then Up to (3,5), then Up to (3,6): This is longer and still risks collision at (3,5).\n\nGiven the current position, reaching (3,6) seems difficult without colliding with the body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (2,1).\n- Head is at (2,4). The distance is |2-2| + |4-1| = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So, this rule doesn't currently apply.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,4) is safe but doesn't lead to food.\n- Moving Up (U) is unsafe due to collision.\n- Moving Down (D) is safe and may position the snake better for future moves, though no immediate food.\n\nGiven that the food at (5,2) is under the body and hard to reach before it expires, and (3,6) is also hard to reach safely, the safest immediate move is to go Down (D) to (2,3), avoiding any immediate danger and keeping options open for future moves.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Scanning the list, it's not.\n     - So, D is a possible move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (1, 3)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall: x=1 is not a border, y=3 is not a border, no internal wall at (1, 3).\n     - Not in snake's body: Scanning, (1, 3) is not in the list.\n     - So, L is possible.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (3, 3)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall: x=3 is not a border, y=3 is not a border, internal wall is at (3, 2), not (3, 3).\n     - Not in snake's body: Scanning, (3, 3) is not in the list.\n     - So, R is possible.\n\nSo, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if we can reach any:\n\n1. **(5, 2)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life span: 4\n   - Current position: head at (2, 3), food at (5, 2).\n   - Distance: |5-2| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 (Manhattan distance).\n   - To reach (5, 2) from (2, 3), need to move right and down.\n   - Not immediately adjacent, so not reachable in one move.\n\n2. **(3, 6)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life span: 7\n   - Position: (3, 6)\n   - Distance: |3-2| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Need to move right and up.\n   - Not adjacent.\n\n3. **(2, 5)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life span: 10\n   - Position: (2, 5)\n   - Distance: |2-2| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n   - Currently at (2, 3), food at (2, 5).\n   - To reach (2, 5), need to move up twice.\n   - But current direction is D (down), and we cannot reverse to U immediately.\n   - So, cannot move towards this food directly now.\n\nNone of the food is immediately adjacent to the head, so no immediate eating opportunity in the next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrent tail position: last segment is (3, 1).\nIs the head adjacent to the tail?\nHead: (2, 3), tail: (3, 1).\nDistance: |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\nSo, no danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, our priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive while moving towards potential food.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (2, 2)\n   - Next possible moves from (2, 2):\n     - Current direction would be D, so cannot go U.\n     - Can go D (2, 1) - but y=1 is not a wall, and (2,1) is not in snake's body.\n     - Can go L (1, 2) - check: (1,2) is not in snake's body, not a wall.\n     - Can go R (3, 2) - but (3,2) is a wall, so cannot.\n   - So from (2,2), possible moves would be D or L.\n   - Moving D now keeps options open.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (1, 3)\n   - Next possible moves from (1, 3):\n     - Current direction would be L, so cannot go R.\n     - Can go U (1,4) - but (1,4) is in snake's body (second segment), so cannot.\n     - Can go D (1,2) - not in body, not wall.\n     - Can go L (0,3) - x=0 is wall, cannot.\n   - So only D is possible next move, which might limit options.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (3, 3)\n   - Next possible moves from (3, 3):\n     - Current direction would be R, so cannot go L.\n     - Can go U (3,4) - not in body, not wall.\n     - Can go D (3,2) - wall, cannot.\n     - Can go R (4,3) - not in body, not wall.\n   - So U or R possible next moves, which is okay.\n\nBetween D and R, both seem safe. L is more restrictive next move.\n\nNow, let's see if one leads closer to food:\n\n- (5,2): from (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is towards it.\n- (3,6): moving R then U could help.\n- (2,5): cannot move towards it now.\n\nMoving R seems to align better with future food access.\n\n### Verifying Collision After Move\n\nIf we choose R to (3,3):\n\n- New head: (3,3)\n- Tail is at (3,1), which will move to (4,1) (since the second last segment is (4,1), and tail follows).\n- So new body: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,4), ... , (4,1)]\n- Check if (3,3) collides with any body part after tail moves:\n  - (2,3) is the next segment, not same as (3,3).\n  - Rest are further away.\n- No collision.\n\nSimilarly for D to (2,2):\n\n- New head: (2,2)\n- Tail moves to (4,1)\n- Body: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), ... , (4,1)]\n- No collision.\n\nBoth are safe.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween D and R, R seems better as it moves towards some food (5,2) and (3,6), while D doesn't provide a clear advantage.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

To reach (5,2):\n     - Path: Right to (4,3), then Down to (4,2), then Right to (5,2).\n     - But (4,2) is not blocked, but (5,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body (part of the tail).\n     - **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head moves to (5,2) when the tail is there, the snake will grow, and the new tail will be at (5,2), causing the head to collide with the body in the next move.\n     - So, eating (5,2) is dangerous — avoid paths leading to it now.\n\n2. **Food at (3, 6)**:\n   - From (3,3), path: Up to (3,4), Up to (3,5), Up to (3,6).\n   - (3,5) is part of the body — cannot move there directly.\n   - Alternative path: Right to (4,3), Up to (4,4), Left to (3,4), Up to (3,5), Up to (3,6).\n     - But (3,5) is body — cannot go there.\n   - Seems currently inaccessible directly.\n\n3. **Food at (2, 5)**:\n   - From (3,3), path: Left to (2,3), Up to (2,4), Up to (2,5).\n     - But Left is opposite to current direction (R) — invalid.\n   - Alternative: Up to (3,4), Left to (2,4), Up to (2,5).\n     - (2,4) is body — cannot move there.\n   - Currently inaccessible directly.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe food at (5,2) is on the tail segment (5,2). If we move towards it, we risk colliding after eating it. Hence, we should avoid moving in a direction that would lead the head to (5,2) in the next steps.\n\n### Best Immediate Move\n\nGiven the above, the safe moves are:\n- Up (U) to (3,4)\n- Right (R) to (4,3)\n\nBetween these:\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,4) opens up more options in the upper part of the grid.\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,3) keeps the snake moving horizontally, but may lead towards the tail food later.\n\nSince moving Up doesn't lead directly towards any immediate danger and keeps the snake away from the tail food, it seems safer.\n\n### Verifying Up (U) Move\n\nAfter moving Up to (3,4):\n- Next possible moves from (3,4):\n  - Left (L) to (2,4) — but (2,4) is body.\n  - Right (R) to (4,4) — safe.\n  - Up (U) to (3,5) — but (3,5) is body.\n  - Down (D) to (3,3) — opposite of Up, invalid.\n  \nSo, only Right (R) is valid next move, which may not be ideal, but currently safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving Right (R) to (4,3):\n- Next possible moves from (4,3):\n  - Up (U) to (4,4) — safe.\n  - Down (D) to (4,2) — not a wall or obstacle, but need to check body.\n    - Body segments after move: head at (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), etc. (4,2) is not in body — safe.\n  - Right (R) to (5,3) — safe (not in body).\n  \nMore options available after moving Right.\n\n### Decision\n\nWhile both Up and Right are safe, moving Right provides more flexibility in the next move compared to moving Up, which would limit the next move to only Right.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list starting from the head to the tail. The head is at (3, 4), and the tail is at (6, 2).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3, 6): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (2, 5): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (5, 3): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's body and the food positions:\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head: (3, 4)\n  - Body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2)\n  \n  This is a long snake with many turns. The head is at (3,4), moving left, which means it's coming from the right (since the previous position is (4,4)).\n\n- **Food Positions**:\n  - (3,6): Above the head's current position (since y increases upwards).\n  - (2,5): To the left and slightly above the head.\n  - (5,3): To the right and below the head.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: The snake is currently moving Left (L), so it cannot move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - **Allowed Moves**: U, D, L\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - Current Direction\n- **New Head Position**: (3,4) + L = (2,4)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=2 is not a border wall, and (2,4) is not an internal wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (2,4) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments after head: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), ... \n    - (2,4) is the 6th segment (counting from head as 0). But since the tail moves forward, the current tail is at (6,2), and the segment at (2,4) will move when the head moves.\n    - **Tail Movement**: The tail is at (6,2). When the head moves to (2,4), the tail will move from (6,2) to the next segment in the body sequence, which is (5,2) (assuming the body follows the head's movement).\n    - However, the segment at (2,4) is part of the body, but since the tail is moving away, it's not a collision unless the head moves into a body segment that isn't the tail.\n    - Wait, the body is [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), ...]. Moving left to (2,4) would collide with the segment at (2,4), which is not the tail (tail is at (6,2)), so this is a body collision.\n    - **Conclusion**: Moving Left would collide with the body at (2,4). Invalid move.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- **New Head Position**: (3,4) + U = (3,5)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=5 is not a border wall (since y=7 is the top), and no internal wall at (3,5).\n  - **Body**: Check if (3,5) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ...\n    - (3,5) is the 9th segment (counting from head as 0). The tail is at (6,2), so (3,5) is not the tail.\n    - **Conclusion**: Moving Up would collide with the body at (3,5). Invalid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- **New Head Position**: (3,4) + D = (3,3)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=3 is not a border wall, and no internal wall at (3,3).\n  - **Body**: Check if (3,3) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ...\n    - (3,3) is the 3rd segment. The tail is at (6,2), so (3,3) is not the tail.\n    - **Conclusion**: Moving Down would collide with the body at (3,3). Invalid move.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, all immediate moves (U, D, L) lead to body collisions. This seems like a dead end, but let's double-check:\n\n- **Instant Reverse**: Cannot move Right (opposite of Left).\n- **Other Moves**: U, D, L all collide with body.\n\nThis suggests that the snake is in a position where it cannot move without colliding, which would mean the game is over. However, this seems unlikely given the initial state. Maybe I missed something about the tail movement.\n\n### Understanding Tail Movement\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves forward, meaning the last segment is removed, and a new head is added. So, if the head moves to a new position, the tail segment is no longer part of the body unless it's part of the body elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the body:\n- Current head: (3,4)\n- Next segments: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2)\n\nIf the head moves to (2,4):\n- New head: (2,4)\n- New body: [(2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]\n- Now, check if (2,4) is in the new body after the tail moves:\n  - Original tail is at (6,2), which is the last segment. After moving, the new tail is (5,2), so (6,2) is removed.\n  - The new body has (2,4) at the head and also at the 6th position (counting from 0: head is 0, then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4)).\n  - So the head is at (2,4) and another segment is at (2,4), which is a collision.\n\nSimilarly for other moves:\n- Up to (3,5): (3,5) is already in the body at position 9.\n- Down to (3,3): (3,3) is at position 3.\n\nThis confirms that all possible moves lead to a collision with the body, meaning the snake cannot move without dying. This seems to be a game-over scenario.\n\n### Checking for Food Under the Head\n\nIs there any food under the snake's head that could be eaten if the body moves away? Currently, the head is at (3,4). Looking at the food positions:\n- (3,6), (2,5), (5,3) — none are at (3,4), so no food under the head.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves (U, D, L), each results in a collision with the snake's own body. Therefore, there is no valid move that the snake can make without dying. This implies that the game is over in this state.\n\nHowever, since the task is to provide an immediate action, and all moves lead to death, any move would be equally fatal. But typically, in such cases, the snake would just continue in its current direction until collision.\n\nGiven that, the only possible move that doesn't violate the no-instant-reverse rule is to continue Left, even though it leads to a collision.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",
