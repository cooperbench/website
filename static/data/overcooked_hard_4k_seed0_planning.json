        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 0 (t1=0). We need to plan for the next several turns (H turns) for Alice and optionally Bob. Since we are at the start, we can plan for both players to coordinate.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the reward by delivering soup recipes. The only recipe we have is Recipe 1: 3 onions, which cooks in 5 turns and gives 20 reward.\n\nLooking at the environment:\n- Onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). So we need to get onions from there.\n- Plate dispenser is at (0,2). We need clean plates to serve the soup.\n- Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). We can use either pot to cook.\n- Serving counter is at (7,2). We deliver the soup there.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice at (3,3) holding nothing, facing down (D).\n- Bob at (3,1) holding nothing, facing down (D).\n\nPlan:\nWe need to make a soup with 3 onions. We can use one pot (say the one at (3,0)) and have both players help to fill it.\n\nSteps:\n1. Alice can go to an onion dispenser to get an onion and then put it in the pot.\n   - Since Alice is at (3,3), she can move down to (3,2) (which is a kitchen counter? Let me check the kitchen counter list: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (3,2) is a kitchen counter and is non-empty? But the state says all kitchen counters are empty. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter and is empty? The non-empty kitchen counter section says \"All kitchen counters are empty\", meaning currently no items on any kitchen counter. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, and currently empty.\n\nBut note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? And kitchen counters are non-empty if they have an item? But currently they are empty, so we can walk on them? Actually, the tile type is kitchen counter, which is a non-empty tile? Let me re-read:\n\n\"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and in the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But a tile being a kitchen counter doesn't necessarily mean it's non-empty? Actually, the tile is always there, so we can walk on it? The rules say:\n\n\"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the others are non-empty? Actually, the tile types are listed, and only empty tiles are walkable? Or are dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters also walkable? The rules say:\n\n- Players can move to adjacent empty tiles? Actually, the move action: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So what defines a non-empty tile? The tile types: dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters are non-empty? Or are they walkable?\n\nActually, the rules say: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" So the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the non-empty tile. Therefore, the non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are not walkable. So we cannot stand on them.\n\nTherefore, the grid has:\n- Empty tiles: where players can stand and move.\n- Non-empty tiles: dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters. Players cannot stand on these, but can stand on adjacent empty tiles and interact.\n\nSo, for example, to interact with the onion dispenser at (3,4), we must be on an adjacent empty tile and face it. Adjacent tiles to (3,4) are (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5). But (3,5) is out of bounds? The grid size is not given, but we can assume the grid is 8x5? Because we see coordinates from (0,0) to (7,4). So (3,5) is not in the grid. So the adjacent empty tiles to (3,4) are: (2,4), (4,4), and (3,3). But (2,4) and (4,4) are kitchen counters? (2,4) is in kitchen counter list, so non-empty. Similarly, (4,4) is an onion dispenser? Actually, (4,4) is an onion dispenser, so non-empty. So the only adjacent empty tile to (3,4) is (3,3). Similarly, for (4,4): adjacent tiles are (3,4) (onion dispenser), (5,4) (kitchen counter), (4,3) (which is not listed as any non-empty, so empty?), and (4,5) (out of bounds). So (4,3) is an empty tile? Let's check: the kitchen counters are listed, and (4,3) is not in the kitchen counter list, nor any other. So (4,3) is an empty tile.\n\nTherefore, to interact with (3,4) (onion dispenser), we must be at (3,3) and face down (D) because (3,4) is below (3,3). Similarly, to interact with (4,4), we can be at (4,3) and face up (U).\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,3) and facing down (D). So she is adjacent to (3,4) and facing it. So she can interact to get an onion? But she is holding nothing, so she can grab an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,1) facing down. He is adjacent to the pot at (3,0)? Because (3,0) is below (3,1). But (3,1) is a kitchen counter? (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), ... so (3,1) is not in the list? Then (3,1) is an empty tile? So Bob is at (3,1), which is empty, and facing down to (3,0) which is a pot. So he can interact with the pot.\n\nBut currently, the pot is empty.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n1. Since Alice is already at (3,3) facing down (D) and adjacent to onion dispenser (3,4), she can immediately interact to grab an onion. So at turn 0, Alice should do 'I'.\n\nThen, she is holding an onion. Now, she needs to put it in a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The closest one is (3,0). To put in (3,0), she must be adjacent to it and facing it. The adjacent empty tiles to (3,0) are: (2,0) (kitchen counter, non-empty), (4,0) (pot, non-empty), (3,1) (empty? and Bob is there). So (3,1) is an empty tile? We think so. So she can go to (3,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). But Bob is currently at (3,1). So they cannot both be at the same tile.\n\nTherefore, we need to coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to the other pot at (4,0). Adjacent empty tiles to (4,0): (3,0) (pot), (5,0) (kitchen counter), (4,1) (empty? because not in non-empty list). So (4,1) is empty. So Alice can go to (4,1) and face down to interact.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,1). We can have Bob move to free up (3,1) or we can use the other pot.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob help by also getting onions and putting in the pot.\n\nLet's plan for both:\n\nAt turn 0:\n- Alice: interact (I) to get an onion from (3,4). Now holding onion.\n- Bob: what should he do? He is at (3,1) facing down. He can interact with the pot at (3,0)? But the pot is empty. If he interacts, what happens? The interact with pot: if he is holding an ingredient, he can add it. But he is holding nothing. If he is holding a plate, he can serve (but no soup). So currently, interact with pot while holding nothing and pot empty does nothing? Or maybe he can start cooking? But the pot needs ingredients. So probably nothing. So he should go get an onion.\n\nTo get an onion, Bob can go to (4,3) to get from (4,4)? Or to (3,3) to get from (3,4)? But Alice is at (3,3) at the start, but after turn 0, Alice is still at (3,3) because interact doesn't move. So Bob cannot move to (3,3) because Alice is there.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (4,3) to get from (4,4). How to get to (4,3) from (3,1)? He is at (3,1). He can move right to (4,1) (which is empty), then down? But down from (4,1) is (4,0) which is a pot, non-empty, so cannot move there. Then he can move right again? (4,1) to (5,1) -> but (5,1) is not in non-empty? The kitchen counters: (5,0) is kitchen counter, but (5,1) is not in the list? So (5,1) is empty. Then from (5,1) he can move down to (5,0)? But (5,0) is kitchen counter, non-empty, cannot move. Then how to get to (4,3)? He needs to go around.\n\nFrom (3,1): \n- Move right to (4,1) -> now at (4,1)\n- Then move up? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot move there.\n- Then he can move right to (5,1) -> then up to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot move.\n- Alternatively, from (4,1) move up? But (4,2) is non-empty, so he cannot. So he must go via (3,1) -> (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, non-empty -> cannot. So Bob is stuck? \n\nWait, the tiles around (3,1):\n- Left: (2,1) -> not in any non-empty list? So empty? Then he can move left to (2,1). Then from (2,1) he can move up to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is kitchen counter, non-empty -> cannot. Then move down to (2,0) -> kitchen counter, non-empty. So stuck? \n\nActually, let's list the grid:\n\nWe have non-empty tiles: \n- Kitchen counters: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (0, 1), (7, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (0, 3), (7, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nSo the empty tiles are the ones not in these lists.\n\nFor example, Bob at (3,1): adjacent tiles:\n- Up: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot move there.\n- Down: (3,0) -> pot -> non-empty -> cannot move there.\n- Left: (2,1) -> check: not in any non-empty list? So empty -> can move.\n- Right: (4,1) -> not in non-empty list? So empty -> can move.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is empty. Adjacent to (2,1):\n- Up: (2,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot move up.\n- Down: (2,0) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot move down.\n- Left: (1,1) -> not in non-empty list? So empty? Then he can move left to (1,1).\n- Right: (3,1) -> where he came from.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is empty. Adjacent:\n- Up: (1,2) -> not in non-empty? So empty? Then he can move up to (1,2).\n- Down: (1,0) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot.\n- Left: (0,1) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot.\n- Right: (2,1)\n\nSo Bob can go: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> ... but (1,2) is empty? Then from (1,2) he can go to (1,3)? (1,3) not in non-empty? Then to (1,4)? (1,4) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot. Then to (0,2)? (0,2) is plate dispenser, non-empty, cannot stand. So he can go to (1,3) and then to (2,3)? (2,3) is not in non-empty? Then to (3,3)? But Alice is at (3,3) at turn0.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go right from (3,1) to (4,1). Then from (4,1):\n- Up: (4,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot.\n- Down: (4,0) -> pot -> non-empty -> cannot.\n- Left: (3,1)\n- Right: (5,1) -> not in non-empty -> empty? Then move to (5,1). Then from (5,1) he can go up to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter -> cannot. Down to (5,0) kitchen counter -> cannot. Right to (6,1)? (6,1) not in non-empty? Then to (6,1). Then up to (6,2)? (6,2) not in non-empty? Then to (6,2). Then left? Or right to (7,1) which is kitchen counter -> cannot. Then from (6,1) he can go up to (6,2) if it's empty? (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at (5,2) and (6,0) and (7,0) etc., but (6,2) is not listed? So empty. Then from (6,2) he can go up to (6,3)? (6,3) not listed -> empty. Then to (6,4)? (6,4) is kitchen counter -> cannot. Then to (5,3)? (5,3) not listed -> empty. Then to (4,3)? (4,3) is empty. Then he can get an onion from (4,4) by facing up.\n\nBut that's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (4,1) and then we have Alice move away from (3,3) so Bob can come to (3,3) to get an onion from (3,4). But Alice will be moving to put her onion in the pot.\n\nLet's plan step by step.\n\nAt turn0:\n- Alice: Interact (I) to get an onion from (3,4). Now holding onion.\n- Bob: Since he is at (3,1), and we want him to get an onion, but the easiest is to use the other dispenser at (4,4) by going to (4,3). How? He can go: right to (4,1) -> then we need to go up? But (4,2) is non-empty. So he must go around. But the grid is tight. Alternatively, he can go to (3,2) but it's non-empty, so no. Or maybe we can have Bob use the plate dispenser first? But we don't need plates until the soup is cooked.\n\nBut we need three onions. So Bob should also get an onion.\n\nSo Bob at (3,1) can move right to (4,1) (action: R). Then at turn1, Bob can move? from (4,1) he cannot move up because (4,2) is blocked. So he must move right to (5,1) (action R at turn1). Then at turn2, Bob can move up? (5,2) is blocked, so he cannot. Then move right to (6,1) (action R). Then at turn3, Bob can move up to (6,2) (action U). Then at turn4, Bob can move left to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot. So he can move up to (6,3) (action U). Then at turn5, move left to (5,3) (action L). Then turn6, left to (4,3) (action L). Then at (4,3), he can face up (U) and interact to get an onion.\n\nThat's 7 turns for Bob to get to (4,3) and then interact at turn7.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice after turn0 is at (3,3) holding an onion. She wants to put it in a pot. The pot at (3,0) is blocked by Bob initially? Bob is at (3,1) at turn0, then moves away at turn0 to (4,1). So at turn1, (3,1) is free? Because Bob moved to (4,1). So Alice can move down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot move. So she cannot go down from (3,3). \n\nFrom (3,3), she can move:\n- Up: (3,4) is onion dispenser -> non-empty -> cannot.\n- Down: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot.\n- Left: (2,3) -> not in non-empty? So empty -> can move.\n- Right: (4,3) -> empty? Then she can move right to (4,3).\n\nSo at turn1, Alice can move right to (4,3). Then she is at (4,3). Now, she is adjacent to the onion dispenser at (4,4) above her? But she is holding an onion, so she doesn't want to interact with the dispenser. She wants to go to a pot. The closest pot is at (4,0). To put in (4,0), she must be at (4,1) and face down. But (4,1) is currently occupied by Bob? At turn0, Bob moves to (4,1). At turn1, Bob moves to (5,1). So at turn1, (4,1) is free? But Alice is at (4,3) at the end of turn1. She can move down? (4,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot. So she must go around.\n\nFrom (4,3): \n- Move down? blocked.\n- Move left to (3,3) -> but that's back.\n- Move right to (5,3) -> not blocked? (5,3) not in non-empty -> empty. Then from (5,3) she can move down to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. Then move right to (6,3) -> then down to (6,2)? (6,2) is empty (as we thought earlier). Then down to (6,1)? (6,1) is empty? Then left to (5,1)? (5,1) is empty? Then down? (5,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So she cannot get to (4,1) directly.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,3) she can move left to (3,3) and then down is blocked, so left to (2,3) -> then down to (2,2) blocked? (2,2) kitchen counter. Then left to (1,3) -> then down to (1,2) -> then down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1) -> then right to (3,1) -> then down? (3,0) is pot, so she can be at (3,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). But that's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the pot at (3,0) and have Alice go to (3,1) which is now free because Bob moved away. How?\n\nAfter turn0:\n- Alice: at (3,3) holding onion.\n- Bob: moved to (4,1) (from turn0 action: R).\n\nAt turn1:\n- Alice: move left to (2,3) (action L). Why left? Because she cannot go down. Then at (2,3), she can move down? (2,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So she must move left to (1,3) (action L at turn2). Then at (1,3), move down to (1,2) (action D at turn3). (1,2) is empty? Then at (1,2), move down to (1,1) (action D at turn4). (1,1) is empty. Then at turn5, move right to (2,1) (action R). Then turn6, move right to (3,1) (action R). Now at (3,1), facing? She needs to face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). So at turn7, she can face down (if not already) and interact.\n\nBut she is already holding an onion, and the pot is empty, so she can add one onion. Then the pot has 1 onion.\n\nThat's 7 turns for Alice to put one onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is moving to get an onion. At turn0: Bob moves R to (4,1). Turn1: moves R to (5,1). Turn2: R to (6,1). Turn3: U to (6,2). Turn4: U to (6,3). Turn5: L to (5,3). Turn6: L to (4,3). Turn7: interact (I) with (4,4) to get an onion.\n\nThen Bob is holding an onion and at (4,3). He then needs to put it in a pot. The pot at (4,0) is close? He can go to (4,1) to put it? But (4,2) is blocked. So he must go around: from (4,3) to (5,3) then (5,2) blocked, so to (6,3) then (6,2) then (6,1) then (5,1) then (4,1) -> but that's 6 moves? And at (4,1) he can face down to interact with (4,0). But the pot at (4,0) is empty? Or we are using the one at (3,0) which has one onion.\n\nWe can use the same pot (3,0) for all onions. Then Bob should go to (3,1) to put the onion. But Alice is going to be at (3,1) at turn6? Then she puts at turn7. Then at turn7, Bob is at (4,3) and holding an onion. He needs to go to (3,1). From (4,3) to (3,3) -> but (3,3) is empty? Then to (3,2) blocked, so to (3,3) then to (2,3) then to (2,2) blocked, then to (1,3) then to (1,2) then to (1,1) then to (2,1) then to (3,1). That's 8 moves? And (3,1) might be occupied by Alice until she leaves after putting.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nBetter plan: use the pot at (4,0) for Bob and the pot at (3,0) for Alice? But we need 3 onions in one pot. So we should use one pot.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice put her onion in the pot at (3,0) and then Bob also puts in the same pot. But we need three onions.\n\nBut Alice is taking 7 turns to put one onion. Then Bob will put one, then we need a third onion.\n\nWho gets the third onion? Alice after putting can go get another onion. But she is at (3,1) after putting. She can then go to (3,3) to get an onion? But (3,3) is adjacent to (3,4). So from (3,1), she can move up to (3,2) blocked, so she must go around? Up is blocked, so she has to go left or right and then up. For example, to (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). That's 5 moves to get to (3,3) and then interact to get onion, then go back to (3,1) to put: another 5 moves? Total 10 moves for the second onion.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nRevised plan:\n\nAt turn0:\n- Alice: I (get onion from (3,4))\n- Bob: S (stay) or change orientation? But we need to free (3,1) for Alice.\n\nIdea: Bob moves away from (3,1) at turn0 so Alice can come to (3,1) quickly.\n\nAt turn0:\n- Alice: I (get onion)\n- Bob: move left to (2,1) (action L) -> freeing (3,1)\n\nThen at turn1:\n- Alice: cannot move down (blocked), but she can move left to (2,3) (action L) or right to (4,3) (action R). But she wants to go to (3,1). How? From (3,3) she can go left to (2,3), then down is blocked, then left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1). That's 6 moves. But if Bob has moved to (2,1) at turn0, then at turn1 Alice moves to (2,3) -> turn2: to (1,3) -> turn3: to (1,2) -> turn4: to (1,1) -> turn5: to (2,1) -> turn6: to (3,1). Then at turn7, she can face down and interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0).\n\nMeanwhile, Bob at turn0 is at (2,1). He can then go to get an onion from (4,4) by going to (4,3). Path: from (2,1) -> move right to (3,1) but at turn1, (3,1) is free? But Alice is moving and might be at (2,3) at turn1, not at (3,1). So at turn1, (3,1) is free. So Bob can move right to (3,1) at turn1. But then at turn2, Alice is moving to (1,3) and Bob is at (3,1). Then Bob can move up? (3,2) blocked. So he must move right to (4,1) at turn2. Then turn3: right to (5,1). Turn4: right to (6,1). Turn5: up to (6,2). Turn6: up to (6,3). Turn7: left to (5,3). Turn8: left to (4,3). Turn9: interact to get onion.\n\nThen he is holding onion at (4,3). Then he needs to put it in the pot at (3,0). So he must go to (3,1) and face down. From (4,3) to (3,3) (action L at turn10), then to (3,2) blocked, so to (2,3) (action L at turn11), then to (2,2) blocked, then to (1,3) (action U? from (2,3) to (1,3) is left? Coordinates: (2,3) to (1,3) is left. Then to (1,2) (action D at turn12), then to (1,1) (action D at turn13), then to (2,1) (action R at turn14), then to (3,1) (action R at turn15). Then at turn16, face down and interact to put onion.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nWe need a better strategy.\n\nNotice that the pot at (3,0) can be accessed from (3,1). The tile (3,1) is empty and key.\n\nAlice can get the onion and then move to (3,1) in one step if she could go down, but (3,2) is blocked. So she must go around.\n\nBut there's a shorter path for Alice to (3,1): \n- From (3,3) move left to (2,3) [turn1]\n- Then move down? (2,2) blocked, so move left to (1,3) [turn2]\n- Then move down to (1,2) [turn3]\n- Then move down to (1,1) [turn4]\n- Then move right to (2,1) [turn5]\n- Then move right to (3,1) [turn6]\n\n6 turns to (3,1) then turn7: interact to put onion.\n\nBob can also get an onion from the same dispenser? But Alice is at (3,3) at turn0, and then leaves at turn1. So at turn1, (3,3) is free. So Bob can go to (3,3) to get an onion.\n\nHow can Bob get to (3,3) from (3,1)? Normally, he could move up, but (3,2) is blocked. So he must go around.\n\nFrom (3,1) at turn0: we have him move left to (2,1) [turn0 action: L]\nThen turn1: move up? (2,2) blocked, so move left to (1,1) [action L]\nThen turn2: move up to (1,2) [U]\nThen turn3: move up to (1,3) [U]\nThen turn4: move right to (2,3) [R]\nThen turn5: move right to (3,3) [R]\nThen turn6: interact to get onion [I]\n\nThen at turn6, Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. Then he can go to (3,1) to put it. How? From (3,3) to (3,2) blocked, so he must go around: left to (2,3) [turn7 L], then down is blocked, so to (1,3) [turn8 L], then down to (1,2) [turn9 D], then down to (1,1) [turn10 D], then right to (2,1) [turn11 R], then right to (3,1) [turn12 R], then turn13: interact to put onion.\n\nSo at turn7, Alice has put one onion (at turn7) and the pot has one onion. Then at turn13, Bob puts the second onion. Then we need a third onion.\n\nAlice after putting at turn7 is at (3,1) holding nothing. She can then go to (3,3) to get another onion. How? From (3,1) she can move up? blocked. So she must go around: left to (2,1) [turn8 L], then left to (1,1) [turn9 L], then up to (1,2) [turn10 U], then up to (1,3) [turn11 U], then right to (2,3) [turn12 R], then right to (3,3) [turn13 R]. Then at turn14, interact to get onion. Then she is at (3,3) holding onion. Then she must go back to (3,1) to put: left to (2,3) [turn14 L? but she is at (3,3) and does interact at turn14, then at turn15 she can move left to (2,3) [L], then to (1,3) [L turn16], then down to (1,2) [D turn17], then down to (1,1) [D turn18], then right to (2,1) [R turn19], then right to (3,1) [R turn20], then interact at turn21.\n\nThen the pot has three onions at turn21. Then the soup starts cooking. It takes 5 turns to cook. Then at turn26, it is cooked.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate and serve it.\n\nThis is very slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient plan.\n\nIdea: Alice gets the onion and then instead of going all the way around, she can place the onion on a kitchen counter near the pot, then Bob can pick it up and put it in the pot.\n\nFor example, there is a kitchen counter at (2,0) or (5,0), but they are not adjacent to the pot. The kitchen counters near the pot are at (2,0) and (5,0) for pot (3,0) and (4,0), but (2,0) is not adjacent to (3,1) the empty tile.\n\nActually, the empty tile (3,1) is adjacent to the pot (3,0) and also to kitchen counters? The kitchen counters are at (2,0), (1,0), etc., but not at (3,1) or (4,1). There is a kitchen counter at (2,2) and (3,2) and (4,2) and (5,2), but they are above.\n\nAlice can go to a kitchen counter near and leave the onion there. Then Bob can pick it up and put in the pot.\n\nFor example, there is a kitchen counter at (2,2) or (3,2) or (4,2). (3,2) is at (3,2) which is above (3,1) and below (3,3). But (3,2) is non-empty, so Alice cannot stand on it, but she can be at (3,3) and face down to interact with (3,2) if it's a kitchen counter. The rules: interact with kitchen counter: if player is holding an item and the counter is empty, she can place it. But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and currently empty.\n\nSo Alice at (3,3) facing down can interact with the kitchen counter at (3,2) (which is below her) to place the onion she is holding. Then the onion is on (3,2).\n\nThen Bob, who is at (3,1), can face up to interact with (3,2) (which is above him) to pick up the onion, if he is empty-handed. Then he can immediately face down and interact with the pot at (3,0) to put the onion.\n\nBut can Bob interact with (3,2) from (3,1)? (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) (up) and (3,3) (down), and also (2,2) and (4,2) (left and right). So from (3,1), which is below (3,2), he must face up to interact with (3,2).\n\nSo plan at turn0:\n- Alice: I (get onion from (3,4)) -> holding onion.\n- Bob: S (stay) or change orientation to face up? But he is at (3,1) facing down. He can change orientation to up (U) so that he is facing the kitchen counter (3,2) above him.\n\nThen at turn1:\n- Alice: interact with (3,2) to place the onion. She is at (3,3) facing down, and (3,2) is adjacent and below, so she can interact to place the onion. Now she is holding nothing.\n- Bob: interact (I) with (3,2) to pick up the onion. He is at (3,1) facing up, so he can interact. Now Bob is holding the onion.\n\nThen at turn2:\n- Alice: can go to get another onion? She is at (3,3) and can interact to get another onion from (3,4) if she faces down and does I.\n- Bob: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot at (3,0), then interact (I) to put the onion in the pot. So the pot now has one onion.\n\nThen at turn2:\n- Alice: I (get onion) -> holding onion.\n- Bob: change orientation to down (D) and then I? But he can do only one action. So at turn2, Bob can only do one action: either change orientation or interact. So he must first change orientation to down, then next turn interact.\n\nSo at turn2:\n- Alice: I (get onion)\n- Bob: D (change orientation to down)\n\nThen at turn3:\n- Alice: can place the onion again on (3,2) by facing down and interacting.\n- Bob: I (interact with pot to put onion) -> now the pot has two onions.\n\nThen at turn3:\n- Alice: I (place onion on (3,2))\n- Bob: S (since he has nothing to do now, or he can prepare for the next)\n\nThen at turn4:\n- Alice: can get a third onion? But the pot has two, we need one more.\n- Bob: can pick up the onion from (3,2) that Alice just placed. But he is at (3,1) facing down. He needs to face up to interact with (3,2). So he must change orientation to up.\n\nSo at turn4:\n- Alice: I (get third onion from (3,4)) -> holding onion.\n- Bob: U (change orientation to up)\n\nThen at turn5:\n- Alice: I (place the third onion on (3,2))\n- Bob: I (pick up the onion from (3,2)) -> holding onion.\n\nThen at turn6:\n- Alice: free\n- Bob: change orientation to down (D)\n\nThen at turn7:\n- Bob: I (put the third onion in the pot) -> now the pot has three onions, and cooking starts.\n\nThen at turn7, the pot has three onions and cooking starts. It will cook in 5 turns, so at turn12, it is cooked.\n\nThen we need to serve it. We need a plate.\n\nAlice is at (3,3) holding nothing after turn5. She can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nHow to get to (0,2) from (3,3)? Path: left to (2,3) [L], then left to (1,3) [L], then up? (1,2) is empty, but (0,2) is plate dispenser. To interact with (0,2), she must be at an adjacent empty tile and facing it. Adjacent tiles to (0,2): (0,1) kitchen counter, (0,3) kitchen counter, (1,2) empty. So she can be at (1,2) and face left (W) to interact.\n\nSo from (3,3): \n- turn6: move left to (2,3) [L]\n- turn7: move left to (1,3) [L]\n- turn8: move up to (1,2) [U] -> now at (1,2) and she needs to face left to interact with (0,2).\n- turn9: change orientation to left (L) if not already? She came from (1,3) which is below, so she is facing up? When she moves from (1,3) to (1,2), that's up, so her orientation becomes U. Then she needs to face left to interact with (0,2) which is west. So she must change orientation to left (L action) at turn9.\n- turn10: interact to get plate [I].\n\nThen she is holding a plate. Now she needs to go to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup. But the soup is at (3,0), and to serve, she must be at (3,1) facing down, and holding a plate.\n\nPath from (1,2) to (3,1): \n- (1,2) to (1,1) [D] -> turn11\n- (1,1) to (2,1) [R] -> turn12\n- (2,1) to (3,1) [R] -> turn13\n- then at (3,1), she needs to face down to interact with the pot. She is coming from (2,1) to (3,1) by moving right, so orientation is R. She must change to down (D) at turn14.\n- turn15: interact to serve the soup (which is cooked at turn12, so at turn15 it is ready).\n\nThen she delivers the soup and gets the reward.\n\nBut the soup was ready at turn12, and she serves at turn15.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is free after turn7. He can also help with getting the plate.\n\nBut let's stick to Alice doing it.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice and Bob:\n\nWe are at turn0. We need to output actions for Alice for the next H turns. And optionally for Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice and optionally Bob. The answer format is for Alice, but since we control both? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? The boxed answer has \"Turn t: action\", but it doesn't specify for which player. The instructions say: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\".\n\nBut in the environment, we are given both players, and we need to coordinate. The task says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\". So we may need to plan for both.\n\nHowever, the answer format only shows one action per turn, which is for Alice? But then how to control Bob?\n\nRe-reading: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo it seems only for Alice. But then how to coordinate? We must assume that Bob is also controlled by us? Or we can only control Alice and assume Bob is following a fixed policy? The task says \"optionally Bob\", but the answer format doesn't have Bob.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think we should output only Alice's actions, and assume that Bob is following a similar plan or we coordinate by the actions we take.\n\nBut in the current state, we know Bob's state and we can plan for both. However, the answer format doesn't have a way to specify Bob's actions.\n\nPerhaps we are only to output Alice's actions, and we assume that Bob is also being controlled by the same planner? Or we are only controlling Alice.\n\nTo be safe, I will output only Alice's actions, and in the plan, I will assume that Bob is also following the same strategy or we specify his actions in text.\n\nBut the answer format is only for Alice.\n\nSo for this task, we are only to output Alice's actions.\n\nThen how to collaborate? We must assume that Bob is an independent agent, but the problem says \"collaborate\", so we must have a plan that works with Bob's actions.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps for this initial step, we plan Alice's actions and assume that Bob will do reasonable things.\n\nBut in the plan I had above using the kitchen counter, we need Bob to do specific actions.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and we are to help Alice collaborate, I think we must output a plan for Alice that assumes Bob is also following a similar script or we coordinate.\n\nBut the answer format is only for Alice.\n\nPerhaps we can output Alice's actions and hope that Bob is controlled by the same agent? But the problem has two players.\n\nAnother idea: since the task is to \"help Alice\", we control Alice, and we assume that we can communicate the plan to Bob, so we can plan for both.\n\nBut the answer format doesn't allow for two actions.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think we should output only Alice's actions, and in the text, describe what Bob should do.\n\nBut the boxed answer is only actions for Alice.\n\nPerhaps for this simulation, we are only to output Alice's actions, and the environment will run Bob's actions separately? But we are not given Bob's policy.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking back: \"Your Task: At turn \\( t_1 \\), plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) over next several turns\"\n\nAnd in the answer format, it's for turns, not specifying player, but the actions are for Alice.\n\nThen optionally Bob means that we can also output Bob's actions, but the format doesn't show how.\n\nPerhaps we can output:\n\nTurn t: Alice_action, Bob_action\n\nBut the format is not defined that way.\n\nThe example answer format has only one action per turn.\n\nGiven the instructions, I will output only Alice's actions, and assume that Bob is following a predefined policy or we coordinate implicitly.\n\nFor the plan using the kitchen counter, it requires Bob to do specific actions. If Bob doesn't do them, it fails.\n\nTo maximize the chance, I will plan Alice's actions for the first few turns and hope that Bob will react appropriately.\n\nAt turn0: Alice is at (3,3) facing down, so she should interact to get onion. Action: I\n\nThen at turn1: she is holding onion, and she can interact with the kitchen counter at (3,2) to place it. Action: I (because she is facing down and (3,2) is below)\n\nThen at turn2: she can interact with (3,4) to get another onion. Action: I\n\nThen at turn3: she can interact with (3,2) to place the second onion. Action: I\n\nThen at turn4: she can interact with (3,4) to get the third onion. Action: I\n\nThen at turn5: she can interact with (3,2) to place the third onion. Action: I\n\nThen she is done with onions.\n\nThen she can go to get a plate.\n\nBut during this, if Bob is smart, he will pick up the onions from the kitchen counter and put them in the pot.\n\nSpecifically, after Alice places the first onion on turn1, Bob at (3,1) facing down can change orientation to up (U) on turn0 or turn1? We are not controlling Bob.\n\nAssume that on his own, Bob might not do that.\n\nTo make it work, Alice's actions alone can only do so much.\n\nPerhaps Alice can get one onion and then go to the pot area and let Bob get the other onions.\n\nBut it's risky.\n\nGiven the time, I will output the first few turns for Alice as in the efficient plan, and assume that Bob will do the right thing.\n\nSo for turns 0 to 5 for Alice:\n\nTurn 0: I  # get onion\nTurn 1: I  # place onion on (3,2)\nTurn 2: I  # get second onion\nTurn 3: I  # place second onion on (3,2)\nTurn 4: I  # get third onion\nTurn 5: I  # place third onion on (3,2)\n\nThen after that, she can go for the plate.\n\nBut in this case, the onions are on the kitchen counter at (3,2), and if Bob doesn't pick them up, they are wasted.\n\nHopefully, Bob at (3,1) will see the onion and pick it up.\n\nSpecifically, after Alice places the first onion at turn1, on turn1 Bob can, if he is facing up, interact to pick it up. But at turn0, Bob is facing down. So on turn0, if we could have Bob change orientation, we can't.\n\nPerhaps on turn0, Bob might do nothing or move.\n\nTo be safe, after placing the first onion, Alice can wait or something.\n\nBut let's output Alice's actions for 6 turns.\n\nThen she can start moving to get the plate.\n\nSo for the first 6 turns:\n\nTurn 0: I\nTurn 1: I\nTurn 2: I\nTurn 3: I\nTurn 4: I\nTurn 5: I\n\nThen at turn6, Alice is at (3,3) holding nothing (after placing the third onion). Then she can head to the plate dispenser.\n\nAction for turn6: move left to (2,3) [L]\nTurn7: move left to (1,3) [L]\nTurn8: move up to (1,2) [U]  # now at (1,2)\nTurn9: change orientation to left [L]  # to face (0,2)\nTurn10: interact to get plate [I]\n\nThen she has a plate.\n\nThen she needs to go to the pot. But the soup might not be ready because the onions may not be in the pot yet.\n\nIf Bob has been picking up the onions and putting them in the pot, then the cooking started when the third onion was put, which could be as early as turn5 if Bob put the third onion on turn5.\n\nBut Bob's actions are not controlled.\n\nAssume that after Alice places an onion, Bob immediately picks it up and puts it in the pot.\n\nFor example:\n- Turn1: Alice places onion1 on (3,2)\n- Turn1: Bob, if he is at (3,1) facing down, he can change orientation to up (U) and then interact to pick up. But he can only do one action per turn. So on turn1, Bob can change to up [U]. Then on turn2, he can interact to pick up the onion [I]. Then on turn3, he can change to down [D]. On turn4, he can interact to put in the pot [I]. So for one onion, it takes Bob 4 turns.\n\nThen for three onions, it would take 12 turns for Bob to put all three.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up the onion, he can put it immediately if he is already facing down? But after picking up, he is at (3,1) facing up. He must change to down to interact with the pot.\n\n So for each onion: \n- Turn to change orientation to up (if not already)\n- Turn to interact to pick up\n- Turn to change orientation to down\n- Turn to interact to put in pot\n\n4 turns per onion.\n\nThen for three onions, 12 turns.\n\nThen the third onion is put at turn13 (if start at turn1 for the first onion).\n\nThen cooking for 5 turns, ready at turn18.\n\nThen Alice can serve.\n\nBut Alice is done with placing at turn5, then she goes for the plate and is at (1,2) at turn8, then at turn10 she has the plate.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (3,1) to serve: \n- Turn11: move down to (1,1) [D]\n- Turn12: move right to (2,1) [R]\n- Turn13: move right to (3,1) [R]\n- Turn14: change orientation to down [D] (if not already)\n- Turn15: interact to serve [I]\n\nThe soup is ready at turn18, so she serves at turn15 which is before it's ready, so she cannot. She must wait until turn18.\n\nSo she can wait at (3,1) or do something else.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nGiven the complexity, and the fact that we are to output only Alice's actions, I will output the first few turns as above.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 0: I\nTurn 1: I\nTurn 2: I\nTurn 3: I\nTurn 4: I\nTurn 5: I\nTurn 6: L  # move left to (2,3)\nTurn 7: L  # move left to (1,3)\nTurn 8: U  # move up to (1,2)\nTurn 9: L  # change orientation to left\nTurn 10: I  # interact to get plate\nTurn 11: D  # move down to (1,1)\nTurn 12: R  # move right to (2,1)\nTurn 13: R  # move right to (3,1)\nTurn 14: D  # change orientation to down\nTurn 15: I  # interact to serve (if soup is ready)\n\nBut the soup may not be ready.\n\nTo be safe, we can have Alice wait at (3,1) until the soup is ready, but we don't know when.\n\nGiven the instructions, I think we have to output a sequence.\n\nSo I will output for 16 turns for Alice.\n\nBut the task says \"over next several turns\", so we can choose H.\n\nLet's choose H=16.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: I\nTurn 1: I\nTurn 2: I\nTurn 3: I\nTurn 4: I\nTurn 5: I\nTurn 6: L\nTurn 7: L\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: L\nTurn 10: I\nTurn 11: D\nTurn 12: R\nTurn 13: R\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: I\n}\n\nThis is for Alice.\n\nWe hope that Bob will handle the onions.\n\nIf not, the plan fails.\n\nWith better coordination, but since we can't control Bob in the output, this is the best we can do.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver an onion soup (requiring 3 onions) as efficiently as possible. The plan leverages the kitchen counter at (3,2) for item passing to avoid long detours. Alice will gather onions and place them on the kitchen counter, while Bob (acting independently) is expected to pick up the onions and deposit them into the pot at (3,0). Once the soup is cooking, Alice will fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) and deliver the cooked soup to the serving counter at (7,2). The soup cooks for 5 turns after the third onion is added, so timing is critical.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 0 to 15)\n- **Turns 0-5**: Alice gathers onions from (3,4) and places them on the kitchen counter at (3,2). This allows Bob to pick up and deposit them into the pot efficiently.\n  - Turn 0: Interact (I) to grab an onion from (3,4).\n  - Turn 1: Interact (I) to place the onion on (3,2) (facing down).\n  - Turn 2: Interact (I) to grab a second onion from (3,4).\n  - Turn 3: Interact (I) to place the second onion on (3,2).\n  - Turn 4: Interact (I) to grab a third onion from (3,4).\n  - Turn 5: Interact (I) to place the third onion on (3,2).\n- **Turns 6-10**: Alice moves to the plate dispenser at (0,2) and grabs a plate.\n  - Turn 6: Move left (L) to (2,3).\n  - Turn 7: Move left (L) to (1,3).\n  - Turn 8: Move up (U) to (1,2).\n  - Turn 9: Change orientation left (L) to face the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n  - Turn 10: Interact (I) to grab a plate.\n- **Turns 11-15**: Alice moves to the pot at (3,0) and serves the soup (assuming it is cooked by ~turn 12 if Bob deposits onions promptly).\n  - Turn 11: Move down (D) to (1,1).\n  - Turn 12: Move right (R) to (2,1).\n  - Turn 13: Move right (R) to (3,1).\n  - Turn 14: Change orientation down (D) to face the pot at (3,0).\n  - Turn 15: Interact (I) to serve the soup (if cooked; otherwise, wait with \"S\" in practice).\n\n### Expected Bob's Actions (for Coordination)\n- Bob (at (3,1), facing down) should:\n  - Turn 1: Change orientation up (U) to face (3,2).\n  - Turn 2: Interact (I) to pick up the first onion.\n  - Turn 3: Change orientation down (D) to face (3,0).\n  - Turn 4: Interact (I) to deposit the onion into the pot.\n  - Repeat this 4-turn cycle for the second and third onions (expected deposit at turn 8 and turn 12).\n- Cooking starts at turn 12 (after third onion), and soup is ready at turn 17. Alice arrives at (3,1) by turn 13 and can serve at turn 15 (if soup is ready; adjust with \"S\" if not).\n\n### Key Assumptions\n- Bob follows the expected pickup/deposit cycle. If not, the soup may not be ready by turn 15.\n- If the soup is not ready at turn 15, Alice should \"S\" (stay) until it is, then interact.\n- This sequence focuses on one soup (20 reward) and can be extended for more recipes if time permits.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: I \\\\\nTurn 1: I \\\\\nTurn 2: I \\\\\nTurn 3: I \\\\\nTurn 4: I \\\\\nTurn 5: I \\\\\nTurn 6: L \\\\\nTurn 7: L \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: L \\\\\nTurn 10: I \\\\\nTurn 11: D \\\\\nTurn 12: R \\\\\nTurn 13: R \\\\\nTurn 14: D \\\\\nTurn 15: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1, which requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a reward of 20. There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n\nKey elements:\n\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter at (7,2)\n\nAlice is at (3,3) facing down, holding nothing. Bob is at (6,2) facing up, holding nothing. Action history shows they've been idle or moving, but since pots are empty, no cooking has started.\n\nGame turn is t1=4. I need to plan actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next H turns. H isn't specified, but since cooking takes 5 turns, I should plan at least 5-6 turns ahead to complete a soup delivery.\n\nSince both players are free, we can coordinate to start cooking and deliver soup efficiently.\n\nFirst, to make Recipe 1, we need to put 3 onions into a pot. There are two pots, but since both are empty, we can use one or both. But with one recipe, it might be best to focus on one pot to avoid inefficiency.\n\nPots cook automatically when 3 ingredients are added. Cooking time is 5 turns for this recipe.\n\nAfter cooking, someone needs to get a plate, serve the soup from the pot, and deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nAlice is at (3,3), which is above the pots at (3,0) and (4,0). (3,0) is directly below her, but she's at (3,3), so to reach (3,0), she needs to move down three times: to (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Let me check the tile types.\n\nKitchen counters are at various positions, including (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter, which is not empty, so players cannot walk on it. Similarly, (4,2) is also a kitchen counter.\n\nThe grid layout: let's sketch it mentally.\n\nX from 0 to 7, Y from 0 to 4.\n\nKitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) — that's the bottom row, but (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, so not counters.\n\n(3,0) and (4,0) are pots, so they are non-empty tiles; players cannot walk on them.\n\nTo interact with a pot, the player must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nSimilarly, for dispensers and counters.\n\nAlice is at (3,3), facing down. The tile below her is (3,2), which is a kitchen counter. Since it's non-empty, she cannot move down to it. She can only interact with it if she's adjacent and facing it.\n\nBut she's already at (3,3), and (3,2) is directly below, so if she faces down, she can interact with it, but it's a kitchen counter, which can hold items, but currently all kitchen counters are empty, so interacting might allow her to place or pick up, but she's holding nothing, so she could pick up if something was there, but it's empty.\n\nAction history: Alice did S,S,S,I. Turn t1=4, so actions from turn 1 to 4: S, S, S, I.\n\nAt turn 4, she did Interact. Since she's at (3,3) facing down, and (3,2) is below, she interacted with the kitchen counter at (3,2). But since it's empty and she's holding nothing, nothing happened, I assume. The state says all kitchen counters are empty, so no change.\n\nNow, for her to move towards the onion dispenser or pots.\n\nOnion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). Alice is at (3,3), so (3,4) is directly above her? Y-coordinates: from the list, (3,4) is an onion dispenser.\n\nPositions: Y=4 is the top row? Let's see: onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). Alice is at (3,3), so (3,4) is north of her.\n\nSince she is facing down, but (3,4) is up.\n\nTo interact with (3,4), she needs to face up and be adjacent. She is at (3,3), which is adjacent to (3,4) since (3,4) is directly above, so if she faces up, she can interact.\n\nSimilarly, she could move to other positions.\n\nBob is at (6,2), facing up. (6,2) is a position; let's see what tiles are there.\n\nKitchen counters include (5,2), (6,2)? Kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n(6,2) is not listed in kitchen counters; let's see: (5,2) is listed, but (6,2) is not. Similarly, (7,2) is serving counter.\n\nWhat is (6,2)? Probably an empty tile, since not listed as anything else.\n\nTile types: we have empty tiles, dispensers, pots, serving counter, kitchen counters.\n\nSpecifically, (6,2) is not in any list, so it must be an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (3,3): (3,3) is not in kitchen counters list, so empty tile.\n\nNow, Bob at (6,2) facing up. What is above him? (6,3) or (6,1)? Y=2, facing up, so north is y+1, so (6,3).\n\n(6,3): is it something? Kitchen counters include (7,3) and (0,3), but not (6,3), so (6,3) should be empty.\n\nServing counter is at (7,2), which is adjacent to Bob if he moves right or something.\n\nBob is at (6,2), serving counter at (7,2), so if he moves right to (7,2), but (7,2) is serving counter, which is non-empty, so he cannot walk on it. He must be adjacent to interact.\n\nSo to interact with serving counter (7,2), he needs to be at (6,2), (7,1), or (7,3) and face it.\n\n(7,1) is kitchen counter, (7,3) is kitchen counter, (6,2) is empty.\n\nSo from (6,2), he can face east to interact with (7,2) serving counter, since (7,2) is adjacent east.\n\n(6,2) to (7,2) is east, so if he faces right (east), he can interact with serving counter.\n\nBut he is holding nothing, so he can't deliver anything yet.\n\nSimilarly, plate dispenser at (0,2), which is far left.\n\nTo make soup, we need to get onions to a pot.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlice is at (3,3), which is above (3,2) kitchen counter. Since (3,2) is below her and she can interact, but it's empty.\n\nTo reach a pot, she needs to go down. But (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so she cannot move to it. She must go around.\n\nLet's find a path to the pots.\n\nFrom (3,3), she can move left, right, up, or down, but down to (3,2) is blocked, so she can move left to (2,3), right to (4,3), or up to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is onion dispenser, so if she moves up to (3,4), but (3,4) is non-empty, she cannot walk on it. To grab onion, she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nSimilarly, she can only be on empty tiles.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible moves: left to (2,3), right to (4,3), or up? Up to (3,4) is not possible because (3,4) is dispenser, non-empty. Down to (3,2) not possible. So only left or right.\n\n(2,3): is it empty? Kitchen counters include (0,3), (7,3), but not (2,3), so should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nSo Alice can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nIf she moves right to (4,3), then (4,4) is north, onion dispenser.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3), she can face north to interact with (4,4) to grab onion, if she is empty-handed.\n\nBut she is holding nothing, so she can grab.\n\nNow, for the pots: to access pot at (3,0), player needs to be at adjacent tiles: (3,1), (2,0), (4,0), etc., but (2,0) is kitchen counter, (4,0) is pot, (3,1) is what?\n\n(3,1): not listed in kitchen counters; kitchen counters are (0,1), (7,1), but not (3,1), so (3,1) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) not listed, empty.\n\n(3,0) is pot, so to interact with (3,0), player can be at (3,1) facing down, or (2,0) facing east, or (4,0) facing west, but (2,0) is kitchen counter, non-empty, so player cannot be on (2,0), must be adjacent from empty tile.\n\nSo possible positions to interact with (3,0): from (3,1) facing down, or from (4,0) but (4,0) is pot itself, cannot stand, or from (2,0) cannot stand. (3,0) has neighbors: north (3,1), south none (since y=0), west (2,0), east (4,0).\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, cannot stand, (4,0) is pot, cannot stand, so only from (3,1) facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0): neighbors (4,1) north, (3,0) west, (5,0) east.\n\n(3,0) is pot, cannot stand, (5,0) is kitchen counter, cannot stand, so only from (4,1) facing down.\n\nSo pots can only be accessed from directly north: (3,1) for (3,0) and (4,1) for (4,0).\n\nNow, (3,1) and (4,1) are both empty tiles, as per earlier.\n\nAlice is at (3,3), to reach (3,1), she needs to go down, but (3,2) is kitchen counter blocking the way.\n\nSo she must go around.\n\nPossible paths: from (3,3) move left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? (2,2) is kitchen counter, cannot move to. (2,2) is listed as kitchen counter.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can move down to (2,2)? No, (2,2) non-empty, cannot.\n\nMove to (2,3), then left to (1,3)? (1,3) not listed, but kitchen counters include (1,4), (2,4), etc., but not (1,3), so (1,3) empty.\n\nThen down to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, should be empty? Kitchen counters: (2,2), (3,2), etc., not (1,2), so empty.\n\nThen to (1,1), (1,0), etc.\n\nBut this is inefficient.\n\nSince (3,2) is kitchen counter, she can interact with it from above or below, but to place or pick up items.\n\nBut currently empty.\n\nTo reach the area below, she needs to go to the sides.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) move right to (4,3), then (4,3) is empty, then down to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, cannot move to.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) blocked.\n\nMove to (4,3), then right to (5,3)? (5,3) not listed, but kitchen counters include (5,2), (5,4), but not (5,3), so empty.\n\nThen down to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, cannot.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps go up to the onion dispenser first.\n\nAlice at (3,3), facing down. To grab an onion, she can move to (4,3) or (2,3), but from (3,3), she can directly interact with (3,4) if she faces up.\n\nShe is facing down now, so she needs to change orientation to up.\n\nThen interact.\n\nLet's plan step by step.\n\nFirst, Alice can change orientation to up to face (3,4) onion dispenser.\n\nThen interact to grab an onion.\n\nBut at turn t1=4, she just did interact, which was with (3,2) probably, but since empty, no effect. Now at turn t1=4, we plan for future turns.\n\nGame turn t1=4, so we start planning from turn 5 onwards.\n\nAction sequence for t=5,6,7,... up to H.\n\nI need to choose H, say H=10 or so to complete a soup.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, and we need to add ingredients, etc.\n\nLet's coordinate with Bob.\n\nBob is at (6,2) facing up.\n\nHe can go to plate dispenser or help with onions.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2), which is far.\n\nServing counter at (7,2), close to him.\n\nTo make soup, we need to put 3 onions in a pot.\n\nAlice is near onion dispensers.\n\nSo Alice should grab onions and put in pot.\n\nBut to access pots, she needs to reach (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom her position, with (3,2) blocking, she must go around.\n\nPossible route: from (3,3) move left to (2,3) (empty), then from (2,3) move down to (2,2)? (2,2) is kitchen counter, cannot move to, so she can only move to adjacent empty tiles.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can move left to (1,3), or down? Down to (2,2) not possible, so only left to (1,3) or up to (2,4) but (2,4) is kitchen counter, cannot.\n\n(2,4) is kitchen counter, listed.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves: left to (1,3), or right to (3,3), or down? No, (2,2) blocked, up to (2,4) blocked. So only left or right.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,3), she can move down to (1,2), since (1,2) not listed, should be empty.\n\nThen (1,2) to (1,1), (1,1) to (1,0)? (1,0) is kitchen counter, cannot move to.\n\n(1,0) is kitchen counter, so from (1,1) she can move down to (1,0)? No, cannot.\n\n(1,1) to (1,0) not possible.\n\nFrom (1,1), she can move right to (2,1), or left to (0,1), but (0,1) is kitchen counter, cannot.\n\n(2,1) not listed, should be empty.\n\nThen from (2,1) to (2,0)? (2,0) kitchen counter, cannot.\n\nTo reach (3,1), which is above the pot.\n\n(3,1) is empty, as per earlier.\n\nHow to get to (3,1)?\n\nFrom (3,3), she can move right to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), she can move down to (4,2)? (4,2) kitchen counter, cannot.\n\nMove right to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) empty.\n\nFrom (5,3), she can move down to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, cannot.\n\nMove to (5,3), then up to (5,4)? (5,4) is kitchen counter, cannot.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nPerhaps there are empty tiles below.\n\nList all possible empty tiles.\n\nThe grid: X 0 to 7, Y 0 to 4.\n\nKitchen counters are at specific points, so other points are empty or other types.\n\nFor example, row Y=3: kitchen counters at (0,3), (7,3), so (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) should be empty, since not listed.\n\nSimilarly, Y=2: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and serving at (7,2), so for X=0,1,6,7: (0,2) is plate dispenser, (1,2) not listed, but (0,2) is dispenser, so (1,2) should be empty? Let's see.\n\nTile types:\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2) only\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\n- Kitchen counters: as listed, including (0,0), (1,0), etc., and (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) for Y=2.\n\nFor Y=2, positions: (0,2) is plate dispenser, (1,2) not listed, so should be empty tile.\n\n(2,2) kitchen counter, (3,2) kitchen counter, (4,2) kitchen counter, (5,2) kitchen counter, (6,2) not listed, so empty, (7,2) serving counter.\n\nSimilarly, Y=1: kitchen counters at (0,1), (7,1), so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) should be empty.\n\nY=0: kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), and pots at (3,0), (4,0), so (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, not empty.\n\nY=4: onion dispensers at (3,4), (4,4), kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), so for X=3,4 are dispensers, other X have counters except (3,4) and (4,4) are dispensers.\n\nNow, back to Alice at (3,3).\n\nTo reach (3,1), which is empty.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), and (3,2) is kitchen counter at (3,2), so she cannot go directly down.\n\nShe can go to (4,3) or (2,3), then from there down to (4,2) or (2,2) but both are kitchen counters, cannot.\n\nFrom (2,3) she can go to (2,2)? No.\n\nFrom (2,3) she can go to (1,3), then from (1,3) to (1,2) (empty), then from (1,2) to (1,1) (empty), then from (1,1) to (2,1) (empty), then from (2,1) to (3,1) (empty).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) she can go to (5,3), then to (5,2)? No, (5,2) counter, so to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) or something.\n\nBut (6,2) is where Bob is, but Bob can move.\n\nThe shortest path to (3,1) might be via (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1).\n\nThat's 5 moves, not efficient.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1), longer.\n\nOr directly, but blocked.\n\nAnother way: since (3,2) is kitchen counter, she can place an item on it or pick up, but currently empty.\n\nBut to use it, she could have an item to place, but she has nothing.\n\nPerhaps she can go to onion dispenser first.\n\nAt (3,3), she can face up and interact with (3,4) to grab an onion.\n\nThen, with onion in hand, she can go to the kitchen counter at (3,2) and place the onion on it, for example, to clear her hand or for later use.\n\nBut that might not be efficient.\n\nSince pots are below, and kitchen counters block, she can place the onion on (3,2) then go around to (3,1) and pick it up from below or something, but she needs to be adjacent to interact.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), she can interact from (3,3) facing down or from (3,1) facing up.\n\nIf she places onion on (3,2) from above, then she can go to (3,1) and face up to pick it up, but that's extra steps.\n\nThen from (3,1) she can interact with pot (3,0) by facing down.\n\nBut to get to (3,1), she needs to go around as above.\n\nPerhaps Bob can help with the pot.\n\nBob is at (6,2), which is empty tile, facing up.\n\nHe can move to (6,1) or (6,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) kitchen counter, cannot, or (7,2) serving counter, cannot, so to (6,1), (6,3), or (5,2) not possible, so (6,1) or (6,3) or left to (5,2) not, so only (6,1) down, (6,3) up, or (5,2) not, so only up or down or left/right but (5,2) blocked, (7,2) blocked, so only to (6,1) or (6,3).\n\n(6,1) is empty, (6,3) empty.\n\nFrom (6,1), he can go to (5,1), (6,0), but (6,0) kitchen counter, cannot, so to (5,1) or (7,1) but (7,1) kitchen counter, cannot, so only to (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (6,3) to (5,3) or (6,4) but (6,4) kitchen counter, cannot, so to (5,3).\n\nBob can move to the pot area.\n\nFor example, to (4,1) to access pot (4,0).\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nBob can go from (6,2) to (6,1) (down), then to (5,1) (left), then to (4,1) (left), then he can interact with pot (4,0) by facing down.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can handle the onions.\n\nSo let's divide tasks.\n\nAlice is near onion dispensers, so she can grab onions and bring them to the kitchen counter near the pot or directly to the pot if possible.\n\nBut with the block, she can place onions on (3,2) or other counter.\n\nKitchen counters include (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), all at Y=2, which is above the pots.\n\nFor example, Alice can grab an onion and place it on (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nThen Bob or Alice can pick it up from below at (3,1) and put in pot.\n\nBut Bob is closer to the pots.\n\nBob at (6,2) can move to (5,1) in two moves: (6,2) to (6,1) down, then (6,1) to (5,1) left.\n\nThen at (5,1), he can go to (4,1) left, then interact with (4,0) pot.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,0) pot, from (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is empty.\n\nAlice can grab onions.\n\nLet's plan for Alice first.\n\nAt turn 5, Alice is at (3,3) facing down.\n\nShe can change orientation to up to face (3,4) onion dispenser.\n\nThen at turn 6, interact to grab an onion.\n\nThen, she needs to place the onion somewhere or bring it down.\n\nSince (3,2) is below, she can face down and interact to place the onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n\nSo at turn 7, change orientation to down (if not already, but after interact, she might be facing the same, but orientation changes when she changes or moves.\n\nOrientation: when she moves, she changes position and orientation to the direction moved. When she changes orientation, she stays but faces that direction.\n\nAfter grabbing onion at turn 6, she is at (3,3) holding onion, facing up (since she interacted facing up, but interact doesn't change position, so she is still at (3,3) facing up.\n\nThen to place on (3,2), she needs to face down and interact.\n\nSo turn 7: change orientation to down.\n\nTurn 8: interact to place onion on (3,2).\n\nNow (3,2) has an onion.\n\nAlice is at (3,3) holding nothing.\n\nShe can grab another onion.\n\nTurn 9: face up (if not, but she is facing down, so turn 9: change orientation to up.\n\nTurn 10: interact to grab second onion.\n\nThen place on another counter or same.\n\nBut we need three onions.\n\nBob can help.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can go to the pot area.\n\nBob at (6,2) facing up.\n\nTurn 5: Bob can move down to (6,1). Move down: from (6,2) to (6,1), which is down, so he moves to (6,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 6: move left to (5,1). From (6,1) to (5,1) is left, so move to (5,1) facing left.\n\nTurn 7: move left to (4,1). From (5,1) to (4,1) left, facing left.\n\nAt (4,1), he can interact with pot (4,0) by facing down.\n\nBut pot is empty, so he can add ingredient if he has one.\n\nBut he has nothing.\n\nHe can pick up the onion from (3,2) if it's placed.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is north of (3,1).\n\nBob is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is accessible from (3,1) or (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,1), to reach (3,1), he can move left to (3,1).\n\nTurn 8: Bob move left to (3,1). From (4,1) to (3,1) left, facing left.\n\nNow at (3,1), he can face up to interact with kitchen counter (3,2).\n\nBut in the plan, at turn 8, Alice placed onion on (3,2), so it should be there.\n\nBob at (3,1) facing left, so he needs to change orientation to up.\n\nTurn 9: Bob change orientation to up.\n\nTurn 10: interact to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nThen turn 11: face down to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nBut let's list turns.\n\nFirst, we need to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, after placing the first onion, Alice can grab another.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nSet t1=4, so turns start from t=5.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTurn 5: change orientation to up (to face onion dispenser)\n\nTurn 6: interact to grab onion\n\nTurn 7: change orientation to down (to face kitchen counter below)\n\nTurn 8: interact to place onion on (3,2)\n\nNow holding nothing.\n\nTurn 9: change orientation to up (to face onion dispenser again)\n\nTurn 10: interact to grab second onion\n\nNow she has another onion. She can place it on another counter, e.g. (4,2) or (2,2), but (4,2) is east, she can move to (4,3) and place, but let's see.\n\nSince Bob is going to pick up from (3,2), she can place another there or elsewhere.\n\nTo save time, she can place on (3,2) again, but it might be occupied, but after Bob picks up, it's empty.\n\nBut Bob is not there yet.\n\nIn parallel, Bob:\n\nTurn 5: move down to (6,1)  // now at (6,1) facing down\n\nTurn 6: move left to (5,1)  // at (5,1) facing left\n\nTurn 7: move left to (4,1)  // at (4,1) facing left\n\nTurn 8: move left to (3,1)  // at (3,1) facing left\n\nTurn 9: change orientation to up (to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 10: interact to pick up onion from (3,2)  // now holding onion\n\nAt turn 10, Alice is grabbing second onion at (3,3), so (3,2) is empty after Bob picks up at turn 10.\n\nThen Bob at (3,1) holding onion, he can add to pot.\n\nTurn 11: Bob change orientation to down (to face pot (3,0))\n\nTurn 12: interact to add onion to pot\n\nNow pot has one onion.\n\nBut we need three.\n\nAlice has second onion at turn 10.\n\nAfter grabbing, she can place on (3,2) again.\n\nTurn 11: Alice change orientation to down (if not, she is facing up after interact, so need to face down)\n\nAfter turn 10 interact, she is at (3,3) facing up, holding onion.\n\nTurn 11: change orientation to down\n\nTurn 12: interact to place onion on (3,2)  // now (3,2) has onion again\n\nBob just added onion to pot at turn 12, so he is at (3,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nThen he can pick up the new onion from (3,2).\n\nTurn 13: Bob change orientation to up (to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 14: interact to pick up onion\n\nThen add to pot.\n\nBut this is taking many turns.\n\nAlice can grab the third onion.\n\nAfter placing second onion at turn 12, she can grab third.\n\nTurn 13: Alice change orientation to up\n\nTurn 14: interact to grab third onion\n\nThen place on (3,2) or directly.\n\nBut to add to pot, she needs to go to (3,1), but she is at (3,3), with (3,2) in between.\n\nShe can place on (3,2) again.\n\nTurn 15: change orientation down\n\nTurn 16: interact to place on (3,2)\n\nThen Bob can pick up and add.\n\nBut pot has one onion so far, added at turn 12.\n\nCooking starts when three are added.\n\nBob at turn 14 picks up second onion, then:\n\nTurn 15: Bob change orientation down\n\nTurn 16: interact to add second onion to pot\n\nNow pot has two onions.\n\nThen at turn 16, Alice places third onion on (3,2).\n\nBob can pick it up.\n\nTurn 17: Bob change orientation to up\n\nTurn 18: interact to pick up third onion\n\nTurn 19: change orientation down\n\nTurn 20: interact to add third onion\n\nThen cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so after 5 turns, soup is ready.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate, serve the soup, and deliver.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nAlice can go to (3,1) directly after grabbing onions.\n\nFrom (3,3) with onion, she can move left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? Cannot, so to (1,3) etc., but long.\n\nSince she is holding onion, she can place on kitchen counter at (2,2) or (4,2) if she can reach.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), she can move right to (4,3).\n\nAt (4,3), she can face down to interact with (4,2) kitchen counter.\n\nBut (4,2) is below (4,3), so if she faces down, she can interact.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2) from (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) is empty, she can move there.\n\nLet's optimize.\n\nAlice at (3,3) with first onion after turn 6.\n\nInstead of placing on (3,2), she can move to (2,3) or (4,3).\n\nSay, turn 7: move left to (2,3)  // facing left\n\nAt (2,3), she can face down to interact with (2,2) kitchen counter.\n\nTurn 8: change orientation to down\n\nTurn 9: interact to place onion on (2,2)\n\nThen she can go back to grab another onion.\n\nBut (2,2) is farther from the pot.\n\nBob is at (3,1) or (4,1), he can go to (2,1) to pick up from (2,2), but (2,1) is empty, he can face up to interact.\n\nBut extra steps.\n\nPerhaps both players can work on the same pot.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can grab onions and Bob can get plates or something.\n\nBut let's focus on one pot.\n\nPot at (4,0) can be accessed from (4,1).\n\nAlice at (3,3) can go to (4,3), then grab onion from (4,4) if she moves.\n\nAt turn 5: Alice change orientation to up\n\nTurn 6: interact grab onion\n\nNow at (3,3) facing up, holding onion.\n\nTurn 7: move right to (4,3)  // facing right\n\nAt (4,3), she can face down to interact with (4,2) kitchen counter.\n\nTurn 8: change orientation to down\n\nTurn 9: interact to place onion on (4,2)\n\nThen turn 10: change orientation to up? To grab another onion, but (4,4) is north, so at (4,3), she can face up to interact with (4,4).\n\nTurn 10: change orientation to up\n\nTurn 11: interact to grab second onion\n\nThen place on (4,2) again or other.\n\nBut (4,2) has the first onion.\n\nBob can pick it up.\n\nBob from (6,2) to (4,1):\n\nTurn 5: move down to (6,1)\n\nTurn 6: move left to (5,1)\n\nTurn 7: move left to (4,1)  // at (4,1) facing left\n\nHe can interact with (4,2) from below at (4,1) facing up.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), (4,1) is below, so if he faces up, he can interact.\n\nSimilarly, for the pot, face down.\n\nAt turn 9, Alice places onion on (4,2), so it's there.\n\nBob at (4,1) at turn 7, facing left.\n\nTurn 8: change orientation to up (to face (4,2))\n\nTurn 9: interact to pick up onion from (4,2)  // at turn 9, Alice is placing at turn 9, so it should be available.\n\nAlice turn 9 interact place, Bob turn 9 interact pick up? But they act simultaneously, so it might be that Alice places and then Bob can pick up, or depending on order.\n\nIn Overcooked, players act simultaneously, but for planning, we can assume they can coordinate.\n\nTo avoid conflict, sequence actions.\n\nAt turn 9, Alice places onion on (4,2), so after her action, (4,2) has onion.\n\nBob at turn 9, if he interacts, he can pick it up.\n\nBut he is at (4,1), facing up, so yes.\n\nThen he has onion, can add to pot.\n\nTurn 10: Bob change orientation to down\n\nTurn 11: interact to add onion to pot\n\nPot has one onion.\n\nAlice has second onion at turn 11.\n\nShe can place on (4,2) again.\n\nTurn 10: Alice after placing at turn 9, she is at (4,3) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 11: she grabs second onion, so turn 11: interact grab, but she needs to face up first? At turn 10, she is facing down, so turn 10: change orientation to up\n\nTurn 11: interact grab onion\n\nThen turn 12: change orientation to down (if not, she is facing up)\n\nTurn 13: interact to place on (4,2)\n\nBob at turn 11 added onion, pot has two if he added, but at turn 11 he adds, so pot has one so far.\n\nTurn 11 Bob interact add, so pot has one onion.\n\nThen after, he can pick up the second onion.\n\nAt turn 13 Alice places, Bob at turn 12: after add, he is at (4,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 12: change orientation to up\n\nTurn 13: interact to pick up second onion from (4,2)\n\nTurn 14: change orientation down\n\nTurn 15: interact to add second onion\n\nPot has two onions.\n\nAlice can grab third onion.\n\nTurn 12: Alice after placing at turn 13? Let's list Alice turns.\n\nTurn 9: interact place onion on (4,2)\n\nTurn 10: change orientation to up\n\nTurn 11: interact grab second onion\n\nTurn 12: change orientation to down\n\nTurn 13: interact place on (4,2)  // second onion on (4,2)\n\nBob turn 13: interact pick up that onion\n\nThen turn 14: change orientation down\n\nTurn 15: interact add to pot, now three onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns.\n\nBut we need to get a plate and serve.\n\nBob is at the pot, he can serve if he has a plate.\n\nBut he needs to get a plate first.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFar from here.\n\nAlice is at (4,3), she can go to plate dispenser or Bob can.\n\nAfter adding the third onion, cooking starts, and after 5 turns, soup is ready.\n\nThen someone with a plate can serve from the pot.\n\nBut to serve, player must be at (4,1) facing down with plate, then interact to serve soup onto plate, then take to serving counter.\n\nThen deliver at (7,2).\n\nBob can do that if he has plate.\n\nOtherwise, Alice or Bob can get plates.\n\nLet's include getting plates.\n\nFirst, to save time, one player can get plates while the other handles onions.\n\nFor example, Bob can go to plate dispenser early.\n\nBob at (6,2) at turn 4.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nPath: from (6,2) to (0,2), but (0,2) is plate dispenser, cannot walk on, so need to be adjacent.\n\n(0,2) has neighbors: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2).\n\n(0,1) kitchen counter, cannot stand, (0,3) kitchen counter, cannot stand, (1,2) empty, so can be at (1,2) facing west to interact.\n\nSo Bob can go to (1,2).\n\nFrom (6,2) to (1,2): move left multiple times.\n\nX from 6 to 1, Y=2, but some tiles blocked.\n\n(6,2) to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, cannot move to.\n\nSo must go via other rows.\n\nFor example, to (6,1) then to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nOr to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2).\n\nBoth similar.\n\nShorter: from (6,2) to (6,1) down, then to (5,1) left, to (4,1) left, to (3,1) left, to (2,1) left, to (1,1) left, then to (1,2) up? (1,1) to (1,2) is north, up.\n\n(1,2) empty, so move up.\n\nThen at (1,2), can face west to interact with plate dispenser (0,2).\n\nNumber of moves: from (6,2) to (6,1): 1, to (5,1):2, to (4,1):3, to (3,1):4, to (2,1):5, to (1,1):6, to (1,2):7, then interact.\n\n7 moves to reach (1,2), then interact to grab plate.\n\nBut he can do this while Alice works on onions.\n\nBut Alice needs to add onions to pot, which takes time.\n\nLet's have Bob get plates after the pot is cooking.\n\nFirst, focus on filling the pot quickly.\n\nAlice can add onions directly if she can reach the access point.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,1) via (2,3) - (2,1) - (3,1) or something.\n\nPath: (3,3) to (2,3) left, to (2,2)? Cannot, so to (1,3) left, to (1,2) down, to (1,1) down, to (2,1) right, to (3,1) right.\n\n5 moves.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1) directly, but (4,2) blocked, so similar.\n\n(4,3) to (5,3) right, to (5,2)? Cannot, to (5,1) down from (5,3)? (5,3) to (5,2) not possible, so to (6,3) right, to (6,2) down, to (6,1) down, to (5,1) left, to (4,1) left, longer.\n\nSo shortest to (3,1) is via (2,3)-(1,3)-(1,2)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(3,1) 5 moves from (3,3).\n\nBut with onion in hand, she might not be able to move that far without placing.\n\nBut she can go to (3,1) with onion and add directly.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nPerhaps use both pots.\n\nBut one recipe, so same.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can grab onion and go to (3,1) directly.\n\nBut let's calculate turns.\n\nAssume Alice goes to onion dispenser first.\n\nTurn 5: Alice change orientation to up\n\nTurn 6: interact grab onion\n\nNow at (3,3) facing up, holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to go to (3,1).\n\nMove left to (2,3): turn 7: move left to (2,3) facing left\n\nTurn 8: move down? Cannot, so move left to (1,3) facing left\n\nTurn 9: move down to (1,2) facing down\n\nTurn 10: move down to (1,1) facing down\n\nTurn 11: move right to (2,1) facing right\n\nTurn 12: move right to (3,1) facing right\n\nNow at (3,1) facing right.\n\nTurn 13: change orientation to down to face pot (3,0)\n\nTurn 14: interact to add onion\n\nThat's 9 turns for one onion, too slow.\n\nNot good.\n\nThe initial idea with kitchen counter is better.\n\nLet's go back to the first plan with Alice placing on (3,2) and Bob picking up.\n\nBut with Bob moving to (3,1) by turn 8.\n\nThen at turn 10, Bob picks up first onion, turn 12 adds to pot.\n\nAlice places second onion at turn 12 on (3,2), Bob picks up at turn 13-14, adds at turn 15-16, then Alice grabs third onion, places at turn 16, Bob picks up at turn 17-18, adds at turn 19-20.\n\nCooking starts at turn 20.\n\nCooking 5 turns, ready at turn 25.\n\nThen Bob can get a plate.\n\nBob at (3,1) after adding, holding nothing.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2), far.\n\nHe can go to (1,2) as before.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1) left, to (1,1) left, to (1,2) up, then face west to grab plate.\n\n3 moves: to (2,1), to (1,1), to (1,2), then interact.\n\nSay turn 21: move left to (2,1)\n\nTurn 22: move left to (1,1)\n\nTurn 23: move up to (1,2)\n\nTurn 24: change orientation west (left) to face plate dispenser\n\nTurn 25: interact to grab plate\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nMeanwhile, soup is ready at turn 25.\n\nBob at (1,2) with plate, he needs to go back to the pot to serve.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1): to (2,1) right, to (3,1) right.\n\nTurn 26: move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 27: move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 28: change orientation down to face pot\n\nTurn 29: interact to serve soup (since soup ready, he has plate, so he serves soup onto plate, now holding soup on plate)\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2): (3,1) to (4,1) right, to (5,1) right, to (6,1) right, to (6,2) up, then face east to serve.\n\n(6,2) to (7,2) serving counter, so at (6,2) face east to interact.\n\nPath: turn 30: move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 31: move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 32: move right to (6,1)\n\nTurn 33: move up to (6,2)\n\nTurn 34: change orientation east (right) to face serving counter\n\nTurn 35: interact to deliver soup, reward 20.\n\nTotal turns from t=5 to 35, many turns.\n\nAlice can help with delivery or getting plates.\n\nBut she is at (3,3), can get plates earlier.\n\nFor example, after placing the second onion, she can go to plate dispenser.\n\nBut let's see if we can optimize.\n\nSince there are two onion dispensers, Alice can grab onions quickly.\n\nAlice at (3,3), after grabbing first onion and placing on (3,2), she can move to (4,3) and grab from (4,4) etc.\n\nBut still, the bottleneck is the path to the pot.\n\nBob can add the onions to the pot while Alice fetches.\n\nBut Bob needs to be at the access point.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can use the kitchen counter at (3,2) as a buffer, and Bob stays at (3,1) to pick up and add.\n\nBut Bob needs to be there.\n\nIn the beginning, Bob can go directly to (3,1).\n\nBob at (6,2) to (3,1): as before, 4 moves: to (6,1), to (5,1), to (4,1), to (3,1).\n\nTurn 5: move down to (6,1)\n\nTurn 6: move left to (5,1)\n\nTurn 7: move left to (4,1)\n\nTurn 8: move left to (3,1)  // at (3,1) facing left\n\nThen he can wait.\n\nAlice at (3,3) can grab onion and place on (3,2).\n\nTurn 5: Alice change orientation to up\n\nTurn 6: interact grab onion\n\nTurn 7: change orientation to down\n\nTurn 8: interact place on (3,2)  // now (3,2) has onion\n\nBob at (3,1) at turn 8, facing left.\n\nTurn 9: change orientation to up to face (3,2)\n\nTurn 10: interact pick up onion\n\nTurn 11: change orientation to down to face pot\n\nTurn 12: interact add to pot  // pot has 1 onion\n\nAlice can grab second onion.\n\nAfter placing at turn 8, she is at (3,3) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 9: change orientation to up\n\nTurn 10: interact grab second onion\n\nTurn 11: change orientation to down\n\nTurn 12: interact place on (3,2)  // second onion on (3,2)\n\nBob at turn 12 adding onion, so after add, he is facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 13: change orientation to up\n\nTurn 14: interact pick up second onion from (3,2)\n\nTurn 15: change orientation down\n\nTurn 16: interact add to pot  // pot has 2 onions\n\nAlice grab third onion.\n\nTurn 13: Alice after place at turn 12, facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 13: change orientation to up\n\nTurn 14: interact grab third onion\n\nTurn 15: change orientation down\n\nTurn 16: interact place on (3,2)  // third onion on (3,2)\n\nBob at turn 16 adding second onion, so turn 16 interact add, pot has 2.\n\nThen turn 17: Bob change orientation up\n\nTurn 18: interact pick up third onion\n\nTurn 19: change orientation down\n\nTurn 20: interact add to pot  // now three onions, cooking starts at turn 20.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCooking ends at turn 25.\n\nBob at (3,1) can go get plate.\n\nTurn 21: move left to (2,1)  but to get plate, he needs to go to (1,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1) left, to (1,1) left, to (1,2) up.\n\nTurn 21: move left to (2,1)\n\nTurn 22: move left to (1,1)\n\nTurn 23: move up to (1,2)\n\nTurn 24: change orientation left to face plate dispenser\n\nTurn 25: interact grab plate\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nSoup ready at turn 25.\n\nHe needs to go back to serve.\n\nTurn 26: move right to (2,2)? Cannot, (2,2) counter, so move down to (1,1)? (1,2) to (1,1) down, but (1,1) below.\n\nTurn 26: move down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 27: move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 28: move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 29: change orientation down\n\nTurn 30: interact serve soup onto plate, now holding soup\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,2): to (4,1) right, to (5,1) right, to (6,1) right, to (6,2) up.\n\nTurn 31: move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 32: move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 33: move right to (6,1)\n\nTurn 34: move up to (6,2)\n\nTurn 35: change orientation right to face serving counter\n\nTurn 36: interact deliver, reward.\n\nStill many turns.\n\nAlice can get the plate while Bob is adding onions or during cooking.\n\nFor example, after Alice places the first onion, she can go to get plates.\n\nBut she is at (3,3), plate dispenser at (0,2), far.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nOr during cooking, she can get plates.\n\nCooking 5 turns, from turn 20 to 25.\n\nAt turn 20, Alice is at (3,3) holding nothing after placing third onion? In the sequence, at turn 16 she placed third onion, so at turn 17, she is free.\n\nFrom turn 17 to 20, she can do something.\n\nBut cooking starts at turn 20, so during turns 17-19, she can move towards plate dispenser.\n\nTurn 17: Alice move left to (2,3)  // from (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: move left to (1,3)\n\nTurn 19: move down to (1,2)  // at (1,2)\n\nTurn 20: change orientation left to face plate dispenser\n\nTurn 21: interact grab plate  // now holding plate\n\nThen she can wait or go back.\n\nBut soup ready at turn 25, she can go to the pot to serve.\n\nPot at (3,0), accessed from (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1): to (2,2)? Cannot, so to (1,1) down, to (2,1) right, to (3,1) right.\n\nTurn 22: move down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 23: move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 24: move right to (3,1)\n\nAt turn 25, soup ready.\n\nTurn 25: change orientation down to face pot\n\nTurn 26: interact serve soup onto plate  // now holding soup\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,2) as before, turn 27 to 30: to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTurn 27: move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 28: move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 29: move right to (6,1)\n\nTurn 30: move up to (6,2)\n\nTurn 31: change orientation right\n\nTurn 32: interact deliver\n\nReward at turn 32.\n\nBetter than 36.\n\nBut still, from t=5 to t=32, 28 turns for one soup.\n\nWe can have Bob deliver or something.\n\nBut let's see if we can start earlier.\n\nAnother idea: use both players to add onions faster.\n\nFor example, Bob can also grab onions.\n\nBob is at (6,2), onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), far from him.\n\nHe can go to (4,4).\n\nFrom (6,2) to (4,4): to (6,3) up, to (5,3) left, to (4,3) left, then at (4,3) face up to interact with (4,4).\n\n4 moves: to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), then interact.\n\nBut Alice is already there.\n\nAlice can focus on one dispenser, Bob on the other.\n\nBut they need to bring to the pot.\n\nWith the kitchen counter buffer, it might be faster.\n\nBut in the above, with Alice getting plates during cooking, we deliver at turn 32 from turn 5.\n\nH is not specified, but we can plan for a sequence to complete one soup.\n\nPerhaps for H=10, we can't complete, but start the process.\n\nBut the task is to maximize reward, so complete as many as possible.\n\nSince only one recipe, and pots are empty, we can start cooking one soup.\n\nBob can start moving to the plate dispenser earlier.\n\nFor example, after Bob reaches (3,1), he can go to get plates while Alice adds onions.\n\nIn the sequence, Bob is at (3,1) from turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 9, he is waiting for onions to be placed.\n\nInstead, he can go get plates and come back.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nBob at (3,1) turn 8.\n\nGo to (1,2): to (2,1) left, to (1,1) left, to (1,2) up.\n\nTurn 9: move left to (2,1)\n\nTurn 10: move left to (1,1)\n\nTurn 11: move up to (1,2)\n\nTurn 12: change orientation left\n\nTurn 13: interact grab plate\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nThen go back to (3,1): to (1,1) down, to (2,1) right, to (3,1) right.\n\nTurn 14: move down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 15: move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 16: move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 17: change orientation down\n\nNow at (3,1) with plate, facing down.\n\nBut the pot has no onions yet.\n\nAlice is adding onions slowly.\n\nAt turn 12, she added first onion to pot? In the earlier sequence, with Bob at (3,1), at turn 12 he adds first onion.\n\nBut here Bob is away, so Alice places on (3,2), but no one to pick up, so the onion is on counter.\n\nAlice can add directly if she goes to (3,1), but slow.\n\nSo not good.\n\nStick with the plan and have Alice get plates during cooking.\n\nTo reduce turns, use the other pot.\n\nBut same.\n\nOr have Alice and Bob both add to the same pot using the counter.\n\nBut with one player adding, it's serial.\n\nWith two players, Alice places on counter, Bob picks and adds, so parallel in a way.\n\nIn the sequence, Alice places at turn 8,12,16, Bob picks at turn 10,14,18, adds at turn 12,16,20.\n\nCooking starts at turn 20.\n\nDuring turns 17-19, Alice can go towards plate dispenser.\n\nAt turn 16, Alice places third onion, so at turn 17, she is at (3,3) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 17: move left to (2,3)\n\nTurn 18: move left to (1,3)\n\nTurn 19: move down to (1,2)\n\nTurn 20: change orientation left to face plate dispenser\n\nTurn 21: interact grab plate  // holding plate\n\nCooking ends at turn 25.\n\nShe can go to (3,1) to serve.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1): to (1,1) down, to (2,1) right, to (3,1) right.\n\nTurn 22: move down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 23: move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 24: move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 25: change orientation down to face pot\n\nTurn 26: interact serve soup onto plate  // now holding soup\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,2): turn 27: to (4,1), turn 28: to (5,1), turn 29: to (6,1), turn 30: to (6,2), turn 31: change orientation right, turn 32: interact deliver.\n\nReward at turn 32.\n\nBob is at (3,1), he can help with delivery, but after adding, he is free.\n\nAt turn 20, cooking starts, Bob at (3,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to get another plate or help.\n\nBut for one soup, not needed.\n\nHe can deliver the soup if he has the plate, but Alice has it.\n\nIn this case, Alice has the plate and serves.\n\nBob can be idle or something.\n\nBut we can have Bob deliver to save time.\n\nAlice serves at turn 26 at (3,1), then she has soup, she can deliver.\n\nBob can go to the serving counter to receive or something, but not necessary.\n\nAlice delivers as above.\n\nSo for the action plan, we need to specify actions for Alice and optionally for Bob.\n\nThe task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can plan for both to coordinate.\n\nIn the answer format, it's for Alice only, but it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I think we can include Bob's actions.\n\nThe answer format shows only actions for Alice, but it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so perhaps we need to specify for both.\n\nLook: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nAnd \"Answer Format\" shows only Alice's actions, but it might be incomplete.\n\nIt says: \"Where each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\)\" and the turns are for Alice.\n\nBut to coordinate, we need Bob's actions too.\n\nPerhaps in the sequence, we assume Bob is controlled separately, but for planning, we should include both.\n\nI think for this response, I'll provide actions for both players.\n\nOr perhaps the system will control Bob based on the plan.\n\nTo be safe, I'll provide a plan for Alice, and suggest Bob's actions.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother idea: since the serving counter is near Bob initially, he can get plates and be ready to deliver.\n\nBut let's finalize a plan.\n\nStart from turn 5.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 5: U (change orientation to up, to face onion dispenser) -- but U can be move or orientation? Action set: Move (L/R/U/D) or Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) or Interact (I) or Stay (S).\n\nIn the action list, Move and Change Orientation are separate, but in the action set, it's {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so U could be move up or change orientation up? Ambiguity.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Player Actions per Turn: Each player can:  \n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.  \n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.  \n- **Interact (I)**  \n- **Stay (S)**\"\n\nBut in the action set for the sequence, it's given as {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so I think U, D, L, R can mean either move or change orientation, but it's not specified.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps in the context, when the player can move, U means move up, otherwise if blocked, it might be change orientation, but it's messy.\n\nTo simplify, in the action sequence, U means move up if possible, else if not possible, it might be invalid.\n\nBut for planning, we need to ensure the move is valid.\n\nIn this case, from (3,3), moving up to (3,4) is not possible because (3,4) is dispenser, non-empty, so she can only change orientation to up or move left/right.\n\nSimilarly, move down to (3,2) not possible.\n\nSo for Alice at turn 5, she can:\n\n- Change orientation to U (up)\n\n- Move L to (2,3)\n\n- Move R to (4,3)\n\n- S stay\n\nNo move U or D possible.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nIn the action sequence, we specify the action, and it should be valid based on position.\n\nFor example, at (3,3), action U could be change orientation to up, since move up not possible.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nBut in the list, it's the same symbol.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll use the actions as per the set, and assume that when a move is not possible, it might be invalid, so we choose valid actions.\n\nFor Alice at turn 5, to face the onion dispenser, she can change orientation to up, so action U (which for orientation change).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, I'll specify the actions.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nLet's have a simple plan to start cooking quickly.\n\nAlice:\n\nTurn 5: U (change orientation to up to face (3,4))\n\nTurn 6: I (interact to grab onion)\n\nTurn 7: D (change orientation to down to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 8: I (interact to place onion on (3,2))\n\nTurn 9: U (change orientation to up to face (3,4))\n\nTurn 10: I (grab second onion)\n\nTurn 11: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 12: I (place second onion on (3,2))\n\nTurn 13: U (change orientation to up)\n\nTurn 14: I (grab third onion)\n\nTurn 15: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 16: I (place third onion on (3,2))\n\nThen from turn 17, she can go to get plates.\n\nTurn 17: L (move left to (2,3))\n\nTurn 18: L (move left to (1,3))\n\nTurn 19: D (move down to (1,2))\n\nTurn 20: L (change orientation left to face plate dispenser) -- but L could be move or orientation. At (1,2), moving left to (0,2) not possible, so L here would be change orientation left.\n\nThen Turn 21: I (interact to grab plate)\n\nThen Turn 22: D (move down to (1,1)) -- assuming (1,1) empty, move down.\n\nTurn 23: R (move right to (2,1))\n\nTurn 24: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 25: D (change orientation down to face pot)\n\nTurn 26: I (interact to serve soup, if ready)\n\nCooking started at turn 20, ready at turn 25, so at turn 26, soup ready, she can serve.\n\nThen Turn 27: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 28: R (move right to (5,1))\n\nTurn 29: R (move right to (6,1))\n\nTurn 30: U (move up to (6,2))\n\nTurn 31: R (change orientation right to face serving counter)\n\nTurn 32: I (interact to deliver)\n\nBut at turn 32, she delivers.\n\nFor Bob, he can be moving to (3,1) and adding onions.\n\nBob actions:\n\nTurn 5: D (move down to (6,1))\n\nTurn 6: L (move left to (5,1))\n\nTurn 7: L (move left to (4,1))\n\nTurn 8: L (move left to (3,1))\n\nTurn 9: U (change orientation up to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 10: I (interact to pick up onion)\n\nTurn 11: D (change orientation down to face pot)\n\nTurn 12: I (interact to add onion to pot)\n\nTurn 13: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 14: I (pick up second onion)\n\nTurn 15: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 16: I (add second onion to pot)\n\nTurn 17: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 18: I (pick up third onion)\n\nTurn 19: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 20: I (add third onion to pot)  // cooking starts\n\nThen Bob can stay or help, but Alice is delivering.\n\nFrom turn 20, Bob is at (3,1) holding nothing, he can stay or move.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nCooking starts at turn 20, ends at turn 25.\n\nAlice serves at turn 26.\n\nSo with this, we have a plan.\n\nFor the answer, since the format is for Alice, I'll provide Alice's actions.\n\nBut to maximize, we can have Bob deliver or something, but Alice is already doing it.\n\nSo for Alice's actions from turn 5:\n\nTurn 5: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 6: I (interact grab onion)\n\nTurn 7: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 8: I (interact place on counter)\n\nTurn 9: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 10: I (grab second onion)\n\nTurn 11: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 12: I (place second onion)\n\nTurn 13: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 14: I (grab third onion)\n\nTurn 15: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 16: I (place third onion)\n\nTurn 17: L (move left to (2,3))\n\nTurn 18: L (move left to (1,3))\n\nTurn 19: D (move down to (1,2))\n\nTurn 20: L (change orientation left)\n\nTurn 21: I (grab plate)\n\nTurn 22: D (move down to (1,1))\n\nTurn 23: R (move right to (2,1))\n\nTurn 24: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 25: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 26: I (serve soup)\n\nTurn 27: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 28: R (move right to (5,1))\n\nTurn 29: R (move right to (6,1))\n\nTurn 30: U (move up to (6,2))\n\nTurn 31: R (change orientation right)\n\nTurn 32: I (deliver)\n\nThis is for H=28 turns from turn 5, but we can stop after deliver.\n\nSince the task is to plan for several turns, we can provide up to the delivery.\n\nBut for the box, list the actions.\n\nTo save space, perhaps for shorter H, but we need to complete the soup.\n\nSince the recipe is fixed, this should work.\n\nI think for the response, I'll provide Alice's actions as per the format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should coordinate to prepare and deliver an onion soup (Recipe 1) as efficiently as possible. The recipe requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns after the third onion is added to a pot, and yields a reward of 20 upon delivery. Given the current state (turn 4), Alice is at (3,3) holding nothing, and Bob is at (6,2) holding nothing. The pots are empty, and all kitchen counters are empty.\n\n### Coordination Plan:\n- **Alice's Role**: Focus on gathering onions from the dispensers at (3,4) or (4,4) and placing them on the kitchen counter at (3,2) for Bob to pick up. After placing the third onion, Alice will fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) during the cooking period and deliver the soup.\n- **Bob's Role**: Move to (3,1) to access the pot at (3,0). Pick up onions from the kitchen counter at (3,2), add them to the pot, and stay near the pot during cooking. Bob will assist if needed, but Alice handles delivery for efficiency.\n- **Key Optimization**: \n  - Use the kitchen counter at (3,2) as a buffer to avoid pathfinding issues around blocked tiles.\n  - Start cooking by turn 20 (relative to turn 4) to minimize idle time.\n  - Alice fetches the plate during the 5-turn cooking period to be ready to serve immediately.\n  - Deliver the soup to the serving counter at (7,2) for the reward.\n\n### Action Sequence for Alice (turns 5 to 32):\nThe sequence below is optimized for Alice to complete the soup delivery by turn 32 (relative to turn 4). Bob's actions are suggested for coordination but not required in the answer format.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward: 20; cooking time 5 turns. There are no tomato dispensers, only onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), and a plate dispenser at (0,2). Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), and the serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 9. Alice is at (3,3) facing up, holding nothing. Bob is at (4,3) facing up, holding one onion. Both have action histories, but I should focus on the current state for planning.\n\nSince the goal is to deliver soup, and soup requires 3 onions, I need to get onions into a pot. Bob already has one onion, so he can contribute that. Alice is empty-handed, so she can grab an onion or a plate.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Serving counter is at (7,2). Kitchen counters are all empty, so they can be used for temporary storage if needed.\n\nPlayers can only interact if they are adjacent and facing the tile. Alice is at (3,3), which is above the pots at (3,0) and (4,0), but (3,3) to (3,0) is three steps down; similarly for Bob at (4,3).\n\nThe grid layout isn't fully specified, but from the tile types, I can infer some positions. Kitchen counters are at various points, but since they're empty, I might not need them immediately.\n\nLet me sketch a rough grid based on the coordinates:\n\n- Y=4: Kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4); Onion dispensers at (3,4), (4,4); Kitchen counters at (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Y=3: Alice at (3,3), Bob at (4,3); also kitchen counters at (0,3), (7,3), but (3,3) and (4,3) aren't listed as kitchen counters, so probably empty tiles or something. The tile types list doesn't include all positions; it only lists non-empty tiles. Empty tiles are walkable, so (3,3) and (4,3) are likely empty tiles since not listed.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Y=2: Plate dispenser at (0,2); kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2); serving counter at (7,2)\n\n- Y=1: Kitchen counters at (0,1), (7,1); other positions not listed, so probably empty.\n\n- Y=0: Kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0); Pots at (3,0), (4,0); kitchen counters at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0)\n\nAnd Y=4 has onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nAlice at (3,3), facing up. Facing up means towards (3,4), which is an onion dispenser. Similarly, Bob at (4,3), facing up, towards (4,4), another onion dispenser.\n\nSince both are facing up and adjacent to the dispensers above them? (3,3) to (3,4) is directly above, so if Alice is facing up, she can interact with (3,4), the onion dispenser, because she is adjacent and facing it. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) and (3,4) are adjacent vertically.\n\nSimilarly for Bob at (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nAlice is holding nothing, so she can grab an onion from the dispenser if she interacts.\n\nBob is holding one onion, so he can't grab another; he needs to use it or put it down.\n\nAction history: Alice's history is I,I,I,I,U. The most recent is U, which is up. At turn 9, she just moved up to (3,3)? Turn t_1=9 is the current turn, and action history is for previous turns.\n\nThe action history is for the passed turns, with most recent at the end. So for Alice, actions: I,I,I,I,U – this means in the turns before t_1, she took these actions. Since t_1=9, the actions from t=4 to t=8 or something, but it says \"at most 5\", so probably turns 4 to 8 for Alice: actions I,I,I,I,U, meaning at turn 8 she moved up to (3,3), I assume.\n\nSimilarly for Bob: U,L,L,U,I – most recent is I, which is interact.\n\nBob's position: (4,3), holding one onion, orientation U, facing (4,4).\n\nHis action history: U,L,L,U,I. Since he is at (4,3), and orientation U, and he just interacted (I), but he is holding an onion, so what did he interact with? Probably he tried to interact with (4,4), but since he is holding an onion, he can't grab another; interact with dispenser only if empty-handed. So if he interacted with the onion dispenser while holding an item, it might do nothing, or be invalid? The rules don't specify invalid actions, but probably it has no effect.\n\nSimilarly, Alice just moved up to (3,3) at turn 8, I think.\n\nBut for planning, I need to start from turn t_1=9.\n\nAt turn 9, Alice is at (3,3), facing U, holding nothing.\n\nBob is at (4,3), facing U, holding one onion.\n\nNow, to make soup, we need to put three onions into a pot. Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlso, after cooking, we need a plate to serve the soup.\n\nPlates are at dispenser (0,2).\n\nCooking time is 5 turns for the recipe.\n\nSince both players are near the onion dispensers, Alice can grab an onion now.\n\nShe is facing the onion dispenser at (3,4), and adjacent, so she can interact to grab an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is facing (4,4), but he is holding an onion, so he can't grab; he needs to do something with the onion he has.\n\nOptions for Bob: he can go to a pot and add the onion, or put it on a kitchen counter for later.\n\nBut pots are at y=0, so he needs to move down.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can grab an onion and then go to a pot.\n\nBut there are two pots, so we can use both if needed, but since we have only one recipe, and multiple onions, we can make multiple soups, but let's start with one.\n\nFirst, let's get onions into a pot.\n\nBob already has one onion, so he can add it to a pot directly if he goes to one.\n\nAlice can grab an onion and add to pot.\n\nThen we need a third onion, so one of them needs to grab another or Bob can grab after adding.\n\nAlso, plates are needed later.\n\nNow, positions: Alice at (3,3), Bob at (4,3).\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), so Alice can interact to grab onion from (3,4) since facing it and adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can't interact to grab because he has item.\n\nFor Bob, since he has an onion, he should move towards a pot to add it.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nFrom (4,3), to reach (4,0), he needs to move down three times: to (4,2), (4,1), (4,0).\n\nBut (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Tile at (4,2) is listed as kitchen counter, which is non-empty, so he can't walk onto it; only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nImportant: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. Kitchen counters are non-empty, so they block movement.\n\nLet's list all non-walkable tiles: dispensers, pots, serving counter, kitchen counters are all non-empty tiles, so players can only walk on empty tiles.\n\nFrom the tile types:\n\n- Empty tiles: not listed, so all positions not in the lists are empty and walkable.\n\nBut we need to know the grid size. Probably, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4, I think, based on coordinates.\n\ny=4: (0,4) to (7,4), with (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) kitchen; (3,4) onion disp; (4,4) onion disp; (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) kitchen. So all y=4 is occupied except possibly, but all listed, so no empty at y=4? (3,4) and (4,4) are dispensers, non-empty, so not walkable. Similarly kitchen counters non-empty.\n\ny=3: kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3), but Alice and Bob are at (3,3) and (4,3), which are not listed, so likely empty tiles. Similarly, (1,3), (2,3), (5,3), (6,3) not listed, so empty.\n\ny=2: plate dispenser at (0,2); kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2); serving counter at (7,2). So at y=2, (0,2) dispenser, (1,2) not listed? (1,2) should be empty if not listed. Similarly, (6,2) not listed, empty? But (7,2) is serving counter.\n\nList:\n\n- (0,2): plate dispenser\n\n- (2,2): kitchen counter\n\n- (3,2): kitchen counter\n\n- (4,2): kitchen counter\n\n- (5,2): kitchen counter\n\n- (7,2): serving counter\n\nSo missing (1,2) and (6,2), which should be empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly y=1: kitchen counters at (0,1) and (7,1), so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) should be empty.\n\ny=0: kitchen at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0); pots at (3,0), (4,0); kitchen at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0). So all occupied except possibly, but all positions listed, so no empty at y=0 except? (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, non-empty.\n\nNow back to movement.\n\nBob at (4,3) wants to go to pot at (4,0). But (4,0) is a pot, not walkable; he needs to be adjacent to interact.\n\nTo interact with pot at (4,0), he needs to be at an adjacent empty tile, facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (4,0): up (4,1), left (3,0), right (5,0), down none or out of bound.\n\n(4,1) is empty, since not listed, so he can stand on (4,1) and face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nSimilarly, for (3,0), stand on (3,1) and face down.\n\n(3,1) and (4,1) are empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nFirst, Bob is at (4,3), holding onion, facing up. He needs to go down to add onion to a pot.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2), but (4,2) is a kitchen counter, non-empty, not walkable! So he cannot move to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is listed as kitchen counter, so he can't step on it.\n\nHe needs to go around.\n\nWhat are the possible paths?\n\nFrom (4,3), adjacent tiles: up (4,4) is onion dispenser, non-empty, not walkable; down (4,2) kitchen counter, not walkable; left (3,3) is Alice, but players cannot walk through each other, and (3,3) is occupied by Alice; right (5,3), which is not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (3,3), adjacent: up (3,4) dispenser, not walkable; down (3,2) kitchen counter, not walkable; left (2,3) not listed, empty; right (4,3) Bob, occupied.\n\nSo both players are somewhat blocked vertically.\n\nAlice can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) but Bob is there, so she can only move left to (2,3) or stay, or change orientation, but to move, only left is possible, or change orientation.\n\nSimilarly for Bob, he can move right to (5,3) or change orientation.\n\nBut to reach the pots, they need to go down to y=1 or something.\n\nSince they can't go down directly from (4,3) or (3,3) because (3,2) and (4,2) are counters, they need to move horizontally first to empty columns.\n\nFor example, at y=3, (1,3) and (2,3) should be empty, (5,3) and (6,3) empty.\n\nFrom (3,3), Alice can move left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\ny=2 has kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), so only (1,2) and (6,2) are empty.\n\nSimilarly, y=1, all except (0,1) and (7,1) are empty, so (1,1) to (6,1) empty.\n\ny=0 all occupied.\n\nTo reach a position to interact with pots, e.g., for pot at (3,0), stand on (3,1) and face down.\n\n(3,1) is empty.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), stand on (4,1) and face down.\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nBut to get to (3,1) from (3,3), Alice is blocked at (3,2) which is counter.\n\nSo she needs to go left or right to a column where y=2 is empty.\n\nFor example, move to (2,3) or (1,3), then down to (1,2) or (2,2), but (2,2) is counter, not walkable, so only (1,2) is empty at y=2.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) empty.\n\nFrom (1,2), she can go down to (1,1), then left/right to (3,1) or (4,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nAlso, for the onion dispensers, Alice is at (3,3), facing (3,4), which is adjacent and she can interact to grab an onion since she is empty-handed.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (4,3), facing (4,4), but he has an onion, so he can't grab.\n\nBut he can change orientation or move.\n\nNow, for planning.\n\nFirst, Alice can grab an onion immediately at turn 9.\n\nSince she is at (3,3), facing up, and (3,4) is adjacent and onion dispenser, she can interact (I) to grab an onion.\n\nThen she will be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is holding an onion, so both have onions, but we need to get them to a pot.\n\nBut the pots are not directly accessible.\n\nAlso, we need a third onion for a full soup.\n\nSince there are two onion dispensers, and both players can grab onions.\n\nBut Bob is already holding one.\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nAt turn 9:\n\nAlice can interact to grab onion from (3,4). So action for Alice: I\n\nBob is holding onion, so he should move towards a pot. But he is blocked down, so he needs to move right to (5,3), for example.\n\nBob at (4,3), he can move right to (5,3), since (5,3) is empty.\n\nThen from there, he can move down, but to where? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can move down to (5,1)? From (5,3) to (5,2) not possible, (5,2) is counter.\n\n(5,2) is kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move down? No, (5,2) blocked, so he can only move left, right, or up, but up (5,4) is? (5,4) is kitchen counter at y=4, since (5,4) listed, not walkable.\n\nSo from (5,3), adjacent: left (4,3) but Bob was there, now if he moves, (4,3) might be empty, but at turn 9, if Bob moves right, (4,3) becomes empty.\n\nBut (5,3) to left is (4,3), which after move, is empty; right is (6,3), empty; down (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable; up (5,4) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo he can move to (6,3) or back to (4,3).\n\nBut to go down, he needs to go to (6,2) or (1,2), the empty tiles at y=2.\n\n(6,2) is empty, as not listed.\n\nFrom (6,3), he can move down to (6,2), since (6,2) empty.\n\nThen from (6,2), he can move down to (6,1), then left to (4,1) or something.\n\nSimilarly for Alice.\n\nAfter Alice grabs onion, she is at (3,3), holding onion, facing up? After interact, orientation might stay, but she can change.\n\nBut she needs to go to a pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can go to a pot.\n\nFirst, let's have Alice grab the onion at turn 9.\n\nFor Bob, since he has an onion, he should move towards the right to reach (6,2) then down to (6,1), then to (4,1) to add to pot at (4,0).\n\nSimilarly, Alice can go left to (2,3) or to (1,3) then down to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut there are two pots, so they can use different ones.\n\nPot at (3,0) and (4,0), both available.\n\nAlso, for the third onion, one of them can grab after adding, or the other can add.\n\nBut Alice is grabbing now.\n\nLet's plan actions turn by turn for a few turns, say H=10 turns or so, but I need to specify H. The problem says \"next several turns (say, H turns)\", but doesn't specify H, so I need to choose a horizon. Since cooking takes 5 turns, and we need to deliver, I should plan for at least 5+ turns.\n\nBut first, let's get the soup started.\n\nAt turn 9:\n\nAlice action: I (interact with (3,4) to grab onion)\n\nAfter this, Alice holds onion.\n\nBob action: he should move towards a path to the pot. Since down is blocked, he can move right to (5,3). So R (move right to (5,3))\n\nAfter turn 9:\n\nAlice at (3,3), holding onion, orientation U (after interact, orientation might not change, or it does? The action: interact doesn't move, so orientation stays, I think.\n\nSimilarly, move actions change position and orientation.\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if adjacent tile not empty, but changes orientation.\"\n\nBut for interact, it doesn't change position or orientation, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for stay.\n\nSo after Alice I, she still at (3,3), holding onion, orientation U.\n\nBob moves R to (5,3), so position (5,3), orientation? Move action changes orientation to the direction moved, so since he moved right, orientation now R (right).\n\nBob was at (4,3) facing U, move R to (5,3), so now at (5,3), orientation R.\n\nNow turn 10.\n\nAlice at (3,3), holding onion. She needs to go to a pot. Can't go down, so she can move left to (2,3), since (2,3) empty.\n\nSo Alice: L (move left to (2,3), orientation now L)\n\nBob at (5,3), orientation R. He can move right to (6,3), since (6,3) empty. So Bob: R (move to (6,3), orientation R)\n\nAfter turn 10:\n\nAlice at (2,3), holding onion, orientation L.\n\nBob at (6,3), holding onion, orientation R.\n\nTurn 11.\n\nAlice at (2,3), can move down? (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she can't move down. She can move left to (1,3) or change orientation.\n\n(1,3) is empty, so she can move left to (1,3). Alice: L (move left to (1,3), orientation L)\n\nBob at (6,3), can move down to (6,2), since (6,2) empty. Bob: D (move down to (6,2), orientation D)\n\nAfter turn 11:\n\nAlice at (1,3), holding onion, orientation L.\n\nBob at (6,2), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nTurn 12.\n\nAlice at (1,3), can move down to (1,2), since (1,2) empty. Alice: D (move to (1,2), orientation D)\n\nBob at (6,2), can move down to (6,1), since (6,1) empty. Bob: D (move to (6,1), orientation D)\n\nAfter turn 12:\n\nAlice at (1,2), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nBob at (6,1), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nNow, Alice at (1,2), she needs to go to (3,1) or (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (1,2), she can move right to (2,2), but (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So she can only move down to (1,1), or left/right but left is (0,2) plate dispenser, not walkable; right to (2,2) not possible.\n\nAdjacent: left (0,2) dispenser; right (2,2) counter; down (1,1) empty; up (1,3) she came from.\n\nSo only down to (1,1). Alice: D (move to (1,1), orientation D)\n\nBob at (6,1), can move left to (5,1), (4,1), etc. since all y=1 except (0,1) and (7,1) are empty.\n\n(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) all empty.\n\nBob wants to go to (4,1) to access pot at (4,0).\n\nFrom (6,1), he can move left to (5,1), or directly to (4,1) in two moves.\n\nBut (5,1) is empty, so he can move left to (5,1). Bob: L (move left to (5,1), orientation L? Move left, so orientation L)\n\nAfter turn 13:\n\nAlice at (1,1), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nBob at (5,1), holding onion, orientation L.\n\nTurn 14.\n\nAlice at (1,1), can move right to (2,1), since (2,1) empty. Alice: R (move to (2,1), orientation R)\n\nBob at (5,1), can move left to (4,1), since (4,1) empty. Bob: L (move to (4,1), orientation L)\n\nAfter turn 14:\n\nAlice at (2,1), holding onion, orientation R.\n\nBob at (4,1), holding onion, orientation L.\n\nNow, Bob is at (4,1), which is adjacent to pot at (4,0) below. He is facing left, not down, so he needs to face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nFirst, he can change orientation to down, or move, but he should interact.\n\nSimilarly, Alice is at (2,1), she can go to (3,1) or (4,1), but (4,1) has Bob, so she can go to (3,1).\n\nTurn 15.\n\nBob at (4,1), can interact with pot at (4,0) if he faces down. Currently orientation L, so he needs to change orientation to down. Action: D (change orientation down) or move down, but (4,0) not walkable, so he must change orientation to down.\n\nThe action for change orientation is specified as L/R/U/D for direction, meaning turn to face that direction.\n\nSo Bob: D (change orientation to down)\n\nNow he is facing down towards (4,0).\n\nThen he can interact to add onion to pot.\n\nBut at turn 15, he can only do one action, so first change orientation.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (2,1), move right to (3,1), since (3,1) empty. Alice: R (move to (3,1), orientation R)\n\nAfter turn 15:\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding onion, orientation R.\n\nBob at (4,1), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nNow Bob is facing down and adjacent to pot, so he can interact to add onion.\n\nTurn 16: Bob action: I (interact with pot at (4,0) to add onion)\n\nAfter this, pot at (4,0) has one onion, Bob now holding nothing.\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can face down to interact with pot at (3,0), but she is facing right, so she needs to change orientation to down. Alice: D (change orientation to down)\n\nAfter turn 16:\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nBob at (4,1), holding nothing, orientation D.\n\nPot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nTurn 17: Alice can interact with pot at (3,0) since she is facing down and adjacent. Action: I (add onion to pot at (3,0))\n\nNow pot at (3,0) has one onion, Alice holding nothing.\n\nBut we need three onions for a soup. Currently, pot at (4,0) has one, pot at (3,0) has one. We need to add more onions to one pot.\n\nAlso, Bob is at (4,1), holding nothing, he can go grab another onion or something.\n\nBut the pots have only one each, so we need to add two more to one pot to make a soup.\n\nFor example, add two more onions to pot at (4,0).\n\nFirst, since Bob is at (4,1), holding nothing, and orientation down, but he can move or change orientation.\n\nHe can go back to grab an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nNow, to make a soup, we need three onions in one pot.\n\nSo let's focus on one pot, say (4,0) which has one onion already.\n\nWe need two more onions.\n\nBob can grab an onion from dispenser.\n\nBut dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), far away.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can grab.\n\nBut they are at y=1, dispensers at y=4.\n\nAlso, we need to consider the plate for serving.\n\nFirst, let's get the soup cooking.\n\nSince Bob is at (4,1), he can move up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he needs to go around to the sides.\n\nSimilarly to before.\n\nHe can move right to (5,1), then up to (5,2) not possible, so to (6,1), then up to (6,2), etc.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: after adding onions, one player can stay to add more, but they need to get more onions.\n\nPerhaps Alice and Bob can coordinate to both add to the same pot.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, after Alice adds to (3,0), pot has one.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,1), he can move to (3,1)? (3,1) is occupied by Alice, so he can't.\n\nAlice at (3,1), Bob at (4,1).\n\nBob can move up or down, but down not, up not, so move right to (5,1).\n\nThen Alice, after adding, at (3,1), holding nothing, she can move to grab another onion.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nSince both pots have one onion, we can add to one of them.\n\nBut it's better to have one pot with three onions to start cooking.\n\nSo perhaps Bob, at turn 17, instead of staying, he can go to grab an onion.\n\nBut he is at (4,1).\n\nFirst, he needs to go up.\n\nFrom (4,1), he can move left to (3,1), but Alice is there, so he can move right to (5,1).\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can move to (4,1) but Bob is there, or she can move up, but (3,2) counter, not walkable, so she can only move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo she can move left to (2,1).\n\nTurn 17 actions:\n\nAfter turn 16: Alice at (3,1), orientation D, holding nothing after interact? Turn 16: Alice changed orientation to D, still holding onion.\n\nLet's clarify turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: Bob did I, added onion to (4,0), now holding nothing.\n\nAlice did D, changed orientation to down, still holding onion.\n\nThen turn 17: Alice can I to add to (3,0).\n\nSo turn 17: Alice action: I (add onion to (3,0), now holding nothing)\n\nBob at (4,1), orientation D, holding nothing. He can move right to (5,1). Bob: R (move to (5,1), orientation R)\n\nAfter turn 17:\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding nothing, orientation D (after interact, orientation same).\n\nBob at (5,1), holding nothing, orientation R.\n\nPot at (3,0) has one onion, pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nNow, Alice can go to grab an onion for the same pot, say for (4,0).\n\nBut she is at (3,1), she can move to (4,1) now since Bob left. Alice: R (move to (4,1), orientation R)\n\nBut (4,1) is empty now.\n\nThen at (4,1), she can face down to interact with (4,0), but (4,0) has one onion, she can add another if she has, but she has nothing.\n\nFirst, she needs to get an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (5,1), he can move to (6,1), then to (6,2), etc to go up.\n\nTo save time, one player can go for onions while the other stays to add, but since they need to move, it's messy.\n\nAnother idea: use the kitchen counters for temporary storage. But currently all empty, and players can place items on them.\n\nFor example, Bob can place his onion on a kitchen counter near the pots, then go grab another, but the kitchen counters are at y=2 or other places, but not directly adjacent.\n\nKitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), etc, which are not walkable, but players can interact with them if adjacent and facing.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), Alice can face up to interact with (2,2) kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut it might not save time.\n\nLet's restart the plan with better coordination.\n\nAt turn 9, Alice grabs onion (I).\n\nBob, instead of moving right, he can change orientation or something, but he needs to move to reach pot.\n\nSince Alice is grabbing onion, and Bob has onion, they can both go to the same pot area.\n\nFor example, both go to (3,1) and (4,1) to add to (3,0) and (4,0), but then the pots have only one each.\n\nThen one player can bring the third onion.\n\nBut with the path issues, it takes many turns to go up and down.\n\nThe onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), and players are at (3,3) and (4,3) at start, so they can easily access onions.\n\nBut to add to pots, it takes time.\n\nPerhaps one player should focus on onions and the other on plates or something.\n\nBut plates are at (0,2), far left.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum turns to start cooking.\n\nFirst, to add one onion to pot, from (3,3) to (3,1) takes several moves, as above, about 5-6 moves.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBut since Bob already has onion, he can add in fewer moves if he can reach faster.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move right to (5,3), then to (6,3), then down to (6,2), to (6,1), then left to (4,1), that's 4 moves to (4,1), then change orientation and interact, so 5 actions to add.\n\nSimilarly for Alice from (3,3), move left to (2,3), to (1,3), to (1,2), to (1,1), to (2,1), to (3,1), 5 moves, then interact, 6 actions.\n\nBut Alice grabbed onion at turn 9, so she can add at turn 15 or so.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, she added at turn 17.\n\nBut let's optimize.\n\nAt turn 9:\n\nAlice: I (grab onion)\n\nBob: R (move to (5,3))\n\nTurn 10:\nAlice: L (move to (2,3), orientation L)\nBob: R (move to (6,3), orientation R)\n\nTurn 11:\nAlice: L (move to (1,3), orientation L)  // (1,3) to (1,2) down, but (1,2) is at y=2, empty\nFrom (1,3), move down to (1,2): Alice D\nBob: D (move to (6,2), orientation D)\n\nTurn 12:\nAlice at (1,2), move down to (1,1): D\nBob at (6,2), move down to (6,1): D\n\nTurn 13:\nAlice at (1,1), move right to (2,1): R\nBob at (6,1), move left to (5,1): L\n\nTurn 14:\nAlice at (2,1), move right to (3,1): R\nBob at (5,1), move left to (4,1): L\n\nTurn 15:\nAlice at (3,1), orientation R, change to down to face pot: D\nBob at (4,1), orientation L, change to down: D\n\nTurn 16:\nAlice interact with (3,0): I, add onion, now holding nothing\nBob interact with (4,0): I, add onion, now holding nothing\n\nNow at turn 16, both pots have one onion each.\n\nWe need to add two more onions to one pot.\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding nothing.\nBob at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nOne of them can go to grab an onion.\n\nSay Alice goes to grab onion from (3,4).\n\nBut she is at (3,1), to reach (3,3), she needs to go up, but (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she must go left or right to (2,1) or (4,1), then to (2,2) not, so to (1,1) or (5,1), then up to (1,2) or (6,2), then to (1,3) or (6,3), then to (3,3) or (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,1), move left to (2,1), then up to (2,2) not possible, so move to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), then to (3,3).\n\nThat's many moves.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1): 1 move\n(2,1) to (1,1): another, but (1,1) is left of (2,1)? (2,1) to (1,1) is move left.\nThen (1,1) to (1,2) move up.\n(1,2) to (1,3) move up.\n(1,3) to (2,3) move right.\n(2,3) to (3,3) move right.\nThen at (3,3), face up to interact with (3,4) dispenser.\n\nSo 6 moves to grab an onion.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nThen she needs to go back to add to pot.\n\nAnother 5-6 moves.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, then serving with plate.\n\nThis will take too long.\n\nTo save time, one player can stay near the dispensers to grab onions while the other is near the pots, but with the path, it's hard to be near both.\n\nOr use the kitchen counters to pass items, but it might not help.\n\nSince there are two players, they can work on different tasks.\n\nFor example, Alice can focus on getting plates or onions, Bob on adding to pot.\n\nBut let's think about the recipe.\n\nWe need to make onion soup with 3 onions.\n\nBob already has one onion, so if he adds it, and Alice adds one, then we need a third.\n\nBut after adding the first two, the players are at the pots, far from dispensers.\n\nAt turn 9, instead of both adding, one can add and the other can grab another onion.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, Alice grabs onion (I).\n\nBob, instead of moving to pot, he can move to (4,4) but can't, or change orientation, but he has onion, so he should go to pot.\n\nBut he can't go directly.\n\nPerhaps Alice can grab onion and then both go to the same area.\n\nAnother idea: Alice at (3,3) can interact to grab onion, then move down, but can't, so move left to (2,3), etc.\n\nBob at (4,3) can move right to (5,3), then down to (5,2) not, so to (6,3), then down to (6,2), etc as before.\n\nBut to add to the same pot, say both go to (4,1) for pot at (4,0).\n\nFor example, Alice after grabbing, go to (4,3) but Bob is there, so she can go to (2,3), then to (1,3), to (1,2), to (1,1), to (2,1), to (3,1), to (4,1) if empty.\n\nBob go to (5,3), to (6,3), to (6,2), to (6,1), to (5,1), to (4,1).\n\nAt turn 14, both at (4,1)? But (4,1) can only hold one player.\n\nSo they can't be at the same tile.\n\nBob can be at (4,1), Alice at (3,1) or (5,1).\n\nThen Alice can add to (3,0), Bob to (4,0).\n\nThen for the third onion, one of them goes back.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, Bob should not add his onion yet, but put it on a kitchen counter near the dispensers or something.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, Alice: I grab onion.\n\nBob is at (4,3), facing up, holding onion. He can interact with the kitchen counter? But what is adjacent? Up is (4,4) dispenser, not kitchen counter. Down is (4,2) kitchen counter, but he is not adjacent to it; he is at (4,3), so (4,2) is below, but he is facing up, not down, so to interact with (4,2), he needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nHe is at (4,3), (4,2) is below, so he needs to face down to interact.\n\nFirst, he needs to change orientation to down.\n\nAt turn 9, Bob can change orientation to down (D action for change orientation), then at turn 10, interact with (4,2) kitchen counter to place the onion, since he is holding item and counter is empty.\n\nThen he can grab another onion or something.\n\nLet's try.\n\nTurn 9:\nAlice: I (grab onion from (3,4), now holding onion)\nBob: D (change orientation to down to face (4,2))\n\nAfter, Alice at (3,3), holding onion, orientation U.\nBob at (4,3), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nTurn 10:\nAlice can move left to (2,3): L\nBob can interact with (4,2) kitchen counter: I, to place onion on counter. Since he is holding item and counter empty, he places the onion on (4,2).\n\nNow Bob holding nothing.\n\nAfter, Bob at (4,3), holding nothing, orientation D.\nAlice at (2,3), holding onion, orientation L.\n\nTurn 11:\nAlice can move to (1,3) or down, but can't down, so move left to (1,3): L\nBob can now grab onion from (4,4) but he is facing down, so he needs to face up. Bob: U (change orientation to up to face (4,4))\n\nTurn 12:\nAlice at (1,3), move down to (1,2): D\nBob at (4,3), now facing up, can interact with (4,4) to grab onion: I, since empty-handed, grabs onion, now holding onion.\n\nTurn 13:\nAlice at (1,2), move down to (1,1): D\nBob at (4,3), holding onion, he can now go to pot or place again.\n\nBut he has an onion, and Alice has one, and there is one on the counter at (4,2).\n\nKitchen counter at (4,2) has an onion now.\n\nPlayers can pick it up if adjacent and facing.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), Bob is above (4,2), so if he faces down, he can interact to pick up, but he is holding an onion, so he can't pick up; he needs to be empty-handed.\n\nSo to use the onion on counter, someone needs to pick it up.\n\nBut it's at (4,2), which can be accessed from (4,1) or (4,3) or (3,2) or (5,2), but (4,2) is the counter tile, not walkable, so players need to be adjacent at (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), or (5,2).\n\n(4,3) is above, (4,1) below, (3,2) left, (5,2) right.\n\nBut (3,2) and (5,2) are also kitchen counters, non-walkable, so only from (4,1) or (4,3) or (3,2) but (3,2) not walkable, so only from (4,1) or (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), facing down, or from (4,1), facing up.\n\nIn this case, Bob at (4,3), he can face down to interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion if empty-handed.\n\nBut at turn 13, he is holding an onion, so he can't.\n\nHe can place his onion on another counter or add to pot.\n\nThis might not be efficient.\n\nPerhaps it's better to have both players add their onions to the same pot quickly.\n\nBut with the layout, it's difficult.\n\nAnother idea: use the pot at (3,0) or (4,0), and have one player add onions while the other gets plates.\n\nPlates are at (0,2).\n\nAt turn 9, Alice grabs onion (I).\n\nBob, since he has onion, he can go directly to add to pot, say to (4,0) via (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) as before.\n\nAlice after grabbing, she can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2), she is at (3,3), so she can move left to (2,3), to (1,3), to (1,2), then at (1,2), she is adjacent to (0,2) left, so if she faces left, she can interact to grab plate.\n\nBut she is holding onion, so she can't grab plate; she needs to be empty-handed.\n\nFirst, she needs to put down the onion or add to pot.\n\nSo she can add the onion to a pot first or put on counter.\n\nLet's accept that it takes time and plan for the soup.\n\nAssume we add three onions to pot at (4,0).\n\nAt turn 16, as before, pot at (4,0) has one onion from Bob.\n\nAlice added to (3,0) at turn 17, but let's have Alice add to (4,0) instead.\n\nFrom turn 16: after Bob added to (4,0) at turn 16, pot has one onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding onion, orientation D.\n\nShe can move right to (4,1), but at turn 16, Bob is at (4,1), so she can't.\n\nAt turn 16, after actions:\n\nTurn 15: Alice at (3,1) orientation R, she changed to D.\n\nBob at (4,1) orientation L, changed to D.\n\nTurn 16: Alice I with (3,0), added to (3,0), holding nothing.\n\nBob I with (4,0), added to (4,0), holding nothing.\n\nSo at turn 16, both holding nothing, Alice at (3,1), Bob at (4,1).\n\nPot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nNow, Alice can move to (4,1) but occupied, so she can move to (5,1) or (2,1).\n\nSay she moves to (4,1) but occupied, so move to (5,1): R (move right to (5,1), orientation R)\n\nBob can stay or move.\n\nThen turn 17: Alice at (5,1), orientation R.\n\nBob at (4,1), orientation D.\n\nBob can go grab an onion. First, he needs to go up.\n\nBob move right to (5,1) but Alice there, so move to (6,1): R (move to (6,1), orientation R)\n\nAlice at (5,1), she can move to (6,1) not, or to (5,2) not, so move to (4,1) now empty, Alice: L (move left to (4,1), orientation L)\n\nMessy.\n\nBob at (4,1) can move up, but can't, so move right to (5,1): R\n\nAlice at (5,1) can move to (6,1): R\n\nTurn 17:\nBob: R to (5,1)\nAlice: R to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 18:\nBob at (5,1), move to (6,1) but Alice there, so move to (6,2) not, so he can move up? not, so only move to (6,1) occupied, or stay, or change orientation.\n\nHe can move to (6,1) but occupied, so he can only move to (5,2) not possible, so stay or change orientation.\n\nSo Bob: S (stay) or change orientation.\n\nBut he needs to go up, so from (5,1), move to (6,1) if possible, but occupied, so he must wait or Alice moves.\n\nAlice at (6,1), can move up to (6,2): U (move to (6,2), orientation U)\n\nThen Bob at (5,1), can move to (6,1): R\n\nTurn 18:\nAlice: U to (6,2)\nBob: R to (6,1)\n\nAfter, Alice at (6,2), orientation U.\nBob at (6,1), orientation R.\n\nThen turn 19:\nAlice at (6,2), can move up to (6,3): U\nBob at (6,1), can move up to (6,2) but Alice there, so he can only move left to (5,1) or right out, or stay.\n\nBob: L to (5,1)\n\nAnd so on. This is taking too long, and we haven't added the second onion yet.\n\nTo save time, let's have Alice at turn 16 after adding to (3,0), she is at (3,1), holding nothing. Instead of moving, she can change orientation to up or something, but she needs to go grab onion.\n\nShe can move left to (2,1): L\n\nThen to (1,1), then to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut let's give up and plan for a shorter horizon or assume a different strategy.\n\nPerhaps for the third onion, since Bob is at (4,1), he can go to the kitchen counter at (4,2) but he is below, so from (4,1), he can face up to interact with (4,2), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, and if it has an item, he can pick up, but in this case, it's empty unless we placed something.\n\nIn the current state, all kitchen counters are empty, so no item to pick up.\n\nSo not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, at turn 9, Alice grabs onion (I).\n\nBob, instead of moving, he can change orientation to down (D), then at turn 10, interact with (4,2) to place the onion on the counter.\n\nThen at turn 11, he can change orientation to up (U), then interact with (4,4) to grab another onion.\n\nThen he has an onion, and there is an onion on the counter at (4,2).\n\nThen Alice has an onion, she can add to a pot or put on counter.\n\nBut adding to pot takes time.\n\nThen from the counter, someone can pick up the onion to add to pot.\n\nBut it might not save turns.\n\nI think for the sake of this task, I should provide a sequence for Alice for the next few turns, and optionally for Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nSo I can plan for Alice only, or for both.\n\nBut to maximize reward, I need both to coordinate.\n\nPerhaps in this state, the best is to have Alice grab an onion and both move towards the pots, and I'll provide actions for a few turns.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, and we need to deliver, let's plan to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nAt turn 9, Alice: I (grab onion)\n\nBob: R (move right to (5,3))\n\nThen turn 10: Alice: L (move left to (2,3))\n\nBob: R (move to (6,3))\n\nTurn 11: Alice: D (move down to (2,2) but (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she can't.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can move left to (1,3): L\n\nBob: D (move down to (6,2))\n\nTurn 12: Alice: D (move down to (1,2))\n\nBob: D (move down to (6,1))\n\nTurn 13: Alice: D (move down to (1,1))\n\nBob: L (move left to (5,1))\n\nTurn 14: Alice: R (move right to (2,1))\n\nBob: L (move left to (4,1))\n\nTurn 15: Alice: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nBob: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 16: Alice: D (change orientation down)\n\nBob: I (interact with (4,0) to add onion)\n\nTurn 17: Alice: I (interact with (3,0) to add onion)\n\nThen at turn 17, both pots have one onion each.\n\nFor the next turns, Alice can go to grab another onion for one pot.\n\nBut I need to provide a sequence for Alice for H turns, say H=5 or 10.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify H, so I can choose H=5 for the plan.\n\nBut with H=5, at turn 9 to 13, Alice might not have added the onion yet.\n\nIn the above, at turn 13, Alice is at (1,1), not at pot.\n\nLet's list Alice actions only for now.\n\nFrom turn 9:\n\nTurn 9: Alice I (grab onion at (3,4))\n\nTurn 10: Alice L (move left to (2,3))\n\nTurn 11: Alice L (move left to (1,3))\n\nTurn 12: Alice D (move down to (1,2))\n\nTurn 13: Alice D (move down to (1,1))\n\nThen at turn 13, she is at (1,1), holding onion.\n\nThen she can move to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut for H=5, actions from turn 9 to 13: I, L, L, D, D\n\nBut she still has the onion, not added.\n\nFor Bob, similarly.\n\nTo deliver soup, we need the plate as well.\n\nPerhaps Alice can go for the plate after adding onion.\n\nBut let's include Bob in the plan for better coordination.\n\nAt turn 9:\nAlice: I\nBob: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 10:\nAlice: L ( to (2,3) )\nBob: I (interact with (4,2) to place onion on counter)\n\nTurn 11:\nAlice: L ( to (1,3) )\nBob: U (change orientation to up)\n\nTurn 12:\nAlice: D ( to (1,2) )\nBob: I (grab onion from (4,4))\n\nTurn 13:\nAlice: D ( to (1,1) )\nBob: D (change orientation to down)  // to face the counter\n\nTurn 14:\nAlice: R ( to (2,1) )\nBob: I (interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion he placed, but he is holding an onion, so he can't pick up; he needs to be empty-handed.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt turn 12, Bob grabs onion, so he is holding onion.\n\nAt turn 13, he changes to down.\n\nAt turn 14, he can't interact to pick up because he has item.\n\nHe can place his current onion on another counter or something.\n\nNot good.\n\nI think I should provide the initial sequence and assume they add the onions later.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide a sequence for Alice for 5 turns.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 9: I  (grab onion)\n\nTurn 10: L  (move left to (2,3))\n\nTurn 11: L  (move left to (1,3))\n\nTurn 12: D  (move down to (1,2))\n\nTurn 13: D  (move down to (1,1))\n\nThen she can go to (2,1), etc.\n\nFor the box, I need to output the actions.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and with the constraints, it might be slow, but I'll do my best.\n\nPerhaps they can use the left path for Alice to add to (3,0), and Bob to add to (4,0), then Alice can go for plates while Bob gets the third onion.\n\nBut let's stop and provide the sequence.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 9:\n\nTurn 9: I\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: L\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nAnd for Bob, optionally, but I can include.\n\nBut the answer format is for Alice only, I think.\n\nThe answer format shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" for Alice, I believe.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\"\n\nAnd the format has \"a_{t_1}\" which is for Alice.\n\nSo I'll provide for Alice.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: I\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: L\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nAt turn 13, she is at (1,1), holding onion, and can then move to (2,1), etc to add to pot.\n\nBut for H=5, this is it.\n\nH is not specified, so I can choose H=5.\n\nOr H=10.\n\nBut let's say for 5 turns.\n\nTo make it better, at turn 9, Alice I.\n\nThen she can move down, but can't, so move left.\n\nPerhaps after grabbing, she can change orientation to down to interact with (3,2), but (3,2) is kitchen counter, so she can place the onion on it if she wants.\n\nAt turn 9: Alice I, grab onion.\n\nThen at turn 10, she can D to change orientation down, then at turn 11, I to place onion on (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nThen she is empty-handed, and can go to grab plate or something.\n\nBut then the onion is on counter, and someone needs to pick it up to add to pot.\n\nSimilarly, it might not be efficient.\n\nI think for now, I'll go with the initial plan.\n\nSo Alice actions for turns 9 to 13: I, L, L, D, D\n\nSo in the box:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: I\nTurn 10: L\nTurn 11: L\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: D\n}\n\nBut Turn 9 is t_1, so a_{9} to a_{13} for t=0 to 4, but the sequence is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo for H=5, turns 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nActions: I, L, L, D, D\n\nYes.\n\nTo include more context, but I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob must coordinate to collect onions, fill a pot, cook the soup, and deliver it using a plate. Given the current state at turn 9:\n- Alice is at (3,3), facing up, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (4,3), facing up, holding one onion.\n- All kitchen counters are empty, and both pots are empty.\n- The only recipe is onion soup (3 onions), with a reward of 20 and a cooking time of 5 turns.\n- Onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), and the plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nThe optimal plan focuses on:\n1. **Immediate onion collection**: Alice grabs an onion from the dispenser at (3,4) since she is adjacent and facing it.\n2. **Efficient movement to pots**: Due to kitchen counters blocking direct vertical paths (e.g., (3,2) and (4,2) are non-walkable), Alice and Bob must move horizontally to columns with empty tiles at y=2 (e.g., (1,2) or (6,2)) before descending to the pot area.\n3. **Pot selection**: Both players target pot (4,0) for efficiency, as Bob is closer to it after initial moves. Alice will add her onion first, then Bob adds his, and a third onion is needed.\n4. **Cooking and delivery**: Once the pot has 3 onions, it cooks automatically in 5 turns. During cooking, one player retrieves a plate from (0,2) for serving at (7,2).\n\n### Coordinated Plan for Turns 9-18 (H=10 turns)\n- **Turns 9-13**: Alice and Bob move to add their onions to pot (4,0). Alice grabs an onion first, then both navigate around obstacles to reach (4,1) and (3,1).\n- **Turns 14-18**: Alice adds her onion to pot (4,0), Bob adds his, and Alice moves to collect a third onion while Bob retrieves a plate. Soup cooking starts at turn 18.\n\n#### Alice's Actions (turns 9-18):\n- **Turn 9 (t₁)**: `I` - Alice interacts with the onion dispenser at (3,4) to grab an onion (she is adjacent, facing up, and empty-handed).\n- **Turn 10**: `L` - Alice moves left to (2,3) to avoid Bob and start pathing toward the left exit column.\n- **Turn 11**: `L` - Alice moves left to (1,3) to reach a column with an empty tile at y=2.\n- **Turn 12**: `D` - Alice moves down to (1,2) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 13**: `D` - Alice moves down to (1,1) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 14**: `R` - Alice moves right to (2,1) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 15**: `R` - Alice moves right to (3,1) (empty tile; adjacent to pot (3,0) but targets (4,0)).\n- **Turn 16**: `R` - Alice moves right to (4,1) (empty tile; now adjacent to pot (4,0)).\n- **Turn 17**: `D` - Alice changes orientation to down to face pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 18**: `I` - Alice interacts to add her onion to pot (4,0). Pot now has 1 onion (Bob's onion is added separately).\n\n#### Bob's Actions (optional, for coordination):\n- **Turn 9**: `R` - Bob moves right to (5,3) to avoid Alice and start pathing toward the right exit column.\n- **Turn 10**: `R` - Bob moves right to (6,3) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 11**: `D` - Bob moves down to (6,2) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 12**: `D` - Bob moves down to (6,1) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 13**: `L` - Bob moves left to (5,1) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 14**: `L` - Bob moves left to (4,1) (empty tile; adjacent to pot (4,0)).\n- **Turn 15**: `D` - Bob changes orientation to down to face pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 16**: `I` - Bob interacts to add his onion to pot (4,0). Pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 17**: `U` - Bob changes orientation to up to prepare for movement.\n- **Turn 18**: `U` - Bob moves up to (4,2), but (4,2) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable), so he must stay or adjust; better to `S` (stay) and replan next turn.\n\n### Why This Plan Maximizes Reward\n- **Efficiency**: By turn 18, pot (4,0) has 2 onions (from Alice and Bob). Alice can grab a third onion from (3,4) by turn 19-20, and add it by turn 21, starting cooking. Cooking finishes at turn 26.\n- **Plate retrieval**: Bob can fetch a plate from (0,2) during cooking (turns 19-23), then deliver the soup at turn 27 for 20 reward.\n- **Coordination**: Alice handles onion collection and initial pot addition, Bob adds his onion early and handles plates, minimizing idle time.\n- **Total turns**: Soup delivery by turn 27 is achievable, with potential for a second soup if time permits.\n\n### Output for Alice (H=10 turns)\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: I\nTurn 10: L\nTurn 11: L\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: D\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: R\nTurn 16: R\nTurn 17: D\nTurn 18: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current game state. It's turn 13, and I'm Alice. I'm at position (3,3), facing down, and holding one onion. Bob is at (6,1), facing down, holding one onion. There are no items on any kitchen counters, and both pots are empty.\n\nThe recipe we have is for onion soup: 3 onions, cooking time 5 turns, reward 20. There are no tomato dispensers, only onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), and a plate dispenser at (0,2). Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), and the serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nSince both Alice and Bob are holding onions, and the pots are empty, we need to get these onions into a pot to start cooking. But a pot requires 3 onions to start cooking automatically. Currently, we have two onions (one with Alice, one with Bob), so we need one more onion.\n\nThe onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). Alice is at (3,3), which is directly below (3,4). Since she's facing down, she might not be facing the dispenser. Position (3,3) is adjacent to (3,4) to the north? Let me check the coordinates.\n\nThe grid: y increases going up, I assume, since U is y+1. So (3,3) to (3,4) is north, which is up. Alice is at (3,3) facing down (south). So she's facing away from the dispenser at (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (6,1) facing down, holding an onion. But he needs to go to a pot or something.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are at the bottom row, y=0.\n\nServing counter is at (7,2).\n\nKitchen counters are at various positions, but all empty.\n\nTo make soup, we need to put three onions into a pot. Then it cooks for 5 turns, after which we can serve it with a plate.\n\nCurrently, we have two onions, so we need one more. Alice can interact with the onion dispenser to get another onion, but she's already holding one. Players can only carry one item at a time, so if she's holding an onion, she can't grab another one. She needs to place her onion somewhere or put it in a pot.\n\nBut pots are empty, and they need three ingredients. If she puts one onion in, it won't cook yet.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nWe have two options: either one of us puts our onion into a pot, and then someone else gets another onion to add, or we both go to pots and add them, but since pots need three, adding one or two doesn't start cooking.\n\nBut we need to start cooking as soon as possible because it takes 5 turns to cook.\n\nSince both pots are empty, we can choose one pot to use.\n\nLet me think about positions.\n\nAlice is at (3,3). Below her at (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Let's see what tiles are there.\n\nTile types: kitchen counters include (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. (3,2) is a kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly, (3,0) is a pot.\n\nAlice is at (3,3), facing down. So if she moves down to (3,2), she would be on a kitchen counter tile? But players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles, but kitchen counter is a tile that can have items, but the tile itself is walkable, I think.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" It doesn't say kitchen counter is not walkable. Let me check.\n\nIn the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But \"non-empty\" might refer to tiles with items, not the tile type itself.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty tiles\" probably means tiles that have items on them, like if a kitchen counter has an item, it's non-empty and not walkable. But if it's empty, it should be walkable.\n\nSimilarly for other tiles.\n\nIn the tile types, it lists positions for each type, but it doesn't say which are walkable except for empty tiles.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n\n- Dispensers, Pots, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: these are specific tile types.\n\nFor movement: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles are those with items, I believe.\n\nAlso, for interaction, players must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it.\n\nSo, tiles like dispensers, pots, etc., are not walkable if they have items? But dispensers don't have items on them; you interact to grab from dispenser.\n\nI think all tiles except empty tiles are not walkable; you can only be on empty tiles.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nIn the player actions: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nAnd \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nBut \"non-empty tiles\" likely means tiles that have items on them, not the tile types like dispenser or pot.\n\nFor example, a pot tile might be empty or have ingredients cooking, but you can't walk on it; you can only interact from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly for kitchen counter, if it has an item, it's non-empty and not walkable; if empty, it might be walkable? But the rule says \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and for interaction, you can pick up or place items when adjacent.\n\nBut for movement, I think only empty tiles are walkable. The rules say \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" implying that other tiles are not inherently walkable.\n\nLet me look back.\n\n\"1. Game Grid (2D Tile Types)\" lists:\n\n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n\n- Dispensers: Sources for items...\n\n- Pot: Cooks soup...\n\n- Serving Counter: Deliver cooked soup...\n\n- Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say which are walkable, but from \"Empty Tile: Walkable space,\" it suggests that only empty tiles are walkable, and others are not.\n\nAlso, in interaction: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo, the player must be on an empty tile, and the target tile is non-empty, meaning it has something to interact with, like a dispenser or pot with items.\n\nBut dispensers are always interactable, I think, even if no one is using them; they are sources.\n\nThe key point is that for interaction, the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target tile.\n\nAnd for movement, players can only move to empty tiles, I believe, since non-empty tiles cannot be walked onto.\n\n\"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those with items, but tile types like dispenser are not \"empty\" in the sense of being walkable; they are obstacles.\n\nI think it's standard in Overcooked that only floor tiles are walkable, and objects like counters, dispensers, pots are on tiles that are not walkable; you move around them on empty tiles.\n\nFor example, in the grid, there are empty tiles where players can stand, and object tiles where players cannot stand, but can interact from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nLet me see the positions given.\n\nKitchen Counter positions are listed, so those tiles are kitchen counter tiles, not empty, so not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, dispensers, pots, serving counter are not walkable.\n\nOnly positions not listed as those types are empty tiles, I assume.\n\nIn this case, the grid isn't fully described, but we have the positions of all non-empty tiles.\n\nThe tile types are given, so for example, (3,4) is an onion dispenser, so not walkable. (3,3) is not listed in any non-empty tile, so it must be an empty tile, since Alice is there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) Bob is there, not listed, so empty tile.\n\n(3,2) is listed as kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\n(3,0) is pot, not walkable.\n\nSo, players can only be on empty tiles, and interact with object tiles from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nAlice at (3,3): let's see adjacent tiles.\n\nNorth: (3,4) - onion dispenser\n\nSouth: (3,2) - kitchen counter (not walkable)\n\nEast: (4,3) - not listed, so empty tile? Let's check all non-empty tiles.\n\nNon-empty tiles: kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, serving counter.\n\nKitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)]\n\nTomato Dispenser: none\n\nOnion Dispenser: [(3,4), (4,4)]\n\nPlate Dispenser: [(0,2)]\n\nPot: [(3,0), (4,0)]\n\nServing Counter: [(7,2)]\n\nSo, for Alice at (3,3):\n\n- North: (3,4) - onion dispenser\n\n- South: (3,2) - kitchen counter\n\n- East: (4,3) - not listed, so empty tile\n\n- West: (2,3) - not listed, so empty tile\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (6,1):\n\n- North: (6,2) - not listed? Kitchen counters include (5,2), (6,2) not listed, (6,2) is not in kitchen counter list, not in any, so empty? Kitchen counters are at (2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2), so (6,2) is not listed, so empty tile.\n\n- South: (6,0) - kitchen counter (since (6,0) in list)\n\n- East: (7,1) - kitchen counter\n\n- West: (5,1) - not listed, empty? (5,1) not in any list, so empty.\n\nNow, Alice is facing down (south), towards (3,2), which is a kitchen counter. But she can only interact if she is adjacent and facing, but (3,2) is adjacent south, and she is facing it, so she could interact with it.\n\nBut she is holding an onion, and the kitchen counter is empty, so she could place the onion on the kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly, she could move east or west.\n\nBob is at (6,1) facing down, south to (6,0) kitchen counter, so he could interact to place his onion there.\n\nBut we need to make soup, so placing onions on counters might not be efficient; better to put them in pots.\n\nBut pots need three onions to cook.\n\nSince we have two onions, we need one more.\n\nAlice is near an onion dispenser; she is at (3,3), onion dispenser at (3,4) north. She is facing south, so not facing it.\n\nTo interact with the dispenser, she needs to be facing it, but she is holding an onion, so she can't grab another; she needs to be empty-handed.\n\nFirst, she needs to do something with her onion.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Place onion on adjacent kitchen counter at (3,2). But (3,2) is south, she is facing it, so she can interact to place it.\n\nThen she would be empty-handed, then she can turn north to face the dispenser and interact to grab another onion.\n\nBut placing on counter might not be necessary if she can go directly to a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nFrom (3,3), to reach (3,0), she needs to go down, but (3,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable, so she can't go south directly.\n\nShe can go east to (4,3), then south to (4,2), but (4,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nLet's find a path to the pots.\n\nAlice at (3,3). Empty tiles around: east (4,3) and west (2,3).\n\n(2,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) empty.\n\nThen from (4,3), south is (4,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nWest from (3,3) to (2,3), then south to (2,2)? (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo no direct south path from y=3 to y=0 at x=3 or 4 because of kitchen counters at y=2.\n\nKitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), so at y=2, x from 2 to 5 are counters, blocking the way.\n\nBut there must be a way to reach the pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are on the bottom row.\n\nBelow y=2, at y=1, there are kitchen counters at (0,1), (7,1), and (7,3) etc., but at (3,1) and (4,1)? Not listed, so probably empty.\n\nList: kitchen counters at (0,1), (7,1), and (7,3), (0,3), etc.\n\nFor y=1: (0,1) and (7,1) are kitchen counters, so (1,1) to (6,1) might be empty except Bob is at (6,1), so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) should be empty if not listed.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), and pots at (3,0), (4,0). Pots are separate tiles.\n\n(3,0) is a pot tile, not kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly, (4,0) pot.\n\nTo reach pot at (3,0), player needs to be adjacent, e.g., at (3,1) or (2,0) or (4,0), but (4,0) is pot, not walkable, (2,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so only possible from (3,1) or (4,1) for (4,0), etc.\n\n(3,1) is not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) empty.\n\nFrom Alice at (3,3), she can go east to (4,3), then south to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she can't go south from (4,3).\n\nShe can go west to (2,3), then south to (2,2)? (2,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo how to get down? She needs to go to a row where y=2 is not blocked, but at x=3 and 4, y=2 is blocked.\n\nPerhaps go to x=1 or x=6, but let's see.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), she can go east to (4,3), then east to (5,3)? (5,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (5,3), south to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nWest from (3,3) to (2,3), then west to (1,3)? (1,3) not listed, but kitchen counters include (0,3) and (7,3), so (1,3) and (2,3) are empty, (3,3) empty, etc.\n\n(1,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen south from (1,3) to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), etc., not (1,2), so (1,2) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1), (1,0) is kitchen counter, so (1,2) empty.\n\nThen from (1,2), she can go south to (1,1), empty, then to (1,0) kitchen counter, not walkable, but to reach a pot, she needs to go to (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nFrom (1,1), she can go east to (2,1), then to (3,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is empty, adjacent to pot at (3,0).\n\nSo Alice can go west to (2,3), then west to (1,3), then south to (1,2), then south to (1,1), then east to (2,1), then east to (3,1). From (3,1), she can interact with pot at (3,0) south, but she needs to face south.\n\nBut that's a long path.\n\nFrom (3,3), she can go east to (4,3), then east to (5,3), then south to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(5,2) is listed as kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\nThen to (6,3)? (6,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen south to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, kitchen counters at (5,2), but not (6,2), so (6,2) empty.\n\nThen south to (6,1)? (6,1) is where Bob is, but Bob is there, so she can't move to (6,1) if occupied.\n\nPlayers cannot walk through each other.\n\nBob is at (6,1), so (6,1) is occupied.\n\nFrom (6,2), she can go south to (6,1), but Bob is there, so not possible.\n\nShe can go to (7,2), but (7,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\nSo the only way down is via the sides, like x=1 or x=6, but at x=6, Bob is at (6,1), so it might be blocked.\n\nLet's list all empty tiles or possible paths.\n\nPerhaps from (3,3), she can go north to the dispenser, but (3,4) is dispenser, not walkable, so she can only interact from (3,3) if facing north.\n\nBut she is facing south.\n\nFirst, for Alice to reach a pot, it will take multiple turns.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBob is at (6,1), holding an onion.\n\nAdjacent: north (6,2) empty? (6,2) not listed, so empty.\n\nSouth (6,0) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nEast (7,1) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nWest (5,1) empty, since not listed.\n\nFrom (6,1), he can go west to (5,1), then south to (5,0)? (5,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nNorth to (6,2), then west to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nEast from (6,2) to (7,2) serving counter, not walkable.\n\nSo to reach a pot, for example, pot at (4,0), he needs to be at (4,1) or (3,0) or (5,0), but (3,0) pot, not walkable, (5,0) kitchen counter, not walkable, so only (4,1) or (3,1) for (3,0).\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nFrom (6,1), go west to (5,1), then west to (4,1)? (4,1) empty.\n\nThen from (4,1), he can interact with pot at (4,0) south.\n\nSimilarly for (3,0) from (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is empty.\n\nSo Bob can go west to (5,1), then west to (4,1), then interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) is one move west, then to (4,1) another move west, then at (4,1) facing south to interact with (4,0).\n\nSo 2 moves to reach position, then interact.\n\nSimilarly for Alice to reach a pot.\n\nAlice at (3,3), to reach (3,1) for pot at (3,0).\n\nFrom (3,3), she can go west to (2,3), then south to (2,2)? (2,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nGo east to (4,3), then south to (4,2)? not walkable.\n\nGo west to (2,3), then west to (1,3), then south to (1,2), then south to (1,1), then east to (2,1), then east to (3,1).\n\nThat's many moves: from (3,3) to (2,3) W, to (1,3) W, to (1,2) S, to (1,1) S, to (2,1) E, to (3,1) E. 5 moves to reach (3,1), then interact.\n\nThat's too long.\n\nFrom (3,3) east to (4,3), east to (5,3), then south to (5,2)? not walkable, so to (6,3), but (6,3) not listed, empty, then south to (6,2), but Bob is at (6,1), and (6,2) to (6,1) south, but (6,1) occupied, so she can't go to (6,2) if she wants to go down, but (6,2) is empty, she can go to (6,2), then from there, she can go west to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable, or east to (7,2) serving counter, not walkable, or south to (6,1) but occupied.\n\nSo from (6,2), she can go west to (5,2) not possible, or she can go north to (6,3), but not down.\n\nSo the only way is via the left side, to (1,1) etc.\n\nBut that's inefficient.\n\nPerhaps she can place the onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2) first, since she is adjacent and facing it.\n\nAt (3,3), facing south to (3,2) kitchen counter, which is adjacent, and she is facing it, so she can interact to place her onion on it.\n\nThen the kitchen counter at (3,2) now has an onion.\n\nThen she is empty-handed.\n\nThen she can turn north to face the onion dispenser at (3,4), which is adjacent north, and interact to grab an onion.\n\nSo in two turns: interact to place, then change orientation to north and interact to grab.\n\nBut changing orientation: the action \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nChange orientation action changes orientation without moving, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty or something? Let's read.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThe phrasing is a bit ambiguous.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means that when you use Change Orientation, it doesn't move you, but it might not be possible if the adjacent tile is not empty, but that doesn't make sense for orientation change.\n\nPerhaps it's: when you change orientation, if you try to move in that direction but the tile is not empty, you don't move, but for orientation change alone, it should just change facing.\n\nI think there's a mistake in interpretation.\n\nLet's read carefully from the rules:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps \"Change Orientation\" action is used to face a direction, and it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" but that doesn't relate.\n\nI think it might be a typo or misphrasing.\n\nIn many implementations, Change Orientation is a separate action that only changes facing, no move, and it doesn't depend on adjacent tiles.\n\nBut here it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which suggests that it might not be possible to change orientation if the adjacent tile is not empty, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps it's for the move action: when you move, you change position and orientation, but if the adjacent tile is not empty, you don't move.\n\nFor Change Orientation action, it should just change facing.\n\nLet's read the full text:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n- Interact (I): ... \n- Stay (S): Do nothing.\"\n\nThe \"Change Orientation\" action has \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which is odd.\n\nPerhaps it means that when you use Change Orientation, it doesn't move you, and the condition is separate, but it's poorly worded.\n\nI think it might be that for Change Orientation, it always changes orientation, and the \"no move\" part is redundant or misstated.\n\nIn context, \"No move\" probably means that it doesn't involve movement, unlike the Move action.\n\nBut the phrase \"if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps it's for the case when you press a direction, it could be move or change orientation, but here they are separate actions.\n\nTo simplify, I think for planning, we can assume that Change Orientation action just changes the facing to that direction, without moving, and it's always possible, as long as you are on a tile.\n\nThen, for Interact, you need to be adjacent and facing.\n\nFor Alice at (3,3), she can:\n\n- Interact (I) to place the onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2) south, since she is facing it and adjacent.\n\nThen she is empty-handed.\n\nThen she can Change Orientation to U to face north.\n\nThen Interact with the onion dispenser at (3,4) to grab an onion.\n\nSo in three actions: I (place onion on counter), U (face up), I (grab onion).\n\nBut Change Orientation U means face up.\n\nThen she has an onion again.\n\nBut the onion on the counter can be used later.\n\nSimilarly, she could go to a pot, but it's far.\n\nBob is at (6,1), facing down, south to (6,0) kitchen counter.\n\nHe can interact to place his onion on (6,0) if it's empty.\n\n(6,0) is a kitchen counter, and it's empty, so he can place it there.\n\nThen he is empty-handed.\n\nBut he is far from pots or dispensers.\n\nFrom (6,1), he can go west to (5,1), then to (4,1) as before.\n\nBut let's think about the soup making.\n\nSince both players have onions, and pots are empty, we need to add three onions to a pot.\n\nAlice can place her onion on the counter at (3,2), then grab another onion from dispenser.\n\nThen she has an onion, and there is an onion on the counter.\n\nBob can go to a pot and add his onion, but one onion in pot doesn't start cooking.\n\nBetter to have one player add their onion to a pot, then another player add another, etc.\n\nBut with two players, we can coordinate.\n\nSince Alice is near the onion dispenser, she can be the one to gather onions.\n\nBob is closer to the pots.\n\nBob at (6,1), to reach (4,1) for pot at (4,0): he can go west to (5,1), then west to (4,1), then face south to interact with pot.\n\nAt (4,1), he can add his onion to the pot at (4,0).\n\nThen the pot has one onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can go to the same pot or another.\n\nPot at (4,0) has one onion, needs two more.\n\nAlice has an onion, but she is at (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1) is not direct.\n\nShe can go to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2), but (6,2) is empty, then to (6,1) but occupied, so she can go to (6,2), then west to (5,2)? not walkable, or south to (6,1) not possible.\n\nFrom (6,2), she can go west, but (5,2) not walkable, so she is stuck.\n\nThe only way is via (1,1) as before.\n\nBut that's too slow.\n\nAlice can place her onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2) first.\n\nAt turn 13, Alice is at (3,3), facing D (south), so she can Interact to place the onion on (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nThen she is empty-handed.\n\nThen she can Change Orientation to U to face north.\n\nThen Interact with onion dispenser at (3,4) to grab an onion.\n\nSo after three actions, she has an onion, and there is an onion on (3,2).\n\nBob is at (6,1), facing down. He can Interact to place his onion on (6,0) kitchen counter, since he is facing it and adjacent south.\n\nThen he is empty-handed.\n\nThen he can move to a pot.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), go west to (5,1), then west to (4,1).\n\nAt (4,1), he can face south and interact with pot at (4,0) to add an ingredient, but the pot is empty, so adding an onion.\n\nBut he is empty-handed now, so he can't add anything.\n\nHe placed his onion on the counter.\n\nSo he needs to pick up an onion or something.\n\nLet's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn 13, Alice can do I to place onion on (3,2).\n\nThen at turn 14, Alice do U to face north.\n\nTurn 15, Alice do I to grab onion from dispenser.\n\nNow Alice has an onion, and (3,2) has an onion.\n\nBob at turn 13: he can do I to place onion on (6,0).\n\nThen he is empty.\n\nThen he can move to a dispenser or to the counter where there is an onion.\n\nBut dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), far from him.\n\nOr he can go to (3,2) to pick up the onion, but (3,2) is at (3,2), Alice is near.\n\nBob at (6,1), after placing onion, he can go to (5,1) west, then to (4,1) west, then he is at (4,1), near pot at (4,0).\n\nBut he has no item, so he can't add to pot.\n\nHe needs to get an onion.\n\nThere is an onion at (3,2), but (3,2) is not adjacent to (4,1); (4,1) is at (4,1), (3,2) is at (3,2), not adjacent; adjacent would be (3,1), (4,2), (5,1), etc.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter, but it may have an item or not; currently all counters are empty except we placed on (3,2) and (6,0).\n\n(3,2) has an onion now.\n\nFrom (4,1), Bob can go north to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't go there.\n\nHe can go west to (3,1), which is empty.\n\nFrom (3,1), he can interact with (3,2) north, but (3,2) is kitchen counter, so to interact, he needs to be on adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\n(3,1) is south of (3,2), so if he faces north, he can interact with (3,2) to pick up the onion, since it has an item.\n\nSimilarly, he could interact with pot at (3,0) south.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, Bob needs to reach (3,1) or something.\n\nFrom Bob's position at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: Bob can do something else.\n\nSince we need to start cooking, and cooking takes 5 turns, we should start as soon as possible.\n\nThe fastest way is for one player to add their onion to a pot, then another adds, but we have only two onions now.\n\nAlice can go to the pot with her onion, but it's far.\n\nLet's calculate the shortest path for Alice to reach a pot position.\n\nAlice at (3,3) to (3,1) for pot at (3,0).\n\nPath: west to (2,3), then south to (2,2)? not walkable, so must go via (1,3): (3,3) W to (2,3), W to (1,3), S to (1,2), S to (1,1), E to (2,1), E to (3,1). 5 moves.\n\nAt (3,1), she can face south and interact with pot at (3,0) to add onion.\n\nSimilarly for Bob to (4,1): from (6,1) W to (5,1), W to (4,1), 2 moves, then interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nBut at (4,0), pot is empty, so adding one onion.\n\nThen we have one onion in each pot, not cooking.\n\nThen we need to add more.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1) after adding, empty-handed, then she can go to a dispenser.\n\nBut dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), far.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can go north to (3,2)? not walkable, so east to (4,1), then north to (4,2)? not walkable, so must go to (4,1), then east to (5,1), etc., to go up.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps use one pot for soup.\n\nLet's choose one pot, say (4,0).\n\nBob is closer; he can go to (4,1) in two moves and add his onion.\n\nThen Alice can go to (4,1) to add her onion, but she is at (3,3), far.\n\nAfter Bob adds, the pot has one onion, needs two more.\n\nAlice can go to the onion dispenser to get another onion, but she has one already.\n\nAlice has an onion, so she can go directly to (4,1) to add it.\n\nBut path from (3,3) to (4,1).\n\n(3,3) to (4,3) E, then to (5,3) E, then to (6,3) E, then to (6,2) S, but (6,2) to (6,1) S occupied, so she can go to (6,2), then from (6,2) she can go west, but (5,2) not walkable, so she is stuck at (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,3) she can go south to (6,2), then since (6,1) occupied, she can only go back north or east.\n\nNo way to (4,1) directly.\n\nVia (1,1): from (3,3) W to (2,3), W to (1,3), S to (1,2), S to (1,1), then E to (2,1), E to (3,1), then E to (4,1). From (3,1) to (4,1) is east.\n\nSo positions: (3,3) -> (2,3) W, -> (1,3) W, -> (1,2) S, -> (1,1) S, -> (2,1) E, -> (3,1) E, -> (4,1) E. 7 moves to reach (4,1).\n\nThen at (4,1), she can add her onion to pot at (4,0).\n\nBut Bob is at (4,1) or something, but let's see.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nAlice can place her onion on (3,2) as before, then grab another, so we have two onions on counters or with players.\n\nBut we need to get three in a pot.\n\nPerhaps Bob can add his onion to a pot, then Alice adds hers, then someone gets the third onion.\n\nBut Alice can be the one to get the third onion.\n\nLet's coordinate.\n\nAt turn 13:\n\nAlice is at (3,3), facing D, holding onion.\n\nShe can I to place onion on (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nBob is at (6,1), facing D, holding onion.\n\nHe can I to place onion on (6,0) kitchen counter.\n\nThen both empty.\n\nTurn 14:\n\nAlice can U to face north.\n\nBob can move towards a pot or something.\n\nAlice at turn 14: U to face north.\n\nThen turn 15: Alice I to grab onion from (3,4) dispenser, now holding onion.\n\nBob at turn 14: since he is at (6,1), empty, he can go to the onion on (3,2) but it's far, or to a dispenser.\n\nDispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), both near Alice.\n\nBob can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate, but we need onions first.\n\nOr he can go to (3,2) to pick up the onion there.\n\n(3,2) has an onion from Alice's placement.\n\nBob at (6,1), to reach (3,2).\n\nPath: from (6,1) W to (5,1), then W to (4,1), then he is at (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), he can interact with (3,2)? (3,2) is at (3,2), (4,1) is at (4,1), not adjacent; adjacent to (3,2) are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, (2,2) kitchen counter, (3,1) and (3,3) empty.\n\nSo to interact with (3,2) from south at (3,1), he needs to be at (3,1) facing north.\n\nSimilarly from north at (3,3) facing south.\n\nSo Bob can go from (4,1) to (3,1) W, then at (3,1) face north to interact with (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) has an onion, so he can pick it up.\n\nThen he has an onion.\n\nSimilarly, he can then go to a pot to add it.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nTurn 13:\nAlice: I (place onion on (3,2))\nBob: I (place onion on (6,0))\n\nTurn 14:\nAlice: U (face north)\nBob: W (move west to (5,1))\n\nTurn 15:\nAlice: I (grab onion from (3,4))\nBob: W (move west to (4,1))  // from (5,1) to (4,1)\n\nAt turn 15, Bob is at (4,1).\n\nTurn 16:\nAlice: now at (3,3) holding onion, she can go to a pot or something.\nBut she is near dispenser, she could grab another onion, but she has one, so she can't.\n\nShe can go to (3,2) to interact, but (3,2) has no item now? At turn 13 she placed onion on (3,2), but at turn 16, it might be picked up.\n\nBob is at (4,1) at turn 15.\n\nTurn 16:\nAlice: she can move towards a pot. For example, she can go south but not possible, so W to (2,3) or E to (4,3).\n\nSay she goes W to (2,3).\n\nBob at turn 16: from (4,1), he can W to (3,1) to go towards the onion at (3,2).\n\nBut at (3,2), there is an onion, but to pick it up, he needs to be at (3,1) or (3,3) and facing.\n\nAt turn 16 Bob: W to (3,1)\n\nThen at (3,1), he can face north and interact to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nBut Alice is at (2,3) or something.\n\nThis is getting messy, and we are using many turns.\n\nAnother idea: since both players have onions, and Alice is near a pot? No.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), Alice is at (3,3), not adjacent.\n\nBut she can go to (3,1) via a long path.\n\nPerhaps Bob can add his onion to a pot directly.\n\nBob at (6,1), to (4,1): W to (5,1) on turn 14, then W to (4,1) on turn 15.\n\nAt (4,1), he can D to face south, then I to add onion to pot at (4,0).\n\nSo in three turns: turn 13 Bob I to place? No, he is holding onion.\n\nAt turn 13, Bob can move instead of placing.\n\nTurn 13 Bob: W to (5,1)  // move west\n\nTurn 14 Bob: W to (4,1)  // move west\n\nTurn 15 Bob: D to face south (since he needs to face the pot to interact)\n\nThen turn 16 Bob: I to add onion to pot at (4,0)\n\nSimilarly, Alice can do the same for another pot or the same.\n\nBut for the same pot, Alice needs to go to (4,1) to add.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1) is not direct, as before.\n\nAlice at (3,3), she can go E to (4,3), then S but not possible, so E to (5,3), then S to (5,2)? not walkable, so to (6,3), then S to (6,2), then at (6,2), she can W to (5,2)? not possible, or S to (6,1) but occupied by Bob at some point.\n\nAssume Bob is moving to (4,1).\n\nAt turn 13, Bob is at (6,1), so (6,1) occupied.\n\nAlice at turn 13: instead of placing, she can move towards a pot.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nThe fastest way to start cooking is to have one player add their onion to a pot, then the other add theirs, but we need a third onion.\n\nSo Alice, being near the dispenser, can provide the third onion.\n\nSo at turn 13:\n\nAlice: I to place onion on (3,2)  // so the onion is stored\n\nThen Alice: U to face north on turn 14\n\nAlice: I to grab new onion on turn 15  // now she has an onion\n\nBob at turn 13: instead of placing, he moves towards the pot at (4,0)\n\nBob: W to (5,1)  // move west\n\nTurn 14 Bob: W to (4,1)  // move west\n\nTurn 15 Bob: D to face south  // prepare to interact\n\nTurn 16 Bob: I to add his onion to pot at (4,0)  // now pot has one onion\n\nAlice at turn 15 has an onion, and there is an onion on (3,2)\n\nAlice can go to the pot to add her onion.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1): as before, it's hard.\n\nShe can go to (3,1) first.\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 16: she can W to (2,3)  // move west\n\nTurn 17: W to (1,3)  // move west\n\nTurn 18: S to (1,2)  // move south\n\nTurn 19: S to (1,1)  // move south\n\nTurn 20: E to (2,1)  // move east\n\nTurn 21: E to (3,1)  // move east\n\nTurn 22: D to face south\n\nTurn 23: I to add onion to pot at (3,0)  // but this is for pot at (3,0), not the same as Bob's.\n\nBob added to (4,0), so different pot.\n\nIf she wants to add to (4,0), from (3,1) she can E to (4,1), then face south and interact.\n\nTurn 24: E to (4,1)\n\nTurn 25: D to face south\n\nTurn 26: I to add to pot at (4,0)\n\nBut at turn 16, pot at (4,0) has one onion from Bob.\n\nThen at turn 26, Alice adds second onion, so pot has two onions.\n\nThen we need a third onion.\n\nBut Alice added her onion, so she is empty.\n\nThen she can go back to get another onion.\n\nBut it's turn 27, many turns.\n\nAfter Bob adds at turn 16, pot has one onion.\n\nThen Alice can add her onion to the same pot, but she needs to reach (4,1).\n\nFrom her position at turn 16, she is at (3,3) holding onion.\n\nInstead of going the long way, she can place the onion on a counter closer to the pot.\n\nFor example, at (3,3), she can place on (3,2) again, but (3,2) may have an onion or not.\n\nAt turn 13, she placed on (3,2), then at turn 15 she grabbed new onion, so (3,2) has the first onion.\n\nThen at turn 16, Alice can go to (4,3) E, then to (5,3) E, etc., but not down.\n\nOr she can go to (4,3), then there is a kitchen counter at (4,2), she can interact if facing south, but she is at (4,3), (4,2) is south, so if she faces south, she can interact to place the onion on (4,2) if empty.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter, and empty, so she can place it there.\n\nThen the onion is at (4,2), which is above (4,1), so Bob at (4,1) can pick it up.\n\nBob at (4,1) after adding his onion at turn 16, he is empty at (4,1).\n\nThen he can face north to interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion from (4,2).\n\nThen he has an onion, and can add to the pot again.\n\nBut the pot has one onion, he adds second.\n\nThen we need third.\n\nAlice after placing at (4,2), she can go to dispenser to get another onion.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 13:\nAlice: I (place onion on (3,2))  // onion on (3,2)\nBob: W (move west to (5,1))  // Bob moving to pot\n\nTurn 14:\nAlice: U (face north)\nBob: W (move west to (4,1))  // Bob at (4,1)\n\nTurn 15:\nAlice: I (grab onion from (3,4))  // Alice holding onion\nBob: D (face south)  // Bob facing pot\n\nTurn 16:\nAlice: E (move east to (4,3))  // Alice at (4,3)\nBob: I (add onion to pot at (4,0))  // pot has one onion, Bob empty\n\nTurn 17:\nAlice: at (4,3), facing? After move E, she is at (4,3), and move action changes orientation to east, I think, since she moved east.\n\nMove action changes position and orientation to the direction moved.\n\nSo after turn 16 Alice move E to (4,3), she is now at (4,3), facing E.\n\nTo interact with (4,2) south, she needs to face south.\n\nSo she can S to face south, but S is move south, which to (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so if she does S, it might not move if not empty, but \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), etc.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" so if she tries to move south to (4,2), it is not empty tile (since kitchen counter is not empty tile), so she cannot move, but does she change orientation?\n\nThe rule: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nAnd \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nSo if the tile is not walkable, she cannot move, and probably orientation doesn't change, or does it?\n\nThe rule doesn't specify what happens if move is impossible.\n\nSimilarly for Change Orientation.\n\nTo be safe, for Interact, she can Change Orientation to face south first.\n\nAt turn 17:\nAlice: S (change orientation to south? But S is move south or change orientation?\n\nActions are separate: Move or Change Orientation.\n\nSo she can do Change Orientation S to face south.\n\nThen she is at (4,3) facing south towards (4,2).\n\nThen she can Interact to place the onion on (4,2).\n\nThen Bob at (4,1), facing south after adding, he can Change Orientation to U to face north, then Interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen he has an onion, and can add to pot again.\n\nBut the pot has one onion, he adds second.\n\nThen Alice can go to dispenser to get third onion.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 17:\nAlice: Change Orientation S to face south (at (4,3))\n\nTurn 18:\nAlice: I to place onion on (4,2)  // now (4,2) has onion, Alice empty\n\nBob: after turn 16 Bob empty at (4,1) facing south.\n\nTurn 17 Bob: Change Orientation U to face north\n\nTurn 18 Bob: I to pick up onion from (4,2)  // Bob now holding onion\n\nTurn 19:\nAlice: U to face north (at (4,3), facing north towards (4,4) onion dispenser? (4,4) is east? (4,3) north is (4,4), which is onion dispenser.\n\n(4,4) is onion dispenser.\n\nAlice at (4,3), facing north, can interact with (4,4) to grab onion.\n\nBut she needs to be empty-handed; at turn 18 she placed, so empty.\n\nTurn 19 Alice: I to grab onion from (4,4) dispenser? But she is at (4,3), (4,4) is north, she is facing north, so yes, interact to grab onion.\n\nNow Alice holding onion.\n\nBob at turn 19: at (4,1) holding onion, he can D to face south, then I to add onion to pot at (4,0).\n\nPot had one onion, now he adds second, so pot has two onions.\n\nTurn 19 Bob: D to face south\n\nTurn 20 Bob: I to add onion to pot  // pot has two onions\n\nAlice has an onion, she can go to (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1): south to (4,2) not walkable, so she needs to go around.\n\nFrom (4,3) W to (3,3), then S to (3,2)? not walkable, so W to (3,3), then W to (2,3), etc., or E to (5,3), then S to (5,2)? not walkable, so to (6,3), etc.\n\nShortest: from (4,3) W to (3,3), then S not possible, so W to (2,3), then S to (2,2)? not walkable, so to (1,3), etc., long way.\n\nFrom (4,3) E to (5,3), then E to (6,3), then S to (6,2), then from (6,2) W to (5,2)? not walkable, or S to (6,1) if empty.\n\nBut at turn 19, Bob is at (4,1), so (6,1) might be empty.\n\nFrom (6,2) S to (6,1), then W to (5,1), W to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) might be occupied by Bob or not.\n\nAt turn 20, Bob is at (4,1) after adding, so (4,1) occupied.\n\nAlice at (4,3) after grabbing onion at turn 19.\n\nTurn 20 Alice: E to (5,3)  // move east, facing east\n\nTurn 21: E to (6,3)  // move east, facing east\n\nTurn 22: S to (6,2)  // move south, facing south\n\nTurn 23: S to (6,1) but (6,1) may be empty, but at turn 23, Bob might be elsewhere.\n\nBob at turn 20 after adding, he is at (4,1) empty, facing south.\n\nHe can move away.\n\nFor Alice to add to pot, she needs to be at (4,1) or (3,1) etc. for (4,0).\n\nFrom (6,2) at turn 22, she can go W to (5,2)? not walkable, so S to (6,1) on turn 23.\n\nThen from (6,1) W to (5,1) turn 24, W to (4,1) turn 25.\n\nAt (4,1), she can D to face south turn 26, I to add onion turn 27.\n\nThen pot has three onions, cooking starts.\n\nBut at turn 20, pot has two onions, at turn 27 added third, so cooking starts at turn 27.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so ready at turn 32.\n\nThen need to serve with plate.\n\nBut we have only 5 turns history, and we need to plan for H turns, say H=10 or something, but the task is to plan a sequence for Alice for several turns to maximize reward.\n\nBut with this, it takes many turns to start cooking.\n\nPerhaps use the other pot or better coordination.\n\nAnother idea: Alice places onion on (3,2), then grabs new onion, then Bob goes to (3,2) to pick up the onion and add to a pot.\n\nBob at (6,1), to (3,2).\n\nPath: from (6,1) W to (5,1), W to (4,1), W to (3,1), then at (3,1) face north to interact with (3,2) to pick up onion.\n\nThen he can go to a pot, e.g. (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nSay to (3,0): from (3,1) face south, interact to add.\n\nBut Alice has the other onion, she can add to the same pot.\n\nBut she is at (3,3), to (3,1) is not direct.\n\nShe can add to (3,0) from (3,1), but (3,1) might be occupied.\n\nLet's not detail too much; we need a better strategy.\n\nNotice that the recipe is only onion soup, 3 onions, reward 20.\n\nCooking time 5 turns.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2), far.\n\nAfter soup is cooked, someone needs to get a plate, pick up the soup, and deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nBut let's first focus on starting the soup.\n\nSince both players have onions, and Alice is at (3,3), she can place onion on (3,2), then grab new onion, so now she has onion, and (3,2) has onion.\n\nBob can come to pick up the onion from (3,2) and add to a pot.\n\nBut Bob is at (6,1), far.\n\nBob can add his onion to a pot directly.\n\nTurn 13 Bob: W to (5,1)\n\nTurn 14 Bob: W to (4,1)\n\nTurn 15 Bob: D to face south\n\nTurn 16 Bob: I to add onion to (4,0)  // pot has one onion\n\nThen Bob empty at (4,1)\n\nThen he can go to (3,2) to pick up the onion there.\n\nFrom (4,1) W to (3,1) turn 17\n\nTurn 18: U to face north\n\nTurn 19: I to pick up onion from (3,2)  // now Bob holding onion\n\nThen he can add to pot at (4,0) from (4,1)\n\nTurn 20: D to face south\n\nTurn 21: I to add to pot  // pot has two onions\n\nAlice has an onion at (3,3), she can go to (4,1) to add.\n\nFrom (3,3) E to (4,3) turn 17 (after her actions)\n\nLet's list all turns.\n\nStart turn 13:\n\nTurn 13:\nAlice: I (place onion on (3,2))  // assume this is possible\nBob: W (move to (5,1))\n\nTurn 14:\nAlice: U (face north)\nBob: W (move to (4,1))\n\nTurn 15:\nAlice: I (grab onion from (3,4))\nBob: D (face south)\n\nTurn 16:\nAlice: at (3,3) holding onion, she can E to (4,3)  // move east to (4,3), facing east\nBob: I (add onion to (4,0))  // pot has one onion, Bob empty at (4,1) facing south\n\nTurn 17:\nAlice: at (4,3) facing east, she can S to face south? Change Orientation S to face south, then she can I to place onion on (4,2) if she wants, but let's see.\nInstead, she can move or something.\nFor now, she can Change Orientation S to face south.\nBob: from (4,1) W to (3,1)  // move west to (3,1), facing west (since move changes orientation)\n\nTurn 18:\nAlice: at (4,3) facing south, she can I to place onion on (4,2)  // place onion on (4,2), Alice empty\nBob: at (3,1) facing west, he can U to face north (Change Orientation U), then he can I to pick up onion from (3,2)  // but (3,2) has onion from turn 13, so he picks it up, now Bob holding onion\n\nTurn 19:\nAlice: U to face north (at (4,3), facing north)\nBob: at (3,1) holding onion, he can E to (4,1)  // move east to (4,1), facing east\n\nTurn 20:\nAlice: I to grab onion from (4,4) dispenser  // Alice holding onion\nBob: at (4,1) facing east, he can S to face south? Change Orientation S to face south, then he can I to add onion to pot at (4,0)  // pot had one, now adds second, so two onions\n\nTurn 21:\nAlice: holding onion, she can move to (4,1) to add, but (4,1) occupied by Bob.\nShe can go S to (4,2)? not walkable, so she needs to go around.\nShe can go W to (3,3) etc.\nBob: after adding, empty at (4,1) facing south.\n\nAlice at (4,3) can W to (3,3) turn 21, then to (2,3) turn 22, etc., long.\n\nFrom (4,3) she can go directly to (4,1) via (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), but many moves.\n\nAt turn 20, pot has two onions, need third.\n\nAlice has onion at (4,3), she can place it on (4,2), but (4,2) may have item or not; at turn 18 she placed on (4,2), but at turn 20, Bob might have picked it up or not.\n\nAt turn 18, Alice placed on (4,2), then at turn 20, (4,2) has onion unless someone took it.\n\nBob was at (3,1) and (4,1), not at (4,2), so (4,2) still has onion.\n\nAlice has onion, she can place on another counter, but (4,2) already has one.\n\nShe can add directly if she can reach (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo at turn 21, Alice can Change Orientation S to face south at (4,3), then I to place onion on (4,2) again, but (4,2) already has an onion, and kitchen counter can hold one item, I assume, so she can't place if occupied.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify, but probably kitchen counter can hold one item, so if it has an item, you can't place another.\n\nSo (4,2) has onion from turn 18, so Alice cannot place again.\n\nShe can go to a different counter.\n\nFor example, at (4,3), she can move to (5,3) and place on (5,2) if she can face south.\n\nBut (5,2) is kitchen counter.\n\nBut it's farther.\n\nBob at (4,1) can pick up the onion from (4,2) to add to pot, but the pot has two onions, adding another would start cooking, but he needs to pick up first.\n\nAt turn 21 Bob: at (4,1) empty, facing south after adding.\n\nHe can Change Orientation U to face north, then I to pick up onion from (4,2).\n\nThen he has onion, then he can I to add to pot, but he is at (4,1), facing north, so to add to pot south, he needs to face south and interact.\n\nTurn 21 Bob: U to face north\n\nTurn 22 Bob: I to pick up onion from (4,2)  // now holding onion\n\nTurn 23 Bob: D to face south\n\nTurn 24 Bob: I to add to pot  // pot has three onions, cooking starts at turn 24\n\nThen Alice is at (4,3) with onion or something, but she can go to get a plate.\n\nBut at turn 24, cooking starts, ready at turn 29.\n\nAlice can be used to get plates.\n\nBut let's stop here for the soup start.\n\nFor the task, we need to plan Alice's actions for the next few turns to maximize reward.\n\nPerhaps for H=10 turns, from turn 13 to turn 22.\n\nBut with the above, at turn 13, Alice places onion on counter, then faces north, then grabs onion.\n\nThen she can move towards the pot area.\n\nSince the goal is to deliver soup, and cooking takes time, we should start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nWith two players, we can have one focus on cooking, one on plates.\n\nBut we need ingredients first.\n\nAnother idea: Alice and Bob both go to the same pot area.\n\nAlice at (3,3), she can place onion on (3,2), then grab new onion, then move towards (4,1).\n\nBut path: from (3,3) to (4,3), then to (5,3), to (6,3), to (6,2), then to (6,1) if empty, then to (5,1), to (4,1).\n\nBut at turn 13, Bob is at (6,1), so (6,1) occupied.\n\nAfter Bob moves, it might be free.\n\nTurn 13:\nAlice: I (place on (3,2))\nBob: W to (5,1)\n\nTurn 14:\nAlice: U (face north)\nBob: W to (4,1)  // now (6,1) empty\n\nTurn 15:\nAlice: I (grab onion)\nBob: D (face south)\n\nTurn 16:\nAlice: E to (4,3)  // at (4,3) facing east\nBob: I (add onion to (4,0))  // pot has one, Bob empty at (4,1) facing south\n\nTurn 17:\nAlice: at (4,3) facing east, she can S to face south (Change Orientation S)\nBob: can stay or move\n\nAlice: Change Orientation S to face south\n\nTurn 18:\nAlice: I to place onion on (4,2)  // place on (4,2), Alice empty\nBob: at (4,1) he can U to face north (Change Orientation U)\n\nTurn 19:\nAlice: U to face north (Change Orientation U)\nBob: I to pick up onion from (4,2)  // Bob holding onion\n\nTurn 20:\nAlice: I to grab onion from (4,4)  // Alice holding onion\nBob: D to face south (Change Orientation D)\n\nTurn 21:\nAlice: holding onion, she can move to (4,1) but occupied, so she can go to (3,3) or something.\nBob: I to add onion to pot  // pot had one, now adds second, so two onions\n\nAt this point, pot has two onions, Alice has an onion at (4,3), Bob at (4,1) empty.\n\nAlice can place the onion on (4,2) again, but (4,2) may be empty after Bob picked up at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19 Bob picked up from (4,2), so (4,2) empty.\n\nTurn 21 Alice: Change Orientation S to face south (if not already), then I to place on (4,2)\n\nTurn 22 Alice: placed, empty\n\nThen Bob can pick it up and add.\n\nTurn 22 Bob: U to face north (he is at (4,1) facing south after adding)\n\nTurn 23 Bob: I to pick up from (4,2)\n\nTurn 24 Bob: D to face south\n\nTurn 25 Bob: I to add to pot  // third onion, cooking starts\n\nThen at turn 25 cooking starts.\n\nBut for Alice, from turn 13 to say turn 22, she has actions.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns, Alice can help start the soup.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob, but the answer format is for Alice's actions.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the answer format, only Alice's actions are listed, so perhaps we assume Bob is controlled separately or we suggest.\n\nBut for simplicity, plan Alice's actions based on current state.\n\nAt turn 13, Alice can place the onion on the counter to free her hand, then get another onion.\n\nThen she can move towards the serving area or plate dispenser.\n\nBut soup not started.\n\nTo maximize reward, we should start cooking quickly.\n\nThe shortest way: Alice and Bob both add their onions to the same pot, but they need to be at the same location.\n\nFor example, if both go to (4,1).\n\nBut Alice is far.\n\nBob can add his onion to pot at (4,0) as before.\n\nAlice can add her onion to pot at (3,0) but it's far.\n\nPot at (3,0) is closer to Alice? Not really.\n\n(3,0) and (3,3), but blocked.\n\nAlice at (3,3) to (3,1): as before, 5 moves.\n\nThen add.\n\nSo at turn 13 Alice: W to (2,3)\n\nTurn 14: W to (1,3)\n\nTurn 15: S to (1,2)\n\nTurn 16: S to (1,1)\n\nTurn 17: E to (2,1)\n\nTurn 18: E to (3,1)\n\nTurn 19: D to face south\n\nTurn 20: I to add onion to (3,0)  // pot has one onion\n\nThen she can go get another onion.\n\nBut Bob can add his to the same pot.\n\nBob at (6,1) to (3,1): W to (5,1), W to (4,1), W to (3,1) 3 moves.\n\nAt turn 13 Bob: W to (5,1)\n\nTurn 14: W to (4,1)\n\nTurn 15: W to (3,1)\n\nThen at (3,1), he can add to pot at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nIf to (3,0), he can D to face south, I to add.\n\nBut at turn 15, Alice is at (1,3) or something.\n\nNot synchronized.\n\nI think the initial approach with counters is better for saving time.\n\nFor the sake of completing, let's assume Alice's actions for the next 10 turns.\n\nAt turn 13, Alice places onion on counter to free hand, then gets another onion, then moves towards the pot area.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 13: Alice I (place on (3,2))\n\nTurn 14: Alice U (face north)\n\nTurn 15: Alice I (grab onion)\n\nThen she moves towards (4,1) via (4,3), (5,3), etc., but since (6,1) may be occupied, she can go to (4,3) first.\n\nTurn 16: Alice E to (4,3)  // move east to (4,3), facing east\n\nThen she can try to go south, but not possible, so Turn 17: E to (5,3)  // move east to (5,3), facing east\n\nTurn 18: E to (6,3)  // move east to (6,3), facing east\n\nTurn 19: S to (6,2)  // move south to (6,2), facing south\n\nTurn 20: if (6,1) empty, S to (6,1), else Stay or something.\n\nBut at turn 19, Bob might be elsewhere.\n\nSince we don't control Bob, we can assume he is moving.\n\nFor the plan, we can list Alice's actions.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns, Alice can prepare for the soup.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can go directly to the plate dispenser to get a plate, but soup not started, so not useful.\n\nOr she can deliver if there is soup, but pots are empty.\n\nSo must start cooking.\n\nI think for turn 13 to turn 22, Alice can do the following to contribute:\n\nTurn 13: I (place onion on (3,2) to free hand)\n\nTurn 14: U (face north to prepare for dispenser)\n\nTurn 15: I (grab new onion from dispenser)\n\nNow she has an onion, and there is an onion on (3,2).\n\nThen she can move towards a pot, say to (3,1) for pot at (3,0).\n\nTurn 16: W to (2,3)  // move west to (2,3), facing west\n\nTurn 17: W to (1,3)  // move west to (1,3), facing west\n\nTurn 18: S to (1,2)  // move south to (1,2), facing south\n\nTurn 19: S to (1,1)  // move south to (1,1), facing south\n\nTurn 20: E to (2,1)  // move east to (2,1), facing east\n\nTurn 21: E to (3,1)  // move east to (3,1), facing east\n\nTurn 22: D to face south to prepare for pot interaction.\n\nThen later she can add the onion.\n\nBut this is for Alice only.\n\nBob can be adding his onion or something.\n\nBut with this, at least the onion on (3,2) can be used by Bob or Alice later.\n\nFor the answer, I think we need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps H is short, say 5 turns.\n\nBut 5 turns not enough to do much.\n\nAt turn 13, Alice can place the onion, then face north, then grab new onion, so in 3 turns, she has an onion, and one on counter.\n\nThen she can stay or move.\n\nBut let's box the answer for Alice for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", but not specified, let's assume H=5 for simplicity.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 13: I (interact to place onion on (3,2))\n\nTurn 14: U (change orientation to face up)\n\nTurn 15: I (interact to grab onion from dispenser)\n\nTurn 16: S (change orientation to face down, to potentially interact with counter again, but it has no item, or move)\n\nBut at turn 16, she can move east to (4,3).\n\nTurn 16: E (move east to (4,3))\n\nThen Turn 17: S (change orientation to face south to be ready to place on (4,2) if needed)\n\nBut for H=5, up to turn 17 or 18.\n\nTurn 13 to turn 17 is 5 actions: t13,14,15,16,17.\n\nTurn t1=13, actions for t=13 to t=17.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: I\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: I\n\nTurn 16: E\n\nTurn 17: S (change orientation south)\n\nThen she can place on (4,2) at turn 18 if she does I.\n\nBut for H=5, up to turn 17.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = I\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = I\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = E\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = S  (face south)\n\nIn the answer format, it's for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, with H turns.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=1 to H-1\" let's read.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=1 to H-1\" no.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=1 to H-1\" for t from 1 to H-1, that would be H-1 actions.\n\n\" {a_{t1 + t} }_{t=1}^{H-1} \" so for t from 1 to H-1, so actions from t1+1 to t1+H-1, missing t1.\n\nLet's see: \"{a_{t1 + t}_{t=1}^{H-1}\" so for t=1, a_{t1+1}, t=2, a_{t1+2}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t1+H-1}, so it starts from t1+1, not t1.\n\nBut at turn t1, we need to specify a_{t1}.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" then \"Turn t1 + 1: a_{t1 + 1}\" etc., so it includes t1.\n\nThe text says: \"{a_{t1 + t}_{t=1}^{H-1}\" but that starts from t1+1.\n\nPerhaps t from 0 to H-1.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=1 to H-1\" but in the box, it shows \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" so it includes t1.\n\nI think it's inconsistent.\n\nIn the task: \"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=1 to H-1\" but for t=1, a_{t1+1}, so it starts from t1+1.\n\nBut in the example box, it has \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" so I think there's confusion.\n\nPerhaps it's for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nTo be safe, I'll include from t1.\n\nFor Alice, at turn 13, she can place the onion to free hand, then face north, then grab new onion.\n\nSo for the next 3 turns.\n\nBut let's say for 5 actions from turn 13 to 17.\n\nTurn 13: I\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: I\n\nTurn 16: E  (move to (4,3))\n\nTurn 17: C Change orientation S to face south\n\nThen she is ready to place on (4,2) at turn 18.\n\nBut for the sequence, up to turn 17.\n\nSo I think that's reasonable.\n\nBob can be adding his onion to the pot.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: I\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: I\nTurn 16: E\nTurn 17: S\n}\n\nS is Stay or South? Actions are U,D,L,R,I,S, S is Stay.\n\nIn the list, S is Stay, not south.\n\nOrientation change is with U,D,L,R for direction.\n\nActions: Move (L/R/U/D), Change Orientation (L/R/U/D), Interact (I), Stay (S).\n\nSo for Change Orientation, it's specified as L/R/U/D for the direction.\n\nFor Move, it's L/R/U/D for move and face that direction.\n\nFor Stay, S.\n\nIn Turn 17, I have S, which is Stay, but I meant Change Orientation to south, which is D for down.\n\nChange Orientation D to face down.\n\nSo it should be D for Change Orientation down.\n\nSimilarly, Move E is R for right.\n\nLet's use the action symbols.\n\nFor Alice at turn 13: Interact to place on counter.\n\nAction: I\n\nTurn 14: Change Orientation to up, so U for Change Orientation.\n\nAction: U (Change Orientation up)\n\nTurn 15: Interact to grab onion, I\n\nTurn 16: Move east, so R (move right to (4,3))\n\nAction: R\n\nTurn 17: Change Orientation to south, so D for Change Orientation down.\n\nAction: D\n\nThen she is at (4,3) facing south, ready to interact with (4,2) if needed.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 13: I\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: I\n\nTurn 16: R\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nFor the box.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivering onion soup, Alice and Bob need to coordinate to gather ingredients, start cooking as soon as possible, and eventually serve the soup. Given the current state (turn 13), Alice is at (3,3) holding an onion, facing down, and Bob is at (6,1) holding an onion, facing down. Both pots are empty, and all kitchen counters are empty. The recipe requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and yields a 20-point reward.\n\n### Coordination Strategy:\n- **Alice's Role**: Alice is near the onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). She should free her hands to gather additional onions efficiently. After placing her current onion on the adjacent kitchen counter at (3,2), she grabs a new onion from the dispenser. She then moves toward the pot area to contribute ingredients or assist with cooking.\n- **Bob's Role**: Bob is closer to the pots. He should add his onion to a pot (e.g., at (4,0)) directly, then retrieve onions from counters or dispensers to complete the recipe. With Alice gathering onions, Bob can focus on pot interactions.\n- **Key Optimization**: \n  - Start cooking quickly by using kitchen counters for temporary storage to avoid unnecessary movement.\n  - Alice's actions for the next 5 turns (turns 13-17) focus on preparing and moving toward the pot area, while Bob is expected to add his onion to a pot and help complete the ingredient count.\n  - Cooking can start by turn 20-25 with this coordination, allowing soup to be ready for serving around turn 25-30.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 13-17):\n- **Turn 13**: Alice interacts (I) to place her onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2). This frees her hand and stores an onion for later use.\n- **Turn 14**: Alice changes orientation to up (U) to face the onion dispenser at (3,4).\n- **Turn 15**: Alice interacts (I) to grab a new onion from the dispenser. She now holds an onion and has one stored on the counter.\n- **Turn 16**: Alice moves east (R) to position (4,3). This positions her closer to the pot at (4,0) and the other onion dispenser.\n- **Turn 17**: Alice changes orientation to down (D) to face the kitchen counter at (4,2). She can interact with it next to place her onion if needed for Bob to pick up.\n\n### Expected Outcome with Bob's Actions:\n- Bob should move west to (5,1) on turn 13, then to (4,1) on turn 14. On turn 15, he changes orientation to down and adds his onion to the pot at (4,0) on turn 16 (pot now has 1 onion). \n- By turn 18-19, Bob can pick up the onion from (3,2) or (4,2) (placed by Alice) and add it to the pot. Alice can provide a third onion from the dispenser or by moving to the pot area.\n- With 3 onions in a pot by turn 20-25, cooking starts. After 5 turns, the soup can be served using a plate from the dispenser at (0,2), delivered to (7,2) for 20 points.\n\nThis sequence ensures efficient use of turns, minimizes idle time, and leverages Alice's position near resources. Planning beyond turn 17 would involve Alice moving to (4,1) or interacting to place onions for Bob, then fetching plates.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: I \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: I \\\\\nTurn 16: R \\\\\nTurn 17: D\n}",

There are no tomatoes in this level, since the tomato dispensers are listed as \"no tomato dispensers,\" so we can only make onion soup.\n\nKey elements:\n\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter at (7,2)\n\n- Kitchen counters with items: only (1,0) has an onion.\n\nCurrent state at turn 18:\n\n- Alice: at (1,1), facing down (D), holding nothing. Action history: L, L, D, D, I. I need to see what these actions might imply, but it's the last few actions.\n\n- Bob: at (3,1), facing right (R), holding one onion. Action history: L, L, L, L, R.\n\nAlice just did an 'I' (interact) at the end of her history. Since she's at (1,1) facing down, and below her is (1,0), which is a kitchen counter with an onion, she probably interacted with that counter. But she's holding nothing now, so she might have picked up the onion or tried to place something? The kitchen counter at (1,0) has an onion, so if she interacted while facing down towards (1,0), she could have picked up that onion. But her action history ends with 'I', and now she's holding nothing. If she picked it up, she should be holding it, but she's not. Let me read the interact rules.\n\nInteract: can pick up items from dispensers, counters, etc., if empty-handed.\n\nIf she was at (1,1) facing down to (1,0), which has an onion, and she was empty-handed, she should have picked up the onion. But now she's holding nothing. That doesn't make sense. Unless the action history includes the action that led to this state.\n\nThe action history is for the past turns, and the current state is after these actions. So after her last action 'I', she is now holding nothing. But if she interacted with (1,0) which had an onion, and she picked it up, she should be holding it. But she's not. Contradiction.\n\nPerhaps she didn't pick it up because of some reason. Or maybe she placed something, but she was holding nothing before, so she couldn't place. I'm confused.\n\nLet's list the positions step by step based on action history.\n\nAlice action history: L, L, D, D, I\n\nStart from some position, but I don't know where she was before. The history is at most the last 5 actions, and current turn is 18, so actions from turn 13 to 17, I think, and turn 18 is the next one to plan? No.\n\nThe task says: at turn t1=18, plan actions for t1 and onwards. t1 is the current turn, so we need to plan for turn 18, 19, etc.\n\nThe current state is given at turn 18, after all actions up to turn 17 have been executed. I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Game Turn: t_1 = 18\" and \"Current Game State\" so this is the state at the beginning of turn 18, before any action is taken for turn 18.\n\nThe action history is the actions taken in previous turns, leading to this state.\n\nFor Alice: actions L, L, D, D, I. These are for turns, say, 13 to 17? But not specified which turns, just the sequence.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nAfter these actions, Alice is at (1,1), facing D, holding nothing.\n\nBob at (3,1), facing R, holding one onion.\n\nKitchen counter (1,0) has an onion.\n\nNow, Alice's last action was 'I' at turn 17, I assume.\n\nSince she is at (1,1) facing D, she must have interacted with (1,0), which is adjacent and she is facing it.\n\n(1,0) is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\nIf she was empty-handed before interacting, she should have picked up the onion, but now she is holding nothing, so that can't be.\n\nUnless the interaction failed for some reason, but the rules don't say anything about failure except for conditions not met.\n\nInteract conditions: player must be on empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it.\n\n(1,1) is empty tile, I assume, since players can be there, and it's not listed as non-empty.\n\nTile types: kitchen counters are at specific locations, but (1,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it should be empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice at (1,1) facing D, so adjacent to (1,0) and facing it, so she can interact.\n\nIf she was holding nothing, she should be able to pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nBut after interaction, she is holding nothing. That implies she did not pick it up, or perhaps she did something else.\n\nMaybe she was holding something before the interaction, and she placed it on the counter.\n\nBut her action history: before 'I', she had D, D, L, L.\n\nLet's trace her position.\n\nSuppose before the last 5 actions, she was at some position.\n\nFor example, action history: L, L, D, D, I.\n\nLet's assume the actions are in order from oldest to recent or recent to oldest? The problem says: \"action history is a list of actions taken by the player in the passed several turns(at most 5), with the most recent action listed at the end of the array.\"\n\nSo for Alice: actions L, L, D, D, I with I being the most recent.\n\nSo at turn 17, she did 'I'.\n\nBefore that, at turn 16, she did D (down), so she moved to (1,1) from (1,2)? Let's define coordinates.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4? Based on tile positions.\n\nFor example, kitchen counters at (0,0) to (7,0) etc., but let's list all for reference.\n\nTile types:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion Dispenser: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pot: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nAlso, (0,1) is kitchen counter, but it might be empty.\n\nAlice at (1,1), which is not listed in any, so it's empty tile.\n\nBob at (3,1), also not listed, empty tile.\n\nNow, Alice action history: L, L, D, D, I\n\nStart from some position before turn 13 or whenever.\n\nSince she is at (1,1) after D, D, I.\n\nAfter turn 16: she did D (down), so she moved down. Before that, she was at (1,2) or something.\n\nAssume at turn 15, she did D (down), so from (1,2) to (1,1)? But (1,2) is what? Not listed, so empty.\n\nThen at turn 16, she did D again, but from (1,1) down to (1,0)? (1,0) is a kitchen counter, which is not walkable, so she cannot move onto it. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles.\n\nSo if she is at (1,1) and tries to move D to (1,0), it's not empty, so she can't move there. The move action would fail or she doesn't move? The rules say: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" But it also says: \"Cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nSo if she tries to move to a non-empty tile, she doesn't move, but the action is still taken, I assume, but position doesn't change.\n\nSimilarly for orientation change.\n\nFor Alice, at turn 16, she did D (down). But from (1,1), down to (1,0) is not empty, so she cannot move there. Therefore, she stays at (1,1) and her orientation changes to D? The move action changes position and orientation, but if move is invalid, does it change orientation?\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nBut with constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if the target tile is non-empty, the move fails, and position doesn't change. What about orientation? The action is to move, which includes changing orientation to that direction, but since move fails, it might not change orientation.\n\nThe rules don't specify. Similarly for change orientation action.\n\nThere is a separate \"Change Orientation\" action: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is confusing.\n\nLet's read the player actions:\n\n\"Each player can:\n\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1,y), U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1).\n\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. \"\n\nThe \"Change Orientation\" action says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That seems misplaced.\n\nIt says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But change orientation shouldn't involve moving; it should only change facing.\n\nI think there might be a typo or misphrasing.\n\nLet me read the full sentence: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut that doesn't make sense for changing orientation. Probably it's a mistake.\n\nPerhaps it means that for interact, but it's listed under change orientation.\n\nLook: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nFor change orientation, it should be separate.\n\nI think the \"no move if...\" part is for the move action or something else.\n\nLet's assume that for move action, if the target tile is not empty, the move fails, and position doesn't change, but orientation might change to the direction, or not specified.\n\nTo simplify, I think in such games, if you try to move to an invalid tile, you don't move, and orientation might change to that direction or not.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let's look at Alice's actions.\n\nAlice action history: L, L, D, D, I\n\nCurrent position: (1,1), facing D.\n\nAfter the last D (down) at turn 16, she was at (1,1) and tried to move down to (1,0), but (1,0) is kitchen counter with onion, not empty, so she couldn't move, so she stayed at (1,1). Did her orientation change to D? Probably, since she attempted to move down.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 15, she did D (down), from where? Before that, she had L, L.\n\nAssume at turn 14, she did L (left), so from (2,1) to (1,1)? (2,1) is not listed, so empty.\n\nLet's trace back.\n\nSuppose at turn 13, Alice was at some position.\n\nAfter turn 13 action: L (left). If she was at (2,1), she moves to (1,1), orientation L (left).\n\nThen turn 14: L (left) again. From (1,1) left to (0,1). (0,1) is a kitchen counter, not empty, so she cannot move to (0,1), so she stays at (1,1), and orientation changes to L (left)? Or not.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the orientation change happens only if the move is successful, or always.\n\nTo make it simple, let's assume that for move action, if the move is invalid, position doesn't change, and orientation changes to the direction of the move attempt.\n\nSimilarly for change orientation action, it only changes orientation without moving.\n\nBut for Alice, the actions are move or interact, no change orientation listed separately.\n\nIn the action list, it's U,D,L,R for move or change orientation? The actions are specified as U,D,L,R for move, and separately for change orientation, but in the history, it's listed as U,D,L,R,I,S, so U,D,L,R could be for move or for change orientation? But the action is the same symbol, so we don't know if it's a move or orientation change.\n\nThe action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}, and U,D,L,R can be either a move or a orientation change, depending on context.\n\nThe rules say: \"Move (L/R/U/D)\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" as separate actions, but they share the same symbols.\n\nIn the action history, when we see 'L', it could be a move left or change orientation to left.\n\nBut we don't know which one it was.\n\nFor example, in Alice's history: L, L, D, D, I\n\nThe first L could be move left or change orientation left.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps from the context and current state, we can infer.\n\nCurrent state: Alice at (1,1), facing D.\n\nLast action was 'I' at turn 17.\n\nBefore that, 'D' at turn 16.\n\nAfter turn 16 action 'D', she is at (1,1) facing D.\n\nIf 'D' was a move down, and she was at (1,2) before, she moved to (1,1), orientation D.\n\nOr if she was at (1,1), and 'D' was move down, but (1,0) not empty, so she stays, orientation changes to D.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 15, she did 'D', so if she was at (1,2), she moved down to (1,1) or something.\n\nLet's assume that at turn 15, she did 'D' (move down). If she was at (1,2), she moves to (1,1), orientation D.\n\nThen at turn 16, she did 'D' again, but from (1,1) to (1,0) not possible, so she stays at (1,1), orientation changes to D (already D, so no change or remains D).\n\nThen at turn 17, she did 'I' (interact), at (1,1) facing D, so she interacts with (1,0).\n\n(1,0) has an onion, and she was empty-handed, so she should pick up the onion.\n\nBut after this, at current state turn 18, she is holding nothing. That's the contradiction.\n\nUnless she didn't pick it up because the counter was empty or something, but it says kitchen counter on (1,0) contains an onion.\n\nPerhaps the interaction was to place something, but she was holding nothing, so nothing happened.\n\nOr maybe she was holding something before the interaction.\n\nBut her action history shows she was moving, so she might have been holding something.\n\nBefore turn 15, she had 'L' at turn 14 and 'L' at turn 13.\n\nSuppose at turn 13, she did 'L' (move left or change orientation).\n\nIf she was at (2,1), and 'L' move left, she moves to (1,1), orientation L.\n\nThen turn 14, 'L' again, from (1,1) move left to (0,1), but (0,1) is kitchen counter, not empty, so she stays at (1,1), orientation changes to L.\n\nThen turn 15, 'D' move down, from (1,1) to (1,0) not possible, so stays, orientation to D.\n\nTurn 16, 'D' again, stays, orientation D.\n\nTurn 17, 'I' interact with (1,0), but she is at (1,1) facing D, so she can interact.\n\nSince she was empty-handed (we don't know what she was holding before, but at turn 18 she is empty-handed), and (1,0) has onion, she should pick it up, but she is not holding it now. So perhaps the interaction didn't happen or failed, but rules don't say why.\n\nAnother possibility: when she did 'I', she was not facing the tile or something, but she is facing D and (1,0) is below, so she should be facing it.\n\nPerhaps (1,0) is not adjacent or something, but (1,1) and (1,0) are adjacent vertically.\n\nI think there's a mistake in my reasoning or in the state.\n\nPerhaps the kitchen counter at (1,0) has an onion, but when Alice interacted, she picked it up, so now the counter is empty, and Alice is holding the onion. But the current state says Alice is holding nothing, and the kitchen counter on (1,0) contains an onion, so it still has it, so Alice did not pick it up.\n\nWhy?\n\nOne reason could be that she was not empty-handed at the time of interaction. But we don't know what she was holding before.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, after 'D', she might have been holding something, then at turn 17 'I', she interacted with (1,0). If she was holding something, she could place it on the counter if it was empty, but (1,0) had an onion, so it was occupied, so she cannot place, and since she is holding something, she cannot pick up, so interaction does nothing.\n\nThen she is still holding whatever she had.\n\nBut at turn 18, she is holding nothing, so she must have been holding nothing before 'I', so why didn't she pick up the onion?\n\nUnless the counter was empty at that time, but the state says it contains an onion now.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps for Bob's action, something happened.\n\nBob's action history: L, L, L, L, R\n\nBob position: (3,1), facing R, holding one onion.\n\nLast action 'R' at turn 17.\n\nBefore that 'L' at turn 16, etc.\n\nWith 'L' and 'R', it could be move or orientation change.\n\nCurrent facing R.\n\nAfter last action 'R', he is facing R.\n\nIf 'R' was move right, from (2,1) to (3,1), or from (3,1) to (4,1), but (4,1) not listed, so empty, possible.\n\nOr if 'R' was orientation change to right.\n\nSimilarly, previous actions.\n\nBut I don't think it helps with Alice's issue.\n\nPerhaps the kitchen counter at (1,0) has an onion, but Alice was not able to interact because of some reason, or the action history is incomplete.\n\nTo move forward, I'll assume that for some reason, Alice did not pick up the onion at turn 17, and now at turn 18, she is at (1,1) facing D, holding nothing, and (1,0) has onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (3,1) facing R, holding one onion.\n\nPots are empty.\n\nGoal: make onion soup and deliver it.\n\nRecipe: 3 onions, cook for 5 turns, reward 20.\n\nWe need to fill a pot with 3 onions, let it cook, then serve with a plate.\n\nPlayers can carry one item at a time.\n\nThere is a plate dispenser at (0,2), onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nKitchen counter at (1,0) has an onion, which can be used.\n\nAlice is at (1,1), so she can easily access (1,0) to pick up that onion.\n\nShe is facing D, so she is already facing (1,0), so she can interact with it immediately.\n\nBob is at (3,1) holding an onion. He can go to a pot to add it.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\n(3,0) is directly below (3,1), so if Bob moves down to (3,0), but (3,0) is a pot, which is not empty, so he cannot walk onto it. He needs to be adjacent and facing to interact.\n\nBob is at (3,1), facing R (east). To interact with (3,0) below, he needs to face down and be at a tile adjacent, which he is, since (3,1) is above (3,0).\n\nSo he can change orientation to down and interact to add the onion to the pot.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nLet's plan for turn 18 onwards.\n\nFirst, Alice can interact with (1,0) to pick up the onion there, since she is at (1,1) facing D, so for turn 18, she can do 'I' to pick up the onion from (1,0).\n\nAfter that, she will be holding an onion.\n\nThen she needs to go to a pot to add it.\n\nNearest pot is (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nFrom (1,1) to (3,0), she can move right to (2,1), then down to (2,0)? (2,0) is kitchen counter, not empty, so she cannot move to (2,0). She needs to go around.\n\nPath: from (1,1) she can move right to (2,1), which is empty, then from (2,1) she can move right to (3,1), but Bob is at (3,1), so she cannot move there because players cannot walk onto each other.\n\nBob is at (3,1), so (3,1) is occupied by Bob, so Alice cannot move to (3,1).\n\nShe can go up or down, but down to (1,0) not possible.\n\nFrom (1,1), she can move up to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, so empty, but let's see the grid.\n\nList the walkable tiles.\n\nThe grid has x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4.\n\nKitchen counters are at specific points, so other tiles are empty and walkable, except for dispensers, pots, etc., but dispensers and pots are also tiles that can be interacted with but not walked on.\n\nTile types: empty tiles are walkable, dispensers, pots, counters are not walkable; players can only be on empty tiles.\n\nSo for example, (1,1) is empty, walkable.\n\n(1,0) is kitchen counter with item, not walkable.\n\n(2,1) should be empty, not listed.\n\n(3,1) has Bob, so occupied, not walkable for Alice.\n\n(4,1) empty, etc.\n\nAlice at (1,1). To go to a pot, say (3,0).\n\nShe can move right to (2,1), which is empty.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move down? (2,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she cannot move down.\n\nShe can move right to (3,1), but Bob is there, so occupied, cannot.\n\nShe can move up to (2,2)? (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(2,2) is listed as kitchen counter, so not empty.\n\nSo from (2,1), she can only move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1) but occupied, or up to (2,2) not walkable, or down to (2,0) not walkable. So (2,1) is a dead end if surrounded, but let's see the grid.\n\nActually, (2,1) can move up? (2,2) is kitchen counter, so no.\n\nMove down? (2,0) kitchen counter, no.\n\nMove left to (1,1), move right to (3,1) but occupied.\n\nSo Alice can only move to (2,1) from (1,1), but from (2,1) she can only go back to (1,1) or if (3,1) free, to (3,1), but not now.\n\nShe can go up from (1,1) to (1,2), if (1,2) is empty.\n\n(1,2) not listed in any non-empty, so it should be empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) etc.\n\nFrom (1,1), she can move up to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is empty, I assume.\n\nThen from (1,2), she can move right to (2,2), but (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nMove up to (1,3)? (1,3) not listed, so empty.\n\ny-coordinates: y=0 to 4.\n\n(1,3) should be empty.\n\nThen from (1,3), she can move right to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut that seems long to go to a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), both at y=0.\n\nAlice is at (1,1), so to reach (3,0), she can go to (3,1) first, but Bob is there.\n\nBob is at (3,1), so Alice needs to go around.\n\nFirst, for turn 18, Alice should pick up the onion from (1,0) since she is facing it and can interact.\n\nSo for turn 18, Alice action: I (interact with (1,0) to pick up onion).\n\nAfter that, she will be holding an onion.\n\nThen she needs to go to a pot.\n\nBob is at (3,1) holding an onion, facing R.\n\nHe can add his onion to a pot.\n\nNearest pot is (3,0) below him.\n\nHe is facing R, not down, so he needs to change orientation to down to face (3,0).\n\nThen interact to add onion.\n\nSo for Bob, at turn 18, he can change orientation to down.\n\nBut the actions are U,D,L,R,I,S, so to change orientation to down, he can do 'D', which could be move down or change orientation down.\n\nBut if he does 'D' as move down, from (3,1) to (3,0), but (3,0) is pot, not empty, so he cannot move there. So if he does 'D' as move, it fails, and he might change orientation to D or not.\n\nTo be safe, he should do a orientation change action.\n\nBut the action for change orientation is also 'D' for down, so it's the same symbol.\n\nIn planning, we can specify the action, and assume that if the move is invalid, it can be considered as orientation change, or vice versa.\n\nTo avoid confusion, for Bob to face down, he can perform a 'D' action. Since moving down is invalid, it will be an orientation change to down.\n\nSimilarly, in general, when a player tries to move to an invalid tile, it acts as orientation change to that direction.\n\nI think that's a common way to handle it.\n\nSo for Bob at (3,1), if he does 'D', he cannot move to (3,0), so he changes orientation to down.\n\nThen he is facing (3,0).\n\nThen he can interact to add the onion.\n\nSo for turn 18, Bob can do 'D' to face down.\n\nThen for turn 19, he can do 'I' to add onion to pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, for Alice, at turn 18, do 'I' to pick up onion from (1,0).\n\nAfter turn 18, Alice at (1,1) holding onion, facing D (since she didn't move).\n\nBob at (3,1) facing D, holding onion? After turn 18, Bob did 'D', so he is now facing down, still at (3,1), holding onion.\n\nThen turn 19, Bob does 'I' to add onion to pot at (3,0). Since he is facing it and adjacent, he can interact, add onion, now pot has one onion, Bob is empty-handed.\n\nAlice, after picking up onion, she needs to go to a pot.\n\nBut pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), both occupied or not.\n\n(3,0) is being used, and (4,0) is free.\n\nBut Alice is far.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (4,0), for example.\n\nFirst, she needs to move to a position where she can access a pot.\n\nSince (3,0) will have one onion after Bob adds, it needs two more.\n\n(4,0) is empty.\n\nAlice can go to (4,0) to add her onion.\n\nBut (4,0) is at (4,0), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFor example, from above at (4,1), or left at (3,0) but (3,0) is pot, not walkable.\n\nSo she can go to (4,1) and face down.\n\nNow, Alice at (1,1), holding onion.\n\nBob is at (3,1), after adding onion, he will be at (3,1) empty.\n\nPath for Alice to (4,1).\n\nFrom (1,1) to (4,1): she can move right to (2,1), but (2,1) is empty, but then to (3,1), which after Bob adds, at turn 19, Bob is at (3,1), so still occupied.\n\nAt turn 19, Bob is at (3,1) after adding onion.\n\nAlice at (1,1) after turn 18, holding onion.\n\nTurn 19: Alice can move right to (2,1), since (2,1) is empty.\n\nShe moves to (2,1), orientation right? When she moves right, orientation changes to R.\n\nNow at (2,1), facing R.\n\nThen turn 20, she can move right to (3,1), but (3,1) has Bob, so she cannot, or if Bob moves away.\n\nBob, after adding onion at turn 19, is at (3,1) empty-handed.\n\nHe can move to get another onion or something.\n\nBut let's sequence the actions.\n\nAlso, we need to fill the pot with three onions.\n\nAfter Bob adds one onion at (3,0), pot has one onion.\n\nWe need two more.\n\nAlice has one, so she can add it.\n\nBut she needs to reach the pot.\n\nBob can get another onion from dispenser or from counter.\n\nThere is onion at (1,0), but Alice just picked it up, so (1,0) is now empty? When Alice does 'I' at turn 18, she picks up the onion, so (1,0) becomes empty, and Alice holds onion.\n\nSo no onion on counter now.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nNow, for the soup, we need to cook for 5 turns after adding third onion.\n\nThen serve with plate.\n\nPlan for H turns, say H=10 or something, but not specified, so we need to plan a sequence to complete one soup or more.\n\nFirst, let's get the pot filled.\n\nPot at (3,0) has one onion after Bob adds.\n\nAlice has one onion to add.\n\nBut Alice is at (1,1) after turn 18, then at turn 19 she moves to (2,1), then at turn 20, if Bob is still at (3,1), she cannot move to (3,1).\n\nBob should move away.\n\nFor example, after Bob adds onion at turn 19, he can move to (4,1) or something.\n\nThen Alice can move to (3,1) at turn 20.\n\nThen from (3,1), she can face down to (3,0) and add onion.\n\nBut she needs to face down first.\n\nLet's list actions turn by turn.\n\nTurn 18:\n\n- Alice: I (interact with (1,0) to pick up onion) → now holding onion, position (1,1), facing D\n\n- Bob: D (change orientation to down, since move down invalid) → now at (3,1), facing D, holding onion\n\nTurn 19:\n\n- Alice: move right to (2,1) → position (2,1), orientation R (right)\n\n- Bob: I (interact with (3,0) to add onion) → now pot at (3,0) has one onion, Bob holding nothing, position (3,1), facing D\n\nNow pot has one onion.\n\nBob is empty, at (3,1) facing down.\n\nHe can stay or move to get another item.\n\nAlice at (2,1) holding onion, facing right.\n\nShe wants to go to (3,1) to access the pot, but Bob is there.\n\nSo Bob needs to move.\n\nFor turn 20:\n\n- Bob can move right to (4,1) → position (4,1), orientation R (since he moves right)\n\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) → now (3,1) is free, so she moves to (3,1), orientation R\n\nAfter this, Alice at (3,1), facing R, holding onion.\n\nShe needs to face down to interact with pot.\n\nTurn 21:\n\n- Alice: D (change orientation to down, since move down invalid) → now facing D\n\n- Bob: at (4,1), facing R, holding nothing. He can go to get another onion for the pot or for another pot.\n\nPot at (3,0) has one onion, needs two more.\n\nAlice is about to add one, so after she adds, it will have two.\n\nThen need one more.\n\nBob can get an onion from dispenser.\n\nOnion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4).\n\nBob at (4,1), he can go to (4,4) to get onion.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nThere is another pot at (4,0), which is empty.\n\nPerhaps better to use both pots or one.\n\nBut since we have limited time, focus on one soup first.\n\nAfter Alice adds, pot has two onions, need one more.\n\nAlice can add at turn 21.\n\nTurn 21:\n\n- Alice: after facing down, she can do I to add onion to pot → now pot has two onions, Alice holding nothing\n\n- Bob: at (4,1), facing R, he can move down? (4,0) is pot, not walkable, so he can change orientation to down to face (4,0), or move elsewhere.\n\nFor now, let him go to onion dispenser.\n\nBut (4,1) to (4,4), he can move up.\n\ny=1 to y=4, so move up three times.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nAfter turn 21, pot at (3,0) has two onions.\n\nNeed one more onion to start cooking.\n\nCooking starts automatically when three ingredients are added.\n\nNow, Bob is at (4,1), facing R, empty.\n\nHe can go to an onion dispenser to get an onion.\n\nNearest is (4,4) or (3,4), but (4,4) is closer in x, same x=4.\n\nFrom (4,1), move up to (4,2), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(4,2) is listed as kitchen counter, so not empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2), (5,2) etc.\n\nSo from (4,1), he can move up to (4,2)? No, not walkable.\n\nMove left to (3,1), but Alice might be there or not.\n\nAfter turn 21, Alice is at (3,1) facing D, holding nothing.\n\n(3,1) is occupied by Alice.\n\nBob at (4,1), he can move right to (5,1)? (5,1) not listed, so empty, or move down not possible.\n\nMove right to (5,1), then from there to (5,2) but (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nHe needs to go around to reach y=4.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), move right to (5,1), then up to (5,2) not possible, so move to (6,1) or something.\n\ny=4 is the top row.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nTo access (3,4), player needs to be at (3,3) or (2,4) etc, but let's see adjacent tiles.\n\n(3,4) dispenser, player can be at (3,3) and face up, or (4,4) etc.\n\n(3,3) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) empty.\n\nFrom Bob at (4,1), he can move up, but (4,2) is counter, not walkable, so he cannot go directly up.\n\nHe can move left to (3,1), but occupied, or right to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is empty.\n\nThen from (5,1), he can move up to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo cannot go up.\n\nThe only way is to go to a row where y=2 is walkable, but y=2 has counters at (2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2), so all are counters, so no walkable tile at y=2 except possibly ends, but (0,2) is plate dispenser, (1,2) not listed, so empty? (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list, so it should be empty tile.\n\nKitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), so (1,2) and (6,2), (7,2) are not listed, but (7,2) is serving counter, so not walkable.\n\n(6,2) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) not listed, so empty tile.\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo at y=2, only (1,2) and (6,2) are walkable? (1,2) and (6,2), and (7,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\n(0,2) dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo for Bob to go to y=4, he needs to go to a column where he can go up to y=3 then y=4.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), he can move right to (5,1), then right to (6,1), then up to (6,2), which is empty, then up to (6,3)? (6,3) not listed, so empty, then up to (6,4), but (6,4) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(6,4) is kitchen counter, so not empty.\n\nPlayer can be at (6,3) and face up to interact with (6,4)? But (6,4) is kitchen counter, not dispenser.\n\nOnion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nTo access (3,4), player can be at (3,3) and face up.\n\n(3,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), at (4,3) face up.\n\n(4,3) empty.\n\nFrom Bob at (4,1), to reach (3,3), he can move left to (3,1), but if occupied, or go around.\n\nSince Alice is at (3,1), he can move right to (5,1), then up? Cannot, so to (6,1), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (5,3) or (7,3), but (7,3) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(5,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen to (5,4)? (5,4) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nTo get to (3,3), from (4,1) move left to (3,1) if free, but Alice is there.\n\nAt turn 21, Alice is at (3,1), Bob at (4,1).\n\nTurn 22:\n\n- Alice: at (3,1) facing D, holding nothing. She can stay or move.\n\n- Bob: at (4,1) facing R, holding nothing. He can move to get onion.\n\nBut to get to onion dispenser, he needs to go to (3,3) or (4,3).\n\nFirst, he can move right to (5,1) or left to (3,1) but occupied.\n\nMove right to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), he can move up to (5,2) not possible, so move right to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then from (6,2) he can move left to (5,2) not possible, or right to (7,2) but (7,2) serving counter, not walkable, or up to (6,3).\n\n(6,2) to (6,3) is possible, (6,3) empty.\n\nThen from (6,3), he can move left to (5,3), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nLong way.\n\nFrom (4,1), he can move up if possible, but not, so he must go to x where y=2 is walkable, like x=1 or x=6.\n\nx=1, (1,2) is walkable.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1), she can move.\n\nFor the pot, we need one more onion for (3,0).\n\nInstead of Bob going far, Alice can get another onion, but she is at (3,1) empty.\n\nOr Bob can use the other pot at (4,0).\n\nBut let's focus on filling one pot.\n\nSince the pot has two onions, and we need one more, Bob is at (4,1), he can add to (4,0) or to (3,0).\n\nFirst, for Bob to add to (4,0).\n\nHe is at (4,1), facing R, so not facing down.\n\nHe needs to face down.\n\nTurn 22:\n\n- Bob: D (change orientation to down) → now facing D\n\n- Alice: she can go to get an onion or something.\n\nBut let's have Bob add to (4,0).\n\nTurn 22:\n\n- Bob: D (face down) → facing D\n\n- Alice: she can move to (4,1) or something, but let's say she moves right to (4,1)? (4,1) is where Bob is, but Bob is moving to face down, not position change, so (4,1) occupied.\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can move up to (3,2)? (3,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nMove left to (2,1), or down not possible.\n\nMove left to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1) she can go up to (2,2) not possible, or left to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nAlice can go to onion dispenser to get another onion for the pot.\n\nBut she is at (3,1), she can go to (3,4).\n\nFirst, she needs to go to (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,1), move up to (3,2) not possible, so she must go to (2,1) or (4,1) but occupied.\n\nTurn 22 actions:\n\n- Bob: D (face down) at (4,1)\n\n- Alice: since (4,1) occupied, she can move left to (2,1) or stay.\n\nMove left to (2,1), orientation L.\n\nThen at (2,1), she can move up to (2,2) not possible, or down not, so move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1) but she came from there.\n\n (1,1) is empty.\n\nShe can go to (1,1), then to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut this is taking too many turns.\n\nPerhaps we can have both players contribute to filling the pot.\n\nPot at (3,0) has two onions.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), she can face down and add an onion if she has one, but she doesn't.\n\nBob at (4,1), he can add to (4,0) but that's a different pot.\n\nThen we have two pots with some onions.\n\nBut cooking only starts when three are added.\n\nSo better to fill one pot first.\n\nBob can go to (3,3) to get onion.\n\nFrom (4,1), move left to (3,1), but Alice is there.\n\nSo Alice should move away.\n\nTurn 22:\n\n- Alice: move left to (2,1) → position (2,1), orientation L\n\n- Bob: D (face down) at (4,1) → facing D\n\nThen turn 23:\n\n- Bob: I (interact with (4,0) to add onion? But he is holding nothing, so he cannot add. He needs to have an onion to add.\n\nBob is empty-handed, so he cannot add to pot.\n\nHe needs to get an onion first.\n\nAt turn 23, Bob can do nothing or move.\n\nLet's reset the plan.\n\nStart from turn 18.\n\nTurn 18:\n- Alice: I (pick up onion from (1,0)) → holds onion\n- Bob: D (face down) → faces D\n\nTurn 19:\n- Alice: move right to (2,1) → at (2,1), facing R\n- Bob: I (add onion to (3,0)) → pot has 1 onion, Bob empty\n\nTurn 20:\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) but (3,1) has Bob, so cannot. So she can move up to (2,2) not possible, or down not, or left back, so she must stay or change orientation, but she wants to go right.\n\nSince she can't move right, she can do something else, like change orientation, but not useful.\n\nShe can move up to (2,2) not possible, so only move left to (1,1) or stay.\n\nMove left to (1,1), orientation L.\n\nThen from (1,1) she can move up to (1,2), which is empty.\n\nTurn 20:\n- Alice: move up to (1,2) → at (1,2), facing U\n- Bob: move right to (4,1) → at (4,1), orientation R (since move right)\n\nNow Alice at (1,2), holding onion, facing U.\n\nBob at (4,1), empty, facing R.\n\nPot at (3,0) has 1 onion.\n\nAlice can go to (3,0) to add her onion.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,0), she can move right to (2,2) not possible, or down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1).\n\n(2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo path: (1,2) to (1,1) down, then to (2,1) right, then to (3,1) right.\n\nFrom (1,2), move down to (1,1) at turn 20, but at turn 20 she moved to (1,2), so at turn 21 she can move down to (1,1).\n\nThen turn 22 move right to (2,1).\n\nTurn 23 move right to (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face down and add onion.\n\nBob at (4,1), he can go to get another onion for the pot.\n\nFrom (4,1), to (4,4), he can move up, but (4,2) counter, so go to (3,1) but occupied, or to (5,1), etc.\n\nTo (3,3), he can move left to (3,1) but occupied, so move to (5,1), then to (5,2) not, to (6,1), to (6,2), to (6,3), to (5,3), to (4,3), to (4,4) but to get onion, he needs to be at (4,3) and face up.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nSince Alice is adding her onion at turn 24 or so, the pot will have 2 onions, then Bob can add one more.\n\nBut Bob needs to have an onion.\n\nAt turn 20, Bob is at (4,1), empty.\n\nHe can go to (4,4) to get onion.\n\nTurn 20: Bob moved to (4,1)\n\nTurn 21: Bob move right to (5,1) → at (5,1), facing R\n\nTurn 22: Bob move right to (6,1) → at (6,1), facing R\n\nTurn 23: Bob move up to (6,2) → at (6,2), facing U  (since move up)\n\nTurn 24: Bob move up to (6,3) → at (6,3), facing U\n\nTurn 25: Bob move left to (5,3) → at (5,3), facing L\n\nTurn 26: Bob move left to (4,3) → at (4,3), facing L\n\nTurn 27: Bob change orientation to up (U) to face (4,4) dispenser\n\nTurn 28: Bob I to get onion from dispenser\n\nThen he has onion.\n\nThen he needs to go back to pot.\n\nBut it's turn 28, and the pot at (3,0) has only 1 onion so far, Alice is on her way to add.\n\nAlice at turn 20: at (1,2), facing U\n\nTurn 21: move down to (1,1) → at (1,1), facing D\n\nTurn 22: move right to (2,1) → at (2,1), facing R\n\nTurn 23: move right to (3,1) → at (3,1), facing R  (assuming no one there)\n\nBob is away, so (3,1) empty.\n\nTurn 24: Alice D (face down) → facing D\n\nTurn 25: Alice I (add onion to (3,0)) → pot now has 2 onions, Alice empty\n\nPot at (3,0) has 2 onions at turn 25.\n\nBob is at (4,3) at turn 26, then gets onion at turn 28.\n\nThen he can go to (3,0) to add.\n\nFrom (4,3), to (3,0), he can move down to (4,2) not possible, so move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2) not, so to (3,1), then face down to add.\n\nTurn 28: Bob at (4,3) facing U after getting onion, so he has onion.\n\nTurn 29: move left to (3,3) → at (3,3), facing L\n\nTurn 30: move down to (3,2) not possible, (3,2) counter, so he can move down to (3,1) if possible, but from (3,3) to (3,2) not walkable, so he must move to (3,1) directly? No, (3,2) is between, not walkable.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down to (3,2) not possible, so move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3), or down not.\n\n(2,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (2,2) not walkable, to (2,1), etc.\n\nLong way.\n\nFrom (3,3) move down to (3,2) not possible, so he can only move to (2,3) or (4,3) or (3,4) not walkable.\n\nSo to (2,3), then down to (2,2) not, so to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nTurn 29: Bob move left to (3,3) from (4,3)\n\nAt turn 28 he is at (4,3), turn 29 move left to (3,3)\n\nTurn 30: move down not possible, so move left to (2,3) → at (2,3), facing L\n\nTurn 31: move down to (2,2) not possible, so move down to (2,1) → at (2,1), facing D\n\nTurn 32: move right to (3,1) → at (3,1), facing R\n\nTurn 33: D (face down) → facing D\n\nTurn 34: I (add onion to (3,0)) → now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so at turn 39, soup is ready.\n\nThen need to serve with plate.\n\nBut this is inefficient.\n\nBetter to use the onion on the counter earlier, but it's gone.\n\nOr have Bob add to the pot directly when he has onion.\n\nAt turn 19, after Bob adds first onion, he can go to get another onion immediately.\n\nBut Alice is coming with one.\n\nSince there is another pot at (4,0), and Bob is at (3,1) after adding, he can move to (4,1) and add to (4,0) if he has onion, but he doesn't.\n\nHe needs to get onion.\n\nBut let's think of a better plan.\n\nAlice can add her onion to (4,0) instead.\n\nFrom her position.\n\nAt turn 18, after Alice picks up onion, she is at (1,1) holding onion.\n\nInstead of going to (3,0), she can go to (4,0).\n\nFrom (1,1) to (4,0).\n\nShe can move right to (2,1), then to (3,1) but occupied, so at turn 19 she moves to (2,1), then turn 20 if Bob moves, she can go to (3,1), then to (4,1), then face down to (4,0).\n\nBob at turn 19 adds onion to (3,0), then at turn 20 moves to (4,1), then at turn 21 faces down or adds if he can.\n\nBut he is empty.\n\nTurn 18:\n- Alice: I, hold onion\n- Bob: D, face down\n\nTurn 19:\n- Alice: move right to (2,1) , facing R\n- Bob: I, add to (3,0), pot 1 onion, empty\n\nTurn 20:\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) , but Bob there, so cannot. Bob can move right to (4,1) first.\n\nTurn 20:\n- Bob: move right to (4,1) , facing R\n- Alice: since (3,1) free now, move right to (3,1) , facing R\n\nTurn 21:\n- Alice: at (3,1) facing R, holding onion. She can D to face down, then I to add to (3,0), but (3,0) has 1 onion, she adds, so 2 onions.\n- Bob: at (4,1) facing R, empty. He can D to face down to (4,0), then since empty, he can go get onion.\n\nAfter Alice adds, pot at (3,0) has 2 onions.\n\nBob at (4,1), he can add to (4,0) if he has onion, but he doesn't.\n\nHe can go to get onion for (3,0).\n\nBut (4,0) is empty, he can add there later.\n\nFor turn 21:\n- Alice: D (face down) at (3,1)\n- Bob: D (face down) at (4,1) to face (4,0)\n\nTurn 22:\n- Alice: I (add onion to (3,0)) → pot has 2 onions, Alice empty\n- Bob: since facing down, he can interact with (4,0), but he is empty-handed, so if he does I, nothing happens, or he can move to get onion.\n\nAfter Alice adds, we need one more onion.\n\nBob can go to get it.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nAlice is empty at (3,1), she can go to get an onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,4).\n\nShe can move up to (3,2) not possible, so move to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) has Bob.\n\nTurn 22:\n- Alice: after adding, at (3,1) facing D, empty\n- Bob: at (4,1) facing D, empty\n\nAlice can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1) occupied, or up not, so move left to (2,1)\n\nThen to (1,1), etc to get to onion.\n\nBut let's accept that it takes time and plan the cooking.\n\nAssume that at some point they add the third onion.\n\nFor example, at turn 22, pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen at turn 23, Alice or Bob gets an onion and adds at turn 25 or so.\n\nCooking starts at turn 25, ready at turn 30.\n\nThen serve.\n\nBut we also need a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nPlayer needs to go there, get plate, then go to pot, pick up soup, then to serving counter.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nSo after soup is cooked, player with empty hand can interact with pot to pick up soup if holding plate? No.\n\nTo serve soup: player must be holding a plate with soup.\n\nTo get soup from pot: player interacts with pot while holding a clean plate, and pot has cooked soup, then player gets the soup in plate.\n\nThen take it to serving counter.\n\nFirst, need to get a clean plate from dispenser.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nPlayer empty-handed can interact to get plate.\n\nThen go to pot, interact to get soup.\n\nThen go to serving counter at (7,2), interact to deliver.\n\nNow, for the planning, we need to decide who does what.\n\nSince H is not specified, we can plan for the next few turns to start the process.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should aim to complete one soup quickly.\n\nAt turn 18, both players can work on filling the pot.\n\nBob has an onion, can add to pot.\n\nAlice can add the onion from counter.\n\nThen need one more onion.\n\nThe nearest onion source is the dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4).\n\nBob is closer to it after adding his onion.\n\nAfter Bob adds at (3,0), he is at (3,1), then he can go to (3,3) to get onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,3), but (3,2) counter, so he must go to (2,1) or (4,1), then to (2,2) not, so to (2,3), then to (3,3).\n\nTurn 19: Bob adds onion to (3,0), at (3,1) empty.\n\nTurn 20: Bob move left to (2,1) , facing L (assuming move left)\n\n(2,1) empty.\n\nTurn 21: Bob move up to (2,2) not possible, so move up to (2,3)? From (2,1) to (2,2) not walkable, so he can move to (1,1) or (3,1), or (2,0) not.\n\nMove to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nPerhaps for this level, the players need to coordinate better.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can add her onion to the other pot at (4,0).\n\nThen we have two pots with one onion each, then add more.\n\nBut still need to fill one.\n\nLet's define the actions for the first few turns to add the first two onions quickly.\n\nTurn 18:\n- Alice: I (pick up onion from (1,0)) - now holds onion\n- Bob: D (face down) - faces D\n\nTurn 19:\n- Alice: move right to (2,1) - at (2,1), facing R\n- Bob: I (add onion to (3,0)) - pot (3,0) has 1 onion, Bob empty\n\nTurn 20:\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) - but Bob there, so Bob moves first.\n\nTurn 20:\n- Bob: move right to (4,1) - at (4,1), facing R\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) - at (3,1), facing R\n\nTurn 21:\n- Alice: D (face down) - facing D\n- Bob: D (face down) at (4,1) - facing D\n\nTurn 22:\n- Alice: I (add onion to (3,0)) - pot (3,0) has 2 onions, Alice empty\n- Bob: at (4,1) facing D, empty. He can I to interact with (4,0), but no item, so nothing. Or he can move to get onion.\n\nNow pot (3,0) has 2 onions.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) empty.\n\nShe can go to get an onion.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move to (4,1) but occupied, or left to (2,1), or up not.\n\nMove left to (2,1).\n\nThen to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), then to (3,3).\n\nAt (3,3), face up to (3,4) dispenser to get onion.\n\nThen back to (3,1) to add.\n\nMany turns.\n\nBob at (4,1), he can go to (4,3) to get onion from (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,1) move up not, so move to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut let's say Alice goes for the onion.\n\nTurn 22: Alice adds, at (3,1) empty\n\nTurn 23: Alice move left to (2,1) - at (2,1), facing L\n\nTurn 24: Alice move left to (1,1) - at (1,1), facing L\n\nTurn 25: Alice move up to (1,2) - at (1,2), facing U\n\nTurn 26: Alice move up to (1,3) - at (1,3), facing U\n\nTurn 27: Alice move right to (2,3) - at (2,3), facing R\n\nTurn 28: Alice move right to (3,3) - at (3,3), facing R\n\nTurn 29: Alice U (face up) - facing U\n\nTurn 30: Alice I (get onion from (3,4)) - holds onion\n\nThen turn 31: move down to (3,2) not possible, so move down to (3,1) - from (3,3) to (3,2) not, so move to (4,3) or (2,3), then to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,3) move down to (3,2) not, so move left to (2,3), then down to (2,2) not, to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nTurn 31: Alice move left to (2,3) - at (2,3), facing L\n\nTurn 32: move down to (2,1) - at (2,1), facing D (since move down, but (2,2) not walkable, so directly to (2,1)? No, from (2,3) to (2,2) not possible, so she can move to (2,2) not, so move to (1,3) or (3,3), or down to (2,2) not, so only horizontal or to (2,4) not walkable.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can move down to (2,2) not possible, so move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3), or up to (2,4) not walkable.\n\nSo to (3,3), then to (3,2) not, so she must go to (3,1) via (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (2,3) move left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nLong.\n\nFrom (3,3) she can move down to (3,2) not, so move to (4,3), then down to (4,2) not, to (4,1), then to (3,1).\n\nTurn 31: from (3,3) move right to (4,3) - at (4,3), facing R\n\nTurn 32: move down to (4,2) not possible, so move down to (4,1) - at (4,1), facing D\n\nTurn 33: move left to (3,1) - at (3,1), facing L\n\nTurn 34: D (face down) - facing D\n\nTurn 35: I (add onion to (3,0)) - now 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 35.\n\nReady at turn 40.\n\nThen serve.\n\nBut this is too slow, and we haven't planned for Bob.\n\nBob can help with getting the plate or something.\n\nBut for now, to answer the query, we need to provide a sequence for Alice for H turns.\n\nPerhaps H is short, like 5 or 10 turns, so we can plan the next few actions to progress.\n\nSince the pot is empty now, at turn 18, we can start adding.\n\nFor example, at turn 18, Alice picks up onion from counter.\n\nBob faces down to pot.\n\nTurn 19, Alice moves towards pot, Bob adds onion.\n\nTurn 20, Bob moves away, Alice moves to position.\n\n Etc.\n\nBut let's provide a sequence for Alice for say 5 turns.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTurn 18: I (interact with (1,0) to pick up onion)\n\nThen she holds onion.\n\nTurn 19: move right to (2,1)  (since (2,1) empty)\n\nTurn 20: if possible, move right to (3,1), but if Bob there, she may not, so she can move up to (2,2) not possible, so she can move left back or stay, but better to move up to (1,2) if possible.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can only move left to (1,1) or if (3,1) free.\n\nBut in general, for planning, we can assume Bob moves away.\n\nBut since we only control Alice, we can plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will cooperate.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can plan for both to optimize.\n\nTo simplify, plan for Alice only for H=5 turns.\n\nTurn 18: I (pick up onion)\n\nTurn 19: R (move right to (2,1))\n\nTurn 20: R (move right to (3,1), if possible, or if not, she can't, so perhaps U to move up to (2,2) not possible, so she must L or S.\n\nBut to make progress, assume she can move to (3,1) when free.\n\nFor the sequence, we can put the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 18 to 22.\n\nTurn 18: Alice I\n\nTurn 19: Alice R ( to (2,1) )\n\nTurn 20: Alice U (move up to (1,2)? From (2,1), move up to (2,2) not possible, so she can only move to (1,1) or (3,1) or stay.\n\nMove to (1,1) with L.\n\nThen from (1,1) she can move U to (1,2).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: I\n\nTurn 19: R ( to (2,1) )\n\nTurn 20: L (move left to (1,1) )\n\nTurn 21: U (move up to (1,2) )\n\nTurn 22: U (move up to (1,3) )\n\nThen she is closer to onion dispenser.\n\nBut she is holding an onion, so she needs to add it first.\n\nShe is holding onion since turn 18, so at turn 20 she is at (2,1) holding onion, if she moves to (1,1), she still has it, then to (1,2), etc, but she should add it to a pot.\n\nSo better to go to (4,0) or something.\n\nI think I need to accept the initial plan and provide a sequence.\n\nLet's provide the first few actions for Alice.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTurn 18: I  (pick up onion from (1,0))\n\nTurn 19: R  (move right to (2,1))\n\nTurn 20: R  (intend to move to (3,1), but if blocked, she doesn't move, but in plan we put the action)\n\nTurn 21: D  (face down to interact with pot, but she may not be at (3,1))\n\nNot consistent.\n\nPerhaps for this state, Alice can go to the other pot.\n\nPot at (4,0).\n\nFrom (1,1), she can go to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), to (3,3), to (4,3), then down to (4,1), then face down to (4,0).\n\nBut with onion, she can add at (4,0).\n\nBut at (4,3), she can face down to (4,2) not pot, so she needs to be at (4,1) to face (4,0).\n\nSo from (4,3) to (4,2) not possible, to (4,1), then face down.\n\nBut many turns.\n\nI think for the sake of answering, I'll provide a sequence based on the initial interaction.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nAt turn 18, Alice should pick up the onion.\n\nThen move towards the pot.\n\nFor Alice actions:\n\nTurn 18: I\n\nTurn 19: R  ( to (2,1) )\n\nTurn 20: U  ( to (1,2) ) -- from (2,1), she can move up to (1,2)? From (2,1) to (1,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are left (1,1), right (3,1), up (2,2) not walkable, down (2,0) not walkable, so from (2,1) she can only move to (1,1) or (3,1) if available.\n\nSo she must move to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nAssume she moves to (1,1) if (3,1) occupied.\n\nTurn 20: L ( to (1,1) )\n\nTurn 21: U ( to (1,2) )\n\nTurn 22: U ( to (1,3) )\n\nThen at (1,3), she can move right to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut she is holding onion, so she should not go up.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can only go to (1,1) or (3,1), so if she goes to (1,1), then she can move down to (1,0) not, so she is stuck with the onion.\n\nThe only way is to go to (3,1) when free.\n\nFor the plan, we can include Bob's actions to coordinate.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 18:\n- Alice: I\n- Bob: D (face down)\n\nTurn 19:\n- Alice: R ( to (2,1) )\n- Bob: I (add to (3,0))\n\nTurn 20:\n- Alice: R ( to (3,1) , since Bob moved or not, but at turn 19 Bob is at (3,1), so at turn 20, if Bob moves, Alice can move to (3,1).\n\nTurn 20:\n- Bob: R (move to (4,1) )\n- Alice: R ( to (3,1) )\n\nTurn 21:\n- Alice: D (face down)\n- Bob: D (face down at (4,1))\n\nTurn 22:\n- Alice: I (add to (3,0)) -- now 2 onions\n- Bob: since empty, he can S or move.\n\nThen for Alice, she can go to get another onion or let Bob do it.\n\nFor the answer, since we need to box the sequence for Alice, and optionally Bob, but the format is for Alice.\n\nThe answer format is for Alice only, I think.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\"\n\nSo for Alice, for the next H turns.\n\nSay H=5.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 18: I\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nTurn 20: R  (intend to move to (3,1))\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nTurn 22: I\n\nThen she adds her onion to the pot.\n\nIf she can move to (3,1) at turn 20, then at turn 21 she faces down, turn 22 adds.\n\nSo the sequence is reasonable.\n\nThen for Bob, he can be assumed to move away.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should coordinate to fill a pot with 3 onions as quickly as possible, allowing the soup to cook for 5 turns (starting when the third onion is added) before serving. The recipe requires 3 onions, yields a reward of 20, and has a cooking time of 5 turns. Since all pots are empty at turn 18, the nearest pot (3,0) should be prioritized. Alice is positioned to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (1,0), and Bob is positioned to add his held onion to the pot at (3,0). After adding the first two onions, Bob should fetch the third onion from an onion dispenser while Alice prepares to serve by fetching a plate after the soup is cooked.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Turn 18:** Alice picks up the onion from (1,0) since she is adjacent and facing it. Bob changes orientation to face down (toward the pot at (3,0)) to prepare for adding his onion.\n- **Turn 19:** Alice moves toward the pot at (3,0) by going to (2,1). Bob adds his onion to the pot at (3,0), which now contains 1 onion.\n- **Turn 20:** Alice moves to (3,1) (now unoccupied after Bob moves). Bob moves to (4,1) to clear space and prepare for fetching another onion.\n- **Turn 21:** Alice changes orientation to face down (toward the pot). Bob changes orientation to face down (toward (4,0)) but cannot interact yet as he is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 22:** Alice adds her onion to the pot at (3,0), which now has 2 onions. Bob begins moving toward an onion dispenser to fetch the third onion.\n- **Subsequent Turns:** Bob fetches the third onion and adds it to start cooking. Alice can then fetch a plate from (0,2) while the soup cooks. After 5 turns of cooking, the soup is served at the serving counter (7,2) for a reward.\n\n### Action Sequence for Alice (for Turns 18 to 22, H=5)\nAlice's actions focus on picking up the onion, moving to the pot, and adding her onion to contribute to the soup. Bob's suggested actions are included for coordination but are optional in the output.\n\n- **Turn 18:** Alice interacts to pick up the onion from (1,0) (she is empty-handed, facing down, and adjacent).\n- **Turn 19:** Alice moves right to (2,1) to approach the pot.\n- **Turn 20:** Alice moves right to (3,1) (Bob moves away to (4,1), making (3,1) available).\n- **Turn 21:** Alice changes orientation to down (faces the pot at (3,0)) using the 'D' action (move down is invalid, so it acts as orientation change).\n- **Turn 22:** Alice interacts to add her onion to the pot at (3,0), which now has 2 onions.\n\nAfter this sequence, the pot has 2 onions, and Bob can fetch the third onion to start cooking. Alice is then free to fetch a plate from (0,2) in preparation for serving.\n\n### Suggested Actions for Bob (for Coordination)\n- Turn 18: D (change orientation to down to face (3,0)).\n- Turn 19: I (add onion to pot at (3,0)).\n- Turn 20: R (move right to (4,1) to clear space for Alice).\n- Turn 21: D (change orientation to down to face (4,0)).\n- Turn 22: Begin moving to onion dispenser (e.g., at (3,4)) to fetch the third onion.\n\n### Why This Plan Maximizes Reward\n- **Efficiency:** Alice and Bob add the first two onions by turn 22, minimizing idle time. The third onion can be added by Bob around turn 26-28 (depending on pathing), starting the cook at turn 28. The soup is ready by turn 33, and serving can occur by turn 35.\n- **Reward:** One soup delivers a reward of 20. With this coordination, a second soup could be started if time permits, but the focus is on completing the first quickly.\n- **Constraints Honored:** Players avoid collisions (e.g., Bob moves away on turn 20), and actions respect facing and adjacency rules for interactions.\n\nThis sequence leverages Alice's position to use the available onion on the counter and positions both players for efficient soup completion. For a longer horizon, Alice should fetch a plate after turn 22 while the soup cooks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: I \\\\\nTurn 19: R \\\\\nTurn 20: R \\\\\nTurn 21: D \\\\\nTurn 22: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 23. We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next H turns to maximize the total reward. Since the problem doesn't specify H, we'll plan for a reasonable horizon that allows us to complete a recipe.\n\nGiven the recipe: Recipe 1 requires 3 onions and cooks in 5 turns, with a reward of 20.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (1,1), facing Down, holding one onion.\n- Bob: at (6,1), facing Right, holding nothing.\n\nKitchen counters: only (5,2) has an onion.\n\nPots: both empty.\n\nWe have two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). We also have onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), and a plate dispenser at (0,2). The serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nGoal: We want to make and serve a soup of 3 onions. Since we need 3 onions, and Alice already has one, we need two more onions.\n\nPossible plan:\n1. Alice can put her onion into one of the pots. But note: the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Alice is at (1,1). She needs to go to a pot.\n\n2. Bob can get another onion from a dispenser or from the kitchen counter.\n\nHowever, note the kitchen counter at (5,2) has an onion. So Bob can pick that up.\n\nAlternatively, we can get onions from the dispensers.\n\nBut let's see the positions:\n\nAlice (1,1) -> to reach a pot, say (3,0): \n  One path: (1,1) -> (2,1) [right] -> (3,1) [right] -> (3,0) [down? but note: from (3,1) to (3,0) is down? Actually, the grid: (x,y) with U increasing y? But the move: D decreases y? The rules say: D (x, y-1). So (1,1) to (1,0) would be down? But (1,0) is a kitchen counter? We can't walk on non-empty tiles. Let's see the kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), etc. So (1,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty? Actually, kitchen counters are non-empty? But note: the tile type is kitchen counter, and it can be used for storage. But the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And a kitchen counter is a tile type that is non-empty? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The rule says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then other types. So only empty tiles are walkable? Actually, the rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles include dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters? \n\nBut note: the rule also says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo, the non-empty tiles (like dispensers, pots, etc.) are not walkable. So we must be on an adjacent empty tile to interact.\n\nTherefore, the grid has:\n- Walkable: only empty tiles and ...? Actually, the rule doesn't explicitly say, but from the context, only empty tiles are walkable? Because the other tiles are non-empty and we cannot walk on them.\n\nSo, for Alice to get to the pot at (3,0), she must go through empty tiles. The pot is at (3,0), so she must stand next to it. The adjacent tiles to (3,0) are: (3,1) [above], (2,0) [left], (4,0) [right]. But (2,0) and (4,0) are kitchen counters? Let's see: kitchen counters include (2,0) and (4,0) is not in the list? Wait, kitchen counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), ...]. So (4,0) is a pot? and (3,0) is a pot? Then the adjacent tiles: \n  - (3,0) has neighbors: (3,1) [above: empty? we don't know], (2,0) [left: kitchen counter -> non-walkable], (4,0) [right: pot? non-walkable]. So the only adjacent empty tile is (3,1). Similarly, (4,0) has adjacent: (4,1) and (3,0) and (5,0). (5,0) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So (4,0) can only be accessed from (4,1) or (3,0) but (3,0) is non-walkable? So each pot must be accessed from the tile above? (y=1).\n\nTherefore, to interact with (3,0), Alice must be at (3,1) and facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0): from (4,1) facing down.\n\nNow, the grid: we don't have a map of all empty tiles, but we can infer from the positions and the fact that we can move.\n\nAlice at (1,1). We need to get to (3,1) to use the pot at (3,0). How?\n\nPath for Alice: \n  (1,1) -> (2,1) [right] -> (3,1) [right]. Then she can face down and interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\nBut what about the tile (2,1)? Is it empty? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we know the non-empty ones. The non-empty tiles are the ones listed as dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters. Also, note that players block movement? But Bob is at (6,1) so that's empty? Actually, the rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So at (2,1) and (3,1) we assume they are empty and walkable unless there's a player.\n\nCurrently, Bob is at (6,1). So (2,1) and (3,1) should be empty.\n\nSo Alice: \n  Turn 23: move right to (2,1) -> action R\n  Turn 24: move right to (3,1) -> action R\n  Turn 25: change orientation to down? Or can she interact without changing? Currently she is at (3,1) and facing? After moving right to (3,1), she would be facing right? Then she needs to face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). So:\n  Turn 25: change orientation to down (action D? but D is move down? Wait, the actions: Move (L/R/U/D) and Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) are separate? Actually, the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. The description says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> Wait, that seems confusing.\n\nActually, the description says:\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nBut note: the change orientation action is also labeled by L/R/U/D? That might be ambiguous. However, the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. How do we differentiate between move and change orientation?\n\nRe-reading: \n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): ... \n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): ... \n- **Interact (I)**\n- **Stay (S)**\"\n\nBut then the action set is given as {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how do we specify change orientation? \n\nThis is ambiguous. But note: the move action changes both position and orientation. The change orientation action does not change position. So if the player is at a position and we issue a move action, they move and change orientation. If we issue a change orientation action, they don't move. But the action set is the same labels? \n\nLooking at the answer format: we only output U, D, L, R, I, S. So how to express change orientation?\n\nThe description for change orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> but that doesn't make sense. Actually, it says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> That must be a typo. It should be that change orientation doesn't move, regardless. But the condition is for move? \n\nI think the intention is: \n- When you use a direction (L/R/U/D) as a move, you move in that direction and your orientation becomes that direction.\n- When you use a direction (L/R/U/D) as a change orientation, you just change your orientation to that direction without moving. But how is that represented in the action set? The action set only has U, D, L, R, I, S. \n\nThe problem states: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can: ...\" and then lists the actions. But then the answer format uses the same symbols. \n\nI think we must assume that if a move in that direction is possible, then U/D/L/R means move. But if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then the player cannot move and the action might be interpreted as change orientation? But that's not stated.\n\nAlternatively, the action set might be interpreted as:\n- If the player uses U/D/L/R and the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then they move and change orientation to that direction.\n- If the adjacent tile is not empty, then they don't move and only change orientation to that direction.\n\nThis is a common mechanic. So we'll assume that.\n\nTherefore, for Alice at (3,1) to interact with the pot at (3,0) (which is below her), she must face down. So she can do:\n  Action: D -> but (3,0) is below her? The tile below (3,1) is (3,0) -> which is a pot -> non-empty. So if she does D, she cannot move (because (3,0) is non-empty) but she will change her orientation to down.\n\nSo at turn 25: Alice does D -> changes orientation to down, and does not move.\n\nThen turn 26: she can interact (I) to put the onion into the pot.\n\nBut note: the pot is at (3,0). She is at (3,1) and facing down -> adjacent and facing the pot -> can interact.\n\nNow, what about Bob? Bob is at (6,1) and holding nothing. We need more onions. There is an onion on the kitchen counter at (5,2). Bob can pick that up. How?\n\nBob at (6,1): \n  To get to (5,2): \n    He is at (6,1). (5,2) is left and up? \n    But (5,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he must stand adjacent to it. The adjacent empty tiles? \n    (5,2) has neighbors: (5,1) [below], (5,3) [above], (4,2) [left], (6,2) [right]. \n    (4,2) is a kitchen counter? The list: kitchen counters include (5,2) and (4,2) is in the list? Yes, (4,2) is a kitchen counter. So (4,2) is non-walkable. Similarly, (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The list: kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (6,2) is not in the list -> is it empty? We don't know, but we assume it's empty? Also, (5,1) and (5,3) might be empty.\n\nBob is at (6,1). He can go up to (6,2) [if empty] and then left to (5,2) is not possible because (5,2) is non-walkable. So he must stand next to (5,2) on an empty tile and face it.\n\nAdjacent empty tiles to (5,2): \n  (5,1): below? \n  (5,3): above? \n  (4,2): left -> non-walkable (kitchen counter)\n  (6,2): right -> we don't know? But the kitchen counter list doesn't include (6,2), and dispensers: no dispenser at (6,2), pots: no, serving counter: (7,2). So (6,2) should be empty? \n\nBut Bob at (6,1) can go:\n  Turn 23: U to (6,2) -> now he is at (6,2), facing up? \n  Then, to interact with (5,2) which is left of him? He is at (6,2) and (5,2) is to his left. So he must face left. \n  Turn 24: change orientation to left: but how? If he does L (left), then he tries to move left to (5,2) -> but (5,2) is non-empty, so he doesn't move and changes orientation to left. \n  Then turn 25: interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter at (5,2) has an onion. So Bob can pick it up.\n\nThen Bob has an onion. He can then go to the pot and put it.\n\nBut which pot? The pot at (3,0) is being used by Alice? Or we can use the same pot? The pot can take 3 ingredients. Currently, Alice is putting one onion at turn 26. Then we need two more.\n\nBob can put his onion in the same pot? But the pot is at (3,0). Bob is at (6,2). How to get to (3,1)? \n\nAlternatively, we have another pot at (4,0). But we want to make one soup with 3 onions. So we should put all in one pot.\n\nSo Bob should go to (3,1) or (4,1) to put the onion in the same pot? \n\nBut the pot at (3,0) is the one we started. So Bob should go to (3,1) and face down to put the onion.\n\nPath for Bob from (6,2) to (3,1):\n  (6,2) -> (5,2) is blocked? But (5,2) is non-walkable. So he must go down to (6,1) then left to (5,1) -> but (5,1) is empty? Then to (4,1) -> (3,1). \n\nBut note: (3,1) might be occupied by Alice? At turn 26, Alice is at (3,1) (after putting the onion, she remains at (3,1)). Then Bob cannot go to (3,1) because Alice is there.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (4,1) and put the onion in the pot at (4,0)? But then we have two pots each with one onion? That would require two more onions each. We don't want that.\n\nSo we need to coordinate: after Alice puts her onion, she should move away so Bob can put his.\n\nSo plan:\n\nAlice:\n  t23: R to (2,1) [facing right? because she moves right]\n  t24: R to (3,1) [facing right?]\n  t25: D -> since (3,0) is non-empty, she doesn't move, but changes orientation to down.\n  t26: I -> put onion in pot at (3,0). Now the pot has 1 onion. Alice is now holding nothing.\n\nThen Alice should move away from (3,1) so Bob can use it. Where can she go? \n  She can go left to (2,1) -> action L. But then Bob needs to come to (3,1).\n\nBut Bob is on his way. Let's plan Bob:\n\nBob at (6,1) at t23:\n  t23: U -> to (6,2) [facing up]\n  t24: L -> tries to move left to (5,2) but cannot because (5,2) is non-empty? So he doesn't move, but changes orientation to left (towards (5,2)).\n  t25: I -> picks up the onion from (5,2). Now Bob is holding an onion.\n\nThen Bob needs to go to (3,1). But Alice is at (3,1) until t26. So at t26, Alice is at (3,1) and then she moves? \n\nBob at (6,2) at t25 (after interacting). Then at t26, he can move down to (6,1) -> action D. Then at t27, move left to (5,1) -> action L. Then at t28, move left to (4,1) -> action L. Then at t29, move left to (3,1) -> action L. But at t29, if Alice is still at (3,1), then Bob cannot move there. So we need Alice to leave (3,1) by t28 or t29.\n\nAlice at t26: after interacting, she is at (3,1) holding nothing. Then at t27, she can move left to (2,1) -> action L. Then (3,1) is free at t27? Actually, when she moves at t27, she leaves (3,1) at the end of the turn. So at t27, (3,1) is free? \n\nSo Bob:\n  t26: D to (6,1) [facing down?]\n  t27: L to (5,1) [facing left]\n  t28: L to (4,1) [facing left]\n  t29: L to (3,1) [facing left] -> but now he is at (3,1) and facing left. He needs to face down to interact with the pot? \n  t30: D -> change orientation to down (since (3,0) is non-empty, he doesn't move, just faces down).\n  t31: I -> put onion in pot. Now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nWe still need one more onion. Who gets it? Alice is free at (2,1) holding nothing. She can get an onion from the dispenser or from the kitchen counter? But the kitchen counter at (5,2) is now empty? Bob took the onion. So she must go to an onion dispenser.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). \n\nAlice at (2,1) at t27. How to get to (3,4)? \n  (2,1) -> (2,2): but (2,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, in the list -> non-walkable. \n  So she must go up? \n  The grid: we need to know the empty tiles. Alternatively, she can go right to (3,1) but Bob is there at t29? \n\nWe need a path. Let's try:\n  (2,1) -> down to (2,0)? But (2,0) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n  Left to (1,1): which is empty? \n  Then up? (1,1) to (1,2): is (1,2) empty? Not in the non-empty list? So empty. Then (1,2) to (1,3)? Then to (1,4)? But (1,4) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n\nAlternatively, from (1,1) to (0,1) is kitchen counter? (0,1) is in the list -> non-walkable. \n\nSo the only way up? (1,1) to (1,2) -> then (1,2) to (1,3) -> then (1,3) to (1,4) is non-walkable? So she must go right at (1,2) to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is non-walkable (kitchen counter). \n\nThis is a problem. We need to know the layout. But the kitchen counters are at (2,2) and (3,2) and (4,2) and (5,2). So the row y=2 is blocked from x=2 to x=5? \n\nThen how to get to y=3 and above? \n\nThere must be a gap. The kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3) and (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), ... so at y=3,4. \n\nBut at y=2, we have kitchen counters from x=2 to x=5. So the only walkable tiles at y=2 are at x=0,1,6,7? But (0,2) is a plate dispenser -> non-walkable. (7,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. (1,2) and (6,2) might be empty? \n\nWe know (6,2) is empty because Bob was there. And (1,2): not in any non-empty list -> empty.\n\nSo Alice at (2,1) -> she can go up? But (2,1) to (2,2) is non-walkable. So she must go left to (1,1) -> then up to (1,2) [which is empty]. \n\nSo:\n  t27: Alice at (2,1) -> L to (1,1) [facing left]\n  t28: U to (1,2) [facing up]\n\nThen from (1,2) she can go right? to (2,2) is non-walkable. So she must go up? (1,2) to (1,3) -> but (1,3) is not in any non-empty list? So empty. Then t29: U to (1,3). Then t30: U to (1,4)? But (1,4) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must go right? But (2,3) is empty? Then (3,3) -> but we don't know. \n\nAlternatively, from (1,2) she can go up to (1,3) -> then right to (2,3) -> then right to (3,3) -> then down to (3,2) is non-walkable? (3,2) is kitchen counter. So she cannot go down at (3,3) to (3,2). \n\nWe need to get to (3,4) or (4,4). The dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). \n\nHow about going to (4,4) from the right? But Bob is at (3,1) at t29. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the kitchen counter at (5,2) to store an onion? But it's empty now. We don't have an onion there. \n\nBut we need an onion. So Alice must go to an onion dispenser. The dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). \n\nHow to get to (3,4)? \n  From (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) is non-walkable? So she must stand adjacent. (3,4) has adjacent: (3,3) [below], (3,5) [above]? but we don't know about (3,5). And (2,4) [left] and (4,4) [right]. (2,4) is kitchen counter? Yes, in the list. (4,4) is onion dispenser. So the only adjacent empty tile is (3,3). \n\nSimilarly, (4,4) can be accessed from (4,3).\n\nSo Alice must go to (3,3) to get an onion from (3,4) by facing up? (3,4) is at y=4, so from (3,3) (y=3) she would face up? \n\nBut (3,3) is at (3,3). How to get there from (1,3)? \n  (1,3) -> (2,3) [right] -> (3,3) [right]. \n\nSo:\n  Alice at (1,2) at t28.\n  t29: U to (1,3)\n  t30: R to (2,3)\n  t31: R to (3,3) [facing right?]\n  Then she needs to face up to interact with the dispenser at (3,4). \n  t32: U -> since (3,4) is non-empty, she doesn't move, changes orientation to up.\n  t33: I -> grabs an onion.\n\nThen she needs to go back to the pot at (3,0). So she must go down to (3,2) but (3,2) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must go around? \n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked. So she must go to (4,3) -> (4,2) is non-walkable? (4,2) is kitchen counter. So the path is blocked? \n\nThis is a problem. The kitchen counters at (2,2) to (5,2) block the entire row y=2 from x=2 to 5. So she cannot go down from y=3 to y=1 at x=3. \n\nAlternative path: from (3,3) to (4,3) -> then (5,3) -> then down to (5,2) is non-walkable. Then to (5,1) -> but that's below (5,2). \n\nBut (5,3): is it empty? Then (5,3) to (5,2) is non-walkable. Then to (5,1): from (5,3) to (5,2) is blocked. \n\nSo the only way down is at the sides? For example, at x=1 and x=6. \n\nSo Alice at (3,3) must go left to (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> then down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1) -> then to (3,1). \n\nThat is long.\n\nBut we are at turn 33 and she just got the onion. Then:\n  t34: L to (2,3)\n  t35: L to (1,3)\n  t36: D to (1,2)  [facing down?]\n  t37: D to (1,1)  [facing down]\n  t38: R to (2,1)  [facing right]\n  t39: R to (3,1)  [facing right]\n  t40: D -> change to down\n  t41: I -> put onion in pot.\n\nBut the pot at (3,0) already has 2 onions? Bob put one at t31. Now at t41, we put the third. Then the pot starts cooking at turn 41. It takes 5 turns to cook, so ready at turn 46.\n\nThen we need to serve it. We need a plate. Bob is free? Or Alice? \n\nBut this is too long and we are only planning for a few turns? We need to reconsider.\n\nAlternative: use the kitchen counter to store the onion that Bob picked up? Then Alice can pick it up later? \n\nBut Bob is at (3,1) at t29, holding an onion. Instead of putting it in the pot, he could place it on a kitchen counter near the pot? For example, at (2,2) is a kitchen counter? But (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1) and (3,2) and (2,3). But (2,1) is where Alice is at t27? \n\nBut note: we have kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). They are non-walkable, but we can interact with them if adjacent.\n\nSo Bob at (3,1) holding an onion at t29. He can place the onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2)? How? \n  He is at (3,1), facing down? (from t30: he faced down to put in pot). But to interact with (3,2) which is above him? So he must face up. \n  t30: U -> change orientation to up (since (3,2) is non-empty, he doesn't move).\n  t31: I -> places the onion on (3,2)? But the kitchen counter must be empty? Currently, we don't know the state of (3,2). The initial state: only (5,2) had an onion. So (3,2) is empty. So he can place it.\n\nThen Bob is free. And the onion is on (3,2). Then Alice, after she gets the onion from the dispenser, doesn't need to go all the way to the pot? She can pick up this onion? But she is holding one already? She can only carry one.\n\nBut we need two onions? We have one in the pot (from Alice), and one on the kitchen counter (from Bob). We need one more.\n\nSo after Alice gets an onion from the dispenser, she can put it in the pot? Then we have two in the pot and one on the counter. Then someone must put the counter onion into the pot.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nBetter: after the first two onions are in the pot, the third onion can be brought by either player.\n\nBut given the time, we might want to have Bob get the third onion? \n\nAfter Bob puts the onion from the kitchen counter into the pot at t31 (or places it on (3,2) at t31), then he is free. He can go to an onion dispenser to get another onion.\n\nBob at (3,1) after t31 (he placed the onion on (3,2))? He is at (3,1) holding nothing. Then he can go to (3,2) is non-walkable, so he must go to (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> then to (6,3)? Then to (5,3)? Then to (4,3)? Then to (4,4) to get an onion.\n\nThis is also long.\n\nAlternatively, we can have both players work on getting the third onion. But it's complicated.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to use the second pot? But that would make two soups with less than 3 onions? Not rewarding.\n\nWe must complete one pot with 3 onions.\n\nRevised plan:\n\n1. Alice puts her onion in the pot at (3,0) as soon as possible.\n2. Bob picks up the onion from (5,2) and brings it to the same pot.\n3. Alice, after putting her onion, goes to get another onion from a dispenser and brings it back.\n\nBut the path to the dispenser and back is long. \n\nWe can have Bob, after putting his onion, go to get the third onion.\n\nAfter Bob puts the onion in the pot at turn 31, the pot has 2 onions. Then Bob can go to get the third onion.\n\nBob at (3,1) at turn 31 (after interacting to put the onion). He is holding nothing.\n\nThen he can go to an onion dispenser, say (4,4):\n\n  (3,1) -> (4,1) [R] -> (5,1) [R] -> (6,1) [R] -> (6,2) [U] -> (6,3) [U] -> (6,4) [U] -> then at (6,4), he can interact with (5,4) or (4,4)? (5,4) is kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (5,4) -> non-walkable. (4,4) is onion dispenser. From (6,4) he must face left to (5,4) or (4,4) but (5,4) is kitchen counter, (4,4) is dispenser. So to interact with (4,4), he must be at (4,4) adjacent empty tile. The adjacent to (4,4): (4,3) [below], (3,4) [left], (5,4) [right] -> kitchen counter, non-walkable. So only (4,3) and (3,4) are possible. (3,4) is also a dispenser. \n\nSo from (6,4) to (4,3): \n  (6,4) -> (5,4) is blocked -> cannot. \n  (6,4) -> (6,3) [D] -> (6,2) [D] -> (6,1) [D] -> (5,1) [L] -> (4,1) [L] -> (4,2) is non-walkable -> cannot. \n\nSo he must go to (4,3) from (4,1) by going up? \n  From (4,1) -> (4,2) is blocked. \n  So he must go to (3,1) -> (3,2) blocked -> cannot.\n\nThis is not possible. The only access to the onion dispensers is from the north? (3,3) for (3,4) and (4,3) for (4,4).\n\nSo Bob must go to (3,3) or (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,2) blocked. So he must go to (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). \n\nThat is long.\n\nGiven the time constraints, and since we are only planning for Alice, perhaps we focus on Alice's actions and assume Bob will help.\n\nBut the task: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both.\n\nLet's try to coordinate better.\n\nAt turn 23:\n  Alice: R to (2,1)\n  Bob: U to (6,2)\n\nturn 24:\n  Alice: R to (3,1)\n  Bob: L (change orientation to left) because cannot move left to (5,2)\n\nturn 25:\n  Alice: D (change to down)\n  Bob: I (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nturn 26:\n  Alice: I (put onion in pot at (3,0)) -> pot has 1 onion, Alice now empty.\n  Bob: D to (6,1)  [facing down]\n\nturn 27:\n  Alice: L to (2,1)  [free up (3,1)]\n  Bob: L to (5,1)  [facing left]\n\nturn 28:\n  Alice: U to (1,2)  [from (2,1) to (1,1)? Wait, she is at (2,1) -> L to (1,1) at turn 27. Then at turn 28, U to (1,2)\n  Bob: L to (4,1)  [facing left]\n\nturn 29:\n  Alice: U to (1,3)\n  Bob: L to (3,1)  [facing left]\n\nturn 30:\n  Alice: R to (2,3)\n  Bob: D (change to down) for the pot.\n\nturn 31:\n  Alice: R to (3,3)\n  Bob: I (put onion in pot) -> pot has 2 onions.\n\nturn 32:\n  Alice: U (change to up to face dispenser)\n  Bob: S or move away.\n\nturn 33:\n  Alice: I (grab onion from (3,4))\n\nNow Alice has an onion. She needs to go to the pot. But the pot has 2 onions and needs one more.\n\nAlice at (3,3) with onion. She must go to (3,1) to put it in the pot. But the path is blocked at (3,2). So she must go around:\n  turn 34: L to (2,3)\n  turn 35: L to (1,3)\n  turn 36: D to (1,2)\n  turn 37: D to (1,1)\n  turn 38: R to (2,1)\n  turn 39: R to (3,1)\n  turn 40: D (change to down)\n  turn 41: I (put onion) -> now the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts.\n\nCooking time: 5 turns, so ready at turn 46.\n\nThen we need to serve. We need a plate. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). \n\nAfter turn 41, Alice is at (3,1) empty. She can go to get a plate.\n\nBut (0,2) is far. Alternatively, Bob can get the plate.\n\nBob at turn 31: after putting the onion, he is at (3,1) empty. Then turn 32: he can move away. For example, to (4,1) -> then to (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (7,2) is serving counter, not walkable. Then he can go to (0,2) to get a plate? \n\nBut (0,2) is a dispenser. He must stand adjacent. (0,2) has adjacent: (0,1) [below] -> kitchen counter, non-walkable; (0,3) [above] -> kitchen counter, non-walkable; (-1,2) out of bound; (1,2) [right] -> empty. \n\nSo he can stand at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nPath from (3,1) to (1,2):\n  (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) (up). \n  turns: \n    turn 32: L to (2,1)\n    turn 33: L to (1,1)\n    turn 34: U to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 35: change orientation to left ( action L -> since (0,2) is non-empty, he changes to left)\n turn 36: I -> grab a plate.\n\nThen he needs to deliver the soup when ready. The soup will be ready at turn 46. He can wait or move to the pot area.\n\nAt turn 36, he has a plate. The soup won't be ready until turn 46. He can go to (3,1) to be ready.\n\nPath from (1,2) to (3,1):\n  (1,2) -> (1,1) [D] -> (2,1) [R] -> (3,1) [R]. \n  turn 37: D to (1,1)\n  turn 38: R to (2,1)\n  turn 39: R to (3,1)\n\nThen at turn 40-45: wait. Turn 46: face down and interact to serve the soup? But he is holding a plate, and the pot has cooked soup. Interact will serve the soup.\n\nBut at turn 41 the cooking starts, so at turn 46 it's ready.\n\nSo at turn 46: Bob at (3,1) facing right? after moving right, he faces right. He needs to face down.\n  turn 46: D (change to down) \n  turn 47: I -> serve the soup.\n\nThis works, but it's long and we are only planning for a few turns? The task says \"over next several turns\", so we can plan until the soup is served, but that's 24 turns from turn 23 to 47. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify H, we can choose H=10 or something. But to maximize reward, we should at least get one soup.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps we output the first few turns for Alice and assume Bob will do his part.\n\nBut the answer format only has actions for Alice? The task: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The answer format only has turns with actions, and it doesn't specify for which player. But the context is Alice.\n\nRe-reading: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice\"\n\nSo we only plan for Alice. Bob is controlled by someone else? But the task says \"optionally Bob\", so we might not control Bob.\n\nThe task: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But in the answer format, it seems only actions for Alice are output.\n\nLet me read the answer format: \n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nIt doesn't mention player. But the task is for Alice.\n\nSo we only output Alice's actions.\n\nFor Alice, we need to plan her actions for the next H turns.\n\nSince we don't control Bob, we must assume he will act rationally. But we know his action history and state.\n\nGiven that, let's plan for Alice only for the next 10 turns (H=10).\n\nAlice's immediate actions:\n\n1. She should put the onion she is holding into a pot. So head to (3,0) pot.\n   - Turn 23: R (move to (2,1))\n   - Turn 24: R (move to (3,1))\n   - Turn 25: D (change orientation to down, since move down is blocked)\n   - Turn 26: I (interact to put onion in pot)\n\n2. Then she is free. She can help get another onion. The closest onion source is the dispenser, but it's far. Or the kitchen counter at (5,2) has an onion, but Bob might be getting it.\n\n   At turn 26, Bob might be getting the onion from (5,2). So Alice should go to an onion dispenser to get a new onion.\n\n   So from (3,1) at turn 26, she can start moving towards (3,4) or (4,4). \n\n   But the path is long and blocked at y=2. She must go via (1,2) and (1,3) etc.\n\n   Turn 27: L to (2,1)\n   Turn 28: L to (1,1)\n   Turn 29: U to (1,2)\n   Turn 30: U to (1,3)\n   Turn 31: R to (2,3)\n   Turn 32: R to (3,3)\n   Turn 33: U (change orientation to up)\n   Turn 34: I (grab onion from dispenser)\n\nThen she has an onion. She can try to put it in the pot, but it's far.\n\nSince we are only planning 10 turns, we can output until turn 23+9 = turn 32.\n\nSo for Alice, turns 23 to 32:\n\nTurn 23: R\nTurn 24: R\nTurn 25: D\nTurn 26: I\nTurn 27: L\nTurn 28: L\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\n\nBut at turn 32, she arrives at (3,3). Then she needs to face up and interact, but that's beyond turn 32.\n\nAlternatively, after putting the onion, she can wait or do something else. But getting the next onion is the best.\n\nSo we'll output this.\n\nBut let's verify the path is valid.\n\n- (1,1) -R-> (2,1): empty? yes.\n- (2,1) -R-> (3,1): empty? yes, and not blocked by Bob initially.\n- At (3,1), facing right. Then D: cannot move down (since (3,0) non-empty), so changes orientation to down.\n- I: interacts with pot below -> puts onion.\n- Then L to (2,1): empty.\n- L to (1,1): empty.\n- U to (1,2): empty.\n- U to (1,3): empty.\n- R to (2,3): empty.\n- R to (3,3): empty.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for 10 turns, we have until turn 32.\n\nBut the turn numbering: t1=23, so actions from turn 23 to turn 32 are 10 actions.\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: R\nTurn 24: R\nTurn 25: D\nTurn 26: I\nTurn 27: L\nTurn 28: L\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\n}\n\nThis is for Alice.\n\nNote: This is just the beginning. In the full game, she would then face up and grab an onion, etc.\n\nBut for the given horizon, this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should prioritize contributing her held onion to a pot to start the cooking process, then proceed to gather additional ingredients. Given the current state (Alice at (1,1) holding an onion, Bob at (6,1) holding nothing, and an onion available on the kitchen counter at (5,2)), the immediate goal is for Alice to deposit her onion into the nearest pot at (3,0). Afterward, she should navigate toward an onion dispenser to gather another onion for the recipe, as the pot requires three onions. This plan leverages Alice's current position and item, while allowing Bob to potentially retrieve the onion from (5,2) and assist with the recipe.\n\n### Optimized Action Sequence for Alice (Turns 23–32):\n- **Turn 23 (R)**: Move right to (2,1). This advances Alice toward the pot at (3,0) and positions her for further movement.\n- **Turn 24 (R)**: Move right to (3,1). Alice is now adjacent to the pot at (3,0) (below her).\n- **Turn 25 (D)**: Change orientation to down (since moving down is blocked by the non-empty pot tile). Alice now faces the pot.\n- **Turn 26 (I)**: Interact to place the onion into the pot at (3,0). The pot now contains one onion, and Alice is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 27 (L)**: Move left to (2,1). This frees (3,1) for Bob to use and starts Alice's path toward an onion dispenser.\n- **Turn 28 (L)**: Move left to (1,1). Continues the path northward around the blocked kitchen counters at y=2 (x=2–5).\n- **Turn 29 (U)**: Move up to (1,2). Alice navigates toward the onion dispensers at (3,4)/(4,4).\n- **Turn 30 (U)**: Move up to (1,3). Progresses to a viable route for accessing the dispensers.\n- **Turn 31 (R)**: Move right to (2,3). Positions Alice closer to the dispensers.\n- **Turn 32 (R)**: Move right to (3,3). Alice is now below the onion dispenser at (3,4) and can interact next turn.\n\n### Coordination and Rationale:\n- **Bob's Expected Role**: With Bob at (6,1) holding nothing, he can retrieve the onion from (5,2) (e.g., via moves: Up to (6,2), face left, interact). He can then deposit it into the pot at (3,0) after Alice vacates (3,1) at turn 27. This collaboration ensures the pot receives two onions quickly.\n- **Efficiency**: By turn 32, Alice has deposited her onion and is positioned to gather another from a dispenser. The pot will have at least one onion (from Alice), and likely two (if Bob delivers the onion from (5,2)). Alice can then return to the pot with a third onion (after turn 32) to complete the recipe.\n- **Reward Maximization**: Completing a 3-onion soup (reward: 20) is prioritized. Cooking starts automatically when the pot reaches three onions and takes 5 turns. Subsequent actions (beyond turn 32) would involve Alice facing up, grabbing an onion, returning to the pot, and coordinating with Bob for serving.\n\nThis sequence optimizes Alice's movements for ingredient contribution and gathering, minimizes idle time, and anticipates Bob's collaboration based on his position and the available onion at (5,2).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: R\nTurn 24: R\nTurn 25: D\nTurn 26: I\nTurn 27: L\nTurn 28: L\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 26. The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns to maximize the reward from delivering soup.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n**Alice:**\n- Position: (4,1)\n- Orientation: R (right, so facing (5,1))\n- Holding: one onion\n- Action History: D, I, R, R, R (most recent is the last R)\n\n**Bob:**\n- Position: (5,3)\n- Orientation: L (left, so facing (4,3))\n- Holding: nothing\n- Action History: I, R, U, U, L (most recent is L)\n\n**Environment:**\n- Kitchen Counters: many, but specifically (5,2) has an onion.\n- Pots: both at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty.\n- Onion Dispensers: at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: at (0,2)\n- Serving Counter: at (7,2)\n\n**Recipe:**\n- Only Recipe 1: 3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nSince there are no tomatoes, we can only make onion soup.\n\n**Objective:**\nWe need to deliver as many onion soups as possible. The soup requires 3 onions in a pot, which then cooks for 5 turns and then must be served with a plate.\n\n**Current Holdings:**\n- Alice has one onion. She is at (4,1) facing right (towards (5,1)). \n- Bob has nothing and is at (5,3) facing left (towards (4,3)).\n\n**Obstacles and Opportunities:**\n- There is an onion on the kitchen counter at (5,2). This can be picked up by a player who is empty-handed and adjacent to (5,2) and facing it.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nWe have two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). Both are empty. We need to put 3 onions in one of the pots.\n\nAlice is already holding an onion. She can put it into a pot. But note that she is at (4,1). The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) is directly below her. However, she is facing right (east). To interact with the pot at (4,0), she needs to be adjacent and facing it. Since (4,0) is below (4,1), she must face down to interact.\n\nSo Alice's immediate next action should be to turn down (D) to face the pot at (4,0). Then she can interact to put the onion in.\n\nBut note: the pot at (4,0) is empty. After putting one onion, it will have one onion. Then we need two more.\n\nBob is at (5,3) and is empty. He can pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (5,2). Note that (5,2) is adjacent to (5,3) (since (5,3) is above (5,2)). Bob is currently facing left (west). To interact with (5,2) which is below him, he needs to face down. So Bob should turn down and then interact to pick up the onion.\n\nAlternatively, Bob could also go to an onion dispenser to get an onion, but there is an onion already on the counter at (5,2) which is closer.\n\nSo plan for the next few turns:\n\n**Turn 26 (Alice's next action):**\n- Alice: She is at (4,1) facing right. To interact with the pot below her (4,0), she must face down. So she should change orientation to D (down). Alternatively, she could move down to (4,0) and then interact? But note: the pot at (4,0) is a non-empty tile? Actually, the pot is a tile that is not walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the pot is a tile that is not empty? Actually, the pot is a tile that is interactable but not walkable. So Alice cannot move down to (4,0) because it's a pot. Therefore, she must be adjacent and facing it. She is at (4,1) which is adjacent to (4,0) (above it). So she can interact if she faces down.\n\nBut note: the action for changing orientation is the same as moving? Actually, the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. The problem states: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But that seems confusing. Actually, the description says:\n\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nWait, that might be a misreading. The problem says:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut note: the second bullet says \"Change Orientation\" but the action is still labeled by U/D/L/R? And it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" — that seems odd. Actually, I think it means: if you use the move action, you move and change orientation. If you use the change orientation action (which is also by pressing U/D/L/R but in a different mode? Or is there a separate way to change orientation without moving? The problem doesn't specify a separate action for orientation change. \n\nLooking back: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nAnd for changing orientation: it says \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" — This is ambiguous.\n\nBut then in the action set, we have only {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So I think the intended meaning is:\n\n- When a player chooses an action U, D, L, R: \n  - If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable, then the player moves to that tile and changes orientation to that direction.\n  - Otherwise (if the adjacent tile is not empty or not walkable), then the player only changes orientation to that direction (without moving).\n\nSo in effect, the same action (say D) can either be a move (if the tile below is empty and walkable) or just an orientation change (if the tile below is not walkable).\n\nTherefore, for Alice at (4,1) facing right, if she does D (down):\n- The tile below (4,0) is a pot, which is non-empty (because it's a pot tile) and not walkable. So she will not move, but she will change her orientation to down.\n\nThen, after that, she can interact (I) to put her onion into the pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (5,3) facing left. He can do D (down) to change orientation to down (without moving because (5,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable). Then he can interact (I) to pick up the onion from (5,2).\n\nSo let's plan:\n\n**Turn 26:**\n- Alice: D (down) to change orientation to down (without moving, because (4,0) is a pot and not walkable).\n- Bob: We can suggest Bob to do D (down) to change orientation to down (so that he faces (5,2)).\n\nBut note: we are only required to output actions for Alice. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can focus on Alice and assume Bob will act reasonably? However, to maximize coordination, we might want to specify Bob's actions too. But the answer format is for Alice. \n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice\", so it seems we only output Alice's actions. But then how do we coordinate with Bob? We must assume that Bob is controlled by another agent and we cannot control him? Or we can? The problem says \"optionally Bob\", meaning we might output Bob's actions too? But the answer format only shows one sequence of actions per turn? Actually, the answer format is:\n\n```\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n```\n\nAnd each action is for Alice? The problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So I think we are to output only Alice's actions, but we can assume that Bob is also acting in a coordinated manner? Or we can output both? The answer format doesn't specify. Since it says \"for Alice\", I will output only Alice's actions and assume Bob is acting optimally as well.\n\nBut to be safe, let's assume we only control Alice. Then we must plan for Alice and hope that Bob is smart.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says \"optionally Bob\", meaning we can output actions for both? But the answer format doesn't show how. So I think we are to output only Alice's actions.\n\nTherefore, I will plan for Alice and assume Bob will do his part.\n\nSo for turn 26:\n- Alice: D (to face down towards the pot at (4,0))\n\nThen on turn 27:\n- Alice: I (to put the onion into the pot at (4,0))\n\nNow, after Alice puts the onion, the pot at (4,0) has 1 onion. Alice is now empty-handed.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob at (5,3) facing left. We hope he will turn down and pick up the onion at (5,2). But we cannot control him. So let's think what Alice should do next.\n\nAfter Alice puts the onion, she is at (4,1) facing down and holding nothing. She can then go to get another onion.\n\nWhere to get onions? There are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). Also, there is an onion on the counter at (5,2) but Bob might take it.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate? But we don't have a soup ready yet.\n\nWe need two more onions for the pot at (4,0). So Alice should get another onion.\n\nBut note: Bob is also going for the onion at (5,2). If Bob takes it, then that onion is gone. Then Alice can go to an onion dispenser.\n\nSo let's assume Bob takes the onion at (5,2) on his turn 26 and 27:\n\nBob's turn 26: D (to face down) -> then turn 27: I (to pick up onion from (5,2)). Then Bob is holding an onion.\n\nThen Bob can take that onion to the pot at (4,0). He is at (5,3). After picking up, he is at (5,3) facing down. To go to the pot at (4,0), he needs to move: left to (4,3) and then down to (4,2) and then down to (4,1) and then interact with (4,0) by facing down? But (4,0) is adjacent to (4,1). So he can go to (4,1) and then face down and interact.\n\nAlternatively, he might go to the other pot? But the other pot is at (3,0). \n\nBut let's focus on Alice.\n\nAfter Alice puts the onion (turn 27), she is empty at (4,1) facing down.\n\nShe can then go to an onion dispenser to get another onion. The nearest is at (3,4) or (4,4). (4,4) is two steps down: from (4,1) to (4,2) (if empty) then (4,3) then (4,4). But (4,2) is a kitchen counter? We have kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (4,2) is a kitchen counter. But it's non-empty? The non-empty kitchen counter is only (5,2) which has an onion. So (4,2) is empty? We are told: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter: Kitchen Counter on (5,2): contains a onion\". So other kitchen counters are empty and can be walked on? Actually, kitchen counters are tiles that are walkable? The rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and they are listed as tile types. The movement rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? Or are kitchen counters always non-walkable? The rules don't specify. But typically in Overcooked, counters are walkable. And the rule says \"non-empty tiles\" meaning if there is an item on it? \n\nThe problem states: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty tiles\" are defined as tiles that have an item or are a dispenser/pot/etc? Actually, the tile types are: empty, dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter. And only empty tiles are described as walkable. The others are non-empty? \n\nLooking back: \n- **Empty Tile:** Walkable space.\n- **Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter:** These are non-empty tiles? And the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So no, players cannot walk on any of these. They can only walk on empty tiles.\n\nTherefore, (4,2) is a kitchen counter tile, so it is non-empty and not walkable. Similarly, (5,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, also not walkable.\n\nSo the grid has walkable tiles only where there are no dispensers, pots, serving counters, or kitchen counters? And the grid is 8x5? We have positions from (0,0) to (7,4). \n\nBut we don't have a full grid map. However, we know the positions of non-empty tiles. So to move from (4,1) to (4,4) (onion dispenser), we must go around because (4,2) and (4,3) are not walkable? Actually, (4,3) is not listed as any non-empty tile? The non-empty tiles are only the ones listed.\n\nThe tile types are given for specific coordinates. So:\n\n- Kitchen Counters: at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pot: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nSo any tile not in these lists is an empty tile? For example, (4,1) is not listed, so it's empty? (4,3) is not listed, so it's empty? (5,3) is not listed, so it's empty? (4,1) is empty? But Alice is standing on it? Yes, because it's empty and walkable.\n\nSo (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so not walkable. Therefore, to go from (4,1) to (4,4), we cannot go straight down because (4,2) is blocked. We must go around.\n\nPossible path: from (4,1) go right to (5,1) (if empty) — (5,1) is not listed, so empty? Then from (5,1) we can go down to (5,2)? But (5,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable. So we cannot go down to (5,2). Alternatively, from (5,1) go down to (5,0)? (5,0) is a kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo we must go left? From (4,1) go left to (3,1) (if empty) — (3,1) not listed, so empty. Then from (3,1) go down to (3,2)? (3,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable. Then go left? (2,1) — not listed, so empty. Then down? (2,2) is kitchen counter, blocked.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,1) go up? (4,1) is at y=1, up would be (4,2) — blocked. So we must go horizontally to a column that has a gap.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nWe can see that the kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — so row y=2 is blocked from x=2 to x=5. So we must go around row y=1 or y=3.\n\nTo get to the onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), we can go via the top or bottom? But the bottom is row y=0 which is blocked by kitchen counters? Actually, row y=0 is all kitchen counters? (0,0) to (7,0) are all kitchen counters? No: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) — so (3,0) and (4,0) are pots? But pots are also non-walkable. So row y=0 is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, row y=4: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) are kitchen counters, and (3,4), (4,4) are onion dispensers. So row y=4 is blocked.\n\nRow y=3: (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters, so (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) are empty? Bob is at (5,3) at the start.\n\nRow y=1: (0,1) and (7,1) are kitchen counters, so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are empty.\n\nRow y=2: entirely blocked by kitchen counters from x=2 to 5? And (0,2) is a plate dispenser? And (7,2) is serving counter. So row y=2: (0,2) and (7,2) are non-empty, and (1,2), (6,2) are not listed? We don't have information about (1,2) and (6,2). The kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (1,2) and (6,2) are not listed as any non-empty tile? Then they are empty.\n\nTherefore, the walkable paths are:\n\n- Row y=1: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 (since (0,1) and (7,1) are non-empty)\n- Row y=3: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 (since (0,3) and (7,3) are non-empty)\n- Row y=2: only x=1 and x=6? Because (0,2) is plate dispenser, (1,2) is not listed -> so empty? (2,2) is kitchen counter, (3,2) kitchen, (4,2) kitchen, (5,2) kitchen, (6,2) empty? (7,2) serving.\n\nBut (1,2) is not listed in any non-empty, so it's empty. Similarly, (6,2) is empty.\n\nSo we can move through (1,2) and (6,2) in row y=2.\n\nTherefore, to go from (4,1) to (3,4) (onion dispenser):\n\n- Option 1: \n  - (4,1) -> (3,1) [left]\n  - (3,1) -> (3,0) is blocked (pot), so cannot go down. Then go to (2,1) [left]\n  - (2,1) -> (1,1) [left]\n  - (1,1) -> (1,2) [up] (because (1,2) is empty and walkable)\n  - (1,2) -> (1,3) [up] (if (1,3) is empty? It's not listed, so empty)\n  - (1,3) -> (1,4) [up] -> but (1,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (1,4) is listed as kitchen counter -> non-empty, not walkable. So cannot go to (1,4). This path fails.\n\n- Option 2: \n  - From (4,1) go right to (5,1) -> (5,1) is empty? Yes.\n  - Then (5,1) -> (6,1) [right] -> (6,1) is empty? Yes, because (7,1) is kitchen but (6,1) not listed -> empty.\n  - Then (6,1) -> (6,2) [up] -> (6,2) is empty? Yes.\n  - Then (6,2) -> (6,3) [up] -> (6,3) is empty? Yes.\n  - Then (6,3) -> (6,4) [up] -> (6,4) is kitchen counter? Yes -> non-empty, not walkable. So cannot.\n\n- Option 3: via row y=3.\n  - From (4,1) we need to get to row y=3. How? We cannot go down from (4,1) because (4,0) is blocked. So we must go left or right to a column that allows going up? But row y=2 is blocked in the middle. So we must go to x=1 or x=6 to cross at y=2.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  - (4,1) -> (3,1) [left]\n  - (3,1) -> (3,2) is blocked (kitchen counter). So cannot go up to y=2 at x=3.\n  - Similarly, at x=4: (4,1) to (4,2) blocked.\n  - At x=5: (5,1) to (5,2) blocked.\n  - So we must go to x=1 or x=6 to cross.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (1,1): \n  - (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\nThen from (1,1) to (1,2) [up] -> (1,2) is empty.\nThen from (1,2) to (1,3) [up] -> (1,3) is empty.\nThen from (1,3) to (2,3) [right] -> (2,3) is empty? Yes.\nThen (2,3) to (3,3) [right]\nThen (3,3) to (3,4) [up] -> (3,4) is an onion dispenser? Yes. But we cannot walk on it. We must be adjacent to interact.\n\nSo to get to (3,4), we can stand at (3,3) and face up. (3,3) is at y=3, (3,4) is at y=4, so adjacent vertically. So we can interact from (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, for (4,4), we can stand at (4,3) and face up.\n\nBut note: (3,3) and (4,3) are empty? Yes.\n\nSo the path for Alice from (4,1) to (3,4) is:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) [L]\n(3,1) -> (2,1) [L]\n(2,1) -> (1,1) [L]\n(1,1) -> (1,2) [U]\n(1,2) -> (1,3) [U]\n(1,3) -> (2,3) [R]\n(2,3) -> (3,3) [R]\nThen at (3,3), she can face up and interact to get an onion.\n\nThat's 7 moves. But we might not need to go that far if Bob can help.\n\nAlternatively, there is an onion at (5,2) on the counter. Bob might be taking it, but if not, Alice could pick it up? But Alice is at (4,1) and (5,2) is adjacent? (4,1) and (5,2) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side. So (4,1) is not adjacent to (5,2). The adjacent tiles to (5,2) are (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2). But (5,1) and (5,3) are empty? (5,3) has Bob. (4,2) is kitchen counter (non-walkable). (6,2) is empty.\n\nSo to pick up the onion at (5,2), Alice would have to be at one of the adjacent empty tiles and facing (5,2). The closest is (5,1) or (6,2) or (5,3) (but Bob is there).\n\nBut Bob is at (5,3) at turn 26. If he moves, then (5,3) might be free.\n\nBut let's assume we focus on the pot at (4,0) and try to get three onions in it.\n\nAfter Alice puts her onion (at turn 27), the pot has 1 onion. Then we need two more.\n\nBob is hopefully taking the onion from (5,2) and then bringing it to the pot. He is at (5,3). After picking up the onion, he can go to (5,1) then to (4,1) and put the onion in the pot.\n\nHow many turns for Bob?\n\nTurn 26: Bob does D (to face down) -> then turn 27: I (to pick up onion at (5,2)). Then he is holding an onion at (5,3) facing down.\n\nThen turn 28: Bob moves up? Or down? He is at (5,3) and wants to go to (4,1). He can go left to (4,3) (if empty) — (4,3) is empty? Yes. Then from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. So he must go down? But (5,2) is blocked. So from (4,3) he can go down? (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. So he must go to (4,1) via (3,3) and then down? That's long.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,3) he can go down? But (5,2) is blocked. Or up? (5,4) is kitchen counter. So he can only go left to (4,3) or right to (6,3) or down (but blocked). So (4,3) is the only option.\n\nThen from (4,3) to (3,3) [left]? Then (3,3) to (3,2) blocked. Then to (3,1) [down] — (3,1) is empty. Then (3,1) to (4,1) [right]? Then at (4,1) he can face down and interact with the pot.\n\nSo Bob's path: \n- Turn 26: D (face down)\n- Turn 27: I (pick up onion)\n- Turn 28: L (move left to (4,3)) -> because (4,3) is empty and adjacent? From (5,3) left to (4,3): yes, adjacent and empty? (4,3) is empty? Yes.\n- Turn 29: D (move down? But (4,2) is blocked, so he cannot move down. So he must go left to (3,3) first? From (4,3) to (3,3) is left. Then from (3,3) to (3,2) blocked. Then to (3,1) down. Then to (4,1) right.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 28: L to (4,3)\n- Turn 29: L to (3,3)\n- Turn 30: D to (3,2) -> blocked! (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So he cannot move down from (3,3) to (3,2). \n\nThis is a problem. Bob is stuck at (3,3) because he cannot go down. Similarly, he cannot go up because (3,4) is onion dispenser.\n\nSo from (4,3), he should go down? But (4,2) is blocked. Therefore, the only way is to go to (4,1) via (3,1) but without going down at x=3.\n\nFrom (4,3) he can go down only if there is a path. But there isn't. So he must go back to (5,3) and then down? But (5,2) is blocked. \n\nAlternatively, he can go to (4,4) or (3,4) but those are dispensers and not walkable.\n\nSo the only way for Bob to reach the pot is via (4,1) by going around the long way? But that will take many turns.\n\nGiven the complexity, it might be better for Alice to get the onion from (5,2) if possible.\n\nAt turn 26, Alice is at (4,1). She can move right to (5,1) (if empty) — (5,1) is empty. Then from (5,1), she can face down to interact with (5,2)? But (5,2) is below (5,1). And (5,2) is adjacent and she can face it. But note: the onion at (5,2) is on a kitchen counter, so she can pick it up if she is empty-handed? But at turn 27, after she moves to (5,1), she is still holding the onion she has? No, she hasn't put it yet.\n\nAt turn 26, Alice is holding an onion. She is at (4,1). If she goes to (5,1) (move right), then she is at (5,1) facing right? No, when she moves right, she changes orientation to right. But to interact with (5,2) which is below, she needs to face down. So she would need an extra turn to face down.\n\nBut she is holding an onion. She cannot pick up another item. She must put the onion she has first.\n\nTherefore, she must put the onion in the pot before doing anything else.\n\nSo back to the original plan:\n\nTurn 26: Alice does D (faces down) to be able to interact with the pot at (4,0).\nTurn 27: Alice does I (puts the onion in the pot at (4,0)). Now the pot has 1 onion. Alice is empty at (4,1) facing down.\n\nThen, she can try to get to the onion at (5,2) if it's still there.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (5,1) is one move right. Then at (5,1) she can face down and interact to pick up the onion from (5,2).\n\nBut will the onion be there? It depends on Bob.\n\nBob at turn 26: he is at (5,3) facing left. We hope he doesn't take the onion. Or perhaps he does. To be safe, let's assume he might take it, so Alice should go to an onion dispenser.\n\nBut going to (3,4) is far.\n\nAlternatively, there is another onion dispenser at (4,4). From (4,1) to (4,4) is not direct because (4,2) is blocked. So she can go to (4,3) and then face up to interact with (4,4).\n\nHow to get to (4,3)? \n- (4,1) -> (4,0) is blocked. -> (4,1) cannot go down.\n- So go right to (5,1) -> then down to (5,0) is blocked (kitchen counter). So cannot.\n- Go left to (3,1) -> then down to (3,0) blocked.\n- So must go to (3,1) or (5,1) and then up to y=3.\n\nFor example:\n- (4,1) -> (5,1) [R]\n- (5,1) -> (5,2) is blocked, so cannot go up. Then go to (6,1) [R]\n- (6,1) -> (6,2) [U] (empty)\n- (6,2) -> (6,3) [U]\n- (6,3) -> (6,4) is blocked (kitchen counter). Then go left to (5,3) [L] -> but Bob is at (5,3)? At turn 27, Bob might have moved.\n- Then from (6,3) to (5,3) [L] (if empty)\n- (5,3) -> (4,3) [L]\n- Then at (4,3), she can face up (U) and interact with (4,4) to get an onion.\n\nThis is 6 moves for Alice to get to (4,3) and then one more to face up and interact.\n\nThat's too many turns.\n\nFrom (4,1) -> (3,1) [L]\n(3,1) -> (3,2) blocked, so then (2,1) [L]\n(2,1) -> (1,1) [L]\n(1,1) -> (1,2) [U]\n(1,2) -> (1,3) [U]\n(1,3) -> (2,3) [R]\n(2,3) -> (3,3) [R]\n(3,3) -> (4,3) [R]\n Then at (4,3) face up to interact with (4,4) — 8 moves.\n\nEven longer.\n\nSo the fastest way is to try to pick up the onion at (5,2) if it's available.\n\nTherefore, after putting the onion (turn 27), Alice should:\n\nTurn 28: R (move right to (5,1)) and she will be facing right.\nTurn 29: D (face down) to face (5,2)\nTurn 30: I (interact to pick up the onion from (5,2), if it's still there)\n\nIf the onion is not there (because Bob took it), then she can go to an onion dispenser.\n\nBut to save turns, perhaps Alice and Bob can work on different pots.\n\nThere are two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). The one at (4,0) has one onion. We can put two more in it, or start on the other pot.\n\nBob might be bringing an onion to the other pot at (3,0).\n\nAt (3,0), which is adjacent to (3,1) (above) and (2,0) (left) — but (2,0) is kitchen counter, so only from (3,1).\n\nAlice is at (4,1) after turn 27. She can go left to (3,1) in one move.\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face down to interact with the pot at (3,0) (which is empty).\n\nThen she can put an onion there? But she is empty-handed. So she needs to get an onion first.\n\nSo it's better to get the onion first.\n\nGiven the time, let's plan for Alice for the next few turns with the assumption that we try to use the onion at (5,2) if available.\n\n**Proposed plan for Alice:**\n\n- Turn 26: D (face down to interact with pot at (4,0))\n- Turn 27: I (put onion in pot at (4,0); now pot has 1 onion, Alice empty)\n- Turn 28: R (move right to (5,1); now facing right)\n- Turn 29: D (face down to face the kitchen counter at (5,2))\n- Turn 30: I (interact to pick up the onion from (5,2), if it is there)\n\nIf the onion is there, she picks it up. Then she can put it in a pot.\n\nShe is at (5,1) holding an onion. The closest pot is at (4,0) or (3,0). (4,0) is at (4,0), adjacent to (4,1) and (3,0) is at (3,0) adjacent to (3,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), to (4,0): \n- First, move left to (4,1) [L]\n- Then at (4,1) face down (D) and interact (I) to put in the pot.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 31: L (move left to (4,1); now facing left)\n- Turn 32: D (face down)\n- Turn 33: I (put onion in pot at (4,0); now pot has 2 onions)\n\nThen she is empty again.\n\nThen she needs to get a third onion. She can go to an onion dispenser.\n\nBut it's turn 33, and the pot has 2 onions. One more onion and it will start cooking (5 turns).\n\nAlternatively, Bob might have put an onion in the pot already.\n\nTo deliver the soup, we also need a plate.\n\nSo while the soup is cooking, Alice or Bob can get a plate.\n\nBut let's see how many turns we are planning. We are at turn 26, and we are planning up to turn 33 (8 turns ahead). We can stop earlier.\n\nThe problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", so we can choose H.\n\nLet's output for the next 5 turns (up to turn 30) for now.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 26: D\nTurn 27: I\nTurn 28: R\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: I\n\nThis is a plan for 5 turns (t=26 to t=30).\n\nThen after that, she will have an onion if she picked it up, and then she can put it in the pot.\n\nBut note: at turn 30, if she picked up the onion, she is at (5,1) holding an onion. Then she can go to (4,1) and put it in the pot.\n\nSo for a few more turns:\n\nTurn 31: L (move to (4,1))\nTurn 32: D (face down)\nTurn 33: I (put in pot)\n\nThen the pot will have 2 or 3 onions? At turn 27 it had 1, and if no one else added, then at turn 33 it will have 2. We need one more.\n\nBut Bob might have added one.\n\nTo be safe, after turn 33, Alice can go to an onion dispenser to get a third onion.\n\nBut this is beyond our immediate plan.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify H, we can output for 5 turns.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: D\nTurn 27: I\nTurn 28: R\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: I\n}\n\nThis is for turns 26 to 30.\n\nNote: This plan assumes that the onion at (5,2) is still there at turn 30. If not, then Alice will do I but nothing happens (since the counter might be empty), and then she would need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, this is a reasonable plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivering soup recipes, Alice and Bob must coordinate to prepare and deliver onion soup, as it is the only available recipe. The plan focuses on efficiently adding onions to the pot at (4,0), leveraging the onion on the kitchen counter at (5,2) if available, and minimizing unnecessary movement. Alice will use her current onion to start filling the pot, then attempt to collect the onion from (5,2) for the pot. Bob, though not directly controlled, is expected to assist by collecting and adding onions to the pots based on his position and orientation.\n\n### Plan for Alice (Turns 26 to 30)\n- **Turn 26 (Alice)**: `D` (change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0) for interaction).\n- **Turn 27 (Alice)**: `I` (interact to place the onion into the pot at (4,0); the pot now has 1 onion).\n- **Turn 28 (Alice)**: `R` (move right to (5,1) to position for accessing the onion on (5,2); orientation changes to right).\n- **Turn 29 (Alice)**: `D` (change orientation to down to face the kitchen counter at (5,2)).\n- **Turn 30 (Alice)**: `I` (interact to pick up the onion from (5,2), if still available; Alice now holds an onion for the pot).\n\n### Reasoning\n- **Turn 26**: Alice faces down to prepare for interacting with the pot at (4,0), which is directly below her. This is necessary as the pot is non-walkable, and she must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n- **Turn 27**: Alice adds her onion to the pot at (4,0), starting the soup preparation. The pot now has 1 onion, and Alice is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 28**: Alice moves right to (5,1) to approach the kitchen counter at (5,2), which holds an onion. This move is efficient and avoids blocked tiles.\n- **Turn 29**: Alice faces down to prepare for interacting with the kitchen counter at (5,2).\n- **Turn 30**: Alice picks up the onion from (5,2) if Bob has not already taken it. This onion will be used to further fill a pot.\n\n### Coordination with Bob\n- Bob is at (5,3) facing left at turn 26. He can assist by:\n  - Turning down and picking up the onion at (5,2) on turns 26-27 if he acts optimally.\n  - If Bob takes the onion, he should deliver it to a pot (e.g., the pot at (4,0) or (3,0)) to avoid duplication of effort.\n- If Bob has already taken the onion by turn 30, Alice's `I` action on turn 30 will have no effect, and she should then proceed to an onion dispenser (e.g., (3,4) or (4,4)) for the next onion. However, the plan prioritizes the closest available resource.\n\n### Next Steps (Beyond Turn 30)\n- Alice, now holding an onion at (5,1), should:\n  - Move left to (4,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (4,0) (turns 31-33).\n  - Add the onion to the pot (turn 33), bringing it closer to 3 onions.\n- Once the pot has 3 onions, it will cook for 5 turns. During cooking, Alice or Bob should fetch a plate from (0,2) and deliver the soup to the serving counter at (7,2).\n- If the pot at (4,0) reaches 3 onions early, start filling the pot at (3,0) for a second soup.\n\nThis sequence maximizes efficiency by using available resources and positioning Alice for quick interactions, with an expected reward of 20 for the first delivered soup.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: D\nTurn 27: I\nTurn 28: R\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1, which requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a 20 reward. There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only use onions from the onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nCurrent game state at turn 29:\n\n- Alice is at (5,1), facing down, holding one onion.\n- Bob is at (3,3), facing up, holding nothing.\n- There's a kitchen counter at (5,2) that has an onion on it.\n- Pots are empty at (3,0) and (4,0).\n- Serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nAlice has an onion, and there's another onion on the kitchen counter at (5,2). Bob is empty-handed.\n\nAction history: Alice's recent actions are R, R, R, D, D. She moved right three times, then down twice. From where? Probably starting from (2,1) or something, but I don't need the exact start; it's to understand recent moves.\n\nBob's action history: U, L, L, L, U. So he moved up, left three times, then up. He ended at (3,3) facing up.\n\nNow, pots are empty, so we need to start cooking soup. Recipe requires 3 onions.\n\nAvailable onions: Alice has one, kitchen counter (5,2) has one, and we can get more from dispensers.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nBob is at (3,3), which is above the pots but near the onion dispensers? Let's see the grid layout.\n\nI should sketch the grid mentally.\n\nTile types:\n\n- Kitchen counters at various positions, but only (5,2) has an onion.\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nPlayers:\n- Alice: (5,1), facing down, holding onion\n- Bob: (3,3), facing up, holding nothing\n\nTo make soup, we need to put three onions in a pot. Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlice is at (5,1), which is above (5,0), but (5,0) is a kitchen counter, I think? Tile types: kitchen counter at (5,0)? Let's list kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), etc. Yes, (5,0) is a kitchen counter.\n\nAlice at (5,1), facing down. Down from (5,1) is (5,0), which is a kitchen counter. But kitchen counter is not empty; it's a tile that can hold items, but the tile itself is not walkable? No, players can walk on empty tiles, but kitchen counters are specific tiles.\n\nTile types:\n- Empty tile: walkable\n- Dispensers, pots, serving counter, kitchen counter are non-empty tiles; players cannot walk on them, but can interact if adjacent and facing.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So dispensers, pots, etc., are obstacles; you can't stand on them. You can only interact when adjacent and facing.\n\nKitchen counters are also non-empty tiles, so you can't walk on them.\n\nSo grid: positions like (5,0) is a kitchen counter tile, so not walkable. Alice at (5,1) is an empty tile, I assume, since it's not listed in non-empty.\n\n(5,1) is not in the kitchen counter list, so it should be empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) should be empty.\n\nNow, Alice at (5,1), facing down. Down is (5,0), which is a kitchen counter. Since she's facing it and adjacent, she can interact with it.\n\nBut (5,0) is a kitchen counter; it might have something or not. In the non-empty kitchen counter, only (5,2) is mentioned to have an onion, so (5,0) is empty, I think.\n\n\"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" lists only (5,2) as having an onion, so other kitchen counters are empty unless specified.\n\nSimilarly for pots, all empty.\n\nSo Alice at (5,1), facing down towards (5,0). (5,0) is a kitchen counter, empty. She can interact to place her onion there, but she's holding an onion, and if she interacts with a kitchen counter, she can place the item if the counter is empty.\n\nBut we might not want to place it; we need onions for soup.\n\nAlternatively, she can move to access other things.\n\nShe could go to the pot to add onion.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlice at (5,1). To go to (4,0) or (3,0), she needs to move left and down.\n\n(5,1) to (4,1) is left, then (4,1) to (4,0) is down. (4,1) should be empty tile.\n\n(4,0) is a pot, so not walkable, so she can stand at (4,1) and face down to interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nSimilarly for (3,0).\n\nBut currently, she is facing down at (5,1), so she is facing (5,0), which is kitchen counter.\n\nBob is at (3,3), facing up. Up from (3,3) is (3,4), which is an onion dispenser.\n\n(3,4) is an onion dispenser, so if Bob interacts while facing it, he can grab an onion since he's empty-handed.\n\nHe is at (3,3), facing up, so adjacent to (3,4) and facing it, so he can interact to grab an onion.\n\nBut he needs to be on an empty tile adjacent and facing the tile.\n\nHe is on (3,3), which is empty, facing up to (3,4), which is dispenser, so yes, he can interact to grab an onion.\n\nSimilarly, there's an onion on kitchen counter at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\nAlice is at (5,1), which is above (5,2)? (5,1) to (5,2) is down? Coordinates: y=1 to y=2 is down or up?\n\nIn the move actions: U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1). So y increases up? Let's see.\n\nMove actions: U (x, y+1), so y+1 is up, D (x, y-1) is down, so y=0 is bottom, y=4 is top? Not specified, but from context.\n\nFor example, Alice at (5,1), orientation D, which is down, so decreasing y.\n\nIn move: D (x, y-1), so y decreases when going down, so y=0 is lower than y=1.\n\nSimilarly, U (x, y+1), y increases up.\n\nSo (5,1) to (5,2) is up? U (x, y+1) to (5,2), so from (5,1) to (5,2) is up, since y from 1 to 2 is +1.\n\nBut Alice is at (5,1) facing down, which is towards y=0.\n\n(5,2) is at higher y, so down from (5,1) is (5,0), up is (5,2).\n\nAlice at (5,1), facing down (towards (5,0)).\n\n(5,2) is above her at (5,2), which is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nTo interact with (5,2), she needs to be adjacent and facing it. (5,2) is directly above (5,1), so if she faces up, she can interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (3,3) facing up to (3,4), onion dispenser.\n\nNow, to make soup, we need to fill a pot with 3 onions.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nWe have onions: Alice has one, kitchen counter (5,2) has one, and we can get more from dispensers.\n\nAlso, after cooking, we need plates to serve and deliver.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nCooking takes 5 turns for the onion recipe.\n\nCurrent turn is 29, so if we start cooking now, it finishes at turn 34.\n\nThen serve and deliver for reward.\n\nBut we need to collect the ingredients first.\n\nAlice is holding an onion, she can add it to a pot.\n\nBut pots are empty, so adding one onion won't start cooking; need three.\n\nShe could place it on a counter or add directly.\n\nSince there's an onion on (5,2), which is close to her.\n\nLet me list positions:\n\n- Alice: (5,1), holding onion\n\n- Onion at (5,2) on counter\n\n- Bob: (3,3), empty, facing up to onion dispenser (3,4)\n\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n\n- Serving at (7,2)\n\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n\nFirst, Bob can grab an onion from (3,4) since he is facing it and adjacent. He can interact to grab it.\n\nAt turn 29, Bob can perform an action.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can act.\n\nBut we need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nThe task is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice over the next H turns. It says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the answer format, it's only Alice's actions. Let me read.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the answer format, it's only listed as Turn t: action, implying Alice's actions.\n\nBut to coordinate, we might need Bob's actions too, but the output is only Alice's actions.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume Bob will cooperate based on the plan, or I specify both.\n\nThe answer format shows only actions for turns, labeled as a_{t}, and it says \"for Alice\", so I think I need to output only Alice's actions.\n\nBut to maximize, I need to consider what Bob should do.\n\nThe user says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can include Bob's actions if needed, but the answer format might be for Alice only.\n\nLooking at the boxed answer, it has \"Turn t: action\", without specifying player, but from context, since it's \"for Alice\", I think it's Alice's actions.\n\nBut to make it clear, I should output Alice's actions for each turn.\n\nI think for the plan, I can describe what both should do, but the output should be Alice's actions as per format.\n\nPerhaps I need to output only Alice's actions, assuming Bob will be controlled separately, but since I need to coordinate, I should plan with Bob in mind.\n\nThe task is to help Alice collaborate, so I can define what Alice should do, and suggest what Bob should do for coordination.\n\nBut in the output, only Alice's actions are listed.\n\nLet me see the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nAnd it says \"a_t \\in {U,D,L,R,I,S}\", so it's actions for Alice.\n\nSo I need to output a sequence of actions for Alice only.\n\nBut to coordinate, I should consider what Bob is likely to do or should do.\n\nSince Bob's actions are not output, I need to plan Alice's actions assuming Bob will act optimally or based on history.\n\nFrom history, Bob's recent actions: U, L, L, L, U. He was at, say, starting from (4,4) or something? Let's trace.\n\nBob's position now (3,3), orientation U.\n\nActions: U, L, L, L, U.\n\nAssume at turn 24, he was at some position.\n\nActions are listed with most recent last.\n\nAction history: U (most recent), then L, L, L, U. So sequence: first U, then L, L, L, then U.\n\nMost recent action is last in array: \"with the most recent action listed at the end of the array.\"\n\nSo for Bob: action history: U, L, L, L, U\n\nSo turn 25: U? Let's index.\n\nTurn t_1=29, action history is for past turns, say turns 24 to 28 or 25 to 29? Not specified how many, but up to 5 turns.\n\n\"at most 5\", so turns 25 to 29 or 24 to 28? It says \"in the passed several turns(at most 5)\", and \"game turn: t_1=29\", so actions from turn 24 to 28 or 25 to 29?\n\nTypically, action at turn t affects state at t+1, but let's not worry.\n\nBob's actions: let's say from turn 24: U, 25: L, 26: L, 27: L, 28: U, to position (3,3) facing U.\n\nFrom (3,3), U would be to (3,4), but (3,4) is dispenser, not walkable, so if he tried to move U, he couldn't, but he can change orientation or interact.\n\nIn action history, it's the actions taken, not necessarily successful, but from the state, he is at (3,3) facing U, so he might have tried to move U but couldn't, so he changed orientation or something. But the actions are U,L,L,L,U, and he ended at (3,3) facing U.\n\nSimilarly for Alice.\n\nBut for planning, I'll focus on current state.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nTo make soup, we need 3 onions in a pot.\n\nAlice has one onion.\n\nThere's one onion on (5,2) counter.\n\nBob can grab one from dispenser.\n\nAlso, pots are empty.\n\nFirst, Alice can add her onion to a pot, but since we need three, it's better to collect all or have multiple players add.\n\nAlice is at (5,1), facing down.\n\nShe can move to access the pot or the counter.\n\n(5,2) is above her, at (5,2), which has an onion. To interact, she needs to face up.\n\nCurrently facing down, so she can change orientation to up.\n\nThen interact to pick up the onion, but she is holding an onion, so she can't pick up; she can only place or interact with other things.\n\nInteract with kitchen counter: if player is holding an item and counter is empty, she can place it; if player empty and counter occupied, she can pick up.\n\nHere, Alice holding onion, counter at (5,2) occupied with onion, so she cannot place or pick up; it's occupied, so she can't do anything with it if she is holding something. Only if she is empty, she can pick up.\n\nFrom rules: \"Pick up items (if player is empty-handed and counter is occupied) or place items (if player is holding an item and counter is empty).\"\n\nSo for (5,2), it is occupied, so Alice can only interact if she is empty-handed to pick up. But she is holding an onion, so she cannot pick up the onion from counter; she would need to place her onion somewhere first.\n\nSimilarly, she can add to pot if near.\n\nBob at (3,3) facing up, can interact with (3,4) dispenser to grab an onion since he is empty.\n\nThen he can go to a pot to add it.\n\nBut pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are below.\n\nAlso, after cooking, we need plates to serve.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nCooking time 5 turns.\n\nNow, let's plan for Alice.\n\nFirst, Alice should go to a pot to add her onion.\n\nNearest pot: (4,0) or (3,0).\n\nFrom (5,1), to (4,0): first move left to (4,1), then down to (4,0)? But (4,0) is pot, not walkable, so she can go to (4,1) and face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nSimilarly for (3,0).\n\n(4,1) is empty tile, I assume.\n\nAlice at (5,1), facing down. To go to (4,1), she needs to move left.\n\nThen from (4,1), face down to interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nBut she can interact to add ingredient if pot not full.\n\nPot is empty, so she can add onion.\n\nBut adding one onion doesn't start cooking.\n\nThen we need more onions.\n\nBob can add onions.\n\nAlso, the onion on (5,2) can be used.\n\nBut Alice is holding one, so after adding to pot, she is empty, then she can go to (5,2) to pick up that onion.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is above (5,1). From (5,1), (5,2) is up, so if she faces up, she can interact.\n\nCurrently at (5,1), after adding to pot, she would be at (4,1) or wherever.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 29: Alice can move left to (4,1). Action L.\n\nThen turn 30: from (4,1), she can face down (if not already) and interact to add onion to pot at (4,0). So action I, but she needs to be facing down. At (4,1), she can move down or interact.\n\nPosition (4,1), to interact with (4,0) below, she needs to face down.\n\nIf she just moved to (4,1) from left, her orientation might be left or something? Orientation changes with move or separately.\n\nActions: Move actions change position and orientation to the direction moved.\n\nChange orientation action changes only orientation, no move if adjacent tile not empty.\n\nFor Alice, at turn 29, position (5,1), orientation D.\n\nIf she moves left to (4,1), that would change her position to (4,1) and orientation to L (left).\n\nThen at (4,1), orientation L, she is not facing down, so to interact with (4,0) down, she needs to face down first.\n\nSo she can change orientation to down, then interact.\n\nOr she can move down, but (4,0) is not empty, so she cannot move down; she can only change orientation or interact or stay.\n\nFrom (4,1), if she moves down to (4,0), but (4,0) is pot, not empty, so she cannot move there. So she can only change orientation to down, then interact.\n\nSimilarly, she could interact directly if facing, but not facing down yet.\n\nSo sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 29: move left to (4,1), orientation becomes L.\n\nTurn 30: change orientation to down (D), so now facing (4,0).\n\nTurn 31: interact (I) to add onion to pot at (4,0). Now pot has one onion, Alice empty-handed.\n\nNow, she is at (4,1), empty, facing down.\n\nNow, there is an onion on kitchen counter at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is right and up from (4,1)? (4,1) to (5,2) is not adjacent; adjacent tiles share edge, so (4,1) adjacent are (4,0) down, (4,2) up, (3,1) left, (5,1) right.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to (4,1); it's diagonal. So not directly interactable.\n\nAlice needs to move to (5,1) or (5,2) but (5,2) not walkable, so to (5,1), then face up to interact with (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move right to (5,1).\n\nTurn 32: move right to (5,1), orientation becomes R (right).\n\nAt (5,1), (5,2) is above, so she needs to face up to interact.\n\nTurn 33: change orientation to up (U).\n\nTurn 34: interact to pick up onion from (5,2) counter. Now she has an onion.\n\nThen she can add this to the pot.\n\nBut the pot at (4,0) has one onion, so adding another makes two.\n\nWe need a third onion.\n\nBob can provide that.\n\nBob is at (3,3), facing up, can interact to grab onion from (3,4) dispenser.\n\nTurn 29: Bob can interact to grab onion. Then he can go down to add to pot.\n\nFrom (3,3), to go to pots at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\n(3,0) is below, so he can move down to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan Bob, but for Alice, we need to coordinate.\n\nSince Alice is adding the second onion, but we need third.\n\nAfter Alice picks up onion from counter at turn 34, she has onion, then she can go back to (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nBut from (5,1), to (4,1) is left, then face down to interact.\n\nBut at that time, Bob might have added an onion or something.\n\nLet's think about Bob.\n\nAt turn 29, Bob can interact to grab onion from (3,4) since facing it.\n\nThen he can move down to add to pot.\n\nFrom (3,3), move down to (3,2). (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (3,2)? Tile types: kitchen counter at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). Yes, (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, so not empty tile.\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (3,2) is not possible, since not empty.\n\nHe can move left or right or up, but up is dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo from (3,3), he can move down? No, (3,2) not walkable.\n\nMove left to (2,3), or right to (4,3), or change orientation.\n\n(3,3) adjacent tiles: up (3,4) dispenser, not walkable; down (3,2) kitchen counter, not walkable; left (2,3), right (4,3).\n\n(2,3) and (4,3) should be empty tiles.\n\nHe can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nThen from there, down to (2,2) or (4,2), but (2,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters, not walkable.\n\nTo access pot at (3,0) or (4,0), he needs to be at (3,1) or (4,1) etc.\n\n(3,1) should be empty.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down? No, blocked.\n\nMove left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? Not walkable.\n\nThe only way is to move to (3,1) directly? But not adjacent.\n\nHe needs to go through (4,3) or (2,3), then down to (4,2) or (2,2), but those are counters, not walkable, so he can't stand on them.\n\nTo interact with pot, he needs to be adjacent to the pot tile.\n\nFor pot at (3,0), adjacent empty tiles are (3,1), (2,0), (4,0) but (4,0) is pot, not empty, so (3,1) and (2,0)? (2,0) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\nKitchen counter at (2,0), so not empty.\n\nSo for pot at (3,0), the adjacent tiles are: up (3,1), down not exist or out of bound, left (2,0) kitchen counter, right (4,0) pot.\n\nSo only (3,1) is an empty tile where a player can stand to interact with (3,0) by facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), adjacent empty tile is (4,1), since (3,0) left, (5,0) right kitchen counter, (4,-1) invalid, so (4,1) up.\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is empty tile.\n\nBob at (3,3), to get to (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he cannot.\n\nHe can move left to (2,3), then from (2,3), down to (2,2)? Not walkable.\n\nMove down from (2,3) to (2,2) no, or to (2,1)? (2,1) should be empty.\n\nCoordinates: y=3 to y=2 is down, but (2,2) is kitchen counter, so from (2,3) move down to (2,2) not possible.\n\nMove to (2,3), then he can move down? Only if (2,2) empty, but it's not.\n\nSo from (2,3), he can only move left, right, or up, but not down.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), he can move right to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is empty, I assume.\n\nThen from (4,3), down to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot move down.\n\nThen from (4,3), move down not possible, so move left, right, or up.\n\nTo reach the pots, he needs to go to (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move right to (4,3), then right to (5,3)? (5,3) should be empty, then from (5,3) down to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps there is a path.\n\nList all non-empty tiles from the lists.\n\nNon-empty tiles: all dispensers, pots, serving, kitchen counters.\n\nKitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nOnion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\nPlate dispenser: (0,2)\n\nPots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\nServing counter: (7,2)\n\nSo empty tiles are the walkable spaces.\n\nFor example, (3,3) is empty, as not listed.\n\n(4,3) not listed, empty.\n\n(5,1) empty, etc.\n\nTo go from (3,3) to (3,1):\n\n(3,3) to (3,2) not possible, kitchen counter.\n\nSo must go around.\n\nFor example, move left to (2,3), then down? (2,3) to (2,2) not possible, kitchen counter.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4)? (2,4) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(2,3) adjacent: up (2,4) kitchen counter, down (2,2) kitchen counter, left (1,3), right (3,3).\n\n(1,3) should be empty? Kitchen counter at (0,3), (7,3), not (1,3), so (1,3) empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) to (4,3) empty.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then down to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, should be empty? Kitchen counters include (0,2) plate dispenser, but (0,2) is plate dispenser, which is non-empty, but (1,2) not listed, so empty.\n\nKitchen counters are separate, but all non-walkable tiles are listed as specific types.\n\n(1,2) is not in any list, so it should be empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1), etc.\n\nFrom (3,3), move left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1).\n\nThat's long.\n\nOr from (3,3) move right to (4,3), then down not possible, so right to (5,3), then down to (5,2) not possible, so down to (5,1)? (5,3) to (5,2) not walkable, so move to (5,3), then to (5,2) no, so to (6,3) or down to (5,2) no.\n\n(5,3) adjacent: up (5,4) kitchen counter, down (5,2) kitchen counter, left (4,3), right (6,3).\n\n(6,3) not listed, empty? Kitchen counter at (6,4), (6,0), but (6,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (6,3), down to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, empty? Serving counter at (7,2), not (6,2), so (6,2) empty.\n\nThen to (6,1), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), it's far.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2) no, so move to (4,3), then to (4,4)? (4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nThe only direct way is to go to (3,1) via (4,1) or something.\n\n(4,1) is empty, as Alice was there.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move right to (4,3), then down not possible, so move to (4,3), then right to (5,3), then down to (5,2) no, so to (5,3), then to (6,3), then down to (6,2), then left to (5,2) no, (5,2) not walkable.\n\nHe can stand at (5,1) and face up to interact with (5,2), but for pots, he needs to be at (4,1) for (4,0) or (3,1) for (3,0).\n\n(3,1) is empty.\n\nHow to get to (3,1) from (3,3)?\n\nSince (3,2) is blocked, he can move to (4,3), then to (4,2) no, so to (4,3), then to (4,4) no, so he must go to (3,4) but not walkable.\n\nPerhaps (3,1) can be reached from left or right.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(2,1) should be empty.\n\nFrom (3,3), move left to (2,3), then from (2,3), move down to (2,2) no, so move to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nThat's 5 moves: L from (3,3) to (2,3), L to (1,3), D to (1,2), D to (1,1), R to (2,1), R to (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,1), face down to interact with (3,0) pot.\n\nSimilarly, shorter if possible, but no direct path.\n\nFrom (3,3) move right to (4,3), then to (4,2) no, so to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,2) no, so to (5,3), then to (5,4) no, so to (6,3), then D to (6,2), then D to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1).\n\nThen at (4,1), interact with (4,0).\n\nBut (4,1) is closer to Alice now.\n\nFor Bob, it's better to grab an onion and then go down, but it will take time.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAlice has onion, at (5,1).\n\nInstead of adding to pot now, she can place the onion on a counter for later or something.\n\nBut we need to use it.\n\nSince Bob is near onion dispenser, he can grab onions.\n\nLet's have Bob grab an onion at turn 29.\n\nThen Alice can go to the counter to pick up the onion there after becoming empty.\n\nBut she needs to add her current onion first.\n\nAlternative: Alice can place her onion on an empty counter, then pick up the onion on (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied, so she needs to place on another counter.\n\nFor example, there might be empty kitchen counters.\n\nKitchen counters at (0,0) etc, but far.\n\nNearby, (5,0) is kitchen counter, empty.\n\nAlice at (5,1), facing down to (5,0), which is empty kitchen counter.\n\nSo she can interact to place her onion on (5,0).\n\nThen she is empty, then she can face up to interact with (5,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen she has that onion, and her onion is on (5,0), which can be picked up later.\n\nBut (5,0) is below, she can pick it up later.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps better to add to pot directly.\n\nLet's start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nAt turn 29, Alice can move to (4,1) and add to pot.\n\nTurn 29: Alice move L to (4,1), orientation L.\n\nTurn 30: change orientation to D (down), now facing (4,0).\n\nTurn 31: interact I to add onion to pot at (4,0). Pot now has 1 onion, Alice empty.\n\nThen turn 32: Alice move R to (5,1), orientation R.\n\nTurn 33: change orientation to U (up), facing (5,2).\n\nTurn 34: interact I to pick up onion from (5,2). Now Alice holding onion.\n\nThen she can add this to the pot at (4,0).\n\nFrom (5,1), move L to (4,1), then face down to interact.\n\nTurn 35: move L to (4,1), orientation L.\n\nTurn 36: change orientation to D, facing (4,0).\n\nTurn 37: interact I to add onion. Pot now has 2 onions.\n\nWe need a third onion.\n\nBob can add it.\n\nBob at (3,3), at turn 29, he can interact I to grab onion from (3,4) dispenser. Now holding onion.\n\nThen he needs to go to the pot.\n\nTo add to (4,0), he can go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), move to (4,3) first.\n\nTurn 29 for Bob: I to grab onion.\n\nTurn 30: move R to (4,3), orientation R.\n\nTurn 31: move D to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot move down.\n\nMove to (4,3), then to (5,3) or down not possible.\n\nMove to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,2) no, so to (5,3), then to (5,4) no, so to (6,3), then D to (6,2), then D to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1).\n\nThat's many turns.\n\nFrom (4,3), move down not possible, so move to (3,3) but occupied or not.\n\n(3,3) is empty, but he is at (4,3), move left to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), same problem.\n\nHe can go to (3,1) as earlier.\n\nBut it's slow.\n\nNotice that (4,1) is currently empty, and Alice is not there yet in the sequence.\n\nIn Alice's sequence, at turn 32 she is at (5,1), etc.\n\nFor Bob, to reach (4,1), one way is from (4,3) move to (4,4) no, so move to (5,3), then to (5,2) no, so to (5,3), then to (5,1)? Not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,3), move to (5,3) (turn 30 for Bob: move R to (5,3)? From (4,3) move right to (5,3).\n\nThen from (5,3), move down to (5,2) not possible, so move to (6,3) or down no.\n\n(5,3) to (5,2) not possible, so move to (6,3), then down to (6,2), then down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), then to (4,1) from (5,1) move left.\n\nBut (4,1) is the tile.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) is left, then to (4,1) left again.\n\nBut (6,1) to (5,1) is left, (5,1) to (4,1) left.\n\nSo from Bob at (3,3) at turn 29:\n\nTurn 29: I to grab onion.\n\nTurn 30: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 31: move R to (5,3)  // (4,3) to (5,3) right\n\nTurn 32: move R to (6,3)  // (5,3) to (6,3) right\n\nTurn 33: move D to (6,2)  // (6,3) to (6,2) down\n\nTurn 34: move D to (6,1)  // (6,2) to (6,1) down\n\nTurn 35: move L to (5,1)  // (6,1) to (5,1) left\n\nTurn 36: move L to (4,1)  // (5,1) to (4,1) left\n\nThen at (4,1), he can face down and interact to add onion to pot.\n\nBut at turn 36, Alice is also at (4,1) in her sequence at turn 35? Let's synchronize turns.\n\nTurn 29: both act.\n\nAlice turn 29: move L to (4,1)\n\nBob turn 29: I to grab onion\n\nTurn 30: Alice change orientation to D (at (4,1))\n\nBob move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 31: Alice I to add onion to pot, now pot at (4,0) has 1 onion, Alice empty.\n\nBob move R to (5,3)  // from (4,3) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 32: Alice move R to (5,1)  // from (4,1) to (5,1)\n\nBob move R to (6,3)  // (5,3) to (6,3)\n\nTurn 33: Alice change orientation to U (at (5,1), facing up to (5,2))\n\nBob move D to (6,2)  // (6,3) to (6,2) down\n\nTurn 34: Alice I to pick up onion from (5,2), now holding onion.\n\nBob move D to (6,1)  // (6,2) to (6,1) down\n\nTurn 35: Alice move L to (4,1)  // (5,1) to (4,1) left, orientation L\n\nBob move L to (5,1)  // (6,1) to (5,1) left\n\nTurn 36: Alice change orientation to D (at (4,1), facing down)\n\nBob move L to (4,1)  // (5,1) to (4,1) left, but at turn 35, Alice moved to (4,1), so at turn 36, (4,1) is occupied by Alice, so Bob cannot move there.\n\nConflict.\n\nAt turn 35, Alice is at (4,1), Bob is at (5,1), he moves left to (4,1), but it's occupied, so he cannot move, or he can change orientation or something.\n\nBut in this case, he might stay or find another way.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nBob can add to the other pot at (3,0).\n\nBut (3,0) requires being at (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can go to (3,1) via (2,3), etc.\n\nTurn 29 Bob: I grab onion\n\nTurn 30: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 31: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (1,2)\n\nTurn 33: move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 35: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 36: at (3,1), face down to interact with (3,0) pot.\n\nThen add onion.\n\nBut the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions, this is separate.\n\nWe can have two pots cooking, but recipe is for 3 onions, so each pot needs 3 onions.\n\nCurrently, we are adding to one pot.\n\nIn Alice's sequence, at turn 37 she adds second onion to (4,0), so it has 2, need third.\n\nBob can add to the same pot.\n\nBut at (4,1), Alice is there at turn 35 and 36.\n\nAt turn 36, Alice at (4,1) facing down, turn 37 she interacts to add second onion.\n\nThen she moves away.\n\nAfter adding, Alice is empty at (4,1).\n\nThen Bob can come to (4,1) to add the third onion.\n\nBut Bob is far.\n\nFrom above, at turn 35, Bob is at (3,1) if he went to (3,0) pot, but that's for different pot.\n\nLet's have Bob add to the same pot.\n\nAt turn 36, Alice adds second onion, then turn 37 she can move away, say to (5,1).\n\nThen Bob can go to (4,1) to add.\n\nBut Bob needs to be there.\n\nIn the first path, at turn 35 Bob is at (5,1), at turn 36 he can move to (4,1) if empty.\n\nBut at turn 36, Alice is at (4,1), so he cannot.\n\nAt turn 37, Alice at (4,1) interacting, then after interact, she is at (4,1), then she can move.\n\nTurn 37: Alice I to add onion, then at (4,1) empty.\n\nThen turn 38: Alice can move to (5,1) or something.\n\nThen Bob can move to (4,1) at turn 38 or later.\n\nBut Bob is at (5,1) at turn 35, then turn 36 he might not move or change orientation.\n\nLet's list turns.\n\nTurn 35: Alice at (4,1), move L to (4,1)? No, at turn 35: in Alice's sequence, at turn 35 she moves L to (4,1) from (5,1), so at turn 35 end, Alice at (4,1), orientation L.\n\nBob at turn 35: in his path, at turn 35 he is at (5,1) from moving L from (6,1).\n\nTurn 35: Bob move L to (5,1) from (6,1).\n\nAt (5,1), which is empty, Alice is at (4,1).\n\nTurn 36: Alice change orientation to D at (4,1), so facing down.\n\nBob at (5,1), can move L to (4,1), but (4,1) occupied by Alice, so he cannot move there. He can change orientation or stay or interact, but (5,1) adjacent: (5,0) kitchen counter down, (5,2) kitchen counter up, (4,1) left, (6,1) right.\n\n(4,1) occupied, (5,0) not walkable, (5,2) not walkable, (6,1) is empty? Kitchen counter at (6,0), (6,4), not (6,1), so (6,1) empty.\n\nSo Bob can move R to (6,1) or stay or change orientation.\n\nBut he wants to add onion to pot, so he can go to (4,1) later.\n\nTurn 36: Bob could stay or move to (6,1).\n\nThen at turn 37: Alice at (4,1) interacts I to add onion to pot, now pot has 2 onions, Alice empty.\n\nThen after action, Alice at (4,1).\n\nTurn 37: Bob at (6,1) or (5,1), say he stayed at (5,1), then he can move L to (4,1), but (4,1) has Alice, so cannot.\n\nAt turn 37, Alice is at (4,1) interacting, so during interaction, she is there, so tile occupied.\n\nAfter interaction, turn 37 end, Alice at (4,1) empty.\n\nThen turn 38: Alice can move, say R to (5,1), freeing (4,1).\n\nThen Bob at (5,1) can move L to (4,1) at turn 38.\n\nThen at (4,1), he can face down and interact to add onion.\n\nBut this is slow, and cooking hasn't started yet.\n\nCooking starts when third ingredient is added.\n\nCurrently at turn 38, Bob adds third onion, cooking starts.\n\nThen cooking takes 5 turns, so ready at turn 43.\n\nThen serve and deliver.\n\nBut we need plates.\n\nFirst, let's optimize.\n\nBob is at (3,3), which is near the onion dispensers, so he can grab onions and place them on a counter near the pots for Alice to add, but Alice is adding.\n\nAlice can focus on one pot.\n\nSince there's a onion on counter at (5,2), and Alice can add her onion, then pick up that, but we need third.\n\nAt turn 29, Bob grabs onion.\n\nInstead of going down, he can place the onion on a counter near pots.\n\nFor example, kitchen counter at (4,2) or (3,2), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, empty.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nBob can go to (4,2) but not walkable, so he needs to be adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move to (4,3), then face down to interact with (4,2) kitchen counter.\n\n(4,2) is below (4,3).\n\nAt (4,3), facing down, he can interact with (4,2) to place the onion if counter empty.\n\n(4,2) is empty kitchen counter, so he can place it.\n\nThen the onion is on (4,2), which is close to the pot.\n\nThen Alice can pick it up and add to pot.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nTurn 29 Bob: I grab onion from (3,4)\n\nTurn 30: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 31: change orientation to D (down) to face (4,2)\n\nTurn 32: interact I to place onion on (4,2) counter. Now Bob empty.\n\nThen the onion is on (4,2).\n\nNow, for Alice, in her sequence, at turn 31 she added first onion to pot, empty at (4,1).\n\nThen turn 32 she moves to (5,1)\n\nTurn 33 she faces up to (5,2)\n\nTurn 34 she picks up onion from (5,2), holding onion.\n\nThen turn 35 she moves to (4,1), turn 36 faces down, turn 37 adds second onion to pot.\n\nNow at turn 37, pot has 2 onions.\n\nThe third onion is on (4,2) counter.\n\nAlice at (4,1) after adding, empty.\n\n(4,2) is above, so from (4,1), she can face up to interact with (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice at (4,1), empty-handed, so she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nBut she needs to face up.\n\nCurrently at turn 37, she just added, facing down.\n\nTurn 38: Alice change orientation to U (up) at (4,1), facing (4,2)\n\nTurn 39: interact I to pick up onion from (4,2), now holding onion.\n\nTurn 40: since facing up, she can interact with pot? No, pot is at (4,0) down, so she needs to face down.\n\nTurn 40: change orientation to D (down)\n\nTurn 41: interact I to add onion to pot. Now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking start at turn 41.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so ready at turn 46.\n\nThen need to serve with plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can get plates.\n\nBut first, let's complete the cooking start.\n\nIn the above, it took many turns.\n\nFrom turn 29 to turn 41 to start cooking, 12 turns, then 5 to cook, so ready at 46.\n\nThen serve and deliver.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAlice is at (5,1) at turn 29.\n\nInstead of going to (4,1), she can directly go to (5,2) but not walkable, so she can interact with (5,2) from (5,1) by facing up.\n\nBut she is holding onion, so she can't pick up the onion on (5,2).\n\nShe can place her onion on (5,0) first.\n\nTurn 29: at (5,1) facing down, she can interact I to place onion on (5,0) kitchen counter. Since (5,0) is empty, she can place it. Now Alice empty.\n\nTurn 30: change orientation to U (up), facing (5,2)\n\nTurn 31: interact I to pick up onion from (5,2), now holding that onion.\n\nThen she can go to pot to add it.\n\nFrom (5,1), move L to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut she has one onion on (5,0) and one in hand.\n\nThen she can add the one in hand to pot, then pick up the one on (5,0).\n\nBut similar.\n\nOr, after picking up from (5,2), she can add to pot directly.\n\nTurn 32: move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 33: change orientation D\n\nTurn 34: I add onion to pot. Pot has 1 onion, Alice empty.\n\nThen she can go back to (5,1) to pick up the onion on (5,0).\n\nTurn 35: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 36: change orientation D to face (5,0)\n\nTurn 37: interact I to pick up onion from (5,0), now holding onion.\n\nTurn 38: move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 39: change orientation D\n\nTurn 40: I add onion to pot. Pot has 2 onions.\n\nStill need third.\n\nBob needs to add one.\n\nWith Bob placing on counter, it might be faster.\n\nAt turn 29 Bob: I grab onion\n\nTurn 30: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 31: change orientation D to face (4,2)\n\nTurn 32: I place onion on (4,2)\n\nNow onion on (4,2).\n\nFor Alice, with the above, at turn 40 she adds second onion, pot has 2.\n\nThen at (4,1), she can face up to pick up from (4,2).\n\nTurn 41: change orientation U at (4,1)\n\nTurn 42: I pick up onion from (4,2), holding\n\nTurn 43: change orientation D\n\nTurn 44: I add to pot. Cooking starts at turn 44.\n\nBetter than 41.\n\nCooking start turn 44, ready at 49.\n\nStill late.\n\nAlice can add her onion faster.\n\nAt turn 29: Alice at (5,1) facing down, I to place onion on (5,0). Empty.\n\nTurn 30: U to face up.\n\nTurn 31: I to pick up onion from (5,2). Holding onion.\n\nTurn 32: L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 33: D to face down.\n\nTurn 34: I to add onion to pot. Pot has 1, Alice empty.\n\nNow, the onion on (5,0) is there, and Bob placed on (4,2).\n\nAlice can pick up from (4,2) or from (5,0).\n\n(4,2) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,1), turn 35: U to face up.\n\nTurn 36: I to pick up onion from (4,2). Holding onion.\n\nTurn 37: D to face down.\n\nTurn 38: I to add to pot. Pot has 2.\n\nNeed third from Bob or elsewhere.\n\nBob placed on (4,2), but Alice picked it up.\n\nBob needs to add another or there is the onion on (5,0).\n\nAlice can go to (5,0) to pick up.\n\nFrom (4,1), turn 39: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 40: D to face down (5,0)\n\nTurn 41: I to pick up onion from (5,0). Holding.\n\nTurn 42: L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 43: D to face down\n\nTurn 44: I to add to pot. Pot has 3, cooking start turn 44.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at turn 32, Bob placed onion on (4,2), which Alice used at turn 36.\n\nFor the third onion, Bob can grab another onion and add.\n\nBob after placing at turn 32, empty at (4,3).\n\nTurn 33: he can face up to (4,4) or something, but to grab another onion.\n\nAt (4,3), facing down or what.\n\nAfter turn 32, Bob at (4,3), orientation down? After placing, orientation might be down.\n\nHe can change orientation to up to face (4,4) dispenser.\n\nTurn 33: U to face up.\n\nTurn 34: I to grab onion from (4,4). Holding onion.\n\nThen he can add to pot.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can go to (4,1) to add, but (4,2) not walkable.\n\nHe can face down to interact with (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter, he can place or pick up, but to add to pot, he needs to be at (4,1).\n\nSo move to (4,3), then to (5,3), etc to (4,1) as before.\n\nSlow.\n\nHe can place the onion on a counter near pot, but (4,2) has onion or not.\n\nAt turn 32, he placed on (4,2), Alice picked at turn 36, so at turn 34, (4,2) might be empty or occupied.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 34, (4,2) has onion from Bob.\n\nBut Bob can go to (4,1) to add directly if possible.\n\nBut difficult.\n\nPerhaps use the other pot.\n\nBut let's accept that cooking starts around turn 44.\n\nThen after cooking, need to serve.\n\nSoup cooked at turn 49.\n\nThen need to serve it with a plate.\n\nAlice or Bob can get a plate from (0,2).\n\n(0,2) is far.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nThen go to pot, serve soup, then to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFor example, Alice can go get plate after adding the last onion.\n\nBut at turn 44, she is at (4,1), after adding, empty.\n\nThen she can go to (0,2) to get plate.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): many moves.\n\nFor example, left to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), but (0,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\nTo access (0,2), adjacent empty tile.\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser, non-empty, so players can stand on adjacent empty tile facing it.\n\nAdjacent to (0,2): up (0,3) kitchen counter, down (0,1) kitchen counter, left invalid, right (1,2).\n\n(1,2) should be empty tile.\n\nSo stand at (1,2), face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nSimilarly, to reach (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then to (1,2).\n\n(1,1) to (1,2) is up.\n\nThen at (1,2), face left to interact.\n\nMany moves.\n\nSimilarly, from pot to serving.\n\nServing at (7,2), adjacent empty tile, e.g. (6,2) or (7,1), but (7,1) kitchen counter, not walkable, so (6,2) or (7,3).\n\n(7,3) kitchen counter, not walkable, so only (6,2) is empty.\n\nStand at (6,2), face right to interact with (7,2).\n\nTo reach (6,2) from (4,1), etc.\n\nThis will take many turns.\n\nPerhaps Bob can get the plate while Alice is adding ingredients.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,3) or something.\n\nAt turn 29, after grabbing onion, he placed it, then he can go to get plate.\n\nBut let's calculate the number of turns.\n\nCooking start at turn 44, ready at 49.\n\nAt turn 44, Alice at (4,1) empty.\n\nShe can go to get plate.\n\nTurn 44: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 45: move U to (5,2)? Not walkable, so move to (5,1), then to (6,1) R\n\nTurn 46: move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 47: move U to (6,2)  // (6,1) to (6,2) up\n\nAt (6,2), she can interact with serving counter later, but now to get plate.\n\nTo (0,2), from (6,2).\n\nTurn 48: move L to (5,2) not walkable, so move to (6,2), then to (6,1) D, then to (5,1) L, etc.\n\nLong way.\n\nFrom (6,2) move L to (5,2) no, so move D to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1), but that's back.\n\nTo go west, from (6,2) move D to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1), then to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then U to (1,2).\n\nTurn 48: move D to (6,1) from (6,2)\n\nTurn 49: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 50: move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 51: move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 52: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 53: move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 54: move U to (1,2)\n\nTurn 55: change orientation L to face (0,2)\n\nTurn 56: interact I to grab plate from dispenser. Now holding plate.\n\nThen she needs to go back to the pot to serve soup.\n\nPot at (4,0), from (1,2) to (4,1).\n\nTurn 57: move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 58: move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 59: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 60: move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 61: change orientation D to face (4,0)\n\nTurn 62: interact I to serve soup. If soup is cooked, she takes the soup on plate.\n\nCooking finished at turn 49, so at turn 62, it is cooked.\n\nServe, now holding soup on plate.\n\nThen to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 63: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 64: move U to (5,2) no, so move to (6,1) R from (5,1)\n\nTurn 65: move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 66: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 67: change orientation R to face (7,2)\n\nTurn 68: interact I to deliver soup. Reward 20.\n\nMany turns, from turn 29 to 68 for one soup.\n\nBut we can have Bob help.\n\nFor example, Bob can get the plate while Alice is cooking.\n\nBut cooking starts late.\n\nTo start cooking faster, Alice can add her onion directly, then Bob adds one quickly.\n\nBob at (3,3), at turn 29, he can grab onion (I).\n\nThen instead of placing, he can go directly to (3,1) to add to pot (3,0).\n\nBut to reach (3,1), it takes turns.\n\nFrom (3,3), move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 30: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 31: move D to (1,2)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 33: move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 35: change orientation D to face (3,0)\n\nTurn 36: I to add onion to pot (3,0). Pot has 1 onion.\n\nBut Alice is adding to (4,0), so different pots.\n\nThen we have two pots with one onion each, not good.\n\nWe should focus on one pot.\n\nAlice adds her onion to (4,0) at turn 31 (in first sequence).\n\nThen at turn 34, she picks up onion from (5,2) and adds at turn 37.\n\nIf Bob can add the third onion at turn 37 or so.\n\nBut from above, he can't reach fast.\n\nAt turn 29, Bob grabs onion, then moves to (4,3) at turn 30, then at (4,3), he can change orientation to down to face (4,2), but to place on counter, but then Alice can use.\n\nBut to add directly, he can't.\n\nPerhaps Alice can use the onion on (5,2) for the third, but she needs to add two, and the third from Bob.\n\nI think the fastest way is to have Bob place the onion on a counter close to the pot, and Alice picks it up immediately after adding the second.\n\nIn Alice sequence, at turn 37 she adds second onion at (4,0), empty at (4,1).\n\nIf at that time, there is an onion on (4,2), she can face up and pick it up, then add.\n\nTurn 38: U to face up\n\nTurn 39: I pick up from (4,2)\n\nTurn 40: D to face down\n\nTurn 41: I add to pot. Cooking start turn 41.\n\nBetter.\n\nFor that, Bob needs to have placed the onion on (4,2) by turn 37.\n\nBob at turn 29: I grab onion\n\nTurn 30: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 31: D to face down (4,2)\n\nTurn 32: I place on (4,2)\n\nBy turn 32, onion on (4,2).\n\nAlice at turn 37 is at (4,1) adding second onion, so at turn 38 she can pick up from (4,2).\n\nTurn 38: U face up\n\nTurn 39: I pick up onion\n\nTurn 40: D face down\n\nTurn 41: I add to pot. Cooking start turn 41.\n\nCooking ready at turn 46.\n\nNow, for plates.\n\nAlice at (4,1) empty at turn 41 after adding.\n\nShe can go get plate.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,3), empty, he can go get plate.\n\nBob at (4,3) after turn 32.\n\nTurn 33: he can move to get plate.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (0,2).\n\nTurn 33: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 34: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 35: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 36: move D to (1,2)\n\nAt (1,2), he can face left to (0,2) to grab plate.\n\nTurn 37: change orientation L to face (0,2)\n\nTurn 38: I grab plate. Now holding plate.\n\nThen he can go back to the pot to serve soup when ready.\n\nPot at (4,0), from (1,2).\n\nTurn 39: move R to (1,3)? Or to (2,1), but to (4,1).\n\nTurn 39: move D to (1,1)  // from (1,2) to (1,1) down\n\nTurn 40: move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 41: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 42: move R to (4,1)\n\nArrive at (4,1) turn 42.\n\nSoup ready at turn 46, so he can wait or something.\n\nAt (4,1), facing right or down.\n\nTurn 43: change orientation D to face (4,0)\n\nThen at turn 46, soup ready, he can interact to serve soup, but he is holding plate, so he can serve the soup onto the plate.\n\nTurn 46: I to serve soup, now holding soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 47: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 48: move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 49: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 50: change orientation R to face (7,2)\n\nTurn 51: I to deliver, reward.\n\nSo delivered at turn 51.\n\nFrom turn 29 to 51, 22 turns for one soup.\n\nBut we can start another soup.\n\nFor example, while cooking, Alice can prepare another pot.\n\nBut let's first output Alice's actions for the next few turns.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice for H turns, but H is not specified, say several turns.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should plan for the soup delivery.\n\nBut for the output, we need to list Alice's actions for a sequence.\n\nSince the cooking takes time, for Alice, after adding the last onion, she can help with plates or something.\n\nIn the above, Alice at turn 41 after adding, she is empty at (4,1).\n\nShe can go to get another onion or something.\n\nBut let's list Alice's actions from turn 29.\n\nBased on the first sequence with Bob placing on counter.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 29: move L to (4,1)  // from (5,1) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 30: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 31: I to add onion to pot at (4,0)  // pot has 1, Alice empty\n\nTurn 32: move R to (5,1)  // to (5,1)\n\nTurn 33: change orientation U to face up to (5,2)\n\nTurn 34: I to pick up onion from (5,2)  // holding onion\n\nTurn 35: move L to (4,1)  // to (4,1)\n\nTurn 36: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 37: I to add onion to pot at (4,0)  // pot has 2, Alice empty\n\nTurn 38: change orientation U to face up to (4,2)\n\nTurn 39: I to pick up onion from (4,2)  // holding onion (placed by Bob)\n\nTurn 40: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 41: I to add onion to pot at (4,0)  // cooking starts, Alice empty\n\nNow, after this, Alice is at (4,1) empty. She can go to get a plate or do something else.\n\nBut for H turns, we can stop here or continue.\n\nSince Bob is getting the plate, Alice can stay or prepare for another recipe.\n\nBut only one recipe, and pots are available.\n\nShe can start another soup in the other pot.\n\nFor example, go to onion dispenser to get onions.\n\nOnion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move to (4,2) not walkable, so to (5,1), then to (5,2) no, so to (6,1), etc to (4,4).\n\nLong way.\n\nOr to (3,4), from (4,1) move L to (3,1), then to (3,2) no, so to (3,1), then to (2,1), etc to (3,4).\n\nNot efficient.\n\nBob can handle the serving, Alice can get onions for another soup.\n\nBut let's output Alice's actions for the next 10 turns or so.\n\nFrom turn 29 to 41 is 13 turns.\n\nWe can list up to turn 41.\n\nBut turn 41 is add, so after that.\n\nFor the sequence, let's list Alice's actions from turn 29.\n\nIn the plan, we need to coordinate, but for output, only Alice's actions.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 29: L (move left to (4,1))\n\nTurn 30: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 31: I (interact to add onion to pot)\n\nTurn 32: R (move right to (5,1))\n\nTurn 33: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 34: I (interact to pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nTurn 35: L (move left to (4,1))\n\nTurn 36: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 37: I (interact to add onion to pot)\n\nTurn 38: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 39: I (interact to pick up onion from (4,2))  // assuming Bob placed it\n\nTurn 40: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 41: I (interact to add onion to pot, start cooking)\n\nThen from here, Alice can go to get a plate or something.\n\nBut to be complete, she can go towards the plate dispenser.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 43: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 44: move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 45: move U to (1,2)  // at (1,2)\n\nTurn 46: change orientation L to face (0,2)\n\nTurn 47: I to grab plate  // now holding plate\n\nThen she can go back to serve, but soup is ready at 46, Bob might serve it.\n\nIf Bob serves, she can keep the plate for next or deliver.\n\nBut to avoid conflict, she can stay or something.\n\nFor the plan, up to turn 41 is fine for the cooking start.\n\nH=10 or something, but not specified.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and we have one soup in progress, Alice can help with delivery or start another.\n\nBut for now, let's output from turn 29 for 10 turns or so.\n\nI think 10 turns is reasonable.\n\nFrom turn 29 to 38 or 39.\n\nTurn 29 to 38 is 10 actions.\n\nTurn 29 to turn 38: 10 turns.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 29: L\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: I\n\nTurn 32: R\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: I\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: I\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nAt turn 38, she changes to face up to pick up from (4,2).\n\nThen turn 39 I, etc.\n\nFor 10 turns, up to turn 38.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 38 she is at (4,1) facing up.\n\nThen she can interact at turn 39.\n\nBut for the plan, we can stop at turn 38.\n\nTo start cooking, we need up to turn 41, but 13 turns.\n\nPerhaps for the output, list as per the cooking sequence.\n\nSince the question is to plan for Alice, and we have the coordination with Bob implied.\n\nSo I think the above sequence is good.\n\nSo Alice actions:\n\nTurn 29: L\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: I\n\nTurn 32: R\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: I\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: I\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: I  // pick up onion from (4,2)\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: I  // add to pot, start cooking\n\nFor the box, list from turn 29.\n\nBut turn 29 is the current turn, so actions start from turn 29.\n\nIn the format, Turn t_1: a_{t_1} for t_1=29.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 29: L\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: I\n\nTurn 32: R\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: I\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: I\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nAnd so on, but for brevity, perhaps to turn 38 or 41.\n\nSince H is not specified, I can list until the cooking starts.\n\nBut in the output, list the actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo maximize, after cooking starts, Alice can get plates for serving.\n\nBut for the sequence, let's output from turn 29 to turn 38 for 10 actions.\n\nTurn 29 to 38 is 10 turns.\n\nActions: 29:L, 30:D, 31:I, 32:R, 33:U, 34:I, 35:L, 36:D, 37:I, 38:U\n\nAt turn 38, she faces up, ready to pick up from (4,2) at turn 39.\n\nBut turn 39 not included.\n\nIf we include turn 39: I\n\nBut 10 actions.\n\nTurn 29 to 38 inclusive is 10 turns.\n\nTurn 29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38: 10 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for Alice:\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should coordinate to cook and deliver the onion soup recipe as efficiently as possible. The recipe requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and yields a 20-point reward. Alice starts at (5,1) holding an onion, and Bob is at (3,3) facing the onion dispenser at (3,4). There is an onion on the kitchen counter at (5,2), and the pots at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty.\n\n### Coordination Plan:\n- **Alice's Role**: Add onions to the pot at (4,0). After placing her onion, pick up the onion from (5,2) and add it. Then, pick up the onion Bob places on (4,2) and add it to start cooking. Finally, assist with getting a plate or preparing another recipe.\n- **Bob's Role**: Grab an onion from (3,4) and place it on the kitchen counter at (4,2) for Alice. Then, get a plate from (0,2) to serve the cooked soup.\n- **Key Sequence**:\n  - Turn 29: Bob grabs an onion from (3,4).\n  - Turn 30-32: Bob moves to (4,3) and places the onion on (4,2).\n  - Turn 33 onwards: Bob gets a plate and serves the soup when ready.\n  - Alice adds her onion to the pot by turn 31, picks up the onion from (5,2) by turn 34, adds it by turn 37, then picks up Bob's onion from (4,2) and adds it by turn 41 to start cooking at turn 41.\n  - Cooking finishes at turn 46. Bob serves and delivers by turn 51 for the reward.\n\nAlice's actions for the next 10 turns (turns 29 to 38) focus on adding ingredients to start cooking quickly. This sequence ensures the soup starts cooking by turn 41, minimizing delays. After this, Alice can get a plate or start another soup.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 29 to 38):\n- Turn 29: Move left to (4,1) to approach the pot at (4,0).\n- Turn 30: Change orientation down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- Turn 31: Interact to add the onion to the pot at (4,0). Pot now has 1 onion; Alice is empty.\n- Turn 32: Move right to (5,1) to access the onion on (5,2).\n- Turn 33: Change orientation up to face the kitchen counter at (5,2).\n- Turn 34: Interact to pick up the onion from (5,2). Alice is now holding an onion.\n- Turn 35: Move left to (4,1) to return to the pot.\n- Turn 36: Change orientation down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- Turn 37: Interact to add the onion to the pot. Pot now has 2 onions; Alice is empty.\n- Turn 38: Change orientation up to face the kitchen counter at (4,2) (where Bob places the onion).\n\n### Next Steps (beyond turn 38):\n- Turn 39: Interact to pick up the onion from (4,2) (placed by Bob).\n- Turn 40: Change orientation down to face the pot.\n- Turn 41: Interact to add the onion to the pot. Cooking starts (finishes turn 46).\n- Alice can then move to get a plate from (0,2) or assist with delivery.\n\nThis plan leverages Bob's position to place an onion nearby, minimizing movement and starting cooking quickly. Total reward is maximized by efficient ingredient collection and role assignment.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: L \\\\\nTurn 30: D \\\\\nTurn 31: I \\\\\nTurn 32: R \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: I \\\\\nTurn 35: L \\\\\nTurn 36: D \\\\\nTurn 37: I \\\\\nTurn 38: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 34. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes. The only recipe we have is Recipe 1: 3 onions, which cooks in 5 turns and gives 20 reward.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (5,1), facing left, holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (5,3), facing up, holding nothing.\n\nImportant objects:\n- Onion dispensers: at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: at (0,2)\n- Pots: at (3,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter: at (7,2)\n- Kitchen counters with onions: (5,2), (5,0), (5,4) each have an onion.\n\nNote: There are onions already on some kitchen counters. We can use these to avoid going to the dispenser every time.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to make a soup with 3 onions. We have two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). Both are empty.\n\nSince we have onions available on counters at (5,0), (5,2), (5,4), we can pick them up and put them into a pot.\n\nHowever, note the positions:\n- Alice is at (5,1). She can move to (5,0) (down) to pick up the onion there? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter with an onion. But to pick up, she must be adjacent and facing it. Currently, she is at (5,1) facing left. So she is not facing (5,0) and not adjacent in the direction she is facing? Adjacent to (5,1) are (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2). But she is facing left, so (4,1). So she cannot interact with (5,0) without moving and changing orientation.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice and Bob work together to fill a pot quickly.\n\nOption: Use the onions on the counters to fill a pot.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Alice is at (5,1). She can move down to (5,0). Then, since (5,0) is a kitchen counter with an onion, she can pick it up by interacting (if she faces it). But note: when she moves down to (5,0), she will be standing on (5,0) which is a kitchen counter. However, the rules say: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" So she cannot interact with the counter she is standing on? Actually, she is standing on the tile (5,0) and that tile is non-empty (it has an onion). But the rule says she must stand on an empty tile adjacent to the non-empty tile. So she cannot pick up the onion while standing on (5,0). She must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face (5,0).\n\nTherefore, to pick up the onion from (5,0), she must be on an adjacent empty tile (like (4,0), (5,1), (6,0)) and facing (5,0). But (4,0) is a pot, (6,0) is a kitchen counter? Actually, the grid: (5,0) is a kitchen counter. Adjacent tiles: (4,0) is a pot, (6,0) is a kitchen counter, (5,1) is empty? Actually, the tile types: (5,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it's empty. So Alice can stand at (5,1) and face down (D) to interact with (5,0). Similarly, (4,0) is a pot, so if she stands at (4,0) she would be on a pot, which is non-empty? But the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So she cannot walk onto (4,0) because it's a pot? Actually, the pot is a non-empty tile? But the pot is empty (no ingredients yet). The rule says non-empty tile meaning it's a dispenser, pot, etc.? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters? Actually, the grid has tile types, and only empty tiles are walkable. So Alice cannot walk onto (4,0) because it's a pot (non-empty). Similarly, (6,0) is a kitchen counter, so she cannot walk there.\n\nTherefore, the only adjacent empty tile to (5,0) is (5,1). So Alice must be at (5,1) and face down (D) to interact with (5,0).\n\nSimilarly, for (5,2): it is adjacent to (5,1) and (5,3). (5,1) and (5,3) are empty? (5,1) is empty, (5,3) is where Bob is? But Bob is at (5,3), so (5,3) is occupied by Bob? So Alice cannot stand at (5,3) because Bob is there. So for (5,2), Alice can stand at (5,1) and face up (U) to interact? Because (5,2) is above (5,1). But note: (5,2) is a kitchen counter, and it has an onion. So to pick up the onion at (5,2), Alice must be at (5,1) and face up? But she is currently at (5,1) and facing left. So she can change orientation to up and then interact.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,4): it is adjacent to (5,3) and (5,5) [if exists?] and (4,4) [onion dispenser?] and (6,4). But (5,3) is occupied by Bob. So Bob could potentially pick up the onion at (5,4) if he moves appropriately.\n\nLet's plan:\n\nWe have two players and we want to fill a pot (either (3,0) or (4,0)) with 3 onions.\n\nWe have onions at:\n- (5,0): kitchen counter\n- (5,2): kitchen counter\n- (5,4): kitchen counter\n\nWe can assign Alice to pick up the onion at (5,0) and (5,2) and then put them in a pot, and Bob to pick up the onion at (5,4) and then put it in the same pot.\n\nBut note: Alice is at (5,1) and Bob at (5,3). \n\nFirst, Alice can pick up the onion at (5,0) and (5,2) without moving far. Bob can pick up the onion at (5,4).\n\nSteps for Alice at (5,1):\n- To pick up from (5,0): she must face down and interact. Currently facing left. So she can change orientation to down (action: D) and then interact (I). But note: changing orientation to down: the action D would normally be move down, but the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" So to change orientation to down without moving, we use the orientation change? Actually, the actions are: Move (L/R/U/D) and Change Orientation (L/R/U/D). How do we specify? The actions are: U, D, L, R for moving, but also for changing orientation? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But in the action set, it's the same symbols? How do we differentiate? \n\nLooking back: \n- \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" \n- \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut in the action list, it's the same set: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how is it decided? \n\nThe rule: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This implies that if you try to move and the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move but change orientation? Or is there a separate action for changing orientation? \n\nActually, the rule says: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can: \n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1). \n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut in the action set, it's the same symbols. So we must interpret: \n- If the player uses U, D, L, R, then if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, they move and change orientation to that direction. If not, they only change orientation to that direction? \n\nThat makes sense. So the action 'D' (for down) means: \n- If the tile below is empty, move down and face down. \n- If the tile below is not empty, then only change orientation to down without moving.\n\nTherefore, for Alice at (5,1) facing left, if she does 'D' (down): \n- The tile below (5,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty), so she doesn't move, but changes orientation to down.\n\nThen, she can do 'I' to interact with (5,0) (which is below her and she is facing down). That will pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, after that, she can change orientation to up (action U) to face up (without moving because above is (5,2) which is non-empty? (5,2) is a kitchen counter, so non-empty. So action U will only change orientation to up without moving. Then she can interact to pick up the onion at (5,2).\n\nBut wait: after she picks up the onion at (5,0), she is holding an onion. Then she cannot pick up the onion at (5,2) because she is holding an item. She must first put the onion somewhere? Or take it to a pot.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\n1. At (5,1): change orientation to down (action D) -> now facing down, still at (5,1).\n2. Interact (I) to pick up onion from (5,0). Now holding an onion.\n3. Then, she must go to a pot to put the onion. The nearest pot is at (3,0) or (4,0). But to go to (3,0) or (4,0), she must move left. From (5,1), she can move left to (4,1). (4,1) is empty? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we know the non-empty ones. (4,1) is not listed as non-empty, so it's empty. Then from (4,1), she can interact with the pot at (4,0) if she faces down? But (4,0) is below (4,1). So she can move down from (4,1) to (4,0)? But (4,0) is a pot, non-empty, so she cannot walk there. So she must stand at (4,1) and face down to interact with (4,0). \n\nSo:\n3. From (5,1) holding onion, move left to (4,1) [action L]. Now at (4,1) facing left? Because when she moves left, she changes orientation to left? The move action changes orientation to the direction of movement. So after moving left, she is at (4,1) facing left. Then she must change orientation to down. But she can do: action D to change to down? Since below (4,0) is non-empty, so action D will change orientation to down without moving. Then interact to put the onion into the pot at (4,0).\n\nAlternatively, she could have moved down from (5,1) but cannot because (5,0) is non-empty. So she must go via (4,1).\n\nSo steps for Alice for the first onion:\n- t1: D (change orientation to down, at (5,1))\n- t2: I (pick up onion from (5,0), now holding onion)\n- t3: L (move left to (4,1), now facing left)\n- t4: D (change orientation to down, because she cannot move down to (4,0))\n- t5: I (put onion into pot at (4,0))\n\nNow the pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nBut we need two more. Meanwhile, Bob is at (5,3) facing up. He can pick up the onion at (5,4). How?\n- He is at (5,3). To pick up from (5,4), he must be on an adjacent empty tile and face (5,4). Adjacent to (5,4): (4,4) is an onion dispenser (non-empty), (5,3) is where Bob is, (6,4) is a kitchen counter (non-empty), and (5,5) doesn't exist? The grid: we don't have coordinates beyond 0-7? Actually, we don't have the grid size, but from the tile list, we see (0,0) to (7,4). So (5,4) is at the top? So (5,5) doesn't exist. So the only adjacent tile to (5,4) that is empty is (5,3)? But (5,3) is occupied by Bob? So Bob is standing on (5,3) which is an empty tile? (5,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it's empty. But Bob is there. So to interact with (5,4), Bob must be on an empty tile adjacent to (5,4) and facing it. (5,3) is adjacent (below) to (5,4). So if Bob is at (5,3) and facing up, then he can interact with (5,4).\n\nBut currently Bob is facing up? Yes, his orientation is U. So he can simply do 'I' to pick up the onion at (5,4)? But note: the rule says he must be standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and facing it. (5,3) is empty? Yes, because it's not listed as a non-empty tile. And (5,4) is adjacent and above, and he is facing up. So he can interact.\n\nSo Bob can:\n- At turn 34, Bob does I: picks up the onion from (5,4). Now Bob is holding an onion.\n\nThen, Bob must take it to a pot. He can go to (4,0) or (3,0). From (5,3) to (4,0): he can move left to (4,3) [if empty], then down to (4,2)? (4,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty), so he cannot go there. Alternatively, move down? From (5,3) down to (5,2) but (5,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot. So he must go via (4,3) and then (4,2) is non-empty, so he cannot go down from (4,3) to (4,2). Alternatively, go left to (4,3), then left again to (3,3) [if empty], then down to (3,2) [kitchen counter? (3,2) is listed as kitchen counter -> non-empty, so cannot walk]. Then down to (3,1) [if empty], then left? This is messy.\n\nAlternatively, he can go to (5,2) but cannot because it's non-empty. Or use the other pot? The pot at (3,0) is available. But how to get there? From (5,3), he can move left to (4,3) [if empty], then down? But (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked by kitchen counter. So he must go around? \n\nNote: the grid might have more empty tiles. We don't have a full grid map, but we can assume the unlisted tiles are empty. So let's list the coordinates we know:\n\nRows: y=0 to y=4? Columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWe know non-empty tiles (kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, serving counter). So any tile not in that list is empty.\n\nSo for Bob at (5,3): \n- He can move left to (4,3): (4,3) is not listed, so empty. Then from (4,3), he can move down? (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so cannot. Then he can move left to (3,3): not listed, empty. Then from (3,3) move down to (3,2): but (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot. Then from (3,3) move left? to (2,3): not listed, empty. Then down to (2,2): (2,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So he cannot go down.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,3) he can move up? But above is (5,4) which is non-empty? (5,4) is a kitchen counter, so he cannot move up. So the only move is left to (4,3). Then from (4,3) he can move up? (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, so cannot. Or down? blocked. So he is stuck at (4,3)? \n\nBut we need to deliver the onion to a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). He can go to (4,1) and then face down to interact with (4,0). How to get to (4,1)? From (4,3) he can move down? But (4,2) is non-empty. So he must go left to (3,3) and then down to (3,2) is blocked, so then left to (2,3) and then down to (2,2) blocked. This is not working.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,3) he can move right? to (6,3). (6,3) is not listed, so empty. Then down to (6,2): (6,2) is not listed? The kitchen counters: (0,0) to ... (7,4). We have kitchen counter at (6,0) and (6,4) but not (6,2). So (6,2) is empty? Then from (6,2) he can move down to (6,1): not listed, empty. Then left to (5,1): but Alice might be there? We have to coordinate.\n\nBut note: Alice is going to (4,1) in her plan. So at turn 34, Alice is at (5,1). Then at turn 35 (if we start at 34) she does D (orientation down), turn 36 I (pick up), turn 37 L to (4,1). So at turn 37, Alice is at (4,1). Then Bob at turn 34: he is at (5,3). If at turn 34 Bob does I (pick up onion from (5,4)), then at turn 35 Bob can move right to (6,3) [action R]. Then turn 36: move down to (6,2) [D]. Then turn 37: move down to (6,1) [D]. Then turn 38: move left to (5,1) but at turn 37 Alice is at (4,1), so (5,1) is empty? Then at turn 38 Bob moves to (5,1). Then at (5,1) he can face down? But (5,0) is kitchen counter, so he cannot put the onion in a pot from (5,1) because the pot is at (4,0) or (3,0). He would need to go to (4,1) but Alice is there? At turn 37 Alice is at (4,1) and she will be there until turn 38? \n\nLet me assign actions per turn starting at t=34.\n\nTurn 34:\n- Alice: D (change orientation to down at (5,1))\n- Bob: I (pick up onion from (5,4) at (5,3))\n\nTurn 35:\n- Alice: I (pick up onion from (5,0) at (5,1) facing down) -> now holding onion.\n- Bob: R (move right to (6,3)) -> now at (6,3) facing right.\n\nTurn 36:\n- Alice: L (move left to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1) facing left.\n- Bob: D (move down to (6,2)) -> now at (6,2) facing down.\n\nTurn 37:\n- Alice: D (change orientation to down at (4,1) because she cannot move down to (4,0)) -> now facing down.\n- Bob: D (move down to (6,1)) -> now at (6,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: I (put onion into pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has one onion (from Alice) and Alice is holding nothing.\n- Bob: L (move left to (5,1)) -> now at (5,1) facing left.\n\nNow Bob is at (5,1) holding an onion. He needs to put it in a pot. He can go to (4,1) but Alice is there at turn 38? At turn 38, Alice is at (4,1) and does I, so she remains at (4,1). Then Bob at (5,1) can move left to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by Alice? So he cannot. He must go to the other pot? Or wait.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (3,0) pot. From (5,1) he can move left to (4,1) but blocked by Alice. So he can move up? From (5,1) move up to (5,2) but (5,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) -> cannot. So he must change orientation and interact? But to interact with a pot, he must be adjacent and facing it. The nearest pot is (4,0) but he is at (5,1) which is adjacent to (4,0)? (5,1) is adjacent to (4,1), (5,0), (5,2), (6,1) but not (4,0). So he cannot interact with (4,0) from (5,1). He must be at (4,1) or (3,0) or (5,0) or (4,0) but none of these are accessible? (4,1) is occupied by Alice.\n\nSo at turn 38, after Alice puts the onion, she can move away to let Bob use (4,1). For example, Alice can move up to (4,2) but (4,2) is non-empty? (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot. Or move right to (5,1) but Bob is coming to (5,1) at turn 38. So conflict.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob go to the other pot at (3,0). From (5,1) Bob can move left to (4,1) is blocked, so he must go around: from (5,1) move up? blocked. Or move down? (5,0) non-empty. So only right? to (6,1). Then from (6,1) he can move up? to (6,2) [but at turn 37 he was at (6,1), then turn 38 he moves to (5,1) -> no, at turn 38 Bob is moving to (5,1). Then at turn 39, Bob can move right to (6,1) again? Then from (6,1) move down? to (6,0) but (6,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. Or move left to (5,1) again. This is stuck.\n\nBetter: after Alice puts the onion at turn 38, she moves away from (4,1) to let Bob in. At turn 38:\n- Alice at (4,1) does I (put onion in pot) and then she is free. Then at turn 39, Alice can move right to (5,1). But Bob is at (5,1) at turn 38? So at turn 39, Bob is at (5,1) and Alice is at (4,1). Then at turn 39, Alice moves right to (5,1) but Bob is there -> conflict. So they cannot both be at (5,1).\n\nSo at turn 39, Alice can stay? Or move in a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, after turn 38, Alice moves up? But (4,2) is non-empty. Or move down? cannot. Or move left? to (3,1). (3,1) is not listed, so empty. So Alice can move left to (3,1). Then Bob can move to (4,1) and then face down to put the onion in (4,0).\n\nSo:\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now empty, pot has one onion.\n- Bob: L (trying to move left to (4,1) from (5,1)) -> but (4,1) is occupied by Alice? So Bob cannot move. This is a problem.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid having Bob at (5,1) when Alice is at (4,1). Instead, we can have Bob go to the other pot (3,0). How?\n\nFrom Bob at (5,1) at turn 38, he can move left to (4,1) is blocked, so he moves up? blocked. So he moves right to (6,1). Then from (6,1) move up to (6,2). Then left to (5,2) -> blocked. Then up? not helpful. Or from (6,1) move left to (5,1) is back. Or down? blocked.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (3,0) via (3,1). But how to get to (3,1)? From (5,1) -> (4,1) is blocked, so he must go around: (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (5,2) blocked -> (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) blocked. This is not working.\n\nBetter: after Alice has put the onion at turn 38, she moves away immediately to (3,1) or (5,1) but Bob is coming to (5,1). So at turn 38:\n- Alice: after putting the onion, she can move right to (5,1) at turn 39. But at turn 38, Bob is at (5,1) and wants to move to (4,1). But Alice is still at (4,1) until the end of turn 38. Then at turn 39, Alice moves to (5,1), freeing (4,1). But Bob is at (5,1) at turn 38, so at turn 39 when Alice moves to (5,1), there is conflict.\n\nWe need to sequence differently.\n\nAlternative plan: use the onion at (5,2) for the second onion.\n\nAt turn 34, instead of Bob picking up the onion at (5,4), we have Alice pick up two onions: first (5,0), then (5,2), and then Bob picks up (5,4) and also brings it.\n\nBut Alice can pick up (5,2) after putting the first onion? Let's see.\n\nAlice at turn 34: D (face down)\n35: I (pick up (5,0))\n36: L (move to (4,1))\n37: D (face down)\n38: I (put in pot at (4,0)) -> now empty\n39: U (face up, because she is at (4,1) and above is (4,2) non-empty, so only change orientation to up)\n40: I (pick up onion from (5,2)? But (5,2) is at (5,2) which is not adjacent to (4,1). (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0), (4,2), (3,1), (5,1). Not (5,2). So she cannot interact with (5,2) from (4,1). She must move to (5,1) and face up.\n\nSo after turn 38, Alice is at (4,1) facing down? After interacting, she remains facing down. Then she can move right to (5,1) at turn 39. Then at turn 40, face up (U) without moving because (5,2) is non-empty. Then interact to pick up onion from (5,2) at turn 41.\n\nThen she is holding an onion and must put it in the pot. She can go back to (4,1) and face down to put in (4,0).\n\nSo:\n39: Alice moves right to (5,1)\n40: Alice changes orientation to up (U) -> faces up\n41: Alice interacts to pick up onion from (5,2) -> holding onion\n42: Alice moves left to (4,1)\n43: Alice changes orientation to down (D) -> faces down\n44: Alice interacts to put onion in pot at (4,0) -> now pot has two onions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be picking up the onion at (5,4) and bringing it to the pot. But he must avoid conflicts.\n\nBob at turn 34: I (pick up onion from (5,4))\n35: move right to (6,3)\n36: move down to (6,2)\n37: move down to (6,1)\n38: move left to (5,1) -> but at turn 38, Alice is at (4,1) and Bob at (5,1) is okay.\n39: at turn 39, Alice is moving to (5,1) from (4,1)? But Bob is at (5,1) at turn 38. So at turn 39, when Alice moves to (5,1), conflict.\n\nSo at turn 39, Bob must move away from (5,1). For example, Bob at turn 38 is at (5,1) holding onion. Then at turn 39, he can move left to (4,1) but Alice is moving to (5,1) at turn 39, so (4,1) is free? Alice is at (4,1) until turn 39 action: she moves to (5,1). So during turn 39, Alice moves from (4,1) to (5,1), and Bob moves from (5,1) to (4,1). But they swap positions? Is that allowed? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" But if they swap, do they pass through each other? Typically in such games, swapping is allowed if they move simultaneously. But the rules don't specify. To be safe, let's avoid.\n\nBob at turn 38 is at (5,1). He can stay at turn 39? Then at turn 39, Alice moves to (5,1) -> conflict.\n\nSo Bob should not go to (5,1) at turn 38. Instead, after picking up the onion at turn 34, Bob can wait or go a different route.\n\nBob's route to (4,0) without going to (5,1):\n- He is at (5,3) at turn 34. After turn 34: he has picked up onion.\n- Turn 35: move left to (4,3)\n- Turn 36: move left to (3,3)\n- Turn 37: move down? (3,2) is non-empty, cannot. So move left to (2,3)\n- Turn 38: move down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is kitchen counter, non-empty, cannot. So stuck.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nAlternative: use the pot at (3,0) for Bob. But it's symmetric.\n\nPerhaps have both players use the same pot and coordinate the use of (4,1).\n\nAt turn 38:\n- Alice at (4,1) puts onion in pot (I), then at turn 39 she moves to (3,1) (left) to free (4,1) for Bob.\n- Bob at turn 38 is at (5,1) (from earlier movement) and cannot move to (4,1) because Alice is there. So he waits at turn 38 with action S (stay). Then at turn 39, Alice moves to (3,1), freeing (4,1). Then Bob can move to (4,1) at turn 39. Then at turn 40, Bob faces down (D) and interacts to put onion in pot.\n\nThen the pot has two onions (one from Alice, one from Bob). Then we need a third onion.\n\nAlice, after moving to (3,1) at turn 39, can then go to pick up the onion at (5,2) or (5,4). But (5,2) is closer.\n\nFrom (3,1) at turn 39:\n- Turn 40: move right to (4,1) -> but at turn 40, Bob is at (4,1) and doing D (change orientation) or about to interact. So conflict.\n\nSo Alice should not go to (4,1). From (3,1) she can move up? (3,2) is non-empty, cannot. Move down? (3,0) is a pot, non-empty, cannot. So she can move right to (4,1) only if it's free, but it's occupied by Bob at turn 39.\n\nSo she can stay at (3,1) or move to (3,0) but cannot.\n\nPerhaps after putting the first onion, Alice goes to pick up the onion at (5,2) by going to (5,1) and then facing up, but then she blocks Bob.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to have only one player fill the pot.\n\nAlice can do all three onions? But she can carry only one at a time.\n\nAlice:\n- Pick up onion at (5,0): turns 34-35: D, I\n- Put in pot at (4,0): turns 36-38: L, D, I (as before)\n- Then at turn 39: move right to (5,1)\n- Turn 40: face up (U) \n- Turn 41: interact to pick up onion at (5,2)\n- Turn 42: move left to (4,1)\n- Turn 43: face down (D)\n- Turn 44: interact to put onion in pot (now two onions)\n- Then she needs to get the third onion. The only one left is at (5,4). She can go to (5,3) and face up to interact with (5,4).\n\nFrom (4,1) after turn 44, she is holding nothing.\n- Turn 45: move right to (5,1)\n- Turn 46: move down? (5,0) non-empty, so move up? (5,2) non-empty. So move to (5,1) is already there. Then move right to (6,1) if needed, but to get to (5,4), she needs to go via (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,1):\n- Turn 45: move up to (5,2) -> cannot, non-empty.\n- So she must move to (5,3): from (5,1) move up is blocked, so move right to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (5,2) blocked. So she can move down? blocked. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,1) move to (5,0) but cannot. So the only way is through (5,3). From (5,1) she can move down? no. So move right to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then left to (5,3). (5,3) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 45: Alice move right to (6,1)\n- Turn 46: Alice move up to (6,2)\n- Turn 47: Alice move up to (6,3)\n- Turn 48: Alice move left to (5,3) -> now at (5,3)\n- Turn 49: face up (U) (since (5,4) above is non-empty, so only change orientation)\n- Turn 50: interact to pick up onion from (5,4)\n- Then she must go back to the pot. From (5,3) to (4,0): move left to (4,3), then down? blocked. So go to (4,1) and face down.\n\nFrom (5,3):\n- Turn 51: move left to (4,3)\n- Turn 52: move down? (4,2) non-empty, cannot. So move left to (3,3)\n- Turn 53: move down to (3,2) blocked. This is taking too long.\n\nIt's inefficient.\n\nBob can help with the third onion. But we are at turn 34, and we want to deliver the soup as soon as possible.\n\nAnother idea: use the onion on (5,4) first with Bob, but have him put it in the pot at (3,0) to avoid conflict with Alice at (4,0).\n\nFor (3,0), how to access? Players must stand at (3,1) and face down.\n\n (3,1) is empty.\n\nBob's journey to (3,0):\n- At (5,3) holding onion (after turn 34: I)\n- Turn 35: move left to (4,3)\n- Turn 36: move left to (3,3)\n- Turn 37: move down? (3,2) non-empty, cannot. So move down is not possible.\n- The only way is to go to (3,1) but how? From (3,3) move left to (2,3), then down to (2,2) blocked. So not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only accessible pot is (4,0) using (4,1) as the interaction tile.\n\nWe must coordinate the use of (4,1).\n\nPlan for Alice and Bob:\n\nAlice focuses on the onions at (5,0) and (5,2), and Bob on (5,4).\n\nAlice:\n- Turn 34: D (face down at (5,1))\n- Turn 35: I (pick up from (5,0))\n- Turn 36: L (move to (4,1))\n- Turn 37: D (face down)\n- Turn 38: I (put in pot at (4,0)) -> pot has 1 onion, Alice empty at (4,1)\n- Turn 39: move right to (5,1) ( freeing (4,1))\n\nBob:\n- Turn 34: I (pick up from (5,4)) -> at (5,3) facing up, now holding onion\n- Turn 35: S (stay) or move to (6,3)? But let's wait for Alice to free (4,1). \n- Turn 36: S\n- Turn 37: S\n- Turn 38: S (still at (5,3) holding onion)\n- Turn 39: move left to (4,3) (action L) -> now at (4,3) facing left\n- Turn 40: move down? (4,2) non-empty, cannot. So move left to (3,3) (action L) -> at (3,3) facing left\n- Turn 41: move down? (3,2) non-empty, cannot. So he is stuck.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nPerhaps after Alice frees (4,1) at turn 39, Bob can go directly to (4,1) from (5,3) via (5,2) but cannot. Or via (5,1) and then left.\n\nBob at (5,3) at turn 38. At turn 39, Alice moves from (4,1) to (5,1), so (4,1) is free. then Bob can move left from (5,3) to (4,3) at turn 39. Then at turn 40, move down from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. So no.\n\nI think the only way is for Bob to use (5,1) after Alice has moved away.\n\nAfter Alice has picked up the onion at (5,2) and is at (5,1) (after turn 39 in the earlier plan), then Bob can use (4,1) to put his onion.\n\nLet's timeline:\n\nTurn 34:\n- Alice: D\n- Bob: I ( picks up onion at (5,4) )\n\nTurn 35:\n- Alice: I ( picks up onion from (5,0) )\n- Bob: R (move to (6,3))\n\nTurn 36:\n- Alice: L ( to (4,1) )\n- Bob: D ( to (6,2) )\n\nTurn 37:\n- Alice: D ( face down )\n- Bob: D ( to (6,1) )\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: I ( put in pot at (4,0) ) -> pot has 1, Alice empty\n- Bob: L ( to (5,1) ) -> now at (5,1) holding onion\n\nTurn 39:\n- Alice: R ( move to (5,1) ) -> but Bob is there! Conflict.\n\nSo at turn 38, after Alice puts the onion, she can move left to (3,1) instead of right.\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: I ( put onion ) then move left to (3,1) ( action L? But she is at (4,1) and move left to (3,1) -> action L. She can because (3,1) is empty.\n- Bob: L ( to (5,1) ) -> no conflict because Alice is moving to (3,1).\n\nSo turn 38 actions:\n- Alice: I ( interact to put onion, then since it's the same turn? The action is atomic. After interact, she is still at (4,1) facing down. Then she does L to move left to (3,1). But can she do two actions in one turn? No, each turn one action.\n\n So in one turn, she can either interact or move. So at turn 38, she does I (put onion), and that's it. She remains at (4,1). Then at turn 39, she can move left to (3,1).\n\n Then turn 39:\n- Alice: L ( move to (3,1) )\n- Bob: L ( move to (5,1) ) -> from (6,1)? At turn 38, Bob is at (6,1) and does L to (5,1). So at turn 39, Alice is moving from (4,1) to (3,1), and Bob is moving from (6,1) to (5,1) -> no conflict.\n\nThen turn 40:\n- Alice is at (3,1) and can face down to interact with the pot at (3,0)? But that pot is empty. She is not holding anything.\n- Bob is at (5,1) holding onion. He can move left to (4,1) ( action L ) -> now at (4,1) facing left.\n\nTurn 41:\n- Alice: can she do anything? She might go to pick up another onion.\n- Bob: at (4,1) he can face down ( action D ) because (4,0) is below.\n\nTurn 42:\n- Alice: ...\n- Bob: I ( put onion in pot at (4,0) ) -> now the pot has two onions.\n\nThen we need one more onion.\n\nAlice can now pick up the onion at (5,2):\n- She is at (3,1) at turn 40.\n- Turn 41: move right to (4,1) -> but at turn 41, Bob is at (4,1) doing D (orientation)? turn 41: Bob does D (change to down) at (4,1), so he is still there. So Alice cannot move to (4,1) at turn 41.\n- Turn 41: Alice move right to (4,1) is blocked, so she can move down? (3,0) non-empty, cannot. So only move up? (3,2) non-empty, cannot. So she must wait or move right in a different way. \n- Turn 41: Alice can move up? blocked. So she does S (stay).\n\nTurn 42: \n- Bob: I ( put onion in pot) -> now pot has two onions, Bob empty.\n- Alice: can now move right to (4,1) -> but at turn 42, Bob is at (4,1) and is doing I, so after I, he is still there. Then Alice cannot move to (4,1) at turn 42.\n\nTurn 43:\n- Bob can move away from (4,1) to let Alice. For example, move right to (5,1) (action R).\n- Alice move right to (4,1) (action R) -> conflict if in the same turn.\n\nSo at turn 43:\n- Bob: R ( move to (5,1) )\n- Alice: R ( move to (4,1) ) -> no conflict because they are moving to different tiles.\n\nThen Alice at (4,1) at turn 43.\nTurn 44: Alice move right to (5,1)? or face up to interact with (5,2)? But she needs to face up and be at (5,1) to interact with (5,2).\n\nSo:\nTurn 44: Alice move to (5,1) (action R) -> from (4,1) to (5,1)\nTurn 45: Alice face up (U) -> because (5,2) above is non-empty, so only orientation change.\nTurn 46: Alice interact to pick up onion from (5,2)\nTurn 47: Alice move left to (4,1)\nTurn 48: Alice face down (D)\nTurn 49: Alice interact to put onion in pot -> now the pot has three onions. The soup starts cooking.\n\nThe cooking time is 5 turns, so after 5 turns, the soup is ready.\n\nThen someone must get a plate, put it in the soup, and deliver.\n\nBut we are only planning for H turns. How many turns do we want to plan? Until the soup is delivered? But that would be many turns. The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns (say, H turns)\". So we can choose H.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we might want to complete one soup as fast as possible.\n\nAt turn 49, the pot at (4,0) has three onions and starts cooking. It will be ready at turn 49 + 5 = turn 54.\n\nThen at turn 54, a player can serve the soup: they need to have a clean plate, interact with the pot to get the soup, then take it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nBut we are at turn 34, and we are planning for say 20 turns? Or until the soup is delivered.\n\nBut the task doesn't specify H, so we can plan until the soup is delivered or for a fixed H.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's plan for Alice until she has placed the second onion, and then we can see.\n\nBut to have a complete plan, let's assume we want to get the soup cooking as fast as possible.\n\nSo far, we have a plan until turn 49 for the third onion to be put in the pot. But in the above, at turn 49, Alice puts the third onion.\n\nBut in the above timeline, we have:\n\n- Turn 34: Alice D, Bob I\n- Turn 35: Alice I, Bob R\n- Turn 36: Alice L, Bob D\n- Turn 37: Alice D, Bob D\n- Turn 38: Alice I, Bob L ( to (5,1) )  [Bob from (6,1) to (5,1)]\n- Turn 39: Alice L ( to (3,1) ), Bob S? or what? At turn 38, Bob moved to (5,1). At turn 39, Alice moves to (3,1), so Bob can stay or move. But in the earlier, at turn 39, Bob is at (5,1) and should move to (4,1) at some point.\n\nLet's restart from turn 38 onward.\n\nAt turn 38:\n- Alice at (4,1) does I: puts onion in pot, now empty, pot has 1 onion.\n- Bob at (6,1) does L: moves to (5,1), holding onion.\n\nTurn 39:\n- Alice: L ( moves to (3,1) ) -> now at (3,1)\n- Bob: S ( stay at (5,1) )  // waiting for Alice to free (4,1) is not necessary yet, but he can start moving to (4,1) only if it's free. At turn 39, (4,1) is free because Alice left to (3,1).\n\nTurn 39:\n- Alice: L to (3,1)\n- Bob: L from (5,1) to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing left.\n\nTurn 40:\n- Alice: at (3,1), not holding anything. She can try to help with the third onion, but let's have her stay or prepare for the plate.\n- Bob: at (4,1) holding onion. He can face down ( action D ) to interact with the pot.\n\nTurn 41:\n- Alice: S or move\n- Bob: I ( put onion in pot) -> now pot has 2 onions. Bob is empty.\n\nTurn 42: \n- Alice: can go to pick up the onion at (5,2). She is at (3,1). To do that, she must go to (5,1) and face up.\n- Turn 42: Alice move right to (4,1) -> but at (4,1) is Bob at turn 41? At turn 41, Bob is at (4,1) and does I, so he remains. So at turn 42, Alice cannot move to (4,1) because Bob is there.\n\nTurn 42:\n- Bob: after putting onion, he can move away. For example, move right to (5,1) (action R).\n- Alice: move right to (4,1) -> conflict if same turn.\n\nTurn 42:\n- Bob: R ( move to (5,1) )\n- Alice: R ( move to (4,1) ) -> no conflict.\n\nThen turn 43: Alice is at (4,1), Bob at (5,1).\n\nTurn 43: Alice move right to (5,1) -> conflict with Bob.\n\nSo at turn 43, Alice can move right to (5,1) only if Bob moves away.\n\nTurn 43:\n- Bob: move up? (5,2) non-empty, cannot. So move right to (6,1) (action R).\n- Alice: move right to (5,1) (action R) -> from (4,1) to (5,1), no conflict.\n\nThen turn 44: Alice at (5,1), she can face up (U) (action U) because (5,2) is above.\nTurn 45: Alice I ( pick up onion from (5,2) )\nTurn 46: Alice move left to (4,1) (action L)\nTurn 47: Alice face down (D) (action D)\nTurn 48: Alice I ( put onion in pot) -> now the pot has three onions at turn 48. The soup starts cooking at turn 48.\n\nThen it will be ready at turn 48 + 5 = turn 53.\n\nNow, we need to deliver the soup. This requires:\n1. Someone to get a plate from the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n2. Use the plate on the pot at (4,0) to get the soup.\n3. Deliver the soup to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nAlice is at (4,1) after turn 48, holding nothing.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). It's far.\n\nBob is at (6,1) at turn 48.\n\nWe can assign Alice or Bob to get the plate.\n\nThe shortest path for Alice to (0,2): \n (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) [assume empty] -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> then face up to interact with (0,2)? But (0,1) is empty? (0,1) is listed as kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (0,1), so non-empty, so she cannot walk there. The list: kitchen counter at (0,1), so she cannot walk on (0,1). So she must use (0,0) or (0,2) but (0,2) is the dispenser, non-empty.\n\nTo access the plate dispenser at (0,2), she must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face it. Adjacent tiles: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), (-1,2) [invalid]. (0,1) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (0,3) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (1,2) is empty? (1,2) is not listed as non-empty, so empty. So she can stand at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nHow to get to (1,2) from (4,1)? \n- (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> but (1,1) is not listed, so empty. Then from (1,1) move up to (1,2) [empty].\n\nThen at (1,2) face left ( action L) then interact.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nSince the soup will be ready at turn 53, we can start getting the plate before that.\n\nBut we are at turn 48, and we need to plan for several turns. Let's assume H=20, so until turn 54.\n\nBut to have the soup delivered, we need to get the plate before turn 53.\n\nLet's have Alice get the plate.\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 48:\n- Turn 49: move left to (3,1)\n- Turn 50: move left to (2,1) [assume empty]\n- Turn 51: move left to (1,1) [empty]\n- Turn 52: move up to (1,2) [empty]\n- Turn 53: face left (L) ( to face the dispenser at (0,2) )\n- Turn 54: interact to pick up plate.\n\nThen she is holding a plate. She must take it to the pot at (4,0) to get the soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,0):\n- Turn 55: move right to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot. So move down to (1,1) [action D]\n- Turn 56: move right to (2,1)\n- Turn 57: move right to (3,1)\n- Turn 58: move right to (4,1)\n- Turn 59: face down (D)\n- Turn 60: interact with pot to get soup.\n\nThen take the soup to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) holding soup:\n- Turn 61: move right to (5,1)\n- Turn 62: move up to (5,2) blocked, so move right to (6,1)\n- Turn 63: move up to (6,2)\n- Turn 64: move up to (6,3)\n- Turn 65: move left to (5,3) or right to (7,2)? (7,2) is serving counter. From (6,2) to (7,2): move right to (7,2) but (7,2) is non-empty, so cannot walk. So must stand at (6,2) or (7,1) or (7,3) and face (7,2).\n\n (7,1) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (7,3) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (6,2) is empty. So stand at (6,2) and face right to interact with (7,2).\n\nSo:\n- Turn 65: from (6,2) face right (R) \n- Turn 66: interact to deliver.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nBob might be closer to the plate dispenser at turn 48. Bob is at (6,1) at turn 48.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (1,2):\n- (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) \n- 6 steps, then face left and interact.\n\nSo turn 49: move left to (5,1)\n turn 50: left to (4,1)\n turn 51: left to (3,1)\n turn 52: left to (2,1)\n turn 53: left to (1,1)\n turn 54: up to (1,2)\n turn 55: face left (L)\n turn 56: interact to get plate.\n\nThen from (1,2) to the pot at (4,0): as above, down to (1,1), right to (2,1), etc., arriving at (4,1) at turn 59, then face down and interact at turn 60.\n\nThen to deliver: from (4,1) to (6,2) as before, arriving at turn 65, deliver at turn 66.\n\nThe soup is ready at turn 53, but we get the plate at turn 56 at the earliest, so the soup is not taken immediately, but that's okay.\n\nTo optimize, we can have one player get the plate while the soup is cooking.\n\nSince the cooking takes 5 turns, at turn 48 the soup starts, ready at turn 53.\n\nSo at turn 48, Alice is at (4,1) and can immediately go for the plate.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (6,1) and can also go.\n\nBut Alice is closer to the left side.\n\nAlice from (4,1) to (1,2): 4 steps ( left to (3,1), left to (2,1), left to (1,1), up to (1,2) ) -> turns 49-52, then at turn 53: face left and interact at turn 54.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 53, so at turn 54 she has the plate, then she can go to the pot.\n\nAlternatively, she can get the plate before the soup is ready.\n\nAt turn 48: soup starts.\nAlice at turn 48: at (4,1), can move left to (3,1) ( turn 48 action? But turn 48 is when she puts the third onion, so after that, she can move.\n\nIn the plan above, at turn 48: Alice does I to put the third onion, then at turn 49 she starts moving.\n\nSo she can be at (1,2) at turn 52, then at turn 53: face left and interact to get plate. Then at turn 53 the soup is ready, so she can then go to the pot.\n\nBut from (1,2) to (4,0): it takes several turns. Minimum: down to (1,1) at turn 54, then right to (2,1) turn 55, right to (3,1) turn 56, right to (4,1) turn 57, then face down and interact at turn 58.\n\nSo the soup is ready at turn 53, but she doesn't get it until turn 58.\n\nDuring this time, the soup doesn't burn, I assume.\n\nThen deliver.\n\nGiven the complexity and that the task might expect only the beginning of the plan, let's output the first few turns for Alice and assume H=10 or so.\n\nBut the task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can plan for Alice only.\n\nIn the answer format, it's for Alice only? The boxed answer has actions for Alice.\n\nThe task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice.\n\nSo we plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will be controlled by someone else.\n\nBut in this case, to maximize reward, we need coordination, but since we only output Alice's actions, we can focus on Alice.\n\nAlice's actions to contribute to the soup.\n\nFrom the initial state, Alice can:\n- Turn 34: D (face down to interact with (5,0))\n- Turn 35: I (pick up onion from (5,0))\n- Turn 36: L (move left to (4,1))\n- Turn 37: D (face down to interact with (4,0))\n- Turn 38: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\n- Then turn 39: move right to (5,1) to access (5,2)\n- Turn 40: U (face up to interact with (5,2))\n- Turn 41: I (pick up onion from (5,2))\n- Turn 42: L (move left to (4,1))\n- Turn 43: D (face down)\n- Turn 44: I ( put onion in pot)\n\nThen the pot has two onions. She can then get the third onion from (5,4) or wait for Bob.\n\nBut for H=10, we can stop at turn 44.\n\nSo actions for Alice from turn 34 to turn 44 (11 actions):\n\nTurn 34: D\nTurn 35: I\nTurn 36: L\nTurn 37: D\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: R\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: L\nTurn 43: D\nTurn 44: I\n\nThen at turn 44, the pot has two onions (from Alice) and we hope Bob has put one or will put one.\n\nBut initially, Bob is not holding anything, and he might not cooperate.\n\nTo be safe, Alice can then get the third onion herself, but it will take more turns.\n\nFor the answer, we can output this sequence.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: D\nTurn 35: I\nTurn 36: L\nTurn 37: D\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: R\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: L\nTurn 43: D\nTurn 44: I\n}\n\nThis puts two onions in the pot. The third onion can be obtained from (5,4) by Alice or by Bob.\n\nAfter turn 44, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can then go to (5,1) and then to (5,3) to get the onion from (5,4), but it will take several turns.\n\nBut for H=10, we stop at turn 44.\n\nWe assume Bob will do his part.\n\nTo be more efficient, we can include more turns, but for the sake of the task, this is a reasonable plan for Alice.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in *Overcooked*, Alice and Bob must coordinate to fill a pot with 3 onions (as per Recipe 1, which yields a reward of 20 after 5 turns of cooking). Given the current game state at turn 34, the plan for Alice focuses on efficiently collecting onions from nearby kitchen counters and depositing them into the pot at (4,0). The available onions are on kitchen counters at (5,0), (5,2), and (5,4). Alice's actions are optimized to minimize movement and leverage her current position (5,1) and orientation (left), while Bob is expected to handle the onion at (5,4) to avoid conflicts and ensure the pot is filled quickly.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 34 to 44)\n- **Turn 34 (D)**: Change orientation to down (to interact with (5,0)).\n- **Turn 35 (I)**: Pick up onion from kitchen counter (5,0) (now holding an onion).\n- **Turn 36 (L)**: Move left to (4,1) (facing left; positions for pot interaction).\n- **Turn 37 (D)**: Change orientation to down (to interact with pot (4,0)).\n- **Turn 38 (I)**: Deposit onion into pot at (4,0) (pot now has 1 onion; Alice empty-handed).\n- **Turn 39 (R)**: Move right to (5,1) (facing right; positioning for (5,2)).\n- **Turn 40 (U)**: Change orientation to up (to interact with (5,2)).\n- **Turn 41 (I)**: Pick up onion from kitchen counter (5,2) (now holding an onion).\n- **Turn 42 (L)**: Move left to (4,1) (facing left; positions for pot interaction).\n- **Turn 43 (D)**: Change orientation to down (to interact with pot (4,0)).\n- **Turn 44 (I)**: Deposit onion into pot at (4,0) (pot now has 2 onions; Alice empty-handed).\n\n### Coordination with Bob\n- **Bob's expected actions**: At turn 34, Bob (at (5,3) holding nothing) should interact (I) to pick up the onion from (5,4). He should then navigate to the pot at (4,0) via (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and (5,1), depositing the onion by turn 41–42 to complete the pot (3 onions). This allows the soup to start cooking by ~turn 44, ready at turn 49.\n- **Conflict avoidance**: Alice moves away from (4,1) after depositing (turn 39) to allow Bob access. After turn 44, Alice can assist with fetching a plate from (0,2) for serving.\n\n### Rationale\n- **Efficiency**: Alice collects the closest onions ((5,0) and (5,2)) with minimal movement. Her path leverages empty tiles ((4,1), (5,1)) and avoids blocking Bob.\n- **Reward maximization**: Filling the pot by turn 44 enables cooking to start immediately. The soup will be ready by turn 49, and with plate delivery, the reward (20) can be claimed shortly after.\n- **Constraints adhered to**: All actions respect movement/orientation rules, item-carrying limits, and tile accessibility. Kitchen counters are used for item storage to reduce trips to dispensers.\n\nThis sequence ensures Alice contributes optimally to the team goal. After turn 44, Alice should fetch a plate from (0,2) while the soup cooks, and Bob can deliver it to (7,2) for the reward.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: D\nTurn 35: I\nTurn 36: L\nTurn 37: D\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: R\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: L\nTurn 43: D\nTurn 44: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 38. The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nKey observations from the game state:\n- Alice is at (6,1), facing down, holding one onion.\n- Bob is at (3,3), facing up, holding one onion.\n- There are two onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). Note: no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n- Serving counter at (7,2).\n- Kitchen counters have two onions: one at (5,2) and one at (5,4).\n\nRecipe: Only one recipe is given: 3 onions, 5 turns cooking time, reward 20.\n\nCurrent non-empty pots: none.\n\nConstraints:\n- Players can carry one item at a time.\n- They cannot walk through each other or non-empty tiles.\n\nWe need to make soup. Since we have only onions, we must make the onion soup. The recipe requires 3 onions.\n\nPlan:\nWe have two players, each holding one onion. We need one more onion and then a plate to serve.\n\nSteps:\n1. We need to get the third onion. There are two ways:\n   - One of the players can pick up one of the onions on the kitchen counters (at (5,2) or (5,4)).\n   - Or, a player can go to an onion dispenser to get another onion.\n\nBut note: both players are holding an onion already, so they cannot pick up another item until they drop or use their current onion.\n\nSo, we must first use the onions we have. The best place is to put them into a pot.\n\nThere are two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). Both are empty.\n\nWe need to get the onions into one pot. Since we have two players, we can use both to speed up.\n\nHowever, note that the pot must have 3 onions to start cooking. So we need to put two more onions into the pot after the first one.\n\nBut we have two players, each holding an onion. They can both put their onions into the same pot? Let me check the rules:\n\n- For the pot: add ingredient (if pot is not full and player is holding ingredient). The pot can hold up to 3 ingredients.\n\nSo, if one player puts an onion, the pot will have 1 onion. Then the other player can put another onion, making it 2. Then we need a third.\n\nBut we have two onions on kitchen counters. We can use one of those.\n\nAlternatively, we can have one player put their onion into the pot, then go to get another onion (from dispenser or counter) and put that too.\n\nBut note: the pot is at (3,0) and (4,0). The kitchen counters with onions are at (5,2) and (5,4). The dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nAlso, the plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nWe need to coordinate.\n\nProposed plan:\n\nWe have two pots. We can use one pot for the soup.\n\nLet's choose the pot at (3,0) for example.\n\nStep 1: Alice and Bob both go to the pot at (3,0) and put their onions.\n\nBut they are at different positions.\n\nAlice is at (6,1) and Bob at (3,3).\n\nAlice: (6,1) -> needs to go to (3,0). That is: left 3 times and down 1 time? But she is at (6,1). To go to (3,0): \n- First, she must go left to (5,1), then (4,1), then (3,1). Then down to (3,0). But (3,1) to (3,0) is down. She is facing down at (6,1). So she can move left? But she is facing down. Remember: to move, the player must change orientation to move? Or can they move in any direction without changing orientation? \n\nThe action: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation. So if she moves left, she will face left and be at (5,1). Then move left again to (4,1) facing left. Then left to (3,1) facing left. Then down to (3,0) facing down.\n\nBut note: the tile at (3,1) is a kitchen counter? Let's see: kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), ... but (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list. The kitchen counters are: \n[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (0, 1), (7, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (0, 3), (7, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]\n\nSo (3,1) is empty? Because it's not in the list. So she can walk there.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3) facing up. He can move down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (3,2) is in the list. So he cannot walk onto (3,2) because it's non-empty? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note: kitchen counters are non-empty only if they have an item? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and in the current state, only (5,2) and (5,4) have onions. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter but currently empty? Because the non-empty ones are specified: (5,2) and (5,4). So (3,2) is empty? Then Bob can walk on it? But the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And a kitchen counter is a tile type. The rule does not say players cannot walk on kitchen counters. It says they are temporary storage. And the movement constraint is: cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So if the kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? \n\nLet me check the tile types:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: is one of the tile types. The movement rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" What does non-empty mean? It means there is an item on that tile? Or the tile itself is an obstacle? \n\nFrom the description: \n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n- Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: these are non-empty tiles? Or are they walkable?\n\nThe problem says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nThis implies that the player must be on an empty tile and adjacent to the target (which is non-empty). So dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are not walkable? Because the player must be adjacent to interact.\n\nAlso, the movement constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are the ones that are not empty. So dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters are non-empty and hence not walkable.\n\nBut wait: the kitchen counter is used for storage, so if it has an item, it's non-empty? Or is the tile itself non-empty? The problem says \"non-empty tile\" in the context of interaction, meaning the tile has something (like a dispenser, pot, etc.) or has an item (for kitchen counter). But for movement, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined by the tile type? Or by whether they are occupied?\n\nLooking at the grid description, it lists tile types. The kitchen counter is a type of tile. The movement rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then lists the types. But the interaction rule distinguishes: the player must be on an empty tile (which is walkable) and adjacent to a non-empty tile (which is one of the interactive objects).\n\nSo, for movement, the only walkable tiles are the empty tiles. All others (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are obstacles and cannot be walked on.\n\nTherefore, (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, so it is not walkable. Bob cannot walk onto (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, so it's non-empty and not walkable.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3) facing up. He cannot move down to (3,2) because (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable). He can move left, right, or up? Let's see the adjacent tiles:\n\n- Up: (3,4) - that is an onion dispenser, non-walkable.\n- Down: (3,2) - kitchen counter, non-walkable.\n- Left: (2,3) - is that empty? The kitchen counters are at (0,3), (7,3) ... (2,3) is not in the kitchen counter list. Also, not a dispenser, pot, or serving counter. So it should be empty? Because the grid has only the listed non-empty tiles. So (2,3) is empty and walkable.\n- Right: (4,3) - similarly, not in any non-empty list? The non-empty tiles are the ones listed: dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters. (4,3) is not in any list? So it's an empty tile.\n\nTherefore, Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nNow, to go to the pot at (3,0) from (3,3). Since (3,2) is blocked, he must go around. One way: go right to (4,3), then down to (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (4,2) is in the kitchen counter list. So non-walkable. So he cannot go down from (4,3) to (4,2). Similarly, if he goes left to (2,3), then down to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable). Then how can he get to the pot?\n\nHe must go around the kitchen counters. For example, from (3,3):\n- Move right to (4,3) [facing right? because move changes orientation]\n- Then move down? (4,2) is blocked. So move right again? But (5,3) is not listed as non-empty? The non-empty tiles are only the ones in the lists. (5,3) is not in kitchen counter (kitchen counters at (5,0), (5,2), (5,4) ... (5,3) is not there). So (5,3) is empty? Then he can go right to (5,3). Then down to (5,2)? But (5,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, so non-walkable. So he cannot go down to (5,2). Then from (5,3), he can go down? No, because (5,2) is blocked. So go left to (4,3) again? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) move left to (2,3). Then down to (2,2) is blocked. Then left to (1,3)? (1,3) is not in non-empty? Then down to (1,2)? (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at (0,1), (7,1), (0,3), (7,3) ... (1,2) is not listed, so empty. Then from (1,2) down to (1,1)? (1,1) not listed, so empty. Then down to (1,0)? (1,0) is kitchen counter? Yes, (1,0) is in the list. So non-walkable. Then he can go right to (2,0)? (2,0) is kitchen counter, non-walkable. Then how to get to (3,0)?\n\nThe pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Both are at y=0. The row y=1: (0,1) and (7,1) are kitchen counters, but (1,1) to (6,1) are not listed? So they are empty? But Alice is at (6,1) which is empty? Because (6,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? Wait, kitchen counters at (6,0) and (7,0) and (7,1), but (6,1) is not listed. So (6,1) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is not listed, so empty.\n\nBut to get to (3,0) from the north, we have to go through (3,1). But (3,1) is empty and walkable. However, Bob is at (3,3). To get to (3,1), he must go through (3,2) which is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. So he cannot go directly south.\n\nHe must go around. One way: go to the east or west and then down to y=1 and then west or east to (3,1).\n\nFor example, Bob at (3,3):\n- Move right to (4,3) [facing right]\n- Then move down? (4,2) is kitchen counter, blocked.\n- So move right to (5,3) [facing right] -> (5,3) is empty? Then move down to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter with onion, blocked.\n- So from (5,3), move right to (6,3) -> (6,3) not listed, empty. Then down to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed? Kitchen counters at (5,2) and (7,2) (serving counter) but (6,2) is not listed? So empty? Then down to (6,1) but Alice is at (6,1) at the start? And players cannot walk through each other. So if Bob goes to (6,1), but Alice is there? At turn 38, Alice is at (6,1). So Bob cannot go to (6,1) because Alice is there.\n\nAlternatively, Bob goes west:\n- From (3,3) move left to (2,3) [facing left]\n- Then left to (1,3) [facing left] -> (1,3) empty\n- Then down to (1,2) [facing down] -> (1,2) empty\n- Then down to (1,1) [facing down] -> (1,1) empty\n- Then right to (2,1) [facing right] -> (2,1) empty? Then right to (3,1) [facing right] -> (3,1) empty\n- Then down to (3,0) [facing down] -> but (3,0) is a pot, non-walkable. But he doesn't need to walk on it; he needs to be adjacent and face it to interact.\n\nSo to interact with the pot at (3,0), he can stand at (3,1) and face down. Because (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) and empty.\n\nSimilarly, for Alice at (6,1) facing down:\n- She can move left to (5,1) [facing left] -> (5,1) empty? Then left to (4,1) [facing left] -> (4,1) empty? Then left to (3,1) [facing left] -> but Bob might be going there? And (3,1) can only hold one player.\n\nWe have to coordinate so they don't block each other.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to use the pot at (4,0) as well? Or focus on one pot.\n\nBut we have only two onions in hand and two on counters. We need three for a soup.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe have two onions on kitchen counters: one at (5,2) and one at (5,4). Both players are holding an onion. They can put their onions on an empty kitchen counter first, then one player can pick up a third onion and put it in the pot, then the other player can put one of the onions from the counter into the pot, etc.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nAnother idea: use the onions on the counters. Since both players are holding onions, they cannot pick up the onions on the counters until they put down their current onion.\n\nSo, let's have Alice put her onion on an empty kitchen counter near her. For example, at (6,0) or (7,0) but (6,0) and (7,0) are kitchen counters? And they are empty? Because the non-empty ones are only (5,2) and (5,4). So (6,0) is empty kitchen counter? Then Alice at (6,1) facing down. To put an onion on (6,0), she must be adjacent and facing it. She is at (6,1), and (6,0) is directly below. She is facing down, so she can interact with (6,0) without moving? But she is on (6,1) and (6,0) is adjacent below. And she is facing down, so she can interact. Interact with kitchen counter: if player is holding an item and counter is empty, she can place the item.\n\nSo Alice can do: Interact (I) to place her onion on (6,0).\n\nThen she is free to pick up another item.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can do the same? But Bob is at (3,3) facing up. He can place his onion on a kitchen counter near him. For example, at (3,2) is a kitchen counter but empty? Because non-empty ones are (5,2) and (5,4). So (3,2) is empty. But he is at (3,3) facing up. (3,2) is below him, so he must face down to interact with it. So he needs to change orientation to down first.\n\nBut let's make a step-by-step plan for a few turns.\n\nWe are at turn 38.\n\nFirst, for Alice at (6,1) facing down, holding onion:\n- She can interact with the kitchen counter at (6,0) below her? (6,0) is a kitchen counter tile. She is on (6,1) which is empty, adjacent to (6,0), and facing down (towards (6,0)). So she can interact to place the onion on (6,0). Then she will be empty-handed.\n\nAction for Alice at turn 38: I (interact)\n\nThen she places the onion on (6,0). Now she is free.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3) facing up, holding onion. He can change orientation to down and then interact with (3,2) below him? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and currently empty? Yes. So:\n- Bob needs to change orientation to down. But the action \"Change Orientation\" (L/R/U/D) is only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? Or can he change orientation freely? The description: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\nWait, the description: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is ambiguous. Does it mean that if the adjacent tile in the new orientation direction is not empty, then the orientation change doesn't happen? Or does it mean that if the adjacent tile is not empty, then there is no move (but orientation change is allowed)? \n\nRe-read: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means: when you choose a direction for orientation change, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty (i.e., it's a non-empty tile like a counter, etc.), then you do not move (you just change orientation). But if it is empty, then you might move? No, the action is \"Change Orientation\", so it should only change orientation without moving. But the description says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which suggests that if the adjacent tile is empty, then you might move? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me read carefully: \n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it's poorly worded. But from the context, the \"Change Orientation\" action only changes orientation and does not change position. The \"No move\" probably means that the player does not change position, only orientation. The condition \"if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a mistake? Or it might mean that if the player tries to move in that direction but cannot because the tile is not empty, then they change orientation instead? But that's not what it says.\n\nLooking back: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it should be: this action changes the orientation to the specified direction without moving, regardless of the adjacent tile. The phrase \"No move\" might emphasize that there is no movement, only orientation change. And the condition is redundant? Or it might be that if the adjacent tile is empty, then changing orientation might allow a subsequent move? Anyway, for now, I think Bob can change orientation to down without any problem.\n\nSo Bob can do:\n- Change orientation to down (action D for down orientation? But the actions are U/D/L/R for up/down/left/right movement or orientation. The action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So for orientation change, we use the same letters? The description says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\".\n\nIn the action set, when we output, it's the same letters. So for Bob to change orientation to down, he would use action 'D'. But 'D' is also for move down. How to distinguish?\n\nThe action list per turn: each action is one of U, D, L, R, I, S. The description says:\n\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nSo the same letter can mean either move or change orientation? That is confusing.\n\nBut in the context, when a player issues an action, if the action is a direction (U/D/L/R), it could be interpreted as:\n\n- If the player can move in that direction (i.e., the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable), then they move and change orientation to that direction.\n- Otherwise, if they cannot move (because the tile is not empty), then they only change orientation to that direction.\n\nThis is a common mechanic in Overcooked.\n\nSo for Bob at (3,3) facing up, if he does 'D' (down), it means he tries to move down. But the tile below (3,2) is a kitchen counter, non-walkable, so he cannot move down. Therefore, he only changes orientation to down.\n\nSimilarly, if he does 'D' and the tile below is empty, he moves down and faces down.\n\nSo for Bob, to change orientation to down without moving, he can do 'D' and since (3,2) is not empty, he only changes orientation to down.\n\nSo Bob at turn 38: action 'D' (down) to change orientation to down.\n\nThen at turn 39, he can interact with (3,2) below him, because he is on (3,3) empty tile, adjacent to (3,2) and facing down. He can place his onion on (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is a kitchen counter, and it's empty, so he can place it.\n\nNow, after these actions, both players have placed their onions on kitchen counters and are empty-handed.\n\nThen they can pick up the onions that are on the kitchen counters to use for the pot.\n\nBut there are also two onions on (5,2) and (5,4). We can use those.\n\nBut let's plan turns.\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: I (interact with (6,0) to place onion)\n- Bob: D (tries to move down, but (3,2) is blocked, so only changes orientation to down)\n\nAfter turn 38:\n- Alice: at (6,1), facing down, holding nothing. (6,0) now has an onion.\n- Bob: at (3,3), facing down, holding onion.\n\nTurn 39:\n- Alice: now she can go to get a plate or another onion. But we need to put onions in the pot. Since she is near the serving area and plate dispenser, perhaps she can get a plate? Plate dispenser at (0,2). But that is far.\n  Alternatively, she can pick up the onion from (5,2) or (5,4)? But (5,2) is closer? (5,2) is at (5,2), she is at (6,1). She needs to go to (5,2) but (5,2) is non-walkable. So she must be adjacent to interact. She can go to (5,1) or (6,2) or (5,3) etc. and face (5,2).\n\n  Let's see: from (6,1), move left to (5,1) [facing left]. Then from (5,1), she can face down to interact with (5,2) below? But (5,2) is south of (5,1). She is at (5,1) facing left. She needs to face down to interact with (5,2). So she can change orientation to down? By doing 'D' which might move her down if possible. (5,0) is below (5,1)? (5,0) is a kitchen counter, non-walkable. So if she does 'D' from (5,1), she tries to move down to (5,0) but blocked, so only changes orientation to down. Then she can interact with (5,2)? But (5,2) is not adjacent to (5,1)? (5,1) and (5,2) are not adjacent; they are the same x, y+1 and y. (5,1) and (5,2) are adjacent vertically. (5,1) is above (5,2). So if she is at (5,1) facing down, she is facing (5,2) which is below, so adjacent. Yes.\n\n  But (5,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up if she is empty-handed.\n\n  Alternatively, she could go to the onion dispenser to get an onion. The dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4). But that is farther.\n\n  Since there is an onion at (5,2), she can pick that up.\n\n  Steps for Alice at turn 39:\n  - Move left to (5,1) [action L: moves to (5,1) and faces left]\n  - Then she needs to face down to interact with (5,2). So at turn 39, she can only move to (5,1). Then at turn 40, she can do 'D' to face down (since (5,0) is blocked, so only orientation change). Then at turn 41, she can interact to pick up the onion from (5,2).\n\n  That takes two more turns.\n\n  But we are planning for several turns, so it's okay.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob at turn 39:\n- He is at (3,3) facing down, holding onion. He can interact with (3,2) below him to place the onion. Action: I.\n\nAfter turn 39:\n- Bob: places onion on (3,2), now empty-handed.\n\nThen Bob can go to get another onion or to the pot.\n\nBut we need to fill a pot with 3 onions.\n\nLet's choose a pot, say (3,0).\n\nTo put an onion in (3,0), a player must be at (3,1) facing down, or at (2,0) facing right, or at (4,0) facing left. But (2,0) and (4,0) are kitchen counters? (2,0) is kitchen counter, (4,0) is a pot? (4,0) is a pot tile. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), so (4,0) is a pot, not kitchen counter. So to interact with (3,0), the player must be at an adjacent empty tile: (3,1), (2,0), or (4,0)? But (2,0) is kitchen counter, non-walkable. (4,0) is a pot, non-walkable. So only (3,1) is available. Player must be at (3,1) and face the pot (down for (3,0)).\n\n(3,1) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3) after placing onion on (3,2) at turn 39, is at (3,3) facing down, empty-handed.\n\nHe can go to (3,1) to interact with the pot. But how? (3,2) is between (3,3) and (3,1), but (3,2) is non-walkable. So he must go around.\n\nFor example:\n- Move right to (4,3) [facing right]\n- Then move down? (4,2) is kitchen counter, blocked.\n- Then move right to (5,3) [facing right]\n- Then down to (5,2)? Blocked.\n- Then right to (6,3) [facing right]\n- Then down to (6,2) [assuming empty, facing down]\n- Then down to (6,1)? But Alice might be there or moving.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternative: use the pot at (4,0) instead? (4,0) is a pot. To interact, player must be at (4,1) facing down, or (3,0) facing right, or (5,0) facing left. (3,0) and (5,0) are non-walkable. (5,0) is kitchen counter. So only (4,1) is available.\n\n(4,1) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo for (4,0), the player must be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nBob at (3,3) can go to (4,1) via:\n- Move right to (4,3) [facing right]\n- Then since (4,2) is blocked, move right again to (5,3) [facing right]\n- Then down to (5,2) blocked, so move down not possible. Then move left to (4,3) again? Not helpful.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can go down? No, (4,2) blocked. So go to (4,4)? (4,4) is an onion dispenser, non-walkable. So not.\n\nHe must go down to y=1 via the east or west.\n\nFrom (3,3) move east to (4,3), then east to (5,3), then south to (5,2) blocked, then east to (6,3), then south to (6,2) [empty], then south to (6,1) [empty or Alice might be there].\n\nAlice might be at (5,1) or moving.\n\nThis is complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better plan: since we have onions on kitchen counters, and both players are empty after placing, we can have one player start filling the pot while the other brings the third onion.\n\nLet's refocus.\n\nAfter turn 38 and 39:\n- Alice has placed her onion on (6,0) and is at (6,1) empty.\n- Bob has changed orientation to down at turn 38, and at turn 39 he places onion on (3,2), so at (3,3) empty.\n\nNow, turn 40:\n\nAlice can go to the onion at (5,2) to pick it up. She is at (6,1) after turn 38. At turn 39, she moved to (5,1) with action L. So at turn 40, she is at (5,1) facing left.\n\nTo interact with (5,2) below, she needs to face down. So action: D (down) at turn 40. Since (5,0) is blocked, she only changes orientation to down.\n\nThen at turn 41, she can interact to pick up the onion from (5,2). Action I.\n\nSo by turn 41, Alice is holding an onion.\n\nBob at turn 40: he is at (3,3) facing down (from turn 38 and 39 actions). He is empty. He can go to an onion dispenser to get an onion, or to a kitchen counter with onion.\n\nThe closest onion might be at (5,4) or (5,2) but (5,2) is being picked by Alice.\n\nOr he can go to (3,4) onion dispenser. But (3,4) is above him. He is at (3,3) facing down. To go to (3,4), he needs to face up and interact. But (3,4) is adjacent north.\n\nSo at turn 40, Bob can change orientation to up? Action U (up). Since (3,4) is non-empty (dispenser), he cannot move up, so only changes orientation to up.\n\nThen at turn 41, he can interact with (3,4) to get an onion. Action I.\n\nThen he will be holding an onion.\n\nThen both players have an onion.\n\nThen they can go to a pot to put it in.\n\nBut we need three onions in one pot.\n\nThere is an onion on (5,4) kitchen counter. And Alice will have one, Bob will have one.\n\nSo we need to get that third onion or have one player put two.\n\nBut a player can only carry one at a time.\n\nSo after both have an onion, one can put in the pot, then go get the third.\n\nChoose a pot, say (4,0).\n\nAlice at turn 41: at (5,1) facing down, holding onion (after picking up from (5,2)).\n\nShe can go to (4,1) to put the onion in the pot at (4,0).\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1): move left to (4,1) [action L: moves to (4,1) and faces left].\n\nThen at (4,1) facing left, she can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0)? (4,0) is below (4,1). So she needs to face down. Action D at turn 42: since (4,0) is non-walkable, she only changes orientation to down. Then turn 43, interact to add onion to the pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at turn 41: at (3,3) facing up, holding onion (after getting from dispenser).\n\nHe can go to the pot at (4,0). From (3,3) to (4,1): \n- Move right to (4,3) [facing right]\n- Then move down? (4,2) blocked, so only change orientation? Action D at turn 42: tries to move down, but (4,2) blocked, so only faces down.\n- Then at turn 43, he is at (4,3) facing down. He can move down? No, (4,2) blocked. So he needs to go around to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) facing down, he can move right to (5,3) [action R] at turn 43? Then down to (5,2) blocked. Then left to (4,3) again? Not good.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move right to (5,3), then down not possible, then move right to (6,3), then down to (6,2), then down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), then left to (4,1). This is long.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) after getting the onion, he can go south via a different path. But (3,2) is blocked.\n\nPerhaps have Bob put his onion in the pot at (3,0) instead.\n\nFor (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nBob at (3,3) facing up, holding onion.\n\nHow to get to (3,1)? He must go around.\n\nFor example:\n- Move left to (2,3) [action L] at turn 40? We are at turn 40 for Bob: earlier at turn 40, we said he does U to change orientation to up, but then at turn 41 he interacts to get onion.\n\nLet's reset Bob's actions.\n\nAt turn 40: Bob is at (3,3) facing down, empty-handed. Instead of going to the dispenser, he can go to the kitchen counter at (5,4) to pick up the onion there? (5,4) is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\nHe is at (3,3). (5,4) is at (5,4). He can go east then north.\n\nActions for Bob:\n- Turn 40: move right to (4,3) [facing right]\n- Turn 41: move right to (5,3) [facing right]\n- Turn 42: move up to (5,4)? (5,4) is a kitchen counter with onion, non-walkable. So he cannot move up. So action U at turn 42: tries to move up to (5,4) but blocked, so only changes orientation to up.\n- Turn 43: interact with (5,4) to pick up the onion. Action I.\n\nThen he has the onion.\n\nThen he can go to the pot.\n\nBut this is taking many turns.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we are only to plan for Alice, perhaps we focus on Alice's actions and assume Bob will cooperate.\n\nThe task is to \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". We can plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will do reasonable things.\n\nBut the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can output only Alice's actions.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should coordinate.\n\nSince the plan is complicated, let's aim for a simple strategy.\n\nSimple strategy: both players go to the same pot and put their onions, then one player gets the third onion.\n\nChoose the pot at (4,0) because it might be easier to access from the east.\n\nAlice's path to (4,0):\n- Start at (6,1) facing down.\n- Turn 38: she can move left to (5,1) [action L]\n- Turn 39: move left to (4,1) [action L]\n- At (4,1) facing left, she can interact with the pot at (4,0) below her? But she is facing left, not down. So she needs to face down.\n- Turn 40: action D to face down (since (4,0) below is non-walkable, so only orientation change to down).\n- Turn 41: interact to add her onion to the pot. Now the pot has 1 onion.\n\nThen she is empty.\n\nBob, we assume he will do something similar.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,3) holding onion. He can go to (4,1) to add to the pot, but Alice is there at turn 41? (4,1) can only have one player.\n\nSo they might block.\n\nTo avoid blocking, perhaps Alice after putting her onion, moves away.\n\nFor example, after adding onion at turn 41, she can move right to (5,1) [action R] at turn 42.\n\nThen Bob can come to (4,1) to add his onion.\n\nBob's path to (4,1):\n- From (3,3) facing up.\n- Turn 38: we need to specify, but the plan starts at turn 38 for Alice, and for Bob we can suggest or assume.\n\nSince the output is for Alice, we only output Alice's actions.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 38: L (move left to (5,1), facing left)\nTurn 39: L (move left to (4,1), facing left)\nTurn 40: D (change orientation to down, since move down not possible)\nTurn 41: I (interact with pot at (4,0) to add onion)\n\nThen the pot has 1 onion.\n\nThen Alice is empty. She can go to get another onion for the pot.\n\nFor example, to get the onion from (5,2):\n- She is at (4,1) after turn 41? No, after turn 41 she is still at (4,1) because interact doesn't move.\n- Turn 42: move right to (5,1) [action R]\n- Turn 43: D (face down towards (5,2))\n- Turn 44: I (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nThen she has an onion, and can go back to the pot to add it.\n\nTurn 45: move left to (4,1) [action L]\nTurn 46: D (face down, if not already)\nTurn 47: I (add onion to pot) - now pot has 2 onions.\n\nWe need one more.\n\nThen she can get the onion from (5,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut this is slow.\n\nAlternatively, after the first onion, she can go to the onion dispenser.\n\nBut let's see if Bob can help.\n\nSince we are only planning for Alice, and the horizon H is not specified, we can plan for about 10 turns.\n\nBut to deliver the soup, we also need a plate and then serve.\n\nSo overall steps:\n1. Fill a pot with 3 onions.\n2. Wait for it to cook (5 turns).\n3. Get a plate.\n4. Serve the soup.\n\nSo after the pot has 3 onions, it will cook in 5 turns, then can be served.\n\nAlice can after adding the first onion, go to get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) after turn 41:\n- Turn 42: move right to (5,1) [R]\n- Turn 43: move up to (5,2)? Blocked, so move right to (6,1) [R] (assuming (6,1) is empty)\n- Turn 44: move up to (6,2) [U] ( (6,2) empty? )\n- Turn 45: move up to (6,3) [U]\n- Turn 46: move left to (5,3) [L]\n- Turn 47: move left to (4,3) [L]\n- Turn 48: move left to (3,3) [L] ( (3,3) might have Bob, but assume not)\n- Turn 49: move left to (2,3) [L]\n- Turn 50: move left to (1,3) [L]\n- Turn 51: move down to (1,2) [D] ( (1,2) empty)\n- Turn 52: interact with (0,2) to get a plate? But (0,2) is plate dispenser. She is at (1,2) and needs to face west. So at turn 52: change orientation to west (action L) since (1,1) or (1,3) might be there, but she is at (1,2), so to face west, action L. Then turn 53: interact to get plate.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps a better initial plan.\n\nAnother idea: Alice and Bob both put their onions in the pot as soon as possible, then one gets the third onion from a kitchen counter.\n\nFor Alice to put onion in pot at (4,0) as above.\n\nFor Bob, we assume he will try to put his onion in the same pot.\n\nAt turn 38:\nAlice: L ( to (5,1) )\nBob: say, move right to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut since we only output Alice's actions, we do:\n\nAlice at turn 38: L ( to (5,1) )\n turn 39: L ( to (4,1) )\n turn 40: D ( face down )\n turn 41: I ( add onion to (4,0) pot)\n\nThen the pot has 1 onion.\n\nThen Alice can move away to let Bob in.\n\nTurn 42: R ( move right to (5,1) )\n\nThen Bob can come to (4,1) to add his onion.\n\nThen the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen Alice can get the third onion from (5,2):\n\nTurn 43: D ( face down to (5,2) )\n turn 44: I ( pick up onion from (5,2) )\n turn 45: L ( move left to (4,1) ) -> but if Bob is there, she cannot. So perhaps wait or go to (4,1) when free.\n\nAssume Bob has added his onion and moved away.\n\nAfter Bob adds, he might move away.\n\nThen Alice at (5,1) holding onion after turn 44, she can go to (4,1) if free.\n\nTurn 45: L ( to (4,1) )\n turn 46: D ( face down, if not)\n turn 47: I ( add onion) -> now pot has 3 onions, starts cooking.\n\nThen after 5 turns, it will be cooked.\n\nThen Alice can go to get a plate.\n\nBut this is many turns.\n\nPerhaps have Alice after adding the first onion, go to get a plate immediately, while Bob adds his onion and the third onion from a counter.\n\nBut Bob might not do that.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, and we can't control Bob, we must assume he will cooperate.\n\nBut to be safe, let's plan for Alice to complete the soup with the help of the counters.\n\nInitial action for Alice at turn 38: since she is at (6,1) facing down, and (6,0) is kitchen counter empty, she can interact to place the onion. So action I.\n\nThen she is empty.\n\nThen she can go to (5,1) and then face down to pick up the onion from (5,2).\n\nActions:\nTurn 38: I ( place onion on (6,0) )\nTurn 39: L ( move left to (5,1) )\nTurn 40: D ( face down)\nTurn 41: I ( pick up onion from (5,2) )\n\nNow she has an onion.\n\nThen she can go to the pot at (4,0) to add it.\n\nTurn 42: L ( move left to (4,1) )\nTurn 43: D ( face down)\nTurn 44: I ( add onion to pot) -> pot has 1 onion.\n\nThen she can go to the onion dispenser to get another onion for the pot.\n\nOnion dispenser at (4,4) or (3,4).\n\nFrom (4,1):\nTurn 45: U ( move up to (4,2)? Blocked, so only face up)\n Actually, (4,2) is kitchen counter, so cannot move up. So action U at turn 45: only change orientation to up.\nTurn 46: U again? Still cannot move, so only face up. She is at (4,1) facing up.\nTo move north, she must go around. For example, move right to (5,1) [R] at turn 46.\nTurn 47: U ( move up to (5,2) blocked, so only face up)\nTurn 48: U again, still blocked.\nSo she must move east first.\n\nFrom (4,1):\nTurn 45: R ( move right to (5,1) )\nTurn 46: U ( move up to (5,2) blocked, so only face up)\nTurn 47: R ( move right to (6,1) )\nTurn 48: U ( move up to (6,2) )\nTurn 49: U ( move up to (6,3) )\nTurn 50: L ( move left to (5,3) )\nTurn 51: U ( move up to (5,4) blocked, so only face up) - (5,4) is onion dispenser or kitchen counter? (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion, non-walkable.\nTurn 52: interact with (5,4) to pick up onion? But she is at (5,3) facing up, so adjacent to (5,4) north. So at turn 52: I to pick up the onion from (5,4) kitchen counter.\n\nThen she has an onion.\n\nThen she can go back to the pot to add it.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nGiven the complexity and the turn limit, perhaps it's better to have a shorter sequence.\n\nLet's output a sequence for Alice for the next 5 turns.\n\nAt turn 38, Alice is at (6,1) holding onion. The quickest way to contribute is to put it in a pot.\n\nBut the nearest pot is at (3,0) or (4,0), and (4,0) is closer.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (4,1): two moves left.\n\nSo:\nTurn 38: L ( to (5,1) )\nTurn 39: L ( to (4,1) )\nTurn 40: D ( face down)\nTurn 41: I ( add onion to (4,0) )\n\nThen for turn 42, she can move away to let Bob in, e.g., move right to (5,1) (action R).\n\nBut we need to output only the actions.\n\nSo for Alice, turns 38 to 42:\n\nTurn 38: L\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: D\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: R\n\nThis is a partial plan.\n\nThen she can be at (5,1) empty, and then she can try to pick up the onion from (5,2) or go for a plate.\n\nBut for now, this is a start.\n\nSince the problem asks to maximize reward, and we are at turn 38, we can try to complete a soup within 20 turns or so.\n\nBut without knowing H, we output a sequence.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think the first few turns for Alice should be to add her onion to the pot and then get out of the way.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nFinal answer for Alice:\n\nTurn 38: L\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: D\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: R\n\nThen she is at (5,1) facing right (because move right at turn 42).\n\nThen she can be ready to pick up the onion from (5,2) or something.\n\nBut for the answer, we output only the sequence for the next few turns.\n\nSince the turn is not specified, we output for turns 38 to 42.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nNote: the action history shows the most recent at the end, but for planning, we start from turn 38.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: L\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: D\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: R\n}\n\nThis is for Alice only.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and serve an onion soup, as it is the only recipe available (requiring 3 onions, cooking time of 5 turns, and a reward of 20). The current game state shows both players holding one onion each, with additional onions available on kitchen counters at (5,2) and (5,4). The pots at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty, and the serving counter is at (7,2). \n\n### Coordination Plan:\n1. **Immediate Goal**: Add onions to a pot to start cooking. The pot at (4,0) is chosen for efficiency, as it is closer to Alice's starting position (6,1). Alice will add her onion to this pot, while Bob is expected to add his onion to the same pot or assist with the third onion.\n2. **Alice's Role**: \n   - Alice should move to (4,1) to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n   - After adding her onion, she moves away to avoid blocking Bob.\n   - She can then prepare to fetch a plate or another onion if needed.\n3. **Bob's Expected Role (Coordination Assumption)**:\n   - Bob should add his onion to the pot at (4,0) by navigating to (4,1) (e.g., via (4,3) and (5,3), then south to (4,2) but blocked, requiring a longer path or use of the kitchen counter onion at (5,4)).\n   - Once the pot has 2 onions, Bob or Alice should add the third onion (e.g., from (5,2) or (5,4)) to start cooking.\n   - After cooking (5 turns), one player should get a plate from (0,2) and serve at (7,2).\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 38-42):\n- **Turn 38 (t=38)**: Move left to (5,1). This positions Alice closer to the pot at (4,0) and faces her left.\n- **Turn 39 (t=39)**: Move left to (4,1). Alice is now adjacent to the pot at (4,0) and faces left.\n- **Turn 40 (t=40)**: Change orientation down (action D). Since the tile below (4,0) is non-walkable, this only changes her orientation to face the pot.\n- **Turn 41 (t=41)**: Interact (I) to add her onion to the pot at (4,0). The pot now has 1 onion, and Alice is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 42 (t=42)**: Move right to (5,1). This clears (4,1) for Bob to access the pot and positions Alice to access the onion at (5,2) in subsequent turns.\n\n### Rationale:\n- This sequence ensures Alice contributes her onion quickly to start accumulating ingredients in the pot.\n- Moving away on turn 42 avoids player collision and allows Bob to add his onion next.\n- With Bob adding his onion and a third onion from a kitchen counter (e.g., Bob picks up the onion at (5,4) or (5,2)), the pot can reach 3 onions soon, starting the 5-turn cook time.\n- Alice can then fetch a plate or assist with serving, leveraging her position near (5,1) and the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nThis plan optimizes initial coordination, with Alice focusing on efficient movement and interaction to kickstart the cooking process. Bob is expected to mirror this effort based on his position and holdings.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: L\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: D\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the game state and plan actions for Alice to maximize the reward from delivering soup. The goal is to deliver as many soups as possible, especially the recipes that give higher rewards.\n\nFrom the recipe information, there's only one recipe: Recipe 1 requires 3 onions, 0 tomatoes, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a reward of 20. Since there are no tomato dispensers, we can only make onion soup.\n\nNow, the current game state:\n\n- Turn: 41\n- Alice: at (4,1), facing Left (L), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (2,3), facing Down (D), holding nothing.\n\nAction history is given, but I might not need it for planning future actions unless it indicates what they were doing. Alice's history: R, D, I, L, L. Bob's history: U, I, L, D, I. Since the most recent action is last, Alice's last action was L (move left?), and Bob's last action was I (interact).\n\nBut positions: Alice was at (4,1) after actions. Let me parse the actions to see if I can figure previous positions, but it might not be necessary for planning from now.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters:\n\n- (5,2): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (6,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n\nPots are all empty. Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nServing counter is at (7,2).\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSince pots are empty, we need to add ingredients to start cooking.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), facing left. Facing left means she is facing towards x-decreasing direction, so she might be able to interact with something to her left if adjacent.\n\nAdjacent tiles: left is (3,1), but what is at (3,1)? The tile types aren't fully listed, but from the grid, I need to infer.\n\nList all key points:\n\n- Kitchen counters: various positions, but only some have items.\n\n- Empty tiles are walkable, but not listed; dispensers, pots, etc., are specific.\n\nSince Alice is at (4,1), let's see the surroundings.\n\nGrid dimensions? Not specified, but from positions, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4? Positions go from (0,0) to (7,4).\n\nKitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), etc., but only some have items; others might be empty.\n\nFor movement, players can only walk on empty tiles or interact with adjacent tiles if facing them.\n\nAlice at (4,1), facing left. Left adjacent tile is (3,1). What is (3,1)? Not listed as a dispenser or pot, so probably an empty tile or kitchen counter? Kitchen counters are listed, but (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list: kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (3,1) is not a kitchen counter, and not a dispenser or pot, so it must be an empty tile. Similarly, other positions.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nAlice at (4,1). From (4,1), she can move to adjacent tiles.\n\nBut she is facing left, towards (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is empty, I think, so she could interact with it? But interact requires a non-empty tile, and (3,1) is empty, so she can't interact with it. Interact is for dispensers, pots, etc., which are non-empty tiles.\n\nThe rule: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo for Alice to interact with, say, a pot, she needs to be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the pot.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCurrently, Alice at (4,1), which might be an empty tile? Positions: (4,1) is not listed as any special tile, so it should be empty.\n\nShe is facing left, towards (3,1). (3,1) is not a non-empty tile, so she can't interact with anything there. She could change orientation or move.\n\nBob at (2,3), facing down, towards (2,2). (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, I think? Non-empty kitchen counters: (5,2) has onion, (2,2) has onion? From the list: \"Kitchen Counter on (2,2): contains a onion\" yes.\n\nSo Bob at (2,3), facing down towards (2,2). Since (2,2) is adjacent and he is facing it, and he is on (2,3), which is probably empty? (2,3) not listed, so empty. So he can interact with (2,2) to pick up the onion if he is empty-handed.\n\nBut in the action history, Bob's last action was I (interact). Since he is at (2,3) facing down, and (2,2) has an onion, he probably just interacted with it. Action history: U, I, L, D, I. Last action I, so he might have picked up the onion from (2,2).\n\nBut the state says Bob is holding nothing. Contradiction?\n\nGame state: \"Holding: nothing\" for both.\n\nBut action history: Bob's last action was I, and he was at (2,3) facing down, so he interacted with (2,2) which has an onion. If he was empty-handed, he should have picked up the onion, so now he should be holding onion. But state says holding nothing.\n\nSimilarly for Alice, action history ends with L, L, and she is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nPerhaps the action history includes the actions that led to the current state, so after the last action, the state is as given.\n\nFor Bob: he performed U, I, L, D, I. Let's simulate.\n\nStart from before actions. Turn t1=41, state is given after these actions.\n\nThe action history is for the previous turns, leading to turn 41.\n\nSo for Bob, actions: U, I, L, D, I. After these, he is at (2,3) holding nothing.\n\nSimilarly for Alice.\n\nPerhaps during the interact, he placed something or picked up but dropped, but kitchen counter at (2,2) has onion, so if he interacted, and was empty-handed, he should pick it up.\n\nUnless he wasn't facing correctly or something, but orientation is given.\n\nBob at (2,3) facing down, so facing (2,2), which is adjacent below him. So he can interact with (2,2).\n\nBut if he interacted and was empty-handed, he should now hold the onion. But state says holding nothing. Contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the action history is the sequence of actions taken, but it might include moves that didn't change state or something, but the rules say actions are per turn.\n\nAnother possibility: after interacting, he might have dropped it or something, but interact with kitchen counter: if he is empty-handed and counter occupied, he picks up; if holding item and counter empty, he places.\n\nIn this case, counter has onion, he empty-handed, so pick up onion. But state says holding nothing, so maybe he didn't pick it up? But why?\n\nPerhaps the orientation changed. Actions: U, I, L, D, I.\n\nLet's assume starting position. But we don't have initial position for the history.\n\nPerhaps the history is short, and we can infer.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should focus on the current state and plan from here.\n\nCurrent state: Bob holding nothing, at (2,3) facing down. Kitchen counter (2,2) has onion.\n\nHe can interact to pick it up.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (4,1) facing left, holding nothing.\n\nNow, pots are empty at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nWe need to fill pots with onions to make soup.\n\nRecipe requires 3 onions per pot.\n\nOnions available: from dispensers or from kitchen counters where onions are placed.\n\nKitchen counters have onions at: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2). So four onions on counters.\n\nAlso, onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) for getting more onions.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice is close to the pots at (3,0) and (4,0). She is at (4,1), which is above (4,0). (4,0) is a pot.\n\nAlice at (4,1), facing left. (4,0) is directly below her, but she is facing left, not down.\n\nTo interact with (4,0), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (4,1): up (4,2), down (4,0), left (3,1), right (5,1).\n\n(4,0) is below, so she needs to face down to interact with it.\n\nSimilarly, (3,0) is left and down.\n\nFirst, Alice can move down to (4,0)? But (4,0) is a pot, which is not empty, so she cannot walk onto it. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles.\n\nOnly empty tiles are walkable.\n\nSo Alice at (4,1) can move to adjacent empty tiles: (4,2), (3,1), (5,1), or (4,0) but (4,0) is pot, not empty, so cannot move there. Similarly, down to (4,0) not possible.\n\nSo possible moves: left to (3,1), right to (5,1), up to (4,2), or down not possible.\n\n(4,2) is a kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (4,2), which is listed, so it's a kitchen counter, not empty, so she cannot walk onto it. Only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nWhat tiles are empty?\n\nThe grid has empty tiles where not occupied by dispensers, pots, counters, etc.\n\nFor example, (4,1) is empty, since not listed.\n\n(3,1) not listed, so empty.\n\n(5,1) not listed, so empty.\n\n(4,2) is a kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\n(3,0) pot, not walkable.\n\n(4,0) pot, not walkable.\n\n(5,0) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo from (4,1), Alice can move to (3,1) or (5,1), since (4,2) and (4,0) are not empty.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter, so not walkable. Similarly, (4,0) not walkable.\n\nUp to (4,2) not possible, down to (4,0) not possible, left to (3,1) possible, right to (5,1) possible.\n\nAlso, she can change orientation or stay.\n\nSimilarly, for interacting, to interact with pot at (4,0), she needs to be on an adjacent empty tile facing it. Adjacent empty tiles to (4,0): above (4,1), left (3,0) but (3,0) is pot, not empty, right (5,0) kitchen counter not empty, below? (4,-1) out of bound, so only (4,1) is adjacent empty tile to (4,0).\n\nSimilarly for (3,0), adjacent empty tiles: above (3,1), right (4,0) not empty, left (2,0) kitchen counter not empty, below (3,-1) out of bound, so only (3,1) is adjacent empty tile to (3,0).\n\nTo interact with (4,0) pot, Alice needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,0) pot, at (3,1) facing down.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (4,1), facing left. So she is not facing down, so she cannot interact with (4,0) yet.\n\nShe can change orientation to face down, then interact to add ingredient if holding one.\n\nBut she is holding nothing.\n\nFirst, she needs to get an onion.\n\nOnions available on kitchen counters or from dispensers.\n\nNearest onion to Alice: kitchen counter at (5,2) has onion, but (5,2) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\nTo interact with (5,2), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\n(5,2) is at position (5,2). Adjacent empty tiles: above (5,3)? Not listed, let's see possible.\n\nPositions around (5,2): left (4,2) kitchen counter, not empty; right (6,2)? Not listed; up (5,3)? Not listed; down (5,1)? Not listed, so (5,1) might be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) might be empty.\n\nAssume that tiles not listed as special are empty.\n\nSo for (5,2), adjacent tiles: (4,2) kitchen counter, (6,2) not listed, probably empty; (5,1) not listed, empty; (5,3) not listed, empty.\n\nBut (6,2) and (5,1), (5,3) need to be checked if they exist.\n\ny=1, x=5: (5,1) not listed, so empty.\n\ny=3, x=5: (5,3) not listed, empty.\n\nx=6,y=2: (6,2) not listed, but kitchen counters are at (6,0) and (7,0), etc., not (6,2), so probably empty.\n\nSimilarly, other positions.\n\nSo for Alice to interact with kitchen counter at (5,2) to pick up onion, she needs to be on an adjacent empty tile facing (5,2).\n\nPossible positions: (6,2), (5,1), or (5,3), facing towards (5,2).\n\nSimilarly for other counters.\n\nAlice is at (4,1). (4,1) to (5,2) is not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y diff 1.\n\n(4,1) and (5,2) are diagonal, not adjacent. So not directly accessible.\n\nShe needs to move to, say, (5,1) or (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she can move to (5,1) or (3,1) or (4,2) not possible.\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move right to (5,1), which is empty.\n\nFrom (5,1), she can face up to interact with (5,2) kitchen counter above her.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), so from (5,1), facing up, she can interact with (5,2) since adjacent and facing.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,2) or (5,3).\n\nBut (5,1) is closer.\n\n(5,1) is empty, so she can move there.\n\nThen from (5,1), face up and interact to pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up.\n\nSimilarly, there are other onions.\n\nBut Alice is at (4,1), so moving to (5,1) is one step.\n\nShe could go to the pots directly, but she needs an item first.\n\nSince pots are empty, adding an onion is useful.\n\nBob is at (2,3), facing down, and (2,2) has an onion, so he can interact to pick it up, since he is empty-handed.\n\nThen he can carry it to a pot.\n\nNow, let's plan for the next few turns. We need to deliver soup, but soup takes time to cook.\n\nPots are empty, so we need to add ingredients.\n\nFirst, add onions to pots.\n\nThere are two pots, so we can start two soups.\n\nEach soup needs three onions.\n\nOnions available: four on counters, and dispensers for more.\n\nBut we should use the onions on counters first to save time.\n\nAlice can go to (5,1), pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nThen she can go to a pot, say (4,0), to add the onion.\n\nFrom (5,1), to (4,1), then to (4,1), she can face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nBut she needs to be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can pick up onion from (2,2) and go to a pot, say (3,0).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), Bob at (2,3) facing down, so he can interact to pick up onion.\n\nThen he can move to (3,1) or something to access pot.\n\n(3,0) pot, adjacent empty tile is (3,1).\n\nSo Bob at (2,3), after picking up onion, he can move to (3,3)? (3,3) not listed, probably empty, then to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can move to (3,1) via (3,3) and (3,2) not, let's see path.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,1): possible moves.\n\n(2,3) to right (3,3) if empty, then down to (3,2) but (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot move to (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2) not possible, so he can go to (3,1) via (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3)? Messy.\n\nPositions: (2,3) to east (3,3), if empty.\n\n(3,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nFrom (3,3), can move south to (3,2)? (3,2) kitchen counter, not empty, cannot.\n\nMove west back, or east to (4,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,1), which is adjacent to pot (3,0).\n\n(3,1) is empty.\n\nHow to get to (3,1) from (2,3).\n\nOne way: (2,3) to (2,2) not possible, (2,2) not empty.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4)? (2,4) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\ny=4, (2,4) kitchen counter.\n\nBob at (2,3), facing down.\n\nAdjacent tiles: up (2,4) kitchen counter, not walkable; down (2,2) kitchen counter, not walkable; left (1,3)? Not listed, probably empty; right (3,3)? Not listed, empty.\n\nSo he can move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3).\n\nThen from there to other places.\n\nTo reach (3,1), from (2,3) he can move right to (3,3), then from (3,3) move down to (3,2) not possible, so he can move to (4,3) or something, but (3,1) is at y=1.\n\nHe can go to (3,3) then to (4,3) if empty, then down to (4,2) kitchen counter not empty, not possible.\n\nList the empty tiles around.\n\nPerhaps from (2,3) to (1,3), then down to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, probably empty, but (1,2) to (1,1), etc., but to reach (3,1), it might take multiple moves.\n\nSince (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0), and Alice is near there.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), which is close to (3,1).\n\n(4,1) and (3,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAlice at (4,1) can move left to (3,1), which is empty.\n\nThen from (3,1), she can face down to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nSimilarly for (4,0) from (4,1).\n\nBut she needs to hold an item.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nFirst, Alice can move to get an onion.\n\nOption: move to (5,1) to access (5,2) onion.\n\nOr move to (3,1) to be near pot.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, she should pick one up.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nLet's sequence the actions.\n\nTurn t1=41, we plan for t1 to t1+H, say H=5 or something, but H not specified, so we need to choose a horizon.\n\nSince soup cooks in 5 turns, we should plan for at least that.\n\nBut let's start with immediate actions.\n\nAt turn 41:\n\nAlice is at (4,1) facing left, holding nothing.\n\nShe can move right to (5,1) to get closer to (5,2) onion.\n\nThen at (5,1), she can face up and interact to pick up onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (2,3) facing down, can interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nBut in state, he is holding nothing, so if he interacts, he will pick up the onion.\n\nAction history shows last action was I, but state says holding nothing, so perhaps the interact was not successful or something, but let's assume he can interact now to pick up.\n\nPerhaps the action history is for turns before, and the state is after.\n\nI think we should go with the current state.\n\nSo for turn 41:\n\nAlice action: move right (R) to (5,1).\n\nBob action: since he is facing down and adjacent to (2,2) with onion, he can interact (I) to pick up the onion.\n\nBut the plan is for Alice, and optionally Bob, but we can suggest for both to coordinate.\n\nThe task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can plan for both.\n\nTo maximize efficiency, we should coordinate.\n\nSo let's plan for both players.\n\nTurn 41:\n\n- Alice: move right to (5,1)\n\n- Bob: interact to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nAfter Bob interacts, he is now holding an onion.\n\n(2,2) kitchen counter now empty.\n\nAlice moves to (5,1), now at (5,1), holding nothing.\n\nTurn 42:\n\nAlice at (5,1), can change orientation to face up (U) to face (5,2).\n\nThen she can interact to pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nBut changing orientation is an action, so she needs to face up first.\n\nActions: she can change orientation to up, then interact.\n\nBut each turn one action.\n\nSo turn 42: Alice change orientation to up (U) to face north.\n\nThen she can interact next turn.\n\nShe could have moved directly, but she is already at (5,1), so to interact with (5,2) above, she needs to face up.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is now holding onion, at (2,3), needs to go to a pot.\n\nNearest pot is (3,0) or (4,0).\n\n(3,0) is closer via (3,1).\n\nBut (2,3) to (3,1): as before, not directly adjacent.\n\n(2,3) to (3,3) (east), then to (3,2) not possible, so to (4,3) or something.\n\n(2,3) to (3,3) if empty.\n\n(3,3) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2) not possible, so to (4,3) if empty, then to (4,2) not possible, (4,2) kitchen counter.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,2) not, so down to (4,1) but (4,1) is not adjacent vertically if y diff, (4,3) to (4,2) is adjacent down, but (4,2) not empty, cannot move.\n\nSo Bob at (2,3) can move east to (3,3), then from (3,3) move south-east or something, but only cardinal directions.\n\nFrom (3,3) he can move east to (4,3), then from (4,3) move south to (4,2) not possible, or move west, but not to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at y=1, x=3.\n\nHow to get from (2,3) to (3,1).\n\nOne way: (2,3) move east to (3,3), then from (3,3) move south to (3,2) not possible, so he can move to (2,3) to (1,3) west, then from (1,3) move south to (1,2), then east to (2,2) not empty, or to (1,1), etc.\n\n(1,2) not listed, probably empty.\n\nAssume (1,2) empty.\n\nThen from (1,2) he can move east to (2,2) not possible, so to (1,1) south, then east to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nLong way.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (5,3), then down to (5,2) not empty, not possible.\n\nPerhaps (3,1) can be reached from (4,1) or (3,0) not, only from (3,1) itself.\n\nAlice is at (5,1), which is closer to (4,1), but let's focus.\n\nSince Alice is near (4,0) pot, and Bob is farther, perhaps Alice should add onion to pot, and Bob can go to other pot or get more onions.\n\nBut pots are both empty.\n\nList the positions.\n\nAlice at (5,1) after move.\n\nTurn 42:\n\nAlice at (5,1), can change orientation to up (U) to face (5,2).\n\nThen turn 43: interact to pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nBob at (2,3) holding onion, needs to go to a pot.\n\nThe pot at (3,0) can be accessed from (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is empty, and Alice was there, but now empty.\n\nBob can move to (3,3) first.\n\nTurn 42: Bob move east to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), he can move south to (3,2) not possible, so he can move to (4,3) or down to (3,1) not directly.\n\n(3,3) to (3,1) is not adjacent, he needs to go to (4,3) then to (4,2) not, or to (3,4) but (3,4) is onion dispenser, not empty.\n\n(3,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo from (3,3), he can move east to (4,3) if empty.\n\n(4,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen from (4,3), he can move south to (4,2) not possible, or west to (3,3), or east to (5,3), or north to (4,4) but (4,4) onion dispenser not walkable.\n\nSo he can move south from (4,3) to (4,2) not, so only horizontal or to empty tiles.\n\n(4,3) to (4,2) is down, but (4,2) occupied, so cannot.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,3) east, if empty.\n\n(5,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen from (5,3) to (5,2) not possible, or to (6,3), etc.\n\nThis is taking too long; he needs to go down to y=1.\n\nThere might be a path via (1,3) and down, but let's assume he can reach (3,1) in a few moves.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3) (1 move east), then to (3,4) not, so to (4,3) (2 moves), then to (5,3) (3 moves), then from (5,3) he can move south to (5,2) not possible, so to (5,4)? (5,4) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\n(5,4) has onion, but it's a counter, not walkable.\n\nFrom (5,3) move south not possible, so move to (6,3) if empty, then to (6,2) or something.\n\n(6,2) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (6,2) he can go to (6,1) or (6,0) kitchen counter not empty.\n\n(6,0) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (6,1) south if empty.\n\n(6,1) not listed, empty.\n\nThen to (6,0) not, or to (5,1) but (5,1) may have Alice or not.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nSince (3,1) is the only access to (3,0), and it's empty, Bob can move directly if possible, but from (2,3) to (3,1) not adjacent.\n\nThe shortest path: from (2,3) move down to (2,2) not possible, so he must move horizontally or vertically to empty tiles.\n\nMove east to (3,3), then since (3,2) occupied, he can move south to (3,1) but not adjacent, (3,3) to (3,1) not adjacent, only if same row or column with diff 1.\n\nSo he needs to go to a tile that is adjacent to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), adjacent tiles: north (3,2) occupied, south (3,0) occupied, west (2,1), east (4,1).\n\n(2,1) not listed, probably empty.\n\n(4,1) may be empty or not.\n\nSo Bob can move to (2,1) or (4,1) to access (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) itself is the position to stand on to interact with pot.\n\nTo interact with (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nSo he needs to move to (3,1).\n\nHow to get to (3,1) from (2,3).\n\nOne way: (2,3) move west to (1,3) if empty.\n\n(1,3) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (1,3) move south to (1,2) if empty.\n\n(1,2) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (1,2) move south to (1,1) if empty.\n\n(1,1) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (1,1) move east to (2,1) if empty.\n\n(2,1) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (2,1) move east to (3,1).\n\nSo 5 moves: west, south, south, east, east.\n\nLong way.\n\nFrom (2,3) move east to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (4,2) not possible, or to (5,3), then to (5,2) not, or to (4,4) not, so no shorter path.\n\nPerhaps through other counters, but it seems at least 4-5 moves for Bob to reach (3,1).\n\nWhereas Alice is at (4,1), which is adjacent to (3,1), so she can move to (3,1) in one move left.\n\nThen from there, she can add to pot.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0).\n\nSo perhaps Alice should handle the pots since she is closer.\n\nBob can focus on getting more onions or plates.\n\nFor example, Bob can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get plates for serving.\n\nOr to onion dispensers to get more onions.\n\nBut we have onions on counters.\n\nFirst, let's have Alice pick up an onion and add to pot.\n\nAt turn 41:\n\nAlice: move right to (5,1)\n\nBob: since he can interact with (2,2) to pick up onion, but let's have him do that.\n\nTurn 41:\n\n- Alice: R (move right to (5,1))\n\n- Bob: I (interact with (2,2) to pick up onion)\n\nAfter, Alice at (5,1), holding nothing.\n\nBob at (2,3), holding onion.\n\nBut Bob holding onion, he can add to a pot, but far.\n\nTurn 42:\n\nAlice at (5,1), can change orientation to up (U) to face (5,2)\n\nThen turn 43: interact to pick up onion from (5,2)\n\nBut that takes two turns to pick up.\n\nAt turn 42, after facing up, she can interact same turn? No, each turn one action.\n\nSo separate turns.\n\nShe could have moved to a position where she can interact directly, but at (5,1), she needs to face up first.\n\nTurn 42: Alice change orientation to U (face up)\n\nBob: since he is holding onion, he can move towards a pot, but far, so perhaps he can place the onion on a kitchen counter closer to the pots or something.\n\nFor example, there is kitchen counter at (2,2), but he just picked up from there, or other counters.\n\nKitchen counter at (3,2) is empty? Kitchen counters: (3,2) is listed, but not in non-empty, so probably empty.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters are only those listed with items, so (3,2) is a kitchen counter but empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) empty, etc.\n\nSo Bob can move to an empty kitchen counter and place the onion for later use.\n\nBut that might not be efficient.\n\nSince Alice is near, and pots need onions, Bob can go to an onion dispenser to get more, but he is holding one, so he needs to add it first or place it.\n\nLet's have Alice add to pot quickly.\n\nAlice at (4,1) initially, she can move left to (3,1) in one move.\n\nThen from (3,1), she can face down and interact to add to pot (3,0), but she is holding nothing, so she needs an onion first.\n\nSo she must get an onion before adding.\n\nSo moving to (3,1) first is not useful without item.\n\nSo better to go to (5,1) and get onion from (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, there is onion at (6,0), but (6,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, access from adjacent.\n\n(6,0) at (6,0), adjacent empty tiles: above (6,1), left (5,0) kitchen counter not empty, right (7,0) kitchen counter not empty, below out of bound.\n\nSo only (6,1) can access (6,0).\n\n(6,1) not listed, empty.\n\nAlice at (4,1) can move to (5,1), then to (6,1), then face down to interact with (6,0) to pick up onion, but (6,0) has onion, so she can pick up.\n\nBut (5,2) is closer to (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), (5,2) is above, so better to get from (5,2).\n\nSo back to plan.\n\nTurn 41:\n\n- Alice: R (move to (5,1))\n\n- Bob: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nAfter, Alice at (5,1), holding nothing, orientation? She was facing left, after move right, she is at (5,1), and moving right changes position and orientation to right, I think.\n\nRule: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\nSo when she moves, her orientation changes to the direction she moved.\n\nSo from (4,1) facing left, move right to (5,1), now at (5,1), facing right.\n\nSimilarly, change orientation action only if not moving.\n\nSo at (5,1), facing right.\n\nTo interact with (5,2) above, she needs to face up.\n\nTurn 42:\n\nAlice: U (change orientation to up) to face (5,2)\n\nBob: now holding onion, at (2,3), facing down (since he interacted, didn't move, so orientation down).\n\nBob can move towards the pots or do something else.\n\nSince far, he can move to (3,3) for example.\n\nTurn 42: Bob move east to (3,3)  (assuming (3,3) empty)\n\nAfter, Bob at (3,3), holding onion, facing east? Move east changes orientation to east.\n\nTurn 43:\n\nAlice at (5,1), facing up, so she can interact (I) to pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nAfter, Alice holding onion, (5,2) now empty.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing east, holding onion.\n\nBob can move south to (3,2) not possible, so move east to (4,3) if empty.\n\n(4,3) empty.\n\nMove to (4,3), facing east.\n\nTurn 44:\n\nAlice holding onion, at (5,1), facing up.\n\nShe needs to go to a pot to add onion.\n\nNearest pot is (4,0) or (3,0).\n\n(4,0) is below (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), she can move west to (4,1), which is empty.\n\nAt (4,1), she can face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nBut she needs to move and change orientation.\n\nTurn 44: Alice move west (L) to (4,1), now at (4,1), facing west (left).\n\nBob at (4,3), facing east, holding onion.\n\nBob can move south to (4,2) not possible, so move east to (5,3) or west to (3,3), or north to (4,4) not.\n\nMove to (5,3) east, facing east.\n\nTurn 45:\n\nAlice at (4,1), facing left.\n\nTo interact with (4,0) below, she needs to face down.\n\nSo change orientation to down (D).\n\nThen she can interact next turn to add onion.\n\nBob at (5,3), facing east, holding onion.\n\nBob can move south to (5,2) not possible, so move to (6,3) or down to (5,2) not, so move east to (6,3) if empty.\n\n(6,3) empty, move to (6,3), facing east.\n\nBut he is not closer to pot.\n\nBob should drop the onion or something.\n\nSince Alice is adding onion to pot, and Bob is far, he can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get plates for serving.\n\nOr to an onion dispenser to get more onions for other pot.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nAfter Alice faces down, turn 46: Alice interact to add onion to pot (4,0).\n\nNow pot (4,0) has one onion.\n\nSimilarly, we need to add more.\n\nBut H is not specified, so we need to plan for several turns.\n\nSince soup cooks in 5 turns, we need to fill the pot with 3 onions.\n\nEach addition takes turns.\n\nAlso, after cooking, need to serve with plate.\n\nSo let's think about the sequence.\n\nFirst, for pot (4,0), Alice added one onion at turn 46.\n\nWe need two more onions.\n\nSimilarly, pot (3,0) is empty.\n\nBob is at (6,3), holding onion, which he can add to a pot, but far.\n\nHe can place the onion on a kitchen counter near the pots.\n\nFor example, kitchen counter at (4,2) is empty, so he can go there.\n\n(4,2) at (4,2), adjacent empty tiles: below (4,1), above (4,3), left (3,2), right (5,2) etc.\n\n(4,1) is empty, Alice may be there.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo interact with (4,2), from (4,1) facing up, or from (4,3) facing down, etc.\n\nBob at (6,3), he can move to (5,3), then to (5,2) not, so to (4,3), then from (4,3) face down to interact with (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is kitchen counter, so he can place the onion if empty.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut it might be better to have Bob go to the other area.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, Alice can get another onion to add to the pot.\n\nFor example, at (6,0) there is onion on kitchen counter.\n\nAlice after adding onion, at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to (6,1) to access (6,0).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nThen pick up onion from (6,0).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's outline the actions for a few turns.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob, I should focus on Alice's actions, and suggest what Bob should do for coordination.\n\nThe answer format is only for Alice's actions, I think.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the answer format shows only turns with actions, so probably only Alice's actions.\n\nLet me check the answer format.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nAnd \"each action for Alice\".\n\nSo I need to provide only Alice's actions, but to maximize reward, we need to coordinate with Bob, so in the plan, we assume Bob is cooperating.\n\nIn the description, it says \"help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we can suggest Bob's actions in text, but the sequence is for Alice.\n\nFor the box, only Alice's actions.\n\nSo for the sequence, I provide Alice's actions, and in text, describe what Bob should do.\n\nBut for now, let's list Alice's actions.\n\nFrom turn 41:\n\nAlice at (4,1) facing left, holding nothing.\n\nTo get an onion, she should move to (5,1) to access (5,2).\n\nAction: R (move right to (5,1))\n\nThen at (5,1), she needs to face up to interact with (5,2).\n\nAction at turn 42: U (change orientation to up)\n\nThen turn 43: I (interact to pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to go to a pot to add it.\n\nNearest pot is (4,0) or (3,0).\n\n(4,0) is closer.\n\nFrom (5,1), move west to (4,1).\n\nAction at turn 44: L (move left to (4,1))\n\nNow at (4,1), facing west (left) after move.\n\nTo interact with (4,0) below, she needs to face down.\n\nAction at turn 45: D (change orientation to down)\n\nThen turn 46: I (interact to add onion to pot (4,0))\n\nNow pot (4,0) has one onion.\n\nAlice at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nNow, she can get another onion to add to the same pot or to the other.\n\nThere is onion at (6,0) on counter.\n\nShe can go to (6,1) to access it.\n\nFrom (4,1), move right to (5,1), then to (6,1).\n\nAction turn 47: R (move right to (5,1))  -- at (5,1), facing right.\n\nThen turn 48: R (move right to (6,1))  -- at (6,1), facing right.\n\nThen she needs to face down to interact with (6,0).\n\nAction turn 49: D (change orientation to down)\n\nThen turn 50: I (interact to pick up onion from (6,0))\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can go back to pot (4,0) to add another onion.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nAction turn 51: L (move left to (5,1))  -- facing left\n\nTurn 52: L (move left to (4,1))  -- facing left\n\nThen at (4,1), facing left, need to face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nAction turn 53: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 54: I (add onion to pot (4,0))  -- now two onions.\n\nSimilarly, for the third onion, she can get from another counter, e.g. (5,4) or (2,2), but (2,2) is far.\n\n(5,4) has onion, at (5,4).\n\nAccess from (5,3) or (6,4) etc.\n\nFrom (4,1), she can go to (5,1), then to (5,2) not, so to (6,1), then to (6,2) if empty.\n\n(6,2) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (6,2) she can go to (6,3) or to (5,2) not, so to (6,3), then to (6,4) kitchen counter not empty, not walkable.\n\nTo access (5,4), from (5,3) facing down, or (4,4) onion dispenser not, or (6,4) not.\n\n(5,4) at (5,4), adjacent empty tiles: above (5,5) out of bound, below (5,3), left (4,4) onion dispenser not empty, right (6,4) kitchen counter not empty.\n\nSo only from (5,3) facing down.\n\n(5,3) not listed, empty.\n\nAlice can go to (5,3) then face down to interact with (5,4).\n\nBut from current position, after adding second onion, at (4,1), it would take many moves.\n\nBob can be getting the onions.\n\nSince we need to start cooking, with two onions in pot, but it needs three to start cooking.\n\nRule: \"Pot: Add ingredient (if pot is not full and player is holding ingredient) → cooks automatically at 3 ingredients.\"\n\nSo only when third ingredient is added, cooking starts.\n\nWith two onions, not cooking.\n\nSo we need three in a pot.\n\nAlice can add the third onion to (4,0) or to another pot.\n\nBut let's assume Bob is getting the third onion.\n\nFor Alice, after adding the second onion, she can go to another task.\n\nBut for the sequence, let's plan for 10 turns or so.\n\nAlso, after cooking, need to serve.\n\nCooking time 5 turns for onion soup.\n\nBut we have only one recipe.\n\nFirst, let's fill a pot.\n\nBob can be filling the other pot.\n\nFor example, at turn 41, Bob picks up onion from (2,2).\n\nThen he can go to (3,1) to add to (3,0) pot.\n\nBut as before, it takes many moves.\n\nShortest path to (3,1): from (2,3) to (1,3), to (1,2), to (1,1), to (2,1), to (3,1) 5 moves.\n\nThen at (3,1), face down, interact to add onion.\n\nSo many turns.\n\nHe can go to onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4) to get new onion closer to pots.\n\nBut he is holding one, so he needs to place it or add it.\n\nAt turn 41, Bob interacts to pick up onion from (2,2), so now holding.\n\nThen he can move to (3,4) onion dispenser, but (3,4) is not walkable, so from adjacent.\n\n(3,4) at (3,4), adjacent empty tiles: below (3,3), above out of bound, left (2,4) kitchen counter not empty, right (4,4) onion dispenser not empty.\n\nSo only from (3,3) facing up.\n\nBob at (2,3) can move to (3,3), then face up to interact with (3,4) to get another onion, but he is holding one, so he can't grab.\n\nHe can place the onion on a counter first.\n\nFor example, at (3,2) kitchen counter empty, so he can go to (3,3), then face down to interact with (3,2) to place onion.\n\nThen he is empty, can go to (3,3) face up to interact with (3,4) to get new onion.\n\nThen with that onion, go to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nStill many turns.\n\nPerhaps for efficiency, Alice focuses on one pot, and Bob on the other or on plates.\n\nBut Alice is closer to both pots.\n\nLet's list Alice's actions for the next 10 turns to add two onions to a pot and start cooking.\n\nFrom turn 41:\n\nTurn 41: R (move to (5,1))\n\nTurn 42: U (face up to interact with (5,2))\n\nTurn 43: I (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nTurn 44: L (move left to (4,1))\n\nTurn 45: D (face down to interact with (4,0))\n\nTurn 46: I (add onion to pot (4,0))  -- pot has 1 onion\n\nNow holding nothing.\n\nGet another onion. Nearest is at (6,0) or (5,4) or others.\n\n(6,0) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,1), move right to (5,1) then to (6,1).\n\nTurn 47: R (move to (5,1))  -- facing right\n\nTurn 48: R (move to (6,1))  -- facing right\n\nTurn 49: D (face down to interact with (6,0))\n\nTurn 50: I (pick up onion from (6,0))\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nGo back to (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nTurn 51: L (move left to (5,1))  -- facing left\n\nTurn 52: L (move left to (4,1))  -- facing left\n\nTurn 53: D (face down)  -- already at (4,1), facing left, need face down\n\nTurn 54: I (add onion to pot (4,0))  -- now 2 onions\n\nPot has 2 onions, not cooking yet.\n\nFor third onion, she can get from (5,4) or (2,2), but far.\n\nOr Bob can add it.\n\nBut for Alice, she can go to (5,4).\n\nFrom (4,1), to (5,1), to (6,1), to (6,2), to (6,3), to (5,3), then face down to interact with (5,4).\n\nTurn 55: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 56: R to (6,1) but at (6,1) after turn 50, but after turn 54 at (4,1), so turn 55: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 56: R to (6,1)? From (5,1) move right to (6,1), but (6,1) is where she was, but she can move.\n\nAfter turn 54 at (4,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 55: R to (5,1) facing right\n\nTurn 56: U to (5,2) not possible, (5,2) occupied, so move to (6,1) if empty, but from (5,1) to (6,1) move right.\n\n(6,1) empty, so turn 56: R to (6,1) facing right\n\nThen to (6,2), if empty.\n\n(6,2) not listed, empty, so turn 57: U to (6,2)?

Not adjacent, only cardinal, so move to (6,1) then to (6,2) then to (6,3) then to (5,3).\n\nLong.\n\nFrom (4,1) move to (3,1), then to (3,2) not, so to (3,3), then to (4,3).\n\nTurn 47: L to (3,1) facing left (from (4,1) facing down? After turn 46, at (4,1) facing down after interact.\n\nOrientation after interact: she was at (4,1) facing down, interacted, so still facing down.\n\nTurn 47: L move left to (3,1) facing left\n\nThen at (3,1), facing left.\n\nThen move up to (3,2) not possible, so move to (3,3) if empty, turn 48: U to (3,2) not, so change orientation or move.\n\nMove north to (3,2) not possible, so she can change orientation to up, but (3,2) occupied, no interact.\n\nMove to (3,3) by moving north, but (3,2) blocked, so from (3,1) move to (3,0) not, or to (2,1) west.\n\n(2,1) empty, move west to (2,1) facing west.\n\nThen to (2,2) not, so to (1,1), etc.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the fastest way is to use the onions on counters.\n\nFor the sake of planning, let's provide Alice's actions for the first few turns to start the process.\n\nThen for serving, need plates.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can get plates.\n\nBob is at (2,3), closer to (0,2) than Alice.\n\nBob can go to (0,2) to get plates.\n\nFor example, at turn 41, Bob interacts to pick up onion from (2,2), but then he is holding, so he can place it or deliver.\n\nBut let's define Alice's actions.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide a sequence for Alice to add one onion to the pot and then get ready for more.\n\nTurn 41: R  # move to (5,1)\n\nTurn 42: U  # face up\n\nTurn 43: I  # pick up onion from (5,2)\n\nTurn 44: L  # move to (4,1)\n\nTurn 45: D  # face down\n\nTurn 46: I  # add onion to pot (4,0)\n\nThen she is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nNext, she can go to another onion or to plate dispenser.\n\nBut plate dispenser far.\n\nOr she can stay.\n\nBut to continue, turn 47: S  # stay for now, but not productive.\n\nMove to (3,1) to be near other pot.\n\nTurn 47: L  # move left to (3,1) facing left\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face down to interact with (3,0) but holding nothing.\n\nSo she needs to get an onion.\n\nThere is onion at (2,2), but (2,2) is at (2,2), access from (2,1) or (2,3) or (1,2) or (3,2).\n\n(2,1) empty, (2,3) has Bob or not.\n\nBob may be there.\n\nAssume Bob is moving.\n\nFor Alice, from (3,1), she can move to (2,1) west, then face up to interact with (2,2) if onion still there.\n\nBut at turn 41, Bob picked up the onion from (2,2), so it's empty now.\n\nAfter Bob interacts at turn 41, (2,2) is empty.\n\nSo no onion there.\n\nOther onions at (5,4) or (6,0) etc.\n\nSo Alice can go to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut I think for the sequence, I'll stop at turn 46 for now.\n\nPerhaps the plan can be to have Alice add an onion to start, then Bob adds another, but for Alice's actions, we can have her add one and then get a plate or something.\n\nLet's include getting a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice at (4,1), far.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): many moves.\n\nBob is closer, at (2,3), so he should get plates.\n\nFor Alice, after adding onion, she can get another onion for the pot.\n\nBut let's define the sequence for 10 turns.\n\nTurn 41: R  # to (5,1)\n\nTurn 42: U  # face up\n\nTurn 43: I  # pick up onion from (5,2)\n\nTurn 44: L  # to (4,1)\n\nTurn 45: D  # face down\n\nTurn 46: I  # add to pot (4,0)\n\nTurn 47: R  # to (5,1)\n\nTurn 48: R  # to (6,1)\n\nTurn 49: D  # face down\n\nTurn 50: I  # pick up onion from (6,0)\n\nThen she has onion, can add to pot.\n\nTurn 51: L  # to (5,1)\n\nTurn 52: L  # to (4,1)\n\nTurn 53: D  # face down (assuming she was facing left, need to face down)\n\nAfter move left to (4,1), facing left, so turn 53: D to face down\n\nTurn 54: I  # add to pot (4,0), now 2 onions.\n\nThen for third, she can go to (5,4), but many turns.\n\nSo for H=14 turns, she can have two onions in pot.\n\nBut not started cooking.\n\nI think it's acceptable for the plan.\n\nThen Bob can add the third or get plates.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide Alice's actions.\n\nAlso, for the pot to cook, after third onion added, it cooks for 5 turns, then serve.\n\nBut with this, at turn 54, two onions, so not cooking.\n\nIf Bob adds the third at some point.\n\nFor example, at turn 41, Bob picks up onion, then he can go to (3,1) and add to (3,0) or to (4,0).\n\nBut to (4,0), he needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nAlice is there sometimes.\n\nBut they can coordinate.\n\nAssume that Bob adds the third onion to (4,0) at some turn.\n\nThen cooking starts.\n\nAfter 5 turns, soup cooked, then need to serve with plate.\n\nPlayer with plate can serve at serving counter (7,2).\n\nOr at the pot, with plate, can serve soup from pot.\n\nRule: \"Pot: Serve soup (if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup).\"\n\nSo they can serve directly from pot with plate.\n\nNo need to move soup to serving counter.\n\nServing counter is for delivering, but from pot, they can serve if holding plate.\n\nRule: \"Interact with Pot: Serve soup (if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup).\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo after soup cooked, player with plate can interact with pot to serve for reward.\n\nSimilarly, at serving counter, if holding soup in plate, can deliver.\n\nBut for pot, they can serve directly.\n\nSo efficient.\n\nSo we need plates.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBob can get plates.\n\nFor example, at turn 41, Bob interacts to pick up onion from (2,2), but then he holding onion, so he can place it on a counter or add to pot.\n\nBut far, so perhaps he goes to plate dispenser first.\n\nAt turn 41, Bob can move towards (0,2).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3) to (0,3), then to (0,2).\n\n(0,3) is kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (0,3), so not walkable.\n\n(0,3) kitchen counter, not empty? Non-empty only specified, but (0,3) is a kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\nAccess to (0,2) plate dispenser.\n\n(0,2) at (0,2), adjacent empty tiles: above (0,3) kitchen counter not empty, below (0,1) kitchen counter not empty, left out of bound, right (1,2) if empty.\n\n(1,2) not listed, empty.\n\nSo only from (1,2) facing left.\n\nBob at (2,3) can move west to (1,3) if empty, then south to (1,2), then face left to interact with (0,2) to get plate.\n\nTurn 41: Bob move west to (1,3)\n\nTurn 42: move south to (1,2) facing south\n\nThen turn 43: change orientation to left (L) to face west\n\nTurn 44: interact to get plate.\n\nThen he can carry plate.\n\n Etc.\n\nBut for Alice, I'll provide the sequence as above.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 41 to turn 50:\n\nTurn 41: R\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: L\nTurn 45: D\nTurn 46: I\nTurn 47: R\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I\n\nThen she has an onion from (6,0), at (6,1), facing down.\n\nThen she can add to pot.\n\nTurn 51: L to (5,1)\nTurn 52: L to (4,1)\nTurn 53: D (face down)\nTurn 54: I (add to pot)\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 50 or so.\n\nSince H not specified, perhaps 10 turns.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 41: R\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: L\nTurn 45: D\nTurn 46: I\nTurn 47: R\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I\n\nThen at turn 50, she picks up onion from (6,0), so she can then add to pot in next turns.\n\nBut for the sequence, this is a start.\n\nTo make it shorter, she can add one onion and then prepare for serving.\n\nBut I think this is fine.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in *Overcooked*, Alice and Bob must coordinate to efficiently fill the pots with ingredients (onions, in this case, since tomatoes are unavailable), allow the soup to cook, and deliver it using plates. Given the current game state at turn 41, the only recipe is onion soup (3 onions, 5-turn cook time, 20 reward). Pots are empty, and multiple onions are available on kitchen counters. Alice is positioned near the pots and can start filling them, while Bob should focus on gathering additional onions or plates to support the process.\n\n### Key Observations and Coordination Plan:\n- **Pots**: Two pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Adding 3 onions to a pot starts cooking automatically. Cooking takes 5 turns, after which the soup can be served with a plate.\n- **Onion Availability**: Onions are on kitchen counters at (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), and (2,2). Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) can provide more onions if needed, but using counter onions saves time.\n- **Plate Dispenser**: At (0,2). Bob is closer to this and should handle plate retrieval once the soup is cooking.\n- **Serving**: Soup can be served directly from the pot when a player holds a clean plate and the soup is cooked. Serving counter at (7,2) is for delivery, but direct pot serving is more efficient.\n- **Alice's Position**: At (4,1), facing left, holding nothing. She is close to pot (4,0) and can quickly access onions at (5,2) or (6,0).\n- **Bob's Position**: At (2,3), facing down, holding nothing. He can pick up the onion at (2,2) and either add it to a pot or place it on a counter for Alice. He should then get plates from (0,2) or gather more onions.\n- **Action History**: Not critical for future planning, but Alice's recent moves (R, D, I, L, L) placed her near (4,0), and Bob's (U, I, L, D, I) suggests he was interacting with (2,2), so he should pick up that onion now.\n\n### Recommended Actions for Alice (Turns 41 to 50):\nAlice will focus on filling pot (4,0) with onions from nearby counters. Her sequence:\n- **Turns 41-43**: Move to (5,1), face up, and pick up onion from (5,2).\n- **Turns 44-46**: Move to (4,1), face down, and add onion to pot (4,0). Pot now has 1 onion.\n- **Turns 47-50**: Move to (6,1), face down, and pick up onion from (6,0). She now holds an onion for the next addition.\n\nAfter turn 50, Alice should add this onion to pot (4,0) (moving back to (4,1) and interacting), bringing it to 2 onions. Bob should add the third onion to start cooking. Meanwhile, Bob should get plates from (0,2) to be ready for serving after cooking.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (10 turns):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: R \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: I \\\\\nTurn 44: L \\\\\nTurn 45: D \\\\\nTurn 46: I \\\\\nTurn 47: R \\\\\nTurn 48: R \\\\\nTurn 49: D \\\\\nTurn 50: I\n}\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- **Turn 41**: Bob should interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2). He now holds an onion.\n- **Subsequent Turns**: Bob should move toward pot (4,0) or (3,0) to add his onion (e.g., via (3,3) and (4,3) to reach (4,1) or (3,1)). Since this is slow, he should prioritize adding to pot (4,0) if Alice has only 1-2 onions. After adding, he should go to (0,2) to get plates:\n  - Move west to (1,3), then south to (1,2), face left, and interact to get a plate.\n- **Cooking and Serving**: Once pot (4,0) has 3 onions (e.g., from Bob or Alice), cooking starts. After 5 turns, Bob (or Alice) can serve with a plate. Alice can then fill the second pot (3,0) for more soup.\n\nThis plan starts soup cooking quickly and prepares for serving, with an estimated reward of 20 within 10-15 turns. Adjust based on Bob's actions for optimal teamwork.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the game state at turn 45. Alice is at (4,1) facing right, holding nothing. Bob is at (3,3) facing down, holding one onion. There are kitchen counters with onions at (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), and (2,2). The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), both empty. The serving counter is at (7,2), and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). Onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). No tomato dispensers, so we only have onions to work with.\n\nThe recipe is for 3 onions, which takes 5 turns to cook and gives a reward of 20. Since there are no tomatoes, we can only make onion soup.\n\nAlice and Bob need to collaborate to make and deliver onion soup. Since pots need 3 ingredients to start cooking, and we have onions available, we should fill a pot with 3 onions.\n\nBob is already holding one onion, so he can contribute that. There are also onions on kitchen counters that we can use.\n\nLet me sketch the grid for clarity. The grid is from (0,0) to (7,4) I assume, based on the tile positions.\n\nList of all tile positions:\n\n- Kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\n- Also, empty tiles for walking.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), Bob at (3,3).\n\nAlice is holding nothing, so she can pick up items. Bob is holding one onion, so he can place it into a pot or on a counter.\n\nThe pots are empty, so we need to get onions into one of the pots. Since there are onions on counters, we might not need to go to dispensers yet.\n\nFirst, let's get onions to a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Both are on the bottom row.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), which is above (4,0). Since she's facing right, and (4,0) is below her? Positions: (4,1) is at row 1, column 4. Assuming x increases right, y increases up? Let's check the move actions: L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y), U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So y increases up, so (0,0) is bottom-left, I think.\n\nConfirm with tile positions. For example, pots at (3,0) and (4,0), which are on y=0, so bottom row. Serving counter at (7,2), etc.\n\nSo Alice at (4,1) – that's row 1, column 4. Below her is (4,0), which is a pot. She is facing right, so not facing the pot. To interact with the pot at (4,0), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (4,1) are: left (3,1), right (5,1), up (4,2), down (4,0).\n\n(4,0) is directly below, so it is adjacent. To face it, she needs to face down.\n\nCurrently, she is facing right, so she needs to change orientation to down to interact with the pot.\n\nBut the pot is empty, and she is holding nothing, so if she interacts, she can't add an ingredient. She needs to be holding an onion to add to the pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He is facing down. Adjacent tiles: (3,3) has left (2,3), right (4,3), up (3,4), down (3,2).\n\n(3,4) is an onion dispenser, but he's holding an onion already, so he might not need to interact with dispenser. He can go to a pot to add the onion.\n\nThe pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are far from him. He needs to move down.\n\nAlso, there are onions on counters: at (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2). (6,0) is a kitchen counter with onion, and (6,0) is near the pots since y=0.\n\n(6,0) is adjacent to (5,0) and (7,0), both kitchen counters, but (5,0) is a counter, not a pot. Pots are (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nTo get onions to a pot, we can use the onions on counters or go to dispensers.\n\nSince Bob has an onion, he should add it to a pot. But he is at (3,3), pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), so he needs to move down to y=0.\n\nHe can go down to (3,2), then to (3,1), then to (3,0) or something.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can pick up an onion from a counter and add to pot.\n\nLet's see the positions of onions on counters:\n\n- (5,2): onion on kitchen counter\n\n- (5,4): onion on kitchen counter\n\n- (6,0): onion on kitchen counter\n\n- (2,2): onion on kitchen counter\n\nAlice is at (4,1). The closest onion might be at (5,2)? (5,2) is at row 2, col 5.\n\nFrom (4,1), she can go right to (5,1), then up to (5,2), but (5,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter or anything, so it should be empty and walkable.\n\nTile types: kitchen counters are listed, so other tiles should be empty unless dispensers or pots.\n\n(5,1) is not in kitchen counter list, so it should be empty. Similarly, (4,2) is a kitchen counter, but it has no item, I think? The non-empty kitchen counters are specified: (5,2) has onion, etc. So (4,2) is a kitchen counter but empty, since not listed as non-empty.\n\nThe non-empty ones are: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2) all have onions.\n\nSo Alice at (4,1) can move to (5,1) (right), then to (5,2) (up). At (5,2), she can interact to pick up the onion if she is facing (5,2) and empty-handed.\n\n(5,2) is a kitchen counter, so to interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFrom (5,1), if she moves up to (5,2), she would be on (5,2), but players can only be on empty tiles, and (5,2) is a kitchen counter, which is not walkable? Important point.\n\nTile types: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" Dispensers, Pots, etc. are not walkable, I assume. \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But \"non-empty tiles\" might mean tiles with objects, like dispensers, counters, etc., but counters can be walked on? I need to check.\n\nFrom the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And \"non-empty\" probably means tiles that have objects on them or are interactable, like dispensers, pots, counters.\n\nSpecifically, for kitchen counters, it says \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" But can players walk on them?\n\nThe rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And \"non-empty\" might refer to tiles that are not empty tiles.\n\nFrom the description: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" Then Dispensers, Pots, etc., are not empty, so they are not walkable.\n\nAlso, for interaction, \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo, players must stand on an empty tile adjacent to the target tile to interact; they cannot stand on the tile itself if it's not empty.\n\nFor example, for a kitchen counter, player stands on an adjacent empty tile and faces the counter to interact.\n\nSimilarly for pots, etc.\n\nIn this case, for (5,2), which is a kitchen counter with an onion, Alice can stand on (5,1) or (4,2) or (5,3) or (6,2), but (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so not walkable? (4,2) is listed as a kitchen counter, so not empty, not walkable.\n\nList of kitchen counters: (4,2) is one of them, so it cannot be walked on.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) cannot be walked on.\n\nSo to interact with (5,2), Alice needs to be on an adjacent empty tile: possible positions: left (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter, not empty. Right (6,2) – (6,2) is not listed as anything, so should be empty tile. Up (5,3) – not listed, empty. Down (5,1) – not listed, empty.\n\nSo (5,2) has adjacent empty tiles: (4,2) is not empty, it's a counter, so not walkable. Adjacent tiles: north (5,3), south (5,1), east (6,2), west (4,2). But (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so not walkable. Therefore, only (5,3), (5,1), and (6,2) are possible positions to interact from, assuming they are empty.\n\n(5,3) and (6,2) might be empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly, for other counters.\n\nBack to Alice at (4,1). She can move right to (5,1), which should be empty. From (5,1), she is adjacent to (5,2) south side? (5,1) is below (5,2), so if she faces up, she can interact with (5,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, she could go to other places.\n\nBut (5,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up.\n\nThen she can take it to a pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3) with an onion. He can go to a pot to add it.\n\nNow, which pot to use? Both are empty, so either is fine. Let's use (4,0) since Alice is closer.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), so (4,0) is directly below.\n\nBut she needs an onion first.\n\nBob is at (3,3), he can go down to (3,2), then to (3,1), then to (3,0) to add to pot (3,0).\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter? (3,2) is listed as a kitchen counter, so not walkable. (3,2) is a position, and it's in the list, so Bob cannot walk to (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,3), adjacent down is (3,2), but (3,2) is a kitchen counter, not empty, so he cannot move down to (3,2). He can only move to empty tiles or through empty tiles.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3): left (2,3), right (4,3), up (3,4), down (3,2) but (3,2) not empty, so cannot move down.\n\n(2,3): is it empty? Not listed as kitchen counter or other, so probably empty.\n\n(4,3): similarly, not listed, empty.\n\n(3,4): onion dispenser, not empty.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) or up to (3,4), but (3,4) is dispenser, not walkable, so only left or right.\n\nHe is facing down, but to move, he can change orientation.\n\nAction: he can move or change orientation.\n\nHe can change orientation to left or right, then move.\n\nBut to go down, he needs to reach y=0.\n\nHe can go to (2,3), then down to (2,2), but (2,2) is a kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\n(2,2) is occupied, so he cannot move there.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move down? (2,3) to (2,2) is down, but (2,2) not empty.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3), he can move down to (4,2), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\nSo Bob cannot go directly down from (3,3) because (3,2) is blocked.\n\nHe needs to go left or right and then find a way down.\n\nFor example, go left to (2,3). (2,3) should be empty tile.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move down? South is (2,2), not empty. East is (3,3), north is (2,4)? (2,4) is a kitchen counter, listed, not empty. West is (1,3)? Not listed, probably empty.\n\nKitchen counters include (2,4), so (2,4) not empty.\n\nSo from (2,3), he can move west to (1,3) or east to (3,3) or north to (2,4) not possible, south not possible. So only west to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen from (1,3), he can move south to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, should be empty? Kitchen counters include (2,2), (3,2), etc., but (1,2) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (1,2), he can move south to (1,1)? (1,1) not listed, empty. Then to (1,0), but (1,0) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\n(1,0) is a kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\nTo reach the pots, he needs to go to a row where he can access the bottom.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nThe row above, y=1, has positions like (3,1), (4,1), etc.\n\n(3,1) not listed, should be empty.\n\n(4,1) is where Alice is, but she might move.\n\nFrom Bob's position, he can go to (4,3) first.\n\nFrom (3,3), move right to (4,3), which should be empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So cannot.\n\nMove south not possible. North to (4,4)? (4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable. East to (5,3)? Not listed, empty. West to (3,3).\n\nSo from (4,3), he can move east to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move south to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable. North to (5,4)? (5,4) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable. East to (6,3)? Not listed, empty. West to (4,3).\n\nSo only east to (6,3).\n\nFrom (6,3), move south to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, should be empty? Then from (6,2), he can interact with (6,1) or something, but we need to get to y=0.\n\n(6,2) to (6,1) down, (6,1) not listed, empty, then to (6,0), but (6,0) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable, so he cannot move to (6,0).\n\nTo reach a pot, he needs to be at an adjacent empty tile.\n\nFor pot at (3,0), adjacent tiles: north (3,1), south not exist or wall, east (4,0), west (2,0).\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, (3,1) should be empty, (4,0) is pot.\n\nSo for (3,0), player can stand on (3,1) and face down to interact.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), stand on (4,1) and face down.\n\n(4,1) is where Alice is now.\n\nBob is at (3,3), so to reach (3,1), he needs to go through (2,3) or (4,3), but as above, it's a detour.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move left to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1) or something.\n\n(1,1) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (1,1), he can move east to (2,1)? (2,1) not listed, empty. Then from (2,1), he can move south to (2,0)? (2,0) kitchen counter, not empty. Or east to (3,1), which is empty.\n\nThen from (3,1), he can interact with pot at (3,0) by facing down.\n\nSimilarly, he could go to (4,1) for (4,0).\n\nBut (4,1) might be occupied by Alice.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, Bob could place his onion on a counter first, but that might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Bob is at (3,3) facing down, but he can't move down. He can change orientation or move.\n\nHe can interact with (3,4) if he faces up, but (3,4) is onion dispenser, and he is holding an onion, so he can't grab another; he needs to place it first.\n\nOr, he could place the onion on a kitchen counter if there's an empty one.\n\nThere are kitchen counters with onions, but some might be empty.\n\nFor example, (4,2) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty, so it might be empty.\n\nThe non-empty kitchen counters are only the ones listed: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2) have onions. Others are empty or have nothing.\n\nSo (4,2) is empty, so Bob could go to (4,2) and place his onion, but he can't walk to (4,2) because it's not empty tile; it's a counter.\n\nTo interact with (4,2), he needs to be on an adjacent empty tile, like (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), or (5,2).\n\n(4,1) is occupied by Alice, (4,3) is above, (3,2) is counter, (5,2) is counter.\n\nSo possible: from (4,3), he can face south to interact with (4,2), but he is not at (4,3) yet.\n\nLet's focus on Alice first, as she is closer to the pot.\n\nAlice at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nShe can move to pick up an onion from a counter.\n\nClosest onion: at (5,2) or (2,2) or (5,4) or (6,0).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is close. From (4,1), she can move right to (5,1), which is empty. From (5,1), she is adjacent to (5,2) south side, so if she faces up, she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nThen she has an onion.\n\nThen she can go to the pot at (4,0). From (5,1), she can move down? (5,1) to (5,0) down, but (5,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So she can move left to (4,1), then from (4,1) she is above (4,0), so if she faces down, she can interact to add the onion to the pot.\n\nSimilarly, she could go to other pots.\n\nSo sequence for Alice: from (4,1), move right to (5,1). Then change orientation to up (since (5,2) is north), then interact to pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nThen she is holding onion. Then move left to (4,1). Then change orientation to down (to face (4,0)), then interact to add onion to pot.\n\nPot at (4,0) now has one onion.\n\nBob has an onion, so he should add it to the same pot or another.\n\nBut pots need three onions, so we need two more.\n\nThere are other onions on counters.\n\nBob is at (3,3) with onion.\n\nHe can go to (4,1) to add to pot, but Alice might be there.\n\nFirst, let's get Bob to add his onion.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move right to (4,3), empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move east to (5,3), empty.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move south to (5,2)? Not possible, (5,2) not walkable. Instead, he can go to (5,1) or other.\n\nHe needs to reach (4,1) or (3,1) to interact with pot.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? Not possible. So to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (6,1), then to (5,1) or (7,1), but (7,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(6,2) to (6,1) down, (6,1) empty, then from (6,1) he can move west to (5,1), which is empty.\n\nThen from (5,1), he is adjacent to (4,1) west? (5,1) to (4,1) is left, so he can move to (4,1) if empty.\n\nBut (4,1) might be occupied.\n\nFrom (5,1), he can face west to interact with (4,1)? (4,1) is an empty tile, not a counter, so he can't interact with it; interaction is for non-empty tiles like counters, pots, etc.\n\nTo add to pot, he needs to be at a tile adjacent to the pot and facing it.\n\nFor pot at (4,0), he needs to be at (4,1) or (3,0) or (5,0) or (4,-1) invalid, so only (4,1) north, or (3,0) west, (5,0) east.\n\n(3,0) and (5,0) are counters or pots; (3,0) is pot, (5,0) is kitchen counter, so not walkable. So only possible from (4,1) facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (3,0), from (3,1) facing down.\n\nSo Bob needs to be at (4,1) or (3,1) to add to pot.\n\n(3,1) is empty, as not listed.\n\nBob can go to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can go left to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\n(2,1) to (3,1) east.\n\nFrom (3,1), he can face down to interact with pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, he could go to (4,1) for (4,0).\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nSince Alice is at (4,1), she might move, so Bob can go to (3,1).\n\nFirst, for Alice to add one onion to (4,0).\n\nThen we need two more onions.\n\nBob can add his at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nBut to start cooking, we need three in one pot.\n\nSo better to put all in one pot.\n\nLet's use pot at (4,0).\n\nAfter Alice adds one, it has one onion.\n\nBob can add his to the same pot.\n\nBut he needs to be at (4,1).\n\nAlice is at (4,1) now, but after she adds the onion, she might move away.\n\nSimilarly, there are other onions.\n\nAlso, cooking takes 5 turns, then we need to serve with a plate.\n\nBut first, fill the pot.\n\nLet's plan the sequence step by step.\n\nTurn t1=45.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nFirst, move to get onion from (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move right to (5,1). Action: R\n\nThen, at (5,1), she needs to face up to interact with (5,2). So change orientation to U. Action: U (but U is move up, but to change orientation without moving, it's separate action.\n\nPlayer actions: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation, or Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) which changes orientation only if the adjacent tile is not empty? No.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThe description: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"Each player can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nFor Change Orientation, it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But it doesn't specify when it does move.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps it's: Change Orientation action changes the orientation to the specified direction, but if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, it might move? But the description says \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLet me read the original text.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means that when you perform a Change Orientation action, you only change orientation; you don't move, but if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, you might not be able to change orientation? No, it says \"no move\" meaning you don't move, but the orientation change happens regardless, I think.\n\nBut the phrase is poorly worded.\n\nPerhaps it's that for Change Orientation, you specify a direction, and if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, you move there and change orientation, but that would be the same as Move action.\n\nNo, Move action changes position and orientation to that direction.\n\nChange Orientation action only changes orientation, without moving.\n\nThe \"no move if\" part might be a mistake or misphrasing.\n\nLet me assume that Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) changes the orientation to left, right, up, or down, without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles.\n\nSimilarly, Move (L/R/U/D) moves to the adjacent tile in that direction if possible and changes orientation.\n\nFor interaction, you need to be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it.\n\nIn this case, for Alice at (5,1), to interact with (5,2) which is north, she needs to face up.\n\nSo she can use Change Orientation to U to face up.\n\nThen Interact to pick up onion.\n\nSimilarly for other actions.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\nSo back to Alice.\n\nTurn 45: Alice is at (4,1), orientation R.\n\nAction: Move R to (5,1), orientation R (since move changes position and orientation).\n\nAfter Move R, she is at (5,1), facing right.\n\nThen, to interact with (5,2) north, she needs to face up.\n\nSo she can Change Orientation to U, so now facing up.\n\nThen Interact (I) to pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nNow she is holding one onion.\n\nThen, she can go to (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (5,1), move L to (4,1), so at (4,1), facing left? Move L changes position to (4,1) and orientation to left.\n\nThen, to interact with pot at (4,0) south, she needs to face down.\n\nSo Change Orientation to D, facing down.\n\nThen Interact to add onion to pot.\n\nPot at (4,0) now has one onion.\n\nThis takes several turns.\n\nLet's list the actions for Alice.\n\nAt turn 45:\n\n- Turn 45: Move R to (5,1), now at (5,1), facing R.\n\n- Turn 46: Change orientation to U (to face up for interaction)\n\n- Turn 47: Interact to pick up onion from (5,2), now holding onion.\n\n- Turn 48: Move L to (4,1), now at (4,1), facing L (since move L changes orientation to L)\n\n- Turn 49: Change orientation to D (to face down)\n\n- Turn 50: Interact to add onion to pot at (4,0)\n\nNow pot has one onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (3,3) holding onion, orientation D.\n\nHe should add his onion to the same pot.\n\nHe needs to be at (4,1) to interact with (4,0).\n\nBut at turn 50, Alice might be at (4,1), so he needs to go there when it's free.\n\nHe can start moving now.\n\nFirst, he needs to reach (4,1) or (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is for pot at (3,0), but we are using (4,0), so better (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move right to (4,3). Action: R\n\nThen from (4,3), he can move to (4,2)? Not possible, so he needs to go around.\n\nFrom (4,3), move east to (5,3). Action: R (move right to (5,3))\n\nThen from (5,3), move south to (5,2)? Not possible, so move east to (6,3). Action: R\n\nThen from (6,3), move south to (6,2). Action: D\n\n(6,2) should be empty.\n\nThen from (6,2), move south to (6,1). Action: D\n\n(6,1) empty.\n\nThen from (6,1), move west to (5,1). Action: L\n\n(5,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nAlice was at (5,1) at turn 45-46, but she moved to (4,1) at turn 48, so at later turns, (5,1) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,1), he can move west to (4,1). Action: L\n\nBut (4,1) might have Alice.\n\nTo coordinate, Alice will be at (4,1) from turn 48 to 50, so Bob should arrive after turn 50.\n\nBob can go directly to (3,1) for pot (3,0).\n\nPot (3,0) is empty, so he can add there, but then we have two pots with one onion each, not good; we need three in one.\n\nBetter to have one pot with three onions.\n\nSo Bob should add to (4,0) after Alice.\n\nAfter Alice adds at turn 50, she can move away, then Bob can come to (4,1) and add.\n\nAlice after turn 50 is at (4,1), holding nothing, so she can go get another onion.\n\nPot has one onion, need two more.\n\nThere are onions at (5,4), (2,2), (6,0), etc.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is a kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice can go there.\n\nFirst, after adding onion, Alice is at (4,1), facing down.\n\nShe can change orientation or move.\n\nTo get another onion, she can go to (5,4) or other.\n\n(5,4) is far, or (2,2) or (6,0).\n\n(6,0) is on the bottom row, near pots.\n\n(6,0) has an onion, but it's a counter, so she can pick it up from adjacent.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), she can face down to interact with (6,0).\n\n(6,0) is south of (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, she is at (4,1), so she can go to (6,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), move right to (5,1), then to (6,1).\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) should be empty.\n\nThen at (6,1), face down, interact to pick up onion from (6,0).\n\nThen she has onion, then go to (4,1) to add to pot, but (4,1) might be used by Bob.\n\nPot at (4,0) has one, so adding another makes two.\n\nThen Bob adds his, makes three.\n\nBut Bob needs to add first or something.\n\nLet's sequence the turns.\n\nTurn 45: Alice actions as above.\n\nBut we need to plan for both, but the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob, but since it's collaboration, we might suggest Bob's actions, but the answer format is for Alice only, I think.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can include Bob's actions if needed.\n\nBut the answer format shows only actions for Alice, I think.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: a_{t1} Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1} ... }\" so it seems only for Alice.\n\nBut it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so for the plan, we can specify both, but the box might be for Alice.\n\nTo be safe, I'll plan Alice's actions, and assume Bob is controlled separately, but for coordination, we need to consider what Bob might do.\n\nSince Bob has action history, we can infer his behavior, but it's not given beyond the last few.\n\nBob's action history: I, R, U, I, D\n\nMost recent: D, then I, then U, etc.\n\nBut not clear what he did.\n\nPerhaps we can assume Bob will act rationally, but for planning, I'll focus on Alice and suggest what Bob should do.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output Alice's actions.\n\nLet's first plan Alice's actions to contribute to filling the pot.\n\nAfter Alice adds the first onion at turn 50, she can go to get another onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can add his onion to the pot.\n\nBut Bob needs to reach (4,1).\n\nFrom turn 45, Bob can start moving to (4,1) via the path.\n\nAt turn 45, Bob at (3,3), facing D.\n\nHe can move R to (4,3). Turn 45 for Bob: Move R to (4,3)\n\nThen at (4,3), he can move R to (5,3) (since east is right, Move R). Turn 46: Move R to (5,3)\n\nThen at (5,3), move R to (6,3). Turn 47: Move R to (6,3)\n\nThen at (6,3), move D to (6,2). Turn 48: Move D to (6,2)\n\nThen at (6,2), move D to (6,1). Turn 49: Move D to (6,1)\n\nThen at (6,1), move L to (5,1). Turn 50: Move L to (5,1)\n\nThen at (5,1), he can move L to (4,1), but at turn 50, Alice is at (4,1) adding onion, so (4,1) is occupied.\n\nAt turn 50, Alice is at (4,1) interacting to add onion, so after that, at turn 51, Alice moves away, then Bob can move to (4,1).\n\nAt turn 50, Alice performs Interact, so she is still at (4,1).\n\nThen at turn 51, Alice can move away, say to (5,1) or something.\n\nThen Bob can move to (4,1) at turn 51.\n\nBut Bob is at (5,1) at turn 50, so at turn 51, he can move L to (4,1) if empty.\n\nAlice can move to (5,1) at turn 51.\n\nLet's list turns.\n\nTurn 45:\n- Alice: Move R to (5,1)\n- Bob: Move R to (4,3)  (assuming Bob is also acting)\n\nBut for the plan, we need to specify Alice's actions, and Bob's if we want.\n\nSince the output is for Alice, I'll define Alice's actions for H turns, say H=10 or so.\n\nFirst, let's set H, the horizon. Not specified, so let's say for 10 turns, to fill the pot and start cooking.\n\nTurn 45: Alice at (4,1), orientation R.\n\nAlice action: Move R to (5,1). Now at (5,1), orientation R.\n\nTurn 46: Alice at (5,1), orientation R. She needs to face up to interact with (5,2). So action: Change Orientation U. Now facing up.\n\nTurn 47: Alice at (5,1), facing up. Action: Interact to pick up onion from (5,2). Now holding onion.\n\nTurn 48: Alice at (5,1), holding onion, facing up. She needs to go to (4,1) to add to pot. Action: Move L to (4,1). Now at (4,1), orientation L (facing left).\n\nTurn 49: Alice at (4,1), facing L. Need to face down to interact with pot. Action: Change Orientation D. Now facing down.\n\nTurn 50: Alice at (4,1), facing down. Action: Interact to add onion to pot at (4,0). Pot now has one onion. Alice holding nothing.\n\nNow, Alice can go to get another onion. For example, from (4,1), she can move R to (5,1). Turn 51: Move R to (5,1), orientation R.\n\nThen at (5,1), she can move R to (6,1). Turn 52: Move R to (6,1), orientation R.\n\nThen at (6,1), she needs to face down to interact with (6,0) which has onion. Action: Change Orientation D. Turn 53: Change orientation to D.\n\nThen Interact to pick up onion. Turn 54: Interact to pick up onion from (6,0). Now holding onion.\n\nThen she can go back to (4,1) to add to pot. From (6,1), move L to (5,1). Turn 55: Move L to (5,1), orientation L.\n\nThen move L to (4,1). Turn 56: Move L to (4,1), orientation L.\n\nThen change orientation to D. Turn 57: Change orientation D.\n\nThen interact to add onion. Turn 58: Interact to add to pot. Pot now has two onions.\n\nWe need a third onion.\n\nBob has one, so he should add it.\n\nOr Alice can get another, but Bob has one ready.\n\nAssume Bob adds his at some point.\n\nFor example, at turn 51, when Alice moves to (5,1), (4,1) is free, so Bob can be at (5,1) or something.\n\nBut Bob might not be there.\n\nTo simplify, after turn 50, Alice can stay or move, but we need the third onion.\n\nThere is onion at (2,2) and (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is above.\n\nAlice at (4,1) after turn 50, she can go to (5,4).\n\nFirst to (5,1), then to (5,2) not possible, so to (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,1), move R to (5,1) turn 51.\n\nThen from (5,1), she can move U? But (5,2) is counter, not walkable, so she can move to (5,0) not possible, or to (6,1), but to go up, she needs to go to (5,3) or something.\n\nFrom (5,1), move U to (5,2) not possible, so she can only move left, right, down, but down not, so move R to (6,1) or L to (4,1), but (4,1) is current.\n\nPositions: from (5,1), she can move R to (6,1), or L to (4,1), or U not, D not, so only left or right.\n\nTo reach (5,4), which is at row 4, col 5.\n\n(5,4) is a kitchen counter, so she needs to be on adjacent empty tile, like (5,3), (4,4), (6,4), (5,5) invalid.\n\n(5,3) should be empty, (4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable, (6,4) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo only from (5,3) facing north.\n\nFirst, Alice needs to go to (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,1), she can move to (6,1), then to (6,2) not, so to (6,0) not, or to (5,2) not.\n\nFrom (5,1), she can move to (4,1), but that's back.\n\nShe can go to (6,1), then to (6,2)? (6,2) should be empty, then from (6,2) move U to (6,3) if available.\n\n(6,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen from (6,3) move U to (6,4)? (6,4) is kitchen counter, not walkable. Or move L to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) empty.\n\nFrom (6,3) move L to (5,3).\n\nThen at (5,3), she can face U to interact with (5,4) to pick up onion.\n\nBut (5,4) has onion, yes.\n\nBut this is long.\n\nFrom (4,1), after turn 50, she can move R to (5,1) turn 51.\n\nThen from (5,1), move to (5,0) not possible, so only to (6,1) or stay.\n\nMove R to (6,1) turn 52.\n\nThen at (6,1), move U? Not, so move to (6,2) if possible? From (6,1), move U to (6,2), (6,2) should be empty, so Move U to (6,2), orientation U.\n\nTurn 53: Move U to (6,2), facing up.\n\nThen from (6,2), she can move U to (6,3)? (6,3) empty, Move U. Turn 54: Move U to (6,3), facing up.\n\nThen from (6,3), move L to (5,3). Turn 55: Move L to (5,3), facing left.\n\nThen at (5,3), change orientation to U to face (5,4). Turn 56: Change orientation U.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion. Turn 57: Interact with (5,4) to get onion.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to go back to pot at (4,0).\n\nFrom (5,3), move D to (5,2) not possible, so move R to (6,3) or L to (4,3), etc.\n\nTo (4,3): from (5,3) move L to (4,3). Turn 58: Move L to (4,3), facing left.\n\nThen from (4,3), move D to (4,2) not possible, so move to (4,1) or (3,3), etc.\n\nMove D to (4,2) not, so move to (4,1) directly? From (4,3) to (4,2) not, so move to (3,3) or (5,3), or down not.\n\nMove to (4,1) by going to (4,0) not.\n\nShe needs to go to (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (4,3), move D not possible, so she can move to (3,3) or (5,3), then to lower rows.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), move L to (3,3). Turn 59: Move L to (3,3), facing left.\n\nThen from (3,3), move D not possible, so move to (2,3) or (4,3), or down not.\n\nMove to (3,2) not, so move L to (2,3). Turn 60: Move L to (2,3), facing left.\n\nThen from (2,3), move D to (2,2) not possible, so move to (1,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nThis is taking too many turns.\n\nIt's inefficient for Alice to get the onion from (5,4); better to get from (6,0) or (2,2).\n\n(6,0) is closer.\n\nAfter turn 50, Alice at (4,1), she can move R to (5,1) turn 51.\n\nThen move R to (6,1) turn 52.\n\nThen at (6,1), change orientation D to face (6,0). Turn 53: Change orientation D.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion from (6,0). Turn 54: Interact, get onion.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen move L to (5,1) turn 55: Move L to (5,1), orientation L.\n\nThen move L to (4,1) turn 56: Move L to (4,1), orientation L.\n\nThen change orientation to D turn 57: Change orientation D.\n\nThen interact to add to pot turn 58: Interact, add onion.\n\nPot now has two onions.\n\nWe need a third.\n\nBob has one onion, he should add it.\n\nOr Alice can get another, but Bob is there.\n\nAssume that at turn 51, Bob moves to (4,1) and adds his onion.\n\nAt turn 50, Alice is at (4,1), after interact, turn 51 she moves to (5,1), so (4,1) free.\n\nIf Bob is at (5,1) at turn 50, he can move to (4,1) at turn 51.\n\nThen at (4,1), he can change orientation to D and interact to add onion.\n\nBut Bob needs to be at (5,1) at turn 50.\n\nFrom earlier, Bob at turn 45: at (3,3)\n\nTurn 45: Move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 46: Move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 47: Move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 48: Move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 49: Move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 50: Move L to (5,1)\n\nAt turn 50, Bob at (5,1)\n\nThen at turn 51, Alice moves to (5,1) from (4,1), but (5,1) might be occupied.\n\nConflict.\n\nAt turn 50, Alice at (4,1), Bob at (5,1)\n\nTurn 51: Alice moves R to (5,1), but (5,1) has Bob, so she cannot move there; players cannot walk through each other.\n\nSo Alice cannot move to (5,1) if Bob is there.\n\nSimilarly, Bob cannot move to (4,1) if Alice is there at turn 51.\n\nAt turn 50, Alice is at (4,1), Bob at (5,1)\n\nTurn 51: Alice can move to another direction, say U to (4,2) not possible, or D not, or L to (3,1), or R to (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo move L to (3,1) if empty.\n\n(3,1) should be empty.\n\nSo Alice action turn 51: Move L to (3,1), orientation L.\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face D to interact with pot at (3,0), but pot at (3,0) is empty, and she is holding nothing, so no.\n\nShe can go to get another onion.\n\nBut she is not holding anything now.\n\nAfter turn 50, she is holding nothing.\n\nSo at (3,1), she can stay or move.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob at (5,1) at turn 50, he can move L to (4,1) at turn 51, since Alice moved away.\n\nTurn 51: Alice moves L to (3,1), so (4,1) free.\n\nBob move L to (4,1), now at (4,1), facing L (since move L).\n\nThen he can change orientation to D turn 52 for Bob, then interact to add his onion to pot at (4,0) turn 53.\n\nPot at (4,0) has one onion from Alice, plus Bob's, so now two onions.\n\nThen Alice can get the third onion.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), she can go to (2,2) to get onion.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), kitchen counter with onion.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move L to (2,1)? (2,1) not listed, empty.\n\nThen from (2,1), she can face U to interact with (2,2) north.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), so from (2,1) facing up.\n\nSo Alice at turn 51: at (3,1), facing L (after move).\n\nTurn 52: Move L to (2,1), orientation L.\n\nThen turn 53: Change orientation U to face up.\n\nTurn 54: Interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can go to (3,1) or (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (2,1), move R to (3,1) turn 55: Move R to (3,1), orientation R.\n\nThen at (3,1), change orientation D to face pot at (3,0) turn 56: Change orientation D.\n\nThen interact to add onion to pot at (3,0) turn 57.\n\nBut pot at (3,0) is empty, so adding one onion, not to (4,0).\n\nWe want to add to (4,0) which has two onions.\n\nSo from (2,1), she should go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), move R to (3,1) turn 55.\n\nThen move R to (4,1) turn 56, but (4,1) might have Bob.\n\nAt turn 53, Bob added onion to (4,0), so at turn 54, Bob might move away.\n\nAssume Bob moves away after adding.\n\nAt turn 53, Bob added, so at turn 54, Bob can move to (5,1) or something.\n\nThen (4,1) free.\n\nAlice at (2,1) after turn 54, holding onion.\n\nTurn 55: Move R to (3,1), orientation R.\n\nTurn 56: Move R to (4,1), orientation R.\n\nThen turn 57: Change orientation D to face down.\n\nTurn 58: Interact to add onion to pot at (4,0).\n\nNow pot has three onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so after 5 turns, it is cooked.\n\nThen we need to serve it with a plate.\n\nBut for now, with Alice's actions, we have filled the pot at turn 58.\n\nBut let's list Alice's actions from turn 45.\n\nTurn 45: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 46: Change orientation U\n\nTurn 47: Interact (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nTurn 48: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 49: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 50: Interact (add onion to (4,0))\n\nTurn 51: Move L to (3,1)  (since (4,1) will be used by Bob)\n\nTurn 52: Move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 53: Change orientation U\n\nTurn 54: Interact (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 55: Move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 56: Move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 57: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 58: Interact (add onion to (4,0))\n\nAt turn 58, she adds the third onion, but Bob added one at turn 53, so at turn 58, pot might have 4 onions? No.\n\nAt turn 50, Alice added first onion.\n\nThen at turn 53, Bob added second.\n\nThen at turn 58, Alice adds third, so yes, three onions.\n\nCooking starts at turn 58 when the third onion is added.\n\nAfter 5 turns, at turn 63, it is cooked.\n\nThen we need to serve.\n\nBut for Alice's plan, we can stop here or continue to serving.\n\nThe task is to maximize reward, so we should plan to serve.\n\nBut serving requires a plate with soup.\n\nFirst, someone needs to get a plate, then serve the soup at serving counter.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSo Alice or Bob can get a plate.\n\nAlice after adding onion at turn 58, she can go to get a plate.\n\nBut (0,2) is far.\n\nBob might be closer or something.\n\nSince we are planning Alice, let's see.\n\nAfter turn 58, Alice at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to (0,2) to get plate.\n\nBut it's far, many turns.\n\nAlternatively, after the pot is cooking, she can get a plate.\n\nBut cooking takes 5 turns, so during that time, she can get the plate.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can do it.\n\nBut for Alice's actions, after turn 58, she can start moving to plate dispenser.\n\nFrom (4,1), to (0,2).\n\nPath: for example, move to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), then interact with (0,2).\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nKitchen counters include (0,1), so not empty.\n\nSo to interact with (0,2), she needs to be on adjacent empty tile, like (0,1) not, (0,3), (1,2), (-1,2) invalid.\n\n(0,3) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\n(1,2) not listed, should be empty.\n\nSo from (1,2), face east to interact with (0,2).\n\nSimilarly, she can go to (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move L to (3,1) turn 59.\n\nMove L to (2,1) turn 60.\n\nMove L to (1,1) turn 61. (1,1) empty.\n\nThen from (1,1), move U to (1,2) turn 62. (1,2) empty.\n\nThen at (1,2), change orientation R to face east (since (0,2) is west? (1,2) to (0,2) is left, so face west.\n\nOrientation: to face (0,2), which is west from (1,2).\n\nSo change orientation to L.\n\nThen interact to get plate.\n\nBut at turn 62, the soup is cooking since turn 58, so at turn 63 it is cooked, so she can serve after that.\n\nBut she needs to get the plate first.\n\nThen with plate, go to pot to serve soup.\n\nBut when she interacts with pot with plate, she gets the soup on plate.\n\nThen go to serving counter.\n\nBut this is many turns.\n\nPerhaps Bob can do it, but for Alice, we can plan.\n\nSince the pot is cooking, she can get the plate during cooking time.\n\nTurn 58: cooking starts.\n\nTurn 59 to 62: move to (1,2)\n\nTurn 63: at (1,2), change orientation L to face west.\n\nTurn 64: interact to get plate from (0,2). Now holding plate.\n\nThen go to pot at (4,0) to get soup.\n\nFrom (1,2), move R to (2,2) not possible, so move to (1,1), then to (2,1), etc.\n\nTo (4,1).\n\nFrom (1,2), move D to (1,1) turn 65.\n\nThen move R to (2,1) turn 66.\n\nMove R to (3,1) turn 67.\n\nMove R to (4,1) turn 68.\n\nThen at (4,1), change orientation D turn 69.\n\nThen interact with pot to serve soup (since soup is cooked, and she has plate, so she gets the soup on plate) turn 70.\n\nThen go to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move R to (5,1) turn 71.\n\nMove R to (6,1) turn 72.\n\nThen from (6,1), move U to (6,2) turn 73.\n\n(6,2) empty.\n\nThen from (6,2), move U to (6,3) turn 74.\n\nThen move R to (7,3)? (7,3) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nServing counter at (7,2), so she can interact from (7,1) or (7,3) or (6,2).\n\n(7,1) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\n(7,3) kitchen counter.\n\n(6,2) is adjacent east? (6,2) to (7,2) is east, so from (6,2) facing east.\n\nThen interact.\n\nSo at (6,2), after turn 73, she is at (6,2), facing U? After move U to (6,2) at turn 73, orientation U.\n\nSo turn 74: change orientation R to face east.\n\nTurn 75: interact with (7,2) to deliver soup.\n\nReward obtained.\n\nBut this is very long, and we have only one soup.\n\nSince there are two pots, we can make another soup, but with the same ingredients.\n\nBut for now, with Alice's actions up to turn 58, we have the pot cooking.\n\nPerhaps for H=15 turns from turn 45, so up to turn 60.\n\nAt turn 45 to 58 is 14 turns, so we can output that.\n\nTurn 45 to 58: 14 actions.\n\nBut let's list Alice's actions from turn 45 to say turn 60.\n\nAfter turn 58, she can do something.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 58 she adds onion, so pot starts cooking.\n\nThen she can stay or move.\n\nTo save, we can stop at turn 58.\n\nBut let's see the action history.\n\nAlice action history: L, L, D, I, R (most recent at end)\n\nTurn 45 is current, so previous actions: turn 44: R, turn 43: I, turn 42: D, turn 41: L, turn 40: L.\n\nNot sure if relevant.\n\nBob history: I, R, U, I, D\n\nTurn 44: D, turn 43: I, etc.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 45:\n\nTurn 45: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 46: Change orientation U\n\nTurn 47: Interact (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nTurn 48: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 49: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 50: Interact (add onion to (4,0))\n\nTurn 51: Move L to (3,1)  // to free (4,1) for Bob\n\nTurn 52: Move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 53: Change orientation U\n\nTurn 54: Interact (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 55: Move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 56: Move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 57: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 58: Interact (add onion to (4,0))  // third onion, cooking starts\n\nFor turn 59 and 60, she can start moving to get plate or something, but optional.\n\nSince H is not specified, we can do for 15 turns.\n\nBut let's assume H=15 for the sequence.\n\nTurn 59: Move R to (5,1)  // start moving towards plate dispenser\n\nTurn 60: Move R to (6,1)\n\n etc.\n\nBut in the answer, we can output from turn 45 to turn 58 or 60.\n\nSince the pot is cooking at turn 58, reward will come later.\n\nBut for the plan, it's fine.\n\nWe can have a shorter plan.\n\nAnother idea: since there are onions on counters, and Bob has one, Alice can let Bob add his onion first, but she needs to move.\n\nAt turn 45, Alice can move to (3,1) to allow Bob to access (4,1).\n\nBut Bob is far.\n\nAlice at (4,1), turn 45: Move L to (3,1)\n\nThen at (3,1), she can do nothing or move.\n\nThen Bob can come to (4,1) and add his onion.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,3), it takes time.\n\nFor example, turn 45 Alice Move L to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 46 Alice Change orientation D to face pot (3,0), but empty, no interact.\n\nSo she can stay or move to get onion.\n\nBut not efficient.\n\nI think the first plan is better.\n\nSo I'll go with Alice's actions from turn 45 to turn 58 as above.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 54, she picks up onion from (2,2), which has onion, yes.\n\nThen adds to (4,0) at turn 58.\n\nWith Bob adding one in between.\n\nSo for the output, only Alice's actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 45: R  (Move R)\n\nTurn 46: U  (Change orientation U)\n\nTurn 47: I  (Interact)\n\nTurn 48: L  (Move L)\n\nTurn 49: D  (Change orientation D)\n\nTurn 50: I  (Interact)\n\nTurn 51: L  (Move L)\n\nTurn 52: L  (Move L)\n\nTurn 53: U  (Change orientation U)\n\nTurn 54: I  (Interact)\n\nTurn 55: R  (Move R)\n\nTurn 56: R  (Move R)\n\nTurn 57: D  (Change orientation D)\n\nTurn 58: I  (Interact)\n\nFor turn 59 and 60, we can add Move R and Move R, but not necessary.\n\nSince H not specified, this should be fine.\n\nTo maximize reward, during the cooking time, she can prepare for the next soup or get plate.\n\nBut for now, this sequence helps fill the pot.\n\nSo I think this is acceptable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should collaborate to fill one pot with three onions as quickly as possible to start cooking the onion soup (which requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and yields a reward of 20). Given the current game state at turn 45, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing, and Bob is at (3,3) holding one onion. The pots are empty, and there are onions available on kitchen counters at (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), and (2,2). The plan prioritizes using the onion from (5,2) for Alice to add to the pot at (4,0), then having Alice fetch another onion from (2,2) while Bob adds his onion to the same pot. This sequence ensures the pot starts cooking by turn 58.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Pot Selection**: Use pot at (4,0) for efficiency, as Alice is closer to it initially.\n- **Bob's Role**: Bob should add his onion to the pot at (4,0) around turn 53 (inferred from his position and holding state; Alice moves away from (4,1) at turn 51 to allow Bob access).\n- **Cooking and Serving**: After adding the third onion at turn 58, the soup cooks for 5 turns (ready at turn 63). Alice or Bob can then fetch a plate from (0,2) and serve at (7,2) for reward, but this is beyond the planned sequence.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 45 to 58):\nThe sequence below optimizes Alice's actions to fetch and add two onions to the pot at (4,0), while coordinating with Bob to add the third. Alice's actions are planned for 14 turns (H=14), ensuring the pot is filled and cooking starts.\n\n- **Turn 45**: Move R to (5,1) – Alice moves right to position for accessing the onion on (5,2).\n- **Turn 46**: Change orientation U – Faces up to interact with kitchen counter (5,2).\n- **Turn 47**: Interact – Picks up onion from (5,2); now holding onion.\n- **Turn 48**: Move L to (4,1) – Moves left to position above pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 49**: Change orientation D – Faces down to interact with pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 50**: Interact – Adds onion to pot (4,0); pot now has one onion; Alice holds nothing.\n- **Turn 51**: Move L to (3,1) – Moves left to free (4,1) for Bob and position for accessing (2,2).\n- **Turn 52**: Move L to (2,1) – Moves left to adjacent tile for kitchen counter (2,2).\n- **Turn 53**: Change orientation U – Faces up to interact with (2,2).\n- **Turn 54**: Interact – Picks up onion from (2,2); now holding onion.\n- **Turn 55**: Move R to (3,1) – Moves right toward pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 56**: Move R to (4,1) – Moves right to position above pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 57**: Change orientation D – Faces down to interact with pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 58**: Interact – Adds onion to pot (4,0); pot now has three onions (Alice's second onion, plus Bob's added around turn 53); cooking starts.\n\n### Outcome:\n- By turn 58, the pot at (4,0) has three onions and begins cooking (completes at turn 63 for 20 reward).\n- Total actions: 14 turns (H=14) to start cooking; further actions would involve fetching a plate and serving, but this sequence focuses on efficient filling.\n- **Coordination with Bob**: Bob should add his onion to (4,0) around turn 53 (e.g., by moving to (4,1) when free and interacting). Alice's actions at turns 51-52 facilitate this by vacating (4,1).\n\nThis plan maximizes reward by minimizing idle time and leveraging available resources (onions on counters). After cooking starts, Alice or Bob can fetch a plate from (0,2) during the cooking delay.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: R \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: I \\\\\nTurn 48: L \\\\\nTurn 49: D \\\\\nTurn 50: I \\\\\nTurn 51: L \\\\\nTurn 52: L \\\\\nTurn 53: U \\\\\nTurn 54: I \\\\\nTurn 55: R \\\\\nTurn 56: R \\\\\nTurn 57: D \\\\\nTurn 58: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 49. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the environment and current state:\n\n- **Tile Types**:\n  - Kitchen Counters: Many positions, some of which have onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2) each have an onion.\n  - Onion Dispensers: (3,4) and (4,4)\n  - Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n  - Pots: (3,0) and (4,0)\n  - Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\n- **Recipe**: Only one recipe provided: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20, cooks in 5 turns.\n\n- **Players**:\n  - Alice (me): at (4,1), facing right (R), holding nothing.\n  - Bob: at (3,3), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n\nWe note that there are onions already on several kitchen counters. Also, the pots are empty.\n\nThe recipe requires 3 onions. We can use the existing onions on the counters to avoid having to get them from the dispensers.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe need to make a soup that requires 3 onions. We have two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). We can use one of them.\n\nSteps for one soup:\n\n1. Get three onions into a pot.\n2. Wait for the pot to cook (5 turns).\n3. Get a plate.\n4. Serve the soup from the pot to the serving counter.\n\nBut note: we have two players. So we can coordinate.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- Alice is at (4,1). She is above the pots (which are at (3,0) and (4,0)). She is one step above (4,0). She is facing right, which is towards (5,1) and then (5,0) is below (5,1) but not adjacent to her? Actually, she is at (4,1) and facing right. To interact with the pot at (4,0), she would need to be adjacent and facing it. So she must move down to (4,0) and face down? But note: (4,0) is a pot, so she can't stand on it. She must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nThe grid:\n\nLet me sketch a small grid:\n\nRow y=4: Kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4); Onion dispensers at (3,4), (4,4)\nRow y=3: Kitchen counters at (0,3), (7,3)\nRow y=2: Kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2); Plate dispenser at (0,2); Serving counter at (7,2)\nRow y=1: Kitchen counters at (0,1), (7,1); Alice at (4,1) facing right.\nRow y=0: Kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0); Pots at (3,0), (4,0)\n\nAlice is at (4,1). To interact with the pot at (4,0), she must be at (4,1) and face down (because (4,0) is below (4,1)). But she is currently facing right. So she needs to change orientation to down and then interact? However, note that the pot is adjacent and below her. So if she faces down, she can interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3). He is above the kitchen counter at (3,2) which has an onion? Actually, (3,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. He is at (3,3) and facing down. So he is adjacent and facing (3,2). He can interact to pick up that onion.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter at (3,2) has an onion. So Bob could pick it up.\n\nHowever, we need to get onions into a pot. We have multiple onions on counters. We can use them.\n\nLet's assign tasks:\n\nOption 1: Use the existing onions on the counters to fill a pot.\n\nWe note the onions are at:\n- (5,2): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (6,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n\nThe pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nWe are at turn 49. We need to plan for the next several turns (H turns). Let's set H=20 to cover the cooking time (5 turns) and the delivery.\n\nBut note: we don't have to do everything in 20 turns, but we want to maximize the reward. Since we can only make one recipe at a time and the reward is 20, let's aim to make one soup and deliver it.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Bob is at (3,3) facing down. He can interact to pick up the onion at (3,2). Then he can go to a pot and put it in.\n\n   - Turn 49: Bob interacts (I) to pick up the onion from (3,2). Then he is holding an onion.\n\n   But note: Bob is at (3,3) and facing down. The counter at (3,2) is adjacent and he is facing it. So he can pick it up.\n\n2. Alice: at (4,1) facing right. We want her to help with the pot. She can go to another counter to pick up an onion? Or she can go to a pot to start putting onions? But she is near the pot at (4,0). However, she doesn't have an onion. So she must first get an onion.\n\n   Where can she get an onion? The nearest might be the kitchen counter at (5,2) or (3,2) but (3,2) is about to be taken by Bob? Or we can use another one.\n\n   Alternatively, she can go to the onion dispenser? But the dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). She is at (4,1). That's a bit far.\n\n   But note: there is an onion at (5,2) which is at the same row as (4,1) but one step right and one down? Actually, (5,2) is to the right and down one. From (4,1) to (5,2): she can go right to (5,1) and then down to (5,2). But (5,1) is a kitchen counter? Actually, the kitchen counters at row y=1 are (0,1) and (7,1). So (5,1) is empty? Let me check the list: the kitchen counters are at (0,0) to (7,0) and so on. Specifically, (5,1) is not in the kitchen counter list, so it is empty and walkable.\n\n   So Alice can:\n     - Move right to (5,1) [action: R]\n     - Then move down to (5,2) [action: D] -> now she is at (5,2) which is a kitchen counter? But note: kitchen counters are for storage, they are not walkable? Actually, the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the kitchen counter is a tile type that is non-empty only if it has an item? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: ...\" and then in the state we have \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" meaning they have items. But the tile itself is walkable when empty? Actually, the rules say: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the other tiles (dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are non-empty? But note: the rules say \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined by having an item? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The kitchen counter is a tile type that is always there. And the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that are not empty? But the empty tile is a type. The others are not walkable? \n\n   Let me reread:\n\n   - **Empty Tile:** Walkable space.\n   - **Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter:** These are non-empty? But note: the rule says \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning tiles that are not of type Empty? Or tiles that are occupied by an item? Actually, the rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" So the player must stand on an empty tile (which is walkable) and adjacent to the non-empty tile (which could be a dispenser, pot, etc.). Therefore, the non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, counters) are not walkable. So Alice cannot walk onto (5,2) because it is a kitchen counter? But then how does she pick up the item? She must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face the counter.\n\n   So for (5,2): it is a kitchen counter and currently has an onion. Alice must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face (5,2) to interact.\n\n   Adjacent empty tiles to (5,2): \n     - (5,1): above -> is (5,1) empty? Yes, because it's not listed as any non-empty tile. So it's an empty tile? Actually, the tile types: the grid has empty tiles and then the special tiles. The kitchen counters are at specific positions. So (5,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it's an empty tile? Similarly, (5,3) is not listed? But we don't have a full grid. We only know the positions of the non-empty tiles? Actually, the problem gives the list of kitchen counters, which are fixed. So (5,1) is not in that list, so it's an empty tile.\n\n   Therefore, Alice can stand at (5,1) and face down to interact with (5,2). Or at (4,2) (if it's empty) or (6,2) or (5,3). But (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (4,2) is in the kitchen counter list. So not walkable. Similarly, (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=2: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (6,2) is not listed, so it's empty? Actually, we don't know. The list of kitchen counters is fixed, so any tile not in that list is either empty or another type? But the problem only lists kitchen counters and then other types (dispensers, etc.). We know the dispensers, pots, and serving counter. So (6,2) is not a kitchen counter and not a dispenser, pot, or serving counter? Then it must be empty.\n\n   But for simplicity, Alice can go to (5,1) and then face down to interact with (5,2).\n\n   Steps for Alice at turn 49:\n\n   - Move right to (5,1) [action: R] -> now at (5,1), facing right? But she was facing right and moved right, so now facing right? Then she needs to face down to interact with (5,2). So next turn, change orientation to down? Then interact.\n\n   Alternatively, we can have her move and then change orientation in one step? But each turn one action.\n\n   But note: we are planning for both players simultaneously. We can plan for Alice and Bob.\n\n   Let me try to plan for the next few turns:\n\n   Turn 49:\n     - Alice: Move right (R) to (5,1). Now at (5,1), orientation right.\n     - Bob: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (3,2). Now Bob is holding an onion.\n\n   Turn 50:\n     - Alice: Change orientation to down (D) so she can interact with (5,2). Now facing down.\n     - Bob: He is at (3,3) holding an onion. He needs to put it into a pot. The nearest pot is at (3,0) or (4,0). He is at (3,3). He can go down to (3,2) but (3,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable? So he cannot go to (3,2). He must go around? The adjacent tiles: \n           (3,4): above -> but he is at (3,3) and facing down? He can move down? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty, so he cannot walk there. So he must go left, right, or up? \n           Left: (2,3) -> is that empty? We don't have a full grid, but we know kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3). So (2,3) and (3,3) are not listed? Actually, (3,3) is Bob's current position, which is empty? But we don't know about (2,3). Similarly, (4,3) is not listed? So they are empty? \n\n        Actually, the grid might be:\n\n        We know:\n          y=4: ... and (3,4) and (4,4) are onion dispensers -> non-empty, so not walkable.\n          y=3: (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters -> non-empty. So (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) are empty? But Bob is at (3,3) so it's empty? And (2,3) and (4,3) are empty? \n\n        So Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) or down? Down to (3,2) is not possible because (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty). So he must go left or right.\n\n        To get to a pot, he needs to go down. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). So he can go to (3,1) or (4,1) and then down? But (3,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters at y=1: (0,1) and (7,1). So (3,1) is empty? Similarly, (4,1) is where Alice was, now empty? So:\n\n        Bob can move right to (4,3) [action: R] -> now at (4,3). Then next turn move down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, and non-empty? So cannot walk. So he must avoid (4,2). So from (4,3), he can move down? No because (4,2) is blocked. So he must go around? \n\n        Alternatively, he can move left to (2,3) [action: L], then down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter? And it has an onion? So non-empty, cannot walk. So then he must go to (2,4) or (1,3)? This is getting complicated.\n\n        Another idea: Bob can go to (3,4)? But (3,4) is an onion dispenser and non-empty, so he can't walk there. So he is stuck? \n\n        Actually, Bob is at (3,3) and the only adjacent empty tiles are (2,3), (4,3), and (3,4) is non-empty? But (3,4) is above: but we don't have the full grid. The problem doesn't specify the entire grid, only the non-empty tiles. So we assume that any tile not listed as a non-empty tile (kitchen counter, dispenser, pot, serving counter) is empty and walkable? But note: the pots and dispensers are non-empty and non-walkable. Kitchen counters and serving counters are also non-walkable.\n\n        So adjacent to (3,3):\n          North: (3,4) -> onion dispenser -> non-walkable.\n          South: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n          East: (4,3) -> not listed as non-empty -> walkable.\n          West: (2,3) -> not listed as non-empty -> walkable.\n\n        So Bob can go east to (4,3) or west to (2,3). \n\n        Now, to get to the pots, he must go down to row y=0. But the path is blocked at y=2 by kitchen counters? How to get to (3,0) or (4,0)?\n\n        Let's look at the grid at y=1 and y=0:\n\n        y=1: kitchen counters at (0,1) and (7,1). So (1,1) to (6,1) are empty? \n        y=0: kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0); and pots at (3,0) and (4,0). So the pots are non-empty? So they are non-walkable. And the kitchen counters at y=0 are non-walkable.\n\n        So the walkable path to the pots must be through the empty tiles at y=1 and then the player must stand at the adjacent empty tile to the pot and face it.\n\n        For the pot at (3,0): adjacent empty tiles? \n          North: (3,1) -> empty? Yes, because not listed as non-empty. So a player can stand at (3,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (3,0).\n        Similarly, for (4,0): (4,1) is adjacent and empty? But (4,1) is where Alice was, and she moved to (5,1). So (4,1) is empty.\n\n        So Bob can go to (3,1) to interact with the pot at (3,0). How?\n\n        From (3,3):\n          Move east to (4,3) -> then move south to (4,2) is blocked? No, (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So he must go to (4,3) then to (5,3) (if empty) then to (5,2) is blocked? (5,2) is kitchen counter. So that doesn't work.\n\n        Alternatively, from (3,3) go west to (2,3). Then down to (2,2) is blocked. Then he can go to (1,3) -> (1,2) -> ... but that seems long.\n\n        Another way: from (3,3) go to (4,3) [east], then to (4,4) is blocked (onion dispenser). So he can go to (5,3) [east from (4,3)]? (5,3) is not listed as non-empty, so empty. Then from (5,3) he can go down to (5,2) -> blocked? (5,2) is kitchen counter. So then to (5,1): empty? Yes. Then he can go to (5,0) -> but (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So he can't go to (5,0). Then how to get to (3,1) or (4,1)?\n\n        Actually, from (5,3) he can go west to (4,3) and then? We are stuck.\n\n        Alternatively, from (3,3) go to (2,3) [west], then to (1,3) [west], then to (1,2) [south] -> (1,2) is not listed as non-empty? So empty. Then to (1,1) [south] -> empty. Then to (1,0) -> blocked (kitchen counter). Then to (2,1) [east] -> empty? Then to (3,1) [east]. Then he can interact with the pot at (3,0).\n\n        That is a long path: 5 moves.\n\n        Alternatively, is there a shorter path? \n\n        We note that at y=1, the tiles from (1,1) to (6,1) are empty. So Bob can go from (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked, but he can go to (2,3) -> (2,2) blocked, so then (2,3) to (2,4)? (2,4) is a kitchen counter? It is listed at (2,4) -> yes, kitchen counter -> blocked. So he must go to (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). \n\n        Steps for Bob to get to (3,1):\n          Turn 49: Bob picks up onion at (3,2) by interacting (I). Then he is at (3,3) holding onion.\n          Turn 50: Move west to (2,3)\n          Turn 51: Move west to (1,3)\n          Turn 52: Move south to (1,2)\n          Turn 53: Move south to (1,1)\n          Turn 54: Move east to (2,1)\n          Turn 55: Move east to (3,1)\n\n        Then at (3,1), he can face down and interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0).\n\n        That is 7 turns just to put one onion. This is inefficient.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have Bob put the onion on a kitchen counter that is closer to the pot? But that might not help.\n\n        Another idea: use the kitchen counter at (3,2) is already occupied? But Bob just picked up the onion from (3,2), so now it's empty? Then Bob could move to (3,2) if it were walkable? But kitchen counters are non-walkable even when empty? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" but a kitchen counter is a tile type that is always non-empty? Or when it has no item, is it walkable? \n\n        The rules do not explicitly say. But note: the tile type is fixed. The kitchen counter is a tile that is used for storage. The rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if ...\", meaning that the tile itself is non-empty? But when the kitchen counter is empty, is it then walkable? \n\n        The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and then in the state we have \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" meaning it has an item. So when it is empty, it might be walkable? But the rule for movement: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined by having an item? Or by being a non-empty tile type? \n\n        The rule for interaction says: \"non-empty tile\", which likely means a tile that is not of type Empty. Because the tile types are: Empty, Dispenser, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter. Only Empty is walkable? The others are not.\n\n        This is ambiguous. But in the Overcooked game, typically, counters are not walkable. So I think we have to assume that kitchen counters (and dispensers, pots, serving counters) are non-walkable always.\n\n        So Bob cannot walk on (3,2) even if it is empty.\n\n        Therefore, the long path is necessary? Or we can use a different strategy.\n\n        Given the complexity, let's reassign tasks.\n\n        Since there are onions at multiple counters, perhaps Alice can handle the pot at (4,0) and Bob can handle the pot at (3,0) but we only need one pot for one soup.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have both players work on the same pot.\n\n        Since Alice is already near the pot at (4,0), let her get onions and put them in the pot at (4,0).\n\n        Alice is at (5,1) at turn 49 (after moving right). Then at turn 50, she changes orientation to down (D) to face (5,2). Then at turn 51, she can interact to pick up the onion from (5,2). Then she is holding an onion.\n\n        Then she can go to the pot at (4,0). How? \n          From (5,1) holding onion, she can move left to (4,1) [action: L] -> now at (4,1). Then face down (if not already) and interact to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). But she was at (5,1) facing down, then moved left to (4,1) -> now facing left? Or does orientation change with move? The move action changes position and orientation? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when she moves left, she is now at (4,1) and facing left. So she is not facing the pot (which is down). So she needs to change orientation to down (action: D) and then interact.\n\n        So:\n          Turn 51: Alice interacts (I) to pick up onion at (5,2) -> now holding onion.\n          Turn 52: Move left (L) to (4,1) -> now at (4,1), facing left.\n          Turn 53: Change orientation to down (D) -> facing down.\n          Turn 54: Interact (I) to put onion in pot at (4,0).\n\n        Now the pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\n        Meanwhile, Bob can be doing something else. But he is far away. He can go to a different counter to get another onion.\n\n        For example, there is an onion at (2,2). Bob is at (3,3). He can try to pick up the onion at (2,2):\n\n          He is at (3,3). He can move west to (2,3) [action: L] -> turn 49.\n          Then at (2,3), he can change orientation to south (if not already) to face (2,2). But he is holding nothing, so he can interact to pick up the onion at (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So he needs to be at (2,3) and facing down to interact.\n\n          Turn 49: Bob moves west (L) to (2,3) -> facing west? Because move left changes orientation to left? Or does it change to the direction of movement? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when he moves left, he is now facing left. So he is not facing down. So next turn, he must change orientation to down (action: D) and then interact.\n\n          Turn 50: Bob changes orientation to down (D).\n          Turn 51: Bob interacts (I) to pick up onion from (2,2) -> now holding onion.\n\n        Then he needs to put it in a pot. The nearest pot is (3,0) or (4,0). He is at (2,3). He can go to (3,3) [east] -> then to (3,2) is blocked, so then to (4,3) [east] -> then to (4,2) blocked, then to (5,3) [east] -> then to (5,2) blocked, then to (5,1) [south] -> then to (5,0) blocked. Alternatively, go to (1,3) and then down as before? That is long.\n\n        Alternatively, from (2,3) he can go south? But (2,2) is blocked, so no. He can go to (1,3) and then down to (1,1) and then east to (3,1) as before.\n\n        But note: there is a kitchen counter at (2,4) and (1,4), so he can't go north from (2,3) to (2,4) because (2,4) is kitchen counter.\n\n        So from (2,3):\n          Turn 52: move west to (1,3)\n          Turn 53: move south to (1,2) -> empty\n          Turn 54: move south to (1,1) -> empty\n          Turn 55: move east to (2,1) -> empty\n          Turn 56: move east to (3,1) -> now at (3,1)\n\n        Then at (3,1), he can face down and interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0).\n\n        But we want to use the same pot? We have two pots. We are making one soup in the pot at (4,0). We don't need to put the onion in a different pot.\n\n        How about Bob puts the onion in the same pot at (4,0)? He would need to go to (4,1) and face down. But Alice might be there? \n\n        Let's see the timeline:\n\n        By turn 54, Alice has put one onion in the pot at (4,0) and is at (4,1) facing down. Then she can move away.\n\n        Bob can then come to (4,1)? But Alice is there at turn 54. So turn 55: Alice moves away, say to (5,1) [right], then Bob can come to (4,1) at turn 55 or later.\n\n        But it's messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have Bob put the onion on a kitchen counter near the pot? For example, there is a kitchen counter at (6,0) which has an onion already, but we can use it for temporary storage? Or at (5,0) which is a kitchen counter and currently empty? The kitchen counters at (6,0) has an onion already, so it's occupied. But (5,0) is a kitchen counter and empty? We don't know. The state says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" lists (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2) as having onions. So (5,0) is not listed as non-empty, so it is empty. So Bob can put his onion on (5,0) and then Alice can pick it up and put it in the pot? But that might not be efficient.\n\n        Given the time, let's focus on Alice doing the first onion and then she can get a second onion.\n\n        We have three onions in the kitchen counter at (5,2), (6,0), (5,4), etc. But (5,2) is being used by Alice, and (2,2) by Bob.\n\n        Revised plan for Alice to put two more onions in the pot:\n\n        After Alice puts the first onion at turn 54, she is at (4,1) facing down. Then she can go to get another onion.\n\n        Where? The nearest is (5,2) but she just took it? Now it's empty. Next nearest might be (6,0) which is a kitchen counter at (6,0) and has an onion. But (6,0) is at y=0, x=6. She is at (4,1). She can go right to (5,1), then right to (6,1) [if empty], then face down to interact with (6,0)? But (6,0) is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\n        Steps for Alice after turn 54:\n          Turn 55: move right (R) to (5,1) -> facing down? She was facing down and moved right, so now facing right? \n          Turn 56: move right (R) to (6,1) -> now facing right.\n          Turn 57: change orientation to down (D) to face (6,0).\n          Turn 58: interact (I) to pick up onion from (6,0) -> holding onion.\n          Turn 59: move left (L) to (5,1) -> facing left.\n          Turn 60: move left (L) to (4,1) -> facing left.\n          Turn 61: change orientation to down (D) -> facing down.\n          Turn 62: interact (I) to put onion in pot at (4,0).\n\n        Now the pot has two onions. Then she needs a third.\n\n        Similarly, she can go to (5,4) or (3,4) for an onion. (5,4) is a kitchen counter with an onion. From (4,1) to (5,4): \n          (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) is blocked -> so she must go to (5,3) first? \n          (4,1) to (5,1) [right]\n          then to (5,2) is blocked, so to (5,0) is blocked -> no. \n          Alternatively, go up to (4,2) blocked, so she must go to (4,3)? But (4,3) is empty? \n          From (4,1) move up to (4,2) is blocked, so she can only move left, right, or down? Down is (4,0) which is a pot, blocked.\n\n        So she must go right to (5,1) -> then up to (5,2) blocked -> then she can go to (6,1) and then (6,2) -> (6,2) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters at y=2 are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) -> so (6,2) is empty. Then (6,3) -> empty? Then (6,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (6,4) is in the list. But she wants to get to (5,4) which is a kitchen counter with an onion. From (6,3) she can move west to (5,3) -> empty. Then at (5,3) she can face north to interact with (5,4)? (5,4) is north of (5,3).\n\n        This is very long.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since we have a limited horizon, perhaps we should use the onion dispensers.\n\n        There are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). Alice can go to (4,4) to get an onion. From (4,1) to (4,4): \n          (4,1) -> move up? (4,2) blocked. So she must go around. \n          (4,1) -> right to (5,1) -> up to (5,2) blocked -> so to (5,3) -> then west to (4,3) -> then north to (4,4) -> but (4,4) is an onion dispenser, non-walkable. So she must stand adjacent and face it.\n\n        The adjacent empty tiles to (4,4): \n          South: (4,3) -> empty? Yes.\n          East: (5,4) -> kitchen counter, non-walkable.\n          West: (3,4) -> dispenser, non-walkable.\n          North: probably out of bound or blocked.\n\n        So she can stand at (4,3) and face north to interact with (4,4) to get an onion.\n\n        Steps from (4,1) after turn 54:\n          Turn 55: move right to (5,1)\n          Turn 56: move up to (5,2) blocked? Cannot. So move to (5,0) is blocked. \n          Instead, from (5,1) move up? (5,1) to (5,2) is blocked. So move east to (6,1) [action: R] -> turn 55: (5,1) to (6,1)\n          Turn 56: move up to (6,2) [U] -> (6,2) is empty.\n          Turn 57: move up to (6,3) [U] -> empty.\n          Turn 58: move west to (5,3) [L] -> empty.\n          Turn 59: move west to (4,3) [L] -> empty.\n          Turn 60: change orientation to north (U) to face (4,4).\n          Turn 61: interact (I) to get onion.\n\n        Then she needs to go back to the pot at (4,0). That will take many turns.\n\n        Given the time, and since we are at turn 49, and we want to plan for H=20 turns (up to turn 69), we might not have time to complete the soup.\n\n        Alternative strategy: use the existing onions and have both players work on the same pot.\n\n        But with the pathing issues, it might be better to have Bob deposit his onion on a kitchen counter near the pot, and then Alice can use it.\n\n        For example, after Bob picks up the onion at (2,2) (by turn 51), he can go to (3,1) by the long path (arriving at turn 56) and then put the onion on the kitchen counter at (2,0) or (5,0) if they are empty? But (2,0) is a kitchen counter and currently empty? The state lists non-empty kitchen counters, so (2,0) is empty. So he can put it on (2,0) by standing at (2,1) and facing down to (2,0) and interact to place it.\n\n        Then Alice can pick it up from (2,0) and put it in the pot. But that is also not efficient.\n\n        Given the constraints, let's aim for one soup and use the easiest onions.\n\n        We have an onion at (6,0) which is close to the pot at (4,0) relatively.\n\n        Plan for Alice to get three onions from the counters that are reachable.\n\n        Onions at: (5,2) -> can be picked by Alice in 2 turns ( turn 49: move to (5,1), turn 50: face down, turn 51: interact).\n        Onion at (6,0): can be picked by Alice after she is at (6,1) and facing down.\n        Onion at (5,4): harder.\n\n        But note: there is an onion at (5,4) and (3,2) and (2,2) and (3,2) is now taken by Bob? But Bob's action: we can control Bob? The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both.\n\n        Let's plan for both to work on the pot at (4,0).\n\n        Alice will get the onion from (5,2) and (6,0) and one more.\n\n        Bob will get the onion from (2,2) and then go to the onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4) to get a new onion and put it in the pot.\n\n        But getting to the dispenser might be easier than delivering the onion from (2,2).\n\n        Detailed plan:\n\n        Turn 49:\n          Alice: R (move to (5,1))\n          Bob: I (pick up onion from (3,2)) -> now holding onion.\n\n        Turn 50:\n          Alice: D (face down to interact with (5,2))\n          Bob: L (move west to (2,3)) -> because he is at (3,3), move west to (2,3)\n\n        Turn 51:\n          Alice: I (pick up onion from (5,2)) -> holding onion.\n          Bob: D (face down to interact with (2,2)? but (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, but he is at (2,3) and facing west? He just moved west, so facing west. He needs to face south for (2,2). So he should change orientation to south (D) first.\n\n          Correction for Bob: at turn 50, he moved west to (2,3) -> now facing west. So turn 51: change orientation to south (D) to face (2,2).\n\n        Turn 52:\n          Alice: L (move west to (4,1)) -> holding onion, now at (4,1), facing west.\n          Bob: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> but wait, (2,2) already has an onion, and he is empty-handed? He is holding an onion from (3,2). He cannot pick up another because he can only carry one. So he cannot pick up the onion at (2,2) until he puts down the one he has.\n\n        This is a problem. Bob is already holding an onion. So he cannot pick up another.\n\n        So after turn 49, Bob is holding an onion. He must deliver it before picking up another.\n\n        Therefore, after turn 49, Bob should deliver the onion to a pot or a counter.\n\n        Given the difficulty, let's have Bob deliver the onion to the kitchen counter at (3,2) (which is now empty because he picked the onion) by placing it back? But then we don't make progress.\n\n        Or he can deliver it to a closer kitchen counter. For example, at (4,2) which is a kitchen counter and currently empty? The state lists non-empty kitchen counters, so (4,2) is empty. He can place the onion on (4,2) by being at (4,3) and facing south to (4,2) and interact. But he is at (3,3) holding onion.\n\n        Steps for Bob to place the onion on (4,2):\n\n          Turn 50: move east to (4,3) [action: R] -> now at (4,3), facing east.\n          Turn 51: change orientation to south (D) to face (4,2).\n          Turn 52: interact (I) to place the onion on (4,2) -> now empty-handed.\n\n        Then he can pick up the onion at (2,2) or (5,2) etc.\n\n        But then the onion is at (4,2), which is close to the pot. Alice can use it.\n\n        So after Bob places the onion at (4,2) at turn 52, then at turn 53 he can move west to (3,3) and then south is blocked, so then to (2,3) and then to (1,3) etc to get another onion, but it's still far.\n\n        Alternatively, Alice can pick up the onion from (4,2) after she is done with her current task.\n\n        Alice's current task: \n          Turn 49: move to (5,1)\n          Turn 50: face down\n          Turn 51: pick up onion from (5,2) -> holding onion.\n          Turn 52: move west to (4,1) -> holding onion, at (4,1), facing west.\n          Turn 53: face down (D) to face the pot at (4,0)\n          Turn 54: interact to put onion in pot at (4,0) -> now the pot has one onion, and Alice is empty-handed.\n\n        Then at turn 55, Alice can move to (4,2) to pick up the onion that Bob placed? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so she must be adjacent. She is at (4,1). (4,2) is above. So she can move up? But (4,2) is non-walkable, so she cannot. She can interact from (4,1) if she faces up? \n          - She is at (4,1) and (4,2) is north. So she needs to face north to interact. Currently at turn 54 after interact, she is at (4,1) facing down? The interact action doesn't change orientation. So after turn 54, she is at (4,1) facing down. \n          - Turn 55: change orientation to up (U) to face north.\n          - Turn 56: interact to pick up the onion from (4,2) -> now holding onion.\n          - Turn 57: face down (D) to face the pot.\n          - Turn 58: interact to put onion in pot -> now the pot has two onions.\n\n        Then she needs a third onion.\n\n        The nearest is (6,0) or (5,4) or (3,4) or (5,0) empty? Or the dispenser.\n\n        Since the dispenser is at (4,4), and she is at (4,1), she can go up to (4,2) is blocked, so east to (5,1) -> then north to (5,2) is blocked, then east to (6,1) -> north to (6,2) -> west to (5,2) is blocked, then north to (6,3) -> west to (5,3) -> north to (5,4) is blocked. \n\n        To get to (4,4) dispenser, she can:\n          From (4,1) after turn 58: \n          Turn 59: move east to (5,1)\n          Turn 60: move east to (6,1)\n          Turn 61: move north to (6,2)\n          Turn 62: move north to (6,3)\n          Turn 63: move west to (5,3)\n          Turn 64: move west to (4,3) -> now at (4,3)\n          Turn 65: change orientation to north (U) to face (4,4)\n          Turn 66: interact to get onion from dispenser.\n\n        Then she can go back to the pot.\n\n        This will take until turn 70 or more.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that we are only planning for H=20 turns (up to turn 69), we may not complete the soup.\n\n        Therefore, a more efficient strategy is needed.\n\n        One efficient strategy: since there are two onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), and they are close to each other, we can have one player (Alice) collect onions from the dispenser and put them in the pot.\n\n        Alice at (4,1) -> can she go to (4,4) quickly? Let's calculate a path:\n\n          (4,1) to (4,2) is blocked. So she must go east or west.\n          Go east to (5,1) -> then north to (5,2) blocked -> east to (6,1) -> north to (6,2) -> north to (6,3) -> west to (5,3) -> north to (5,4) is blocked -> west to (4,3) -> then north to (4,4) is blocked, but she can interact from (4,3) facing north.\n\n        So from (4,1):\n          Turn 49: R to (5,1)\n          Turn 50: R to (6,1)\n          Turn 51: U to (6,2)\n          Turn 52: U to (6,3)\n          Turn 53: L to (5,3)\n          Turn 54: L to (4,3)\n          Turn 55: U (face north) \n          Turn 56: I (get onion from dispenser at (4,4)) -> holding onion.\n\n        Then she needs to deliver it to the pot at (4,0):\n\n          From (4,3) holding onion:\n          Turn 57: D (face south) \n          Turn 58: D (move south to (4,2)? -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter, non-walkable. So cannot.\n          Instead, move west to (3,3) [action: L] -> turn 57: move west to (3,3)\n          Then move south to (3,2) is blocked.\n          So move to (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> then interact with pot at (3,0) or (4,0) from (3,1) or (4,1).\n\n        This is long.\n\n        From (4,3) to (4,0) is not direct because (4,2) is blocked. So she must go east to (5,3) -> south to (5,2) blocked -> east to (6,3) -> south to (6,2) -> south to (6,1) -> west to (5,1) -> south to (5,0) blocked -> west to (4,1) -> then interact with (4,0) from (4,1) facing south.\n\n        Steps from (4,3) to (4,1):\n          Turn 57: move south to (4,2) -> blocked.\n          So: \n          Turn 57: move east to (5,3) [R]\n          Turn 58: move south to (5,2) -> blocked. -> cannot.\n          Therefore, only the long way around.\n\n Given the time constraints, and since we are only to plan for Alice (and optionally Bob), and the horizon is not specified, but we are to maximize the reward, perhaps we should aim for a shorter-term goal.\n\n        Let's aim to have the first onion in the pot within the next few turns.\n\n        Simplest: Alice delivers the onion from (5,2) to the pot at (4,0) in 4 turns ( turn 49-52 for Alice) as before.\n\n        Then, for the second onion, use the onion at (6,0) which is closer.\n\n        Alice after turn 54 ( after delivering the first onion) is at (4,1) facing down.\n\n        Then:\n          Turn 55: move east to (5,1) [R]\n          Turn 56: move east to (6,1) [R]\n          Turn 57: face down (D) ( to interact with (6,0))\n          Turn 58: interact to pick up onion from (6,0) -> holding onion.\n          Turn 59: move west to (5,1) [L]\n          Turn 60: move west to (4,1) [L]\n          Turn 61: face down (D) (already down? no, after moving west, she is facing west. So need to face down)\n          Turn 61: face down (D)\n          Turn 62: interact to put onion in pot -> now two onions.\n\n        Then for the third onion, she can try to get it from a dispenser or from (5,4) but (5,4) is not reachable quickly.\n\n        Bob can help with the third onion.\n\n        Bob is at (2,3) at turn 52 ( if he moved there in turn 50 and has been static) or we can plan for him to go to the dispenser.\n\n        At turn 49, Bob picks up onion from (3,2) -> holding onion.\n        At turn 50, Bob moves east to (4,3) -> to deliver to (4,2) as before.\n        At turn 51, faces south (D)\n        At turn 52, places onion on (4,2) -> empty-handed.\n        Then at turn 53, he can move east to (5,3) [R]\n        Turn 54: move north to (5,4) is blocked, so move east to (6,3) [R]\n        Turn 55: move north to (6,4) is blocked (kitchen counter), so move south to (6,2) [D] -> empty.\n        Turn 56: move west to (5,2) -> is a kitchen counter, cannot. \n        This is not working.\n\n        Alternatively, from (4,3) after delivering the onion at (4,2) ( at turn 52), he can go to the onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4) to get a new onion.\n\n        For example, to (4,4): from (4,3) he can face north and interact.\n          Turn 53: change orientation to north (U) \n          Turn 54: interact to get onion from (4,4) -> holding onion.\n        Then he needs to deliver it to the pot. He can go to (4,2) is blocked, so down to (4,2) cannot. He must go the long way or place it on a counter.\n\n        He can place it on the kitchen counter at (5,2) if it's empty? (5,2) was emptied by Alice at turn 51. So it's empty.\n\n        To place on (5,2): from (4,3) holding onion, he can move east to (5,3) [R] -> turn 53: move to (5,3)\n          Turn 54: face south (D) to face (5,2)\n          Turn 55: interact to place onion on (5,2) -> empty-handed.\n\n        Then Alice can pick it up.\n\n        Alice at turn 62: has just put the second onion in the pot, at (4,1) facing down.\n        Then at turn 63: move east to (5,1) [R]\n        Turn 64: face down (D) ( to interact with (5,2))\n        Turn 65: interact to pick up the onion from (5,2) -> holding onion.\n        Turn 66: move west to (4,1) [L]\n        Turn 67: face down (D) ( if not already)\n        Turn 68: interact to put in the pot -> now three onions in the pot.\n\n        Then the pot will start cooking at turn 68. It will be ready at turn 68 + 5 = turn 73.\n\n        Then we need to serve it.\n\n        So within our planning horizon of 20 turns (up to turn 69), we won't see the delivery.\n\n        Therefore, for the next 20 turns, we can only get the pot to have three onions and start cooking.\n\n        So the plan for the next 20 turns ( turn 49 to 68) is to have Alice and Bob work to put three onions in the pot at (4,0).\n\n        Given the complexity, and to within the turns, I will write the plan for Alice and Bob for the next 20 turns.\n\n        However, the problem asks for a sequence of actions for Alice ( and optionally Bob). Since it's collaboration, we should plan for both.\n\n        Let's outline the turns:\n\n        Turn 49:\n          Alice: R ( to (5,1) )\n          Bob: I ( to pick up onion from (3,2) ) -> holding onion.\n\n        Turn 50:\n          Alice: D ( face down to (5,2) )\n          Bob: R ( move east to (4,3) ) -> now at (4,3), holding onion.\n\n        Turn 51:\n          Alice: I ( pick up onion from (5,2) ) -> holding onion.\n          Bob: D ( face south to (4,2) )\n\n        Turn 52:\n          Alice: L ( move west to (4,1) ) -> holding onion, now at (4,1), orientation west.\n          Bob: I ( place onion on (4,2) ) -> empty-handed.\n\n        Turn 53:\n          Alice: D ( face down to (4,0) )\n          Bob: U ( face north to (4,4) ) \n\n        Turn 54:\n          Alice: I ( put onion in pot at (4,0) ) -> empty-handed.\n          Bob: I ( interact with (4,4) to get onion ) -> holding onion.\n\n        Turn 55:\n          Alice: R ( move east to (5,1) ) -> empty-handed.\n          Bob: R ( move east to (5,3) ) -> holding onion.\n\n        Turn 56:\n          Alice: R ( move east to (6,1) ) \n          Bob: D ( face south to (5,2) ) \n\n        Turn 57:\n          Alice: D ( face down to (6,0) )\n          Bob: I ( place onion on (5,2) ) -> empty-handed.\n\n        Turn 58:\n          Alice: I ( pick up onion from (6,0) ) -> holding onion.\n          Bob: ... we can have Bob stay or prepare for the next step.\n\n        Turn 59:\n          Alice: L ( move west to (5,1) ) -> holding onion.\n          Bob: S ( stay ) \n\n        Turn 60:\n          Alice: L ( move west to (4,1) ) -> holding onion.\n          Bob: S \n\n        Turn 61:\n          Alice: D ( face down to (4,0) ) \n          Bob: S \n\n        Turn 62:\n          Alice: I ( put onion in pot ) -> empty-handed. Now the pot has two onions.\n\n        Turn 63:\n          Alice: R ( move east to (5,1) ) \n          Bob: S \n\n        Turn 64:\n          Alice: D ( face down to (5,2) ) \n          Bob: S \n\n        Turn 65:\n          Alice: I ( pick up onion from (5,2) ) -> holding onion.\n          Bob: S \n\n        Turn 66:\n          Alice: L ( move west to (4,1) ) \n          Bob: S \n\n        Turn 67:\n          Alice: D ( face down ) \n          Bob: S \n\n        Turn 68:\n          Alice: I ( put onion in pot ) -> now three onions, cooking starts.\n\n        This is 20 actions for Alice from turn 49 to turn 68.\n\n        For Bob, after turn 57, he is free. We can have him help with other things, but since we are only to 20 turns, and the third onion is from the counter ( placed by him at (5,2) in turn 57), we have him stay.\n\n        So the plan is:\n\n        We are at turn 49.\n\n        Alice's actions:\n          turn 49: R\n          turn 50: D\n          turn 51: I\n          turn 52: L\n          turn 53: D\n          turn 54: I\n          turn 55: R\n          turn 56: R\n          turn 57: D\n          turn 58: I\n          turn 59: L\n          turn 60: L\n          turn 61: D\n          turn 62: I\n          turn 63: R\n          turn 64: D\n          turn 65: I\n          turn 66: L\n          turn 67: D\n          turn 68: I\n\n        Bob's actions:\n          turn 49: I\n          turn 50: R\n          turn 51: D\n          turn 52: I\n          turn 53: U\n          turn 54: I\n          turn 55: R\n          turn 56: D\n          turn 57: I\n          turn 58: S\n          turn 59: S\n          turn 60: S\n          turn 61: S\n          turn 62: S\n          turn 63: S\n          turn 64: S\n          turn 65: S\n          turn 66: S\n          turn 67: S\n          turn 68: S\n\n        This completes the plan for 20 turns.\n\n        We have to output only for Alice? The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can output both.\n\n        But the answer format only shows one player? Let me check.\n\n        The answer format is:\n          Turn t1: a_{t1}\n          ...\n\n        And it says \"for Alice\", so maybe only Alice. But optionally Bob, so we can include.\n\n        However, the format does not specify the player. So perhaps we need to output for both in one plan? But the format is per turn one action.\n\n        The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice ( and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both, but the output should be clear.\n\n        Since the format is only one action per turn, it implies we are to output for one player (Alice) only. \n\n        Therefore, I will output only Alice's actions.\n\n        Alice's actions for turns 49 to 68 as above.\n\n        But note: the turns start at t1=49, and we are planning for the next H turns. Let's say H=20, so from turn 49 to turn 68 inclusive (20 actions).\n\n        Therefore:\n\n        Turn 49: R\n        Turn 50: D\n        Turn 51: I\n        Turn 52: L\n        Turn 53: D\n        Turn 54: I\n        Turn 55: R\n        Turn 56: R\n        Turn 57: D\n        Turn 58: I\n        Turn 59: L\n        Turn 60: L\n        Turn 61: D\n        Turn 62: I\n        Turn 63: R\n        Turn 64: D\n        Turn 65: I\n        Turn 66: L\n        Turn 67: D\n        Turn 68: I\n\n        This is for Alice.\n\n        We assume Bob will do his part as described.\n\n        This is the best we can do within the turns.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob will collaborate to prepare and deliver a 3-onion soup. The pot at (4,0) will be used, requiring three onions. Alice will handle retrieving onions from (5,2) and (6,0), while Bob retrieves an onion from (3,2) and places it on (5,2) for Alice to use later. Alice will then add all three onions to the pot.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 49 to 68)\n- **Turn 49 (R)**: Move right to (5,1) to approach (5,2).\n- **Turn 50 (D)**: Face down to interact with (5,2).\n- **Turn 51 (I)**: Pick up onion from (5,2).\n- **Turn 52 (L)**: Move west to (4,1) to approach the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 53 (D)**: Face down to interact with the pot.\n- **Turn 54 (I)**: Place onion in the pot (now has 1 onion).\n- **Turn 55 (R)**: Move east to (5,1) to approach (6,0).\n- **Turn 56 (R)**: Move east to (6,1) to approach (6,0).\n- **Turn 57 (D)**: Face down to interact with (6,0).\n- **Turn 58 (I)**: Pick up onion from (6,0).\n- **Turn 59 (L)**: Move west to (5,1) to return to the pot area.\n- **Turn 60 (L)**: Move west to (4,1) to reach the pot.\n- **Turn 61 (D)**: Face down to interact with the pot.\n- **Turn 62 (I)**: Place onion in the pot (now has 2 onions).\n- **Turn 63 (R)**: Move east to (5,1) to approach (5,2) (where Bob placed an onion).\n- **Turn 64 (D)**: Face down to interact with (5,2).\n- **Turn 65 (I)**: Pick up onion from (5,2) (placed by Bob).\n- **Turn 66 (L)**: Move west to (4,1) to return to the pot.\n- **Turn 67 (D)**: Face down to interact with the pot.\n- **Turn 68 (I)**: Place onion in the pot (now has 3 onions; cooking starts).\n\n### Bob's Role (Collaboration)\n- **Turn 49 (I)**: Pick up onion from (3,2).\n- **Turn 50 (R)**: Move east to (4,3).\n- **Turn 51 (D)**: Face down to interact with (4,2).\n- **Turn 52 (I)**: Place onion on (4,2) (temporarily stored).\n- **Turn 53 (U)**: Face up to interact with (4,4) (onion dispenser).\n- **Turn 54 (I)**: Pick up onion from dispenser.\n- **Turn 55 (R)**: Move east to (5,3) to approach (5,2).\n- **Turn 56 (D)**: Face down to interact with (5,2).\n- **Turn 57 (I)**: Place onion on (5,2) (for Alice to pick up later).\n- Bob then stays (S) for subsequent turns to avoid interference.\n\nThis plan ensures the pot starts cooking at turn 68, with delivery possible after 5 turns (turn 73). The coordination maximizes efficiency, utilizing existing onions and dispensers.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 53. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes.\n\nFirst, note the recipe: Recipe 1 requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives 20 reward.\n\nKey elements:\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter at (7,2)\n- Kitchen counters with onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2) -> but note that (5,4) is a kitchen counter? Actually, (5,4) is listed as a kitchen counter and has an onion.\n\nPlayer states:\n- Alice (me) at (4,1) facing right, holding nothing.\n- Bob at (3,3) facing up, holding nothing.\n\nSince the pots are empty, we need to start by putting onions into a pot. We can use the onions on the kitchen counters to save time.\n\nPlan:\n1. We need to get 3 onions into one of the pots (either (3,0) or (4,0)).\n2. Then, let the pot cook for 5 turns (it will start automatically when the third onion is added).\n3. While the soup is cooking, we can prepare plates and be ready to serve.\n\nBut note: we have onions already on kitchen counters. So we don't necessarily need to go to the onion dispenser.\n\nLet's see the positions:\n\nAlice at (4,1) is close to the pots (3,0) and (4,0) and also to the kitchen counters that have onions.\n\nBob at (3,3) is near the onion dispensers and some kitchen counters.\n\nWe have onions at:\n- (5,2): kitchen counter\n- (5,4): kitchen counter\n- (6,0): kitchen counter\n- (2,2): kitchen counter\n- (3,2): kitchen counter\n\nWe can use these onions to fill the pot.\n\nSteps for Alice:\n- Alice is at (4,1). She can move down to (4,0) to get to the pot? But note: (4,0) is a pot. She cannot stand on the pot. She must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n\nTo interact with the pot at (4,0), she must be on an adjacent empty tile and face the pot. The adjacent tiles to (4,0) are: (3,0) [pot, not empty], (5,0) [kitchen counter, not empty], (4,1) [where she is] and (4,-1) [which is out of bounds?]. So she can only access the pot from (4,1) by facing down? But (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0) and she is at (4,1). So she can interact with (4,0) by facing down and pressing I.\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (3,0): adjacent tiles are (2,0) [kitchen counter], (4,0) [pot], (3,1) [empty?] and (3,-1) [out]. So from (3,1) facing down, or from (4,0) but that's a pot so not walkable. So (3,1) is a good spot.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (4,1) facing right. She can turn down (D) to face the pot at (4,0). Then she can interact to add an onion if she has one. But she doesn't have one now.\n\nSo Alice needs to pick up an onion first.\n\nThe closest onion to Alice is at (3,2) or (5,2) or (6,0). \n- (3,2): kitchen counter. To get there from (4,1): she can move left to (3,1) and then down? But (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2) which is south? Actually, (3,2) is south of (3,1). So from (3,1) facing down (D) she can interact with the counter at (3,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nAlternatively, she can go to (5,2) from (4,1) by moving right to (5,1) then down to (5,2). But (5,1) is not given as any special tile, so it's empty? We don't have a grid map, but we know the tile types. The kitchen counters are listed, so (5,1) is not in the kitchen counter list, so it should be empty. Similarly, (3,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it's empty.\n\nBut note: (5,0) is a kitchen counter and (5,2) is a kitchen counter. So (5,1) must be an empty tile? Similarly, (3,1) is between (3,0) [pot] and (3,2) [kitchen counter] so it should be empty.\n\nSo Alice can:\nOption 1: \n- Move left to (3,1) [action L]. Then she is at (3,1) facing left? Actually, moving left changes position to (3,1) and orientation to left. Then she needs to face down to interact with (3,2). So after moving to (3,1), she can change orientation to down (D) and then interact (I).\n\nOption 2:\n- Move right to (5,1) [action R], then move down to (5,2) [action D]. Then she is at (5,2) but (5,2) is a kitchen counter? No, she cannot stand on a kitchen counter. So she must stand adjacent and face it. Actually, she can only interact with a kitchen counter if she is adjacent and facing it. So if she moves to (5,1) and then faces down (D), then she can interact with the counter at (5,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nBut note: the onion at (5,2) is on the kitchen counter. So she can pick it up.\n\nSimilarly, for Bob: he is at (3,3) facing up. He can help by getting onions and putting them in the pot.\n\nWe have two pots. We can use one pot for a soup.\n\nLet's assign:\n\nAlice will get an onion from a nearby kitchen counter and put it in the pot at (4,0). Then she can get another onion and put it, and then a third.\n\nBut we have multiple onions available. Also, Bob can help.\n\nAlternatively, we can have both players work together to fill one pot quickly.\n\nBut note: the pot starts cooking automatically when the third ingredient is added. So we want to put three onions in the same pot.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n\nFirst, let Alice pick up an onion from (3,2) because it's the closest.\n\nSteps for Alice (starting at (4,1) facing right):\n1. Move left to (3,1) -> action L. Now at (3,1) facing left.\n2. Change orientation to down (so she can interact with (3,2)) -> action D. Now facing down.\n3. Interact to pick up the onion from (3,2) -> action I. Now holding an onion.\n\nThen, she needs to put it in a pot. The pot at (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1). From (3,1) facing down, she is not facing the pot at (3,0) which is north? (3,0) is above (3,1). So she needs to face up.\n\n4. Change orientation to up (U) -> action U. Now facing up.\n5. Interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0) -> action I. Now the pot at (3,0) has one onion. Alice is holding nothing.\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1) and (4,0) and (2,0) [kitchen counter]. So (3,1) is adjacent and facing up will interact with (3,0).\n\nAlternatively, she could use the pot at (4,0). From (3,1), she can move right to (4,1) and then face down to interact with (4,0). But that would take more steps.\n\nSo using (3,0) is efficient.\n\nNow, after putting one onion, she can get another onion. The onion at (3,2) is gone? When she picked it up, the kitchen counter at (3,2) becomes empty. So she cannot get another from there. She must go to another counter.\n\nNext closest: (2,2) or (5,2). (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1) [which is empty?] and (2,3) [unknown]. From (3,1), she can move left to (2,1) [if it's empty] then face down to interact with (2,2). But we don't know if (2,1) is empty. The tile types: (2,0) is kitchen counter, (2,2) is kitchen counter, so (2,1) should be empty.\n\nSo:\n6. From (3,1) after putting the onion, she can move left to (2,1) -> action L. Now at (2,1) facing left? (since she moved left from (3,1)).\n7. Then face down (D) to face (2,2) -> action D.\n8. Interact to pick up onion from (2,2) -> action I. Now holding onion.\n\nThen, she needs to put it in the same pot at (3,0). So she must go back to (3,1) and face up.\n\n9. Move right to (3,1) -> action R. Now at (3,1) facing right? (because she moved right).\n10. Change orientation to up (U) -> action U.\n11. Interact to put onion in pot at (3,0) -> action I. Now the pot has two onions.\n\nThen, she needs a third onion. The next closest might be (5,2) or (6,0). (6,0) is a kitchen counter, but it's at (6,0) which is near the top. From (3,1) to (6,0): that's 3 steps right and 1 step down? But she is at (3,1). She can move right to (4,1) [empty], then (5,1) [empty], then (6,1) [empty?]. Then from (6,1) she can face down to interact with (6,0). But (6,0) is a kitchen counter. So:\n\n12. Move right to (4,1) -> action R.\n13. Move right to (5,1) -> action R.\n14. Move right to (6,1) -> action R. Now at (6,1) facing right.\n15. Change orientation to down (D) to face (6,0) -> action D.\n16. Interact to pick up onion -> action I. Now holding onion.\n\nThen, she must go back to (3,0) to put the onion. That's 3 steps left and 1 step up? But she is at (6,1). To (3,1) is 3 steps left, then face up and put.\n\n17. Move left to (5,1) -> action L.\n18. Move left to (4,1) -> action L.\n19. Move left to (3,1) -> action L. Now at (3,1) facing left.\n20. Change orientation to up (U) -> action U.\n21. Interact to put onion in pot -> action I. Now the pot has three onions and starts cooking.\n\nBut note: this is 21 actions for Alice alone. And we haven't used Bob. Also, we have Bob available.\n\nMoreover, we have onions at (5,4) and (5,2) and (3,2) is already used. But (3,2) was used first, then (2,2), then (6,0). But (5,2) is closer to the starting point of Alice? Actually, after the first onion, when she is at (3,1) after putting the first onion, she could go to (5,2) for the second onion.\n\nLet's re-optimize with Bob.\n\nBob is at (3,3) facing up. He can help by getting an onion and putting it in the pot.\n\nBob's position: (3,3). Adjacent to (3,4) which is an onion dispenser? But we don't need to go to the dispenser because we have onions on counters. The closest onion to Bob: (3,2) is just below him. But (3,2) is one step below (3,3). So he can face down and interact to pick up the onion? But wait, (3,2) is a kitchen counter. He must be adjacent and facing it. He is at (3,3) which is adjacent to (3,2) (south). He is facing up, so he must turn to face down.\n\nSteps for Bob at turn 53:\n1. Change orientation to down (D) -> action D. Now facing down.\n2. Interact to pick up onion from (3,2) -> action I. Now holding an onion.\n\nThen, he can put it in the pot at (3,0). But he is at (3,3). He needs to go to (3,1) to interact with (3,0). So:\n3. Move down to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? He cannot walk onto it. So he must go around? Actually, to get to (3,1) from (3,3): he can move down to (3,2) only if it's walkable? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty? Actually, the kitchen counter is a tile that you can walk on? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the kitchen counter is a tile type that is non-empty? Actually, the tile types are given, and kitchen counters are listed as non-empty when they have an item. But even when empty, they are still counters and not walkable? The rules say: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" So kitchen counters are not walkable, regardless of whether they have an item or not.\n\nSo Bob cannot walk through (3,2). He must go around. The alternative is to go to (4,3) then down to (4,2) [which is a kitchen counter? (4,2) is listed as a kitchen counter, so not walkable] or to (2,3) then down? We don't know the map fully.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counters are at specific positions. The empty tiles are not listed. So we must assume that the only non-empty tiles are the ones listed. Therefore, (3,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable. Similarly, (4,2) is a kitchen counter. So Bob at (3,3) cannot move down because (3,2) is blocked. He can only move left, right, or up? But (3,3) is at the top? Let's see the grid.\n\nWe have:\n- (3,4) is an onion dispenser. So (3,4) is non-empty and not walkable? Actually, dispensers are non-empty and not walkable.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3) is surrounded: \n- North: (3,4) dispenser -> not walkable.\n- South: (3,2) kitchen counter -> not walkable.\n- East: (4,3) -> we don't know. If it's not listed as a non-empty tile, it should be empty and walkable.\n- West: (2,3) -> not listed as non-empty, so empty and walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move east to (4,3) or west to (2,3).\n\nTo get to the pot at (3,0), he must go to (3,1). But (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) and (3,2) [blocked]. So he can only approach (3,0) from (3,1) which is accessible via (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nSo Bob's path to the pot:\n- From (3,3): move west to (2,3) [action L]. Then move down to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter? Not walkable. So he must go to (2,1) first? How? From (2,3) he can move down to (2,2) only if it's walkable, but it's not. So he must go to (1,3) or (2,4) but we don't have information. Alternatively, he can go east to (4,3) and then down to (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter -> not walkable. Then down to (4,1) which is empty? Then to (4,0) is a pot, not walkable.\n\nThis is getting messy. Alternatively, Bob can use the pot at (4,0). He can go to (4,1) and face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nSo for Bob:\n1. Move east to (4,3) [action R] (since he is at (3,3) and facing up, but moving east changes orientation to right? Actually, moving changes position and orientation. So action R: moves to (4,3) and faces right.\n2. Then move down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Not walkable. So he cannot move down. He must go to (4,3) and then down? But (4,3) is at (4,3). The tile below (4,3) is (4,2) which is kitchen counter -> not walkable. So he cannot go down.\n\nTherefore, Bob is stuck at (3,3). He can only move to (2,3) or (4,3). From (4,3), he can move up? (4,4) is an onion dispenser, not walkable. Or down? blocked. So only left to (3,3) or right to (5,3)? But we don't know about (5,3). Similarly, from (2,3) he can move left to (1,3) or down to (2,2) blocked.\n\nIt seems the map is constrained. Bob might not be able to get to the pots easily. So perhaps Bob should focus on getting a plate or something else.\n\nBut note: there is an onion at (5,4) which is a kitchen counter. Bob is at (3,3). He can move to (4,3) then to (5,3) [if empty] and then to (5,4) but (5,4) is a kitchen counter, not walkable. So he can stand at (5,3) and face down to interact with (5,4) to pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, there is an onion at (5,2) but (5,2) is a kitchen counter. Bob at (5,3) can face down to interact with (5,2)? (5,2) is two steps below? No, (5,3) is adjacent to (5,2) to the south? Yes, (5,2) is directly below (5,3). So if Bob is at (5,3), he can face down to interact with (5,2).\n\nBut first, he needs to get to (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,3):\n- Move right to (4,3) [action R] -> now at (4,3) facing right.\n- Move right to (5,3) [action R] -> now at (5,3) facing right.\n\nThen he can:\n- Face down (D) to face (5,2) -> action D.\n- Interact to pick up onion from (5,2) -> action I. Now holding an onion.\n\nBut (5,2) has an onion? Yes, according to the state.\n\nThen he can put the onion in a pot. But he is at (5,3). The nearest pot is at (4,0) or (3,0). He can go to (4,1) and face down to interact with (4,0). How to get to (4,1)? From (5,3) to (5,2) is blocked, so he must go left to (4,3) then down? But (4,2) is blocked. So he must go to (4,3) then to (4,4)? (4,4) is an onion dispenser, blocked. Or to (3,3) then down? blocked.\n\nAlternatively, he can go to (5,3) to (6,3) if possible? We don't know. Or to (5,4) but (5,4) is a kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo Bob is stuck in the top area. He cannot easily get to the pots. Therefore, it might be better for Bob to get a plate and be ready to serve.\n\nPlate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (5,3). How to get to (0,2)? That's a long path, and we don't know the full map. But note the kitchen counters are obstacles.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only planning for a few turns (H turns, but H is not specified, so we must plan for a reasonable number, say 10-20 turns), and the soup takes 5 turns to cook, we need to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nSo let's focus on Alice filling the pot.\n\nAlice at (4,1) facing right:\n\nTurn 53: \n- Alice: move left to (3,1) [L]\n- Bob: since he is stuck, maybe move to a better position? But we have to specify an action for Bob. We can plan for Alice and suggest Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice and optionally Bob. But the answer format only has actions for Alice? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? Let me read: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: a_{t1} ... }\" and it says \"for Alice\", so I think we only need to output Alice's actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we might need to consider Bob's actions to avoid conflicts. However, the output format only shows Alice's actions. So we plan Alice's actions assuming Bob will cooperate appropriately.\n\nBut in the answer, we only write Alice's actions.\n\nSo we ignore Bob for the action output, but we must consider his presence to avoid collisions.\n\nHowever, Bob is at (3,3) and Alice is at (4,1) and moving to (3,1), so they are not in the same position. So no collision.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 53: L (move left to (3,1), now facing left)\n\nThen, she needs to pick up the onion at (3,2). So she must face down.\n\nTurn 54: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 55: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nNow she has an onion.\n\nThen, she needs to put it in the pot at (3,0). So she must face up.\n\nTurn 56: U (change orientation to up)\n\nTurn 57: I (interact to put onion in pot at (3,0))\n\nNow the pot has one onion.\n\nThen, she needs another onion. The next closest is (2,2) or (5,2). (2,2) is closer: from (3,1), move left to (2,1) [if empty].\n\nTurn 58: L (move left to (2,1), now facing left)\n\nThen, face down to interact with (2,2).\n\nTurn 59: D (face down)\n\nTurn 60: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen, go back to (3,1) to put in the same pot.\n\nTurn 61: R (move right to (3,1), now facing right)\n\nTurn 62: U (face up)\n\nTurn 63: I (put onion in pot at (3,0)) -> now pot has two onions.\n\nThen, she needs a third onion. The next closest is (5,2). She is at (3,1). She can go to (5,1) and face down to pick up from (5,2).\n\nTurn 64: R (move right to (4,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 65: R (move right to (5,1), facing right)\n\nThen, face down to interact with (5,2).\n\nTurn 66: D (face down)\n\nTurn 67: I (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen, go back to (3,1) to put in the pot.\n\nTurn 68: L (move left to (4,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 69: L (move left to (3,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 70: U (face up)\n\nTurn 71: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has three onions and starts cooking at turn 71.\n\nThe cooking time is 5 turns, so it will be ready at turn 76.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can get a plate to serve the soup.\n\nPlate dispenser is at (0,2). She is at (3,1). She can go to (0,1) or (0,3) and face (0,2). But (0,2) is the plate dispenser. How to get there? From (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (0,1) [if all empty]. Then at (0,1) face right to interact with (0,2)? But (0,2) is east of (0,1). So:\n\nAfter putting the third onion at turn 71, she is at (3,1) facing up? After interacting, she is still at (3,1) and facing up.\n\nTurn 72: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 73: L (move left to (1,1), facing left) [assuming (1,1) is empty]\n\nTurn 74: L (move left to (0,1), facing left) -> but now at (0,1) and facing left. But the plate dispenser is at (0,2) which is east. So she must face right.\n\nTurn 75: R (change orientation to right) -> now facing right, adjacent to (0,2)\n\nTurn 76: I (interact to get a plate) -> now holding a clean plate.\n\nThen, she needs to go back to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup. But the soup is ready at turn 76. She can start moving back at turn 77.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (3,1): three steps right.\n\nTurn 77: R (move right to (1,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 78: R (move right to (2,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 79: R (move right to (3,1), facing right)\n\nThen, at (3,1), she must face up to interact with the pot at (3,0).\n\nTurn 80: U (face up)\n\nTurn 81: I (interact to serve the soup: she puts the plate in the pot and gets the soup) -> now holding a soup in a plate.\n\nThen, she must deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2): she can go right to (4,1), (5,1), then down to (5,2) but blocked, so go to (6,1), then to (7,1) [if empty], then face up to interact with (7,2). But (7,2) is the serving counter.\n\nPath:\n- From (3,1): move right to (4,1) [turn 82: R]\n- Then to (5,1) [turn 83: R]\n- Then to (6,1) [turn 84: R]\n- Then to (7,1) [turn 85: R] (assuming (7,1) is empty? It is not listed as a kitchen counter, so should be empty)\n- Then face up to interact with (7,2) [turn 86: U]\n- Then interact [turn 87: I] to deliver.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 76, and she is getting the plate at turn 76, then moving back and forth. This is taking many turns. Also, the soup might burn if not served? The rules don't say, so assume it doesn't burn.\n\nBut we are only planning for a few turns? The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We don't have a fixed H. We can output until she delivers, but that's 35 turns from turn 53. Alternatively, we might plan only until the soup is cooking and then get the plate, but we need to see the whole picture.\n\nAlso, Bob might be able to get the plate and serve. But Bob is stuck in the top. Alternatively, after the soup is cooking, Alice can get a plate and wait.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it faster.\n\nAnother idea: use the onion at (5,4) which is closer to Bob, but Bob is stuck. Or use the onion at (6,0) for the third onion.\n\nAfter Alice has two onions in the pot (at turn 63), she is at (3,1). Instead of going to (5,2), she can go to (6,0) for the onion.\n\nFrom (3,1):\n- Move right to (4,1) [action R]\n- Move right to (5,1) [action R]\n- Move right to (6,1) [action R]\n- Face down to interact with (6,0) [action D then I]\n\nThen back to (3,1) to put.\n\nThis is the same number of moves as going to (5,2). (5,2) is two steps right and one down? But she is already at (3,1), and (5,2) requires moving to (5,1) and facing down, so she doesn't move to (5,2). Similarly, (6,0) requires moving to (6,1) and facing down.\n\nDistance: to (5,2): from (3,1) to (5,1) is two right, then one interact (without moving). To (6,0): from (3,1) to (6,1) is three right, then one interact. So (5,2) is closer.\n\nBut note: after getting the onion from (5,2), she is at (5,1) and then she has to go back to (3,1) which is two left. For (6,0), she is at (6,1) and then three left to (3,1). So (5,2) is better.\n\nTherefore, the plan for Alice as above is reasonable.\n\nBut we must consider that the kitchen counter at (3,2) was used by Alice at turn 55, so it becomes empty. Similarly, (2,2) at turn 60, and (5,2) at turn 67.\n\nAlso, Bob might be moving. But since we are only outputting Alice's actions, we assume Bob doesn't block.\n\nSo for the next 20 turns or so, we can output Alice's actions until she gets the plate or something.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize the total reward, and we are only making one soup. We can make more, but one soup is 20 points, and it takes about 35 turns to deliver. But we are at turn 53, so by turn 88 we deliver one soup.\n\nAlternatively, after the soup is cooking, Alice can start preparing for the next soup. But since the pots are empty, we can use the other pot.\n\nBut let's output the actions for Alice for the next 10-15 turns first.\n\nWe'll output from turn 53 to, say, turn 67, which is when she picks up the third onion.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 53: L (to (3,1))\nTurn 54: D (face down)\nTurn 55: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 56: U (face up)\nTurn 57: I (put in pot (3,0))\nTurn 58: L (to (2,1))\nTurn 59: D (face down)\nTurn 60: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 61: R (to (3,1))\nTurn 62: U (face up)\nTurn 63: I (put in pot (3,0)) -> now two onions\nTurn 64: R (to (4,1))\nTurn 65: R (to (5,1))\nTurn 66: D (face down)\nTurn 67: I (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nThen, she needs to put it in the pot:\n\nTurn 68: L (to (4,1))\nTurn 69: L (to (3,1))\nTurn 70: U (face up)\nTurn 71: I (put in pot) -> soup starts cooking at turn 71.\n\nThen she can go for a plate, but that's beyond our initial output. Since the problem says \"over next several turns\", we can output until turn 71 or a bit more.\n\nBut let's output until she puts the third onion, i.e., turn 71.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice from turn 53 to turn 71:\n\nTurn 53: L\nTurn 54: D\nTurn 55: I\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: I\nTurn 58: L\nTurn 59: D\nTurn 60: I\nTurn 61: R\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: I\nTurn 64: R\nTurn 65: R\nTurn 66: D\nTurn 67: I\nTurn 68: L\nTurn 69: L\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: I\n\nThis is 19 actions (from turn 53 to turn 71, inclusive, is 71-53+1=19 turns).\n\nBut we started at turn 53, so the first action is for turn 53, then 54, ..., up to turn 71.\n\nWe can also consider that Bob might have picked up an onion and put it in the pot, but since he is stuck, it's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, after the soup is cooking, Alice can immediately go for a plate to be ready.\n\nBut for now, this plan gets the soup cooking as soon as possible.\n\nSo we'll output the above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver an onion soup (Recipe 1: 3 onions, 5-turn cook time, 20 reward). Given the current state, Alice is best positioned to gather onions from kitchen counters and fill the pot at (3, 0), while Bob (though constrained by the map) should focus on supporting or preparing for serving. However, since the task requires only Alice's actions, the plan below optimizes her path to collect onions and fill the pot efficiently, minimizing turns. Bob's actions are not output but should avoid conflicts; he could, for example, attempt to fetch a plate later.\n\n### **Optimal Action Sequence for Alice (Turns 53 to 71)**\n- **Goal**: Collect 3 onions from kitchen counters (starting with closest) and deposit them into the pot at (3, 0) to start cooking by turn 71. Cooking completes at turn 76, after which Alice/Bob can serve (not covered here).\n- **Path Rationale**:  \n  - **Turns 53–57**: Alice moves to (3, 1), picks up onion from (3, 2), and deposits it into pot (3, 0).  \n  - **Turns 58–63**: Alice moves to (2, 1), picks up onion from (2, 2), returns to (3, 1), and deposits second onion.  \n  - **Turns 64–71**: Alice moves to (5, 1), picks up onion from (5, 2), returns to (3, 1), and deposits third onion (soup starts cooking).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 53: L \\\\\nTurn 54: D \\\\\nTurn 55: I \\\\\nTurn 56: U \\\\\nTurn 57: I \\\\\nTurn 58: L \\\\\nTurn 59: D \\\\\nTurn 60: I \\\\\nTurn 61: R \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: I \\\\\nTurn 64: R \\\\\nTurn 65: R \\\\\nTurn 66: D \\\\\nTurn 67: I \\\\\nTurn 68: L \\\\\nTurn 69: L \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: I\n}",

H isn't specified, but since cooking takes 5 turns, I should plan for at least that long to complete a soup. Let's say H=10 for now to cover multiple actions.\n\nGoal: make and deliver onion soup for reward.\n\nSince pots need 3 onions, and there are onions on counters, we might not need to grab from dispensers immediately.\n\nList the onions available:\n\n- On counters: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2). That's 5 onions.\n\nBob is holding one onion, so total onions available: 6. But we need 3 per soup.\n\nPots are empty, so we need to fill a pot with 3 onions.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nBob is at (4,3), holding an onion.\n\nTo interact with a pot, player must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nFor pot at (3,0): adjacent tiles are above (3,1), left (2,0), right (4,0), but (4,0) is another pot, not empty. Tiles: let's sketch the grid.\n\nI should understand the layout.\n\nTile types:\n\n- Kitchen counters: (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(5,0),(6,0),(7,0),(0,1),(7,1),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(0,3),(7,3),(0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(5,4),(6,4),(7,4)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4),(4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0),(4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nAnd empty tiles elsewhere, I assume.\n\nPlayers can only walk on empty tiles or interact from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nAlice at (3,1): what is (3,1)? Not listed as kitchen counter, etc., so probably empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (4,3): not listed, so empty.\n\nPot at (3,0): to interact, player needs to be on adjacent tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,0): up is (3,1), down is out of bound? Assume grid is 0 to 7 in x, 0 to 4 in y? Not specified, but from coordinates, y=0 to 4 probably.\n\n(3,0) adjacent:\n\n- North: (3,1) - which is empty, Alice is there.\n\n- South: (3,-1) invalid\n\n- East: (4,0) - pot, not empty, so cannot stand there\n\n- West: (2,0) - kitchen counter, not empty, cannot stand\n\nSo the only adjacent empty tile is (3,1) to the north.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0):\n\n- North: (4,1) - not listed, so empty?\n\n(4,1) not in kitchen counter list, so empty tile.\n\n- South: invalid\n\n- East: (5,0) - kitchen counter, not empty\n\n- West: (3,0) - pot, not empty\n\nSo adjacent empty tile for (4,0) is (4,1) to the north.\n\nNow, to interact with pot, player must be on (3,1) and facing south for pot (3,0), or on (4,1) and facing south for pot (4,0).\n\nFacing: since pot is south, player needs to face down.\n\nIn this case, for (3,0), from (3,1), facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0) from (4,1).\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,1), facing left. She is on (3,1), which is adjacent to pot (3,0) to the south. But she is facing left, not down, so to interact with pot, she needs to face down.\n\nShe can change orientation or move.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (4,3), holding an onion.\n\nWe need to put onions into a pot.\n\nFirst, let's get a pot started.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is above pot (3,0). She needs to face down to interact.\n\nCurrent orientation left, so she can change orientation to down.\n\nThen interact to add ingredient, but she is holding nothing, so she can't add anything. She needs to have an onion to add.\n\nSo Alice should go get an onion.\n\nThere are onions on counters.\n\nCounters with onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nAlice is at (3,1). (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, and it's directly above her at (3,2), which is one tile north? Positions: (3,1) to (3,2) is up, y+1.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter with onion.\n\nTo interact with (3,2), Alice must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,2): north (3,3), south (3,1), east (4,2), west (2,2).\n\n(3,3) not listed, probably empty.\n\n(3,1) is empty, Alice is there.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter, but it has no item? Kitchen counter at (4,2) is listed, but in non-empty counters, (4,2) is not mentioned as having an item, so it might be empty.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters: (5,2) has onion, (5,4) has onion, (6,0) has onion, (2,2) has onion, (3,2) has onion. So (4,2) is a kitchen counter but no item, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, other counters may be empty.\n\nFor (3,2), adjacent empty tiles: (3,1) south, (3,3) north, (4,2) east but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not empty tile? Kitchen counter is a tile type, but players cannot walk onto it; they can only interact from adjacent.\n\nTile types: Empty Tile is walkable, others are not walkable; players must be on empty tile to interact with adjacent non-empty tile.\n\nSo for kitchen counter at (3,2), it is non-empty, so players cannot walk on it; must be on adjacent empty tile.\n\nAdjacent positions: (3,1) south, (3,3) north, (4,2) east, but (4,2) is also a kitchen counter tile, which is not walkable, so not empty. Similarly, (2,2) west is kitchen counter with item, not walkable.\n\nSo the adjacent walkable tiles for (3,2) are:\n\n- South: (3,1) - empty\n\n- North: (3,3) - not listed, so empty\n\n- East: (4,2) is kitchen counter, not empty tile\n\n- West: (2,2) is kitchen counter, not empty tile\n\nTherefore, only (3,1) and (3,3) are adjacent empty tiles where a player can stand to interact with (3,2).\n\nSimilarly for other objects.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is directly south of (3,2). To interact, she needs to face north (up), since (3,2) is north of her.\n\nCurrent orientation left, so she needs to face up.\n\nThen she can interact to pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nSince she is empty-handed, she can pick it up.\n\nSo Alice can do: change orientation to U (up), then interact to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), she is at (3,1), facing up, so yes.\n\nThen she has an onion.\n\nThen she can go to the pot to add it.\n\nPot (3,0) is south of her at (3,1). She is at (3,1), pot at (3,0) south. To interact, she needs to face down.\n\nAfter picking up onion, she is at (3,1), holding onion. She can face down (D), then interact to add onion to pot.\n\nBut the pot is empty, so adding one onion will start it, but it needs three.\n\nCurrently, pot has nothing.\n\nBob is holding an onion at (4,3).\n\nHe can add it to a pot.\n\nFor pot (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nBut Alice is there now, and players cannot occupy the same tile.\n\nSo only one can be at (3,1) at a time.\n\nSimilarly, for pot (4,0), he can be at (4,1) facing down.\n\n(4,1) is empty, I think.\n\nBob is at (4,3), facing right.\n\nHe can move to add his onion.\n\nFirst, let's plan for Alice.\n\nAt turn 55, Alice should start by facing up to interact with (3,2).\n\nAction: change orientation to U.\n\nThen, interact to pick up onion.\n\nBut actions are per turn, so each action is one turn.\n\nTurn 55: Alice action.\n\nI need to output actions starting from turn t1=55.\n\nSo for turn 55: action for Alice.\n\nShe is at (3,1), facing left. To pick up from (3,2) north, she needs to face up.\n\nSo first, change orientation to U.\n\nThat can be one action.\n\nTurn 55: U (change orientation to up)\n\nThen, at turn 56, she can interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nNow she is holding an onion.\n\nThen, to add to pot, she needs to face down to interact with (3,0).\n\nShe is facing up, so she needs to change orientation to down.\n\nTurn 57: D (change to down)\n\nThen turn 58: I (interact to add onion to pot (3,0))\n\nNow pot (3,0) has one onion.\n\nBob has an onion at (4,3).\n\nHe can go to a pot to add it.\n\nFor pot (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1), but Alice might be there or not.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) after adding, I think.\n\nAfter turn 58, Alice is at (3,1), facing down, just added onion.\n\nShe can move or stay.\n\nBut to let Bob add, she should move away.\n\nThere is another pot at (4,0), or he can add to (3,0) if Alice moves.\n\nBut let's see Bob's position.\n\nBob at (4,3), facing right.\n\nTo add to pot (4,0), he can go to (4,1) and face down.\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nFirst, he needs to go down from (4,3).\n\nMove down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nPositions: (4,3) to (4,2): (4,2) is kitchen counter tile, cannot walk on it.\n\nAdjacent empty tiles: from (4,3), north (4,4) but (4,4) is onion dispenser, not empty.\n\n(4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSouth: (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nEast: (5,3) - not listed, probably empty.\n\nWest: (3,3) - not listed, probably empty.\n\nSo Bob can move west to (3,3) or east to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) is north of (3,2), which has onion but Alice just took it? At turn 58, Alice picked onion from (3,2) at turn 56, so (3,2) is now empty? When she picks up, the counter becomes empty.\n\nAfter Alice interacts at turn 56 to pick up, (3,2) has no item now.\n\nBut it's still a kitchen counter tile, just empty.\n\nFor movement, players can only walk on empty tiles, not on counters or dispensers.\n\nSo from (4,3), Bob can move to adjacent empty tiles.\n\n(4,3) has:\n\n- North: (4,4) - onion dispenser, not walkable\n\n- South: (4,2) - kitchen counter, not walkable\n\n- East: (5,3) - not listed, so empty tile\n\n- West: (3,3) - not listed, so empty tile\n\nSo he can move west to (3,3) or east to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) is at (3,3), which is adjacent to (3,2) south, but (3,2) has no item now.\n\nTo go to (4,1) for pot (4,0), he needs to get to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is empty, but how to get there from (4,3)?\n\nSince (4,2) is blocked, he cannot go directly south.\n\nHe can go to (3,3) then south to (3,2)? But (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nHe can go to (5,3) then south to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nThen to (5,1) or something.\n\nLet's list the grid for clarity.\n\nAssume x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4.\n\ny=0: tiles: (0,0) K, (1,0) K, (2,0) K, (3,0) P, (4,0) P, (5,0) K, (6,0) K (has onion), (7,0) K\n\ny=1: (0,1) K, (1,1) ? not listed, empty? (2,1)? (3,1) empty (Alice), (4,1) empty, (5,1)? (6,1)? (7,1) K\n\nOnly (0,1) and (7,1) listed as K, so (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1) are empty? (3,1) is Alice position, empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) not listed, so empty.\n\ny=2: (0,2) Plate dispenser, (1,2)? not listed, empty? (2,2) K (has onion), (3,2) K (had onion, now empty?), (4,2) K (empty), (5,2) K (has onion), (6,2)? (7,2) Serving counter\n\nListed: (0,2) plate dispenser, (2,2) K, (3,2) K, (4,2) K, (5,2) K, (7,2) serving. So (1,2), (6,2) not listed, so empty tiles.\n\ny=3: (0,3) K, (1,3)? (2,3)? (3,3)? (4,3) Bob, (5,3)? (6,3)? (7,3) K\n\nOnly (0,3) and (7,3) listed as K, so (1,3) to (6,3) empty except Bob at (4,3).\n\ny=4: (0,4) K, (1,4) K, (2,4) K, (3,4) Onion disp, (4,4) Onion disp, (5,4) K (has onion), (6,4) K, (7,4) K\n\nSo empty tiles are those not specified as non-empty types.\n\nBack to Bob at (4,3). He can move to (3,3) west or (5,3) east.\n\n(4,1) is below, but (4,2) is blocked.\n\nTo reach (4,1), he can go to (3,3) or (5,3), then down to y=2, but y=2 at x=3 or x=5.\n\n(3,2) is K, not walkable, (5,2) is K, not walkable.\n\nThen to (3,1) or (5,1), etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), move west to (3,3), which is empty.\n\nThen from (3,3), he can move south to (3,2)? But (3,2) is kitchen counter, cannot walk, so only adjacent moves to empty tiles.\n\nFrom (3,3), adjacent: north (3,4) onion disp, not empty; south (3,2) K, not empty; east (4,3) occupied by Bob? No, he moved, so after move, (4,3) empty.\n\nWhen he moves, he leaves the tile.\n\nAt turn 55, Bob is at (4,3). I am planning Alice's actions, but Bob will also act; the problem is to plan for Alice, and optionally for Bob, but since Bob is controlled by another player, I think I need to assume Bob's actions or coordinate.\n\nThe task is to plan actions for Alice, and I can suggest or assume Bob's actions for coordination.\n\nTo maximize, I should consider both.\n\nThe answer format is for Alice, but I can include Bob if needed, but it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can plan for both.\n\nTo be precise, let's see the output format: it says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\", and in answer, it's for Alice.\n\nBut to coordinate, I might need to specify what Bob should do.\n\nPerhaps I should output only Alice's actions, and assume Bob will act rationally.\n\nBut Bob might not follow, so I should plan based on current state and predict.\n\nSince we collaborate, I can assume they work together.\n\nI think for this, I'll plan Alice's actions and suggest Bob's actions in text.\n\nBut the output should be only actions for Alice in the boxed format.\n\nLet's read: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice\" — it says for Alice.\n\nAnd in answer format, only turns with actions for Alice.\n\nBut it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the format, it's not specified for Bob.\n\nLook: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\nBut in the answer format, it only shows \"Turn t: a_t\" without specifying player, but since it's for Alice, I think it's Alice's actions.\n\nThe example has \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" etc, no player, so probably for Alice.\n\nI should output only Alice's actions.\n\nThen for Bob, I need to assume he will act to help, or based on history.\n\nBob's action history: R, L, U, I, R. Recent: I, R, so he interacted and moved right.\n\nHe is holding onion, so he probably wants to add it to a pot.\n\nSince he is at (4,3), and pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), he can go to (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nHow to get to (4,1) from (4,3)?\n\nHe can go east to (5,3), then south to (5,2)? But (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can go to (5,3) then to (5,2) is not possible, must go to empty tile.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent empty tiles: north (5,4) K with onion, not walkable; south (5,2) K, not walkable; east (6,3) empty; west (4,3) empty but he came from there.\n\n(6,3) is empty.\n\nThen from (6,3), he can go south to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, so empty? y=2, (6,2) not in list, so empty tile.\n\nThen from (6,2) to (6,1), empty, then to (6,0) but (6,0) is K with onion, not walkable, but (6,1) is empty.\n\n(6,1) to (5,1) or (7,1), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), it's complicated.\n\nFrom (4,3) go west to (3,3), then from (3,3) he can go south? No, (3,2) blocked.\n\nFrom (3,3) he can go east to (4,3) or west to (2,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) is empty? Not listed, so yes.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (2,2)? (2,2) K with onion, not walkable.\n\nSo the only way to lower y is to go to x where y=2 is empty, like (1,2) or (6,2).\n\n(1,2) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), if he goes west to (3,3), then west to (2,3), then west to (1,3)? (1,3) empty, then south to (1,2) empty.\n\nThen from (1,2) he can go east to (2,2) but not walkable, or south to (1,1) empty, etc.\n\nBut this is long to reach (4,1).\n\nSince (4,1) is at (4,1), and (4,2) is blocked, he can go to (3,1) or (5,1), then to (4,1) if possible.\n\n(3,1) is where Alice is, and (5,1) is empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), go east to (5,3), then south to (5,2) not possible, so go to (6,3) first? From (4,3) to (5,3), then to (6,3) if he wants, but better to go to (5,3) then to (5,4) not possible, so to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (6,1), then to (5,1) or (7,1), etc.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) is possible, (5,1) empty.\n\nThen from (5,1) to (4,1) east? (4,1) is at (4,1), (5,1) at (5,1), so adjacent east-west.\n\n(5,1) to (4,1) is west, since x-1.\n\nSo he can go to (5,1) then west to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (6,1), then to (5,1), then to (4,1). That's 5 moves, plus orientation change.\n\nBut he needs to be facing down to interact with pot.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nThere is a shorter way. From (4,3) go west to (3,3), then to (3,2) not possible, but (3,1) is below, but (3,2) blocked, so he can't go directly to (3,1) from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,4) not possible, so only to (2,3) or (4,3).\n\nSo to reach (4,1), it takes multiple turns.\n\nHe can add to pot (3,0) from (3,1) if Alice moves.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), she can move after adding her onion.\n\nLet's sequence the turns.\n\nStart from turn 55.\n\nTurn 55: Alice action.\n\nAlice at (3,1) face L.\n\nAction: U to face up to prepare for picking up from (3,2).\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nThen turn 56: I to pick up onion from (3,2). Now Alice holding onion, (3,2) empty.\n\nTurn 57: D to face down to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nTurn 58: I to add onion to pot (3,0). Now pot (3,0) has 1 onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1) face down.\n\nNow she can move away to let Bob add his onion.\n\nBob is at (4,3) holding onion.\n\nHe can come to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nBut from (4,3) to (3,1), he needs to go to (3,3) or something.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,3) west, then to (3,2) not possible, but (3,1) is south of (3,2), but he can go to (3,3) then south? No.\n\nHe can go to (4,2) not possible.\n\nThe only access to (3,1) is from (3,0) not walkable, or (2,1), (4,1), (3,2) not, so adjacent are (2,1), (4,1), (3,0) not, (3,2) not, so (3,1) has adjacent: north (3,2) K, not empty; south (3,0) P, not empty; east (4,1) empty; west (2,1) empty.\n\nSo to reach (3,1), one must be at (2,1) or (4,1) or (3,0) not, so from (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(2,1) is empty, (4,1) empty.\n\nBob at (4,3) can go to (4,1) via the long way, or to (3,1) from (4,1) or (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is far.\n\nSince Alice is at (3,1), she can move to (4,1) or (2,1) to free (3,1) for Bob.\n\nThen Bob can come to (3,1) to add onion.\n\nBut Bob needs to be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nFirst, Alice can move to (4,1) for example.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (4,1) is east, so move right.\n\nTurn 59: Alice move R to (4,1), face east? When moving, position and orientation change.\n\nPlayer actions: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation to that direction.\n\nChange Orientation (L/R/U/D) changes orientation but not position if adjacent tile not empty, but for orientation change, it doesn't depend on adjacent, I think.\n\nFrom rules: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" Let's read.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That seems odd.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut change orientation shouldn't involve moving.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or misphrasing.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. It says \"No move if...\" so for change orientation, it only changes orientation if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? That doesn't make sense for orientation change.\n\nPerhaps it's that for change orientation, it doesn't change position, but the condition is for when you try to move but can't.\n\nLet's read the full action description.\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n- Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\n- Stay (S): Do nothing.\"\n\nFor \"Change Orientation\", it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is ambiguous.\n\nI think it might mean that when you choose to change orientation, you don't move, and the \"no move if\" might be a mistake or for move action.\n\nPerhaps for Change Orientation, it always changes orientation without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles.\n\nBut the text says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which suggests that if you choose to change orientation to a direction, and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, you don't move, but since it's orientation change, moving doesn't apply.\n\nThis is messy. I think it might be a wording error.\n\nPerhaps \"Change Orientation\" is intended to be like turning without moving, and the \"no move\" part is redundant or for move action.\n\nTo simplify, I think for planning, we can assume that Change Orientation action always changes the player's orientation to the specified direction, without changing position, and it doesn't depend on adjacent tiles.\n\nSimilarly, for Move, it changes position and orientation only if the target tile is empty and walkable.\n\nFor Move: it changes position and orientation to the direction, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable.\n\nFor Change Orientation: it changes orientation to the direction, without moving, and it should be possible regardless.\n\nThe text says for Change Orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which might mean that if you try to change orientation to a direction where the adjacent tile is not empty, it doesn't do anything? But that seems strange for orientation change.\n\nI think it's better to assume that Change Orientation always succeeds in changing orientation.\n\nFor example, in Alice's action history, she has L, R, D, L, which are likely orientation changes or moves, but it doesn't specify.\n\nHer history: I, L, R, D, L — actions, so L could be move or orientation change.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that for orientation change, it always works.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAfter turn 58, Alice at (3,1) face down, just added onion to pot (3,0).\n\nPot has 1 onion.\n\nTurn 59: Alice can move to (4,1) by moving right (R), so she moves to (4,1) facing right.\n\nNow (3,1) is empty.\n\nBob at (4,3) can move to (3,3) then to (3,2) not possible, but to reach (3,1), he can go to (2,1) or (4,1), but (4,1) is now occupied by Alice.\n\nAlice is at (4,1).\n\n(3,1) is empty now.\n\nBob can go to (3,3) then to (2,3) or directly, but from (4,3) to (3,3) west.\n\nTurn 59: Bob can move west to (3,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (3,3), he can move south? Not possible, so he can move to (2,3) west or (4,3) east or (3,4) north not empty.\n\n(2,3) is empty.\n\nTurn 60: Bob move west to (2,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (2,3), he can move south to (2,2)? But (2,2) K with onion, not walkable, so he can move to (2,4) not, or (1,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,1), he needs to go to (2,1) or (4,1), but (4,1) has Alice.\n\n(2,1) is empty.\n\nFrom (2,3), move south not possible, so move west to (1,3), then south to (1,2), then east to (2,2) not possible, so south to (1,1), then east to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nThis is too long.\n\nSince (3,1) is empty, and he is at (3,3), he can't go directly down because (3,2) blocked.\n\nThere is no direct path vertically at x=3 because (3,2) is counter.\n\nSimilarly at x=4, (4,2) is counter.\n\nSo the only way to (3,1) is from (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is empty.\n\nFrom Bob's position, he can go to (2,1) via (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,2) not, to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) etc.\n\nBut let's count turns.\n\nBob at (4,3) turn 55.\n\nTurn 55: Bob can move west to (3,3) facing west.\n\nTurn 56: from (3,3) move west to (2,3) facing west.\n\nTurn 57: from (2,3) move south not possible, so move west to (1,3) facing west.\n\nTurn 58: from (1,3) move south to (1,2) facing south.\n\n(1,2) is empty.\n\nTurn 59: from (1,2) move south to (1,1) facing south.\n\nTurn 60: from (1,1) move east to (2,1) facing east.\n\nTurn 61: from (2,1) move east to (3,1) facing east.\n\nThen at (3,1), he needs to face down to interact with pot.\n\nTurn 62: change orientation to D.\n\nTurn 63: I to add onion to pot.\n\nBut this is many turns, and pot has only one onion so far.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can do other things.\n\nBut this is inefficient.\n\nBob can add to the other pot (4,0) from (4,1).\n\nAlice is at (4,1) after turn 59.\n\nPot (4,0) is south of (4,1).\n\nAlice at (4,1) can face down and interact to add to pot (4,0), but she is holding nothing after adding to (3,0), so she has nothing to add.\n\nAfter turn 58, Alice is holding nothing, at (3,1).\n\nTurn 59: she moved to (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can face down and interact with pot (4,0), but to add ingredient, she needs to hold something, which she doesn't, so she can't.\n\nShe can go get another onion.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), she can go to a counter with onion.\n\ne.g. (5,2) has onion, at (5,2).\n\nShe is at (4,1), face east? After move R to (4,1), facing right (east).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is south-east.\n\nTo interact with (5,2), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (5,2): north (5,3), south (5,1), east (6,2), west (4,2).\n\n(5,3) empty, (5,1) empty, (6,2) empty, (4,2) K, not empty.\n\nSo she can be at (5,1) south, (5,3) north, or (6,2) east.\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move south to (4,0)? (4,0) pot, not walkable.\n\nMove east to (5,1)? (5,1) is empty.\n\nTurn 59: Alice move R to (4,1) facing east? Move R from (3,1) to (4,1), so position (4,1), orientation east.\n\nThen she can move south to (4,0) not possible, so move east to (5,1) empty.\n\nTurn 60: move R to (5,1), facing east.\n\nNow at (5,1), she is south of (5,2) K with onion.\n\nTo interact, she needs to face north (up).\n\nCurrent orientation east, so change to U.\n\nTurn 61: U to face up.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion from (5,2).\n\nTurn 62: I to pick up, now holding onion.\n\nThen she can add to a pot.\n\nFor example, to pot (4,0), she is at (5,1), pot (4,0) is west and south? (4,0) is at (4,0), adjacent tiles: north (4,1), south invalid, east (5,0) K, not empty, west (3,0) P.\n\nSo only (4,1) is adjacent empty tile.\n\nShe needs to be at (4,1) facing south to interact.\n\nFrom (5,1), she can move west to (4,1), but (4,1) might be occupied.\n\nAt turn 62, (4,1) is empty, I think.\n\nBob is elsewhere.\n\nLet's assume Bob is moving to add his onion.\n\nTo save time, let's use the pot at (4,0) for Bob.\n\nBob at (4,3) can go to (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nFrom (4,3), he can go to (5,3) east.\n\nTurn 55: Bob move R to (5,3) facing east.\n\nThen to (6,3) east.\n\nTurn 56: move R to (6,3) facing east.\n\nThen to (6,2) south.\n\n(6,2) empty.\n\nTurn 57: move D to (6,2) facing south.\n\nThen to (6,1) south.\n\nTurn 58: move D to (6,1) facing south.\n\nThen to (5,1) west, but (5,1) might be occupied.\n\n(5,1) is empty at turn 58.\n\nTurn 59: move L to (5,1) facing west.\n\nThen to (4,1) west.\n\nTurn 60: move L to (4,1) facing west.\n\nNow at (4,1), he can face down to interact with pot (4,0).\n\nTurn 61: D to face down.\n\nTurn 62: I to add onion to pot (4,0).\n\nNow pot (4,0) has one onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can add to pot (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nFirst, for Alice, at turn 55-58: she added one onion to pot (3,0).\n\nThen turn 59: move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 60: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 61: U to face up\n\nTurn 62: I to pick up onion from (5,2)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nShe can add to pot (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nPot (3,0) has one onion, pot (4,0) has one onion from Bob.\n\nSay she goes to pot (3,0).\n\nShe at (5,1), pot (3,0) is at (3,0), adjacent (3,1).\n\nShe needs to be at (3,1).\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1) west, but (4,1) might be occupied by Bob.\n\nAt turn 62, Bob is at (4,1) adding onion, so (4,1) occupied.\n\nAfter turn 62, Bob added, so he might move.\n\nBut let's not assume Bob's actions for now.\n\nPerhaps Alice can add to pot (4,0) from (4,1), but (4,1) has Bob.\n\nConflict.\n\nAlice can go to (3,1) to add to pot (3,0).\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1) west, but occupied, so go to (5,2) not possible, or to (6,1) east, then to (6,0) not, etc.\n\nTo (4,1) is direct but may be occupied.\n\nFrom (5,1) move west to (4,1) if empty.\n\nAt turn 62, after Alice picks up, (4,1) might be free if Bob moved.\n\nBob at (4,1) after adding at turn 62, he can move away.\n\nBut I am planning Alice's actions, so I need to sequence only Alice.\n\nSince we collaborate, I can assume Bob will move after adding.\n\nBut to be safe, let's choose a different counter.\n\nThere are other onions.\n\nFor example, (2,2) has onion, or (5,4), etc.\n\nAlice at (5,1) after turn 62, holding onion.\n\nInstead of adding to pot, she can go to (3,1) to add to pot (3,0).\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1), but (4,1) may be blocked.\n\nMove west to (4,1), if empty, turn 63: move L to (4,1), facing west.\n\nThen to (3,1) west, turn 64: move L to (3,1), facing west.\n\nThen face down to interact with pot (3,0), turn 65: D to face down.\n\nTurn 66: I to add onion.\n\nNow pot (3,0) has 2 onions.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can add another onion.\n\nBut this is slow.\n\nTo save time, we can use the onions on counters directly.\n\nAnother idea: since there are many onions on counters, Alice and Bob can each add to the same pot.\n\nBut only one can be at (3,1) at a time.\n\nSo they need to coordinate.\n\nLet's start the pot with 3 onions quickly.\n\nAlice at turn 55: U to face up (for (3,2))\n\nTurn 56: I to pick up onion from (3,2)\n\nTurn 57: D to face down (for pot (3,0))\n\nTurn 58: I to add onion to pot (3,0)  -- 1 onion\n\nNow Alice at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nTurn 59: move R to (4,1) facing right\n\nNow she can go to another counter, e.g. (2,2) has onion.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), adjacent empty tiles: south (2,1), north (2,3), east (3,2) K, west (1,2) empty.\n\n(2,1) empty, (2,3) empty.\n\nAlice at (4,1), face east.\n\nShe can move west to (3,1)? (3,1) is empty, but she can move to (3,1) west.\n\nTurn 60: move L to (3,1) facing west? Move L from (4,1) to (3,1), so position (3,1), orientation west.\n\nThen from (3,1), she can move west to (2,1) if empty.\n\n(2,1) empty.\n\nTurn 61: move L to (2,1) facing west.\n\nNow at (2,1), she is south of (2,2) K with onion.\n\nTo interact, need to face north (up).\n\nCurrent orientation west, so change to U.\n\nTurn 62: U to face up.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nTurn 63: I to pick up, now holding onion.\n\nThen she can add to pot (3,0) at (3,1).\n\nBut she is at (2,1), so move east to (3,1).\n\nTurn 64: move R to (3,1) facing east.\n\nThen face down to interact with pot.\n\nTurn 65: D to face down.\n\nTurn 66: I to add onion. Now pot (3,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs another onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can add his onion.\n\nBut let's get the third onion.\n\nAlice can go to another counter.\n\nBut time is passing.\n\nBob has an onion, he can add it.\n\nAssume at turn 55, Bob moves towards (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nSay Bob at turn 55 move W to (3,3) facing west.\n\nTurn 56 move W to (2,3) facing west.\n\nTurn 57 move W to (1,3) facing west.\n\nTurn 58 move S to (1,2) facing south.\n\nTurn 59 move S to (1,1) facing south.\n\nTurn 60 move E to (2,1) facing east.\n\nTurn 61 move E to (3,1) facing east.\n\nBut at turn 61, Alice is at (2,1), so (3,1) is empty? Turn 61 Alice is at (2,1) after moving.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 55:\nAlice: U (face up)\nBob: move W to (3,3)\n\nTurn 56:\nAlice: I (pick up from (3,2))\nBob: move W to (2,3)\n\nTurn 57:\nAlice: D (face down)\nBob: move W to (1,3)\n\nTurn 58:\nAlice: I (add to pot (3,0), now 1 onion)\nBob: move S to (1,2)\n\nTurn 59:\nAlice: move R to (4,1)  -- now at (4,1) face east\nBob: move S to (1,1)  -- at (1,1) face south\n\nTurn 60:\nAlice: move L to (3,1)  -- from (4,1) move west to (3,1), face west\nBob: move E to (2,1)  -- from (1,1) move east to (2,1), face east\n\nAt turn 60, Alice moves to (3,1), but Bob moves to (2,1), so (2,1) is occupied by Bob, so Alice can't move to (2,1) if Bob is there.\n\nAt turn 60, Alice is at (4,1) moving to (3,1), and Bob at (1,1) moving to (2,1), so both actions happen, positions updated, so (3,1) and (2,1) are occupied.\n\nTurn 61:\nAlice: move L to (2,1)? But (2,1) has Bob, so she cannot move there; the move would fail if not empty, so she must choose a different action.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nTo avoid conflict, let's use both pots.\n\nStart pot at (4,0) with Bob's onion.\n\nBob at (4,3) holding onion, he can go to (4,1) to add.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nTurn 55 Bob move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 56 move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 57 move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 58 move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 59 move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 60 move L to (4,1)  -- at (4,1) face west\n\nTurn 61 D to face down\n\nTurn 62 I to add onion to pot (4,0)  -- pot (4,0) has 1 onion\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can work on pot (3,0).\n\nAlice at turn 55 U\n\n56 I pick up onion from (3,2)\n\n57 D face down\n\n58 I add to pot (3,0)  -- 1 onion\n\n59 move R to (4,1) but at turn 59, (4,1) is empty, but Bob is at (6,1) or something, turn 59 Bob at (6,1), so (4,1) empty, Alice move R to (4,1) face east\n\nThen at turn 60, Alice at (4,1), face east, holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to get another onion for pot (3,0).\n\nFor example, to (5,2) or other.\n\nAt (4,1), she can move east to (5,1) turn 60 move R to (5,1) face east\n\nThen at (5,1), face east, she can face up to interact with (5,2) north.\n\nTurn 61 U to face up\n\nTurn 62 I to pick up onion from (5,2) now holding onion\n\nThen she can go to (3,1) to add to pot (3,0).\n\nFrom (5,1) move west to (4,1) turn 63 move L to (4,1) face west\n\nThen to (3,1) west turn 64 move L to (3,1) face west\n\nThen face down turn 65 D\n\nTurn 66 I add to pot (3,0) now 2 onions\n\nFor the third onion, she or Bob can add.\n\nBob after adding at turn 62, he can go get another onion.\n\nFor example, to (5,4) or other.\n\nBut let's focus on Alice.\n\nAfter pot has 3 onions, it cooks for 5 turns, then need to serve with plate.\n\nSo for now, let's get the pot to 3 onions quickly.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, Alice can grab one and add, but it takes time.\n\nAnother way: Alice at (3,1) after adding first onion, instead of moving to (4,1), she can stay and Bob adds to the other pot.\n\nBut both pots can be used.\n\nPot (3,0) has 1 onion, need two more.\n\nAlice can add another one.\n\nBut she needs to get onion first.\n\nThere is onion at (6,0) on counter, but (6,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, adjacent empty tile.\n\n(6,0) has adjacent: north (6,1), east (7,0) K, west (5,0) K, south invalid.\n\nSo only (6,1) is adjacent.\n\n(6,1) is empty.\n\nAlice at (4,1) or wherever.\n\nTo save turns, let's have Alice and Bob each add to a different pot.\n\nFor example, Alice works on pot (3,0), Bob on pot (4,0).\n\nBob at (4,3) with onion, he can add to pot (4,0) as above.\n\nAlice with no onion, she can get another for pot (3,0).\n\nAt turn 58, Alice at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nInstead of moving to (4,1), she can go directly to another counter, e.g. (5,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) move east to (4,1) turn 59 R to (4,1) face east\n\nThen to (5,1) turn 60 R to (5,1) face east\n\nThen U to face up turn 61\n\nI to pick up turn 62\n\nNow holding onion, then back to (3,1) move west to (4,1) turn 63 L to (4,1) face west\n\nThen to (3,1) turn 64 L to (3,1) face west\n\nD to face down turn 65\n\nI to add turn 66\n\nPot (3,0) now has 2 onions (first at turn 58, second at turn 66, so 8 turns apart, but the pot is cooking only when 3 onions, so it's not cooking yet.\n\nAfter first onion, the pot is not cooking because it needs 3.\n\nCooking starts only when 3 ingredients are added.\n\nSo pot (3,0) has 1 onion since turn 58.\n\nAt turn 66, second onion added, so still not cooking.\n\nThen need third onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can add his at turn 62 to pot (4,0), so one onion there.\n\nThen he can get another for pot (4,0) or for (3,0).\n\nTo maximize, let's fill one pot first.\n\nAlice and Bob both add to pot (3,0).\n\nAlice adds first at turn 58.\n\nThen she moves away, e.g. to (4,1) turn 59 R\n\nThen Bob comes to (3,1) to add his onion.\n\nBob at turn 55 move W to (3,3)\n\n56 W to (2,3)\n\n57 W to (1,3)\n\n58 S to (1,2)\n\n59 S to (1,1)\n\n60 E to (2,1)\n\n61 E to (3,1)  -- at (3,1) face east\n\n62 D to face down\n\n63 I to add onion to pot (3,0) now 2 onions\n\nThen Alice can add the third.\n\nAlice at (4,1) holding nothing, she can go to get an onion, e.g. from (5,2).\n\nTurn 60: at (4,1) face east, move R to (5,1) turn 60\n\nTurn 61 U to face up\n\nTurn 62 I to pick up from (5,2)\n\nTurn 63 move L to (4,1) face west\n\nTurn 64 move L to (3,1) face west\n\nBut at turn 64, (3,1) might have Bob or not.\n\nAt turn 63, Bob added at (3,1), so he is there.\n\nAfter adding, he can move away.\n\nTurn 63 Bob I to add, so at (3,1), he can move at turn 64.\n\nTurn 64 Bob move away, e.g. to (4,1) or other.\n\nThen Alice can move to (3,1) turn 64\n\nThen turn 65 D face down\n\nTurn 66 I add third onion.\n\nNow pot (3,0) has 3 onions at turn 66, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so ready at turn 71.\n\nThen need to serve with plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nNeed to grab a plate and put it on the soup, then deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can do that.\n\nBut let's plan Alice's actions up to say turn 65 or so.\n\nFirst, for Alice, from turn 55 to 66 as above.\n\nBut H is not specified, so I need to choose H.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, and serving, plan for 10 turns from 55 to 65.\n\nTurn 55: U (face up for (3,2))\n\nTurn 56: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nTurn 57: D (face down for pot (3,0))\n\nTurn 58: I (add onion to pot (3,0))  -- pot has 1 onion\n\nTurn 59: R (move right to (4,1), face east)  -- to free (3,1) for Bob\n\nTurn 60: R (move right to (5,1), face east)  -- towards (5,2)\n\nTurn 61: U (face up for (5,2))\n\nTurn 62: I (pick up onion from (5,2))  -- now holding onion\n\nTurn 63: L (move left to (4,1), face west)\n\nThen turn 64: L (move left to (3,1), face west)  -- but (3,1) may be occupied by Bob\n\nIf Bob is adding at turn 63, he might be there.\n\nTo avoid, Alice can wait or do something else.\n\nAfter turn 62, she is at (5,1) holding onion, she can go directly to (3,1) via (4,1), but (4,1) might be occupied.\n\nAssume that after Bob adds at turn 63, he moves away at turn 64, so Alice can move to (3,1) at turn 64.\n\nTurn 64: L to (3,1) face west\n\nTurn 65: D (face down)\n\nTurn 66: I (add onion to pot (3,0))  -- now 3 onions, cooking starts\n\nBut for H=10, from turn 55 to 64 is 10 turns? Turn t1=55, actions for t=55 to t1+H-1, but H not specified.\n\nLet's say H=10, so actions for turn 55 to 64.\n\nTurn 55 to 64 is 10 actions.\n\nBut at turn 64, she is moving to (3,1), not adding yet.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 64: move to (3,1), then turn 65 and 66 to add, but turn 66 is beyond.\n\nFor H=10, actions from turn 55 to 64.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: I\nTurn 57: D\nTurn 58: I\nTurn 59: R\nTurn 60: R\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: I\nTurn 63: L\nTurn 64: L\n\nAt turn 64, she is at (3,1) holding onion, facing west.\n\nThen she can face down and interact on next turns, but not in the plan.\n\nCooking will start when third onion added.\n\nBob can add his onion earlier to the same pot.\n\nIn the above, at turn 63, Alice is at (4,1), then turn 64 to (3,1).\n\nIf Bob added at turn 63, he might be moving away.\n\nBut for the plan, we can output this.\n\nThen after, she can add the third onion.\n\nBut for the sequence, let's complete the soup.\n\nSince there is another onion on counter, e.g. (6,0), Alice or Bob can grab it for the third.\n\nBut let's finalize Alice's actions for 10 turns.\n\nSo from turn 55 to 64:\n\nTurn 55: U (face up)\nTurn 56: I (interact with (3,2) to pick up onion)\nTurn 57: D (face down)\nTurn 58: I (interact with pot (3,0) to add onion)\nTurn 59: R (move right to (4,1), face east)\nTurn 60: R (move right to (5,1), face east)\nTurn 61: U (face up)\nTurn 62: I (interact with (5,2) to pick up onion)\nTurn 63: L (move left to (4,1), face west)\nTurn 64: L (move left to (3,1), face west)\n\nAt turn 64, she is at (3,1) holding onion, facing west.\n\nThen on turn 65, she can D to face down, turn 66 I to add, but not in plan.\n\nFor the soup, after adding third onion, cooking starts, and after 5 turns, it is cooked.\n\nThen someone needs to grab a plate, put it on the soup to get the soup in plate, then deliver to serving counter.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nGrab plate from (0,2), then go to pot, interact with pot while holding plate to serve soup, then go to serving counter (7,2) to deliver.\n\nAlice or Bob can do that.\n\nBut for now, the plan is for Alice up to turn 64.\n\nPerhaps for H=10, it's not enough to complete, but we can start.\n\nTo maximize, since there are many onions, we can start cooking sooner.\n\nAlice at turn 55 can go directly to a counter with onion closer, but (3,2) is close.\n\nShe picked from (3,2) at turn 56.\n\nBob has an onion, he can add it to pot quickly if he can reach (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1) is not direct, but through (5,3) etc, 5 turns as before.\n\nMinimum turns to add for Bob is 6 turns to (4,1) or more to (3,1).\n\nSo with coordination, pot can have 3 onions by turn 66 or so.\n\nThen cooking to turn 71, then serving.\n\nFor the action plan, I'll output the sequence for Alice as above.\n\nThen the pot will have 2 onions from Alice and one from Bob, cooking starts at turn 66.\n\nBut in the plan, Alice has the second onion at turn 62, but adds at turn 66.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 62 she has onion, but moves to (3,1) at turn 64.\n\nShe can add to pot (4,0) if available.\n\nBut let's stick with the plan.\n\nSo for Alice, actions from turn 55 to 64:\n\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: I\nTurn 57: D\nTurn 58: I\nTurn 59: R\nTurn 60: R\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: I\nTurn 63: L\nTurn 64: L\n\nAt turn 64, she is at (3,1) holding onion, ready to add to pot (3,0) on next turn.\n\nFor the answer, I think this is fine.\n\nTo include the add, but H=10 ends at turn 64.\n\nPerhaps set H larger, but not specified.\n\nI think for the purpose, this sequence is ok.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to fill a pot with 3 onions as quickly as possible to start cooking the soup, which takes 5 turns. The pot at (3,0) is chosen due to Alice's proximity. Alice will add the first and third onions, while Bob adds the second onion. After cooking, the soup can be served for a reward of 20.\n\n### Coordination Plan:\n- **Alice's Role**: \n  - Pick up an onion from (3,2) at turn 56.\n  - Add it to pot (3,0) at turn 58.\n  - Move to (5,1) to pick up another onion from (5,2) at turn 62.\n  - Return to (3,1) and add the onion to the pot at turn 66 (beyond the 10-turn plan, but implied for completion).\n- **Bob's Role (assumed collaboration)**:\n  - Move to (3,1) by turn 63 (via path: (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1)).\n  - Add his held onion to pot (3,0) at turn 63.\n  - Move away afterward to free (3,1) for Alice.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence for Turns 55 to 64 (H=10):\n- Turn 55: U (face up to prepare for picking up onion from (3,2)).\n- Turn 56: I (pick up onion from kitchen counter at (3,2)).\n- Turn 57: D (face down to prepare for adding to pot (3,0)).\n- Turn 58: I (add onion to pot (3,0); pot now has 1 onion).\n- Turn 59: R (move right to (4,1), freeing (3,1) for Bob, and face east).\n- Turn 60: R (move right to (5,1), toward (5,2), and face east).\n- Turn 61: U (face up to prepare for picking up from (5,2)).\n- Turn 62: I (pick up onion from kitchen counter at (5,2)).\n- Turn 63: L (move left to (4,1), and face west).\n- Turn 64: L (move left to (3,1), and face west; ready to add onion on next turn).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By turn 63, Bob adds his onion (pot has 2 onions).\n- At turn 66, Alice adds the third onion (pot has 3 onions; cooking starts).\n- Cooking completes at turn 71.\n- Serving can then be done by grabbing a plate from (0,2), placing it on the soup, and delivering to (7,2) for a reward of 20.\n\nThis sequence optimizes Alice's actions to contribute to filling the pot while coordinating with Bob's expected actions. The total reward is maximized by starting the cooking process early, leveraging existing onions on counters to reduce trips to dispensers.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: I \\\\\nTurn 57: D \\\\\nTurn 58: I \\\\\nTurn 59: R \\\\\nTurn 60: R \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: I \\\\\nTurn 63: L \\\\\nTurn 64: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the game state and what we're trying to achieve. The goal is to maximize the reward from delivering soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1, which requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a reward of 20.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 59. I need to plan actions for Alice for the next several turns, say H turns. H isn't specified, but since cooking takes 5 turns, I should plan at least that far ahead. I'll assume H=10 for now to cover the cooking and serving process.\n\nLet me map out the game grid based on the tile types:\n\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nNo tomato dispensers, so we only have onions to work with for Recipe 1.\n\nNow, player positions:\n\n- Alice: at (3,1), facing Up (U), holding nothing.\n\n- Bob: at (3,3), facing Up (U), holding nothing.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters:\n\n- (5,2): onion\n\n- (5,4): onion\n\n- (6,0): onion\n\n- (2,2): onion\n\n- (3,2): onion\n\n- (4,2): onion\n\nAll pots are empty: (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nSince there are onions on counters, we might not need to go to dispensers immediately; we can use these onions to save time.\n\nTo make a soup, we need to put 3 onions into a pot. Once 3 are added, it cooks automatically in 5 turns. Then, someone needs to get a plate, serve the soup, and deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nPlates come from the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nServing counter is at (7,2).\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,1), which is above the pots at (3,0) and (4,0). Since she's facing U, she's not facing the pots; pots are below her at (3,0) and to the right at (4,0), but she's at (3,1), so (3,0) is directly below, and (4,0) is diagonally down-right.\n\nTo interact with a tile, she needs to be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right—not diagonally.\n\nSo for Alice at (3,1):\n\n- Down to (3,0) is a pot.\n\n- Right to (4,1) might be empty? I don't have a full grid map, but since it's not listed, it's probably an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3), facing U.\n\n(3,3) is a position; let's see what's around.\n\nFirst, I should list the empty tiles or infer the grid.\n\nThe grid isn't fully specified, but from the counters and dispensers, I can infer.\n\nFor example, positions like (3,1) and (3,3) aren't listed as counters, so they are probably empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1), (2,1), (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, so it's not empty.\n\nLet me sketch a small grid around the players.\n\nAssume the grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 4, based on the given positions.\n\ny=0 to 4, I think, since ( ,4) exists.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, for row y=0: counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), and pots at (3,0), (4,0). So (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, not counters.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: counters at (0,1), (7,1), so (1,1) to (6,1) might be empty except players or something, but players are at (3,1) and (3,3), so (3,1) is empty for Alice to stand.\n\ny=2: counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and plate dispenser at (0,2), serving counter at (7,2). So (1,2), (6,2) might be empty? Not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly y=3: counters at (0,3), (7,3), so (1,3) to (6,3) empty except Bob at (3,3)? Bob is at (3,3), which isn't listed as counter, so (3,3) is empty tile.\n\ny=4: counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), and onion dispensers at (3,4), (4,4).\n\nOnion dispensers are separate, but (3,4) and (4,4) are dispensers, not counters.\n\nNow, Alice at (3,1), facing U. Up from (3,1) is (3,2), but (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So if Alice is facing U, she is facing (3,2), which is adjacent and has an item.\n\nBut to interact, she needs to be on an empty tile adjacent and facing it. She is at (3,1), which is empty, and (3,2) is directly above, so if she faces U, she can interact with (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, she could face D to interact with (3,0), the pot below.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing U. Up from (3,3) is (3,4), which is an onion dispenser. So he can interact with it by facing U.\n\nNow, both are holding nothing.\n\nThere are onions on several kitchen counters: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). (3,2) is right above Alice.\n\n(3,2) has an onion, and Alice is at (3,1), facing U. So she could interact to pick up that onion immediately.\n\nAction history: for Alice, recent actions: L, D, I, U, U. Most recent is U, so she moved up? But she's at (3,1), and (3,2) is above, but (3,2) is a counter, not empty, so she couldn't move up to (3,2). Let's see the actions.\n\nAction history: L, D, I, U, U. The most recent is the last one, so sequence: first L, then D, then I, then U, then U.\n\nBut if she was at some position, moved L, D, I, U, U.\n\nSince she's at (3,1) now, and before that she moved U twice? But (3,2) is not empty, so she couldn't move to (3,2). Perhaps the U moves were possible if she was below.\n\nMaybe she was at (3,0) or something.\n\nSimilarly for Bob: R, D, I, L, U. Most recent U.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing U.\n\nI don't think I need the action history for planning, it's just context.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nTo maximize reward, we need to make and serve soups as quickly as possible.\n\nWith two pots, we could potentially make two soups, but we need onions and plates.\n\nFirst, let's see available onions: there are onions on counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,4), (6,0). And (5,4) is a counter with onion? (5,4) is a kitchen counter, yes.\n\nAlso, onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), but since there are onions on counters, we can use those.\n\nNow, pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nServing at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is close to (3,2) which has an onion, and to the pots below.\n\nBob is at (3,3), close to onion dispenser at (3,4) or counters like (5,4).\n\nSince Alice can pick up the onion at (3,2) immediately by interacting while facing up.\n\nShe is at (3,1), facing U, so if she does 'I', she should be able to pick up the onion from (3,2), since she's adjacent and facing it.\n\nSimilarly, Bob could go to (3,4) to get an onion or pick from counters.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, to fill a pot, we need 3 onions in it.\n\nPots are empty, so we can start with one.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, we should use those to save time going to dispensers.\n\nFor example, (3,2) has an onion, Alice can grab it.\n\nThen she can go down to (3,0) to put it in the pot.\n\nShe is at (3,1), so down to (3,0) is the pot.\n\nShe needs to face down to interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can grab another onion.\n\nBob is at (3,3), facing U. (3,4) is dispenser, but there might be closer onions.\n\nFor instance, (5,4) has an onion, but (5,4) is at y=4, x=5.\n\nBob at (3,3), so he can move to (4,3) or (2,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) to (5,4) is not adjacent; he needs to move.\n\nCounters with onions: (2,2) at (2,2), which is left and down from (3,3)? (3,3) to (2,2) is diagonal, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent positions: from (3,3), he can go L to (2,3), D to (3,2), R to (4,3), U to (3,4).\n\n(3,2) has an onion, but (3,2) is a counter, so he can't stand on it, but he can interact with it if adjacent and facing.\n\nIf Bob moves down to (3,2), but (3,2) is not empty, he can't move there. Players can only move to empty tiles.\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied by a counter, so Bob cannot move to (3,2). He can only interact from adjacent tiles.\n\nFrom (3,3), if he faces D, he can interact with (3,2) because it's directly below.\n\nSimilarly, if he faces U, he can interact with (3,4).\n\nNow, (3,2) has an onion, so Bob could pick it up by facing down and interacting.\n\nBut Alice is also near (3,2), so there might be conflict if both try to access the same counter.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is below (3,2), and she can interact with (3,2) by facing up.\n\nBob is at (3,3), above (3,2), and can interact by facing down.\n\nBut since (3,2) has only one onion, only one can pick it up.\n\nSimilarly, other counters have onions.\n\nTo avoid conflict, they should coordinate.\n\nPerhaps Alice can pick up the onion at (3,2) since she's closer or something.\n\nLet's list the onion locations:\n\n- (2,2): onion\n\n- (3,2): onion\n\n- (4,2): onion\n\n- (5,2): onion\n\n- (5,4): onion\n\n- (6,0): onion\n\nAlso, dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) can provide more onions if needed.\n\nFirst, we need to fill a pot.\n\nLet's assign tasks.\n\nFor example, Alice can handle the left pot at (3,0), Bob the right at (4,0), or something.\n\nBut onions are scattered.\n\nSince Alice is at (3,1), she can immediately interact with (3,2) to pick up the onion by doing 'I' while facing U. She is already facing U, so she can do 'I' now.\n\nThen, with the onion, she can move down to (3,0), but (3,0) is a pot, not empty, so she can't move to it, but she can interact with it from (3,1) by facing down.\n\nAfter picking up the onion, she is at (3,1), holding onion. Then she can change orientation to D and interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, Bob can get another onion and put it in the same pot or another.\n\nBut for one soup, we need three onions in one pot.\n\nSo for pot at (3,0), we need three onions.\n\nAlice can put one onion now if she picks from (3,2).\n\nThen we need two more.\n\nBob can get one from nearby, say from (4,2) or (2,2) or (5,2).\n\n(4,2) is adjacent to where? Bob is at (3,3).\n\nIf Bob moves to (4,3), which is probably empty, then he can face down to interact with (4,2), which has an onion.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), so from (4,3), facing D, he can pick it up.\n\nThen he can go to a pot to put it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) can be accessed from (2,3) or (2,1), etc.\n\nAlso, (5,2) from (5,3) or (5,1).\n\nBut let's plan step by step.\n\nFirst, at turn t_1=59, Alice can do 'I' to pick up onion from (3,2) since she is at (3,1), facing U, adjacent and facing the counter.\n\nThen, she will be holding an onion.\n\nNext, she needs to put it in a pot. The closest pot is (3,0) below her. She is at (3,1), so she can face down and interact to add to pot.\n\nSo for Alice: turn 59: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nThen turn 60: she needs to change orientation to D, then I to add to pot.\n\nCan she change orientation and interact in one turn? No, each turn one action.\n\nSo turn 59: I (pick up onion)\n\nNow she is holding onion, at (3,1), orientation U.\n\nTo interact with pot at (3,0), she needs to face down and then interact.\n\nSo turn 60: D (change orientation to down? But D can be move down or change orientation.\n\nAction set: Move (L/R/U/D) or Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) or Interact (I) or Stay (S).\n\nMove changes position and orientation, Change Orientation only changes orientation if not moving.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIf she does 'D' as move, she would move down to (3,0), but (3,0) is a pot, not empty, so she cannot move there. So she cannot move D to (3,0).\n\nTherefore, she must use Change Orientation to face down, then Interact.\n\nSo action: to change orientation down, she can do 'D' for change orientation? But the actions are not specified as separate; it says Move or Change Orientation.\n\nLet's read: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if she moves, it changes both.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nIt says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" I think it means that Change Orientation changes only orientation, without moving, but it doesn't depend on adjacent tile; it just changes orientation.\n\nThe phrasing is poor.\n\nFrom: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means that when you choose to change orientation, you don't move, and it changes orientation regardless, but the \"if\" part might be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps it's: for Move, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, you can't move, so you don't move but may change orientation? But it says Move changes position and orientation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nSo Move always changes position if possible. If the target tile is not empty or not walkable, you can't move, so you stay, but what about orientation? It doesn't say.\n\nThe constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if the tile is not empty, you cannot move there.\n\nFor Change Orientation: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. I think it might mean that Change Orientation only changes orientation and does not attempt to move, so it's safe.\n\nI believe for Change Orientation, it only changes the direction you're facing, without moving, and it doesn't depend on adjacent tiles.\n\nThe \"no move if\" might be a typo or misphrasing.\n\nSimilarly, for Move, if you try to move to a non-empty tile, you probably stay in place and orientation may or may not change; the rules don't specify.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume that:\n\n- Move: if the target tile is empty, you move there and face that direction. If not, you don't move, and orientation doesn't change (since you didn't move).\n\n- Change Orientation: you change to face that direction without moving.\n\n- Interact: interact with the tile you're facing, if adjacent and conditions met.\n\nIn this case, for Alice at (3,1), to interact with pot at (3,0), which is down.\n\nShe can't move down because (3,0) not empty.\n\nSo she must change orientation to down, then interact.\n\nSimilarly for picking up from (3,2), she is facing U, so she can interact directly.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nTurn 59: Alice can do 'I' to pick up onion from (3,2). Since she is facing U and (3,2) is adjacent up.\n\nAfter this, she holds onion, position (3,1), orientation U.\n\nNow to add to pot at (3,0), she needs to face down.\n\nSo turn 60: she can change orientation to down. Action: Change Orientation D, so she faces down.\n\nThen turn 61: she can do 'I' to interact with (3,0) and add the onion to the pot.\n\nNow the pot at (3,0) has one onion.\n\nWe need two more onions for this pot.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can help.\n\nBob is at (3,3), facing U.\n\nHe can also get onions.\n\nFor example, he can pick up an onion from (3,2), but Alice just took it, so (3,2) is now empty? When you pick up an item from a counter, it becomes empty.\n\nAfter Alice picks up the onion at (3,2), that counter is now empty, no onion.\n\nSimilarly, other counters have onions.\n\nBob can go to (4,2) or (2,2), etc.\n\n(4,2) has an onion.\n\nBob at (3,3), he can move right to (4,3), which should be empty.\n\nThen from (4,3), he can face down to interact with (4,2), which has an onion.\n\nSo actions for Bob:\n\nTurn 59: he can do R to move right to (4,3), and since move changes orientation, he will face right? Move R changes position to (4,3) and orientation to R.\n\nBut to interact with (4,2), which is below, he needs to face down.\n\nFrom (4,3), (4,2) is directly below, so he needs to face down.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), he is at (4,3), facing R (since he moved right).\n\nThen he needs to change orientation to down.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion.\n\nSo turn 59: Bob moves R to (4,3), now at (4,3), facing R.\n\nTurn 60: he changes orientation to D (down).\n\nTurn 61: I to pick up onion from (4,2).\n\nNow he holds onion.\n\nThen he can put it in a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\n(4,0) is below (4,1), but (4,1) is probably empty.\n\nBob at (4,3), holding onion, he can go down to (4,2), but (4,2) is a counter, not empty, so he can't move there. He can move to (4,2) only if it were empty, but it's not, it's a counter.\n\nHe can move to (4,2) only if it is an empty tile, but it's a kitchen counter, which is not walkable, so he cannot move to (4,2).\n\nHe can only interact from adjacent tiles.\n\nTo put onion in pot, say (4,0).\n\nHe needs to be adjacent to (4,0), like at (4,1), and facing down.\n\nCurrently at (4,3), he can move down to (4,2)? No, (4,2) not empty.\n\nHe can move down to (4,2) only if it is empty, but it's not, so he cannot.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? The tile below (4,3) is (4,2), which is not empty, so he cannot move down.\n\nHe can move left to (3,3), right to (5,3), or up to (4,4), or down not possible.\n\n(4,4) is an onion dispenser, not empty, so he cannot move there.\n\n(5,3) might be empty.\n\n(3,3) is empty, but Alice is not there now.\n\nSo from (4,3), he can move to (5,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nTo reach a pot, he needs to go to a tile adjacent to a pot.\n\nFor example, to access (4,0), he can be at (4,1), (3,0) is pot, (5,0) is counter, not empty, (4,-1) invalid.\n\nSo only from (4,1) or (3,0) but (3,0) not walkable, so only from (4,1) facing down, or from (3,1) or (5,1) but (5,1) might not be adjacent directly.\n\n(4,0) has adjacent tiles: up (4,1), left (3,0) is pot, right (5,0) is counter, down invalid. So only from (4,1) facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (3,0), only from (3,1) facing down.\n\nSo Bob at (4,3), to put onion in (4,0), he needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nFirst, he needs to move to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? No, (4,2) not empty.\n\nHe can move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2)? (3,2) not empty.\n\n(3,2) is counter, not empty, so he can't move to (3,2).\n\nHe can move to (3,3) left, then from (3,3) he can move down? Down to (3,2) not possible.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down only if (3,2) empty, but it's not.\n\nHe can move to (2,3) or (4,3), but (4,3) he is at.\n\nPositions: from (4,3), he can move to (5,3) if empty, or to (3,3), or to (4,4) but (4,4) is dispenser, not empty, so no, or down not possible.\n\nSo only (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nAssume (5,3) is empty.\n\nHe can move to (5,3), then from there, he can move down to (5,2)? (5,2) is a kitchen counter with onion, not empty, so cannot move there.\n\nThen to (5,1) or something.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nBob can go to (4,1) via a different path.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), he can move down? Not directly.\n\nHe can move to (2,3), then to (2,2)? (2,2) not empty.\n\n(2,2) is counter, so he can't stand on it.\n\nThe empty tiles are between the counters.\n\nFor instance, at y=1, x from 1 to 6 except (0,1) and (7,1) are counters, so (1,1) to (6,1) are empty? (0,1) and (7,1) are counters, so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly, at y=3, (1,3) to (6,3) empty except players.\n\ny=2 has counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), so empty at (1,2), (6,2)? (1,2) not listed, so empty, (6,2) not listed, so empty.\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser, not empty, (7,2) serving counter, not empty.\n\nSo for Bob to reach (4,1), he can go from (3,3) to (3,2)? No, can't.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down to (3,2) only if it were empty, not.\n\nHe can move to (4,3) as before, then to (5,3), then down to (5,2)? No.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? No.\n\nHe can move to (3,3), then left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? No, (2,2) not empty.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move down to (2,2) only if empty, not.\n\nSo the only way to change y-level is at positions where there are empty tiles vertically.\n\nFor example, between x=1 and x=2 at y=1 and y=2, but (2,2) is counter, so no direct path.\n\nPerhaps at x=1 or x=6.\n\nFor instance, (1,2) might be empty, and (1,1) empty, so from (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) empty, (6,1) empty.\n\nOr (0,2) is dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3), he can move left to (2,3), which should be empty.\n\nThen from (2,3), he can move down to (2,2)? (2,2) not empty, so he can't.\n\nMove to (2,4)? (2,4) is counter, not empty.\n\nMove to (1,3) if available.\n\n(1,3) might be empty, since only (0,3) is counter.\n\nSo from (2,3), he can move left to (1,3), assuming it's empty.\n\nThen from (1,3), he can move down to (1,2), which is empty (not listed as counter).\n\nThen from (1,2), he can move down to (1,1), empty.\n\nThen from (1,1), he can move right to (2,1), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,1), it's a long way.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move right to (4,3), then to (5,3), then down to (5,2)? No, (5,2) not empty.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move down to (5,2) only if empty, not.\n\nMove to (5,4)? (5,4) is counter with onion, not empty.\n\nSo he can only move horizontally at y=3 or go to other rows via the sides.\n\nFor example, move to (6,3) if empty, then down to (6,2)? (6,2) is empty, since not listed, so he can move to (6,2) from (6,3) if (6,2) empty.\n\n(6,2) is not listed as counter, so it should be empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) empty.\n\nSo from Bob at (3,3), to reach (4,1):\n\n- Move right to (4,3) if not already\n\n- Then right to (5,3)  (assume empty)\n\n- Then down to (6,3)? (6,3) might not exist or empty; y=3, x from 0 to 7, (0,3) counter, (7,3) counter, so (6,3) should be empty.\n\nThen from (6,3) he can move down to (6,2), which is empty.\n\nThen from (6,2) he can move down to (6,1)? (6,1) is empty, since not (7,1) or (0,1), (6,1) should be empty.\n\n(6,1) is not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (6,1) he can move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut this is many moves.\n\nSince there are onions at (5,4), which is closer to him.\n\nBob at (3,3), he can move up to (3,4)? (3,4) is onion dispenser, not empty, so he can't move there.\n\nHe can face U and interact to get an onion from dispenser.\n\nOr he can go to (5,4) which has an onion on counter.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), Bob at (3,3), so he can move to (4,3), then to (5,3), then face up to interact with (5,4) if adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,3), (5,4) is above, so if he faces U, he can interact with (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is counter with onion, so he can pick it up.\n\nThen with onion, he can go to a pot.\n\nBut to (4,0) or (3,0).\n\nFrom (5,3), he can go to (5,2)? No, not empty.\n\nSo he needs to go to (6,2) or something, then down to (6,1), then to (5,1), etc to reach (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nPerhaps both players can work on the same pot to save time.\n\nFor example, Alice is already near pot (3,0).\n\nAfter Alice adds one onion to (3,0), the pot has one onion.\n\nThen we need two more onions for it.\n\nBob can get an onion and bring it.\n\nBut Bob is far.\n\nThere are onions on counters closer to the pots.\n\nFor example, (2,2) has onion, which is near (3,1).\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can move left to (2,1), which should be empty, then face up to interact with (2,2) to pick up onion.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) she can access.\n\nBut she is holding the first onion, let's sequence.\n\nAt turn 59, Alice does I to pick up from (3,2).\n\nThen she holds onion.\n\nThen she can add to pot at (3,0) as above.\n\nFor Bob, at turn 59, he can do something to get an onion quickly.\n\nFor example, at (3,3), he can change orientation to D to face down, then interact with (3,2), but (3,2) had an onion, but Alice just picked it, so it's empty now, so he can't pick anything.\n\nAt turn 59, Alice does I, so (3,2) becomes empty.\n\nSo Bob facing down at (3,3) would interact with (3,2), but it's empty, so nothing happens.\n\nHe can move to (4,3) and face down to (4,2), which has onion.\n\nSo turn 59: Bob moves R to (4,3), now at (4,3), facing R.\n\nTurn 60: he changes orientation to D (down).\n\nTurn 61: I to pick up onion from (4,2).\n\nNow he holds onion.\n\nThen he can go to (4,1) to put in pot (4,0) or (3,0).\n\n(4,1) is closer to him.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? Not possible.\n\nMove to (4,4)? Not empty.\n\nMove to (5,3), then to (6,3), down to (6,2), down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), to (4,1).\n\nMany moves.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move left to (3,3), then from (3,3) he can move down? No.\n\nOr to (3,2) not.\n\nSince (3,1) is occupied by Alice, he can't go there.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), so (3,1) is occupied.\n\nSo Bob cannot go to (3,1).\n\nHe can go to (4,1) via (4,2) not, so only via the sides.\n\nBut let's assume he can go to (6,1) in a few moves.\n\nTo save time, perhaps Alice can put the onion in the pot, then get another onion to add.\n\nAfter adding one onion, she is free to get more.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can get an onion and add.\n\nBut for the same pot.\n\nLet's plan for Alice first.\n\nTurn 59: Alice I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nTurn 60: Change orientation to D (face down)\n\nTurn 61: I (add onion to pot at (3,0))  now pot has 1 onion\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding nothing, facing down.\n\nNow she can get another onion.\n\nNearby, (2,2) has onion, or (4,2) has onion.\n\nShe can move left to (2,1), then face up to interact with (2,2).\n\nTurn 62: Alice move L to (2,1)  (assuming (2,1) empty), now at (2,1), facing left? Move L changes position to (2,1) and orientation to L.\n\nBut (2,2) is above, so she needs to face up.\n\nTurn 63: Change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 64: I to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can go back to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,1), now at (3,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 66: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 67: I to add to pot. Now pot has 2 onions.\n\nWe need one more.\n\nThen she can get another onion, say from (4,2) or elsewhere.\n\nBut (4,2) has onion.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move right to (4,1), then face up to interact with (4,2).\n\nTurn 68: move R to (4,1), at (4,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 69: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 70: I to pick up from (4,2)\n\nHold onion.\n\nThen add to pot at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nIf to (3,0), she needs to be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move left to (3,1), turn 71: move L to (3,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 72: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 73: I to add to pot. Now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns for this recipe.\n\nBut this is slow, and Bob is not helping.\n\nBob can do something in parallel.\n\nAlso, there is (6,0) with onion, but far.\n\nBob can work on the other pot or help this one.\n\nSince there is another pot at (4,0), Bob can start filling that one.\n\nBob at turn 59: move R to (4,3), at (4,3), facing R\n\nTurn 60: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 61: I to pick up onion from (4,2)  (4,2) has onion, so he picks it up, holding onion.\n\nThen he needs to put it in a pot, say (4,0).\n\nHe needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move to (4,1) via (4,2) not possible.\n\nMove to (5,3), then to (6,3), down to (6,2), down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), to (4,1).\n\nTurn 62: move R to (5,3), at (5,3), facing R\n\nTurn 63: move R to (6,3), at (6,3), facing R  (assume (6,3) empty)\n\nTurn 64: move D to (6,2), at (6,2), facing D\n\nTurn 65: move D to (6,1), at (6,1), facing D\n\nTurn 66: move L to (5,1), at (5,1), facing L\n\nTurn 67: move L to (4,1), at (4,1), facing L\n\nNow at (4,1), facing left, but to interact with pot at (4,0), he needs to face down.\n\nTurn 68: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 69: I to add onion to pot at (4,0)\n\nNow pot (4,0) has one onion.\n\nThen he can get more.\n\nBut this is even slower.\n\nBob can get an onion from (5,4) which is closer to his position.\n\nBob at (3,3) turn 59: move R to (4,3), at (4,3), facing R\n\nTurn 60: move U to (4,4)? (4,4) is onion dispenser, not empty, so cannot move there. He can interact with it if facing, but to interact, he needs to be adjacent and facing.\n\nFrom (4,3), (4,4) is above, so if he faces U, he can interact to get onion from dispenser.\n\nSince he is at (4,3), facing R after move, so turn 60: change orientation U to face up\n\nTurn 61: I to get onion from dispenser at (4,4)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen he can go to (4,1) to put in pot.\n\nFrom (4,3), to (4,1), but can't go directly.\n\nMove to (5,3), etc as before.\n\nSame issue.\n\nPerhaps the players can use the kitchen counters to store items or pass, but since they can carry only one, it might not help much.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can add the first onion to the pot, then get another onion and add, but as above.\n\nBob can get an onion and bring it to Alice or to the pot.\n\nBut with movement constraints.\n\nSince there is an onion at (6,0), which is near the pots, but (6,0) is a kitchen counter with onion, so to access, from (6,1) facing down.\n\n(6,1) is empty.\n\nAlice or Bob can pick it up.\n\nFor example, after Alice adds the first onion, she can go to (6,1) to pick up onion from (6,0).\n\nAlice at (3,1), after adding onion at turn 61, she is at (3,1), holding nothing, facing down.\n\nThen she can move right to (4,1), at (4,1), facing right.\n\nThen from (4,1), she can move down? (4,0) not empty, so she can face down to interact with (4,0) pot, but it's empty or has nothing.\n\nTo get to (6,1), from (4,1), move right to (5,1), then to (6,1).\n\nTurn 62: move R to (5,1), at (5,1), facing R\n\nTurn 63: move R to (6,1), at (6,1), facing R\n\nThen turn 64: change orientation D (down) to face (6,0)\n\nTurn 65: I to pick up onion from (6,0)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can add to pot at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nTo (3,0), from (6,1), move left to (5,1), to (4,1), to (3,1).\n\nTurn 66: move L to (5,1), facing L\n\nTurn 67: move L to (4,1), facing L\n\nTurn 68: move L to (3,1), facing L\n\nTurn 69: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 70: I to add to pot at (3,0)  now 2 onions.\n\nThen get a third.\n\nBut still slow.\n\nTo save time, Bob can add the second onion while Alice gets the third.\n\nBut Bob is far.\n\nLet's coordinate both.\n\nAt turn 59:\n\nAlice: I (pick up from (3,2))\n\nBob: since he can't do much immediately, he can start moving towards a source.\n\nFor example, Bob can move to a position to get an onion from (5,4) or something.\n\nBob at (3,3), turn 59: move R to (4,3), facing R\n\nTurn 60: move R to (5,3), facing R\n\nThen at (5,3), he can face U to interact with (5,4) which has onion.\n\nTurn 61: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 62: I to pick up onion from (5,4)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen he can go to (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nFrom (5,3), move D to (5,2)? No.\n\nMove to (6,3), D to (6,2), D to (6,1), L to (5,1), L to (4,1).\n\nTurn 63: move R to (6,3), facing R\n\nTurn 64: move D to (6,2), facing D\n\nTurn 65: move D to (6,1), facing D\n\nTurn 66: move L to (5,1), facing L\n\nTurn 67: move L to (4,1), facing L\n\nTurn 68: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 69: I to add to pot (4,0)\n\nNow pot (4,0) has one onion, but Alice is working on (3,0).\n\nFor (3,0), after Alice adds first onion at turn 61, she can get another onion quickly.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), she can move to (2,1) to get (2,2) onion.\n\nAs before, around turn 64 she adds second onion.\n\nThen she needs third.\n\nBob after adding to (4,0) at turn 69, he can get another onion for (3,0).\n\nBut (3,0) may be cooking by then if third added earlier.\n\nLet's estimate turns.\n\nFirst, for pot (3,0):\n\n- Turn 59: Alice I, pick up from (3,2)  (3,2) emptied\n\n- Turn 60: Alice change orientation D\n\n- Turn 61: Alice I, add to pot (3,0)  pot has 1 onion\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 62: Alice move L to (2,1), at (2,1), facing L\n\nTurn 63: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 64: I, pick up from (2,2)  (2,2) emptied\n\nHolding onion.\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,1), at (3,1), facing R\n\nTurn 66: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 67: I, add to pot (3,0)  pot has 2 onions\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n\nNow need third onion for (3,0).\n\nThere is (4,2) with onion or (5,2) etc.\n\nTurn 68: Alice move R to (4,1), at (4,1), facing R\n\nTurn 69: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 70: I, pick up from (4,2)  (4,2) emptied\n\nHolding onion.\n\nTurn 71: move L to (3,1), at (3,1), facing L\n\nTurn 72: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 73: I, add to pot (3,0)  now 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 73.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so ready at turn 78.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate and serve.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can go.\n\nBut let's see Bob.\n\nBob from turn 59:\n\nTurn 59: move R to (4,3), at (4,3), facing R\n\nTurn 60: move R to (5,3), at (5,3), facing R\n\nTurn 61: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 62: I, pick up from (5,4)  (5,4) emptied, holding onion\n\nThen to add to pot, say (4,0).\n\nTurn 63: move R to (6,3), at (6,3), facing R\n\nTurn 64: move D to (6,2), at (6,2), facing D\n\nTurn 65: move D to (6,1), at (6,1), facing D\n\nTurn 66: move L to (5,1), at (5,1), facing L\n\nTurn 67: move L to (4,1), at (4,1), facing L\n\nTurn 68: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 69: I, add to pot (4,0)  pot has 1 onion at turn 69.\n\nThen he can get more for this pot.\n\nBut at this point, Alice is adding the third onion to (3,0) at turn 73.\n\nBob can add to (4,0).\n\nFor example, turn 70: Bob from (4,1), holding nothing, facing down.\n\nHe can get another onion, say from (5,2) which has onion.\n\n(5,2) is above (5,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), he can move right to (5,1), turn 70: move R to (5,1), at (5,1), facing R\n\nTurn 71: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 72: I, pick up from (5,2)  (5,2) emptied\n\nHolding onion.\n\nTurn 73: move L to (4,1), at (4,1), facing L\n\nTurn 74: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 75: I, add to pot (4,0)  now 2 onions.\n\nWe need one more for (4,0).\n\nHe can get from elsewhere, say (6,0) or dispenser.\n\n(6,0) has onion.\n\nFrom (4,1), he can go to (6,1) to get it.\n\nTurn 76: move R to (5,1), facing R\n\nTurn 77: move R to (6,1), facing R\n\nTurn 78: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 79: I, pick up from (6,0)\n\nHolding onion.\n\nTurn 80: move L to (5,1), facing L\n\nTurn 81: move L to (4,1), facing L\n\nTurn 82: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 83: I, add to pot (4,0)  now 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 83.\n\nReady at turn 88.\n\nBut this is for the second pot.\n\nFirst pot at (3,0) ready at turn 78.\n\nSo for the first soup, we need to serve it.\n\nAfter adding the third onion at turn 73, cooking starts, ready in 5 turns, so at turn 78, soup is cooked.\n\nSomeone needs to get a plate and serve the soup.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can go.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) after adding the onion at turn 73.\n\nShe can go to get a plate.\n\nTo (0,2), she needs to move to (0,2), but (0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable, so she can interact from adjacent, like (0,1), (0,3), or (1,2).\n\n(0,1) is counter, not empty, (0,3) counter, (1,2) might be empty.\n\nSo from (1,2) facing left, or from (0,1) facing up, etc.\n\nEasier from (1,2).\n\nAlice at (3,1), turn 74: move L to (2,1), facing L\n\nTurn 75: move L to (1,1), facing L  (assume (1,1) empty)\n\nTurn 76: move U to (1,2), at (1,2), facing U  ( (1,2) empty)\n\nNow at (1,2), facing U, but plate dispenser at (0,2) is left, so she needs to face left.\n\nTurn 77: change orientation L (left)\n\nTurn 78: I to get plate from dispenser. Now holding clean plate.\n\nThen she needs to serve the soup at (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,2), to (3,1) to serve.\n\nTurn 79: move D to (1,1), facing D\n\nTurn 80: move R to (2,1), facing R\n\nTurn 81: move R to (3,1), at (3,1), facing R\n\nTurn 82: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 83: I to serve soup from pot (3,0) to plate. Now holding soup in plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1), to (7,2).\n\nMove right to (4,1), etc.\n\nTurn 84: move R to (4,1), facing R\n\nTurn 85: move U to (4,2)? (4,2) not empty, so can't.\n\nFrom (4,1), move U not possible.\n\nMove to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (6,2), then to (7,2)? (7,2) not empty.\n\nTo serve at (7,2), she needs to be adjacent, like at (7,1), (7,3), or (6,2).\n\n(7,1) is counter, not empty, (7,3) counter, (6,2) empty.\n\nSo from (6,2) facing right.\n\nAlice at (3,1), to (6,2).\n\nTurn 84: move R to (4,1), facing R\n\nTurn 85: move R to (5,1), facing R\n\nTurn 86: move R to (6,1), facing R\n\nTurn 87: move U to (6,2), at (6,2), facing U\n\nThen turn 88: change orientation R (right) to face (7,2)\n\nTurn 89: I to deliver soup. Reward obtained.\n\nBut the soup was ready at turn 78, and she serves at turn 89, so some delay, but since no one else, it's ok.\n\nCooking starts at turn 73, ready at turn 78, and she serves at turn 89, which is after, but as long as served, it's fine, no expiration mentioned.\n\nSimilarly, for the second pot, cooking starts at turn 83, ready at turn 88, Bob can serve or Alice.\n\nBut Alice is busy.\n\nBob can serve the second one.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,1) after adding onion at turn 83.\n\nHe can go to get plate.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor now, focus on Alice's actions for H turns.\n\nH is not specified, but since cooking takes 5 turns, and serving, say H=10 from t_1=59, so up to turn 69.\n\nBut at turn 59, we start.\n\nPerhaps we can optimize better.\n\nAnother idea: since there are many onions on counters, Alice can pick up an onion and place it on a counter near the pot for faster access, but it might not save time.\n\nOr Bob can pick multiple onions but can't, only one at a time.\n\nPerhaps Alice can add the first onion, then Bob brings one directly.\n\nBut Bob is slow.\n\nLet's assume that for the first pot, Alice can add all three onions quickly using the nearby counters.\n\nFor example, after adding the first at turn 61, she is at (3,1), facing down.\n\nInstead of going to (2,2), she can use (4,2) which is closer.\n\nFrom (3,1), move right to (4,1), turn 62: move R to (4,1), facing R\n\nTurn 63: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 64: I, pick up from (4,2)  holding onion\n\nTurn 65: move L to (3,1), at (3,1), facing L\n\nTurn 66: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 67: I, add to pot  now 2 onions\n\nThen she can get the third from (5,2) or (2,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), from (3,1), move to (5,1) then face up.\n\nTurn 68: move R to (4,1), facing R\n\nTurn 69: move R to (5,1), facing R\n\nTurn 70: change orientation U (up)\n\nTurn 71: I, pick up from (5,2)\n\nHolding onion.\n\nTurn 72: move L to (4,1), facing L\n\nTurn 73: move L to (3,1), facing L\n\nTurn 74: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 75: I, add to pot  now 3 onions at turn 75, cooking starts.\n\nSlightly better, turn 75 vs 73.\n\nTurn 73 was earlier, but with (2,2) it was turn 73 for 3 onions, with (4,2) it's turn 67 for 2 onions, then to (5,2) at turn 71 pick up, turn 75 add, so turn 75 for 3 onions.\n\nWorse than using (2,2).\n\nWith (2,2): added second at turn 67, then to (4,2) at turn 70 pick up, turn 74 add, but in my first sequence, with (2,2) second at turn 67, then to (4,2) turn 70 pick up, turn 74 add, so turn 74 for 3 onions.\n\nIn first sequence: add first at 61, second at 67, third at 74.\n\nCooking starts at 74.\n\nThen ready at 79.\n\nFor H=10, from t_1=59 to 69, we can have Alice add two onions to the pot by turn 67.\n\nThen the third can be added later.\n\nBut for the plan, we need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, Bob can add the third.\n\nBut let's define Alice's actions for the next few turns.\n\nAt turn 59, Alice should do I to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nThen turn 60: change orientation to D (down)\n\nTurn 61: I to add to pot (3,0)\n\nThen turn 62: move L to (2,1)  (assume empty)\n\nTurn 63: change orientation U (up) to face (2,2)\n\nTurn 64: I to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,1)  (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 66: change orientation D (down)\n\nTurn 67: I to add to pot (3,0)  now 2 onions\n\nThen for turn 68, she can move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 69: change orientation U (up) to face (4,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for H=10, up to turn 69, she has added two onions and is at (4,1) facing up, ready to pick up from (4,2) on turn 70.\n\nBut since we need to specify actions for Alice, and optionally Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice, and Bob can be coordinated.\n\nThe task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can plan for Alice only, or both.\n\nTo maximize, we should coordinate.\n\nBut in the answer format, it's for Alice.\n\nLet's see the answer format: only Alice's actions.\n\nSo I need to output Alice's actions for the next H turns.\n\nH is not specified, so I'll assume H=10 for example.\n\nFrom turn 59 to 68, for 10 turns.\n\nTurn t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=10, turns 59 to 68.\n\nActions for Alice.\n\nAt turn 59, Alice does I to pick up from (3,2).\n\nThen turn 60: change orientation to down, so action D for change orientation down.\n\nHow to specify change orientation?\n\nThe actions are U,D,L,R for move or change orientation, but it's the same symbol, so I need to indicate.\n\nThe action set includes Change Orientation, so for change orientation down, it's 'D', but it could be confused with move down.\n\nIn the context, when move is not possible, it might be change orientation, but it's ambiguous.\n\nFor example, if she does 'D' at (3,1), she cannot move down because (3,0) not empty, so if she does 'D', it might be interpreted as change orientation, or as move attempt that fails.\n\nThe rules don't specify what happens when move is impossible.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, I think for planning, we can use the actions as defined.\n\nPerhaps in this environment, when you perform a move action, if the tile is empty, you move and face that direction; if not, you don't move and orientation doesn't change.\n\nFor change orientation, you change orientation without moving.\n\nFor interact, you interact with the faced tile if adjacent and conditions.\n\nSo for Alice at turn 60, to face down, she should use Change Orientation D.\n\nBut in the action list, it's \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\", so the action is specified as such, but in the answer format, it's the same symbols.\n\nThe answer format says \"each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\)\", so U,D,L,R can be move or change orientation, but it's not distinguished.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nLet's read the action definition:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.  \n- Interact (I): ...\n- Stay (S): Do nothing.\"\n\nBut in the action set for the answer, it's listed as U,D,L,R,I,S, so U,D,L,R can mean either move or change orientation, but it's not specified which one.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps in practice, the action is interpreted based on context, but for planning, I need to specify.\n\nI think for simplicity, in many implementations, the action U,D,L,R means move if possible, else no-op or something.\n\nBut here, Change Orientation is separate.\n\nTo resolve, I'll assume that when a player intends to change orientation, they use the Change Orientation action, which is separate from Move.\n\nBut in the answer format, it's not distinguished; all are U,D,L,R.\n\nPerhaps the actions are: for Move, it's one of L/R/U/D, for Change Orientation, it's also L/R/U/D, but it's the same symbol.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps the \"Change Orientation\" action is not used; players only move or interact or stay.\n\nBut the rules include Change Orientation.\n\nLet's see the interact condition: \"Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo to interact, they need to be facing the tile, so they may need to change orientation without moving.\n\nSo Change Orientation is necessary.\n\nIn the action list for the answer, it must be that U,D,L,R can mean either, but we need to specify.\n\nFor the sake of this task, I'll use the actions as per the context, and in the plan, when I say 'D' for change orientation, it's 'D' for down orientation change.\n\nBut in the output, it's the same.\n\nI think I have to proceed.\n\nFor Alice at turn 60, after picking up, she needs to face down, so she does Change Orientation D.\n\nSimilarly for other cases.\n\nIn the action sequence, I'll write the action as per the intended meaning.\n\nFor the output, it will be 'D' for that.\n\nNow for Bob, I can suggest but not required.\n\nTo maximize, let's have Alice focus on filling the pot, and Bob can start on another or help.\n\nBut for Alice's actions only.\n\nAt turn 59: Alice I (interact with (3,2) to pick up onion)\n\nTurn 60: Change Orientation D (face down)\n\nTurn 61: I (interact with (3,0) to add onion)\n\nTurn 62: Move L to (2,1) (move left to (2,1), position and orientation left)\n\nTurn 63: Change Orientation U (face up to interact with (2,2))\n\nTurn 64: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 65: Move R to (3,1) (move right to (3,1), position and orientation right)\n\nTurn 66: Change Orientation D (face down)\n\nTurn 67: I (add onion to pot (3,0), now 2 onions)\n\nTurn 68: Move R to (4,1) (move right to (4,1), position and orientation right)\n\nTurn 69: Change Orientation U (face up to interact with (4,2))\n\nTurn 70: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor H=10, up to turn 68 or 69.\n\nTurn t1=59 to t1+9=68 for 10 turns.\n\nSo actions from turn 59 to 68.\n\nTurn 59: I\n\nTurn 60: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 61: I\n\nTurn 62: L (move left)\n\nTurn 63: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 64: I\n\nTurn 65: R (move right)\n\nTurn 66: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 67: I\n\nTurn 68: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nThen at turn 69, she can change orientation U, etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, up to turn 68.\n\nWith this, by turn 67, she has added two onions to the pot at (3,0).\n\nBob can add the third or she can later.\n\nBut for the reward, we can have the soup cooking soon.\n\nThen serving can be done by Alice or Bob.\n\nBut for now, this is a plan for Alice.\n\nTo involve Bob, but since not required, I'll stick to Alice.\n\nSo for the answer, Alice's actions from turn 59 to 68.\n\nTurn 59: I\n\nTurn 60: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 61: I\n\nTurn 62: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 63: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 64: I\n\nTurn 65: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 66: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 67: I\n\nTurn 68: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nAfter this, she can pick up from (4,2) on turn 69, etc.\n\nBut for H=10, this is fine.\n\nPerhaps she can add the third onion faster, but with available onions, it's ok.\n\nAnother onion at (3,2) but she already picked it, empty.\n\nOr (5,2), but she needs to move.\n\nSo this seems reasonable.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should coordinate to fill one pot with 3 onions as quickly as possible to start cooking Recipe 1 (3 onions, 5-turn cook time, 20 reward). Given the current game state, Alice is positioned at (3,1) near multiple onion-bearing kitchen counters and the pot at (3,0). Bob is at (3,3) and can assist by collecting onions from other counters or dispensers. However, since the task requires planning only for Alice, the focus is on her actions to efficiently gather and add onions to the pot at (3,0).\n\n### Key Observations for Optimization:\n- **Proximity to Resources**: Alice can immediately interact with (3,2) (containing an onion) at turn 59 by facing up (current orientation). She can then add onions to the pot at (3,0) by facing down and interacting.\n- **Efficient Path**: After adding the first onion, Alice should collect onions from nearby counters like (2,2) and (4,2) to minimize movement. This avoids unnecessary trips to dispensers, as multiple onions are available on counters.\n- **Cooking and Serving**: Once the pot has 3 onions, cooking starts automatically. Serving can be handled later (e.g., by Alice or Bob) after cooking completes. For this plan (H=10 turns), Alice focuses on filling the pot to near-completion (2 onions added by turn 67).\n- **Bob's Role (Optional Coordination)**: Bob should collect the third onion for the pot or start filling the second pot at (4,0) to parallelize tasks. For example:\n  - Bob can move to (4,2) or (5,4) to gather onions and add to (3,0) or (4,0).\n  - This is not in the action sequence but is recommended for efficiency.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 59 to 68, H=10)\nAlice's actions are planned to add 2 onions to the pot at (3,0) by turn 67, setting up for the third onion to be added soon after. Actions account for orientation changes and movement constraints.\n\n- **Turn 59 (t₁)**: `I` (Interact with (3,2) to pick up onion; Alice is at (3,1), facing up, adjacent to counter).\n- **Turn 60**: `D` (Change orientation to down to face pot at (3,0); move down not possible as (3,0) is non-empty).\n- **Turn 61**: `I` (Interact with (3,0) to add onion; pot now has 1 onion).\n- **Turn 62**: `L` (Move left to (2,1); position and orientation changed to left; (2,1) is empty).\n- **Turn 63**: `U` (Change orientation to up to face (2,2); move up not possible as (2,2) is non-empty).\n- **Turn 64**: `I` (Interact with (2,2) to pick up onion; counter has onion).\n- **Turn 65**: `R` (Move right to (3,1); position and orientation changed to right; (3,1) is empty).\n- **Turn 66**: `D` (Change orientation to down to face pot at (3,0)).\n- **Turn 67**: `I` (Interact with (3,0) to add onion; pot now has 2 onions).\n- **Turn 68**: `R` (Move right to (4,1); position and orientation changed to right; (4,1) is empty, setting up to pick up onion from (4,2) next).\n\n### Outcome After 10 Turns:\n- By turn 67, the pot at (3,0) has 2 onions. Alice is at (4,1) facing right after turn 68.\n- **Next Steps (Beyond H=10)**:\n  - Turn 69: Alice should change orientation to up (`U`) to face (4,2).\n  - Turn 70: Interact (`I`) to pick up onion from (4,2).\n  - Turn 71: Move left to (3,1) (`L`).\n  - Turn 72: Change orientation to down (`D`).\n  - Turn 73: Interact (`I`) to add third onion to pot (3,0), starting cooking (ready at turn 78).\n- Bob should add the third onion to (3,0) sooner if possible (e.g., by bringing an onion from (5,2) or (5,4) by turn 70).\n- After cooking starts, Alice or Bob can fetch a plate from (0,2) and serve at (7,2) for the reward.\n\nThis plan maximizes efficiency by leveraging nearby resources and minimizes idle time. With Bob's help, a second soup could be started at (4,0) for additional reward.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

However, note that we can only control Alice, but we can suggest Bob's actions if it helps coordination. But the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we can also plan for Bob? Actually, the task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can plan for both.\n\nBut note: the environment might not let us control Bob arbitrarily. However, for the sake of planning and coordination, we can assume we can suggest actions for both. But the answer format only shows actions for one? Actually, the format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nIt doesn't specify for which player. But the context says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we must specify for which player? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can output two sequences? But the answer format doesn't have two. Let me re-read:\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob) ...\"\n\nAnd the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nIt doesn't specify which player. This is ambiguous. However, looking at the example in the problem statement, it only shows one sequence. But note that the problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we are primarily controlling Alice? But the task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we can plan for both? How to represent?\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we should output two sequences: one for Alice and one for Bob? But the format doesn't have that. Alternatively, we might be expected to output only Alice's actions? But then how to coordinate? The problem says we can optionally include Bob, so perhaps we can output a joint action? But the format doesn't have two actions per turn.\n\nRe-examining the problem: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" meaning we can plan Bob's actions too? But the answer format only has one action per turn. This is confusing.\n\nLooking at the example environment details, it gives both players' information. And the task is to maximize total reward, which requires both players. So I think we are allowed to plan for both. How to represent in the answer?\n\nI think we should output:\n\nTurn t1: Alice: action, Bob: action\nTurn t1+1: Alice: action, Bob: action\n...\n\nBut the format specified is:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n...\n\nSo it doesn't have two. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only Alice's actions? But then how can we coordinate? We must assume Bob is controlled by another agent? The problem says \"collaborate with Bob\", so we can communicate and Bob will follow? But the task doesn't specify.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that we are to output only Alice's actions, and we have to assume that Bob will act reasonably (since we cannot control him). Alternatively, we can plan Alice's actions while predicting Bob's actions based on his state and history.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we can plan for Bob too. However, the answer format does not support two. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we output Alice's actions, and we assume Bob will act optimally (or we can predict his actions) to coordinate. Alternatively, we can include Bob's actions in the plan by having two lines per turn? But that breaks the format.\n\nAnother idea: the problem might expect that we output the actions for the team as a whole? But that doesn't make sense because each player takes an action.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think we should output only Alice's actions. For Bob, we can describe what we hope he does in the reasoning. Then we plan Alice's actions accordingly, assuming Bob will cooperate.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow us to output a sequence of actions for Alice, and we can note that we are coordinating with Bob by having him do specific actions, but we don't write his actions. But then the answer only has Alice's actions.\n\nI think that is the case because the answer format only has one action per turn. So we are to output Alice's actions for the next H turns. We assume Bob is controlled by another agent and we can communicate so he will do the right thing? Or we must plan based on his current state and history.\n\nBut the problem says: \"based on the current game state and action history of both players\". So we can use Bob's state to predict what he might do.\n\nLet me try to plan for both and then output only Alice's actions, but in the reasoning, we plan for Bob too.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the current state:\n\n- Alice: at (3,1), facing Down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (3,3), facing Right (R), holding one onion.\n\nKitchen Counters with onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (4,2). So there are onions scattered around.\n\nPot at (3,0): has 1 onion, not full, so cooking hasn't started. It needs 2 more onions to start cooking (since recipe requires 3 onions).\n\nRecipe: only one recipe: 3 onions -> reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nThere are no tomato dispensers, so we can only use onions.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nOur goal: to deliver as many soups as possible to get rewards.\n\nCurrent pot at (3,0) has 1 onion. We need 2 more to start cooking. Then after 5 turns, it will be cooked. Then we need to serve it: someone must bring a plate, take the soup, and deliver to (7,2).\n\nWe have two players. Bob is holding an onion. He can put it in the pot? But the pot is at (3,0). Bob is at (3,3). He is facing right. To interact with the pot at (3,0), he must be adjacent and facing it. Currently, he is at (3,3), which is above (3,2), (3,1), then (3,0). So he is 3 steps away. He must move down to (3,2), then (3,1), then (3,0). But note: there are counters and other objects? Let me see the grid.\n\nWe don't have a full grid map, but we have the positions of non-empty tiles. We know:\n\n- Kitchen counters at: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nSo the path from Bob to the pot:\n\nBob at (3,3). The tile (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (3,2) is listed. So Bob cannot step on (3,2) because it's a kitchen counter and non-empty? Actually, kitchen counters are non-empty only if they have an item. We have non-empty kitchen counters: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (4,2). So (3,2) is a kitchen counter but it is empty? The non-empty ones are listed separately. The tile types include kitchen counters, but they can be empty. The non-empty kitchen counters are listed as containing items.\n\nIn the current state, the non-empty kitchen counters are: (5,2) with onion, (5,4) with onion, (6,0) with onion, (2,2) with onion, (4,2) with onion. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter but empty? Because it's not listed as non-empty. Similarly, (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, but currently empty.\n\nSo Bob can step on (3,2)? No, because kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? Actually, the tile types: kitchen counter is a tile type. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that are not empty (i.e., have something). But a kitchen counter is a tile that can be empty or occupied. The rule says:\n\n- **Empty Tile:** Walkable space.\n- **Kitchen Counter:** Temporary item storage. (so it is not an empty tile? Or when it is empty, it is walkable? The rule doesn't explicitly say.\n\nLooking at the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? Or the tile type itself?\n\nThe tile types are: Empty Tile, Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter.\n\nThe rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But what is a non-empty tile? It is a tile that is not empty? And empty tile is defined as walkable. So only empty tiles are walkable? Then dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are not walkable? But that would make movement very restricted.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might mean that players can walk on the tiles that are not occupied by an item? But dispensers and pots are fixed objects.\n\nLooking at the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that have an item? Or tiles that are not of type empty?\n\nI think we must assume that only empty tiles are walkable. Because the rule says \"Empty Tile: Walkable space\", implying others are not.\n\nBut then how do players interact? They must be adjacent and facing.\n\nSo:\n\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Other tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters): not walkable. Players cannot step on them.\n\nTherefore, Bob at (3,3) cannot move down to (3,2) because (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, which is not walkable. Similarly, (3,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter? Let's see the kitchen counter list: the positions are given. (3,2) is in the list of kitchen counters. So it is a kitchen counter tile, hence not walkable.\n\nTherefore, Bob cannot move down from (3,3) to (3,2) because (3,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable.\n\nWhat about other directions? Bob is at (3,3). Adjacent tiles:\n\n- Left: (2,3) -> is it walkable? We don't have information about (2,3). The provided tile types only list specific positions. We must assume that any tile not listed as one of the non-empty types (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) is an empty tile? Or we don't know?\n\nThe environment details only list the positions of the non-empty tiles? Actually, they list:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: [list] -> these are the positions of kitchen counter tiles (regardless of being empty or not?).\n\nThen separately, it lists non-empty kitchen counters: [list of positions with items].\n\nSo the tile at (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, so it is not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, let's list the entire grid? We don't have it, so we must infer.\n\nGiven the kitchen counter positions, we can assume that any tile in the kitchen counter list is a kitchen counter tile and not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, dispensers, pots, serving counters are also not walkable.\n\nOnly tiles not in any of these lists are empty and walkable.\n\nSo for (3,3): \n- Up: (3,4) -> is it a kitchen counter? (3,4) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counter list: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (3,4) is not in the list? Then it might be empty? But we also have onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) -> oh, (3,4) is an onion dispenser! And dispensers are not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is an onion dispenser.\n\nSo (3,3) is surrounded? Let's check:\n\n- Left: (2,3) -> not in any non-empty tile list? Then it is empty? But we have kitchen counter at (2,2), (2,4) but not (2,3). So (2,3) might be empty.\n\n- Right: (4,3) -> not in any non-empty tile list? Then empty.\n\n- Down: (3,2) -> kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n- Up: (3,4) -> onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, Alice is at (3,1). Adjacent:\n\n- Up: (3,2) -> kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n- Down: (3,0) -> pot, not walkable.\n\n- Left: (2,1) -> we don't know. Not in the kitchen counter list? Then empty? Or is it a counter? The kitchen counters include (0,1) and (7,1) but not (2,1). So (2,1) might be empty.\n\n- Right: (4,1) -> not in the list? Then empty.\n\nBut we also have pots at (3,0) and (4,0), so (3,0) and (4,0) are not walkable.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), facing down. She is adjacent to the pot at (3,0) and facing it? Because she is at (3,1) and facing down, so the tile below is (3,0), which is adjacent and she is facing it. So she can interact with the pot.\n\nBut she is holding nothing. The pot has 1 onion and is not full. So she can add an ingredient? But she has none. So she cannot add.\n\nWhat can she do? She can move left or right, or change orientation.\n\nNow, our goal: we need to get two more onions into the pot at (3,0) to start cooking.\n\nBob has one onion. He is at (3,3). He can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3). From there, how to get to the pot? The pot is at (3,0). He must go around.\n\nFor example, if he moves left to (2,3), then he can move down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? So non-empty, not walkable. So he cannot go down from (2,3) to (2,2). Similarly, if he moves right to (4,3), then down to (4,2): (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? So non-empty, not walkable. So Bob is stuck? He cannot get to the pot? That can't be.\n\nHe can drop the onion on a kitchen counter and then move? Or use the kitchen counter to pass items? But he is holding an onion, and we need it in the pot.\n\nAlternatively, he can put the onion on a kitchen counter near him, and then Alice or someone else can pick it up and put in the pot.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1), which is above the pot. She can move to get an onion.\n\nWhere are onions? There are onions on kitchen counters: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (4,2). Also Bob is holding one.\n\nBut (2,2), (4,2) are near Alice? Alice is at (3,1). (2,2) is at left-up, (4,2) at right-up. But she cannot step on them because they are non-empty tiles? No, she can't step on them, but she can interact with them if adjacent and facing.\n\nAlice at (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2) above her? (3,2) is a kitchen counter (empty? because it's not listed in non-empty). But (3,2) is adjacent? (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent vertically. But (3,2) is above (3,1). Alice is at (3,1). If she faces up, she can interact with (3,2). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter. And it is empty? Because it's not in the non-empty list. So she can place an item on it? But she is holding nothing. Or pick up? But it's empty.\n\nThe non-empty kitchen counters are: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (4,2). So (3,2) is empty.\n\nSo Alice can move? She can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1). From (2,1), she can interact with (2,2) if facing up? (2,2) is adjacent and above. Similarly, from (4,1) she can interact with (4,2) facing up.\n\n(2,2) has an onion. So if Alice moves left to (2,1), then faces up and interacts, she can pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) has an onion, so she can go right to (4,1) and face up to pick up the onion from (4,2).\n\nBob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He can put it on a kitchen counter. The nearest empty kitchen counter? For example, (3,2) is empty and adjacent to his position? But he is at (3,3) and (3,2) is below him. But he cannot step on (3,2) because it's a kitchen counter tile. But he can interact with it if he is adjacent and facing it. He is at (3,3), facing right. To interact with (3,2), he must be at a tile adjacent to (3,2) and facing it. Adjacent tiles to (3,2) are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). But (3,1) and (3,3) are above and below? (3,3) is adjacent to (3,2) vertically? Yes, (3,3) is directly above (3,2). So if Bob is at (3,3) and faces down, he is facing (3,2). And (3,2) is adjacent and he is on an empty tile (we assume (3,3) is empty? Actually, (3,3) is not listed as any non-empty tile, so it should be empty and walkable. So Bob can interact with (3,2) by facing down.\n\nHe is holding an onion. He can place it on (3,2) if it is empty. And (3,2) is empty (since not in non-empty list). So he can do:\n\nBob: face down (if not already) and interact to place the onion on (3,2).\n\nThen, Alice is at (3,1). She can move? But (3,2) is now occupied? No, after Bob places it, (3,2) will have an onion. Then Alice, at (3,1), can face up and interact to pick up that onion? But she is at (3,1) and (3,2) is above her, so if she faces up, she can pick up the onion from (3,2).\n\nThen she can face down and interact to put it in the pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, we need one more onion.\n\nThere are onions on (2,2), (4,2), etc. Alice can pick up one from (3,2) (placed by Bob), then put in pot. Then she needs another onion.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can get another onion and put on (3,2) or bring it.\n\nBut Bob, after placing the onion, is free. He can go to get another onion.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). But Bob is at (3,3). After placing, he is at (3,3) holding nothing. He can move to (3,4)? But (3,4) is an onion dispenser, not walkable. He must be adjacent to interact. So he can move to (3,3) and face up to interact with (3,4)? But (3,4) is above him. So if he is at (3,3), facing up, he can interact to get an onion.\n\nSimilarly, he can then put it on (3,2) again, or bring it to the pot? But he cannot go to the pot directly.\n\nSo plan:\n\nFirst, Bob should place the onion he is holding on (3,2). He is at (3,3), so he can:\n\nTurn 63: Bob: change orientation to Down (if not already down? He is facing right, so he needs to change to down). Then interact.\n\nBut we can only control Alice? Or we can suggest for Bob.\n\nSince we are to output only Alice's actions, we must assume that Bob will do the reasonable thing. Or we can plan Alice's actions based on what we hope Bob does.\n\nGiven the time, let's assume that Bob will cooperate and we can communicate.\n\nFor turn 63:\n\nBob: change orientation to D (if not already) and then interact to place onion on (3,2). But he is facing right, so he must change to down first. So he needs two actions: first change to down, then interact.\n\nBut in one turn, he can only do one action. So on turn 63, Bob can change orientation to down. Then on turn 64, he can interact to place.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (3,1) facing down. She can do nothing with the pot (since she has no item). She can wait or move to be ready.\n\nBut to be efficient, Alice can move to a position to pick up the onion from (3,2) once Bob places it.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (3,1). She is already adjacent to (3,2) above her. So she can face up and then when the onion is placed, she can pick it up.\n\nBut Bob will place it on turn 64? If he changes to down on turn 63, then places on turn 64.\n\nSo on turn 63, Alice can change orientation to up (since she is facing down now) to be ready to pick up from (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 64, after Bob places the onion on (3,2), Alice can interact to pick it up.\n\nThen, Alice is holding an onion. She can then face down (to face the pot at (3,0)) and interact to put it in the pot.\n\nBut after picking up, she is at (3,1) facing up? Then she needs to change to down to face the pot.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 63:\nAlice: change orientation to Up (since she is facing down, she needs to turn to up to face (3,2)).\nBob: change orientation to Down.\n\nTurn 64:\nAlice: Interact (to pick up onion from (3,2)) -- but only if Bob has placed it. Bob will interact to place on this turn, so the onion appears at the end of Bob's action? Or during? We assume that after both players act, the state updates.\n\nSo after turn 64, the onion is on (3,2) and Alice picks it up, so she is holding an onion.\n\nThen turn 65: Alice changes orientation to Down (to face the pot at (3,0)).\nTurn 66: Alice interacts to put the onion in the pot. Now the pot has 2 onions (previously 1, plus this one). So now 2 onions, still not full.\n\nWe need one more onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob, after placing the onion on turn 64, is at (3,3) holding nothing. He can then go to get another onion. He can move to (3,4)? No, (3,4) is dispenser, not walkable. So he must interact from (3,3) facing up. He is already facing down after placing? After turn 64, Bob just placed, so he is still at (3,3) facing down? Then to get an onion from (3,4), he needs to face up.\n\nSo turn 65: Bob changes orientation to Up.\nTurn 66: Bob interacts to get an onion from dispenser (3,4).\n\nThen, he is holding an onion. He can place it on (3,2) again? Or try to get it to the pot.\n\nBut placing on (3,2) is efficient. So:\n\nTurn 67: Bob changes orientation to Down (if not already down? He was facing up, so he needs to turn to down).\nTurn 68: Bob interacts to place the onion on (3,2).\n\nThen Alice, after putting an onion in the pot on turn 66, is still at (3,1) holding nothing. She can then pick up the new onion from (3,2) on turn 68.\n\nBut on turn 66, after Alice puts the onion, the pot has 2 onions. We need one more.\n\nAfter turn 66: Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing. She can then on turn 67: change orientation to Up (if she is facing down) to face (3,2). Then on turn 68, after Bob places the onion, she can interact to pick it up.\n\nThen turn 69: she changes to down and turn 70: interacts to put the third onion in the pot.\n\nThen the pot has 3 onions, and cooking starts. It will cook in 5 turns.\n\nBut we are planning for H turns? How many? We can choose H, but we should plan until the soup is delivered? But that might be long.\n\nAlternatively, after the pot is full, we need to get a plate and serve.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate plan to fill the pot.\n\nSo for Alice, actions for the next few turns:\n\nTurn 63: Change orientation to Up (from current Down). So action: U? But U is move up, not change orientation. The actions are:\n\n- Move: L, R, U, D (which change position and orientation)\n- Change Orientation: L, R, U, D? But the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That seems confusing.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThat doesn't make sense. I think there might be a mistake.\n\nRe-read:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. \n- Interact (I): ... \n- Stay (S): Do nothing.\"\n\nThe \"Change Orientation\" action: it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But that seems for move? I think there is a formatting issue.\n\nActually, it might be:\n\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1). [So when you move, you change position and also face that direction?]\n\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): This action only changes orientation, not position. But the description says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That seems misplaced.\n\nI think the \"No move if...\" part is for the Move action. Probably it's a typo.\n\nLooking at: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nAnd then: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the \"No move if...\" is a constraint for Move? But it's written under Change Orientation.\n\nI think it's a mistake. The constraint \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" applies to move actions. So for Move, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty (or not walkable), then the move fails? But the problem doesn't say.\n\nTo clarify, I think:\n\n- Move action: if you try to move in a direction, and the adjacent tile in that direction is walkable (empty), then you move and change orientation to that direction. If not, you don't move, but do you change orientation? The problem doesn't say.\n\n- Change Orientation action: only changes orientation to the specified direction, no move, regardless of the tile.\n\nBut the description for Change Orientation says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which seems irrelevant.\n\nI think it's a documentation error. I will assume that:\n\n- Move (direction): attempts to move in that direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty (walkable), then move and change orientation to that direction. If not, then no move and no orientation change? Or orientation change anyway? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n- Change Orientation (direction): changes the player's orientation to that direction, no move, and no dependency on adjacent tile.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll assume that Change Orientation always changes orientation, and Move moves only if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty.\n\nFor Alice to change from facing down to up, she can use Change Orientation: U.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nSo back to plan.\n\nTurn 63:\nAlice: Change orientation to Up (action: U? But U is move up. How to specify change orientation?\n\nThe actions are listed as: U, D, L, R for both move and change orientation? That is ambiguous.\n\nThe problem says: actions are in {U, D, L, R, I, S}. But U, D, L, R can be either move or change orientation? But we need to distinguish.\n\nLooking back:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): ...\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): ...\n- Interact (I)\n- Stay (S)\"\n\nBut then in the action set, it's {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how to differentiate between move and change orientation?\n\nThis is a problem. Perhaps the action U can mean either, but we have to specify.\n\nAlternatively, the action set is the same, but the effect depends on the context? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. In many environments, the action 'U' can mean \"move up\" or \"face up\" based on a separate action set? But here, the problem lists the actions as U, D, L, R, I, S, without distinguishing.\n\nBut then how to change orientation without moving?\n\nThe problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the \"Change Orientation\" action is also denoted by L/R/U/D, but it is a different action? But the set is the same symbols.\n\nI think the only way is to assume that when a player issues U, D, L, R, it means:\n\n- If the player intended to move, it is a move action.\n- But the problem has two separate actions: Move and Change Orientation.\n\nBut the action set is given as {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so probably U, D, L, R are used for both, but we need to know which one.\n\nPerhaps for a given action U, it means: try to move up if possible, if not, then change orientation to up.\n\nBut the problem says for Change Orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which suggests that for Change Orientation action, it only changes orientation if the adjacent tile is not empty? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a error in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the actions U, D, L, R are move actions that change position and orientation, and there is no separate change orientation action. Because the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S} and U is listed under Move.\n\nBut then how to change orientation without moving? The problem mentions \"Change Orientation\" as an action.\n\nPerhaps the \"Change Orientation\" action is also represented by U, D, L, R, but it's a different mode.\n\nBut the answer format doesn't distinguish.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the action is the same, but if the move is not possible, then it changes orientation. But the problem doesn't say that.\n\nTo resolve, I will assume that:\n\n- If a player issues U, D, L, or R, it means they are trying to move in that direction. If the move is possible (adjacent tile is empty and walkable), then they move and change orientation to that direction. If the move is not possible, then they change orientation to that direction without moving.\n\nThis is a common implementation in some games.\n\nSo for Alice at (3,1), if she issues U (move up), but (3,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable, so she cannot move. Then she will change orientation to Up.\n\nSimilarly, if she issues U and it is walkable, she moves and faces up.\n\nIn this case, for Alice to change to face up, she can issue U. Since (3,2) is not walkable, she won't move, but will change orientation to Up.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nSo actions U, D, L, R can have dual effect: move if possible, else change orientation.\n\nSo for our plan:\n\nTurn 63:\nAlice: wants to face up. She is at (3,1), tile above (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So if she does U, she will not move but change orientation to Up.\n\nBob: wants to face down. He is at (3,3), tile below (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So if he does D, he will not move but change orientation to Down.\n\nTurn 64:\nAlice: wants to interact with (3,2) to pick up onion. But only after Bob places it. Bob will interact to place on this turn.\n\nBob: do I to place the onion on (3,2).\n\nThen after Bob's action, (3,2) has an onion. Alice, facing up and adjacent, can interact to pick it up.\n\nAlice action: I (interact)\n\nTurn 65:\nAlice: now holding onion, wants to face down to interact with pot. She can do D (move down). But below is (3,0) pot, not walkable, so she will not move but change orientation to Down.\n\nBob: after placing, he is at (3,3) facing down. He wants to get an onion from dispenser (3,4) above. So he can do U (move up). But (3,4) is dispenser, not walkable, so he will change orientation to Up.\n\nTurn 66:\nAlice: facing down, can interact with pot (3,0) to put onion. So action: I. Now pot has 2 onions (1+1).\n\nBob: facing up, can interact with dispenser (3,4) to get onion. Action: I. Now Bob holding onion.\n\nTurn 67:\nAlice: now holding nothing, she can prepare to pick up the next onion. She is at (3,1) facing down. She can do U to change to face up (since move up not possible).\n\nBob: holding onion, wants to face down to place on (3,2). He is at (3,3) facing up. Do D: move down not possible, so change orientation to Down.\n\nTurn 68:\nAlice: facing up, can interact to pick up onion from (3,2) when Bob places.\n\nBob: do I to place onion on (3,2).\n\nThen Alice picks up the onion.\n\nTurn 69:\nAlice: holding onion, do D to face down (move down not possible).\n\nTurn 70: Alice: I to put onion in pot. Now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nThen cooking will take 5 turns, so at turn 75, the soup is cooked.\n\nMeanwhile, someone needs to get a plate and serve.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBut we are only planning for Alice, and for a few turns. We can plan until the pot is full.\n\nFor Alice, actions from turn 63 to turn 70:\n\nTurn 63: U (change to face up)\nTurn 64: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 65: D (change to face down)\nTurn 66: I (put onion in pot)\nTurn 67: U (change to face up)\nTurn 68: I (pick up onion from (3,2) after Bob places)\nTurn 69: D (change to face down)\nTurn 70: I (put onion in pot)\n\nBut on turn 64, when Alice does I, the onion might not be there if Bob hasn't acted yet? But in the same turn, Bob also acts, so after both actions, the state updates.\n\nIn turn 64, Bob does I to place onion on (3,2), and Alice does I to pick it up. So in the same turn, the onion is placed and then picked up? Or sequentially?\n\nTypically in such games, actions are simultaneous. So if both act on the same tile, it might cause conflict.\n\nSpecifically, if Bob places an item on a counter and Alice picks it up in the same turn, it should be fine: the counter has the item after Bob's action, then Alice can pick it up.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nSimilarly on turn 68.\n\nNow, we also need to consider if Bob does his part. But since we are only outputting Alice's actions, we assume Bob is controlled to cooperate.\n\nIf we want to be safe, we can have Alice wait until the onion is placed, but that wastes turns.\n\nGiven the above, Alice's actions for turns 63 to 70 as above.\n\nBut after turn 70, the pot is full and cooking starts. We might want to continue to get the plate.\n\nBut the task is to plan for the next several turns, say H turns. We can choose H=8 or so.\n\nAlternatively, after the pot is full, Alice can go to get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). Alice is at (3,1) after turn 70.\n\nTo go to (0,2), she needs to move left and up. But the grid has kitchen counters, so she must go around.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move left to (2,1), then up? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter with onion, not walkable. So she must go around.\n\nPath: from (3,1) -> (2,1) [empty?] -> then to (1,1)? But (1,1) is not in kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters include (0,1) and (7,1), but not (1,1), so (1,1) is empty. Then to (1,2)? (1,2) is not in kitchen counter list? Then empty. But (0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo she can move to (1,2), then face left to interact with plate dispenser (0,2).\n\nSimilarly, the serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nBut since cooking takes 5 turns, she has time.\n\nBut for now, we can stop at turn 70.\n\nSo Alice's actions for turns 63 to 70:\n\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: D\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: D\nTurn 70: I\n\nBut let's verify the positions and orientations.\n\nAt turn 63 start:\nAlice: (3,1), facing D, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 63: Alice does U. Since (3,2) not walkable, she doesn't move, but changes orientation to U. Now facing U.\n\nBob: we hope he does D to face down.\n\nTurn 64:\nAlice: does I. She is at (3,1) facing U, so interacts with (3,2). At this moment, if Bob has placed the onion on (3,2) (by doing I), then she picks it up. Now Alice holding onion.\n\nBob: does I to place onion on (3,2).\n\nSo after turn 64: (3,2) has no onion (because Alice picked it up immediately? Or does Bob's action happen first? In simultaneous actions, it might be that Bob places and then Alice picks up in the same turn. So (3,2) is empty at the end.\n\nTurn 65:\nAlice: at (3,1), holding onion, facing U. She wants to face down to interact with pot. Does D: move down not possible (pot at (3,0) not walkable), so changes orientation to D. Now facing D.\n\nBob: after placing, he is at (3,3) facing down, holding nothing. He does U: to change to face up (since move up not possible).\n\nTurn 66:\nAlice: facing D, does I to interact with pot (3,0). Puts onion in pot. Now pot has 2 onions (was 1, now 2). Holding nothing.\n\nBob: facing U, does I to interact with dispenser (3,4). Gets onion. Now holding onion.\n\nTurn 67:\nAlice: at (3,1), facing D, holding nothing. She does U to change to face U (since move up not possible).\n\nBob: at (3,3), holding onion, facing U. He does D to change to face D (move down not possible).\n\nTurn 68:\nAlice: facing U, does I to interact with (3,2). But (3,2) is empty? Bob is about to place an onion.\n\nBob: does I to place onion on (3,2).\n\nSo simultaneously, Bob places onion on (3,2), and Alice interacts with (3,2). So Alice should pick up the onion.\n\nAfter this, Alice holding onion, (3,2) empty.\n\nTurn 69:\nAlice: holding onion, at (3,1), facing U. Does D to change to face D.\n\nBob: at (3,3), facing D, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 70:\nAlice: facing D, does I to put onion in pot. Now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nSo it works.\n\nWe can output Alice's actions for 8 turns.\n\nBut the turn starts at t1=63, so from turn 63 to turn 70 (8 turns).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: D\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: D\nTurn 70: I\n\nBut the action history for Alice was given: U, I, D, I, I (most recent last). So at turn 63, the previous actions are known, but we plan from turn 63 onwards.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: D\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: D\nTurn 70: I\n\nBut we can stop earlier? Or continue? The task says \"over next several turns\", so 8 turns is reasonable.\n\nAfter that, the soup is cooking, and Alice can go for a plate.\n\nBut for now, this should be fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob must coordinate to complete the onion soup recipe (3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns). The pot at (3, 0) already has 1 onion and needs 2 more to start cooking. Bob is holding 1 onion, and additional onions are available on kitchen counters. The plan leverages the central kitchen counter at (3, 2) as a temporary storage for efficient item transfer. Alice's actions focus on retrieving onions from (3, 2) and adding them to the pot, while Bob (expected to cooperate) places onions on (3, 2) and fetches more from the dispenser.\n\n### Key Assumptions:\n- **Bob's Cooperation**: Bob is expected to follow a coordinated plan (detailed in reasoning) to place onions on (3, 2) and fetch new ones.\n- **Action Mechanics**: \n  - `U`, `D`, `L`, `R` actions attempt to move; if movement is blocked (e.g., by a non-walkable tile), the player changes orientation instead.\n  - `I` interacts with the adjacent tile in the current facing direction.\n- **Simultaneous Actions**: Alice and Bob act simultaneously each turn. Item placements (by Bob) and pickups (by Alice) on the same tile in the same turn are feasible without conflict.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 63–70):\n- **Turn 63**: Alice faces up (U) to prepare for interaction with (3, 2). Since (3, 2) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable), `U` changes orientation to up without moving.\n- **Turn 64**: Alice interacts (I) with (3, 2) to pick up the onion placed by Bob (expected action: Bob places onion here this turn).\n- **Turn 65**: Alice faces down (D) to prepare for the pot interaction. Movement down is blocked (pot at (3, 0) is non-walkable), so `D` changes orientation to down.\n- **Turn 66**: Alice interacts (I) with the pot at (3, 0) to add the onion (pot now has 2 onions).\n- **Turn 67**: Alice faces up (U) again to prepare for the next onion pickup. Movement up is blocked, so `U` changes orientation to up.\n- **Turn 68**: Alice interacts (I) with (3, 2) to pick up the second onion placed by Bob (expected action: Bob places another onion here this turn).\n- **Turn 69**: Alice faces down (D) to prepare for the final pot interaction. Movement down is blocked, so `D` changes orientation to down.\n- **Turn 70**: Alice interacts (I) with the pot to add the third onion. The pot now has 3 onions, starting the 5-turn cooking process (soup ready at turn 75).\n\n### Expected Bob Actions (Coordination):\n- **Turn 63**: Bob faces down (D) to prepare for interaction with (3, 2).\n- **Turn 64**: Bob interacts (I) with (3, 2) to place his held onion.\n- **Turn 65**: Bob faces up (U) to prepare for the onion dispenser.\n- **Turn 66**: Bob interacts (I) with the onion dispenser at (3, 4) to grab a new onion.\n- **Turn 67**: Bob faces down (D) to prepare for placing the onion.\n- **Turn 68**: Bob interacts (I) with (3, 2) to place the onion.\n- **Turn 69**: Bob remains idle or fetches another onion for future use.\n- **Turn 70**: Bob remains idle or moves toward the plate dispenser.\n\n### Outcome:\n- By turn 70, the pot at (3, 0) is full and cooking starts. After 5 turns (turn 75), the soup will be ready. Alice can then fetch a plate from (0, 2) and deliver to (7, 2) in subsequent turns for the 20-point reward.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: I \\\\\nTurn 65: D \\\\\nTurn 66: I \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: I \\\\\nTurn 69: D \\\\\nTurn 70: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 66 (t1=66). We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns (H turns) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n- Alice: at (3,1), facing Up, holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (3,3), facing Up, holding nothing.\n\nThe grid has:\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) (but note: we have onions already on counters and in a pot).\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0). Only (3,0) has 1 onion and is not full (so cooking hasn't started).\n- Serving counter at (7,2).\n\nKitchen counters with onions:\n- (5,2): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (6,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n\nThere are no tomato dispensers, and the only recipe is 3 onions (reward 20, cook time 5 turns).\n\nWe note that the pot at (3,0) already has 1 onion. We need 2 more onions to complete the recipe. There are plenty of onions on the counters.\n\nGoal: We want to deliver a 3-onion soup as soon as possible to get the 20 reward. Also, we might consider starting another soup in the other pot (at (4,0)) if possible.\n\nHowever, note that the pot (3,0) is at (3,0). Alice is at (3,1) and facing up. But the pot is below her? Let's see the positions:\n\n- Alice: (3,1) -> above (3,0) is at (3,0). But she is facing up (towards (3,2)). So she is not facing the pot (which is at (3,0) below her).\n\nBob is at (3,3) facing up (towards (3,4)).\n\nPlan:\n\nWe have a pot at (3,0) that already has 1 onion. We need to add 2 more onions. There are onions at:\n- (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,4), (6,0)\n\nWe can pick up onions from these counters and put them in the pot.\n\nAlso, we need to get a plate to serve the soup once it's cooked. The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) hasn't started cooking because it only has 1 onion. We need to add two more. Then it will start cooking and take 5 turns.\n\nAfter 5 turns, we need to serve it.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Get two more onions into the pot at (3,0).\n2. Wait for the soup to cook (5 turns).\n3. Get a plate and serve the soup at (7,2).\n\nBut we have two players. We can coordinate.\n\nLet's see the positions:\n\nAlice is at (3,1). She can move down to (3,0) to interact with the pot? But note: to interact with the pot at (3,0), she must be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent tiles to (3,0) are (2,0), (4,0), (3,1). So Alice is at (3,1) which is adjacent. But she is facing up (towards (3,2)), so she is not facing the pot. She needs to face down to interact with the pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3) and the pot (3,0) is two tiles below. He can move to (3,2) and then to (3,1) and then (3,0)? But that would take multiple moves.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onions on the counters that are closer.\n\nConsider the onion at (3,2). Alice is at (3,1) and facing up. (3,2) is directly above her. So if she moves up to (3,2), she can pick up the onion? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. However, note that to pick up an item from a kitchen counter, she must be adjacent and facing it. If she moves to (3,2), then she is standing on the counter? But the rules say: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? Actually, a kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? But the tile types: kitchen counter is a tile that can hold items. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note: a kitchen counter is a tile that is always present, and it can be occupied by an item or not. The rule for walking: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? Actually, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? Or the tile type itself?\n\nLooking back: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined in the context of the grid? Actually, the grid has tile types: empty tile is walkable, but dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter are non-empty? The rule says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and the others are not? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning non-empty as in having an item? Or the tile type?\n\nBut the tile types are fixed. The grid has fixed tile types. The dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are fixed and are not walkable? Or are they walkable?\n\nLooking at the rules: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nThis implies that the player must be on an adjacent empty tile. Therefore, the dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are NOT walkable? Because if they were walkable, the player could stand on them. But the rule says the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the non-empty tile.\n\nSo, the non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are obstacles that players cannot walk on. Only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nTherefore, the positions (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So Alice cannot move to (3,2). She must interact with it from an adjacent empty tile.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,2) are: (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,3). But note:\n- (2,2) is a kitchen counter (with onion) -> non-walkable.\n- (4,2) is a kitchen counter (with onion) -> non-walkable.\n- (3,1) is where Alice is -> empty? Actually, we don't know the type of (3,1). The tile types list doesn't include (3,1). So it must be an empty tile (walkable). Similarly, (3,3) is where Bob is -> but Bob is standing there? The rule says players cannot walk onto each other, but the tile itself might be empty? However, Bob is currently at (3,3), so (3,3) is occupied by Bob and is not walkable for Alice.\n\nSo for Alice to interact with the onion at (3,2), she must be at an adjacent empty tile and facing (3,2). The adjacent empty tiles to (3,2) are (3,1) and (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by Bob. So only (3,1) is available. Alice is already at (3,1) and facing up. Since (3,2) is directly above, she is facing it. So she can interact to pick up the onion? But she is holding nothing -> she can pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nBut wait: the rule for interacting with a kitchen counter: \"Pick up items (if player is empty-handed and counter is occupied)\". So yes.\n\nSo Alice can do:\n\nTurn 66: Interact (I) to pick up the onion at (3,2).\n\nThen she will be holding an onion.\n\nNow, she needs to put it in the pot at (3,0). She is at (3,1) and the pot is at (3,0) below her. She is facing up. To interact with the pot, she must face down. So:\n\nTurn 67: Change orientation to Down (D) -> now facing down towards (3,0).\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 68: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nNow the pot at (3,0) will have 2 onions.\n\nWe need one more onion.\n\nThere are onions at (2,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,4), (6,0). The closest to Alice is (2,2) or (4,2). But note: (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2) which is non-walkable. The adjacent empty tiles to (2,2) are: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3). Similarly for (4,2): adjacent empty tiles are (4,1), (5,2) (but (5,2) is a kitchen counter, so non-walkable), (4,3). \n\nBut Alice is at (3,1). She can move to (2,1) to interact with (2,2)? Or to (4,1) for (4,2). Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,1):\n- To go to (2,1): move Left (L) -> (2,1). Then face up to interact with (2,2)? But (2,2) is above (2,1). So:\n  - Turn 69: Move Left to (2,1)\n  - Turn 70: Change orientation to Up (U)\n  - Turn 71: Interact to pick up onion at (2,2)\n\nThen she has an onion. Then she must go back to (3,1) to put it in the pot? But she can put it in the pot from (2,1)? The pot at (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0) (which is a kitchen counter, non-walkable), (4,0) (pot, non-walkable), (3,1). So from (2,1), she is not adjacent to the pot. Adjacent tiles to (3,0) are (3,1), (2,0), (4,0). (2,0) and (4,0) are non-walkable. So only (3,1) is adjacent. Therefore, she must be at (3,1) and facing down to interact with the pot.\n\nSo after picking up the onion at (2,2), she must:\n\n- Turn 72: Move Right to (3,1)\n- Turn 73: Face Down (if not already) -> but she was facing up at (2,2), so after moving to (3,1) she is facing right? Actually, movement changes orientation? The rule says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when she moves, her orientation changes to the direction of movement.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1) from (2,1) by moving Right, she will be facing Right. Then she must change to Down.\n\n- Turn 74: Change orientation to Down (D)\n- Turn 75: Interact to put the onion.\n\nThat's a lot of steps. Alternatively, Bob can help.\n\nBob is at (3,3) and holding nothing. There is an onion at (4,2). Bob can move to (4,3) (if it's empty) or (4,2) is non-walkable, so he must be adjacent. Adjacent to (4,2) are (4,1), (4,3), (3,2) (non-walkable), (5,2) (non-walkable). So (4,1) and (4,3) are the only possibilities. (4,3) is not listed in the non-empty tiles, so it might be empty. Similarly, (4,1) might be empty.\n\nBob is at (3,3). He can move right to (4,3) (if it's walkable). Then from (4,3), he can face up? But (4,2) is above (4,3). So he can face up and interact? But (4,3) is below (4,2) so he must face up.\n\nBut note: (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2). So:\n\n- Bob: \n  Turn 66: Move Right to (4,3) -> now at (4,3) and facing right? But the move changes orientation: if he moves right, he faces right. Then he must change to up.\n  Turn 67: Change orientation to Up (U)\n  Turn 68: Interact to pick up the onion at (4,2)\n\nThen Bob is holding an onion. Now he needs to put it in the pot at (3,0). He is at (4,3). How to get to (3,1) (the only adjacent empty tile to the pot)? He can move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is non-walkable. So he must go around? The path: (4,3) -> (4,2) is blocked, so he must go down? (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked, so he can go to (4,4)? But (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable. So he must go to (3,3) -> then (3,2) is blocked. Then down? (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked. Then he can go to (3,4)? (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable. So he is stuck? \n\nAlternatively, he can go to (4,3) -> (5,3) if (5,3) is empty? We don't have a map of all tiles. We only know the non-empty tiles. We can assume that any tile not listed as non-empty (kitchen counter, dispenser, pot, serving) is empty? But the kitchen counters are listed at specific positions. We don't know about (5,3). Similarly, (3,1) is occupied by Alice at the moment.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try a simpler approach: use the onion at (3,2) for Alice and then have Bob get the next onion from a counter that is closer to the pot? Or Bob can get a plate.\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) will have 2 onions after Alice puts one in. We need one more. There is an onion at (6,0). (6,0) is a kitchen counter. Adjacent empty tiles: (5,0) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable), (6,1) (if empty), (7,0) is kitchen counter (non-walkable). So (6,1) must be the adjacent tile. Also, (5,0) and (7,0) are non-walkable.\n\nBut (6,0) is at (6,0). The pot is at (3,0). The distance is long.\n\nAlternatively, there is an onion at (5,2). Adjacent empty tiles: (5,1), (5,3), (4,2) (non-walkable), (6,2) (if empty). So (5,1) and (5,3) are candidates.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,3). He can move to (4,3) -> then to (5,3) (if walkable) to pick up the onion at (5,2) from (5,3) by facing up? (5,2) is above (5,3). Then he can carry it to the pot? But again, he has to go to (3,1) to put it in the pot. That would be: (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) blocked -> so he must go (5,3) to (5,2) blocked -> so he has to go (5,3) to (5,4)? (5,4) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-walkable. So stuck? \n\nWait, from (5,3) he can move left to (4,3) -> then down to (4,2) blocked? Or (4,3) to (4,4) blocked. So he must go to (3,3) -> then down? But (3,2) blocked. So he cannot get to (3,1) from the east? He can go down to (3,2) is blocked, so he must go to (2,3) or (4,3) and then down? But (3,2) blocks the vertical path. So he must go around? \n\nAlternatively, he can go to (4,3) -> (4,2) is blocked -> so he can go to (4,1)? But (4,1) is adjacent to the pot at (4,0) but we are interested in (3,0). The pot at (4,0) is empty. But we are focusing on the pot at (3,0). From (4,1), he can move left to (3,1) to interact with (3,0). But (3,1) might be occupied by Alice.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nBetter: after Alice puts the first onion (from (3,2)) into the pot (at turn 68), the pot will have 2 onions. Then Alice can immediately pick up the next onion from (2,2) or (4,2). But note (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1). Alice is at (3,1) and can move right to (4,1) (if empty). Then face up to pick up the onion at (4,2). Then face down to put in the pot? But from (4,1), she is adjacent to the pot at (4,0) but not to (3,0). So she must go back to (3,1) to put in the pot at (3,0).\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts the first onion, she can stay at (3,1) and Bob can bring the next onion. But Bob would need to pick up an onion and come to (3,1). But (3,1) is occupied by Alice, so Bob cannot stand there. He must wait until Alice moves.\n\nSo let's have Alice move away after putting the second onion? But she can also be the one to get the plate.\n\nAnother idea: use the onion at (5,4) or (6,0) for the third onion? But they are far.\n\nBut note: there is an onion at (6,0) which is near the pot? (6,0) is a kitchen counter. The pot at (3,0) is at (3,0). The distance is 3 in x. But the path: from (6,0) to (3,0): the tiles in between: (5,0) is kitchen counter, (4,0) is pot, (3,0) is pot. So the only adjacent tile to (6,0) is (6,1). Then from (6,1), how to get to (3,1)? The row y=1: (3,1) is occupied by Alice? And (4,1) might be available. But (5,1) and (6,1) are available? We don't know.\n\nThis is too vague.\n\nLet's count the steps for Alice to get the onion at (4,2) after she puts the first onion:\n\nAt turn 68: Alice at (3,1) holding nothing (after putting the onion in the pot).\n\nTurn 69: Move right to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing right.\n\nTurn 70: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (4,2).\n\nTurn 71: Interact to pick up onion at (4,2).\n\nNow she is holding an onion. Then:\n\nTurn 72: Change orientation to Down (D) to face (4,0) -> but we want to put in (3,0). From (4,1), she can interact with the pot at (4,0) (if we want to start another soup) but we are focused on (3,0). So she must go to (3,1).\n\nTurn 73: Move left to (3,1) -> now facing left? (because move left changes orientation to left).\n\nTurn 74: Change orientation to Down (D) to face (3,0).\n\nTurn 75: Interact to put the onion.\n\nNow the pot at (3,0) has 3 onions and starts cooking at turn 75. Then it will be ready at turn 75 + 5 = turn 80.\n\nMeanwhile, we can have Bob get a plate from (0,2) and be ready to serve at turn 80.\n\nBob is at (3,3) initially.\n\nTo get to (0,2):\n- (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> then to (0,2)? But (0,3) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable) -> so cannot go to (0,3). The kitchen counters are at (0,3) and (7,3). So the path to (0,2) must be via (0,1) or (0,4)? (0,4) is a kitchen counter. (0,1) is a kitchen counter. So how to reach (0,2)? The only adjacent empty tiles to (0,2) are (0,1) (kitchen counter, non-walkable), (0,3) (kitchen counter, non-walkable), (1,2). So only (1,2) is adjacent.\n\nBob must go to (1,2). How to get to (1,2) from (3,3)? \n- He can go: (3,3) -> (2,3) [if (2,3) is empty] -> (1,3) [if (1,3) is empty] -> then to (1,2) [if (1,2) is empty]. Then from (1,2) he can face right to interact with (0,2) (plate dispenser) to grab a plate.\n\nBut (1,3) and (2,3) are not listed as non-empty, so they are empty (walkable).\n\nSo:\n- Turn 66: Bob moves Left to (2,3) -> facing left.\n- Turn 67: Move Left to (1,3) -> facing left.\n- Turn 68: Move Down? To (1,2). But he is at (1,3) and facing left. To move down, he must change orientation? Or can he move down? The move action changes orientation. So:\n  Turn 68: Move Down to (1,2) -> now facing down.\n- Turn 69: Interact with (0,2) to grab a plate. (He is at (1,2) facing down? But (0,2) is to the left. So he must face left. So:\n  Actually, after moving down to (1,2), he is facing down. He must change to left.\n  Turn 69: Change orientation to Left (L)\n  Turn 70: Interact to grab plate.\n\nThen he is holding a plate. Then he must wait for the soup to be ready and then serve it.\n\nThe soup will be ready at turn 80. He is at (1,2) at turn 70. He can go to (7,2) to serve, but that is far. Alternatively, he can go to (3,1) to be near the pot? But the pot is at (3,0). He can serve from (3,1) by facing down? Yes, but only after the soup is cooked.\n\nHe can wait at (3,1). But Alice might be there.\n\nSo after Bob gets the plate, he can move to (3,1) to be ready to serve. But note: Alice might be using (3,1) for other tasks.\n\nLet's synchronize:\n\nAt turn 66:\n- Alice: Interact to pick up onion at (3,2) (from (3,1) facing up).\n- Bob: Move Left to (2,3)\n\nTurn 67:\n- Alice: Change orientation to Down (to face the pot at (3,0))\n- Bob: Move Left to (1,3)\n\nTurn 68:\n- Alice: Interact to put onion in pot (now pot has 2 onions)\n- Bob: Move Down to (1,2)\n\nTurn 69:\n- Alice: Move Right to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing right.\n- Bob: Change orientation to Left (to face (0,2))\n\nTurn 70:\n- Alice: Change orientation to Up (to face (4,2))\n- Bob: Interact to grab plate (now Bob has plate)\n\nTurn 71:\n- Alice: Interact to pick up onion at (4,2)\n- Bob: Start moving towards (3,1). From (1,2): \n  - Move Up to (1,3) -> facing up.\n  - Then move Right to (2,3) -> facing right.\n  - Then move Right to (3,3) -> facing right.\n  - Then move Down to (3,2) -> blocked! (3,2) is kitchen counter. So cannot.\n\nBob cannot go down from (3,3) because (3,2) is blocked. So he must go via (4,3). \n\nFrom (1,2):\n- Turn 71: Bob move Up to (1,3) -> facing up.\n- Turn 72: move Right to (2,3) -> facing right.\n- Turn 73: move Right to (3,3) -> facing right.\n- Turn 74: move Right to (4,3) -> facing right.\n- Turn 75: move Down to (4,2) -> blocked. So he must move down to (4,1) if possible? \n  - From (4,3) move Down to (4,2) blocked -> so he must move down to (4,1) by going (4,3)->(4,2) blocked, so he cannot. \n\nThe only way down is to go to (3,1) but that is occupied by Alice at some points.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go from (1,2) to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-walkable. So he cannot. He must go up to (1,3) and then right to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and then down? But from (4,3) he can move down to (4,2) is blocked, so he must go to (5,3) -> (5,2) blocked, so he can go to (5,4) blocked. So he is stuck in the east.\n\nThe only way to (3,1) is from the north? But (3,2) is blocked. So he cannot reach (3,1) from the north. He must come from the south? But the pot is at (3,0), and (3,1) is the only access. And from the south: (3,3) to (3,2) blocked. So he cannot reach (3,1) at all? That can't be right.\n\nWhat about (3,4)? (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable. So no.\n\nTherefore, the only player who can serve the soup at (3,0) is the one at (3,1). So Alice should be the one to serve.\n\nSo plan: Alice finishes putting the third onion at turn 75. Then she can go get a plate and serve.\n\nBut the plate dispenser is at (0,2). She is at (3,1) at turn 75.\n\nShe can go to (0,2) via:\n- (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> but (0,1) is kitchen counter, non-walkable. So she must go to (1,2) and then to (0,2) via (1,2). But (1,2) might be occupied by Bob? \n\nFrom (3,1):\n- Move left to (2,1) -> turn 76\n- Move up to (2,2) -> blocked. So cannot. \n- From (2,1), she can move up to (2,2) blocked. So she must go to (1,1) first? But (1,1) is not listed as non-empty, so walkable.\n  - Turn 76: move left to (2,1)\n  - Turn 77: move left to (1,1)\n  - Turn 78: move up to (1,2) -> if available\n  - Turn 79: change orientation to left to face (0,2)\n  - Turn 80: interact to grab plate.\n\nThen she has a plate. Then she must go back to (3,1) to serve the soup at (3,0).\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 80. She is at (0,2) at turn 80. Then:\n\n- Turn 81: move right to (1,2)\n- Turn 82: move down to (1,1)\n- Turn 83: move right to (2,1)\n- Turn 84: move right to (3,1) -> now at (3,1) facing right.\n- Turn 85: change orientation to down\n- Turn 86: interact to serve the soup.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nAlternatively, after the soup is ready, she can serve it immediately if she is at (3,1) with a plate. But she is not.\n\nBob has the plate, but he cannot reach (3,1). So we must have Alice get the plate earlier.\n\nRevised plan:\n\nWe have two players. Alice will handle the pot and also get the plate. Bob can help by getting the third onion? Or we can have Bob get the plate while Alice is getting the third onion.\n\nBut Bob can get the plate and then wait at (1,2) or somewhere else. Then when the soup is ready, Alice can get the plate from Bob? But how? They would have to meet at a kitchen counter to transfer the plate.\n\nKitchen counters are at various places. For example, there is a kitchen counter at (2,2) with an onion. But they can use an empty kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at many locations. But most are occupied by onions. Are there any empty kitchen counters? The list of non-empty kitchen counters: \n- (5,2): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (6,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n\nSo all kitchen counters listed have onions. But there are other kitchen counters that are empty? The kitchen counter positions include: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4).\n\nSome of these are not listed as having items, so they are empty? The current state says: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" and lists only those with onions. So the others are empty.\n\nFor example, (0,0) is a kitchen counter and not listed as non-empty, so it is empty. Similarly, (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (6,4), (7,4) are empty kitchen counters.\n\nSo Bob can place the plate on an empty kitchen counter, and Alice can pick it up.\n\nFor example, Bob can place the plate on (2,0) or (1,0) or (0,0) or (7,0), etc.\n\nBut (2,0) is near the pot? (2,0) is adjacent to (3,0) (the pot) but (2,0) is a kitchen counter, so non-walkable. The only adjacent empty tile to (2,0) is (2,1) or (1,0) (kitchen counter) or (3,0) (pot) -> so only (2,1) is adjacent. So Alice can pick up from (2,0) by being at (2,1) and facing up? (2,0) is below (2,1)? So she would face down.\n\nSo plan:\n\nBob gets the plate and places it on (2,0) (or (1,0) or (0,0)). The closest to the pot is (2,0).\n\nBob's journey to (2,0):\n- At turn 66: Bob moves Left to (2,3)\n- Turn 67: move Left to (1,3)\n- Turn 68: move Down to (1,2)\n- Turn 69: change orientation to Left and interact to grab plate at (0,2) -> now holding plate.\n- Then he needs to go to (2,1) to place the plate on (2,0)? Or he can place it from (1,1) on (1,0)? But let's do (2,0).\n\nFrom (1,2):\n- Turn 70: move Down to (1,1) -> now at (1,1) facing down.\n- Turn 71: move Right to (2,1) -> facing right.\n- Turn 72: change orientation to Up (U) to face (2,0) which is above.\n- Turn 73: interact to place the plate on (2,0).\n\nThen the plate is on (2,0).\n\nAlice, after putting the third onion in the pot at turn 75 (as in the earlier schedule), can then go to (2,1) and face up to pick up the plate from (2,0) at turn 76.\n\nThen she can move to (3,1) and face down to serve the soup at turn 77 or 78.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 80? Let's check the cooking start time.\n\nThe pot will have 3 onions at turn 75. It starts cooking immediately and will be ready at turn 75 + 5 = turn 80. So at turn 80, the soup is ready.\n\nAlice cannot serve before turn 80.\n\nSo at turn 80, Alice must be at (3,1) facing down and holding the plate with the soup? No, to serve the soup from the pot, she must interact with the pot while holding a clean plate? Then she gets the soup in the plate. Then she must deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nWe have two steps:\n1. Use the clean plate to get the soup from the pot -> this yields a held soup-in-plate.\n2. Deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nSo after the soup is ready, Alice can:\n\n- At turn 80: if she is at (3,1) facing down and holding a clean plate, she can interact to get the soup.\n- Then she must go to (7,2) to deliver.\n\nThe journey from (3,1) to (7,2):\n- (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (7,1) -> then to (7,2)? But (7,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So cannot. The only adjacent to (7,2) is (7,1) (kitchen counter), (7,3) (kitchen counter), (6,2) (if empty). So she must go to (6,2) which is not listed, so empty? Then from (6,2) she can face right to interact with (7,2).\n\nSo path:\n- Turn 81: move right to (4,1)\n- Turn 82: move right to (5,1) \n- Turn 83: move right to (6,1)\n- Turn 84: move up to (6,2) -> now at (6,2) facing up.\n- Turn 85: change orientation to right to face (7,2)\n- Turn 86: interact to deliver.\n\nThis is long.\n\nBob could deliver it if he has the soup, but he doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice gets the soup at turn 80, she can give the soup-in-plate to Bob via a kitchen counter. For example, she places the soup-in-plate on (2,0) or another counter, and Bob picks it up and delivers.\n\nBut Bob is at (2,1) after placing the plate. He can wait at (6,2) for example.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nSince the only recipe is 3 onions, and we are about to complete one, and there is another pot at (4,0) that is empty, we might start a second soup. But for now, let's focus on delivering the first one.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to optimize the first soup.\n\nNew idea: after the pot has 3 onions (at turn 75), Alice can immediately go for the plate, but then the soup will be ready while she is away.\n\nOr, she can get the plate before the soup is ready.\n\nSo after she puts the third onion at turn 75, she has 5 turns to get a plate and be back at (3,1) by turn 80.\n\nFrom turn 75: Alice at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to (0,2) to get a plate and return.\n\nBut as before, it takes:\n- To (0,2): \n  - Turn 76: left to (2,1) [assuming she is at (3,1) and move left to (2,1)]\n  - Turn 77: left to (1,1)\n  - Turn 78: up to (1,2)\n  - Turn 79: face left and interact to grab plate at (0,2) -> but at (1,2) facing left, she can interact with (0,2).\n  So at turn 79, she has the plate.\n- Then return:\n  - Turn 80: move down to (1,1) -> facing down.\n  - Turn 81: move right to (2,1)\n  - Turn 82: move right to (3,1) -> facing right.\n  - Then turn 83: face down and interact to get the soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 80. At turn 80, she is at (1,1), not at (3,1). So she misses turn 80.\n\nShe can only interact with the pot at turn 83.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 80, and it will remain until served. There's no penalty for waiting, so she can serve it at turn 83.\n\nThen she can deliver it.\n\nSo the serving happens at turn 83.\n\nThen she can deliver at turn 89 or so.\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nSo summary for Alice:\n\nTurn 66: I (pick up onion at (3,2))\nTurn 67: D (face down to face (3,0))\nTurn 68: I (put onion in pot, now 2 onions)\nTurn 69: R (move to (4,1))\nTurn 70: U (face up to face (4,2))\nTurn 71: I (pick up onion at (4,2))\nTurn 72: D (face down to face (4,0) - not used, but to prepare for next move)\n But then she needs to go to (3,1) to put in the pot at (3,0). \nTurn 72: L (move left to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1) facing left.\nTurn 73: D (face down)\nTurn 74: I (put onion, now 3 onions) -> but wait, this is turn 74, not 75.\n\nLet's recount from turn 66:\n\n66: I\n67: D\n68: I (2 onions in pot)\n69: R ( to (4,1) facing right)\n70: U (face up)\n71: I (pick onion from (4,2))\n72: L ( to (3,1) facing left)\n73: D (face down)\n74: I ( put onion, now 3 onions at turn 74)\n\nSo the soup starts cooking at turn 74, ready at turn 79.\n\nThen for the plate:\n\nTurn 75: L ( to (2,1) facing left)\nTurn 76: L ( to (1,1) facing left)\nTurn 77: U ( to (1,2) facing up)\nTurn 78: L (face left) [ to face (0,2) ]\nTurn 79: I (grab plate)\nTurn 80: D (face down) and move down to (1,1) -> so action: D (change orientation to down) and then move down? But we can only do one action per turn.\n\nTurn 80: move down to (1,1) -> action: D (move down) -> now at (1,1) facing down.\nTurn 81: move right to (2,1) -> action: R\nTurn 82: move right to (3,1) -> action: R\nTurn 83: change orientation to down: action: D\nTurn 84: interact to get the soup from the pot -> action: I\n\nThen she has the soup on the plate. Then she can deliver:\n\nTurn 85: R ( to (4,1))\nTurn 86: R ( to (5,1))\nTurn 87: R ( to (6,1))\nTurn 88: U ( to (6,2))\nTurn 89: R (face right) to face (7,2)\nTurn 90: I (deliver)\n\nThis is 25 turns from turn 66. And we get one soup delivered.\n\nBut we can do better by having Bob help with the delivery.\n\nAfter Bob places the plate on (2,0) (if we do that), then Alice can pick it up earlier.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nBob's schedule:\n\nTurn 66: L ( to (2,3))\nTurn 67: L ( to (1,3))\nTurn 68: D ( to (1,2))\nTurn 69: L (face left) [ to face (0,2) ]\nTurn 70: I (grab plate)\nTurn 71: D ( to (1,1))\nTurn 72: R ( to (2,1))\nTurn 73: U (face up) [ to face (2,0) ]\nTurn 74: I (place plate on (2,0))\n\nThen Bob has nothing. He can start on another soup or help with delivery.\n\nAlice at turn 74: she is putting the third onion in the pot ( turn 74: I at (3,1) facing down).\n\nThen at turn 75: Alice can move left to (2,1) -> action: L\nTurn 76: U (face up) to face (2,0)\nTurn 77: I (pick up the plate from (2,0))\n\nThen she has the plate at turn 77. The soup will be ready at turn 79 (since cooking started at turn 74, 74+5=79).\n\nSo she has to wait until turn 79.\n\nShe can wait at (2,1) or move to (3,1) and wait.\n\nTurn 78: move right to (3,1) -> action: R\nTurn 79: face down: action: D\nTurn 80: interact to get the soup (since it's turn 80, and soup is ready at 79, so at turn 80 it is ready).\n\nThen she can deliver as before.\n\nThis saves a few turns.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\n66: I (pick onion at (3,2))\n67: D (face down)\n68: I (put in pot, now 2 onions)\n69: R ( to (4,1))\n70: U (face up)\n71: I (pick onion at (4,2))\n72: L ( to (3,1))\n73: D (face down)\n74: I (put in pot, 3 onions, cooking starts)\n75: L ( to (2,1))\n76: U (face up to face (2,0))\n77: I (pick up plate)\n78: R ( to (3,1))\n79: D (face down)\n80: I (get soup from pot)\n81: R ( to (4,1))\n82: R ( to (5,1))\n83: R ( to (6,1))\n84: U ( to (6,2))\n85: R (face right)\n86: I (deliver at (7,2))\n\nThis is 21 turns (from 66 to 86).\n\nAnd Bob's actions are as above.\n\nWe can have Bob help with the second onion or something, but in this case, Alice does most of the work.\n\nAlternatively, after Bob places the plate, he can start on the next soup. For example, get an onion and put in the other pot at (4,0). But that might be for future.\n\nFor now, we plan for Alice.\n\nSo the action sequence for Alice from turn 66 to turn 86 (21 actions) is:\n\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: D\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: R\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: I\nTurn 72: L\nTurn 73: D\nTurn 74: I\nTurn 75: L\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: I\nTurn 78: R\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: R\nTurn 82: R\nTurn 83: R\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: R\nTurn 86: I\n\nBut we may not need to plan that far. We can plan until the soup is delivered or for a fixed H.\n\nSince the instructions say \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", we can choose H=20 or so.\n\nBut to be safe, we output until the delivery.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for Alice's actions. Bob's actions are optional.\n\nWe can output only Alice's actions in the box.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: D\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: R\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: I\nTurn 72: L\nTurn 73: D\nTurn 74: I\nTurn 75: L\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: I\nTurn 78: R\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: R\nTurn 82: R\nTurn 83: R\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: R\nTurn 86: I\n\nThis is 21 actions.\n\nBut we can stop after the soup is in the pot and the plate is got, but the delivery is part of the reward.\n\nSince the question is to maximize the reward, and this sequence delivers one soup for 20 points, it is good.\n\nWe might consider starting the next soup, but that would be beyond H=21.\n\nSo we output this sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, we list from turn 66 to turn 66+20 = 86, but note turn 66 is the first action in the sequence.\n\nThe current turn is t1=66, and we plan for the next actions.\n\nSo actions for Alice:\n\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: D\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: R\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: I\nTurn 72: L\nTurn 73: D\nTurn 74: I\nTurn 75: L\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: I\nTurn 78: R\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: R\nTurn 82: R\nTurn 83: R\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: R\nTurn 86: I\n\nBut turn 86 is turn t1+20 (66+20=86). So if we want H=21 turns, we output 21 actions.\n\nWe can output for as long as we have.\n\nBut the instructions say \"over next several turns\", so we output until the delivery.\n\nSo we'll box this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob will collaborate to complete and deliver the 3-onion soup from the pot at (3,0), which already contains 1 onion. Alice will gather the remaining two onions from nearby kitchen counters, while Bob retrieves a plate and places it on a kitchen counter near the pot for Alice to use. The soup starts cooking at turn 74 (after the third onion is added) and requires 5 turns to cook, becoming ready at turn 79. Alice will serve the soup at turn 80 and deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2) by turn 86, earning a reward of 20.\n\n### Optimized Action Sequence for Alice:\n- **Turns 66-74**: Alice picks up onions from counters and adds them to the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turns 75-77**: Alice retrieves the plate Bob placed on (2,0).\n- **Turns 78-80**: Alice moves to the pot, waits for the soup to cook, and serves it.\n- **Turns 81-86**: Alice delivers the soup to the serving counter.\n\n### Alice's Actions:\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 66: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 67: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 68: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 69: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 70: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 71: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 72: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 73: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 74: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 75: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 76: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 77: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 78: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 79: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 80: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 81: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 82: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 83: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 84: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 85: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 86: I}\n}\n\n### Bob's Actions (Optional but Recommended for Coordination):\n- **Turns 66-70**: Bob retrieves a plate from (0,2).\n- **Turns 71-74**: Bob places the plate on kitchen counter (2,0) for Alice.\n- **Turns 75+**: Bob can start gathering onions for the next soup (e.g., in the pot at (4,0)).\n```\nTurn 66: L  # Move left to (2,3)\nTurn 67: L  # Move left to (1,3)\nTurn 68: D  # Move down to (1,2)\nTurn 69: L  # Face left (toward (0,2))\nTurn 70: I  # Grab plate at (0,2)\nTurn 71: D  # Move down to (1,1)\nTurn 72: R  # Move right to (2,1)\nTurn 73: U  # Face up (toward (2,0))\nTurn 74: I  # Place plate on (2,0)\nTurn 75: U  # (Example) Start next task: move up to (2,2) blocked, so adjust path.\n```\n\n### Key Coordination Insights:\n1. **Efficient Onion Collection**: Alice uses onions from (3,2) and (4,2) (closest to her position), minimizing movement.\n2. **Plate Placement**: Bob places the plate on (2,0) (near the pot), allowing Alice to grab it quickly after adding the last onion.\n3. **Timing Alignment**: Alice serves the soup exactly when it becomes ready (turn 80), and Bob's plate placement (turn 74) ensures no idle time.\n4. **Path Optimization**: Alice's delivery path avoids obstacles (e.g., uses (6,2) to access the serving counter).\n\nThis sequence delivers one soup (20 reward) by turn 86. Future planning could involve using the second pot (4,0) for additional soups.",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 69. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n- Alice is at (3,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (3,3), facing up (U), holding nothing.\n\nThere are two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). The pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and 0 tomatoes (so it needs one more onion to start cooking). The pot at (4,0) is empty.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), and a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nKitchen counters have onions at (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), and (4,2). So there are several onions already placed on counters.\n\nThe serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nThe only recipe we know is: 3 onions -> reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nGiven that the pot at (3,0) already has 2 onions, we can complete it by adding one more onion. Then it will cook for 5 turns and then can be served.\n\nAlternatively, we could start a new pot at (4,0) but that would require 3 onions and then 5 turns of cooking, which might take longer.\n\nBut note: we have many onions already on kitchen counters. We can use those to complete the pot at (3,0) and also to start another pot if needed.\n\nSince we are at turn 69, and we are planning for the next several turns (say H=10 or so, but we can adjust), we should focus on getting the existing pot (3,0) completed and then served.\n\nSteps needed:\n\n1. Get an onion to put into the pot at (3,0). We can get an onion from a kitchen counter or from a dispenser.\n\n   - The closest kitchen counters with onions: \n        (4,2) is at (4,2) -> adjacent to Alice? Alice is at (3,1). The distance: (3,1) to (4,2) is |3-4| + |1-2| = 1+1 = 2, but note that we can only move to adjacent empty tiles and then interact if facing the counter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can get an onion from the dispenser, but the dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4) which are farther.\n\n   But note: there is an onion at (4,2) which is very close to Alice.\n\n   Alice is at (3,1). To get to (4,2):\n\n        From (3,1) to (4,2): \n          Option 1: Right (to (4,1)) then Up (to (4,2))? But (4,1) is what? We need to know the grid.\n\n   However, we don't have a full grid map, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles. We assume that any tile not listed as non-empty (like dispensers, pots, counters) is empty and walkable? Actually, the tile types are given, and we have the list of kitchen counters, etc.\n\n   Let's list the non-empty tiles (that are obstacles) that we cannot walk on:\n\n        Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n        Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n        Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n        Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n        Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\n   So, for example, (4,1) is not in any of these lists? Then it should be empty.\n\n   Similarly, (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so we cannot walk on it.\n\n   So Alice at (3,1) can move right to (4,1) (which is empty) and then up to (4,2) but wait: (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion, so we cannot walk on it. We can only stand adjacent and face it to interact.\n\n   Therefore, to pick up the onion from (4,2):\n\n        Alice is at (3,1). She can move right to (4,1). Then she is adjacent to (4,2) (which is to the north). But her orientation after moving right would be? We have to set orientation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can change orientation without moving? But the action \"Change Orientation\" only if we don't move and the adjacent tile we are facing is non-empty? Actually, the change orientation action: it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> that condition is for when you are trying to move? Actually, the action \"Change Orientation\" (L/R/U/D) does not move, but it changes the orientation regardless? Actually, the rule says:\n\n        \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\n   But that seems to be about the movement? Let me re-read:\n\n        \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\n        \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\n   Actually, the rule for Change Orientation is a bit ambiguous. But note: the rule says that for Interact, you must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it. So for picking up from (4,2), Alice must be at (4,1) and facing up (U) to interact with (4,2).\n\n   So plan for Alice:\n\n        Turn 69: Move right (R) -> to (4,1) and facing right? Actually, when you move, you change both position and orientation to the direction of movement. So if she moves right, she ends at (4,1) facing right (R). Then she is adjacent to (4,2) but not facing it (she is facing right, which is east, but (4,2) is north). So she needs to change orientation to up.\n\n        Then interact.\n\n   So:\n\n        Turn 69: R (move right to (4,1), now facing right)\n        Turn 70: U (change orientation to up) -> now facing (4,2) which is the kitchen counter with an onion.\n        Turn 71: I (interact to pick up the onion) -> now Alice is holding an onion.\n\n   Then, she needs to put it into the pot at (3,0). How?\n\n        From (4,1), she can move left to (3,1) (which is empty) and then down to (3,0)? But (3,0) is a pot, so she cannot walk on it. She must be adjacent and facing it.\n\n        At (3,1), she is adjacent to (3,0) to the south. So she needs to face down.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Turn 72: L (move left to (3,1), now facing left? Actually, moving left changes orientation to left. But then she is at (3,1) facing left, but the pot is at (3,0) which is south. So she needs to change orientation to down.\n\n        Alternatively, from (4,1) she can move down? (4,1) to (4,0) -> but (4,0) is a pot, so she cannot walk on it. So she must go via (3,1).\n\n        So:\n\n          Turn 72: L (move left to (3,1), now facing left)\n          Turn 73: D (change orientation to down) -> now facing (3,0)\n          Turn 74: I (interact to put the onion into the pot at (3,0))\n\n        Now the pot at (3,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking. The cooking time is 5 turns, so it will be ready at turn 69+5 = 74? But we are at turn 74 when we put the onion? Actually, we are at turn 74 when we do the interact. The cooking starts at that turn? And takes 5 turns? Then it will be ready at turn 79.\n\n   But note: we are only planning a few turns. We can plan until we get the pot started and then think about serving.\n\n   Now, what about Bob? Bob is at (3,3) facing up. He can help by getting a plate and then later serving the soup.\n\n   Steps for Bob:\n\n        We need a plate to serve the soup. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (3,3). How to get to (0,2)?\n\n        The path: (3,3) -> (2,3) is empty? (2,3) is not in non-empty tiles -> empty. Then (1,3): empty? (1,3) is not listed -> empty. Then (0,3): is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so we cannot walk on it. So we must go around.\n\n        Alternatively, from (3,3) we can go left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so we cannot walk on it. So we have to avoid that.\n\n        We can go:\n\n          (3,3) -> (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (3,2) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-empty, so we cannot walk on it.\n\n        So we must go:\n\n          (3,3) -> (4,3) [empty?] -> (4,3) is not listed in non-empty, so empty. Then (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so we cannot go to (4,2). Then from (4,3) we can go up? (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, so we cannot go there.\n\n        This is getting complicated. Alternatively, we can go:\n\n          (3,3) -> (3,4) -> but (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, cannot walk.\n\n        So Bob must go left and then up? \n\n          (3,3) -> (2,3) [empty] -> (1,3) [empty] -> (0,3) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, so we stop. Then from (1,3) we can go up to (1,4)? But (1,4) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So that doesn't work.\n\n        How about going down? \n\n          (3,3) -> (3,2) -> but (3,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter), so we cannot.\n\n        Actually, we need a path to (0,2). Note that (0,2) is the plate dispenser. The tile (0,2) is non-empty? Yes, but we don't walk on it. We need to be adjacent and facing it.\n\n        The adjacent tiles to (0,2) are: (0,1) [kitchen counter, non-empty], (0,3) [kitchen counter, non-empty], (1,2) [empty?] and (-1,2) [out of bounds?]. So the only accessible adjacent tile is (1,2). But (1,2) is not in any non-empty list? So it should be empty.\n\n        How to get to (1,2) from (3,3)?\n\n        Path: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2). \n\n        (1,2) is empty? We don't see it in non-empty tiles, so yes. Then Bob can stand at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Bob at (3,3) facing up. He needs to go to (1,2).\n\n          First, he must change orientation? Or move. He can move left to (2,3) and then left to (1,3), then down to (1,2). \n\n          But when moving, the orientation changes to the direction of movement.\n\n          So:\n\n            Turn 69: L (move left to (2,3), now facing left)\n            Turn 70: L (move left to (1,3), now facing left)\n            Turn 71: D (move down to (1,2), now facing down) -> but now he is at (1,2) and the plate dispenser is at (0,2) which is to the left. So he needs to face left.\n\n          Then:\n\n            Turn 72: L (change orientation to left) -> now facing (0,2)\n            Turn 73: I (interact to grab a plate) -> now Bob is holding a plate.\n\n        Then, he must wait until the soup is cooked (at turn 79) and then serve it. But that is 6 turns after we finish the current plan? We are only planning for a few turns (say 10). So we might not get to the serving in this plan.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have Bob help with the pot? But the pot at (3,0) only needs one onion, which Alice is getting. The other pot (4,0) is empty. We could have Bob start filling that pot? But then we need three onions. And we have onions on counters.\n\n        However, the reward for one soup is 20, and if we can get two soups, that would be 40. But the cooking time for the second pot would start later.\n\n        But note: we are at turn 69. The first soup will be ready at turn 79. Then we serve it and get 20. Then if we start the second pot, it would take 5 turns to cook, so ready at turn 84? Then we serve and get 20. But we are only planning for a short horizon.\n\n        Since the problem doesn't specify H, we can plan for about 5-10 turns. Let's plan for 10 turns (until turn 79) to get the first soup started and then Bob getting the plate and waiting.\n\n        But note: the pot at (3,0) will be started at turn 74 (if we follow the above for Alice) and then ready at turn 79. Then at turn 79, we can serve it. But we are only planning until turn 79? We can plan beyond.\n\n        However, the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H=10, so from turn 69 to 78 (10 actions: turns 69 to 78 inclusive? Actually, from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions). Let's set H=10.\n\n        We want to get the soup started and get the plate ready.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n        Alice: \n          Turn 69: R (to (4,1), facing right)\n          Turn 70: U (change orientation to up) -> facing (4,2)\n          Turn 71: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n          Turn 72: L (to (3,1), facing left)\n          Turn 73: D (change orientation to down) -> facing (3,0)\n          Turn 74: I (put onion into pot at (3,0)) -> now the pot starts cooking (will be ready at turn 79)\n\n        Then Alice is free. She can help with the second pot? Or get another plate? But we only have one pot that is about to be ready. We might not need two plates at the same time.\n\n        Bob:\n          Turn 69: L (to (2,3), facing left)\n          Turn 70: L (to (1,3), facing left)\n          Turn 71: D (to (1,2), facing down) -> now at (1,2)\n          Turn 72: L (change orientation to left) -> facing (0,2)\n          Turn 73: I (grab plate) -> now holding plate.\n\n        Then Bob must go to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup when it's ready. But the soup is ready at turn 79. From turn 73 to 78, we have 5 more turns. Bob can wait or move to a position near the pot.\n\n        How to get to the pot from (1,2)? \n\n          (1,2) -> (2,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot walk. So he must go down? (1,2) to (1,1): is (1,1) empty? It's not in non-empty tiles, so yes. Then (1,1) to (2,1): empty? Then (3,1): empty? Then (3,0) is pot -> non-empty, so he cannot stand on it. He must stand adjacent and face it.\n\n          Adjacent tiles to (3,0): (3,1) [south], (2,0) [west] -> (2,0) is kitchen counter (non-empty) so only (3,1) is available.\n\n          So Bob must be at (3,1) and face down to serve.\n\n        Path from (1,2) to (3,1):\n\n          (1,2) -> (1,1) [move down] -> (2,1) [move right] -> (3,1) [move right]\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Turn 74: D (from (1,2) to (1,1), facing down) \n          Turn 75: R (to (2,1), facing right)\n          Turn 76: R (to (3,1), facing right) -> now at (3,1) but facing right, but the pot is at (3,0) which is down. So he needs to face down.\n\n          Turn 77: D (change orientation to down) -> facing (3,0)\n\n        Then at turn 79, the soup is ready. But we are only planning until turn 78 (if H=10, then turns 69 to 78). So we cannot include the serving in the plan. But we can set up Bob to be ready to serve at turn 79.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have Bob wait at (3,1) facing down for turns 78 and 79? But our plan only goes to turn 78.\n\n        Since we are only required to plan for H turns (and H is \"several\", we choose 10), we plan until turn 78.\n\n        Then at turn 79, Bob can interact to serve the soup. But that is beyond our plan.\n\n        Alternatively, we can plan for 11 turns? But the problem says \"next several turns\", so we can choose H=11 to include the serving? However, the problem doesn't specify H, so we must choose a reasonable H that covers the immediate tasks.\n\n        But note: the serving counter is at (7,2). After getting the soup from the pot, Bob will be holding a soup in a plate and then must deliver it to (7,2). That will take more moves.\n\n        So for now, let's plan until Bob is in position to serve the soup at turn 77 (facing the pot at (3,0) from (3,1)). Then at turn 78, he can wait (S) because the soup isn't ready until turn 79.\n\n        Then we stop at turn 78. The serving will happen at turn 79 by Bob (if we continue, but we don't plan beyond).\n\n        So for Bob:\n\n          Turn 74: D (to (1,1))\n          Turn 75: R (to (2,1))\n          Turn 76: R (to (3,1))\n          Turn 77: D (change orientation to down)\n          Turn 78: S (stay, because the soup is not ready until turn 79)\n\n        Then at turn 79, Bob can do I to serve the soup (but that is beyond our plan).\n\n        But note: we have two players. We must output a sequence for Alice and optionally for Bob? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can output only for Alice? But the collaboration requires both.\n\n        Actually, the answer format is:\n\n          Turn t1: a_{t1}   (for Alice? or for both? The problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\")\n\n        The answer format doesn't specify for which player. But the action history is given separately for Alice and Bob, so we must specify the actions for both? The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for Alice and let Bob be controlled by someone else? But we are to optimize coordination.\n\n        However, the task is to output a sequence of actions for Alice and optionally for Bob. If we output only for Alice, then Bob's actions are not planned by us. But we are to maximize the reward, so we should plan for both.\n\n        But the answer format doesn't have a way to specify for which player. It just says \"a_t\". \n\n        Looking back: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" and then the answer format is a list of actions. How to assign to players?\n\n        I think we must assume that we are controlling both players? Or only Alice? The problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we are controlling Alice and Bob is a teammate. But we can plan for both? The problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we can also specify Bob's actions if we wish.\n\n        But the answer format is a single sequence of actions. How to differentiate?\n\n        I think we must output the actions for both players per turn? But the format doesn't say.\n\n        Let me read the answer format:\n\n          \\boxed{\n          Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n          Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n          ...\n          }\n\n        It doesn't specify player. So I think we are to output the actions for Alice? Because the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" and Bob is the teammate. But then how do we coordinate? We can only control Alice? \n\n        The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The word \"optionally\" suggests that we might only output for Alice and assume Bob will act independently? But that might not be optimal.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output a joint action? But the format doesn't have two actions per turn.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, I think we should assume that we are only controlling Alice. Bob will be controlled by his own policy (which we don't control). But we are to collaborate, so we can assume Bob will act optimally? Or we can infer from his action history?\n\n        However, the problem says: \"based on the current game state and action history of both players\". And we are to optimize coordination. So we should plan for Alice assuming that Bob will cooperate? But we don't know Bob's next actions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can plan for both and output two sequences? But the format doesn't allow.\n\n        Let me re-read: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The key is \"for Alice\", meaning we are to output Alice's actions. For Bob, we can either output his actions (optionally) or not. But the answer format is a single sequence of actions. So if we output Bob's actions, how?\n\n        I think the intended interpretation is that we output only Alice's actions. Bob is controlled by the environment (or by a fixed policy) and we must coordinate with him by our actions.\n\n        But then we cannot control Bob. So we must plan Alice's actions assuming Bob will continue his current task? Or we can signal Bob?\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem says \"optionally\", I will output only Alice's actions and hope that Bob will continue to get the plate and then serve. But to be safe, we should plan only for Alice.\n\n        However, the example above for Bob might not be what Bob does. So we must design Alice's actions to be robust? Or we can assume Bob is following a similar plan?\n\n        Since we don't control Bob, we can only control Alice. Therefore, we focus on Alice.\n\n        Revised plan for Alice only (assuming Bob will do his part as we hope):\n\n        We want Alice to complete the pot at (3,0). Then she can help with getting a plate? Or start the second pot.\n\n        But note: after putting the onion in the pot, Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing. She can then go to get a plate? Or get an onion for the second pot.\n\n        The plate dispenser is at (0,2). But Bob is already going there. We don't need two plates. So she can start working on the second pot.\n\n        How? She can get an onion from a counter and put it in the pot at (4,0).\n\n        Steps for Alice after turn 74 (after putting the onion in (3,0)):\n\n          Turn 75: ... she is at (3,1) facing down.\n\n          She can go to the pot at (4,0) to put an onion? But she doesn't have an onion.\n\n          There is an onion at (5,2) or (2,2) or (5,4) or (6,0). The closest? (2,2) is at (2,2) -> adjacent to (2,1) or (3,2) but (3,2) is a counter? (3,2) is a kitchen counter and has nothing? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counters: (5,2): onion, (5,4): onion, (6,0): onion, (2,2): onion, (4,2): onion (but we took the one at (4,2) already? In the state, it was listed as having an onion. But we took it? So now it is empty? \n\n          Actually, when we picked up the onion from (4,2) at turn 71, that counter becomes empty. So we cannot use it again until we put something.\n\n          So available onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2).\n\n          The closest to Alice at (3,1): (2,2) is at (2,2) -> distance: |3-2|+|1-2|=1+1=2. How to get:\n\n            From (3,1) to (2,2): \n              Move left to (2,1) [if empty] -> (2,1) is not in non-empty, so empty. Then up to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so we must stand adjacent and face it. So we can stand at (2,1) and face up? But (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) to the north.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Turn 75: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\n            Turn 76: U (change orientation to up) -> facing (2,2)\n            Turn 77: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\n          Then she can put it in the pot at (4,0). How?\n\n            From (2,1) to (4,0): \n              First, move right to (3,1) [empty] -> then down? (3,0) is a pot (non-empty) so we cannot walk on it. We must go via (3,1) to (4,1) and then to the pot at (4,0) by facing down.\n\n            Specifically:\n\n              Turn 78: R (move right to (3,1), facing right) -> but then she is at (3,1) facing right. The pot at (4,0) is southeast? Not adjacent. Then:\n\n              Turn 79: R (move right to (4,1), facing right) -> now adjacent to (4,0) to the south? Yes. Then:\n\n              Turn 80: D (change orientation to down) -> facing (4,0)\n              Turn 81: I (put onion)\n\n          But we are only planning until turn 78 (if H=10, then from 69 to 78). So we can only do until turn 78: at turn 77 she picks up the onion, then at turn 78 she moves to (3,1) (which is the same as after turn 72). \n\n        Alternatively, we can have her go to (5,2) which is closer? (5,2) is at (5,2). From (3,1) to (5,2): \n            (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) [if empty] -> then up to (5,2)? But (5,2) is a kitchen counter, so we must stand at (5,1) and face up.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Turn 75: R (to (4,1), facing right)\n          Turn 76: R (to (5,1), facing right)\n          Turn 77: U (change orientation to up) -> facing (5,2)\n          Turn 78: I (pick up onion)\n\n        Then she has the onion. Then next she can go to the pot at (4,0) in the following turns.\n\n        But at turn 78, she is at (5,1) holding an onion.\n\n        This is within 10 turns (from 69 to 78: 10 actions).\n\n        So let's do this.\n\n        Therefore, Alice's actions:\n\n          Turn 69: R\n          Turn 70: U\n          Turn 71: I\n          Turn 72: L\n          Turn 73: D\n          Turn 74: I\n          Turn 75: R\n          Turn 76: R\n          Turn 77: U\n          Turn 78: I\n\n        But note: at turn 74, she does I to put the onion in the pot. Then she is at (3,1) facing down. Then turn 75: R -> to (4,1) facing right. Then turn 76: R to (5,1) facing right. Then turn 77: U (change orientation to up) to face (5,2). Then turn 78: I to pick up the onion.\n\n        This is a valid plan.\n\n        However, we must consider if Bob is in the way? At turn 69, Bob is at (3,3). He moves left to (2,3) at turn 69, then to (1,3) at turn 70, then to (1,2) at turn 71. So by turn 71, Bob is at (1,2). Alice is at (4,1) at turn 70? \n\n          Turn 69: Alice moves R to (4,1); Bob moves L to (2,3)\n          Turn 70: Alice changes orientation to U; Bob moves L to (1,3)\n          Turn 71: Alice picks up onion (I) at (4,1) facing up; Bob moves D to (1,2)\n\n        Then turn 72: Alice moves L to (3,1); Bob changes orientation to L (left)\n        Turn 73: Alice changes orientation to D; Bob does I to grab plate? \n        Turn 74: Alice does I to put onion in pot; Bob moves D to (1,1)\n\n        Then turn 75: Alice moves R to (4,1); Bob moves R to (2,1)\n        Turn 76: Alice moves R to (5,1); Bob moves R to (3,1) -> but at turn 76, Bob moves to (3,1). Then at turn 76, Alice is moving to (5,1) and Bob to (3,1). Then turn 77: Alice changes orientation to U; Bob moves R to (4,1)? But Bob is at (3,1) and we planned for Bob to move to (3,1) at turn 76 and then at turn 77 change orientation to down? But we are not controlling Bob. So we don't know.\n\n        However, at turn 76, Alice is moving to (5,1) and Bob is moving to (3,1). They are not in the same tile? So no collision.\n\n        Then turn 77: Alice does U (orientation) at (5,1); Bob does D (orientation) at (3,1) -> no conflict.\n\n        Turn 78: Alice does I (pick up onion at (5,2)) at (5,1) facing up; Bob does S (stay) at (3,1) facing down.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But note: the kitchen counter at (5,2) had an onion initially? Yes, it was listed.\n\n        Therefore, we output Alice's actions for turns 69 to 78.\n\n        However, the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". Since we are only outputting Alice's, we do so.\n\n        Final plan for Alice:\n\n          Turn 69: R\n          Turn 70: U\n          Turn 71: I\n          Turn 72: L\n          Turn 73: D\n          Turn 74: I\n          Turn 75: R\n          Turn 76: R\n          Turn 77: U\n          Turn 78: I\n\n        This is 10 actions.\n\n        But note: at turn 78, Alice picks up an onion. Then in the next turns (beyond 78) she can put it in the pot at (4,0). But that is beyond our plan.\n\n        We hope that Bob will serve the first soup at turn 79.\n\n        This maximizes the reward in the near term: we get the first soup started and then get an onion for the second pot.\n\n        Alternatively, we could have Alice get a plate? But Bob is already getting one. So we don't need two plates.\n\n        So the plan is as above.\n\n        Let's write it in the answer format.\n\n        Note: we are at turn 69 (t1=69), and we are planning for 10 turns: 69 to 78.\n\n        \\boxed{\n        Turn 69: R\n        Turn 70: U\n        Turn 71: I\n        Turn 72: L\n        Turn 73: D\n        Turn 74: I\n        Turn 75: R\n        Turn 76: R\n        Turn 77: U\n        Turn 78: I\n        }\n\n        But note: the action at turn 74 is I (to put the onion in the pot) and then the pot starts cooking. The cooking will finish at turn 79, which is after our plan.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        We are done.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on completing the partially filled pot at (3,0) and preparing for the next soup. The pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and requires one more onion to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). Alice will retrieve an onion from the kitchen counter at (4,2), add it to the pot, then collect another onion from (5,2) for the empty pot at (4,0). This sets up two soups for future delivery. Bob, based on his action history and position, is likely fetching a plate from (0,2) to serve the first soup when ready. Alice's actions are optimized for efficiency and coordination.\n\n**Alice's Action Plan (10 turns):**\n\n- **Turn 69:** Move right (R) to (4,1), facing right.  \n- **Turn 70:** Change orientation up (U) to face the kitchen counter at (4,2).  \n- **Turn 71:** Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2).  \n- **Turn 72:** Move left (L) to (3,1), facing left.  \n- **Turn 73:** Change orientation down (D) to face the pot at (3,0).  \n- **Turn 74:** Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (3,0). The pot starts cooking (ready at turn 79).  \n- **Turn 75:** Move right (R) to (4,1), facing right.  \n- **Turn 76:** Move right (R) to (5,1), facing right.  \n- **Turn 77:** Change orientation up (U) to face the kitchen counter at (5,2).  \n- **Turn 78:** Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (5,2).  \n\n**Outcome:**  \n- The pot at (3,0) starts cooking at turn 74 and will be ready for serving at turn 79.  \n- Alice collects an onion for the next soup, enabling Bob (who is fetching a plate) to serve the first soup and Alice to start the second pot afterward.  \n- Total reward potential: 20 (first soup) + 20 (second soup) = 40, optimized within the planning horizon.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ R} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ L} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ D} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ R} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ R} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ I}\n\\end{aligned}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 72. Alice is at (4,1) facing right (R), holding nothing. Bob is at (3,3) facing down (D), holding nothing.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the reward by delivering soup. The only recipe we have is for 3 onions, which cooks in 5 turns and gives 20 reward.\n\nWe have two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). Currently, the pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and is not full (so cooking hasn't started). The other pot at (4,0) is empty.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). There is a plate dispenser at (0,2). The serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nAdditionally, there are several kitchen counters with onions already placed:\n- (5,2): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (6,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n\nWe note that there are many onions already on kitchen counters. This can be used to avoid going to the dispenser every time.\n\nThe pot at (3,0) only needs one more onion to start cooking. Since it takes 5 turns to cook, we want to get that third onion as soon as possible.\n\nAlice is at (4,1). She is one step above the pot at (4,0) and adjacent (to the right) of the pot at (3,0) but not facing it. However, note that to interact with a pot, she must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (4,1) facing right. The pot at (3,0) is to her left and down? Let's see the positions:\n- Alice: (4,1)\n- Pot (3,0): which is left (x-1) and down (y-1) from her? Actually, from (4,1) to (3,0) is left (x-1) and then down (y-1) but that's two steps. She is not adjacent to any pot at the moment.\n\nAdjacent means one step in one of the four directions. So from (4,1), the adjacent tiles are:\n- Left: (3,1)\n- Right: (5,1)\n- Up: (4,2)\n- Down: (4,0)\n\nThe pot at (3,0) is at (3,0) which is not adjacent to (4,1). The pot at (4,0) is adjacent to (4,1) because it is directly below her at (4,0). However, she is facing right, so not facing down.\n\nBob is at (3,3) facing down. The adjacent tiles to Bob are:\n- Left: (2,3)\n- Right: (4,3)\n- Up: (3,4) -> which is an onion dispenser\n- Down: (3,2) -> which is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\nSince the pot at (3,0) needs one more onion, we can have one of the players bring an onion to it. There are onions on the kitchen counters. The closest onion to the pot at (3,0) might be at (3,2) or (4,2) or (2,2) or (5,2). Also, (6,0) has an onion but that is near the serving area.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe need to get the third onion into the pot at (3,0) as soon as possible. Then the cooking will start. After 5 turns (from the turn the third onion is added), the soup will be ready. Then we need to get a plate and serve it.\n\nMeanwhile, we can also start filling the other pot at (4,0) for another soup.\n\nBut note: we are only planning for the next several turns (H turns). We don't know H, but we should aim for at least the first soup.\n\nLet's see who is closer to an onion and the pot.\n\nAlice is at (4,1). She can:\n- Move down to (4,0) to be next to the empty pot (4,0). But that pot is empty. Alternatively, she can move to get an onion from a nearby counter.\n\nThe closest onion on a counter to Alice is at (4,2) which is directly above her. So she can move up to (4,2) and pick up the onion? But note: to pick up from a kitchen counter, she must be adjacent and facing it. The counter is at (4,2). If she moves up to (4,2), she would be standing on the counter? But wait, the kitchen counters are walkable? Actually, the tile types say that kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note: the kitchen counter is a tile that can hold an item. However, the player can walk on it? Actually, the rules say:\n\n- \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n- \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\"\n\nBut the player can stand on a kitchen counter? The problem states: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and a kitchen counter is a tile that is non-empty only when it has an item? Or is it always non-empty? The description of the tile types doesn't explicitly say. However, the \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" list indicates that the counter is a tile that can be empty or occupied.\n\nI think we must assume that the kitchen counter tile is walkable when it doesn't have an item? But the problem says \"non-empty tile\" meaning a tile that is not of type \"Empty Tile\". Actually, the tile types are: Empty, Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter. So only Empty tiles are walkable? But then how do players interact with the others? They must be adjacent.\n\nLooking at the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning non-empty tiles (like dispensers, pots, counters) are not walkable. So players can only walk on empty tiles. Therefore, Alice at (4,1) cannot move to (4,2) because (4,2) is a kitchen counter and is non-empty? Actually, the kitchen counter at (4,2) is listed as non-empty because it has an onion. But even if it were empty, it is still a kitchen counter tile, which is not an empty tile? This is ambiguous.\n\nLet me re-read the rules:\n\n\"Game Grid (2D Tile Types)\" lists:\n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n- Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: these are non-empty tiles? The rules don't explicitly say, but the constraint says \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\", meaning they can only walk on empty tiles.\n\nSo, the player can only stand on empty tiles. Therefore, (4,2) is a kitchen counter tile, so not walkable. Alice cannot step on (4,2). She must be adjacent to it to interact.\n\nTherefore, Alice at (4,1) can interact with (4,2) only if she is facing up (because (4,2) is above her). But she is currently facing right. So she would need to change orientation to U and then interact.\n\nBut note: the interaction requires the player to be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing the target. (4,1) is an empty tile? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we know the positions of non-empty ones. The non-empty tiles are the ones listed (dispensers, pots, serving counter, and kitchen counters). So (4,1) is not in any of those lists? Then it must be an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) and (5,1) and (4,0) are not listed? So they are empty.\n\nBut (4,0) is a pot? The pot is at (3,0) and (4,0). So (4,0) is a pot tile, which is non-empty. Therefore, (4,0) is not walkable.\n\nSo for Alice at (4,1):\n- Down: (4,0) is a pot -> not walkable.\n- Up: (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> not walkable.\n- Left: (3,1) -> we don't have information, so likely empty? (since not in any non-empty list)\n- Right: (5,1) -> likely empty.\n\nSo Alice can move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1). But note that the pot at (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1) and (4,0) is adjacent to (4,1) but (4,0) is below her and she is at (4,1). She is adjacent to the pot at (4,0) because it is one step down? But she is at (4,1) and the pot is at (4,0): that is adjacent (down). But she is not on an empty tile adjacent to the pot? She is on (4,1) which is adjacent to (4,0). And (4,1) is an empty tile. So she can interact with the pot at (4,0) if she faces down.\n\nBut currently she is facing right. So if she changes orientation to down, then she can interact with the pot at (4,0). But the pot at (4,0) is empty. She has nothing to put in it.\n\nAlternatively, she can interact with the kitchen counter at (4,2) by facing up. But again, she is at (4,1) and (4,2) is above. So if she faces up, she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nSo Alice can do:\n- Change orientation to U (so she faces up towards the counter at (4,2)) and then interact to pick up the onion.\n\nBut note: she must be empty-handed to pick up. She is empty, so she can pick up the onion from (4,2).\n\nThen she can move to put that onion into a pot. The pot at (3,0) is close. From (4,1) with the onion, she can move left to (3,1) (if (3,1) is empty and walkable). Then at (3,1) she can face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). Then she can add the onion.\n\nBut the pot at (3,0) already has 2 onions. Adding the third will start the cooking.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might be closer to an onion and the pot. Bob is at (3,3) facing down. He is adjacent to (3,2) which is a kitchen counter with an onion. But he is facing down, so he is facing (3,2) because (3,2) is below (3,3). So he can interact to pick up the onion at (3,2). Then he can move to put it in the pot at (3,0). How? He can move down to (3,2) but that is not walkable because it's a kitchen counter? Or can he? The rules say players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty, so he cannot step on it. Therefore, he must pick it up from (3,3) by facing down and interacting. Then he has the onion.\n\nThen he can move to (3,2)? No, because (3,2) is non-empty. He must go around? The adjacent tiles to (3,3) are:\n- Left: (2,3) -> if empty, he can go there.\n- Right: (4,3) -> if empty, he can go there.\n- Up: (3,4) -> onion dispenser, non-empty, so cannot go there.\n- Down: (3,2) -> non-empty, cannot go.\n\nSo from (3,3) holding an onion, he can only move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3). Then from there, he can go down to (2,2) or (4,2) but note (2,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters with onions? They are non-empty, so he cannot step on them. Then how to get to the pot at (3,0)? He must go through (3,2) but that's blocked? Alternatively, he can go down to (2,2) or (4,2) but again, cannot step. This is a problem.\n\nActually, the pot at (3,0) is at (3,0). How can Bob get to a tile adjacent to the pot? The adjacent tiles to the pot at (3,0) are:\n- Up: (3,1)\n- Right: (4,0) -> which is another pot, non-empty? But (4,0) is a pot, so non-empty and not walkable.\n- Left: (2,0) -> which is a kitchen counter? The list of kitchen counters includes (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), etc. So (2,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n- Down: not applicable? The pot is at (3,0), so down would be (3,-1) which is out of bounds.\n\nSo the only adjacent tile to the pot at (3,0) is (3,1). Therefore, Bob must get to (3,1) to interact with the pot.\n\nHow can Bob get to (3,1)? He is at (3,3). He can move:\n- Left to (2,3) -> if empty.\n- Then down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-empty, cannot step.\n- Then down to (2,1) -> if empty, then left? But (2,1) is not listed as non-empty, so probably empty. Then from (2,1) he can move right to (3,1) -> if empty.\n\nSo the path for Bob: \n- From (3,3) move left to (2,3) [assuming (2,3) is empty].\n- Then down to (2,2) -> but cannot, because non-empty? So he must avoid (2,2). Instead, from (2,3) move down to (2,2) is blocked. Then he must go down to (2,1) by moving down twice? But from (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked, so he cannot. Alternatively, move right to (3,3) again? Not helpful.\n\nAnother path: \n- From (3,3) move right to (4,3) [if empty].\n- Then down to (4,2) -> blocked (kitchen counter with onion).\n- Then down to (4,1) -> which is where Alice is? But we don't know if (4,1) is occupied by Alice? At the moment, Alice is at (4,1). But if Alice moves away, then (4,1) becomes free.\n\nBut we are planning for both, so we can coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can pick up the onion at (3,2) by interacting from (3,3) facing down. Then he is holding an onion. Then he can move left to (2,3) and then down to (2,2) is blocked, so he must go down to (2,1) by going: from (2,3) move down to (2,2) is not allowed, so he must go around? The map is:\n\nWe know the non-empty tiles, but not the full grid. We must assume that any tile not listed as non-empty is empty and walkable, except that we have to avoid the player positions.\n\nSo the grid is 8x5? From the tile list, we have x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 4? The kitchen counters go up to (7,4).\n\nSo let's sketch the grid:\n\nRow y=4: kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) and onion dispensers at (3,4), (4,4). So the entire row y=4 is non-empty? Then Bob cannot step on any of these.\n\nRow y=3: kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3). So the rest (1,3) to (6,3) are empty? Bob is at (3,3) which is in row y=3, and we don't have any non-empty at (3,3), so it's empty. Then (2,3) and (4,3) are likely empty.\n\nRow y=2: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) and plate dispenser at (0,2). Also serving counter at (7,2). So (1,2) and (6,2) might be empty? But we don't have information. Let's assume they are empty.\n\nRow y=1: no non-empty tiles listed? So all are empty? Alice is at (4,1) which is empty.\n\nRow y=0: kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) and pots at (3,0), (4,0). So (0,0) to (2,0) are counters, (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, (5,0) and (6,0) and (7,0) are counters. So no empty tiles in row y=0.\n\nTherefore, the only adjacent tile to the pot at (3,0) is (3,1). Similarly, for the pot at (4,0), adjacent tile is (4,1).\n\nNow for Bob to get to (3,1) from (3,3):\n- He must go through (3,2) but (3,2) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-empty, so blocked. Therefore, Bob cannot get to (3,1) directly from above because (3,2) is blocking.\n\nHe must go around. The only way is to go left to (2,3) then down to (2,2) is blocked, so he must go down to (2,1) then right to (3,1). Similarly, the right side: (4,2) is blocked, so he can go to (4,3) then down to (4,2) blocked, then he must go to (4,1) via (4,3) -> (4,2) blocked, so he cannot? Alternatively, from (4,3) he can go down to (4,2) is blocked, so he must go to (5,3) or (3,3) again? This is messy.\n\nActually, from (3,3) Bob can move left to (2,3). Then from (2,3) move down to (2,2) is blocked. Then he can move down to (2,1) only if there is a path? But from (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked, so he cannot go down. Similarly, he can move right to (3,3) again. So he is stuck on the top row? But there is row y=3 and y=4. He can move left to (1,3) then down to (1,2) if (1,2) is empty? But we don't have information about (1,2). The kitchen counters in row y=2 are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) and (0,2) is plate dispenser. So (1,2) is not listed, so it must be empty. Similarly, (6,2) is empty? And (7,2) is serving counter.\n\nSo Bob can go:\n- From (3,3) move left to (2,3) -> empty.\n- Then left to (1,3) -> empty.\n- Then down to (1,2) -> empty.\n- Then down to (1,1) -> empty? (assuming).\n- Then right to (2,1) -> empty.\n- Then right to (3,1) -> empty.\n\nThat's 5 moves just to get to (3,1). Then he can interact with the pot. This is too long.\n\nAlternatively, Alice is closer to the pot. Alice is at (4,1). She can pick up the onion from the counter at (4,2) by facing up and interacting. Then she can move left to (3,1) and then face down to interact with the pot at (3,0) and add the onion.\n\nSteps for Alice:\n1. Change orientation to U (to face up) and then Interact to pick up onion from (4,2). That takes 2 turns: first change orientation, then interact.\n   - Turn 72: U (change orientation to up) -> now she is at (4,1) facing up.\n   - Turn 73: I -> picks up onion from (4,2). Now she holds an onion.\n\n2. Then move left to (3,1). That's one move: L at turn 74.\n\n3. Then change orientation to D (to face down) because the pot is at (3,0) which is below (3,1). Then interact to put the onion in the pot. That's two more turns: turn 75: change to D, turn 76: I.\n\nSo by turn 76, the pot at (3,0) gets the third onion and cooking starts.\n\nBut note: at turn 76, the cooking starts. Then it will be ready at turn 76 + 5 = turn 81.\n\nMeanwhile, we can have Bob start getting a plate. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (3,3). He can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath for Bob to plate dispenser:\n- Bob at (3,3). He can move left to (2,3) -> turn 72.\n- Then left to (1,3) -> turn 73.\n- Then left to (0,3) -> but (0,3) is a kitchen counter? The list says kitchen counter at (0,3) -> non-empty, so cannot walk. So he must go down from (1,3) to (1,2) -> empty, turn 74.\n- Then left to (0,2) -> but (0,2) is a plate dispenser, non-empty, so he cannot step on it. He must be adjacent and facing it to interact. So he should go to (0,1) or (1,2) and face the dispenser.\n\nActually, (0,2) is at the top of the grid? The adjacent tiles are:\n- Down: (0,1) -> if empty.\n- Right: (1,2) -> empty.\n\nSo Bob can go to (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2). Or go to (0,1) and face up.\n\nBut (0,1) is not listed as non-empty, so empty. So:\n\nBob's plan:\n- Turn 72: L -> to (2,3)\n- Turn 73: L -> to (1,3)\n- Turn 74: D -> to (1,2)\n- Turn 75: change orientation to L (to face left towards (0,2))\n- Turn 76: I -> grab a plate.\n\nThen he holds a plate. Then he must deliver the soup when it's ready. The soup will be ready at turn 81. But he is at (1,2) and the serving counter is at (7,2). He must go to (7,2) but that is the serving counter, non-empty, so he must be adjacent. The adjacent tile to (7,2) is (7,1) or (7,3) or (6,2). (7,3) is a kitchen counter, non-empty. (7,1) is not listed? So probably empty. (6,2) is not listed? But row y=2 has kitchen counters at (2,2) to (5,2) and (0,2) dispenser, (7,2) serving. So (6,2) should be empty? Actually, the kitchen counters at (5,2) and (6,0) etc. but (6,2) is not listed, so empty.\n\nSo Bob can go to (6,2) and face right to serve? Or (7,1) and face up? Or (7,3) is blocked.\n\nBut the soup is not ready until turn 81. So he has time to move.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob do something else while waiting for the soup to cook.\n\nBut note: we are only planning for several turns (say H turns). We don't know H, but we can plan until the soup is delivered? Or until we have set up for the delivery.\n\nSince the cooking takes 5 turns, we can plan for about 10 turns.\n\nAfter Alice puts the onion in the pot at turn 76, she can start working on the other pot at (4,0). She is at (3,1) after putting the onion. She can move right to (4,1) and then face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). But she is empty-handed? She just put the onion. So she needs to get another onion.\n\nThere are onions at kitchen counters: (3,2) is above (3,1). She can face up and interact to pick up the onion at (3,2). Then she can put it in the pot at (4,0) by moving to (4,1) and facing down.\n\nBut (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2) above. So:\n- After turn 76, Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n- Turn 77: change orientation to U (to face up) and then interact to pick up onion from (3,2) at turn 78.\n- Then turn 79: move right to (4,1)\n- Turn 80: change orientation to D (facing down) to the pot at (4,0)\n- Turn 81: interact to put the onion -> but the pot at (4,0) is empty, so now it has one onion.\n\nMeanwhile, the soup at (3,0) is ready at turn 81. Bob is holding a plate and can serve it.\n\nBut Bob is at (1,2) after getting the plate at turn 76. He must go to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup? No, to serve the soup from the pot, he must be adjacent to the pot and holding a plate. Then he can interact to put the plate in the pot and get the soup. Then he can deliver it.\n\nSo Bob's plan after turn 76:\n- He is at (1,2) holding a plate.\n- He needs to go to (3,1) to serve the soup from pot (3,0). But (3,1) is currently occupied by Alice? At turn 76, Alice is at (3,1). Then Alice moves to (4,1) at turn 79. So at turn 76, Alice is at (3,1). Bob cannot be at the same tile.\n\nSo Bob must wait until Alice moves. Or they must coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to the serving counter directly? But he doesn't have the soup yet. He must first get the soup from the pot.\n\nSo Bob must interact with the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup (i.e., put the plate in and get the soup). Then he can deliver.\n\nBut to interact with the pot at (3,0), he must be at (3,1) and facing down. So he must go to (3,1). But Alice is at (3,1) until at least turn 79. So:\n\n- Turn 76: Bob is at (1,2) holding plate.\n- Turn 77: Bob moves right to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-empty, cannot walk. So he must go around? He can move down to (1,1) then right to (2,1) then to (3,1). But (1,1) and (2,1) are not listed, so empty.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 77: Bob moves down to (1,1) [if (1,1) is empty] -> move D? But he is at (1,2), so down would be (1,1). Orientation doesn't matter for movement? The move action changes position and orientation? The rules say: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if he moves down, he goes to (1,1) and faces down.\n\n- Turn 78: Bob moves right to (2,1)\n- Turn 79: Bob moves right to (3,1) -> but at turn 79, Alice is moving from (3,1) to (4,1). So at turn 79, Alice moves to (4,1) and Bob moves to (3,1) in the same turn? That is possible? The rules don't say players cannot be on the same tile? Actually, the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So they cannot occupy the same tile. Therefore, Bob cannot move to (3,1) if Alice is there.\n\nSo at turn 79, Alice is moving from (3,1) to (4,1). So at the beginning of turn 79, Alice is at (3,1). Bob is at (2,1). Bob wants to move to (3,1). But Alice is leaving (3,1) at turn 79 by moving right. So after Alice moves, (3,1) is free. But in the same turn, Bob moves to (3,1)? The actions are simultaneous? Or sequential? The problem doesn't specify. In Overcooked, players move simultaneously. But in this planning, we are assigning actions for both.\n\nIn the answer format, we are to plan for Alice. Optionally for Bob? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both.\n\nBut the output format only shows one player? The answer format only has one set of turns. It says \"for Alice\". So we are only to output Alice's actions? And Bob is controlled by someone else? The task says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", but then \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". Since the output format only has one set, I think we are to output only Alice's actions and assume Bob is following a coordinated plan? But we don't output Bob's.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume that we control both? But the output format is for one player. The task says \"for Alice\".\n\nRe-reading: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice\"\n\nSo we only output Alice's actions.\n\nThen we must assume that Bob is following a reasonable plan? Or we coordinate by assuming Bob will do what we intend? But that might not be safe.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on Alice.\n\nAlice's actions to complete the first soup:\n\n- Turn 72: Change orientation to U (to face the counter at (4,2))\n- Turn 73: Interact to pick up the onion from (4,2)\n- Turn 74: Move left to (3,1)\n- Turn 75: Change orientation to D (to face the pot at (3,0))\n- Turn 76: Interact to put the onion into the pot -> now the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts.\n\nThen Alice can start working on the next soup. She is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\n- Turn 77: Change orientation to U (to face the counter at (3,2) which has an onion)\n- Turn 78: Interact to pick up the onion from (3,2)\n- Turn 79: Move right to (4,1)\n- Turn 80: Change orientation to D (to face the pot at (4,0))\n- Turn 81: Interact to put the onion into the pot at (4,0) -> now that pot has 1 onion.\n\nMeanwhile, the soup at (3,0) is ready at turn 81. But we need to deliver it. Bob should be getting the plate and serving. But we don't control Bob.\n\nTo maximize, we can have Alice, after turn 81, go get a plate? But that is far.\n\nAlternatively, after putting the onion in the second pot, Alice can help with the delivery.\n\nBut let's see: at turn 81, Alice has put one onion in the second pot. She is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can get another onion for the second pot.\n\nBut the delivery is important.\n\nGiven that we only output for Alice, and we plan for H turns, let's set H=10 (from turn 72 to 81). But turn 72 is the current turn? We start at t1=72, so we plan for t=72,73,..., up to H-1? The sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1? The notation is \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\), so t=1 to H-1, meaning actions for t1+1 to t1+H-1? That doesn't include t1.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\)\" so it starts at t1+1 and goes for H-1 actions? That seems odd. Or is it from t1 to t1+H-1?\n\nLooking: \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\" and the sequence is for t1 to t1+H-1? But the indexing is a_{t1+t} for t=1 to H-1? Then it would be from t1+1 to t1+H-1, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the current turn is t1=72. We are to plan starting from turn 72? Or from turn 73?\n\nThe action history is given for the past turns, and we are at turn 72. So we need to output the actions for the next turns, starting at turn 72.\n\nThe answer format says:\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n\nSo we start at t1.\n\nTherefore, we output actions for turn 72, 73, ... up to some H.\n\nWe'll output for 10 turns: until turn 81.\n\nSo for Alice:\n- Turn 72: U (change orientation to up)\n- Turn 73: I (interact with (4,2) to pick up onion)\n- Turn 74: L (move left to (3,1))\n- Turn 75: D (change orientation to down)\n- Turn 76: I (interact with pot (3,0) to add onion -> cooking starts)\n- Turn 77: U (change orientation to up to face (3,2))\n- Turn 78: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n- Turn 79: R (move right to (4,1))\n- Turn 80: D (change orientation to down to face pot (4,0))\n- Turn 81: I (add onion to pot (4,0))\n\nBut at turn 81, the soup at (3,0) is ready. But Alice is not holding a plate. Bob should be doing that.\n\nWe assume Bob is getting the plate and serving. But since we don't control Bob, we focus on Alice.\n\nAlternatively, after the first soup is started, Alice could get a plate and be ready to serve. But she is at (3,1) at turn 76. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). It's far. Bob is closer.\n\nTo be safe, we continue with filling the second pot.\n\nBut note: the second pot has only one onion. We need two more. There are many onions on counters, so Alice can continue.\n\nAfter turn 81, Alice can get another onion. For example, she can pick up from (4,2) again? But we picked the onion at (4,2) at turn 73. The counter is now empty? Or does it replenish? The problem doesn't say. The dispensers are sources, but the kitchen counters: when you pick up, it's gone. So (4,2) is empty after turn 73. Similarly, (3,2) is empty after turn 78.\n\nBut there are other onions: (2,2), (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (5,4) is at (5,4) which is far.\n\nThe closest might be (5,2) or (2,2). But Alice is at (4,1) at turn 81.\n\nShe can move to (5,1) then face up to pick up from (5,2) if it has an onion. But (5,2) does have an onion initially.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 82: R to (5,1)\n- Turn 83: U to face up? But she is moving to (5,1) and facing? The move action changes orientation. When she moves right to (5,1), she faces right. Then she needs to change orientation to up to face (5,2). Then interact.\n\nBut this is beyond 10 turns.\n\nGiven the complexity and that we only control Alice, we'll output the 10 turns as above.\n\nBut let's check if the positions are walkable and interactions valid.\n\nFor Alice:\n- Start: (4,1) facing R.\n- Turn 72: U -> change orientation to up. Now at (4,1) facing U.\n- Turn 73: I -> interact with (4,2) which is above. (4,2) is a kitchen counter with onion. She is empty, so she picks up the onion. Now holding onion.\n- Turn 74: L -> move left to (3,1). Now at (3,1) facing left? The move action changes orientation: when she moves left, she faces left. But we don't care as long as we can interact later.\n- Turn 75: D -> change orientation to down. Now facing down.\n- Turn 76: I -> interact with pot (3,0) which is below. She adds the onion. Now the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts. She is empty.\n- Turn 77: U -> change orientation to up. Facing up.\n- Turn 78: I -> interact with (3,2) which is above. (3,2) has an onion, so she picks it up. Holding onion.\n- Turn 79: R -> move right to (4,1). Now at (4,1) facing right.\n- Turn 80: D -> change orientation to down. Facing down.\n- Turn 81: I -> interact with pot (4,0) below. She adds the onion. Now pot (4,0) has one onion. She is empty.\n\nThis is valid.\n\nWe assume Bob will handle the plate and delivery for the first soup.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice from turn 72 to 81:\n\nTurn 72: U  \nTurn 73: I  \nTurn 74: L  \nTurn 75: D  \nTurn 76: I  \nTurn 77: U  \nTurn 78: I  \nTurn 79: R  \nTurn 80: D  \nTurn 81: I\n\nBut the task says to output in the box.\n\nNote: the move actions change position and orientation. The change orientation actions only change orientation if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? The rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\nWait, that is confusing. The rule: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nIt says \"no move\", meaning the player does not move, but does the orientation change? The rule doesn't say. It should be that the orientation changes regardless, because it's a change orientation action. But the condition \"if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" seems misplaced. Let me read:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means that if you try to move in that direction and the tile is not empty, then you don't move (and presumably the orientation changes). But the move action is separate. The change orientation action should only change orientation and not move. The rule might be misstated.\n\nLooking back: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. But typically in such games, change orientation doesn't move. So I think the rule means: when you choose a change orientation action, it only changes orientation and never moves, regardless of adjacent tiles. The \"no move\" might be redundant.\n\nI think we can assume that change orientation always changes orientation and never moves.\n\nSo in our plan, when Alice does U (change orientation) at turn 72, she changes to face up, and no move.\n\nSimilarly for turn 75, 77, 80.\n\nTherefore, the plan is valid.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{L} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{D} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{R} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{D} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 81: \\text{I}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\nBut the format in the box should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: I \\\\\nTurn 74: L \\\\\nTurn 75: D \\\\\nTurn 76: I \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: I \\\\\nTurn 79: R \\\\\nTurn 80: D \\\\\nTurn 81: I\n}\n\nWe can stop at turn 81, which is 10 turns from 72? From 72 to 81 inclusive is 10 actions.\n\nNote: turn 72 is the first action we plan.\n\nThis plan gets the first soup started and adds one onion to the second pot.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob must coordinate efficiently. The current state shows a pot at (3,0) with 2 onions, requiring one more onion to start cooking a soup that yields a 20-reward after 5 turns. Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing, and Bob is at (3,3) holding nothing. The plan focuses on Alice completing the first soup by adding the third onion to the pot at (3,0), then starting the second soup at (4,0). Bob is assumed to handle plate retrieval and serving independently, as coordination is optimized through Alice's actions.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 72 to 81)\n- **Turn 72 (U)**: Change orientation to up to face the kitchen counter at (4,2), which holds an onion. This prepares for interaction.\n- **Turn 73 (I)**: Interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion. Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 74 (L)**: Move left to (3,1), positioning adjacent to the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turn 75 (D)**: Change orientation to down to face the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turn 76 (I)**: Interact with (3,0) to add the onion. The pot now has 3 onions, and cooking starts (will finish at turn 81).\n- **Turn 77 (U)**: Change orientation to up to face the kitchen counter at (3,2), which holds an onion.\n- **Turn 78 (I)**: Interact with (3,2) to pick up the onion. Alice now holds an onion for the second pot.\n- **Turn 79 (R)**: Move right to (4,1), positioning adjacent to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 80 (D)**: Change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 81 (I)**: Interact with (4,0) to add the onion. The pot now has 1 onion, initiating the second soup.\n\n### Coordination and Optimization\n- **First Soup Completion**: By turn 76, Alice adds the third onion to (3,0). Cooking starts, and the soup will be ready at turn 81. Bob (not controlled here) should retrieve a plate from (0,2) and serve the soup at (3,0) by turn 81, delivering for 20 reward.\n- **Second Soup Initiation**: Alice uses nearby onions on counters (e.g., (4,2) and (3,2)) to efficiently start the second soup at (4,0) by turn 81.\n- **Efficiency**: Alice leverages her proximity to ingredients and pots, minimizing movement. The plan avoids conflicts with Bob, who is farther from (3,0) and can focus on plates and serving.\n- **Total Rewards**: One soup delivered by turn 81 (20 reward), with a second soup started for future rewards. Planning horizon (10 turns) covers critical setup phases.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{L} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{D} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{I} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{R} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{D} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 81: \\text{I}\n\\end{aligned}\n}",

The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\n## Environment Details:\n- **Kitchen Counters** (for temporary storage): \n  - (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n- **Onion Dispensers**: (3,4) and (4,4)\n- **Plate Dispenser**: (0,2)\n- **Pots**: (3,0) and (4,0)\n- **Serving Counter**: (7,2)\n\n## Recipe Information:\n- Only one recipe: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\n## Current Game State:\n- **Alice (you)**:\n  - Position: (4,1)\n  - Orientation: Up (U)\n  - Holding: one onion\n  - Action History (most recent last): I, R, U, I, U\n    - Interpretation: \n      - The most recent action was U (move up). Before that, I (interact), then U (move up?), then R (move right?), then I (interact). \n      - But note: Alice is at (4,1) and holding an onion. The actions might have led to picking up an onion.\n\n- **Bob**:\n  - Position: (3,3)\n  - Orientation: Up (U)\n  - Holding: nothing\n  - Action History: D, I, L, R, U (most recent last: U)\n\n## Non-empty Kitchen Counters (with items):\n- (5,2): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (6,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n\n## Pot State:\n- Pot at (3,0): contains 2 onions and 0 tomatoes; not full (so cooking hasn't started). It needs one more onion to start cooking.\n\n## Objective:\nWe want to deliver as many soups as possible to the serving counter (7,2). The recipe requires 3 onions and cooks in 5 turns.\n\n## Analysis:\nThe pot at (3,0) already has 2 onions. We need to add one more onion to start cooking. Then after 5 turns, the soup will be ready. Then we need to serve it by using a plate and then delivering to the serving counter.\n\nAlice is holding an onion at (4,1). She can potentially add that onion to the pot at (3,0) if she moves to a position adjacent to (3,0) and faces it.\n\nBob is at (3,3) holding nothing. He can help by getting a plate or an onion.\n\n### Steps to complete one soup at (3,0):\n1. Add the third onion to the pot at (3,0) to start cooking. (Alice can do this soon because she has an onion and is near (3,0).)\n2. Wait 5 turns for cooking (turn 76 to 80).\n3. After cooking is done (at turn 81), someone must get a plate, then use it on the pot to get the soup, then deliver to (7,2).\n\n### Considerations for multiple soups:\nThere is another pot at (4,0). We can also make a second soup. However, we need 3 onions for that. There are onions available on kitchen counters and at dispensers.\n\nBut note: we are only planning for the next several turns (say H turns). Let's set H to 10? But the soup cooking takes 5 turns, so we might not see the delivery within 10 turns? However, we can plan the start of the cooking and then the serving.\n\nBut the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We are not fixed on H, but we must output a sequence. Since the cooking takes 5 turns, we can plan for about 10 turns to see the first delivery.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan the next steps to set up for multiple soups.\n\nBut note: the recipe is fixed (only one recipe: 3 onions). So we can only make onion soups.\n\n## Current Resources:\n- Onions: \n  - Alice has one.\n  - Kitchen counters: 5 onions (at (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2))\n  - Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) (so we can get more).\n\n## Plan:\n\n### Immediate actions for Alice:\nAlice is at (4,1) holding an onion. The pot at (3,0) is at (3,0). To interact with (3,0), she must be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent positions to (3,0) are: (3,1) [below], (2,0) [left], (4,0) [right], (3,-1) [not exist] so only (3,1) from above? Actually, (3,0) is at the bottom row. So adjacent are (2,0), (4,0), and (3,1). But note the grid: \n- (3,0) is a pot. \n- Alice is at (4,1). She is above (4,0). \n\nTo get to (3,1) (which is adjacent to (3,0) from above), she can:\n  - Move left to (3,1) [from (4,1): move L to (3,1)] and then face down (D) to interact with (3,0). \nBut note: (3,1) is a kitchen counter? Check: (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are listed and (3,1) is not there -> so it's an empty tile? Therefore, she can move to (3,1) and then face down to interact.\n\nAlternatively, she could go to (4,0) but (4,0) is a pot tile? No, the pot is at (3,0) and (4,0) is also a pot? The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). So (4,0) is a pot tile -> non-empty, so she cannot walk on it.\n\nTherefore, the only adjacent empty tile to (3,0) that is accessible is (3,1) (above) and (2,0) and (4,0) are pots? Actually, (2,0) is a kitchen counter (because (2,0) is in the kitchen counter list). Similarly, (4,0) is a pot -> non-empty. So the only adjacent empty tile is (3,1).\n\nSo Alice:\n- Step 1: Move left from (4,1) to (3,1) (action L). Then she is at (3,1).\n- Step 2: Change orientation to down (D) to face (3,0). But note: the action for changing orientation is one of {U, D, L, R} but without moving? Actually, the action set: \n  - Move actions (L/R/U/D): change position and orientation to that direction.\n  - Change orientation: by trying to move in that direction but if the adjacent tile is not empty, then it only changes orientation? But the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" So if she is at (3,1) and does D (which is down), then the adjacent tile (3,0) is a pot (non-empty) -> so she doesn't move and only changes orientation to down.\n\nBut note: the action for changing orientation is the same as move? Actually, the actions are the same set. So if she does D at (3,1), since the tile below (3,0) is non-empty, she won't move and will only change orientation to D.\n\nThen she can interact (I) with the pot (3,0) because she is at (3,1) and facing down (towards (3,0)).\n\nSo for Alice at turn 75: \n  - Turn 75: L (move left to (3,1))\n  - Turn 76: D (change orientation to down without moving, because (3,0) is non-empty)\n  - Turn 77: I (interact: add the onion to the pot at (3,0))\n\nAfter adding, the pot at (3,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking at turn 77. It will be ready at turn 77 + 5 = turn 82.\n\n### What about Bob?\nBob is at (3,3) holding nothing. He can help by getting a plate or gathering onions for the next soup.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). But we also have onions on kitchen counters that can be used for the next soup.\n\nWe have two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). We are starting one soup at (3,0). We can start another at (4,0). \n\nBut note: we are at turn 75. The first soup will be ready at turn 82. We can plan to have the second soup started as well.\n\nHowever, let's focus on the immediate next steps for both.\n\nBob at (3,3): \n  - He can move to get an onion from a dispenser or from a kitchen counter? But we need to start the second soup.\n\nAlternatively, he can get a plate so that when the soup is ready, we can serve quickly.\n\nBut the plate dispenser is at (0,2). It's far. Alternatively, we can use the plate later? But we have 5 turns of cooking. So we can get the plate during the cooking time.\n\nBut note: we have many onions on kitchen counters. We can use those to start the second soup at (4,0).\n\nPlan for Bob:\n- Bob can go to a kitchen counter that has an onion, pick it up, and then bring it to the pot at (4,0). But note: he is at (3,3). The closest onion on a counter is at (3,2) or (2,2) or (5,2)? \n\nThe kitchen counters with onions:\n  - (5,2): onion\n  - (5,4): onion\n  - (6,0): onion -> far\n  - (2,2): onion\n  - (3,2): onion\n\n(3,2) is directly above Bob? Bob is at (3,3). So (3,2) is one step above? But Bob is facing up. So he can move up to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty? Actually, kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? No, the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and they are non-empty only if they have an item. But the tile itself is walkable? \n\nThe problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But a kitchen counter is a tile that can be empty or occupied. If it is occupied (has an item), then it is non-empty? Or is the tile type always non-walkable? \n\nThe tile types: \n  - Empty Tile: walkable.\n  - Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: these are non-empty tiles? But note: the problem says \"non-empty\" in the context of having an item. However, the movement rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that are not empty? \n\nBut the Kitchen Counter tile is a type of tile that is not empty? Actually, the game grid lists the tile types. The kitchen counter is a type of tile. The problem does not explicitly say that kitchen counters are walkable. But typically in Overcooked, counters are not walkable. \n\nLooking at the problem: \n  - \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n  - Other tiles (Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter) are not empty tiles -> so they are non-empty and non-walkable? \n\nBut then how do players interact? They must be adjacent. \n\nTherefore, Bob at (3,3) cannot walk onto (3,2) because it's a kitchen counter (non-walkable). He must be adjacent to interact. So he can stand next to (3,2) and face it to interact. \n\nAdjacent positions to (3,2) that are walkable? \n  - (3,1): is it empty? \n    - Check: (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are listed and (3,1) is not there -> so it's an empty tile? \n  - (2,2): is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n  - (4,2): is a kitchen counter (in the list) -> non-walkable.\n  - (3,3): is where Bob is.\n\nSo Bob can stand at (3,1) and face up to interact with (3,2)? But (3,2) is above (3,1). Or he can stand at (2,2) but that's non-walkable? Actually, he cannot stand on (2,2) because it's non-walkable.\n\nAlternatively, he can stand at (3,3) and face up to interact with (3,2)? The problem says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nBob is at (3,3). The tile (3,2) is adjacent? Yes, because (3,3) is below (3,2). And (3,2) is non-empty (because it has an onion). So if Bob is facing up (which he is, because his orientation is U) and at (3,3) (adjacent to (3,2) from below), then he can interact to pick up the onion? \n\nBut note: (3,2) is a kitchen counter. The interact rule for kitchen counter: \"Pick up items (if player is empty-handed and counter is occupied)\". Bob is empty-handed and the counter is occupied (has onion). So he can pick it up.\n\nSo Bob can do:\n  - Turn 75: I (interact) to pick up the onion from (3,2) without moving.\n\nThen he will be holding an onion.\n\nNow, what to do with that onion? We have two pots: \n  - (3,0) is about to get the third onion from Alice (at turn 77). \n  - (4,0) is empty? Currently, the pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and (4,0) is not mentioned -> so it has 0. We can start a second soup at (4,0). \n\nBob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He can go to (4,0) to add the onion? But (4,0) is a pot. He must be adjacent. The adjacent empty tile to (4,0) is (4,1) and (3,0) (which is a pot -> non-walkable) and (5,0) (kitchen counter -> non-walkable). \n\n(4,1) is currently occupied by Alice? At turn 75, Alice is at (4,1). But Alice will move to (3,1) at turn 75. So after turn 75, Alice will be at (3,1). Then (4,1) becomes empty.\n\nSo Bob can:\n  - After picking up the onion at turn 75, he can move down? But he is at (3,3). To get to (4,0), he needs to go to (4,1) first. \n  - Turn 75: Bob does I (interact) to pick up onion at (3,2) -> now holding onion.\n  - Then he needs to go to (4,1). From (3,3), he can move right to (4,3) -> but then down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (4,2) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-walkable. \n  - Alternative: from (3,3) move down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is non-walkable. So he cannot move down. \n  - Then move right to (4,3) -> then down to (4,2) -> non-walkable. \n  - Then move down to (3,2) -> non-walkable. \n\nWait, Bob is at (3,3). He can only move in directions to empty tiles. \n  - Left: (2,3) -> is that walkable? \n    - Check: (2,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The list: ... (0,3), (7,3) -> so (2,3) is not listed -> empty tile? \n  - Right: (4,3) -> not in the kitchen counter list? The list: ... (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) -> (4,3) not listed -> empty tile.\n  - Down: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n  - Up: (3,4) -> is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3). \n\nTo get to (4,1), the best is to go right to (4,3) and then down? But from (4,3), down to (4,2) is non-walkable. Then how to get to (4,1)? \n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? No, because (4,2) is non-walkable. Then he must go around? \n  - From (4,3), move right? (5,3) -> is it walkable? (5,3) is not in the kitchen counter list -> empty. Then from (5,3) move down to (5,2)? But (5,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n  - Alternatively, from (4,3) move left? But that would be (3,3) again.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) move left to (2,3). Then from (2,3) move down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. Then move down to (2,1)? \n  - (2,1): not in kitchen counter list -> empty? \n  - Then from (2,1) move right to (3,1) -> but at turn 75, Alice is moving to (3,1) so at turn 75 Bob cannot go to (3,1) because Alice will be there? But we are planning for multiple turns.\n\nActually, we are planning for both players. We must avoid collisions.\n\nAlternative plan for Bob: after picking up the onion at (3,2) at turn 75, he can go to the pot at (4,0) via (3,1) but that might be occupied by Alice. \n\nBut note: \n  - Turn 75: \n      Alice: L (to (3,1))\n      Bob: I (interact to pick up onion at (3,2))\n  - Then at turn 76:\n      Alice: D (change orientation to down at (3,1))\n      Bob: ... now Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He wants to go to (4,1). How?\n\nBob can move right to (4,3) at turn 76. Then at turn 77, Alice will do I (interact) and then move away? But we need to get Bob to (4,1) to interact with the pot at (4,0). \n\nAt turn 77, Alice is at (3,1) and will interact (I) and then be free. Then at turn 78, Alice can move away to let Bob use (3,1) or Bob can go to (4,1) if it's free? \n\nBut note: after Alice interacts at turn 77, she is still at (3,1). Then Bob can go to (4,1) by:\n  - Turn 76: Bob moves right to (4,3)\n  - Turn 77: Bob moves down? cannot because (4,2) is non-walkable. So he must move down? no. Alternatively, he can move down from (4,3) to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-walkable -> so he can only change orientation to down? But that doesn't help. \n\nHe can move to (5,3) at turn 76? Then at turn 77 move down? but (5,2) is non-walkable. \n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (2,3) at turn 76, then (2,2) is non-walkable, so he must move down to (2,1) at turn 77? \n  - Turn 76: Bob moves left to (2,3)\n  - Turn 77: Bob moves down to (2,2)? cannot because non-walkable. So move down to (2,1) -> if (2,1) is empty? \n  - Then at turn 78, Bob can move right to (3,1)? but at turn 78, Alice might still be at (3,1) or she might have moved.\n\nBut we want Bob to get to (4,1). From (2,1) he can move right to (3,1) and then to (4,1)? \n  - Turn 78: Bob moves right to (3,1) -> but if Alice is still there at turn 78, they cannot occupy the same tile.\n\nWe need to coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can drop the onion on a kitchen counter near and then go get a plate? \n\nBut we have a lot of onions. Maybe Bob should focus on getting a plate for the first soup? \n\nLet's reassess:\n\nThe first soup at (3,0) will be ready at turn 82. We need a plate to serve it. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). \n\nBob can go get a plate:\n\nFrom (3,3) after picking up the onion (if we change plan) or without picking the onion? \n\nBut Bob already picked the onion at turn 75. He can put it on a kitchen counter? \n\nThere is a kitchen counter at (3,2) but it already has an onion? Actually, Bob just picked the onion from (3,2) so now (3,2) is empty? \n\nBob is at (3,3). He can interact with (3,2) again? But now he is holding an onion and (3,2) is empty? The interact rule: \"place items (if player is holding an item and counter is empty)\". So he can place the onion back on (3,2) at turn 76? \n\nBut that seems inefficient. \n\nAlternatively, he can carry the onion to a kitchen counter near the pots? \n\nBut let's focus on the first soup. We need a plate by turn 82. \n\nBob can drop the onion at (3,3) by placing it on a kitchen counter? But (3,3) is not a kitchen counter. He must be adjacent to a kitchen counter to place. \n\nThe nearest kitchen counter to (3,3) is (3,2). He can place the onion back on (3,2) at turn 76? \n\nThen he is free to get a plate. \n\nBut we have 5 turns until the soup is ready. \n\nPlan for Bob:\n  - Turn 75: I (pick up onion from (3,2)) -> now holding onion.\n  - Turn 76: I (place the onion back on (3,2)) because (3,2) is now empty? Yes, he just took it. So he can place it back? Then he is empty again.\n  - Then he can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\nBut the plate dispenser is at (0,2). How to get there?\n  - From (3,3) to (0,2): \n      Move left to (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) [kitchen counter -> non-walkable? but (0,3) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-walkable. So he must go around.\n\nAlternatively, move down? cannot. So:\n  - Turn 77: Bob moves left to (2,3)\n  - Turn 78: Bob moves left to (1,3) -> is (1,3) empty? It's not in the kitchen counter list -> empty.\n  - Turn 79: Bob moves down to (1,2) -> is (1,2) empty? Not in the list -> empty.\n  - Turn 80: Bob moves left to (0,2) -> but (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-walkable? So he must be adjacent? \n\nAdjacent positions to (0,2): \n  - (0,1): kitchen counter (in list) -> non-walkable.\n  - (0,3): kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n  - (1,2): empty? -> walkable.\n\nSo Bob can stand at (1,2) and face left to interact with the plate dispenser? But (0,2) is to the left of (1,2). \n\nAt turn 80, Bob is at (1,2) and facing? We must set orientation. He needs to face left (L) to interact with (0,2). \n\nSo:\n  - Turn 80: Bob moves left? cannot because (0,2) non-walkable -> so he changes orientation to left (L) without moving.\n  - Turn 81: Bob does I (interact) to get a plate.\n\nThen he holds a plate. Then he must go to the pot at (3,0) to get the soup when it's ready (at turn 82). \n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 82. Bob is at (1,2) at turn 81. He needs to go to (3,1) to interact with (3,0). \n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1):\n  - Turn 82: move right to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable) -> so he must go around: \n      Turn 82: move right to (2,2) -> cannot, so change orientation? No, we need to move. \n      Instead, move down to (1,1) -> is (1,1) empty? Not in the kitchen counter list -> empty.\n      Then turn 83: move right to (2,1) -> empty.\n      Turn 84: move right to (3,1) -> if available.\n\nBut at turn 84, the soup is already ready for 2 turns? But we want to serve as soon as possible.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,2) to (3,1) via (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). \n  - Turn 82: move down to (1,1)\n  - Turn 83: move right to (2,1)\n  - Turn 84: move right to (3,1)\n\nThen at (3,1) he can face down and interact to get the soup? \n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 82. He can get it at turn 84. \n\nMeanwhile, Alice can get the plate? But she is free after turn 77.\n\nAfter Alice adds the onion at turn 77, she is at (3,1) holding nothing. She can then go to get a plate? \n\nBut Bob is already going? We can have Alice get the plate? \n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob focus on the plate and Alice help with the second soup.\n\nLet's plan for Alice after turn 77:\n\nAfter adding the onion to (3,0) at turn 77, Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing. She can then help with the second soup at (4,0). \n\nBut (4,0) is adjacent to (4,1) and (3,0) and (5,0). (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. (3,0) is a pot -> non-walkable. So only (4,1) is adjacent. \n\nAlice is at (3,1). She can move right to (4,1) at turn 78. Then face down to interact with (4,0) to add an onion? But she doesn't have an onion. \n\nShe can go to a kitchen counter to pick up an onion. The nearest is (3,2) above her? \n  - From (3,1), she can move up to (3,2)? but (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must be adjacent to pick up. \n  - She can face up at (3,1) and interact to pick up from (3,2) if it has an item. \n\nBut at turn 75, Bob picked the onion from (3,2) and then placed it back at turn 76? So at turn 77, (3,2) has an onion? \n\nBut Bob's actions:\n  - Turn 75: Bob picks onion from (3,2) -> (3,2) becomes empty.\n  - Turn 76: Bob places it back? -> (3,2) has an onion again.\n\nSo at turn 77, (3,2) has an onion. \n\nAlice at (3,1) can:\n  - Turn 78: U (change orientation to up? without moving, because (3,2) non-walkable) -> then she faces up.\n  - Turn 79: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2)) -> now she holds an onion.\n\nThen she can add it to the pot at (4,0). \n  - She is at (3,1) -> move right to (4,1) at turn 80.\n  - Turn 81: D (face down to (4,0))\n  - Turn 82: I (add onion to (4,0))\n\nBut note: the pot at (4,0) now has one onion. We need two more. \n\nMeanwhile, the first soup at (3,0) is ready at turn 82. We need to serve it. \n\nWe can have Bob get the plate and serve the first soup. \n\nBob's plan revised without placing the onion back? \n\nAlternative: Bob does not place the onion back. He carries the onion to a kitchen counter near the pots? For example, at (5,0) which is a kitchen counter and has an onion? But (5,0) already has an onion? The non-empty kitchen counters include (5,0)? The list says (6,0) has an onion, but (5,0) is a kitchen counter and not listed as non-empty? So it might be empty. \n\nBut we don't know the state of (5,0). The non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2). So (5,0) is not listed -> it's empty? \n\nSo Bob can:\n  - Turn 75: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n  - Then he can go to (5,0) to place the onion? \n      How? From (3,3) to (5,0): \n          Move right to (4,3) -> then down? cannot because (4,2) non-walkable. \n          Move left to (2,3) -> then down to (2,1) -> then right to (3,1) -> then right to (4,1) -> then down? cannot to (4,0). \n          Then to (5,0): from (4,1) move right to (5,1) -> is (5,1) empty? \n          Then from (5,1) face down to interact with (5,0)? \n\nBut (5,0) is a kitchen counter. So he can stand at (5,1) and face down to place the onion on (5,0). \n\nBut this is long and might conflict with Alice.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on the first soup and getting it delivered within 10 turns.\n\nRevised plan:\n\n### Alice:\n  - Turn 75: L (move left to (3,1))\n  - Turn 76: D (face down to interact with (3,0))\n  - Turn 77: I (add onion to (3,0)) -> now the pot starts cooking. Alice is now empty.\n\n### Bob:\n  - Turn 75: I (pick up onion from (3,2)) -> now holding onion.\n  - But then we want Bob to get a plate. So he should drop the onion quickly. \n  - Turn 76: I (place the onion back on (3,2)) -> now empty.\n  - Then Bob goes to get a plate:\n        Turn 77: L (move left to (2,3))\n        Turn 78: L (move left to (1,3))\n        Turn 79: D (move down to (1,2))\n        Turn 80: L (change orientation to left to face the plate dispenser at (0,2)) -> because (0,2) is non-walkable, so he only changes orientation.\n        Turn 81: I (grab a plate) -> now holding a plate.\n\n  - Then he must go to (3,0) to get the soup when ready at turn 82.\n        From (1,2) to (3,1):\n            Turn 82: R (move right to (2,2)) -> cannot, non-walkable -> so change orientation to right? But we need to move. \n            Instead, move down to (1,1) at turn 82.\n            Turn 83: R (move right to (2,1))\n            Turn 84: R (move right to (3,1))\n\n        Then at (3,1) at turn 84, he faces down (D) at turn 85.\n        Turn 86: I (interact to get the soup from (3,0)) -> now holding a soup.\n\n        Then he must deliver to serving counter at (7,2). \n            From (3,1) to (7,2):\n                He can move right to (4,1) -> then up to (4,2) non-walkable -> so move down to (3,0) non-walkable -> \n                So move right to (4,1) at turn 86.\n                Then down? cannot. Then right to (5,1) at turn 87.\n                Then up to (5,2) non-walkable -> so move down to (5,0) non-walkable -> \n                Then right to (6,1)? (6,1) is empty? \n                Then up to (6,2) non-walkable? (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter list -> empty? \n                Then right to (7,2) at turn 88? But (7,2) is the serving counter -> non-walkable. So he must be adjacent.\n\n            Adjacent positions to (7,2):\n                (7,1): kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n                (7,3): kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n                (6,2): empty? -> walkable.\n\n            So he can stand at (6,2) and face right to interact with (7,2).\n\n            How to get to (6,2):\n                From (5,1) at turn 87, move up to (5,2) non-walkable -> cannot.\n                From (5,1) move right to (6,1) at turn 87.\n                Turn 88: move up to (6,2) -> if walkable? (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter list -> empty.\n                Turn 89: R (face right to (7,2))\n                Turn 90: I (deliver)\n\nThis takes until turn 90, which is 15 turns from turn 75. And we only planned for Alice for 3 turns and Bob for 16 turns? But we are to plan for several turns (H), say 10.\n\nWe need a shorter plan. \n\nAlternatively, Alice can get the plate after she adds the onion. \n\nAlice after turn 77 is at (3,1) empty. She can go to (0,2) to get a plate? \n  - From (3,1) to (0,2): \n        Move left to (2,1) -> then left to (1,1) -> then left to (0,1) but (0,1) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n        So she must go up? \n        From (3,1) move up to (3,2) non-walkable -> cannot. \n        So move left to (2,1) -> then up to (2,2) non-walkable -> cannot. \n        Then to (1,1) -> then up to (1,2) -> then interact with plate dispenser.\n\n  - Turn 78: Alice moves left to (2,1)\n  - Turn 79: Alice moves left to (1,1)\n  - Turn 80: Alice moves up to (1,2)\n  - Turn 81: Alice changes orientation to left (L) to face (0,2)\n  - Turn 82: Alice does I (grab plate) -> holds plate.\n\nThen the soup is ready at turn 82. She needs to be at (3,1) to interact with (3,0). \n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1):\n  - Turn 83: move right to (2,2) non-walkable -> cannot.\n  - So move down to (1,1) at turn 83.\n  - Turn 84: move right to (2,1)\n  - Turn 85: move right to (3,1)\n  - Turn 86: face down (D)\n  - Turn 87: I (get soup)\n\nThen deliver to (7,2):\n  - From (3,1) to (7,2): as before, takes several turns.\n\nThis is also long.\n\n## Optimized Plan for First Soup:\n\nWe have a kitchen counter at (6,0) with an onion. But we don't need it immediately.\n\nAlternative: use the onion on the kitchen counter at (6,0) for the second soup.\n\nFor the first soup, since it will be ready at turn 82, we can have Alice or Bob get the plate during the cooking time.\n\nBut the closest player to the plate dispenser is currently both far.\n\nBob is at (3,3) and Alice will be at (3,1) at turn 77. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). The distance is about 3-4 moves to get there, plus orientation and interact.\n\nBut we have 5 turns (77 to 81) to get the plate and be back at (3,1) by turn 82.\n\nIt's tight.\n\nLet's calculate for Alice:\n  - After turn 77 (at (3,1) empty), she can:\n        Turn 78: move left to (2,1)\n        Turn 79: move left to (1,1)\n        Turn 80: move up to (1,2)  [now at (1,2)]\n        Turn 81: change orientation to left (L) to face (0,2) -> no move.\n        Turn 82: I (grab plate) -> now holding plate at turn 82.\n\n        But the soup is ready at turn 82. She is at (1,2) far from (3,0). She needs to go to (3,1) to get the soup.\n\n        This will take additional turns: \n            Turn 83: move down to (1,1)\n            Turn 84: move right to (2,1)\n            Turn 85: move right to (3,1)\n            Turn 86: face down (D)\n            Turn 87: I (get soup)\n\n        Then she can deliver.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 82, and she doesn't get it until turn 87. \n\nDuring turns 82-87, the soup is in the pot and not served.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can do nothing? \n\nBut Bob is free after turn 76 (when he placed the onion back). \n\nBob can go to the plate dispenser? \n\nBob's timeline:\n  - Turn 76: placed onion back at (3,2) -> empty at (3,3)\n  - Turn 77: move left to (2,3)\n  - Turn 78: move left to (1,3)\n  - Turn 79: move down to (1,2)\n  - Turn 80: change orientation to left (L) to face (0,2)\n  - Turn 81: I (grab plate) -> holds plate at turn 81.\n  - Then he can be at (3,1) by turn 82? \n        From (1,2) to (3,1):\n            Turn 82: move down to (1,1)\n            Turn 83: move right to (2,1)\n            Turn 84: move right to (3,1) -> arrives at turn 84.\n        Then turn 85: face down (D)\n        Turn 86: I (get soup) -> at turn 86.\n\n        The soup is ready at turn 82, so he gets it at turn 86.\n\nThen deliver from (3,1) to (7,2):\n  - Turn 87: move right to (4,1)\n  - Turn 88: move up? cannot to (4,2) non-walkable. So move down? cannot. \n  - So move right to (5,1) at turn 87.\n  - Turn 88: move up to (5,2) non-walkable -> cannot. \n  - So move right to (6,1) at turn 88.\n  - Turn 89: move up to (6,2) [empty]\n  - Turn 90: face right (R) to (7,2)\n  - Turn 91: I (deliver)\n\nThis is turn 91 for one soup.\n\nBut we are only planning for several turns (say 10) from turn 75, so up to turn 85. We might not see the delivery.\n\n## Conclusion for the first soup:\n\nWe should plan the next 10 turns (up to turn 85) to start the first soup and get the plate and be in position to serve as soon as the soup is ready.\n\nAt turn 85, we want to have a player with a plate at (3,1) facing down, ready to interact with (3,0) at turn 82 (but turn 82 is before 85) -> no, turn 82 is within 7 turns from 75.\n\nBut our plan only goes to turn 85 (10 turns from 75: 75 to 84).\n\nSo at turn 84, we want a player at (3,1) facing down, holding a plate, and then at turn 85 they can interact to get the soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 82, so they can interact at turn 82 or later. \n\nSo by turn 82, we want a player with a plate at (3,1) facing down.\n\n### How to achieve that with Alice or Bob.\n\nAlice will be at (3,1) at turn 77. She can then go get a plate and return by turn 82.\n\nAlice's schedule after turn 77:\n  - Turn 78: move left to (2,1)\n  - Turn 79: move left to (1,1)\n  - Turn 80: move up to (1,2)\n  - Turn 81: face left (L) [toward (0,2)]\n  - Turn 82: I (grab plate) -> at (1,2) holding plate at turn 82.\n\nBut then she is at (1,2) at turn 82, not at (3,1). She cannot be at (3,1) until turn 84 at the earliest.\n\nSo not by turn 82.\n\nBob can try to get the plate and be back by turn 82.\n\nBob's schedule after turn 76 (empty at (3,3)):\n  - Turn 77: move left to (2,3)\n  - Turn 78: move left to (1,3)\n  - Turn 79: move down to (1,2)\n  - Turn 80: face left (L)\n  - Turn 81: I (grab plate) -> at (1,2) holding plate at turn 81.\n  - Then to (3,1) by turn 82:\n        Turn 82: move down to (1,1)\n        Turn 83: move right to (2,1)\n        Turn 84: move right to (3,1) -> arrives at turn 84.\n\nSo at turn 84, Bob is at (3,1) holding a plate. He can then face down at turn 85 and interact at turn 86.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 82, so it waits.\n\n### Since we cannot have the plate at (3,1) by turn 82, we accept that the soup will be picked up after turn 82.\n\n## Final Plan for the next 10 turns (75 to 84):\n\nWe'll plan for Alice and Bob.\n\n### Alice:\n  - Turn 75: L (move left to (3,1))\n  - Turn 76: D (face down)\n  - Turn 77: I (interact to add onion to (3,0))\n  - Then she is free. She can help with the second soup or get a plate. But to avoid conflict, let's have her gather an onion for the second pot.\n\nAlice after turn 77 at (3,1) empty:\n  - She can pick up the onion from (3,2) (which is above her) and then move to (4,1) to add it to (4,0).\n\n  - Turn 78: U (face up)\n  - Turn 79: I (pick up onion from (3,2)) -> holding onion.\n  - Turn 80: R (move right to (4,1))\n  - Turn 81: D (face down to (4,0))\n  - Turn 82: I (add onion to (4,0)) -> now (4,0) has 1 onion.\n\n  - Then she can get another onion for (4,0) from a nearby counter, e.g., (5,2) or (2,2).\n\n### Bob:\n  - Turn 75: I (pick up onion from (3,2)) -> holding onion.\n  - Turn 76: I (place it back on (3,2)) -> because we want Alice to use it, but now she will pick it at turn 79. \n  - This is conflict: at turn 76, Bob places the onion back, then at turn 79 Alice picks it. \n\n  - Alternatively, Bob can keep the onion and use it for the second pot? \n\n  - Turn 75: I (pick up onion from (3,2)) -> holding onion.\n  - Then he can go to (4,1) to add it to (4,0). But he is at (3,3) and holding onion.\n\n  - How to get to (4,1)? \n        Turn 76: move right to (4,3)\n        Turn 77: move down? cannot to (4,2) non-walkable. \n        So move down to (3,2) non-walkable -> not possible. \n        So move down from (4,3) to (4,2) non-walkable -> only change orientation to down? \n        Then he is still at (4,3) facing down at turn 77.\n\n        Then Turn 78: move down? still cannot. \n\n  - Alternatively, from (3,3) holding onion, he can move right to (4,3) at turn 76.\n        Then move down is not possible. \n        Then move left back to (3,3) at turn 77? \n        Then move down to (3,2) non-walkable -> not possible.\n\n  - So he must drop the onion. \n\n  - Turn 76: I (place the onion on (3,2)) -> because (3,2) is empty now (he took it) -> so he can place it back. \n        Then he is empty.\n  - Then he can go to get a plate as before.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are limited to 10 turns, we output a plan that focuses on the first soup and setting up for the second.\n\n## Submitted Plan (for turns 75 to 84):\n\nAlice's actions:\n  - Turn 75: L\n  - Turn 76: D\n  - Turn 77: I\n  - Turn 78: U   (face up to interact with (3,2))\n  - Turn 79: I   (pick up onion from (3,2))\n  - Turn 80: R   (move to (4,1))\n  - Turn 81: D   (face down to (4,0))\n  - Turn 82: I   (add onion to (4,0))\n  - Turn 83: (now holding nothing, can go to get another onion)\n        She can move to (5,1) to be near the onion at (5,2)? \n        From (4,1) move right to (5,1) -> turn 83: R\n        Then face up to (5,2) at turn 84: U (orientation change)\n\nBob's actions:\n  - Turn 75: I   (pick up onion from (3,2) -> but then at turn 75, (3,2) has an onion, so he picks it. Then at turn 79, when Alice tries to pick, it's gone? \n  - We must avoid that. \n\n So we should have Bob not pick from (3,2) if Alice will use it.\n\n Instead, Bob can go to (5,2) to pick up the onion there for the second pot.\n\n Bob's position (3,3) to (5,2):\n  - (5,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he must be adjacent. \n  - Adjacent empty tiles to (5,2): \n        (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2). \n        (5,3) is empty? (5,3) not in kitchen counter list -> empty.\n        (5,1) empty.\n        (4,2) kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n        (6,2) empty.\n\n  - Bob can go to (5,3) or (6,2) or (5,1).\n\n  - From (3,3): \n        Turn 75: R (move right to (4,3))\n        Turn 76: R (move right to (5,3))\n        Then at (5,3), he can face down to interact with (5,2)? \n        Turn 77: D (face down)\n        Turn 78: I (pick up onion from (5,2)) -> holding onion.\n        Then he can go to (4,1) to add to (4,0)? But Alice might be there.\n\n  - But Alice will be at (4,1) at turn 80-82. \n\n  - So after picking up, he can go to (5,1) or (6,1) to be near (4,1) later.\n\n  - Turn 79: move down to (5,2) non-walkable -> cannot. So move down to (5,2) -> only orientation? \n        He is at (5,3) -> move down: to (5,2) non-walkable -> so only change orientation to down? \n        Then he is still at (5,3) facing down.\n\n  - Then he can move left to (4,3) at turn 79.\n        Turn 80: move down to (4,2) non-walkable -> cannot.\n        So move down to (4,2) -> only orientation? \n\n  - This is messy.\n\n Given the time constraints, we'll plan only for Alice and let Bob get the plate.\n\n But the instructions say: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\n We are required to output only Alice's actions? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can output only Alice's actions and assume Bob will be controlled by someone else? But we are to optimize coordination.\n\n Since the task might expect only Alice's actions, but we can include Bob's if we want.\n\n But the answer format only shows actions for turns, without specifying player. Let me check the answer format:\n\n \\boxed{\n Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n ...\n }\n\n It doesn't specify for which player. But the task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\n Re-reading: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\n It is ambiguous. But typically in such problems, we control one agent. Here, we are to control Alice, and Bob is the teammate. We can optionally control Bob.\n\n Since the environment is collaborative, we can plan for both.\n\n But the answer format does not differentiate between Alice and Bob. \n\n How to output actions for both players per turn?\n\n The format might be per turn, but then we need to specify which action is for which player.\n\n The problem does not specify. \n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the task says \"for Alice\", I will output only Alice's actions and assume Bob is controlled optimally by the environment or separately.\n\n So we output only Alice's actions for the next 10 turns.\n\n### Alice's actions turns 75 to 84:\n\n  - Turn 75: L (move left to (3,1))\n  - Turn 76: D (face down to interact with (3,0))\n  - Turn 77: I (add onion to (3,0))\n  - Turn 78: U (face up to interact with (3,2))\n  - Turn 79: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n  - Turn 80: R (move right to (4,1))\n  - Turn 81: D (face down to (4,0))\n  - Turn 82: I (add onion to (4,0)) -> (4,0) now has 1 onion.\n  - Turn 83: R (move right to (5,1)) \n  - Turn 84: U (face up to interact with (5,2) which has an onion)\n\n This is 10 actions (75 to 84).\n\n But at turn 79, when Alice tries to pick up from (3,2), it may not be there if Bob took it. But we are not controlling Bob, so we hope the environment (or Bob's controller) will leave it for Alice.\n\n Alternatively, we can have Alice go to a different onion.\n\n Given the instructions, we output Alice's actions.\n\n# Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: L\nTurn 76: D\nTurn 77: I\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: I\nTurn 80: R\nTurn 81: D\nTurn 82: I\nTurn 83: R\nTurn 84: U\n}\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on completing the first soup in the pot at (3, 0) and initiating a second soup in the pot at (4, 0). The current state shows the pot at (3, 0) has 2 onions and needs one more to start cooking (which Alice is holding). After adding the onion, the soup will cook for 5 turns (ready at turn 82). Alice should then gather ingredients for the second soup. Bob, though not directly controlled, is assumed to assist optimally (e.g., fetching a plate for the first soup or gathering onions).\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 75–84):\n- **Turn 75 (L)**: Move left to (3, 1) to position adjacent to the pot at (3, 0).\n- **Turn 76 (D)**: Face down toward (3, 0) to prepare for interaction (no move as tile is non-empty).\n- **Turn 77 (I)**: Interact to add the onion to (3, 0), starting the cooking process (soup ready at turn 82).\n- **Turn 78 (U)**: Face up toward the kitchen counter at (3, 2) (which holds an onion).\n- **Turn 79 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (3, 2).\n- **Turn 80 (R)**: Move right to (4, 1) to position adjacent to the pot at (4, 0).\n- **Turn 81 (D)**: Face down toward (4, 0) to prepare for interaction.\n- **Turn 82 (I)**: Interact to add the onion to (4, 0) (now has 1 onion; more needed for full recipe).\n- **Turn 83 (R)**: Move right to (5, 1) to position near the kitchen counter at (5, 2) (which holds an onion).\n- **Turn 84 (U)**: Face up toward (5, 2) to prepare for interaction (pick up onion on next turn).\n\n### Coordination & Optimization:\n- **First Soup Handling**: Alice starts cooking at turn 77. By turn 82, Bob (optimally controlled) should fetch a plate from (0, 2) and be at (3, 1) to serve the soup immediately when ready.\n- **Second Soup Setup**: Alice uses onions from kitchen counters (e.g., (3, 2), (5, 2)) to minimize trips to dispensers. After turn 84, Alice will pick up the onion at (5, 2) and add it to (4, 0), then gather the third onion (e.g., from (2, 2) or (5, 4)).\n- **Efficiency**: Actions avoid collisions and leverage existing resources (onions on counters). Total reward is maximized by preparing two soups concurrently.\n\nThis sequence ensures Alice contributes optimally to soup completion while coordinating with Bob for serving. The plan covers 10 turns, setting up both soups for delivery.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: L\nTurn 76: D\nTurn 77: I\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: I\nTurn 80: R\nTurn 81: D\nTurn 82: I\nTurn 83: R\nTurn 84: U\n}",

Since there are no tomato dispensers, we can only make onion soup. Also, from the current state, the pot at (3,0) already has 2 onions, so it needs one more onion to start cooking.\n\nAlice is at (2,1) holding nothing, facing left. Bob is at (1,3) holding nothing, facing left.\n\nThere are several kitchen counters with onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3) all have onions. So onions are available on counters; we don't necessarily need to go to dispensers yet.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2), and the serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nSince the pot at (3,0) has 2 onions, adding one more onion will start the cooking. Cooking takes 5 turns, and after that, we need to serve it with a plate to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nWe're at turn 79. I need to plan actions for Alice for the next several turns, say H turns. H isn't specified, so I should choose a reasonable horizon, maybe until we can deliver one soup or something.\n\nLet me sketch out the steps:\n\n1. Add one onion to the pot at (3,0) to start cooking.\n\n2. Once cooking starts, it will take 5 turns to cook.\n\n3. After cooking, someone needs to get a plate, pick up the soup from the pot, and deliver it to (7,2).\n\nAlice and Bob are both free. Alice is closer to the pot, I think. Alice at (2,1), pot at (3,0). Bob is at (1,3), which is farther.\n\nCoordinates: x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Let's list the positions.\n\nGrid: I should map the tiles.\n\nFrom tile types:\n\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pot: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nAlice at (2,1), facing left.\n\nBob at (1,3), facing left.\n\nPot at (3,0) has 2 onions, not full, cooking not started.\n\nTo add an onion to the pot, a player needs to be holding an onion and interact with the pot while facing it.\n\nPlayers can pick up onions from kitchen counters or dispensers.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, we can use those.\n\nFor example, kitchen counter at (2,2) has an onion, which is very close to Alice.\n\nAlice is at (2,1), so (2,2) is one tile above? y-coordinates: if y increases up, then (2,2) is north of (2,1).\n\nAlice at (2,1), facing left. To interact with (2,2), which is above her, she needs to face up and be adjacent.\n\nCurrently, she is at (2,1), so adjacent tiles: left (1,1), right (3,1), up (2,2), down (2,0).\n\n(2,0) is a kitchen counter, which might be occupied? Non-empty kitchen counters listed: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3). (2,0) is not listed as having something, so it might be empty.\n\nKitchen counters can hold items; the non-empty ones are listed with onions. (2,0) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is not a counter, it's empty tile since Alice is there.\n\nAlice can move to interact with (2,2).\n\n(2,2) has an onion, so Alice can pick it up.\n\nBut she needs to be facing it and adjacent.\n\nCurrently at (2,1), facing left. To interact with (2,2), she needs to move up to (2,2)? No, she can't move onto (2,2) because it's a kitchen counter with an item, so it's not walkable. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles.\n\nFrom constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and kitchen counter with item is non-empty.\n\nAlso, \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo for (2,2), which has an onion, it is non-empty, so Alice can stand on an adjacent empty tile and face it to interact.\n\nAdjacent empty tiles to (2,2): (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is empty tile, Alice is there. (2,3) - is that empty? Not listed, so probably empty tile. (1,2) and (3,2): (3,2) has an onion, so non-empty, not walkable. (1,2) - is it a counter? Kitchen counters include (2,2) but not (1,2), so (1,2) might be empty tile.\n\nList all tiles or assume others are empty except specified.\n\nTypically in Overcooked, the grid has walkable and non-walkable, but here only specific tiles are mentioned, so I think unspecified tiles are empty and walkable.\n\nFor example, (2,1) is where Alice is, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): not in kitchen counter list, not dispenser, etc., so should be empty tile.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter with onion, so non-empty.\n\nSo for (2,2), adjacent empty tiles: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), and (3,2) is occupied, so not available.\n\n(3,2) is the tile itself, adjacent tiles are around it.\n\nTile (2,2) has neighbors: north (2,3), south (2,1), west (1,2), east (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is empty, Alice is there.\n\n(2,3): let's see, not listed, so empty tile.\n\n(1,2): not listed, empty tile.\n\n(3,2): kitchen counter with onion, so non-empty tile, not walkable, and not adjacent for interaction since it's the tile itself? No, for interaction, you stand on adjacent tile and face the target tile.\n\nSo for Alice at (2,1), which is south of (2,2), she can interact with (2,2) if she faces north (up).\n\nCurrently, she is facing left (west), so she needs to change orientation to up.\n\nShe can do that without moving.\n\nThen interact to pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, other actions.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nFirst priority: add one onion to the pot at (3,0) to start cooking.\n\nAlice is at (2,1), which is close.\n\nPot at (3,0), which is south-east? (2,1) to (3,0): x from 2 to 3, y from 1 to 0, so south-east direction.\n\nAlice needs to get to a position where she can interact with the pot.\n\nPot at (3,0), which is a tile. Adjacent empty tiles: let's find.\n\n(3,0) has neighbors: north (3,1), south (3,-1)? Probably y min is 0, so no south. West (2,0), east (4,0), north (3,1).\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, and it's empty? Not listed in non-empty, so probably empty kitchen counter, but kitchen counter is a tile type, and if empty, it might be walkable? No.\n\nTile types: kitchen counter is a tile type, which can be empty or have an item.\n\nIf it has an item, it's non-empty and not walkable.\n\nIf empty, it is walkable and can be used for storage.\n\nFrom the list: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nBut for empty kitchen counter, it is walkable, I think.\n\nIn Overcooked, counters are walkable when empty, I believe.\n\nSimilarly, dispensers are not walkable, I think.\n\nLet's check the rules.\n\n\"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo for interacting, you stand on an empty tile adjacent to the target tile.\n\nThe target tile could be a counter, dispenser, etc., but you stand on an empty tile next to it.\n\nFor example, to interact with a pot at (3,0), you need to stand on an adjacent empty tile and face (3,0).\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,0): (3,1), (2,0), (4,0).\n\n(3,1): is it empty? Alice is at (2,1), so (3,1) should be empty tile, not listed as special.\n\n(2,0): kitchen counter, and not listed as non-empty, so it is empty, therefore walkable and you can stand on it? But when you stand on a kitchen counter, if it's empty, you can place or pick up, but for interacting with another tile, you might stand on it.\n\nThe rule says \"standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile\" – \"empty tile\" meaning walkable and not occupied.\n\nKitchen counter when empty is walkable, so it can be an \"empty tile\" for this purpose.\n\nSimilarly, (4,0) is pot, but pot is a tile type, and it can have items or not, but it's not typically walkable? Pots are not walkable, I think.\n\nLet's clarify tile walkability.\n\nFrom tile types:\n\n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n\n- Dispensers: Sources for items – probably not walkable.\n\n- Pot: Cooks soup – not walkable.\n\n- Serving Counter: Deliver soup – not walkable.\n\n- Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage – if empty, walkable; if occupied, not walkable.\n\nIn the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles include dispensers, pots, serving counters, and occupied kitchen counters, I assume.\n\nFor empty kitchen counters, they are walkable.\n\nSimilarly, empty tiles are walkable.\n\nFor pot at (3,0), it is a tile, and since it has items (2 onions), it is non-empty, so not walkable.\n\nAdjacent tiles: (3,1), (2,0), (4,0).\n\n(3,1): should be empty tile, walkable.\n\n(2,0): kitchen counter, not listed as non-empty, so empty, therefore walkable.\n\n(4,0): another pot, which has no onions? Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). (3,0) has 2 onions, so non-empty. (4,0) has nothing? Not mentioned, so probably empty, but pot is a tile type, not walkable even if empty? I think in Overcooked, pots are not walkable regardless.\n\nBut the rule doesn't specify, but from \"non-empty tiles\" are not walkable, but pots and dispensers are always non-empty in terms of being interactable, but they might not have items; a pot can be empty.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nAnd \"non-empty tiles\" – what defines empty?\n\nFrom the context, tiles like dispensers, pots, serving counters are always \"non-empty\" in the sense that they are interactive objects, not walkable.\n\nKitchen counters can be empty or occupied.\n\nIn the tile types, it says \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" implying that other tiles are not always walkable.\n\nAlso, in the interact rule, it distinguishes between the tile you stand on (empty tile) and the tile you interact with (non-empty tile).\n\nSo, for example, to interact with a pot, you stand on an adjacent empty tile (which could be an empty tile or an empty kitchen counter) and face the pot.\n\nSimilarly for dispensers, etc.\n\nFor pot at (3,0), adjacent empty tiles: (3,1), (2,0), (4,0).\n\n(3,1): empty tile, walkable.\n\n(2,0): kitchen counter, empty, so walkable.\n\n(4,0): is a pot tile, which is not walkable, so you cannot stand on it. Therefore, only (3,1) and (2,0) are possible positions to interact with (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, for (4,0), adjacent tiles would be (4,1), (3,0), (5,0), etc., but (3,0) is occupied, (5,0) is kitchen counter with onion? (5,0) is listed in kitchen counters, but non-empty? Non-empty kitchen counters are listed separately.\n\nKitchen counters: positions given, and non-empty ones are specified.\n\nFor example, (6,0) has onion, so non-empty, not walkable.\n\n(5,0) is a kitchen counter, not listed as non-empty, so empty, walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,0) is kitchen counter, not listed as non-empty, so empty, walkable.\n\n(4,0) is pot, not walkable.\n\nSo for pot at (3,0), to interact, you can stand on (3,1) or (2,0) and face (3,0).\n\nNow, Alice is at (2,1), which is adjacent to (2,0) and (3,1), etc.\n\n(2,1) is directly above (2,0) if y increases up.\n\nCoordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, x right, y up. So (2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\n(2,0) is below it, (3,1) is east, (1,1) is west, (2,2) is north.\n\nAlice at (2,1), facing left (west).\n\nTo interact with pot at (3,0), she can go to (3,1) or (2,0).\n\n(3,1) is east and down? From (2,1) to (3,1) is east, same y.\n\n(2,1) to (3,1): move right (R).\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face down (D) to interact with (3,0).\n\nOr, from (2,1) move down to (2,0)? (2,0) is kitchen counter, empty, so she can move there.\n\nAt (2,0), she can face east (R) to interact with (3,0).\n\n(2,0) is east of (3,0)? (2,0) and (3,0) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nIf Alice is at (2,0), to interact with (3,0) which is east, she needs to face east (right).\n\nSimilarly, if at (3,1), to interact with (3,0) south, face down.\n\nNow, Alice needs to have an onion to add to the pot.\n\nShe is holding nothing, so she needs to pick up an onion first.\n\nNearest onion is at (2,2), which is north of her.\n\n(2,2) has an onion, and she is at (2,1), which is adjacent and south of (2,2).\n\nSo she can face north (U) and interact to pick up the onion.\n\nThen, with onion, she can go to the pot.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nCurrent turn t=79.\n\nShe is at (2,1), facing left.\n\nAction: to pick up onion from (2,2), she needs to face up. Since she is adjacent and facing the wrong way, she can change orientation to up.\n\nInteract rule: she needs to be facing the tile to interact.\n\nSo she can change orientation to up (U), then interact (I).\n\nChange orientation is an action, like \"U\" for up, which changes orientation without moving if not possible to move, but here she can move, but to interact, she can just change orientation.\n\nPlayer actions: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But it says \"Change Orientation\", which changes the direction without moving, I think.\n\nLet's read: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nThe actions are: Move (L/R/U/D), Change Orientation (L/R/U/D), Interact (I), Stay (S).\n\nFor Move: when you do L/R/U/D, you move in that direction if possible, and orientation changes to that direction.\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nSo Move action changes both position and orientation to face that way.\n\nThen, \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis seems poorly worded. I think it means: Change Orientation action allows you to change orientation without moving, but if you specify a direction, and the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, you might move? But it says \"no move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\", implying that if the adjacent tile is empty, you might move, but that contradicts it being a orientation change only.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or misphrasing.\n\nIn standard Overcooked, there is an action to change facing without moving.\n\nI think here, \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" is meant to change orientation to that direction without moving, regardless of adjacency.\n\nBut the text says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\", which suggests that if adjacent tile is empty, it might move, but that would be the move action.\n\nI think it's an error. Probably, \"Change Orientation\" changes only orientation, no move.\n\nSimilarly, \"Move\" changes position and orientation.\n\nFor example, to change orientation without moving, use Change Orientation action.\n\nTo move and change orientation, use Move action.\n\nIn this case, for Alice at (2,1), to face up without moving, she can do \"Change Orientation U\" or simply \"U\" for orientation change, but the action is specified as L/R/U/D for move or for orientation change separately.\n\nThe action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}, but U,D,L,R can be for move or for orientation change? No, the actions are labeled.\n\nIn the action list: \"Move (L/R/U/D)\", \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\", \"Interact (I)\", \"Stay (S)\".\n\nBut in the answer format, it's {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so I think U,D,L,R can mean either move or orientation change, but it's ambiguous.\n\nLook at the answer format: \"each action a_t ∈ {U, D, L, R, I, S}\"\n\nBut U can mean move up or change orientation to up?\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps in this context, U,D,L,R are used for both, but we need to specify based on context.\n\nFrom the action history: Alice action history: U, I, L, D, L\n\nBob: U, I, L, L, I\n\nSo U could be move or orientation change.\n\nFor example, Alice at some position, if she moves, position changes; if orientation change, position same.\n\nBut we don't have previous positions, so it's hard to tell.\n\nTo simplify, I think for planning, we can use U,D,L,R to mean move in that direction if possible, which changes position and orientation, or if not possible, it might be orientation change, but in this case, since the grid has spaces, it's usually possible to move if adjacent tile is empty.\n\nBut for orientation change without moving, we need to use a different action, but it's not specified.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" is a separate action type, but in the set {U,D,L,R,I,S}, U could be interpreted as move up or orient up.\n\nBut in the action history, it's listed as U, I, etc., so likely U means move up, which includes orientation change.\n\nThen how to change orientation without moving?\n\nFor example, if Alice wants to face a different direction without moving, she needs an action for that.\n\nBut in the actions, \"Change Orientation\" is listed, but in the set, it's not distinguished.\n\nI think for simplicity, in many implementations, U,D,L,R mean move in that direction, changing position and orientation, and if you can't move (because tile not empty), you don't move but may change orientation? The rule says for Move action, it moves if possible.\n\nFor Change Orientation action, it only changes orientation.\n\nBut in the action set, both are mapped to the same symbols U,D,L,R.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nPerhaps we should assume that when a player issues U,D,L,R, it is a move action if possible, or orientation change if not possible, but the rule for Change Orientation says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\", which is consistent with not moving if the tile is not empty.\n\nBut for move action, it moves only if adjacent tile is empty.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), etc.\" – this implies that when you do Move L, you move left if possible, and orientation changes to left.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" – this suggests that for Change Orientation, if you do L, and the left tile is not empty, you don't move, but you change orientation to left. If the left tile is empty, you might move? But that would be move action.\n\nI think the text is ambiguous.\n\nTo resolve, I believe that:\n\n- When you perform a Move action (e.g., \"Move L\"), you attempt to move in that direction; if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable, you move and change orientation; if not, you don't move, but you may change orientation? The rule doesn't say.\n\nFor Move, it says \"Changes position and orientation\", so probably it only happens if the move is possible.\n\nSimilarly, for Change Orientation, it changes orientation without moving, but the \"no move if...\" part is confusing.\n\nPerhaps for Change Orientation action, it always changes orientation without moving, regardless.\n\nBut the \"no move if...\" might be a mistake.\n\nI think for this problem, we can assume that U,D,L,R actions are move actions, which change position and orientation if the move is possible; if not, nothing happens or orientation changes, but it's not specified.\n\nTo be safe, let's look at the action history.\n\nAlice action history: U, I, L, D, L\n\nAt turn 79, after these actions, she is at (2,1), facing left.\n\nWe don't know previous positions, so it's hard to infer.\n\nBob similar.\n\nPerhaps for planning, we can use U,D,L,R to mean move in that direction, and for orientation change without moving, it might not be necessary often, but in this case, for interaction, it might be.\n\nFor example, Alice at (2,1), to interact with (2,2) north, she can face up without moving.\n\nBut if she does \"U\", it could mean move up to (2,2), but (2,2) has an onion, so not walkable, so she can't move there. So if she does \"U\", since (2,2) is not empty, she doesn't move, but does she change orientation to up?\n\nThe rule for Move doesn't say, but for Change Orientation it does.\n\nI think to avoid confusion, I'll assume that when a player issues U,D,L,R, it is intended as a move action, and if the move is not possible, it may have no effect or change orientation, but it's not clear.\n\nPerhaps the action U can be used for both, but in context, for interaction, she can first change orientation then interact.\n\nBut in the action set, there's no separate command for orientation change; it's all U,D,L,R,I,S.\n\nI think I have to make an assumption.\n\nLet's assume that U,D,L,R always refer to move actions, which change position and orientation if possible.\n\nFor changing orientation without moving, it might not be directly possible, or we can use S or something, but S is stay, do nothing.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nAnother idea: in some implementations, \"interact\" can be done from adjacent by facing the direction, so to face a direction, you can use move in that direction if possible, or if not, use a orientation change action.\n\nBut here, since the action set is limited, perhaps for tiles that are adjacent but not walkable, you can still interact by facing them without moving.\n\nFor example, Alice at (2,1), (2,2) is north, not walkable, so she can't move there, but she can face north and interact.\n\nSo if she does \"U\", since (2,2) is not empty, she doesn't move, but she changes orientation to up, I assume, from the Change Orientation rule.\n\nThen she can interact.\n\nSimilarly, for Bob.\n\nI think that's reasonable.\n\nSo for Alice at (2,1), to pick up from (2,2), she can do \"U\" to change orientation to up (since can't move up), then \"I\" to interact and pick up onion.\n\nThen she will be holding an onion.\n\nThen she can go to the pot.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move to (3,1) by doing \"R\" (move right to (3,1), facing right).\n\nThen at (3,1), she can do \"D\" to move down? (3,0) is pot, not walkable, so she can't move down to (3,0). But she can do \"D\" to change orientation to down (since can't move), then \"I\" to interact with (3,0) and add the onion.\n\nSince she is holding an onion, adding to pot with 2 onions will make it full, start cooking.\n\nCooking will start at turn when the third onion is added.\n\nNow, cooking time is 5 turns for the recipe, so after 5 turns, it will be cooked.\n\nThen someone needs to serve it.\n\nTo serve, a player needs to have a clean plate, interact with the pot to get the soup, then go to serving counter at (7,2) and interact to deliver.\n\nPlates are at plate dispenser (0,2) or on counters, but no plates on counters mentioned, so need to get from dispenser.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlso, there is another pot at (4,0), but it's empty, not used yet.\n\nBob is at (1,3), holding nothing.\n\nHe can be assigned to get a plate or something.\n\nFirst, let's plan for Alice to add the onion to the pot.\n\nAt turn 79:\n\nAlice: to pick up onion from (2,2), she is at (2,1), so do \"U\" to face up (since can't move up, changes orientation to up), then \"I\" to interact and pick up onion.\n\nBut \"U\" and \"I\" are two separate actions.\n\nEach turn, one action.\n\nSo turn 79: Alice action.\n\nFirst action: change orientation to up. Since U can mean orientation change or move, but in this case, since she can't move up, \"U\" will change orientation to up.\n\nThen turn 80: \"I\" to interact with (2,2) and pick up onion. Now holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to go to interact with pot.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move right to (3,1) by doing \"R\" on turn 81.\n\nAt (3,1), facing right.\n\nThen turn 82: \"D\" to face down (since can't move down to pot), orientation down.\n\nTurn 83: \"I\" to interact with (3,0) and add onion. Pot now has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking start turn: 83.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so cooked at turn 83 + 5 = turn 88.\n\nAfter adding onion on turn 83, the pot starts cooking, and after 5 turns, it is ready at turn 88.\n\nNow, during turns 84 to 87, cooking is in progress.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can get a plate.\n\nBob is at (1,3), facing left.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser, non-empty tile.\n\nTo interact, need to be adjacent and facing.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (0,2): (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), (-1,2) out of bound, so (0,1), (0,3), (1,2).\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, not listed as non-empty, so empty, walkable.\n\n(0,3) has onion, non-empty, not walkable.\n\n(1,2): not listed, empty tile.\n\nBob at (1,3), which is south-east of (0,3)? (0,3) has onion, but he needs to go to (0,2).\n\nFrom (1,3) to (0,2): he can move left to (0,3)? (0,3) has onion, not walkable, so he can't move there.\n\nHe can move down to (1,2) first? (1,2) should be empty tile.\n\nFrom (1,3), move down to (1,2) by \"D\".\n\nThen at (1,2), he can face west to interact with (0,2).\n\n(1,2) is east of (0,2), so face west (left).\n\nThen interact to get plate.\n\nBob action:\n\nTurn 79: Bob is at (1,3), facing left. He can move down to (1,2) by \"D\" (move down, orientation down).\n\nThen turn 80: at (1,2), facing down. He needs to face west to interact with (0,2). So do \"L\" to change orientation to left (west), since can't move left to (0,2)? (0,2) is dispenser, not walkable, so \"L\" will change orientation to left without moving.\n\nThen turn 81: \"I\" to interact with (0,2) and get plate. Now holding plate.\n\nThen he needs to wait for the soup to be cooked or go to the pot.\n\nBut soup will be ready at turn 88, and it's now turn 81, so he has time.\n\nHe can go near the pot.\n\nPot at (3,0), he is at (1,2), holding plate.\n\nHe can move to (2,2), but (2,2) has onion, not walkable, so he can't.\n\n(2,2) has onion, so not walkable.\n\nHe can go to (2,1) or (3,2), but (3,2) has onion, not walkable.\n\n(2,1) might be occupied by Alice or not.\n\nLet's coordinate.\n\nFirst, Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 79: Alice \"U\" to face up (orientation change, since can't move up)\n\nAfter \"U\", she is at (2,1), facing up.\n\nTurn 80: Alice \"I\" to interact with (2,2) and pick up onion. Now holding onion.\n\nTurn 81: Alice \"R\" to move right to (3,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 82: Alice \"D\" to face down (orientation change, since can't move down)\n\nTurn 83: Alice \"I\" to interact with (3,0), add onion. Pot now cooking. Alice holding nothing after adding.\n\nNow Alice is at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n\nMeanwhile Bob:\n\nTurn 79: Bob \"D\" to move down to (1,2), facing down.\n\nTurn 80: Bob \"L\" to face left (orientation change to west)\n\nTurn 81: Bob \"I\" to interact with (0,2) and get plate. Now at (1,2), facing left, holding plate.\n\nNow turn 81, Bob has plate.\n\nSoup cooking from turn 83 to 87, ready at 88.\n\nBob can go to the pot area to be ready.\n\nFrom (1,2), he can move down to (1,1)? (1,1) should be empty tile.\n\n(1,2) to (1,1): move down \"D\".\n\nThen to (2,1), but (2,1) might be occupied.\n\nAt turn 81, Alice is at (3,1), Bob at (1,2).\n\nTurn 82: Alice is doing \"D\" to face down, no move.\n\nBob turn 82: can move down to (1,1) by \"D\" (move down, orientation down).\n\nThen turn 83: Alice \"I\" at (3,1) to add onion to pot.\n\nBob at (1,1), facing down. He can move right to (2,1) by \"R\" (move right, orientation right).\n\n(2,1) is empty now, since Alice left.\n\nAfter turn 81, Alice at (3,1), so (2,1) empty.\n\nSo Bob turn 83: \"R\" to move to (2,1), facing right.\n\nNow at (2,1), facing right.\n\nPot at (3,0) is south-east? From (2,1), to interact with pot, he can go to (3,1) or (2,0).\n\n(3,1) might be occupied by Alice.\n\nAt turn 83, Alice is at (3,1) interacting, but after interact, she is still at (3,1).\n\nAfter turn 83, Alice at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nBob at (2,1), holding plate.\n\nTo interact with pot, Bob needs to be at (3,1) or (2,0) facing the pot.\n\n(3,1) is occupied by Alice, so he can't go there.\n\nHe can go to (2,0).\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, empty, so walkable.\n\nFrom (2,1), he can move down to (2,0) by \"D\" (move down, orientation down).\n\nThen at (2,0), he can face east to interact with (3,0).\n\nBut soup is not ready until turn 88.\n\nCurrent turn is 83, soup starts cooking, ready at 88.\n\nSo from turn 83 to 87, cooking.\n\nBob can wait or do something else.\n\nHe is at (2,0) or can stay.\n\nBut he needs to interact when soup is ready.\n\nSimilarly, Alice is free.\n\nBut Bob has the plate, so he should be the one to serve.\n\nTo serve soup from pot, when soup is cooked, a player with empty hands can pick up the soup if holding a plate? No.\n\nTo get soup from pot: if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup, interact to get the soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter.\n\nSo Bob has plate, so when soup ready, he can get it.\n\nNow, positions.\n\nAt turn 83: Alice at (3,1), Bob at (2,1) after move? Let's list turns.\n\nTurns:\n\nTurn 79:\n- Alice: \"U\" (face up) at (2,1), now facing up\n- Bob: \"D\" (move to (1,2), facing down)\n\nTurn 80:\n- Alice: \"I\" (pick up onion from (2,2), holding onion)\n- Bob: \"L\" (face left) at (1,2), facing left\n\nTurn 81:\n- Alice: \"R\" (move to (3,1), facing right)\n- Bob: \"I\" (get plate from (0,2), holding plate)\n\nTurn 82:\n- Alice: \"D\" (face down) at (3,1), facing down\n- Bob: \"D\" (move to (1,1), facing down)  // from (1,2) to (1,1)\n\nTurn 83:\n- Alice: \"I\" (add onion to pot at (3,0), pot now cooking, Alice holding nothing)\n- Bob: \"R\" (move to (2,1), facing right)  // from (1,1) to (2,1)\n\nAfter turn 83: Alice at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing. Bob at (2,1), facing right, holding plate.\n\nSoup cooking, ready at turn 88.\n\nNow turns 84 to 87: cooking, no action needed for pot.\n\nPlayers can do other things, like prepare for next soup or something.\n\nBut since we want to maximize reward, and only one recipe, but there is another pot at (4,0), and many onions, so we can start another soup.\n\nBut let's first deliver this one.\n\nBob has plate, needs to get soup when ready.\n\nHe can position to interact with pot.\n\nBut (3,1) is occupied by Alice, so he can go to (2,0).\n\nTurn 84: Bob move down to (2,0) by \"D\" (move down to (2,0), facing down).\n\nThen at (2,0), he can face east to interact with (3,0).\n\nBut soup not ready until turn 88, so he needs to wait.\n\nHe can change orientation to east on turn 85 or something.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (3,1), she can move away to free space or help with something else.\n\nFor example, she can go to get another onion for the other pot.\n\nBut let's focus on delivering this soup first.\n\nAt turn 88, soup ready.\n\nBob at (2,0), he needs to face east to interact with (3,0).\n\nAssume he is facing down after moving to (2,0).\n\nSo on turn 88, he can do \"R\" to face east (right), then \"I\" to interact and get soup on plate.\n\nThen he needs to deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,2).\n\nPath: for example, go to (3,0) but not walkable, so go to (3,1), then east to (4,1), (5,1), etc., but need to avoid obstacles.\n\nFirst, from (2,0), he can move up to (2,1) by \"U\", but (2,1) might be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 84, Alice is at (3,1), Bob at (2,0).\n\nTurn 84: Bob \"D\" to (2,0), facing down.\n\nAlice can move to free space, say, to (4,1) or something.\n\nTurn 84: Alice, since nothing to do, she can stay or move to start another task.\n\nBut let's plan Bob's actions for serving.\n\nFirst, at turn 88, soup ready.\n\nBob at (2,0), facing down (after turn 84 move).\n\nHe needs to interact with (3,0), which is east, so he should face east.\n\nOn turn 88, he can do \"R\" to face east (orientation change), then \"I\" to get soup.\n\nBut turn 88 is when soup ready, so on that turn, he can interact.\n\nBut he needs to be ready.\n\nSince cooking finishes at the beginning of turn 88, I assume, so on turn 88, he can interact.\n\nBut he needs to be facing the pot.\n\nSo on turn 88: Bob \"R\" to face east, then \"I\" to get soup.\n\nBut \"R\" and \"I\" are two actions, so he can't do both in one turn.\n\nProblem: he needs to face the correct direction before turn 88.\n\nSo he should face east in advance.\n\nOn turn 85, for example, he can change orientation to east.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can be doing other things.\n\nSet actions from turn 84 onwards.\n\nTurn 84:\nAlice: she can move, say, to (4,1) to be near the other pot. From (3,1), move right to (4,1) by \"R\".\n\nBob: at (2,0), facing down. He can do \"R\" to face east now, so he is ready to interact when soup ready.\n\nTurn 84 actions:\n- Alice: \"R\" to move to (4,1), facing right\n- Bob: \"R\" to face east (orientation change, since can't move east to pot)\n\nAfter turn 84: Alice at (4,1), facing right; Bob at (2,0), facing east.\n\nNow turns 85,86,87: cooking, players can stay or do other actions.\n\nFor example, Alice can pick up an onion for the other pot at (4,0).\n\n(4,0) is empty pot.\n\nShe can get an onion from nearby, say from (4,2) which has an onion.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice at (4,1), which is south of (4,2).\n\nSo she can interact with (4,2) by facing north.\n\nCurrently facing right, so she needs to face up.\n\nTurn 85: Alice \"U\" to face up (orientation change)\n\nThen turn 86: \"I\" to pick up onion from (4,2), now holding onion.\n\nThen she can add to pot at (4,0).\n\nPot at (4,0), she is at (4,1), south of it.\n\nSo she can face down? (4,0) is south of (4,1), so she needs to face south.\n\nAt (4,1), facing up after turn 85.\n\nTurn 86: after picking up onion, she is at (4,1), facing up? Turn 86: she does \"I\" to pick up, so after, at (4,1), holding onion, facing up (since interact doesn't change position or orientation).\n\nThen to add to (4,0), which is south, she needs to face down.\n\nTurn 87: Alice \"D\" to face down (orientation change)\n\nThen turn 88: she can interact with (4,0) to add onion, but (4,0) is empty pot, adding one onion doesn't start cooking, need three.\n\nBut we can add more later.\n\nFirst, back to Bob for turn 88.\n\nTurn 88: soup at (3,0) ready.\n\nBob at (2,0), facing east, so he can directly \"I\" to interact with (3,0) and get soup on plate. Now holding soup.\n\nThen he needs to deliver to (7,2).\n\nPath from (2,0) to (7,2).\n\nHe can go to (2,1), then to (3,1), but (3,1) might be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 87, Alice is at (4,1), facing down.\n\nOn turn 88, Alice will add onion to (4,0)? But turn 88 she is doing \"I\" to add if she faces down.\n\nBut let's not conflict.\n\nFirst, Bob turn 88: \"I\" to get soup.\n\nNow holding soup.\n\nThen to deliver.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (2,0), he can move up to (2,1), then right to (3,1), then to (4,1), but (4,1) has Alice? On turn 88, Alice is at (4,1), doing action.\n\nTurn 88 actions:\n\n- Bob: \"I\" at (2,0) to get soup, now holding soup.\n\n- Alice: she is at (4,1), facing down, on turn 88 she can \"I\" to interact with (4,0) and add onion, since holding onion. But (4,0) has no onions yet, so adding one onion, pot now has one onion.\n\nAfter turn 88: Alice at (4,1), holding nothing (after adding), facing down? After interact, position and orientation same.\n\nBob at (2,0), holding soup, facing east? After \"I\", he was facing east, still facing east.\n\nNow Bob needs to go to (7,2).\n\nHe can move up to (2,1) by \"U\" on turn 89.\n\nThen to (3,1) by \"R\" on turn 90.\n\n(3,1) should be empty now.\n\nThen to (4,1) by \"R\" turn 91, but (4,1) has Alice? After turn 88, Alice at (4,1).\n\nOn turn 89, Alice might move.\n\nTo avoid conflict, Alice can move away.\n\nAfter turn 88, Alice can go to get another onion or something.\n\nBut let's plan Bob's delivery.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,2): one way is (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (7,1) -> (7,2) but (7,1) is kitchen counter, empty? Kitchen counter at (7,1), not listed non-empty, so empty, walkable. (7,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\nTo interact with serving counter at (7,2), need adjacent tile.\n\nAdjacent to (7,2): (7,1), (7,3), (6,2), (8,2) out, so (7,1), (7,3), (6,2).\n\n(7,1) kitchen counter, empty, walkable.\n\n(7,3) kitchen counter with onion? Non-empty kitchen counters include (7,3)? List: (0,3) has onion, (7,3) is kitchen counter, not listed non-empty, so empty.\n\n(6,2): not listed, empty tile? But (5,2) has onion, etc.\n\n(6,2) is not in kitchen counter list, so empty tile.\n\nSo Bob can go to (7,1) or (6,2) to interact with (7,2).\n\nSay, go to (7,1).\n\nPath: from (2,0) to (7,1).\n\nMove east and north.\n\nFor example: (2,0) -> (3,0) not walkable, so (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (7,1)\n\nThen at (7,1), face north to interact with (7,2).\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) to (6,2) etc.\n\nBut (6,2) might have something? Not listed, so empty.\n\nBut let's use (7,1).\n\nNow turns:\n\nAfter turn 88: Bob at (2,0), holding soup, facing east.\n\nTurn 89: Bob \"U\" to move up to (2,1), facing up.\n\nTurn 90: Bob \"R\" to move right to (3,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 91: Bob \"R\" to move right to (4,1), but (4,1) might have Alice.\n\nAlice at (4,1) after turn 88.\n\nOn turn 89, Alice can move, say, to (4,2) to pick up something, but (4,2) has onion, not walkable.\n\nAlice can move to (5,1) or something.\n\nTo free (4,1), Alice can move right to (5,1) on turn 89.\n\nTurn 89:\n- Alice: \"R\" to move to (5,1), facing right\n- Bob: \"U\" to (2,1), facing up\n\nTurn 90:\n- Alice: at (5,1), can stay or move, but let's say \"S\" for now\n- Bob: \"R\" to (3,1), facing right\n\nTurn 91:\n- Alice: \"S\" or move\n- Bob: \"R\" to move to (4,1), facing right\n\nTurn 92: Bob at (4,1), facing right. He can move right to (5,1), but Alice is there? On turn 90, Alice at (5,1), on turn 91, if Alice stays, she is at (5,1).\n\nSo conflict if Bob moves to (4,1) and then to (5,1).\n\nOn turn 91, Alice can move to (6,1) or something.\n\nTurn 91:\n- Alice: \"R\" to move to (6,1), facing right\n- Bob: \"R\" to (4,1), facing right\n\nThen turn 92:\n- Alice: \"R\" to (7,1)? But Bob needs to go there.\n- Bob: \"R\" to move to (5,1), facing right\n\n(5,1) should be empty after Alice left.\n\nTurn 91: Alice moves to (6,1), so (5,1) free.\n\nTurn 92: Bob \"R\" to (5,1), facing right\n\nThen turn 93: Bob \"R\" to (6,1), facing right\n\nBut (6,1) has Alice on turn 91? Turn 91: Alice to (6,1), turn 92 Alice at (6,1), Bob to (5,1).\n\nTurn 93: Bob \"R\" to (6,1), but (6,1) has Alice, so he can't move there.\n\nProblem.\n\nAlice should move further or stay.\n\nAfter turn 91, Alice at (6,1), Bob at (4,1).\n\nTurn 92:\n- Alice: move to (7,1) by \"R\", but (7,1) is kitchen counter, empty, walkable. Then at (7,1), she can do something, but she has nothing.\n- Bob: \"R\" to (5,1)\n\nTurn 93:\n- Alice: at (7,1), facing right. She can stay or change orientation.\n- Bob: \"R\" to (6,1), facing right\n\nTurn 94: Bob \"R\" to (7,1), but (7,1) has Alice, conflict.\n\nSo Alice should not go to (7,1) if Bob needs it.\n\nAlice can go to (6,2) or something.\n\nBut let's have Alice stay at (6,1) or move to a different spot.\n\nSince Alice is not needed, she can go to prepare for next soup.\n\nFor example, on turn 89, Alice moves to (5,1), then turn 90 to (5,2), but (5,2) has onion, not walkable, so she can't.\n\n(5,2) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nShe can go to (4,2) to pick up onion, but she needs to be adjacent.\n\nAt turn 89, Alice at (5,1), facing right.\n\n(5,2) is north, she can face up and interact to pick up onion, but (5,2) has onion, so she can pick it up if she wants.\n\nBut let's focus on Bob's delivery.\n\nTo simplify, Alice can stay out of the way.\n\nTurn 89: Alice \"U\" to face up (at (5,1), orientation up)\n\nThen turn 90: \"I\" to pick up onion from (5,2), now holding onion.\n\nThen she can go to add to pot at (4,0).\n\nBut (4,0) has one onion from earlier? On turn 88, she added one onion to (4,0), so it has one onion.\n\nShe can add more.\n\nBut first, let's complete the delivery.\n\nBob from (2,0) to (7,1):\n\n- Turn 89: Bob \"U\" to (2,1)\n\n- Turn 90: Bob \"R\" to (3,1)\n\n- Turn 91: Bob \"R\" to (4,1)\n\n- Turn 92: Bob \"R\" to (5,1)\n\n- Turn 93: Bob \"R\" to (6,1)\n\n- Turn 94: Bob \"R\" to (7,1), facing right\n\nAt (7,1), he needs to face north to interact with (7,2) serving counter.\n\nTurn 95: Bob \"U\" to face up (orientation change, since can't move up to (7,2))\n\nTurn 96: Bob \"I\" to deliver soup, reward obtained.\n\nBut this is many turns, and we are at turn 79, planning for several turns, but H not specified.\n\nSince the soup is ready at turn 88, and delivery takes several turns, we can plan until delivery.\n\nBut for Alice, we need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, we can start another soup with the other pot.\n\nBut let's first output the actions for Alice from turn 79.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob, but primarily for Alice.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nBut in answer format, only Alice actions are listed, I think.\n\nLook: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\"\n\nAnd answer format has turns for a_t, which I think is for Alice.\n\nIt says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the box, it might be for Alice only.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1} etc., and a_t for Alice.\n\nBut optionally, we can include Bob, but probably the box is for Alice actions.\n\nTo be safe, I'll plan Alice actions, and mention Bob if needed.\n\nSince Bob is teammate, we need to coordinate.\n\nBut the output is only actions for Alice, I believe.\n\nThe task: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\"\n\nAnd \"Answer Format\" shows only turns with a_t, so likely for Alice.\n\nSo I need to specify Alice's actions.\n\nFrom turn 79.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTo add onion to pot:\n\nTurn 79: \"U\" to face up (to interact with (2,2))\n\nTurn 80: \"I\" to pick up onion\n\nTurn 81: \"R\" to move to (3,1)\n\nTurn 82: \"D\" to face down (to interact with (3,0))\n\nTurn 83: \"I\" to add onion, start cooking\n\nThen from turn 84, she can prepare for next soup.\n\nFor example, go to (4,2) to pick up onion.\n\nAt turn 83, after \"I\", she at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 84: Alice \"R\" to move to (4,1), facing right\n\nTurn 85: \"U\" to face up (to interact with (4,2))\n\nTurn 86: \"I\" to pick up onion from (4,2), holding onion\n\nThen add to pot at (4,0), which has 0 or 1 onion? On turn 88, she added one, but that's later.\n\nOn turn 88, she adds one to (4,0), but at turn 86, (4,0) may have zero.\n\nAfter turn 83, (4,0) is empty.\n\nOn turn 88, she adds one, but before that, on turn 86, she has onion, she can add to (4,0).\n\nAt turn 86: after \"I\", she at (4,1), holding onion, facing up.\n\nPot at (4,0) is south, so she needs to face down.\n\nTurn 87: \"D\" to face down\n\nTurn 88: \"I\" to add onion to (4,0), now (4,0) has one onion.\n\nThen she can get another onion to add.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), she can go to (3,2) or other counter.\n\n(3,2) has onion, north-west? From (4,1), (3,2) is west and north.\n\nShe can move to (3,1) first.\n\nTurn 89: Alice \"L\" to move left to (3,1), facing left\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face north to interact with (3,2), which has onion.\n\n(3,2) is north of (3,1).\n\nTurn 90: \"U\" to face up\n\nTurn 91: \"I\" to pick up onion, holding onion\n\nThen add to (4,0).\n\nFrom (3,1), to (4,0), she can go to (4,1) then face down.\n\nBut (4,1) might be occupied.\n\nSince (4,0) has one onion, adding second.\n\nBut she is at (3,1) after turn 89.\n\nTurn 92: Alice \"R\" to move to (4,1), facing right\n\nTurn 93: \"D\" to face down\n\nTurn 94: \"I\" to add onion to (4,0), now two onions.\n\nThen need one more.\n\nBut this is taking many turns, and we might deliver the first soup.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize reward, and we have many onions, we can start multiple soups.\n\nBut for now, with H=10 or something, we can plan for Alice to add the first onion and start, then prepare for second.\n\nBut let's stop at turn 88 or so.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output Alice actions for several turns.\n\nSay from turn 79 to 88, 10 turns.\n\nTurn 79 to 88 is 10 actions.\n\nTurn 79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88.\n\nAlice actions:\n\n79: U (face up to prepare for picking up onion from (2,2))\n\n80: I (pick up onion)\n\n81: R (move to (3,1))\n\n82: D (face down to prepare for adding to pot)\n\n83: I (add onion, start cooking)\n\n84: R (move to (4,1))\n\n85: U (face up to prepare for picking up from (4,2))\n\n86: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\n87: D (face down to prepare for adding to (4,0))\n\n88: I (add onion to (4,0), now one onion there)\n\nFor Bob, we don't output, but he should be getting plate and serving.\n\nBut for Alice, this sequence.\n\nTo have Alice help with serving, but she has no plate, so not necessary.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 79 to 88:\n\nTurn 79: U  \nTurn 80: I  \nTurn 81: R  \nTurn 82: D  \nTurn 83: I  \nTurn 84: R  \nTurn 85: U  \nTurn 86: I  \nTurn 87: D  \nTurn 88: I\n\nIn this, on turn 88, she adds onion to (4,0), which is fine.\n\nAfter that, she can continue, but for H=10, this is up to turn 88.\n\nt1=79, so turns from 79 to 88 inclusive is 10 turns.\n\nTurn 79,80,...,88 is 10 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the pot at (3,0), with Bob serving, reward at turn 96 or so, but that's later.\n\nBut since we planned Alice actions, it should be ok.\n\nTo include in the plan.\n\nBut the answer is only for Alice.\n\nSo I think this is reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, the primary objective is to complete the onion soup in the pot at (3,0) and deliver it, as it already contains 2 onions and only requires one more to start cooking. Cooking takes 5 turns, after which the soup can be served with a plate for a reward of 20. Alice is positioned close to an onion on the kitchen counter at (2,2) and the pot at (3,0), making her efficient for adding the third onion. Bob, positioned near the plate dispenser at (0,2), should fetch a plate and handle serving the cooked soup to the serving counter at (7,2) once ready. Meanwhile, Alice can initiate a second soup in the empty pot at (4,0) using available onions on counters to increase rewards, though delivery may extend beyond the immediate planning horizon.\n\n### Coordination Plan Summary:\n- **Alice Focus**: Add the third onion to the pot at (3,0) to start cooking, then prepare the second pot at (4,0) by adding onions.\n- **Bob Focus (optional, for coordination)**: Fetch a plate from (0,2), position near (3,0) to serve when cooked (at turn 88), and deliver to (7,2). Detailed Bob actions are not required in output but are included here for context.\n- **Horizon**: 10 turns (turns 79 to 88) to cover adding the onion to start cooking, plus initial steps for the second soup. Soup at (3,0) will be ready at turn 88, and delivery can be handled by Bob afterward.\n- **Key Constraints**: Players cannot occupy the same tile. Alice uses kitchen counters with onions (e.g., (2,2), (4,2)) to avoid dispensers. Orientation changes are used where movement is blocked (e.g., facing a counter or pot without moving onto it).\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 79 to 88):\n- **Turn 79**: Alice at (2,1) facing left. Change orientation to up (U) to face (2,2) for interaction. (Cannot move up as (2,2) is occupied.)\n- **Turn 80**: Interact (I) with (2,2) to pick up onion. Now holding onion.\n- **Turn 81**: Move right (R) to (3,1), facing right. (Position now adjacent to pot at (3,0).)\n- **Turn 82**: Change orientation to down (D) to face (3,0). (Cannot move down as (3,0) is occupied.)\n- **Turn 83**: Interact (I) with (3,0) to add onion. Pot now has 3 onions; cooking starts and will finish at turn 88. Alice now holds nothing.\n- **Turn 84**: Move right (R) to (4,1), facing right. (Positioned near pot at (4,0) and onion at (4,2).)\n- **Turn 85**: Change orientation to up (U) to face (4,2) for interaction. (Cannot move up as (4,2) is occupied.)\n- **Turn 86**: Interact (I) with (4,2) to pick up onion. Now holding onion.\n- **Turn 87**: Change orientation to down (D) to face (4,0). (Cannot move down as (4,0) is occupied.)\n- **Turn 88**: Interact (I) with (4,0) to add onion. Pot now has 1 onion (not full). Alice now holds nothing and can continue gathering for a full soup.\n\n### Bob's Actions for Coordination (Optional, Not in Output):\n- **Turn 79**: Move down (D) to (1,2), facing down.\n- **Turn 80**: Change orientation to left (L) to face (0,2).\n- **Turn 81**: Interact (I) with (0,2) to pick up plate. Now holding plate.\n- **Turn 82**: Move down (D) to (1,1), facing down.\n- **Turn 83**: Move right (R) to (2,1), facing right. (Alice moved to (3,1) on turn 81, so (2,1) is empty.)\n- **Turn 84**: Move down (D) to (2,0), facing down. Then change orientation to right (R) to face (3,0).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 83. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes.\n\nKey observations from the current state:\n- Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n- There is a pot at (3,0) that already has 2 onions and 0 tomatoes. It is not full, so cooking hasn't started. We need one more onion to start cooking.\n- Bob is at (3,3) holding one onion. He is facing up (orientation U). He can move to add the onion to the pot at (3,0) but note that (3,0) is at the bottom of the grid (y=0) and Bob is at (3,3). He must navigate to (3,0) and interact with the pot when adjacent and facing it.\n- Alice is at (2,1) holding nothing. She is facing up (orientation U).\n\nThere are several onions scattered on kitchen counters, but note that the pot only needs one more onion. We can use Bob's onion to complete the pot.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the delivery. Once the pot is full, it will cook for 5 turns. After that, someone must get a plate, pick up the cooked soup, and deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nPlan:\n1. Bob should deliver his onion to the pot at (3,0) as soon as possible to start the cooking. The cooking will then take 5 turns, so it will be ready at turn 88 (83 + 5 = 88? But note: the pot starts cooking when the third ingredient is added, and the turn when the third ingredient is added is the start. So after 5 turns, it will be ready at turn 88 (if added at turn 83, then turns 84,85,86,87,88 -> ready at turn 88? Actually, the cooking time is the number of turns after the pot becomes full. So if the pot becomes full at turn t, then at turn t+5 it is ready.\n\nBut note: the pot becomes full when the third ingredient is added. That happens at the turn when the player interacts to add the ingredient. So if Bob adds the onion at turn 84 (since we are at turn 83 and we are planning from turn 83 onwards, but note that we are planning for the next H turns, starting at turn 83? Actually, the problem says: at turn t1 (83), plan a sequence of actions for the next several turns (H turns). So the actions we plan are for turn 83, 84, ... up to t1+H-1.\n\nWe are at turn 83. The current state is after turn 82? The action history for the players are the actions they took in the previous turns (at most 5). The next action we plan is for turn 83.\n\nSo let's break down:\n\nTurn 83: We plan actions for Alice and Bob? But note the task says: plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob). However, to maximize collaboration, we must consider both. But the answer format only shows one sequence? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". It might be that we are only to output Alice's actions? But then how do we coordinate? \n\nLooking at the answer format: it only shows one set of actions, labeled by turn. It does not specify for which player. But the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". This is ambiguous. However, in the context of the problem, we are controlling Alice and we can assume that Bob is controlled by another agent (perhaps the same system or a teammate). But the problem says \"help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we must plan for both? But the answer format only has one line per turn.\n\nRe-reading: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". And the answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nSo it seems we are only to output Alice's actions? But then how do we account for Bob? We can assume Bob is controlled by an independent agent? But the problem says \"collaborate\", so we must consider Bob's actions as well? \n\nHowever, note that the environment details and current state include Bob's state and action history. We are to optimize coordination. Therefore, we must plan for both players? But the answer format does not specify how to output Bob's actions.\n\nLooking again: the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". It might be that we are only required to output Alice's actions, but we can assume that Bob will act optimally? Or we can influence Bob by our plan? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we should plan for both players, but the output format only requires Alice's actions. However, the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we can also output Bob's actions? But the answer format does not have two lines per turn.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects only Alice's actions, and we assume Bob is controlled by a separate agent that we cannot control? But then we must predict Bob's actions to coordinate? \n\nGiven that Bob is holding an onion and the pot at (3,0) needs one onion, it is very likely that Bob will try to deliver that onion. We can see from Bob's action history: I, R, R, U, I. The last action was 'I' (interact). What did he interact with? He is at (3,3) and facing up. The tile above (3,3) is (3,4). What is at (3,4)? It's an onion dispenser. But he already has an onion? And he interacted? That doesn't make sense because if he is holding an onion and interacts with a dispenser, he cannot pick up another (since he can only hold one). Alternatively, there is a kitchen counter at (3,2) which is below (3,3). But he is facing up, so he can't interact with (3,2). The interaction requires facing the tile. So his last interaction might have been with (3,4) but that doesn't make sense because he already has an onion. Alternatively, he might have been at a different position? The action history might be from previous turns. But we don't have the full context.\n\nAlternatively, note that Bob's position is (3,3) and he is facing up. The tile above (3,3) is (3,4) which is an onion dispenser. If he interacted with it while holding an onion, nothing would happen? Or maybe he placed the onion on a counter? But there is no kitchen counter at (3,4). The kitchen counters are at the listed positions. (3,4) is an onion dispenser. So if Bob interacted with the onion dispenser while holding an onion, he would not be able to pick up another, so nothing would happen? \n\nAlternatively, maybe Bob was at (3,2) and then moved up? But his last actions were: I, R, R, U, I. The last action was I. Before that, U, then before that R, R, then I. So:\n\nLet's reconstruct Bob's recent moves (with the most recent last):\n\nAction History: I (last), then U, then R, then R, then I (first in the list?).\n\nBut the problem says: \"with the most recent action listed at the end of the array.\" So:\n\nIndex: 0: I (oldest), 1: R, 2: R, 3: U, 4: I (most recent).\n\nSo at turn 82 (the turn before current state at turn 83) Bob did I (interact). Then at turn 81 he did U (up), turn 80 R (right), turn 79 R (right), turn 78 I (interact).\n\nGiven that, it's unclear what he did. But we know his current state: at (3,3) holding an onion and facing up.\n\nNow, to complete the pot at (3,0) we need one onion. Bob has it. So Bob should go to (3,0) and add the onion.\n\nHow can Bob get to (3,0)? \n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,0): he needs to move down three times. But note the grid: we don't have a map of obstacles, but we know the tile types. The path must be through empty tiles? \n\nThe grid coordinates: \n- (3,3) is Bob's current position. \n- (3,2): kitchen counter (with an onion on it). So Bob cannot step on (3,2) because it's non-empty? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So Bob must avoid (3,2). Similarly, (3,1): what is at (3,1)? The environment does not list any non-empty tile at (3,1) except that we have the list of kitchen counters and dispensers. The kitchen counters are listed at specific positions. (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list, nor in any dispenser, pot, etc. So (3,1) is an empty tile? \n\nThe tile types:\n- Kitchen Counter: listed positions: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n- Onion Dispenser: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pot: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nSo (3,1) is not listed, so it is an empty tile? Similarly, (3,0) is a pot, so non-empty. Bob must be adjacent to (3,0) and facing it to interact.\n\nBob's path to (3,0): \nHe is at (3,3). He cannot go down to (3,2) because (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty). So he must go around.\n\nPossible route:\n- Move left to (2,3) -> but (2,3) is not listed as non-empty? It's not in the kitchen counter list? Actually, (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters. (2,3) is not listed, so it's empty. Then from (2,3) he can move down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> not walkable. Alternatively, from (2,3) move down to (2,2) is blocked, so he must go to (2,4)? But (2,4) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. \n\nAlternative: go right? From (3,3) move right to (4,3). (4,3) is not listed as non-empty -> empty. Then from (4,3) move down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So blocked.\n\nAlternatively, move up? But (3,4) is an onion dispenser (non-empty) so he cannot go up. \n\nSo Bob is stuck? But that can't be. There must be a path. \n\nLet me re-examine the grid layout. We don't have a full grid, but we can infer from the tile positions.\n\nThe kitchen counters are at (3,2) and (4,2) and (2,2) and (5,2) in the middle row. So row y=2 has kitchen counters at x=2,3,4,5. So Bob at (3,3) cannot go down to (3,2) because it's blocked. Similarly, he cannot go left to (2,3) and then down because (2,2) is blocked, and similarly right. \n\nBut note: (3,3) is at the top. The only way down is through the sides? \n\nLook at the left side: \n- (1,3): not listed as non-empty -> empty? \n- (0,3) is kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n\nSo from (3,3) Bob can move left to (2,3) -> but (2,3) is not listed? Then from (2,3) move left to (1,3) (empty). Then from (1,3) move down to (1,2) -> (1,2) is not listed? Then to (1,1) -> not listed? Then to (1,0) -> but (1,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. Then from (1,1) move right to (2,1) -> but (2,1) is Alice's current position? And at turn 83, Alice is at (2,1). So Bob cannot step on (2,1) if Alice is there? But we can plan to have Alice move away.\n\nAlternatively, right side: \nFrom (3,3) to (4,3) -> empty. Then to (5,3) -> not listed -> empty? Then to (5,2) -> kitchen counter -> blocked. Then from (5,3) down to (5,2) is blocked, so go to (5,4) -> kitchen counter? (5,4) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can drop his onion on a kitchen counter to free his hands? But then he can walk through the kitchen counters? No, the rules say players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. But even if the kitchen counter is empty, it is still a non-empty tile? No: the kitchen counter is a tile type. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that are occupied? Or the tile type is inherently non-walkable? \n\nThe tile types: \n- Empty Tile: walkable.\n- Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: are non-empty? But note the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? Or the tile type? \n\nLooking at the rules: \n- \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n- For other tiles, they are non-empty? But note the rules for interaction: the player must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the non-empty tile.\n\nSo the tile types like Dispenser, Pot, etc. are non-empty and cannot be walked on. Similarly, a kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? But the rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is a tile type. So I think they are non-walkable? \n\nBut then how do players move? They can only walk on empty tiles. \n\nSo the grid has:\n- Walkable: only empty tiles (not listed in any of the non-empty types).\n- Non-walkable: all the listed dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters (even if they don't have an item?).\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter is a tile type. It is always there. So even if it doesn't have an item, it is still a tile of type \"Kitchen Counter\", which is not an empty tile. Therefore, it is non-walkable.\n\nSo Bob is at (3,3). The adjacent tiles:\n- Up: (3,4) -> onion dispenser -> non-walkable.\n- Down: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n- Left: (2,3) -> not listed in any non-empty type -> empty? -> walkable.\n- Right: (4,3) -> not listed -> empty -> walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nFrom (2,3): \n- Down: (2,2) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Left: (1,3) -> not listed -> empty.\n- Up: (2,4) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nSo from (2,3) Bob can only go left to (1,3).\n\nFrom (1,3):\n- Down: (1,2) -> not listed -> empty.\n- Left: (0,3) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nFrom (1,2): \n- Down: (1,1) -> empty.\n- Right: (2,2) -> blocked.\n\nFrom (1,1): \n- Down: (1,0) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Right: (2,1) -> currently occupied by Alice? But at turn 83, Alice is at (2,1). So if Bob moves to (1,1), then to (2,1) he would need Alice to move.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,1) move right to (2,1) but only if Alice moves away.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go right from (1,2) to (2,2) is blocked, so no.\n\nSo the only way down is to go to (1,1) and then to (2,1) if Alice moves.\n\nBut Alice is at (2,1) and we control Alice. So we can have Alice move to let Bob pass? But Bob needs to get to the pot at (3,0). \n\nAlternatively, Bob can go the right way: \nFrom (3,3) to (4,3) -> empty.\nFrom (4,3): \n- Down: (4,2) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Right: (5,3) -> empty? (not listed) -> yes.\n\nFrom (5,3):\n- Down: (5,2) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Right: (6,3) -> not listed -> empty.\n- Up: (5,4) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nFrom (6,3): \n- Down: (6,2) -> not listed? The serving counter is at (7,2) and kitchen counters at (6,0) and (6,4). (6,2) is not listed -> empty.\n- Right: (7,3) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nFrom (6,2): \n- Down: (6,1) -> empty? \n- Left: (5,2) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Right: (7,2) -> serving counter -> non-walkable.\n\nFrom (6,1): \n- Down: (6,0) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Left: (5,1) -> empty?\n- Right: (7,1) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nFrom (5,1): \n- Down: (5,0) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Left: (4,1) -> empty.\n- Up: (5,2) -> blocked.\n\nFrom (4,1): \n- Down: (4,0) -> pot -> non-walkable.\n- Left: (3,1) -> empty.\n- Up: (4,2) -> blocked.\n\nFrom (3,1): \n- Down: (3,0) -> pot -> non-walkable.\n- Left: (2,1) -> occupied by Alice.\n- Right: (4,1) -> already visited.\n\nSo Bob can go via (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1). Then from (3,1) he can interact with the pot at (3,0) by facing down (since the pot is at (3,0) which is below (3,1)).\n\nBut note: to interact, he must be adjacent and facing the tile. So at (3,1) facing down, he can interact with (3,0).\n\nBut this path is very long: \n(3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1): 8 moves.\n\nThen at (3,1) he must face down and interact: total 9 turns.\n\nThat's too long. Alternatively, if we clear the path by having Alice move, we can have a shorter path on the left.\n\nAlternative plan: Bob drops the onion on a kitchen counter that is accessible, then moves freely to the pot area, but then we'd need someone to pick up the onion and bring it to the pot. But that might be even longer.\n\nBut note: there is a kitchen counter at (3,2) which is adjacent to Bob at (3,3). But Bob is facing up. He can change orientation to face down and interact with (3,2). But (3,2) has an onion already? The non-empty kitchen counters list includes (3,2): contains an onion. So the kitchen counter is occupied? Then Bob cannot place his onion there because the kitchen counter must be empty to place an item. The rules: \"Kitchen Counter: Pick up items (if player is empty-handed and counter is occupied) or place items (if player is holding an item and counter is empty).\" So Bob can only place his onion on an empty kitchen counter.\n\nAre there any empty kitchen counters? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed. There are many kitchen counters that are occupied by onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3). But are there any kitchen counters that are empty? The list of kitchen counter positions is long, but only the ones listed as \"contains\" are occupied. The others are empty? The environment says: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" and lists several. So the kitchen counters not mentioned are empty? \n\nThe environment says: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" and then lists specific ones with contents. The other kitchen counters (that are not listed) are empty? \n\nThe kitchen counter positions are: \n[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (0, 1), (7, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (0, 3), (7, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]\n\nBut only some are listed as non-empty (i.e., containing an onion). Specifically:\n- (5,2): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (6,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (0,3): onion\n\nSo the following kitchen counters are empty: \n(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nBob is at (3,3). The closest empty kitchen counter? For example, (0,3) is occupied, (2,4) is at (2,4) and empty? (2,4) is listed as a kitchen counter and not in the non-empty list? Actually, (2,4) is listed in the non-empty list? Wait, the non-empty list includes (2,4)? Let me check: \n\nThe non-empty kitchen counter list: \n\"Kitchen Counter on (5, 2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (5, 4): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (6, 0): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (2, 2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (3, 2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (4, 2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (0, 3): contains a onion;\"\n\nSo (2,4) is not in that list, so it is empty. Bob is at (3,3). (2,4) is at (2,4): which is adjacent? (3,3) to (2,4): not adjacent (it's diagonal). The adjacent are up, down, left, right. From (3,3) to (2,4): not adjacent.\n\nThe empty kitchen counters adjacent to Bob? \n- (3,2) is below but has an onion -> not empty.\n- (2,3) is not a kitchen counter? It's an empty tile.\n\nThe closest empty kitchen counter might be (2,4): from (3,3) Bob can go left to (2,3) (empty tile) and then up to (2,4) -> but (2,4) is a kitchen counter and empty? And it's adjacent? From (2,3) to (2,4) is up. (2,4) is a kitchen counter and empty, so he can step on it? No, because kitchen counters are non-walkable. But to interact, he must be adjacent and facing it. \n\nBob at (2,3) can face up and interact with (2,4) (which is empty) to place his onion.\n\nSo plan for Bob:\n\nAt turn 83: \n- Bob can move left to (2,3) (action L).\n- Then turn to face up (action U) [but note: the action to change orientation is U, but that doesn't move him, just changes orientation to up]. Then interact (I) to place the onion on (2,4).\n\nBut that uses two turns (turn 83: move left to (2,3), turn 84: change orientation to U, turn 85: interact to place onion). Then Bob is free to move to the pot area.\n\nBut now we have an onion at (2,4) and we still need to get an onion to the pot. Alice is free and closer to the pot? Alice is at (2,1) holding nothing. She can pick up the onion from (2,4) and deliver it to the pot? But (2,4) is at the top, and Alice is at (2,1) at the bottom. \n\nAlternatively, after Bob places the onion, he can then move to the pot. But without the onion, we need someone to bring an onion to the pot. \n\nGiven the complexity, let's reconsider the direct path for Bob to deliver the onion, with Alice moving out of the way.\n\nAlice is at (2,1). She can move away to let Bob pass through the left side.\n\nBob's path via left:\n- From (3,3) move left to (2,3) [turn 83]\n- Then left to (1,3) [turn 84]\n- Then down to (1,2) [turn 85]\n- Then down to (1,1) [turn 86]\n\nAt this point, Alice must have moved from (2,1) so that Bob can move to (2,1) on turn 87.\n\nThen from (2,1) Bob can move down to (2,0)? But (2,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he cannot go there. Alternatively, from (2,1) he can move right to (3,1) [turn 88], then face down and interact with the pot at (3,0) on turn 89.\n\nThis is 7 moves: turns 83 to 89.\n\nThen the pot becomes full at turn 89. It will cook for 5 turns, so ready at turn 94. Then someone must get a plate, pick up the soup, and deliver it.\n\nBut this is very long.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can help by getting a plate and being ready to serve.\n\nGiven the time constraints, it might be better to have Bob drop the onion at (2,4) and then have Alice go up to get it and bring it to the pot.\n\nAlice's current position: (2,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can move up to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must go around.\n\nAlice's path to (2,4):\n\n- From (2,1): move up is blocked. Move left to (1,1) [empty], then up to (1,2) [empty], then up to (1,3) [empty], then right to (2,3) [empty], then up to (2,4) -> but (2,4) is kitchen counter, so she cannot step on it. She must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n\nSo at (2,3) she can face up and interact with (2,4) to pick up the onion (if Bob has placed it there).\n\nThen she can bring the onion to the pot at (3,0). Path from (2,3) to (3,0): \n- From (2,3) move right to (3,3) [empty], then down to (3,2) is blocked. So she must go down via the right side or left side.\n\nThis is also long.\n\nGiven the time, the most efficient is to have Bob deliver the onion directly with Alice moving out of the way.\n\nPlan for turns 83 onward:\n\nTurn 83:\n- Alice moves right to (3,1) [to vacate (2,1) for Bob later]. But (3,1) is empty? Yes. So Alice: R (move right to (3,1)).\n- Bob: move left to (2,3) [action L].\n\nTurn 84:\n- Alice: to stay out of Bob's way, she can move down to (3,0)? But (3,0) is a pot -> non-walkable. She can move right to (4,1)? But (4,1) is empty. Or she can move down to (3,0) is not possible. So she can move right to (4,1) [action R].\n- Bob: move left to (1,3) [action L].\n\nTurn 85:\n- Alice: she can move down to (4,0)? But (4,0) is a pot -> non-walkable. Or move right to (5,1)? Or stay. But she doesn't have a clear task yet. We might have her get a plate for the future soup.\n- Bob: move down to (1,2) [action D].\n\nTurn 86:\n- Alice: let's have her go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). But she is at (4,1). Path to (0,2) is long. Alternatively, she can wait.\n- Bob: move down to (1,1) [action D].\n\nTurn 87:\n- Alice: ... \n- Bob: move right to (2,1) [action R] (because Alice has vacated it).\n\nTurn 88:\n- Alice: ...\n- Bob: move right to (3,1) [action R].\n\nTurn 89:\n- Alice: ...\n- Bob: change orientation to face down (action D) [because the pot is at (3,0), which is below him].\n- Then interact on the next turn.\n\nBut at turn 89, Bob is at (3,1) facing down. He can interact with the pot at (3,0) by using 'I' in turn 89? Or does he need to be at (3,1) and facing down, then interact in turn 89.\n\nSo at turn 89: Bob uses 'I' to add the onion to the pot. The pot then has 3 onions and cooking starts.\n\nThen the soup will be ready at turn 89 + 5 = 94.\n\nNow, while the soup is cooking, Alice can get a plate and be ready to serve.\n\nAlice is at some position. Let's have her get a plate from the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom turn 83: \n- Turn 83: Alice moves R to (3,1)\n- Turn 84: Alice moves R to (4,1)\n- Then she can move up to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So move right to (5,1) [empty] (turn 85: R)\n- Then up to (5,2) -> kitchen counter -> blocked. So move right to (6,1) [empty] (turn 86: R)\n- Then up to (6,2) [empty] (turn 87: U)\n- Then left to (5,2) is blocked. She needs to go to (0,2). This is inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,1) she can move left and up through the top.\n\nBut note there is a kitchen counter at (3,2) blocking the way.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps Alice should go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) via the bottom.\n\nFrom (2,1) originally, after moving to (3,1) at turn 83, then at turn 84 she can move down? But she is at (3,1), down is (3,0) -> pot -> not walkable. So she can only move left, right, or up.\n\nUp is (3,2) -> blocked. Left is (2,1) -> but Bob will be there later. Right is (4,1).\n\nSo she is stuck in the right side.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 83, Alice could move left to (1,1) instead of right.\n\nRevised plan for Alice and Bob:\n\nTurn 83:\n- Alice: move left to (1,1) [action L]. This vacates (2,1) and also moves her closer to the plate dispenser.\n- Bob: move left to (2,3) [action L].\n\nTurn 84:\n- Alice: move up to (1,2) [action U].\n- Bob: move left to (1,3) [action L].\n\nTurn 85:\n- Alice: move up to (1,3) -> but Bob is there at turn 84? At turn 84, Bob moves to (1,3), so at turn 85, Alice cannot move to (1,3) if Bob is there. Conflict.\n\nSo Alice should wait or move in a different direction.\n\nTo avoid conflict, at turn 84, after Alice is at (1,1), she can move down? (1,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked. Or right to (2,1) -> but that's the tile we vacated for Bob.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can move up to (1,2) at turn 83 immediately after moving left? But then at turn 84, she can move up to (1,3) only if Bob isn't there. But Bob will be moving to (1,3) at turn 84.\n\nSo they would be at (1,3) at the same time? Not allowed.\n\nTherefore, we need to sequence carefully.\n\nPerhaps Alice can let Bob go first and she does something else.\n\nGiven the challenges, I propose:\n\n- Let Bob drop the onion on an empty kitchen counter that is close to the pot, then have Alice pick it up and deliver it.\n\nFor example, there is an empty kitchen counter at (7,0)? But that's far. Or at (0,0) or (0,1).\n\nThe closest empty kitchen counter to the pot might be (0,0) or (1,0) or (2,0) or (7,0), but they are at the bottom.\n\nBob is at (3,3). He can move left to (2,3) and then face up to interact with (2,4) (empty kitchen counter) to place the onion.\n\nTurn 83:\n- Bob: move left to (2,3) [L].\n- Alice: she can start moving to (2,4) to pick up the onion after Bob places it. But she is at (2,1). She can move up? blocked. So move left to (1,1) [L].\n\nTurn 84:\n- Bob: change orientation to face up [U].\n- Alice: move up to (1,2) [U].\n\nTurn 85:\n- Bob: interact to place onion on (2,4) [I].\n- Alice: move up to (1,3) [U].\n\nTurn 86:\n- Bob: now free, he can start moving to the pot area, but we don't need him to.\n- Alice: move right to (2,3) [R]. (Bob was at (2,3) but moved away? At turn 85, after placing the onion, Bob is still at (2,3). So at turn 86, Alice cannot move to (2,3) if Bob is there.\n\nSo conflict.\n\nBob after placing the onion at turn 85, he can move away at turn 86.\n\nTurn 86:\n- Bob: move right to (3,3) [R].\n- Alice: move to (2,3) [R]? But she is at (1,3), so move right to (2,3) -> but Bob is moving to (3,3) at the same turn, so (2,3) is free.\n\nSo turn 86:\n- Alice: move right to (2,3) [R].\n- Bob: move right to (3,3) [R].\n\nThen turn 87:\n- Alice: change orientation to face up [U] (to face (2,4)).\n- Bob: ... \n\nTurn 88:\n- Alice: interact to pick up the onion from (2,4) [I].\n\nNow Alice has the onion at turn 88.\n\nThen she needs to deliver it to the pot at (3,0). From (2,3) to (3,0): \n- Move down to (2,2) is blocked. So she must go to (3,3) then to (3,2) is blocked. So again, the long way.\n\nThis is taking too many turns.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only to output Alice's actions, and H is not specified, but we want to complete the soup as soon as possible, I think the best is to have Alice help by getting a plate and being ready to serve the soup once it's cooked, while Bob delivers the onion.\n\nSo assume Bob will find a way to deliver the onion within the next few turns. We trust that Bob will do it optimally.\n\nThen, the soup will be ready 5 turns after the onion is delivered.\n\nAlice can spend her time getting a plate and being near the pot or the serving counter.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nAlice's current position: (2,1) holding nothing.\n\nPath to (0,2):\n- (2,1) -> (1,1) [L] -> (1,2) [U] -> (0,2) [L] but (0,2) is the plate dispenser, so she cannot walk on it. She must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n\nSo she can go to (0,1) or (1,2) and face the dispenser.\n\nFrom (2,1):\n- Turn 83: move left to (1,1) [L]\n- Turn 84: move up to (1,2) [U] (now at (1,2), which is empty)\n- Turn 85: change orientation to left [L] (facing west, towards (0,2))\n- Turn 86: interact [I] to grab a plate.\n\nNow she is holding a plate at turn 86.\n\nThen she can wait for the soup to be cooked.\n\nBut the soup is not cooking yet. We hope that by turn 86, Bob has delivered the onion.\n\nBob's delivery: if he delivers at turn 83,84, or 85, then the soup will be ready at turn 88,89, or 90.\n\nAlice can then go to the pot to pick up the soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to the pot at (3,0): \n- (1,2) -> (2,2) is blocked. So she must go down to (1,1) [D] (turn 87), then right to (2,1) [R] (turn 88), then down to (2,0) is blocked. So then right to (3,1) [R] (turn 89), then face down [D] (turn 90), then interact [I] to pick up the soup (turn 91).\n\nThen she must deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2): \n- Move right to (4,1) [R] (turn 92), then up to (4,2) blocked, so continue right to (5,1) [R] (turn 93), then up to (5,2) blocked, so right to (6,1) [R] (turn 94), then up to (6,2) [U] (turn 95), then face east to (7,2) [R] (turn 96), then interact [I] (turn 97).\n\nThis is very long.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate, Alice can move closer to the pot.\n\nBut the area around the pot is congested.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most efficient might be to have Alice deliver the onion that is on one of the kitchen counters. For example, there is an onion at (2,2) which is very close to Alice. But (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. Alice is at (2,1) and can face north to interact with (2,2) to pick up the onion. Then she can deliver it to the pot at (3,0).\n\nAlice's current state: at (2,1) holding nothing, facing up (orientation U).\n\nSo she is already facing (2,2)? (2,2) is above (2,1). So at turn 83, she can interact [I] to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nThen she has an onion.\n\nThen she can move to deliver it to the pot at (3,0).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,0): \n- She can move right to (3,1) [R] (turn 84).\n- Then face down [D] (turn 85).\n- Then interact [I] (turn 86) to add the onion to the pot.\n\nThen the pot becomes full at turn 86. Cooking starts. It will be ready at turn 86 + 5 = 91.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob has an onion, but we don't need it. He can deliver it to another pot or discard it, but there's only one recipe and one pot? There are two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). The state only mentions (3,0) having 2 onions. (4,0) is empty.\n\nSo after Alice delivers the onion to (3,0) at turn 86, the pot (3,0) is full and cooking.\n\nThen Alice can get a plate to serve the soup.\n\nShe is at (3,1) after turn 84 and at turn 86 she has delivered the onion, so she is empty-handed.\n\nShe can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) or use a plate from elsewhere.\n\nBut there is a plate dispenser only at (0,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (0,2): \n- Move left to (2,1) [L] (turn 87), then left to (1,1) [L] (turn 88), then up to (1,2) [U] (turn 89), then left to (0,2) is the dispenser, so she must interact from (1,2) facing west.\n\nSo at (1,2), turn 90: change orientation to left [L] (facing west).\nTurn 91: interact [I] to grab a plate.\n\nThen the soup is ready at turn 91. So she can then go to the pot to pick up the soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,0):\n- Move right to (2,2) is blocked. So move down to (1,1) [D] (turn 92), then right to (2,1) [R] (turn 93), then right to (3,1) [R] (turn 94), then face down [D] (turn 95), then interact [I] to pick up the soup (turn 96).\n\nThen deliver to (7,2) as before.\n\nThis is still long.\n\nAlternatively, after delivering the onion, Alice can get a plate and wait near the pot.\n\nFor example, after turn 86, Alice is at (3,1) empty-handed. \n- Turn 87: move to (4,1) [R]\n- Turn 88: move to (5,1) [R]\n- Turn 89: move to (6,1) [R]\n- Turn 90: move to (6,2) [U]\n- Then to the plate dispenser is far, so she can't.\n\nThere isn't a closer plate dispenser.\n\nSo the plan with Alice delivering the onion from (2,2) and then getting a plate is viable.\n\nAnd it uses the onion that is already close, so we don't need Bob's onion for this pot. Bob can use his onion for the other pot at (4,0) to start another soup.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\nTurn 83: Interact [I] to pick up the onion from (2,2) (since she is at (2,1) facing up, and (2,2) is above her and has an onion).\n\nThen turn 84: move right to (3,1) [R].\n\nTurn 85: change orientation to face down [D] (because the pot at (3,0) is below her).\n\nTurn 86: interact [I] to add the onion to the pot.\n\nNow the pot at (3,0) has 3 onions and cooking starts. It will be ready at turn 91.\n\nThen Alice needs to get a plate and be ready to serve.\n\nTurn 87: move left to (2,1) [L].\n\nTurn 88: move left to (1,1) [L].\n\nTurn 89: move up to (1,2) [U].\n\nTurn 90: change orientation to left [L] (facing west towards the plate dispenser at (0,2)).\n\nTurn 91: interact [I] to grab a plate.\n\nNow at turn 91, the soup is ready. Alice is at (1,2) holding a plate. She needs to go to the pot at (3,0) to pick up the soup.\n\nTurn 92: move down to (1,1) [D].\n\nTurn 93: move right to (2,1) [R].\n\nTurn 94: move right to (3,1) [R].\n\nTurn 95: change orientation to face down [D].\n\nTurn 96: interact [I] to pick up the soup (now she is holding the soup in a plate).\n\nThen she needs to deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nTurn 97: move right to (4,1) [R].\n\nTurn 98: move right to (5,1) [R].\n\nTurn 99: move right to (6,1) [R].\n\nTurn 100: move up to (6,2) [U].\n\nTurn 101: change orientation to face east [R] ( towards (7,2)).\n\nTurn 102: interact [I] to deliver the soup.\n\nThis yields a reward of 20.\n\nBut this is over 20 turns, and H might be defined, but the problem doesn't specify H. We are to plan for several turns.\n\nAlternatively, after having the plate, Alice can go directly to the serving counter? But she needs to pick up the soup first.\n\n Given the complexity, this is a plan.\n\nBut note: at turn 91 when the soup is ready, Alice is at (1,2) with a plate. She could go to the pot, but it's 5 steps away.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob might be able to serve the soup if he is closer. But Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He could deliver his onion to the other pot at (4,0) to start another soup, then get a plate and serve both.\n\nBut since we are only planning for Alice, we'll focus on her.\n\nSo Alice's actions for the next 20 turns (until she delivers the soup) might be too long, but the problem doesn't specify H. We can plan until she has delivered the soup.\n\nBut likely, we only need to plan for a limited horizon. The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", so H is given as \"several\", which is vague. Perhaps we can set H=10 or 20. But since the cooking takes 5 turns, we need at least until turn 91 for the soup to be ready, which is 8 turns from turn 83 (83 to 91 is 8 turns: turns 83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91 -> 9 turns).\n\nSo up to turn 91 is 8 turns (83 to 91 inclusive is 9 actions: turns 83 to 91).\n\nBut at turn 91, she has just grabbed the plate and the soup is ready, so she needs to go to the pot.\n\nPerhaps plan for 10 turns: turns 83 to 92.\n\nBut then at turn 92, she is at (1,1) moving down, not having picked up the soup.\n\nGiven the instructions, I think we should output Alice's actions for as long as necessary to complete the task, but the problem says \"maximize the total reward\", and this plan does deliver one soup.\n\n Bob might deliver his onion to the other pot, starting another cooking process, but that would be after our planning.\n\nFor now, we output Alice's actions for the next 10 turns or so.\n\nBut to be practical, let's output until she gets the plate and is about to go to the pot.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\nTurn 83: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 84: R (move to (3,1))\nTurn 85: D (face down to interact with (3,0))\nTurn 86: I (add onion to pot)\nTurn 87: L (move to (2,1))\nTurn 88: L (move to (1,1))\nTurn 89: U (move to (1,2))\nTurn 90: L (face west to interact with plate dispenser)\nTurn 91: I (grab plate)\nTurn 92: D (move to (1,1))\nTurn 93: R (move to (2,1))\nTurn 94: R (move to (3,1))\nTurn 95: D (face down to interact with pot)\nTurn 96: I (pick up soup)\n... and so on.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify H, and to keep it short, perhaps we can stop after she gets the plate at turn 91, but then she hasn't delivered.\n\nAlternatively, since the serving will take many turns, and we are at turn 91, we can output until turn 92 or 93.\n\nBut the immediate goal is to get the soup cooked and picked up.\n\n Given the instructions, I think we should output for a horizon of 10 turns, turns 83 to 92.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 83: I\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: I\nTurn 87: L\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: L\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: D\n\nThis has her at (1,1) holding a plate at turn 92.\n\nThen she would continue to the pot.\n\nBut this is a partial plan.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"maximize the total reward\", and with this plan we will get at least 20 reward, and it's the only recipe, it's acceptable.\n\n So I will output Alice's actions for turns 83 to 92.\n\nBut note: at turn 83, when she interacts to pick up the onion from (2,2), it must be that (2,2) has an onion, which it does according to the state.\n\nBob might do something else, but we can't control him.\n\nSo final answer for Alice:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 83: I\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: I\nTurn 87: L\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: L\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: D\n}\n\nThis is for 10 turns.\n\nTo make it until she has picked up the soup, we would need more turns, but the problem doesn't specify H.\n\nSo I think this is a reasonable plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should immediately use the onion on the kitchen counter at (2, 2) to complete the pot at (3, 0) with 3 onions, starting the cooking process. She will then fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0, 2) to be ready for serving the soup once cooked. The pot will be ready at turn 91 (5 turns after the onion is added at turn 86), and Alice will be positioned to collect and serve it afterward.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 83 to 92):\n- **Turn 83 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (2, 2). Alice is at (2, 1), facing up, and (2, 2) is adjacent and contains an onion.\n- **Turn 84 (R)**: Move right to (3, 1) to approach the pot.\n- **Turn 85 (D)**: Change orientation to face down (toward the pot at (3, 0)).\n- **Turn 86 (I)**: Interact to add the onion to the pot at (3, 0), completing the recipe and starting cooking (ready at turn 91).\n- **Turn 87 (L)**: Move left to (2, 1) to begin heading toward the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 88 (L)**: Move left to (1, 1).\n- **Turn 89 (U)**: Move up to (1, 2).\n- **Turn 90 (L)**: Change orientation to face left (toward the plate dispenser at (0, 2)).\n- **Turn 91 (I)**: Interact to grab a plate from the dispenser at (0, 2).\n- **Turn 92 (D)**: Move down to (1, 1) to start moving toward the pot for soup pickup.\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- Bob is holding an onion and can start cooking in the other pot at (4, 0) for additional reward. Alice's actions avoid conflicts, as Bob is in the upper area (starting at (3, 3)), and Alice operates in the lower/mid area. By the time Alice heads to the plate dispenser (turns 87+), Bob has ample time to navigate to (4, 0).\n\n### Expected Reward:\n- The soup in the pot at (3, 0) will yield a reward of 20 when served. Alice will pick it up at turn 96 (after moving to (3, 1), facing down, and interacting) and deliver it to (7, 2) shortly after.

We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob, but the task says \"for Alice\" and we are only required to output Alice's actions) over the next several turns (H turns). However, note that the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the answer format only shows one action per turn for Alice? Actually, the answer format only has one action per turn and it is labeled by turn, so I think we are only required to output Alice's actions. But note: we are allowed to plan for Bob optionally? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". However, the answer format only has one action per turn. So it seems we are only to output Alice's actions. But we must consider Bob's actions as well because they affect the state? However, we cannot control Bob directly. The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\". But we are only planning for Alice. So we assume that Bob is an independent agent and we have to plan for Alice in a way that coordinates with Bob's expected behavior.\n\nBut note: we are given Bob's action history and state. We can use that to predict what Bob might do. However, the task does not require us to output Bob's actions, only Alice's.\n\nGiven the current state:\n\n- Alice: at (3,1), facing right, holding one onion.\n- Bob: at (6,3), facing right, holding one onion.\n\nThe pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and 0 tomatoes, so it needs one more onion to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). Then it can be served.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). There is a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlso, there are several kitchen counters with onions: \n  (5,2): onion\n  (5,4): onion\n  (6,0): onion\n  (3,2): onion\n  (4,2): onion\n  (0,3): onion\n\nBut note: the pot only needs one more onion. So if Alice (or Bob) adds an onion to the pot at (3,0), then the cooking will start.\n\nAlice is holding an onion and is at (3,1). The pot is at (3,0). To interact with the pot, Alice must be adjacent to it and facing it. Currently, Alice is at (3,1) and facing right (so east). The pot is at (3,0) which is south of her? Actually, the grid: (3,1) is above (3,0). So (3,0) is directly below Alice.\n\nBut note: orientation matters. Alice is facing right (east). The pot is south of her. So she is not facing the pot. Therefore, she cannot interact with the pot right now.\n\nOptions for Alice:\n1. Turn to face down (so she can interact with the pot below her). Then she can add her onion to the pot. But note: the pot will then have 3 onions and start cooking (5 turns). Then the pot will be cooking and we can serve it later.\n\nBut note: Bob is at (6,3) holding an onion. What is Bob likely to do? Bob's action history: U, I, R, R, R. The most recent actions: R, R, R. He is at (6,3) facing right. To the right of (6,3) is (7,3). What is at (7,3)? It's a kitchen counter. But note: the serving counter is at (7,2). So (7,3) is a kitchen counter. He might be planning to put his onion on that kitchen counter? Or maybe he is heading to the pot? The pot at (3,0) and (4,0) are far.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might be heading to the serving counter? But he is holding an onion, not a plate or soup.\n\nLet me map the positions:\n\nGrid layout (from the tile types):\n\n- The kitchen counters are at: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nSo the grid is 8x5? (x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4) or 8x5? Actually, the positions go up to (7,4).\n\nAlice at (3,1) and pot at (3,0) is directly below her.\n\nBob at (6,3) and he is facing right. The tile to his right is (7,3) which is a kitchen counter. So he might be about to place his onion on (7,3)? But (7,3) is a kitchen counter and currently not occupied? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3). So (7,3) is empty? Then Bob can place his onion there.\n\nAlternatively, he might be heading to the serving counter at (7,2) but he is holding an onion and the serving counter only accepts soup. So he can't deliver.\n\nGiven Bob's recent actions: he moved up, then interacted (I), then moved right three times. The interaction might have been picking up an onion from a dispenser or from a kitchen counter? But we don't see the previous state. However, we know that at (6,3) he is facing right and about to interact with (7,3) if he does 'I'. So it's likely that on the next turn Bob will do 'I' to place his onion on (7,3). But we cannot be sure. However, we must plan for Alice independently.\n\nGoal: maximize the total reward. The only recipe we know is 3 onions (reward 20). The pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and needs one more. So if Alice adds her onion, then the pot will start cooking. Then after 5 turns (starting at turn 87 if we add at turn 86? Actually, we are at turn 86 and we are planning from turn 86 onwards. But note: the current state is at the beginning of turn 86? The problem says \"at turn t1\", so we are about to decide the action for turn t1 (86).\n\nSo at turn 86, we decide Alice's action.\n\nAfter we add the onion, the pot will start cooking at that moment (if the third onion is added). Then we have to wait 5 turns. Then the soup will be ready. Then someone must get a plate, pick up the soup, and deliver it.\n\nBut note: there is already an onion on (3,2) and (4,2) and others. So we have plenty of onions. We don't need to get more from the dispenser for now.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n\nStep 1: Alice should add her onion to the pot at (3,0). But she is at (3,1) facing right. She needs to face down to interact with (3,0). So:\n- Turn 86: change orientation to down (D? But note: the actions are U, D, L, R for movement and also for changing orientation? Actually, the actions are: Move (which changes position and orientation) or Change Orientation (which only changes orientation without moving). But note the action set: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. The problem says:\n  - Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\n  - Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is confusing. Actually, the problem states two ways to change orientation:\n\n1. Move: when you move, you change your position and your orientation becomes the direction you moved.\n2. Change Orientation: you stay in place and change your orientation to the specified direction, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? Actually, the description: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This seems to be a condition for when you try to move? Let me re-read:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThat sentence is ambiguous. Actually, the section is:\n\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The change orientation action should not move. The condition \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" seems misplaced. I think it's a typo. Actually, in the Interact description, it says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo for changing orientation, it should be: you can change your orientation without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles? But the problem states: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This might mean that if you try to change orientation to a direction where the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move? But changing orientation doesn't move anyway.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me read the original problem again:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. In standard Overcooked, changing orientation doesn't require the adjacent tile to be empty. It just changes the direction you are facing. So I think the condition is misplaced. Probably, the condition applies to the move action: when you try to move in a direction, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty (i.e., not walkable), then you don't move? But the problem says for move: it changes position and orientation, without any condition? Actually, the constraints say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if you try to move into a non-empty tile, you don't move.\n\nBut for change orientation, it should be unconditional: you change your orientation without moving.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the change orientation action is unconditional: it only changes the orientation and does not move. And the condition about adjacent tile applies only to movement (if you try to move and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move and maybe don't change orientation? But the problem says for move: it changes position and orientation. So if you cannot move because the tile is blocked, then you don't move and your orientation doesn't change? That's typical.\n\nSo for Alice: she is at (3,1) and wants to face down. She can do the change orientation action: D (which means change orientation to down). So at turn 86, Alice does 'D' (change orientation to down). Then she will be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nThen at turn 87, she can do 'I' to interact with the pot (which is at (3,0) below her). Then she will add her onion to the pot. Then the pot will have 3 onions and start cooking. The cooking will start at turn 87? Actually, the moment the third ingredient is added, the cooking starts. So the pot will be cooking at the end of turn 87.\n\nThen the soup will be ready at turn 87 + 5 = turn 92.\n\nMeanwhile, we need to get a plate and then serve the soup.\n\nBut note: there is a plate dispenser at (0,2). Also, we have kitchen counters that we can use to hold items.\n\nNow, what about Bob? Bob is at (6,3) facing right. He is holding an onion. He might be about to place it on (7,3) (a kitchen counter) because (7,3) is empty? Then he would do 'I' at turn 86 to place his onion on (7,3). Then he would be free.\n\nBut we don't control Bob. We have to plan for Alice.\n\nAfter Alice adds the onion, she is at (3,1) holding nothing. Then she can go to get a plate.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). So she needs to go from (3,1) to (0,2). The path: \n- (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2). But (0,1) is a kitchen counter? And (0,2) is the plate dispenser.\n\nBut note: (0,1) is a kitchen counter and it is currently empty? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed, and (0,1) is not in that list. So it's empty. So she can walk through (0,1) to (0,2) but note: to interact with the plate dispenser, she must be adjacent and facing it. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). She can stand at (0,1) and face up? Because (0,2) is above (0,1). Or stand at (1,2) and face left? But (1,2) is a kitchen counter? (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are: (0,0), (1,0), ... (2,2) is a kitchen counter, but (1,2) is not listed? So (1,2) is an empty tile? Let me check the kitchen counter list:\n\nKitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)]\n\nSo (1,2) is not a kitchen counter -> so it's an empty tile? Actually, the tile types: only the listed ones are kitchen counters. The rest are either empty or other types. The other types we know: dispensers, pot, serving counter, which are listed separately. So (1,2) is an empty tile? Then Alice can go to (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2) (the plate dispenser). Alternatively, she can go to (0,1) and face up to interact with (0,2). But (0,1) is a kitchen counter? And the problem says: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. But (0,1) is a kitchen counter and it is empty (since it's not listed as non-empty). So she can walk on (0,1) because it's a kitchen counter that is currently empty? But the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" Here, the tile is empty (no item on it) so it's walkable? The rule: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it's a tile type. But the constraint says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning tiles that are occupied by an item? Or tiles that are of a type that is not empty? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The problem says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the other tiles (dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are non-empty? But the constraint says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So non-empty tiles are those that are not empty tiles? Then dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? Then players cannot walk on them.\n\nSo Alice cannot walk on (0,1) because it is a kitchen counter (non-empty tile). Similarly, (0,2) is a plate dispenser (non-empty) and (0,0) is kitchen counter, etc.\n\nTherefore, the only way to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2) is from an adjacent empty tile. The adjacent tiles to (0,2) are:\n- Left: none (x<0)\n- Right: (1,2) -> which is not in any non-empty tile list? So it's an empty tile? \n- Down: (0,1) -> kitchen counter (non-empty, so cannot stand on it)\n- Up: (0,3) -> kitchen counter (and it has an onion, so non-empty? But even if empty, we cannot stand on it because it's a kitchen counter).\n\nSo the only accessible adjacent tile to (0,2) is (1,2). So Alice must go to (1,2) and face left to interact with the plate dispenser.\n\nSo path for Alice from (3,1) to (1,2):\n- From (3,1): move left to (2,1) -> empty? (2,1) is not in any non-empty tile? It's an empty tile? Yes.\n- Then from (2,1) to (1,1): move left -> (1,1): is it empty? Not in non-empty list -> empty.\n- Then from (1,1) to (1,2): move up -> (1,2): empty.\n\nThen at (1,2) she can face left (so change orientation to left) and then interact to get a plate.\n\nBut note: at (1,2) she is adjacent to (0,2) and facing it, so she can interact.\n\nSo after adding the onion to the pot (at turn 87), Alice will be at (3,1) holding nothing. Then:\n\nTurn 88: Alice moves left to (2,1)\nTurn 89: Alice moves left to (1,1)\nTurn 90: Alice moves up to (1,2)\nTurn 91: Alice changes orientation to left (so 'L' for change orientation? But the action set: L can be move or change orientation? The problem says we have two types of actions: move and change orientation, but the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. How do we distinguish between move and change orientation? \n\nThis is a critical point. The problem states two distinct actions: Move and Change Orientation, but they are both represented by the same letter? That is ambiguous.\n\nLooking back: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can: Move (L/R/U/D) ... Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) ... Interact (I) ... Stay (S).\"\n\nSo the actions are labeled by the direction for both move and change orientation? But how does the game know if it's a move or a change orientation? \n\nIn standard Overcooked, you have a separate button for interact and for movement. Movement also changes orientation. But if you try to move into a wall, you don't move and your orientation changes? Or not? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Typically, in such games, the same directional input is used for movement: if you press a direction, you move in that direction (if possible) and change orientation. If you cannot move, then you just change orientation? But the problem lists \"Change Orientation\" as a separate action.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I must assume that the action set is:\n\n- U: if it's a move, then move up. But if the player wants to change orientation to up without moving, how? The problem has a separate \"Change Orientation\" action. So how is it represented? The answer format only has one letter per action.\n\nThis is a problem. The problem says: \"each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\)\". So U, D, L, R can mean either move or change orientation? But that is ambiguous.\n\nLooking at the action history of Alice: \"U, U, I, R, I\". The last action was I (interact). The one before was R. What did that R do? It moved her to the right? Or changed orientation to right? We see that she is at (3,1) and facing right. So the R action must have been a move to the right? But she was at (2,1) before? Or a change orientation? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think we must assume that the directional actions are moves when possible and if not possible, they might change orientation? But the problem states two separate actions. Alternatively, perhaps the game engine interprets a directional input as:\n\n- If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable, then move and change orientation to that direction.\n- Else, just change orientation to that direction.\n\nThis is common in grid games. So I will assume that:\n\n- When a player issues a directional action (U, D, L, R), the player will move in that direction if the adjacent tile in that direction is an empty tile (walkable). If not, then the player will just change their orientation to that direction.\n\nThis matches the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nSo for Alice at (3,1) facing down (after we change orientation at turn 86 to down) and then at turn 87 she does 'I' to interact with the pot below.\n\nThen at turn 88: she is at (3,1) holding nothing. She wants to go to (2,1). (2,1) is left of (3,1). So she issues 'L'. Then she moves left to (2,1) and faces left.\n\nTurn 89: from (2,1) to (1,1): issue 'L' again -> moves to (1,1) and faces left.\n\nTurn 90: from (1,1) to (1,2): she needs to go up. So issue 'U'. Then she moves to (1,2) and faces up.\n\nBut then at (1,2) she is not facing the plate dispenser (which is at (0,2) to her left). So she needs to face left. So turn 91: issue 'L'. Since the tile to the left (0,2) is a dispenser (non-empty), she cannot move. So she just changes orientation to left. Now she is at (1,2) facing left.\n\nTurn 92: she can do 'I' to grab a plate from the dispenser (if she is empty-handed). She is holding nothing, so she gets a plate.\n\nBut note: the soup will be ready at turn 92? Let me recount:\n\n- Turn 86: Alice changes orientation to down (so action 'D'? But wait, if she does 'D', and the tile below (3,0) is a pot (non-empty), then she cannot move down? So if she does 'D' at turn 86, since the tile below is non-empty, she doesn't move and just changes orientation to down? That is what we want.\n\nSo turn 86: Alice does 'D' -> changes orientation to down (without moving).\n\nThen turn 87: Alice does 'I' -> interacts with the pot below. She adds her onion. Now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking. The cooking starts at the end of turn 87? So the soup will be ready at turn 87 + 5 = turn 92.\n\nNow, at turn 92, the soup is ready. Alice is at (1,2) holding a plate (from turn 92? Actually, we planned that at turn 92 she does 'I' to get the plate. So at the end of turn 92, she has the plate. But the soup is ready at the beginning of turn 92? Or at the end of turn 91? The problem doesn't specify the timing.\n\nTypically, the state update happens after the actions. So at turn 87: Alice interacts and adds the onion -> the pot now has 3 onions and the cooking starts. Then during the state update, the cooking timer is set to 5. Then at the end of each turn, the cooking time decreases. So:\n\n- End of turn 87: cooking timer = 5 -> becomes 4\n- End of turn 88: 3\n- End of turn 89: 2\n- End of turn 90: 1\n- End of turn 91: 0 -> soup is ready at the beginning of turn 92.\n\nSo at turn 92, the soup is ready.\n\nNow, Alice is at (1,2) with a plate. She needs to go to the pot at (3,0) to pick up the soup.\n\nPath from (1,2) to (3,0):\n- (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0)\n\nBut note: (2,2) is a kitchen counter? And it is non-empty? The non-empty kitchen counters include (3,2) and (4,2) and (5,2). But (2,2) is also a kitchen counter? The kitchen counter list: (2,2) is present. And the non-empty kitchen counters: we have (3,2) and (4,2) listed, but (2,2) is not listed as non-empty? So it is empty? Then we can walk through? But we cannot walk on kitchen counters because they are non-empty tiles? Wait, the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning tiles that are of a type that is not empty (like kitchen counter, dispenser, etc.)? Or tiles that have an item? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is a tile type. So the tile (2,2) is a kitchen counter tile, which is non-empty (in terms of tile type) -> so we cannot walk on it.\n\nTherefore, we must go around? How?\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0). But (3,1) is empty? (we were there). (2,1) is empty? (we were there). (1,1) is empty.\n\nBut (3,0) is a pot, which is non-empty -> we cannot walk on it. So we must be adjacent to interact.\n\nSo Alice must go to (3,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (3,0).\n\nSo:\n\nAfter turn 92: Alice has the plate at (1,2). Then:\n\nTurn 93: move down to (1,1) -> action 'D'\nTurn 94: move right to (2,1) -> action 'R'\nTurn 95: move right to (3,1) -> action 'R'\n\nNow at (3,1), she is facing right (because the last move was right). But she needs to face down to interact with the pot. So turn 96: change orientation to down -> action 'D' (which will change orientation to down without moving, because the tile below is non-empty).\n\nThen turn 97: interact 'I' to pick up the soup? But wait: she is holding a plate. When she interacts with a pot that has a cooked soup, and she is holding a plate, then she serves the soup? Actually, no: the interaction with pot when holding a plate and the pot has cooked soup: the effect is to serve the soup? But no, the problem says for pot: \"Serve soup (if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup).\" -> So it serves the soup? But serving the soup means delivering it? Actually, no. The serving counter is for delivery. For the pot, when you have a plate and the soup is cooked, you can take the soup by interacting? But the problem says: \"Add ingredient (if pot is not full and player is holding ingredient)\" and \"Serve soup (if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup)\". So \"serve soup\" here means putting the soup from the pot into the plate? Then the player now holds the soup in a plate. Then you have to deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nSo after interacting with the pot while holding a plate and the pot has cooked soup, the player picks up the soup (now holding a soup in plate) and the pot becomes empty.\n\nThen you must take the soup to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nSo after turn 97, Alice is holding the soup. Then she must go to (7,2) to deliver.\n\nPath from (3,1) to (7,2): \n- (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (7,1) -> then to (7,2). But (7,1) is a kitchen counter? And it is not listed as non-empty? So we can walk on it? No, because it's a kitchen counter (non-empty tile type) -> cannot walk on it.\n\nAlternative: (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2) -> (6,2) -> (7,2). But (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are kitchen counters and non-empty? They are listed as non-empty: (3,2) has an onion, (4,2) has an onion, (5,2) has an onion. So we cannot walk on them.\n\nHow about going up? (3,1) is at y=1. We can go to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and has an item -> non-empty -> cannot walk.\n\nSo we must go around the kitchen counters? \n\nThe grid: \nRow y=0: kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0); pots at (3,0), (4,0)\nRow y=1: kitchen counters at (0,1), (7,1); and (3,1) is empty? (since not listed as non-empty tile type? But it's an empty tile). Similarly, (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are empty? But we cannot go to (7,1) because it's a kitchen counter.\n\nRow y=2: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2); and plate dispenser at (0,2); serving counter at (7,2). So the only empty tiles in row y=2 are (1,2) and (6,2)? (6,2) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). (6,2) is not listed -> so it's empty? And (7,2) is serving counter.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), we can go to (6,2) and then face right to interact with (7,2).\n\nPath from (3,1) to (6,2):\n- (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> then up to (6,2). But (6,1) is empty? And (6,2) is empty? Then at (6,2) we face right and interact.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter picking up the soup at turn 97 (at (3,1)), Alice is at (3,1) holding soup.\n\nTurn 98: move right to (4,1) -> 'R'\nTurn 99: move right to (5,1) -> 'R'\nTurn 100: move right to (6,1) -> 'R'\nTurn 101: move up to (6,2) -> 'U' (now facing up? But we need to face right for (7,2))\nAt (6,2), she is facing up. So turn 102: change orientation to right -> 'R' (since the tile to the right (7,2) is non-empty, she doesn't move and changes orientation to right).\nTurn 103: interact 'I' to deliver the soup.\n\nBut this is very long. And we are only planning for several turns? The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We don't have a fixed H. But we must output a sequence. We can plan until the delivery? Or until a certain point.\n\nBut note: the reward is obtained when the soup is delivered. So we want to deliver as soon as possible.\n\nBut we also have Bob. Bob might be able to help. For example, Bob could get the plate and serve the soup. But we don't control Bob.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice adds the onion, she can get the plate and then wait near the pot until the soup is ready. Then she can pick it up and deliver.\n\nBut the path to get the plate is long (to (0,2)) and then back. And then to deliver to (7,2) is also long.\n\nBut Bob is at (6,3) at turn 86. If Bob places his onion on (7,3) at turn 86 (if he does 'I'), then he is free. He could then go to get a plate and then serve the soup.\n\nBut we cannot rely on Bob. So we must plan for Alice to do the entire task.\n\nHowever, to maximize reward, we might want to start another soup? But there is only one recipe: 3 onions. And we have two pots. The pot at (4,0) is empty. But we don't have tomatoes, only onions. The recipe requires 3 onions. So we can make another soup in the other pot.\n\nBut we have many onions on the counters. So after Alice starts the first soup, she can start another one in the other pot.\n\nBut the first soup will be ready at turn 92. If we start another soup, it will take 5 turns to cook, so ready at turn 92+5=97, and then we have to deliver it.\n\nBut we have to deliver the first soup first.\n\nGiven the time, let's plan for Alice to complete the first soup delivery.\n\nBut the sequence we have is:\n\nTurn 86: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 87: I (add onion to pot at (3,0))\nTurn 88: L (move left to (2,1))\nTurn 89: L (move left to (1,1))\nTurn 90: U (move up to (1,2))\nTurn 91: L (change orientation to left, because at (1,2) we want to face the plate dispenser at (0,2); since we are at (1,2) and we do 'L', and the left is (0,2) which is non-empty, so we don't move and change orientation to left)\nTurn 92: I (grab a plate)\nTurn 93: D (move down to (1,1))\nTurn 94: R (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 95: R (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 96: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 97: I (pick up the soup from the pot) -> now holding soup\nTurn 98: R (move right to (4,1))\nTurn 99: R (move right to (5,1))\nTurn 100: R (move right to (6,1))\nTurn 101: U (move up to (6,2))\nTurn 102: R (change orientation to right)\nTurn 103: I (deliver the soup)\n\nBut this is 18 turns (from turn 86 to 103). And we get one soup delivered.\n\nBut note: at turn 92, the soup is ready, but we are at (1,2) and we grab the plate at turn 92. Then we start moving back. We don't pick up the soup until turn 97. Meanwhile, the soup is ready at turn 92, so it's waiting. But no problem.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nAlternative: after adding the onion, Alice goes to get a plate, but then instead of coming back to (3,1), she can wait at (3,1) or nearby. But the path is fixed.\n\nAnother idea: use an existing plate? But there is no plate available. The plate dispenser is the only source.\n\nOr, have Bob get the plate and bring it to the pot. But we don't control Bob.\n\nBob is at (6,3) at turn 86. If he places his onion on (7,3) at turn 86 (action 'I'), then he is free. Then he could go to (0,2) to get a plate. The path for Bob: (6,3) to (0,2) is long. He would have to go left to (0,3) but (0,3) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> cannot walk. So he must go via (6,2) if it's empty? (6,2) is empty. So:\n\nBob at (6,3):\nTurn 86: I (place onion on (7,3)) -> now holding nothing.\nTurn 87: U (to (6,2))? But (6,2) is empty -> yes, move up to (6,2)\nTurn 88: L (to (5,2)) but (5,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> cannot walk. So he must go down? Or left via other rows.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (0,2):\n- (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> then face left to get plate.\n\nBut (6,2) to (6,1): move down -> 'D'\nThen (6,1) to (5,1): move left -> 'L'\nThen (5,1) to (4,1): 'L'\nThen (4,1) to (3,1): 'L'\nThen (3,1) to (2,1): 'L'\nThen (2,1) to (1,1): 'L'\nThen (1,1) to (1,2): 'U'\nThen at (1,2), face left: 'L' (change orientation)\nThen interact: 'I'\n\nSo Bob would take 9 turns to get to (1,2) and get the plate at turn 86+9=95. Then he has to go to the pot at (3,0). From (1,2) to (3,0): \n- (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> then face down to interact with (3,0).\n\nTurns: \nTurn 95: at (1,2) after getting plate, then move down to (1,1): 'D'\nTurn 96: move right to (2,1): 'R'\nTurn 97: move right to (3,1): 'R'\nTurn 98: change orientation down: 'D'\nTurn 99: interact to get the soup: 'I' -> now holding soup.\n\nThen he has to deliver to (7,2). From (3,1) to (7,2): as before, about 7 turns. Total for Bob: 9 (to get plate) + 5 (to get soup) + 7 (to deliver) = 21 turns from turn 86.\n\nBut Alice can do it in 18 turns? So it's faster for Alice to do it.\n\nBut we are only planning for Alice. And we don't know what Bob will do. So we must have Alice do the delivery.\n\nHowever, if Bob helps, they can do it faster. For example, Alice gets the plate and Bob picks up the soup. But at turn 92, when the soup is ready, Alice is at (1,2) with the plate. She is far. Bob could be near the pot.\n\nBob starts at (6,3). If after placing his onion, he goes to the pot area, he could be at (3,1) by turn 89 or so. Then at turn 92, he is there and can pick up the soup if he has a plate. But he doesn't have a plate. Alice has the plate. So they must meet to transfer the plate? But the game does not allow item transfer between players directly. They have to use a kitchen counter.\n\nSo one could put the plate on a kitchen counter, and the other picks it up. But that takes extra steps.\n\nGiven the complexity and that we only control Alice, we will stick to the plan of Alice doing the entire chain.\n\nBut we can make a shorter plan? We only need to output a sequence for Alice for the next several turns. We don't have to go until delivery. The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H=10 or so. But the reward is only obtained at delivery, so we might want to plan until delivery.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify H. We can output a sequence that makes progress.\n\nHowever, to maximize the total reward, we might want to start a second soup as well.\n\nAfter Alice adds the onion at turn 87, she is free. She can then get another onion (from a dispenser or from a counter) and put it in the other pot at (4,0). But the other pot is empty. So she can start a second soup.\n\nBut she is at (3,1). The onion dispenser is at (3,4) and (4,4). Or she can pick up an onion from a kitchen counter, e.g., (3,2) which is adjacent to (3,1)? (3,2) is above (3,1). So at (3,1) she can face up and interact to pick up the onion from (3,2) if it's a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\nYes, (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So:\n\nAfter turn 87: Alice at (3,1) holding nothing.\nTurn 88: U (change orientation to up? But she is at (3,1), and (3,2) is above. If she does 'U', she will move up to (3,2) if it is empty? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot walk. So she will just change orientation to up.\nThen turn 89: I to pick up the onion from (3,2).\nNow she is holding an onion.\nThen she can go to the pot at (4,0). From (3,1) to (4,0): \n- (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then face down to (4,0).\nTurn 90: R (move right to (4,1))\nTurn 91: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 92: I (add onion to pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has one onion. It needs two more.\n\nThen she can get more onions. But this will take time.\n\nAlternatively, she can use the onions on the counters. But she has to make multiple trips.\n\nBut the first soup will be ready at turn 92. If she is busy with the second soup, she might not be able to deliver the first one.\n\nBob might deliver the first soup. But he is not controlled.\n\nSo perhaps the best is to have Alice deliver the first soup and then start a second one.\n\nBut the delivery takes until turn 103. Then she can start a second soup.\n\nAlternatively, after she gets the plate at turn 92, she can head back to the pot. But while she is heading back, the soup is ready at turn 92, so she can pick it up at turn 97.\n\nThen after delivery, she can start a new soup.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think the initial plan is reasonable.\n\nBut to output a sequence, we can output for the next 10 turns or until the soup is picked up, etc.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify H, so we can choose a moderate H. Let's output 10 turns: from turn 86 to 95.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 86: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 87: I (interact with pot to add onion)\nTurn 88: L (move left to (2,1))\nTurn 89: L (move left to (1,1))\nTurn 90: U (move up to (1,2))\nTurn 91: L (change orientation to left)\nTurn 92: I (grab a plate)\nTurn 93: D (move down to (1,1))\nTurn 94: R (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 95: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nThen at turn 95, she is at (3,1) with the plate. The soup is ready (since ready at turn 92). She can then face down and pick up the soup.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 95 she is at (3,1) and we didn't change orientation yet.\n\nSo after turn 95, she would do:\nTurn 96: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 97: I (pick up soup)\n\nBut we only output until turn 95? Or we can output more.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify H, I'll output 10 actions: turns 86 to 95.\n\nBut 10 actions would be from turn 86 to turn 95 (10 turns? 86 to 95 is 10 actions: 86,87,...,95).\n\nSo 10 actions.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 86: D\nTurn 87: I\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: I\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: R\n}\n\nNote: at turn 91: L at (1,2) -> since left is non-empty, it changes orientation to left without moving.\n\nAt turn 92: I at (1,2) facing left to (0,2) -> grabs a plate.\n\nThen she moves down, right, right.\n\nThis gets her to (3,1) with the plate by turn 95.\n\nThen she can face down and interact in the next turns.\n\nThis is a good plan to get the plate and return to the pot area.\n\nIf we want to be more efficient, we might have her get the plate and then go directly to the serving counter? But she needs to pick up the soup first.\n\nSo this seems reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should focus on completing the onion soup in the pot at (3, 0) and delivering it. The pot currently has 2 onions and needs one more to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). Alice is holding an onion and is adjacent to the pot but not facing it. After adding the onion, Alice should fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0, 2) and return to the pot area to serve and deliver the soup. The planned sequence for Alice for the next 10 turns (turns 86 to 95) is optimized for this objective, considering the grid layout and constraints.\n\n- **Turn 86 (D)**: Alice changes orientation to down (facing the pot at (3, 0)) without moving, as the tile below is non-empty.\n- **Turn 87 (I)**: Alice interacts with the pot, adding her onion. The pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (will be ready at turn 92).\n- **Turn 88 (L)**: Alice moves left to (2, 1) (facing left).\n- **Turn 89 (L)**: Alice moves left to (1, 1) (facing left).\n- **Turn 90 (U)**: Alice moves up to (1, 2) (facing up).\n- **Turn 91 (L)**: Alice changes orientation to left (facing the plate dispenser at (0, 2)) without moving, as the left tile is non-empty.\n- **Turn 92 (I)**: Alice interacts with the plate dispenser, grabbing a plate (soup is now ready at (3, 0)).\n- **Turn 93 (D)**: Alice moves down to (1, 1) (facing down).\n- **Turn 94 (R)**: Alice moves right to (2, 1) (facing right).\n- **Turn 95 (R)**: Alice moves right to (3, 1) (facing right).\n\nAfter turn 95, Alice is at (3, 1) holding a plate, positioned to face down and interact with the pot to pick up the cooked soup on turn 96, then deliver it to the serving counter at (7, 2). This sequence ensures timely completion of the soup (reward: 20) and sets up for delivery. Coordination with Bob is considered implicitly; Bob is likely to place his onion on the kitchen counter at (7, 3) and may assist with future tasks, but Alice's actions are prioritized for immediate reward.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 86: D\nTurn 87: I\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: I\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 89. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nKey elements:\n- Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n- There is a pot at (3,0) that already has 2 onions and 0 tomatoes (so it needs one more onion to start cooking).\n- Alice is at (4,1) holding an onion, facing down (D).\n- Bob is at (4,3) holding nothing, facing left (L).\n\nOther items:\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- Serving counter at (7,2).\n- Several kitchen counters with onions: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3). Note that (3,2) and (4,2) are also kitchen counters and have onions.\n\nSince the pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and we need 3 to start cooking, we can complete it by adding one more onion. Alice is holding an onion and is at (4,1). The pot is at (3,0). How can she get there?\n\nAlice's current position: (4,1) facing down. The pot is at (3,0). To get to the pot, she needs to move left to (3,1) and then down to (3,0)? But note: (3,0) is a pot and not walkable. So she must stand adjacent and face the pot to interact.\n\nAdjacent tiles to the pot (3,0) are: (2,0), (4,0), (3,1). \n- (2,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty? Actually, we are told the non-empty kitchen counters, and (2,0) is in the list but we don't know if it's occupied? Actually, the list of non-empty kitchen counters does not include (2,0) because (2,0) is in the list of kitchen counters but the non-empty ones are listed separately. The non-empty ones are: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3). So (2,0) is empty? But note: the kitchen counter at (2,0) is a tile that can hold an item. Currently, it's empty because it's not in the non-empty list.\n\nSo (2,0) is an empty kitchen counter? Actually, the tile type is kitchen counter, but it can be empty or occupied. Since it's not listed in non-empty, it is empty. Similarly, (3,1) is an empty tile? The tile types: we have a grid. We know the positions of kitchen counters. (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)]. So (3,1) is not a kitchen counter? Then it must be an empty tile? Actually, the only non-empty tiles are the ones listed as dispensers, pot, serving counter, and kitchen counters (which are always present but may be empty). So (3,1) is not a kitchen counter, not a dispenser, not a pot, not a serving counter -> so it's an empty tile.\n\nTherefore, Alice can move to (3,1) and then face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). But note: she is currently at (4,1) facing down. She can move left to (3,1) and then she will be adjacent to the pot (which is at (3,0)) and if she faces down, she will be facing the pot? Actually, (3,0) is below (3,1). So if she moves to (3,1) and then faces down, she can interact.\n\nAlternatively, she could move down from (4,1) to (4,0)? But (4,0) is a pot tile? And pots are not walkable. So she cannot step on (4,0). Similarly, she cannot step on (3,0). So the only way is to go to (3,1) and face down.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n- Turn 89: Move left (L) to (3,1). Now she is at (3,1) and still holding the onion. Then she can interact with the pot below her (at (3,0)) if she faces down. But note: after moving left, her orientation? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when she moves left, she will be at (3,1) and her orientation becomes left? Actually, the move action changes both position and orientation. So if she moves left, she will be facing left? Then she cannot interact with the pot which is below her. So she must either change orientation after moving or plan a move that leaves her facing the pot.\n\nAlternatively, she can change orientation without moving? There is an action for that: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But note: the adjacent tile condition only applies for blocking the move? Actually, the description says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That seems to be about the move action? Let me clarify the actions:\n\n- Move: changes position and orientation. The movement is only allowed if the target tile is empty and walkable? The constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So (3,1) is an empty tile? Yes, because it's not a kitchen counter (so not a non-empty tile in the sense of having an item? Actually, the tile types: empty tile is walkable. Kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? But the problem says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" It doesn't explicitly say if kitchen counters are walkable. But the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty\" meaning having an item? Or the tile type? The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined by having an item? Actually, the tile types that are not empty tiles are non-walkable? The rules: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and the others (dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are not empty tiles? So they are non-walkable? \n\nBut then how do players access them? They stand adjacent. The rule: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo non-empty tiles (meaning tiles that are not of type \"Empty Tile\") are non-walkable. Therefore, (3,1) is an empty tile? We established that because it's not in the list of kitchen counters, dispensers, etc. So yes, (3,1) is walkable.\n\nSo back to Alice: at (4,1) facing down. \nOption 1: \n  - Move left to (3,1): this will change her position to (3,1) and orientation to left. Then she is adjacent to the pot (at (3,0)) but she is facing left, not down. So she cannot interact with the pot because she is not facing it. Then she would need to change orientation to down. So two actions: L (to move left) and then D (to face down). Then she can interact.\n\nOption 2:\n  - Change orientation to left (without moving) so she is still at (4,1) facing left? Then she can move left to (3,1) and in that move she will be moving left and thus her orientation becomes left? Then again, she is at (3,1) facing left. Then she must change to down.\n\nEither way, it takes two actions to get to (3,1) facing down, then one action to interact.\n\nBut note: she can also move down? She is at (4,1) and below is (4,0) which is a pot -> non-walkable. So she cannot move down.\n\nAlternatively, she can move right? But that would be away.\n\nSo the quickest way is to move left to (3,1) and then face down, then interact.\n\nBut let's see: \n- Turn 89: Alice moves left (L) -> now at (3,1), facing left.\n- Turn 90: Alice changes orientation to down (D) -> now at (3,1), facing down.\n- Turn 91: Alice interacts (I) -> adds the onion to the pot at (3,0). Now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking. Alice is now holding nothing.\n\nBut note: the pot starts cooking automatically at 3 ingredients. So at turn 91, the pot at (3,0) starts cooking. It will be ready at turn 91 + 5 = turn 96.\n\nNow, what about Bob? Bob is at (4,3) holding nothing, facing left. We need to deliver the soup when it's ready. To deliver, we need a plate. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (4,3). How can he get a plate?\n\nAlternatively, we can use a plate from the plate dispenser. Bob is free. He can go to the plate dispenser and get a plate, then bring it to the pot when the soup is ready.\n\nBut note: there are also kitchen counters that might have plates? But we don't see any plate on the kitchen counters. The non-empty kitchen counters only have onions.\n\nSo Bob must get a plate from the dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBob's current position: (4,3). The plate dispenser is at (0,2). The grid:\n\nWe don't have a full grid, but we can infer the layout from the tile positions.\n\nThe kitchen counters are at various positions. Let's try to map:\n\nThe path from (4,3) to (0,2): \n- (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> then from (0,3) to (0,2): but (0,3) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion) -> so it's non-walkable? Actually, we cannot walk on non-empty tiles? But note: the kitchen counter tile is non-walkable regardless of whether it has an item? Because the tile type is not empty? The rule says: non-empty tiles (meaning tiles that are not of type \"Empty Tile\") are non-walkable. So kitchen counters are non-walkable. Therefore, Bob cannot step on (0,3). \n\nHow about going via (4,3) -> (4,2)? (4,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion) -> non-walkable. So he cannot go up to (4,2). \n\nWhat are the adjacent tiles to (4,3)? \n- Left: (3,3) -> what is (3,3)? It's not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at: ... (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters. (3,3) is not in the list? So it should be an empty tile? Similarly, (2,3) and (1,3) are not in the kitchen counter list -> empty tiles? Then (0,3) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. So Bob cannot go to (0,3). \n\nHow to get to (0,2)? Maybe via (1,2) or (0,1) or (0,2) itself? (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-walkable. So Bob must stand adjacent to (0,2) and face it to interact.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (0,2): \n- Above: (0,3) -> kitchen counter, non-walkable.\n- Below: (0,1) -> kitchen counter? Yes, (0,1) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-walkable.\n- Right: (1,2) -> what is (1,2)? Not in the kitchen counter list -> empty tile? So the only adjacent empty tile is (1,2). Bob must go to (1,2) and face left to interact with the plate dispenser.\n\nSo Bob's path: from (4,3) to (1,2). How? \n- He can go left to (3,3), then left to (2,3), then left to (1,3). Then from (1,3) to (1,2): move down? (1,3) to (1,2) is moving down? But (1,2) is not a kitchen counter? So it should be walkable? But note: (1,2) is adjacent to (0,2) and we need to check if there's a clear path.\n\nFrom (1,3) to (1,2): \n- (1,3) is an empty tile? We think so. (1,2) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters at y=2 are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (1,2) is not in the list -> empty tile. So Bob can move from (1,3) to (1,2) by moving down.\n\nSo the path: \n- (4,3) -> (3,3): left\n- (3,3) -> (2,3): left\n- (2,3) -> (1,3): left\n- (1,3) -> (1,2): down\n\nThat's 4 moves. Then at (1,2) he must face left to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2). So 5 actions.\n\nThen he will be holding a plate. Then he must bring the plate to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup? Actually, to serve the soup from the pot, he must use the plate on the pot. Then he gets a soup in a plate. Then he must deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nBut note: the soup won't be ready until turn 96. So we have time.\n\nBut Bob might be busy doing that. Alternatively, Alice could get the plate? But Alice is now free (after adding the onion) and closer to the plate dispenser? Let's see:\n\nAfter Alice adds the onion at turn 91, she is at (3,1) holding nothing. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). She can go to (1,2) and get a plate? \n\nPath for Alice from (3,1) to (1,2):\n- (3,1) -> (2,1): left? \n  What is (2,1)? Not in kitchen counter list -> empty tile.\n- (2,1) -> (1,1): left? \n  (1,1): not in kitchen counter list? The list: (0,1) and (7,1) are kitchen counters. (1,1) is not -> empty tile.\n- (1,1) -> (1,2): down? \n  (1,2) is empty tile? Yes.\n\nThen from (1,2) she can face left to interact with the plate dispenser.\n\nSo 3 moves: L, L, D. Then at (1,2) facing down? After moving down from (1,1) to (1,2), she is facing down. Then she must change orientation to left? Then interact. So 4 actions: L, L, D, L (to face left) and then I. \n\nBut note: when she moves from (1,1) to (1,2) (down), she will be facing down. Then she must change to left to face the dispenser? Or she could change orientation at (1,1) to face down? Then move down and she will be facing down? Then at (1,2) she is facing down, but the dispenser is to her left? So she must face left. So yes, she needs to change orientation.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,1) she can go via (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion) -> non-walkable. So she must go via (2,1) and (1,1).\n\nSo Alice: \n- Turn 91: at (3,1) after interacting, holding nothing.\n- Turn 92: move left to (2,1) -> facing left? Because she moved left, so orientation left.\n- Turn 93: move left to (1,1) -> facing left? Still left? Then at (1,1) facing left.\n- Turn 94: move down to (1,2) -> now at (1,2) facing down (because she moved down? The move action changes orientation to the direction of movement). \n- Turn 95: change orientation to left (L) -> now facing left.\n- Turn 96: interact (I) to take a plate -> now holding a plate.\n\nMeanwhile, the soup will be ready at turn 96. So at turn 96, the soup is ready. But Alice is at (1,2) with a plate. She must go to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup.\n\nPath from (1,2) to (3,0):\n- First, to (1,1): move up? But she is at (1,2) facing left. To move up, she must change orientation? \n  - Turn 97: change orientation to up (U) -> facing up.\n  - Turn 98: move up to (1,1) -> facing up.\n- Then from (1,1) to (2,1): move right? \n  - Turn 99: change orientation to right (R) -> facing right? Or if she moves right, she can do: move right to (2,1) and that changes orientation to right? \n    Actually, at (1,1) facing up: she can change to right then move? Or move right? \n    If she moves right from (1,1) to (2,1), she will be at (2,1) facing right? \n- Then from (2,1) to (3,1): move right -> (3,1) facing right.\n- Then from (3,1) to (3,0)? But (3,0) is the pot -> non-walkable. So she must stand adjacent and face down to interact? She is at (3,1) and the pot is at (3,0) (down). So she must face down. \n  - Turn 100: change orientation to down (D) at (3,1) -> facing down.\n  - Turn 101: interact (I) to serve the soup -> now she is holding the soup (on a plate).\n\nThen she must deliver to the serving counter at (7,2). That is a long way.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might be closer to the pot? Bob is at (4,3) at turn 89. We haven't used Bob yet. We could have Bob get the plate and then be near the pot at turn 96.\n\nPlan for Bob from turn 89:\n\nBob at (4,3) holding nothing, facing left.\nGoal: get a plate from (0,2) and be at the pot (3,0) when the soup is ready (turn 96).\n\nPath for Bob to (1,2) (to get the plate) as we described: 4 moves and one interact? But we have 7 turns (from 89 to 95) to get to the plate and then to the pot? \n\nBob's actions:\n- Turn 89: move left to (3,3) -> facing left.\n- Turn 90: move left to (2,3) -> facing left.\n- Turn 91: move left to (1,3) -> facing left.\n- Turn 92: move down to (1,2) -> facing down.\n- Turn 93: change orientation to left (L) -> facing left.\n- Turn 94: interact (I) to get plate -> holding plate.\n\nNow at turn 94, Bob is at (1,2) holding a plate. Then he must go to (3,0) to serve the soup at turn 96? But the soup isn't ready until turn 96, so he can be there by then.\n\nPath from (1,2) to (3,0):\n- (1,2) to (1,1): move up? \n  - Turn 95: change orientation to up (U) -> facing up? \n  - Turn 96: move up to (1,1) -> facing up.\n- Then (1,1) to (2,1): move right -> \n  - Turn 97: change orientation to right (R) -> facing right? \n  - Turn 98: move right to (2,1) -> facing right.\n- Then (2,1) to (3,1): move right -> \n  - Turn 99: move right to (3,1) -> facing right.\n- Then at (3,1) he must face down to interact with the pot at (3,0):\n  - Turn 100: change orientation down (D) -> facing down.\n  - Turn 101: interact (I) to serve the soup -> now holding soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 96, and at turn 96 Bob is at (1,1) and the soup is ready. But he can't serve until turn 101? That's late.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate, Bob can go to the pot area earlier? He can wait at (3,1) until the soup is ready.\n\nBut we have to get to (3,1) by turn 96? \n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1) in two moves? \n- (1,2) -> (2,2): but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty? Actually, (2,2) is a kitchen counter and we don't know if it's empty? The non-empty kitchen counters include (2,2)? The non-empty ones are: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3). So (2,2) is a kitchen counter but not non-empty? So it is empty? Then it is walkable? But the tile type is kitchen counter -> non-walkable? \n\nThe rule: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? Or non-empty meaning tile type? The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined by the tile type? Or by having an item? \n\nThe initial description: \"non-empty tiles\" in the context of interaction? Actually, the grid has tile types. The empty tile is walkable. The others (like kitchen counter) are non-walkable regardless of whether they have an item? \n\nThis is critical. Let me re-read:\n\n\"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nAnd for movement: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nAnd the tile types: \n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n- Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: these are not empty tiles -> so non-walkable.\n\nTherefore, even if a kitchen counter is empty (no item), it is still non-walkable? \n\nSo Bob cannot walk through (2,2) even if it is empty? So the path must be via (1,1) and (2,1) and (3,1). \n\nSimilarly, Alice cannot walk through (3,2) even if it has an onion? But it's non-walkable anyway.\n\nSo Bob must go via the empty tiles. \n\nTherefore, Bob cannot go directly from (1,2) to (2,2) because (2,2) is a kitchen counter tile -> non-walkable.\n\nSo the path is via (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). \n\nSo Bob's actions to get to (3,1) from (1,2):\n- Turn 95: move up to (1,1) -> facing up? \n- Turn 96: change orientation to right (R) -> facing right? \n- Turn 97: move right to (2,1) -> facing right.\n- Turn 98: move right to (3,1) -> facing right.\n\nThen at turn 98, Bob is at (3,1) facing right. The soup is ready at turn 96? But we are at turn 98. So the soup has been ready for 2 turns. That's okay, it doesn't burn? The problem doesn't say anything about burning. So we assume it stays ready until served.\n\nThen:\n- Turn 99: Bob changes orientation to down (D) -> facing down.\n- Turn 100: interact (I) to serve the soup -> now holding the soup.\n\nThen he must deliver to the serving counter at (7,2). \n\nBut note: there is another pot at (4,0). We haven't used it. And we have many onions on the counters. We could make another soup? But let's focus on delivering the first soup.\n\nNow, after Alice adds the onion at turn 91, she is free. She could start preparing another soup? For example, there is a pot at (4,0) that is empty. And there are onions on the kitchen counters. She could pick up an onion from a nearby counter and put it in the pot? \n\nBut we only have one plate dispenser? And we need to deliver the first soup. \n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get the plate and then serve the first soup, and Alice can start a second soup in the other pot.\n\nThe other pot at (4,0) is empty. We can fill it with 3 onions. There are onions at: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3). \n\nAlice is at (3,1) after turn 91. She can go to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. She must stand adjacent. The adjacent tile to (3,2) are: (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). \n- (3,1) is empty -> she is already at (3,1) at turn 91. \n- From (3,1) she can face up to interact with (3,2)? (3,2) is above (3,1). So if she faces up, she can interact.\n\nBut (3,2) has an onion. So she can pick it up? \n\nInteract: if she is facing (3,2) and it's a kitchen counter with an onion, and she is empty-handed, then she can pick up the onion.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 92: Alice changes orientation to up (U) -> now at (3,1) facing up.\n- Turn 93: interact (I) -> picks up the onion from (3,2). Now she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she can put it in the pot at (4,0)? But the pot at (4,0) is adjacent to (4,1)? Or (3,0) and (5,0) and (4,1)? \n- (4,1) is an empty tile? Yes. So she can go to (4,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). \n\nBut she is at (3,1) facing up. \n- Turn 94: change orientation to right (R) -> facing right? \n- Turn 95: move right to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing right.\n- Turn 96: change orientation to down (D) -> facing down.\n- Turn 97: interact (I) to add onion to pot at (4,0). Now the pot at (4,0) has 1 onion.\n\nThen she can get more onions? There is an onion at (4,2) which is above (4,1). So from (4,1) she can face up to interact with (4,2)? (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. \n- Turn 98: change orientation to up (U) -> facing up.\n- Turn 99: interact (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2). Now she is holding an onion again.\n- Turn 100: change orientation to down (D) -> facing down.\n- Turn 101: interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (4,0). Now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more. Where? There is an onion at (5,2) and (3,2) is now empty? She took the onion from (3,2) and (4,2). (5,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. How to get it? \nFrom (4,1) she can move right to (5,1)? But what is (5,1)? Not a kitchen counter? Then empty? Then from (5,1) she can face up to interact with (5,2). \n\nBut she is at (4,1) facing down. \n- Turn 102: change orientation to right (R) -> facing right.\n- Turn 103: move right to (5,1) -> facing right.\n- Turn 104: change orientation to up (U) -> facing up.\n- Turn 105: interact (I) to pick up the onion from (5,2). \n- Then she must put it in the pot at (4,0): so go back to (4,1) and face down? \n  - Turn 106: change orientation to down (D) -> facing down? \n  - Turn 107: move left to (4,1) -> but wait, she is at (5,1) facing down? Move left to (4,1) -> then orientation left? Then change to down? \n    - Turn 106: change orientation to left (L) -> facing left.\n    - Turn 107: move left to (4,1) -> facing left.\n    - Turn 108: change orientation to down (D) -> facing down.\n    - Turn 109: interact (I) to add onion -> now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking. It will be ready at turn 109+5=114.\n\nBut this is taking too long and we are only planning for a few turns? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We don't have a fixed H. But we should focus on the immediate delivery of the first soup.\n\nGiven the time, let's focus on the first soup. We have the soup ready at turn 96. We need to serve it and deliver it.\n\nWe have two options: Alice or Bob can serve and deliver.\n\nBut Bob is already on the way to get the plate. Let's assign Bob to get the plate and serve, and Alice to start a second soup.\n\nBut note: Bob might be too slow. We have from turn 89 to 96: 7 turns. Bob's actions to get the plate and get to (3,1) by turn 96? \n\nWe calculated:\n- Bob to (1,2) by turn 94: \n  Turn 89: L (to (3,3))\n  Turn 90: L (to (2,3))\n  Turn 91: L (to (1,3))\n  Turn 92: D (to (1,2))\n  Turn 93: L (face left) \n  Turn 94: I (get plate)\n\nThen from (1,2) to (3,1) in 3 moves: \n  Turn 95: U (to (1,1)) -> facing up? After moving up, she is facing up.\n  Turn 96: R (face right) \n  Turn 97: R (move to (2,1)) -> facing right.\n  Turn 98: R (move to (3,1)) -> facing right.\n\nBut turn 98 is after the soup is ready (turn 96). So he arrives at turn 98.\n\nThen:\n  Turn 99: D (face down)\n  Turn 100: I (serve soup)\n\nThen he must deliver to (7,2). Path from (3,1) to (7,2): \n  - He can go right to (4,1), then up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-walkable. So via (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (7,1) -> then up to (7,2)? But (7,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n  - Alternatively, from (3,1) to (3,2) is blocked. So go down? (3,0) is pot -> non-walkable. \n  - So go to (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (7,1) is non-walkable, so cannot. \n  - How about (6,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n  - We need to go to (7,2). The adjacent empty tile to (7,2) is (6,2) or (7,1) or (7,3)? \n    - (7,1) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n    - (7,3) is kitchen counter and non-empty -> non-walkable.\n    - (6,2) -> what is (6,2)? Not in the kitchen counter list? -> empty tile. \n  So Bob must go to (6,2) and face right to interact with the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nHow to get from (3,1) to (6,2): \n  - (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> then to (6,2): move up? But (6,1) to (6,2): (6,2) is empty? Yes. \n  - But (6,1) is walkable? We don't know what (6,1) is. It's not in the kitchen counter list -> empty tile. \n  - (5,1): empty tile.\n\nSo path:\n  - (3,1) -> (4,1): move right (1 action)\n  - (4,1) -> (5,1): move right (1 action)\n  - (5,1) -> (6,1): move right (1 action)\n  - (6,1) -> (6,2): move up (1 action) -> now facing up.\n  - Then change orientation to right (1 action) to face the serving counter at (7,2)? \n  - Then interact (1 action).\n\nSo from (3,1) to deliver: 5 actions.\n\nBut after serving at turn 100, he is at (3,1). Then:\n  Turn 101: move right to (4,1)\n  Turn 102: move right to (5,1)\n  Turn 103: move right to (6,1)\n  Turn 104: move up to (6,2) -> now facing up.\n  Turn 105: change orientation to right (R) -> facing right.\n  Turn 106: interact (I) to deliver.\n\nThis is taking until turn 106.\n\nAlternatively, after Bob serves the soup at (3,0) at turn 100, he is at (3,1) holding the soup. Then he can go directly to the serving counter? But he must go via (4,1) etc.\n\nThis is a bit long. Maybe we can have Alice serve the soup since she is closer? \n\nAt turn 91, Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing. The soup will be ready at turn 96. She can get a plate and be back by turn 96? \n\nWe calculated earlier: from (3,1) to (1,2): 3 moves and then interact, but that took until turn 96 to get the plate. Then from (1,2) back to (3,1) we had 3 moves? But then she would be at (3,1) at turn 99, then serve at turn 100. But the soup is ready at turn 96, so she is late.\n\nSo neither is perfect. \n\nBut note: there is a plate dispenser at (0,2). We only have one, and it's far. \n\nAnother idea: use the onion that Alice is holding at turn 89 to complete the pot, then have Alice immediately go to get a plate, and have Bob help by bringing an onion to the other pot or something. But let's try to optimize the first soup delivery.\n\nWe have many onions on the counters. Is there a plate on any counter? The non-empty kitchen counters only have onions, not plates. So no.\n\nSo we must use the plate dispenser.\n\nLet's have Alice get the plate after she serves the onion? Or have Bob get it earlier.\n\nAt turn 89, Bob is at (4,3) and can start moving to the plate dispenser immediately.\n\nAlice will complete the pot at turn 91. Then she can also move to help with the plate or start a new soup.\n\nBut for the first soup, we need a plate. The fastest is to have Bob get the plate and then serve the soup.\n\nBob's actions (from turn 89 to when he serves the soup):\n\n Turn 89: L (move left to (3,3))\n Turn 90: L ( to (2,3))\n Turn 91: L ( to (1,3))\n Turn 92: D ( to (1,2))\n Turn 93: L (face left)\n Turn 94: I (get plate) -> now holding plate.\n Then move to (3,1) for turn 98:\n Turn 95: U ( to (1,1))\n Turn 96: R (face right)\n Turn 97: R ( to (2,1)) -> note: at turn 96 the soup is ready, but he is at (1,1) facing right.\n Turn 98: R ( to (3,1)) -> facing right.\n Turn 99: D (face down)\n Turn 100: I (serve soup) -> now holding soup.\n\nThen he can deliver.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice after turn 91 can start on the second soup.\n\nWe are to plan for Alice. The question asks for a sequence of actions for Alice over the next several turns. We can choose H=10 or so.\n\nLet's plan for Alice from turn 89 onward:\n\n Turn 89: Alice is at (4,1) facing down, holding onion.\n To add to the pot at (3,0): \n   She needs to be at (3,1) facing down.\n   So: \n     Turn 89: L (move left to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1), facing left.\n     Turn 90: D (face down) -> facing down.\n     Turn 91: I (interact to add onion) -> holding nothing.\n\n Then she can pick up an onion from the nearby kitchen counter at (3,2) (which is above her).\n     Turn 92: U (face up) -> facing up.\n     Turn 93: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2)) -> holding onion.\n\n Then she can move to the other pot at (4,0) to put this onion.\n   To do that, she needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n   From (3,1) to (4,1): \n        Turn 94: R (face right) -> facing right.\n        Turn 95: R (move right to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1), facing right.\n        Turn 96: D (face down) -> facing down.\n        Turn 97: I (interact to add onion to pot at (4,0)) -> holding nothing.\n\n Then she can pick up another onion, say from (4,2) which is above her.\n        Turn 98: U (face up) -> facing up.\n        Turn 99: I (interact to pick up onion from (4,2)) -> holding onion.\n        Turn 100: D (face down) -> facing down.\n        Turn 101: I (interact to add onion to pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more onion. She can go to (5,2) or (2,2) or elsewhere.\n\nBut we only have to plan for several turns. Let's say we plan for 10 turns: from turn 89 to turn 98 (10 actions? Or from turn 89 to turn 89+H-1).\n\nThe problem says: plan a sequence of actions for Alice over the next several turns. We can choose H=10.\n\nSo Alice's actions for turns 89 to 98 (10 actions: turns 89,90,...,98):\n\n Turn 89: L\n Turn 90: D\n Turn 91: I\n Turn 92: U\n Turn 93: I\n Turn 94: R\n Turn 95: R  (move to (4,1))\n Turn 96: D\n Turn 97: I\n Turn 98: U\n\nThen at turn 98, she is at (4,1) facing up, and she will interact at turn 99 to pick up the onion from (4,2).\n\nBut we only output until turn 98.\n\nAlternatively, we can have her deliver the first soup? But she doesn't have the plate.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's output the first few actions for Alice to complete the first soup and start the second.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\n Turn 89: L (move left to (3,1))\n Turn 90: D (face down)\n Turn 91: I (add onion to pot)\n Turn 92: U (face up to prepare to pick up onion from (3,2))\n Turn 93: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n Turn 94: R (face right to move to (4,1))\n Turn 95: R (move right to (4,1))\n Turn 96: D (face down to interact with pot at (4,0))\n Turn 97: I (add onion to pot at (4,0))\n Turn 98: U (face up to prepare to pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nThis is 10 actions from turn 89 to turn 98.\n\nFor Bob, we are not required to plan, but we can optionally include. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can just output Alice's actions.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: I\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: R\nTurn 96: D\nTurn 97: I\nTurn 98: U\n}\n\nThis has Alice complete the first pot and add two onions to the second pot, and be ready to add the third.\n\nNote: at turn 98, she is at (4,1) facing up, so she can interact with (4,2) on the next turn to get the onion and then add it to the pot.\n\nThis is a good start.\n\nIf we want to be more efficient, we could have Alice after adding the first onion to the second pot immediately go to get another onion, but she is already near (4,2) so it's efficient.\n\nBob will be getting the plate and serving the first soup independently.\n\nSo this should work.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should focus on completing the first soup recipe by adding her onion to the nearly full pot at (3,0) and then start preparing a second soup in the pot at (4,0) using onions from nearby kitchen counters. The pot at (3,0) has 2 onions and requires one more to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). After adding her onion, Alice should gather onions from adjacent kitchen counters to fill the second pot. Bob is independently positioned to fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) and serve the first soup once cooked, then deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nAlice's action sequence for turns 89 to 98 is optimized as follows:\n- **Turns 89-91**: Move to the pot at (3,0) and add the onion to start cooking.\n- **Turns 92-93**: Pick up an onion from the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n- **Turns 94-95**: Move to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turns 96-97**: Add the onion to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 98**: Face up to prepare for picking up another onion from (4,2) on the next turn.\n\nThis sequence ensures the first soup starts cooking promptly and initiates a second soup, while Bob handles plate retrieval and delivery.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: I\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: R\nTurn 96: D\nTurn 97: I\nTurn 98: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 92. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nKey observations from the current state:\n- There are two pots: \n  - Pot (3,0) has 2 onions (needs one more onion to start cooking).\n  - Pot (4,0) has 1 onion (needs two more onions to start cooking).\n- The only recipe is 3 onions, which takes 5 turns to cook and gives 20 reward.\n- There are multiple onions already placed on kitchen counters and one being carried by Bob.\n\nPlayer states:\n- Alice is at (2,1) facing left, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (3,3) facing up, holding one onion.\n\nAvailable dispensers:\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n\nServing counter at (7,2)\n\nWe need to complete the soups and serve them. The pot at (3,0) is closer to being ready (only one onion short). The pot at (4,0) needs two more onions.\n\nSince Bob is holding an onion and is at (3,3), he is close to the pots (3,0) and (4,0). However, to interact with the pots, he must be adjacent and facing them. From (3,3), he can move down to (3,2) and then face down to interact with (3,0) or (4,0) (but note that (3,0) is two steps down from (3,3) and (4,0) is three steps down and one right).\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onions that are already on the kitchen counters. There are onions at:\n- (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3)\n\nBut note: (3,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters with onions, and they are above the pots. So if a player picks up an onion from (3,2) or (4,2), they can easily put it into the pot at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nPlan:\n1. Complete the pot at (3,0) by adding one more onion. Then it will start cooking and be ready in 5 turns (at turn 97).\n2. Meanwhile, we can start working on the pot at (4,0) by adding two more onions.\n\nBut note: we have Bob already holding an onion and standing at (3,3). He can move down to (3,2) (which is a kitchen counter with an onion) but note that (3,2) is occupied by an onion. So he can't step on it? Actually, kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? According to the rules, players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So (3,2) is occupied by an onion, so Bob cannot step on (3,2). He must go around.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (3,2) by moving down? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion, so it is non-empty. Therefore, Bob cannot step on (3,2). He must use a different path.\n\nLet me look at the grid:\n\nThe grid is not fully described, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles. We know the kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, and serving counter.\n\nWe can assume that the rest are empty tiles? The movement is only allowed on empty tiles.\n\nBob is at (3,3). The adjacent tiles: \n- Up: (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, cannot step.\n- Down: (3,2) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-empty, cannot step.\n- Left: (2,3) -> we don't have information, but if it's not in the non-empty list, it might be empty? But note the kitchen counters are at (0,0) to (7,0) and others. We don't have (2,3) in the non-empty list, so it should be empty? Similarly, right: (4,3) -> not listed, so empty? But we have (3,2) and (4,2) as non-empty.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) or down? No, down is blocked. So he must move left or right.\n\nBut note: he is facing up. To move, he must change orientation? Or can he move in any direction without changing orientation? The action \"Move\" changes position and orientation? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if he moves left, he goes to (2,3) and faces left.\n\nAlternatively, he can change orientation without moving? The action \"Change Orientation\" (L/R/U/D) doesn't move if the adjacent tile is not empty. But in this case, he is at (3,3) and adjacent tiles: \n- Left: (2,3) - not listed as non-empty -> empty? So if he changes orientation to left, he doesn't move? Then he can then interact? But to interact with what? He is adjacent to (3,3) itself? No, he must be adjacent to the tile he wants to interact with and facing it.\n\nHe wants to put the onion into a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). He is at (3,3), which is three tiles away from (3,0) and (4,0). So he must move closer.\n\nPath for Bob to reach the pots:\n- He can move left to (2,3) (empty, we assume) and then down to (2,2) (is (2,2) empty? The kitchen counters are at (2,2) according to the tile types? Wait, the tile types say Kitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ... (2,2) is in the list. So (2,2) is a kitchen counter. But is it occupied? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3). (2,2) is not in that non-empty list? So it is empty? Then Bob can step on it? Because it's a kitchen counter and empty? The rules say: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So if (2,2) is a kitchen counter and empty, then it is walkable? Yes, because it's a counter without an item.\n\nSo:\n- Bob at (3,3) -> move left to (2,3) (empty) -> then down to (2,2) (which is a kitchen counter but empty, so walkable) -> then down to (2,1) (which is where Alice is? But Alice is at (2,1) at turn 92, so if Bob goes to (2,1) at a later turn, then we must coordinate so that Alice is not there).\n\nAlternatively, Bob can move right to (4,3) (assumed empty) -> then down to (4,2) (but (4,2) has an onion? Yes, because non-empty kitchen counter at (4,2) has an onion. So he cannot step on (4,2). So that path is blocked.\n\nSo the only way for Bob to get down is via (2,3) and then (2,2) and then (2,1) and then (2,0) which is a kitchen counter? (2,0) is a kitchen counter. Is it empty? The non-empty kitchen counters list does not include (2,0), so it's empty. Then from (2,0) he can move right to (3,0) (which is a pot) but note: (3,0) is a pot and non-empty? The rules: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? But the pot is non-empty? Actually, the pot is a tile that is not walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that are not empty. The pot is a tile that is occupied (with ingredients) so it is non-empty? Therefore, Bob cannot step on (3,0). So he must stand adjacent to the pot and face it to interact.\n\nTherefore, Bob must stand at (2,0) and face right to interact with (3,0), or at (3,1) (if it exists and is empty) and face down? But we don't know the state of (3,1). Since it's not listed as non-empty, it might be empty.\n\nActually, the grid is 8x5? We don't have a full map. But we can assume that the tiles that are not listed as non-empty (with objects) are empty and walkable? But note the dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are fixed and non-walkable? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that have an object (like a dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter with an item, etc.). But what about empty kitchen counters? They are still kitchen counters, but without an item. The rules don't explicitly say, but typically in Overcooked, counters are walkable when empty? The problem says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then lists other types. But kitchen counters are a type of tile. How are they handled?\n\nLooking back: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter has an item, it's non-empty and not walkable. If it doesn't, then it might be walkable? The problem doesn't explicitly say, but the movement rules say: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and then the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? I think we have to assume that.\n\nSimilarly, a pot is non-empty (because it has ingredients) so not walkable. But when it's empty? The problem doesn't specify. But in the current state, both pots are non-empty (have ingredients) so not walkable.\n\nSo for Bob to reach the pot at (3,0), he can:\n- Move left to (2,3) [empty? we assume] -> down to (2,2) [kitchen counter, but empty? we assume because not listed as non-empty] -> down to (2,1) [but Alice is there at turn 92, so we must avoid that] -> then to (2,0) [kitchen counter, empty?] and then face right to interact with (3,0).\n\nBut at turn 92, Alice is at (2,1). So Bob cannot go to (2,1) until Alice moves.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (4,3) -> then down? but (4,2) is non-empty (has onion) so cannot step. So that path is blocked.\n\nAnother path: Bob at (3,3) can move down? But (3,2) is non-empty (has onion) so cannot. So he must move left or right.\n\nHe can move right to (4,3) -> then right to (5,3)? Is (5,3) empty? We don't have it in non-empty list. Then down to (5,2) but (5,2) is non-empty (has onion) so cannot step. So he can only move to (5,3) and then? Then he can go down? (5,2) is blocked. So he can go left to (4,3) and then down? no, (4,2) blocked. Or right to (6,3) and then down to (6,2)? (6,2) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at (5,2) and others. (6,2) is not in the list? The list: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (6,2) is not listed, so it might be an empty tile? Then Bob can go from (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) [empty?] to (6,1) [empty?] to (6,0) [kitchen counter with onion? non-empty, so cannot step] -> then to (5,0) [kitchen counter, empty?] and then left to (4,0) [pot, non-empty] -> but then he can stand at (5,0) and face left to interact with (4,0)? The distance between (5,0) and (4,0) is adjacent? Yes. But note (5,0) is a kitchen counter, and if empty, he can stand there? Then face left to interact with (4,0). But he is holding an onion, so he can add it to the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut that is a very long path.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can drop his onion on a kitchen counter that is empty and then go to the pot? But that might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's assign roles:\n\nAlice is at (2,1) and is holding nothing. She is close to the plate dispenser at (0,2) and the onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) are far. But note, there are onions already on counters. She can pick up an onion from a nearby counter? The closest onion on a counter is at (3,2) or (4,2) or (5,2) or (0,3) or (7,3). (0,3) is relatively close? (2,1) to (0,3): she can go left to (1,1) then up to (1,2) then left to (0,2) [which is the plate dispenser] but she doesn't need a plate yet. Then up to (0,3) to pick up the onion? But (0,3) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So she can stand on (0,2) and face up to interact with (0,3) to pick up the onion? But (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2)? Yes. Then she can carry the onion to the pot.\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) is closer to being completed. So we want to get one onion to (3,0).\n\nAlternatively, Bob can drop his onion at a location and then Alice can pick it up and use it? But that might be inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: Bob is at (3,3) and can drop the onion on an empty kitchen counter nearby? For example, at (2,3) if we assume it's an empty kitchen counter? But (2,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are listed at specific positions. (2,3) is not in the list? So it must be an empty tile? Then Bob cannot place an item on an empty tile? Only on a kitchen counter. So he must go to a kitchen counter to drop the onion.\n\nThe nearest empty kitchen counter? We know the non-empty ones. The kitchen counters that are empty are the ones not listed in the non-empty list. For example, (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0) without items? But (6,0) has an onion, so it's non-empty. The non-empty ones are: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3). So the others are empty. For example, (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) are empty? But (5,4) is in the non-empty list? No, the non-empty kitchen counters are listed as: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3). So (5,4) has an item? But in the list it's (5,4) contains a onion? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counter list says: Kitchen Counter on (5,4): contains a onion. So it's non-empty. So the empty ones are: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2) [if it's a kitchen counter and not listed as non-empty], (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (6,4), (7,4).\n\nBob is at (3,3). The closest empty kitchen counter might be (2,2) or (0,4) or (1,4) or (2,4). (2,2) is at (2,2) and is empty? Yes. So Bob can move left to (2,3) (if empty tile) and then down to (2,2) (kitchen counter, empty, so he can step on it) and then drop the onion by interacting? But he is on the counter? The interaction rule: to interact with a kitchen counter, the player must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the counter. But if he is standing on the counter, can he interact with it? The problem says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo if Bob is standing on (2,2) which is a kitchen counter, then he is not on an empty tile. And the tile he is on is non-empty? But it's the counter itself. The rule says he must be on an empty tile adjacent to the tile he is interacting with. So he cannot interact with the counter he is standing on? That means he cannot drop the onion while on the counter. He must be next to an empty kitchen counter to place the onion.\n\nTherefore, Bob cannot drop the onion on (2,2) by standing on (2,2). He must stand next to it, for example at (2,3) or (1,2) or (3,2) or (2,1). But (3,2) is non-empty (has onion) and (2,1) has Alice. So he can stand at (2,3) and face down to interact with (2,2). But (2,2) is empty, so he can place the onion there.\n\nSo plan for Bob:\n1. Move left to (2,3) [empty tile] -> now at (2,3) facing left? (because he moved left) \n2. Change orientation to down? Then interact to place the onion on (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is below him, so after moving left to (2,3), he is facing left. He then must change orientation to down (action D) and then interact (I) to place the onion on (2,2).\n\nThen Bob is free to move.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (2,1). She can move up to (2,2) but (2,2) will have an onion after Bob places it? But then it becomes non-empty and she cannot step on it. So she must avoid (2,2).\n\nAlternatively, Alice can move to the pot at (3,0) to add an onion. But she doesn't have one. She can pick up an onion from a nearby counter.\n\nThe closest onion is at (3,2) or (0,3). (3,2) is at (3,2) which is above (3,0). Alice is at (2,1). She can move right to (3,1) [if empty] and then up to (3,2) but (3,2) has an onion -> non-empty, so she cannot step on it. She must stand next to it and face it to pick up the onion.\n\nSo she can:\n- Move right to (3,1) [empty?] -> then change orientation to up (if not already) and interact to pick up the onion from (3,2).\n\nBut note: (3,2) is at (3,2) and (3,1) is below it. So she can stand at (3,1) and face up to interact with (3,2).\n\nThen she is holding an onion. Then she can move down to (3,0) is not walkable? (3,0) is a pot with ingredients, non-empty. So she must stand at (2,0) or (3,1) or (4,0) and face the pot to interact.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can face down to interact with (3,0)? (3,0) is below (3,1). So yes.\n\nSo:\nAlice:\n1. Move right to (3,1) [assumed empty]\n2. Change orientation to up? (to face (3,2)) and then interact to pick up onion.\n3. Then change orientation to down (to face (3,0)) and interact to add the onion to the pot at (3,0).\n\nBut after step 2, she is at (3,1) holding an onion. Then step 3: she changes orientation to down and then interacts to add the onion to the pot at (3,0). This will complete the pot at (3,0) and it will start cooking at turn 92 + ... let's count the turns.\n\nHowever, we are at turn 92, and we are planning for the next H turns. Let's try to plan step by step.\n\nBut note: Bob is also acting. We can control Alice and suggest for Bob? The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for Alice and also suggest what Bob should do? But the answer format is only for Alice. So we must only output Alice's actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but the answer format only has Alice's actions. So we output only Alice's actions.\n\nBut then how do we coordinate? We must assume Bob will act rationally? Or we can only control Alice. The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we should assume Bob will cooperate. But we don't have Bob's future actions. So we must plan Alice's actions based on the current state and what we hope Bob will do.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan only for Alice and hope that Bob will do the right thing. But that is risky.\n\nAnother approach: Alice can go to the plate dispenser to get a plate, so that when the soup is ready, she can serve it. But the soup won't be ready for 5 turns after we add the third onion. So we have time.\n\nBut first, we must complete the pot at (3,0). Who will add the third onion? Bob is holding one and is closer. But we cannot control Bob. So Alice can add it if she can get an onion quickly.\n\nLet's plan for Alice to get an onion from (3,2) and add it to (3,0).\n\nSteps for Alice (starting at (2,1) facing left):\n- Turn 92: move right to (3,1) [this changes her position to (3,1) and orientation to right? Because she moved right. But she was facing left. The move action changes orientation to the direction of movement. So after moving right, she faces right.\n- But to interact with (3,2) (which is above her), she needs to face up. So at turn 93: change orientation to up (action U). Then interact (I) at turn 94.\n- Then she is holding an onion. Then she needs to face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). So turn 95: change orientation to down (D). Then turn 96: interact (I) to add the onion.\n\nThis completes the pot at (3,0) at turn 96, and it will start cooking. It will be ready at turn 96 + 5 = 101.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. We hope he will go and drop the onion somewhere or use it. But if he doesn't, he might be in the way.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can use the onion that Bob is holding by having Bob drop it and Alice pick it up? But that requires coordination.\n\nBut since we only control Alice, let's focus on her.\n\nAfter adding the onion, the pot at (3,0) starts cooking. Then Alice can go to get a plate to be ready to serve.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). Alice is at (3,0) after adding the onion? No, she is at (3,1) after adding (because she interacted from (3,1)). Then she can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2). But (1,2) is not listed as non-empty, so empty? And (0,2) is a plate dispenser, non-empty? So she cannot step on (0,2). She must stand next to it and face it to interact.\n\nSo she can go to (0,1) or (1,2) and face (0,2). (0,1) is a kitchen counter? It is in the list and empty? Yes. So she can go to (0,1) and face right to interact with (0,2)? (0,2) is to the right of (0,1)? No, (0,2) is above (0,1)? Let's see: (0,1) and (0,2) are adjacent vertically. So she can stand at (0,1) and face up to interact with (0,2).\n\nBut (0,1) is a kitchen counter, and empty, so she can step on it? Then from there, she can face up and interact to grab a plate.\n\nSteps:\n- After turn 96: Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing (she just added the onion).\n- Turn 97: move left to (2,1) [faces left]\n- Turn 98: move left to (1,1) [faces left]\n- Turn 99: change orientation to up? Because (1,2) is above, but she can move up to (1,2) [if empty] -> move up to (1,2) [faces up]\n- Turn 100: move left to (0,2)? But (0,2) is a plate dispenser, non-empty, cannot step. So she must go to (0,1) first? From (1,1) to (0,1): move left to (0,1) [if empty] at turn 99? Then at turn 100: change orientation to up and interact to grab a plate from (0,2).\n\nBut (0,1) is a kitchen counter and empty, so she can step on it.\n\nRevised:\n- Turn 97: move left from (3,1) to (2,1) [faces left]\n- Turn 98: move left to (1,1) [faces left]\n- Turn 99: move left to (0,1) [faces left] -> now at (0,1)\n- Turn 100: change orientation to up (U) -> now facing up\n- Turn 101: interact (I) to grab a plate from (0,2)\n\nNow she has a plate. The soup at (3,0) is ready at turn 101 (since started cooking at turn 96, 5 turns later: 96+5=101). So at turn 101, she can serve it? But she is at (0,1) and the pot is at (3,0). She needs to go to the pot.\n\nAlternatively, she can go to the serving counter to wait? But she needs to get the soup first.\n\nTo get the soup, she must be at (3,0) with a plate. But she is at (0,1) with a plate.\n\nPath: (0,1) -> (0,0) [kitchen counter, empty] or (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). Then from (3,1) she can face down to interact with (3,0) to get the soup? But (3,0) is a pot. Interacting with a pot while holding a plate and the soup is cooked: she will pick up the soup? Yes, because the rule says: \"Serve soup (if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup).\" So she can pick up the soup.\n\nThen she can deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nBut that will take many turns.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might be available to serve. But we don't control Bob.\n\nSo for Alice, after getting the plate, she must go to the pot.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nAt turn 101, she is at (0,1) with a plate. She can:\n- Turn 101: move right to (1,1) [faces right]\n- Turn 102: move right to (2,1) [faces right]\n- Turn 103: move right to (3,1) [faces right]\n- Turn 104: change orientation to down (D) to face (3,0)\n- Turn 105: interact (I) to pick up the soup.\n\nThen she has the soup on a plate. Then she must deliver to (7,2). She is at (3,1). The serving counter is at (7,2). Path: (3,1) -> (4,1) [if empty] -> (5,1) [if empty] -> (6,1) [if empty] -> (7,1) [kitchen counter, empty?] and then face up to interact with (7,2) which is the serving counter.\n\nBut (7,1) is a kitchen counter and empty, so she can step on it. Then face up to serve.\n\nSteps:\n- Turn 106: move right to (4,1) [faces right]\n- Turn 107: move right to (5,1) [faces right]\n- Turn 108: move right to (6,1) [faces right]\n- Turn 109: move right to (7,1) [faces right] -> now at (7,1)\n- Turn 110: change orientation to up (U)\n- Turn 111: interact (I) to serve.\n\nThis is a long sequence, and we haven't considered Bob.\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) is ready at turn 101, and Alice picks it up at turn 105. What if it burns? The problem doesn't say anything about burning, so we assume it doesn't burn. It just stays cooked.\n\nBut the recipe doesn't burn? The rules say: \"Cooking time is 20 turns if ingredients do not match any recipe in the order, and serving the recipe does not yield rewards.\" But for matching recipe, it doesn't say it burns. So we assume it stays cooked.\n\nBut this is 20 turns from turn 92 to turn 111, which is long.\n\nWe might want to start another soup in the meantime? But Alice is busy.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice adds the onion to (3,0) at turn 96, she can go to get a plate and then wait near the pot? But that might be inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: use the existing onions on counters to complete the pot at (4,0). But Alice is busy with the first soup.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we only control Alice, let's stick to completing the first soup.\n\nBut we must consider Bob: he is holding an onion and might block the way. For example, if he moves to (3,2) but it's occupied, he might go to (2,2) after dropping the onion, but we hope he doesn't block Alice's path.\n\nTo minimize turns, we might have Alice get the plate first? But then the soup won't be ready for 5 turns after we add the onion, so it's better to add the onion first.\n\nLet's write the action sequence for Alice for the next 10 turns (H=10) to see what we can do.\n\nAt turn 92, Alice is at (2,1) facing left, holding nothing.\n\nPlan for Alice:\nTurn 92: move right (to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1) facing right.\nTurn 93: change orientation to up (U) -> now facing up.\nTurn 94: interact (I) -> picks up onion from (3,2). Now holding onion.\nTurn 95: change orientation to down (D) -> facing down.\nTurn 96: interact (I) -> adds onion to pot (3,0). Now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking. Alice is holding nothing.\nTurn 97: move left to (2,1) [facing left? because moving left]\nTurn 98: move left to (1,1) [facing left]\nTurn 99: move left to (0,1) [facing left] -> now at (0,1)\nTurn 100: change orientation to up (U) -> facing up towards (0,2)\nTurn 101: interact (I) -> grabs a plate from (0,2). Now holding a plate.\n\nThen at turn 101, the soup is ready. But she is at (0,1). She needs to go to (3,0) to get the soup.\n\nWe planned up to turn 101 (10 turns from 92: 92 to 101 is 10 actions? 92,93,...,101 -> 10 actions). But we might want to plan beyond.\n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H. Let's say H=10, so 10 actions: turns 92 to 101.\n\nBut at turn 101, she has a plate and the soup is ready, but she is not at the pot. So she must continue.\n\nBut we are only asked to provide a sequence for the next H turns. We can set H=15 or so, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan until she serves the soup, but that would be long.\n\nGiven the constraints, we output the first 10 turns.\n\nBut we haven't used Bob. We hope that Bob, seeing the pot is cooking, might get a plate and serve it, which would be faster.\n\nBob is at (3,3) holding an onion. We hope he will drop it and then get a plate and be ready to serve the soup at turn 101.\n\nBut we cannot control him.\n\nSo for now, we output Alice's actions for turns 92 to 101.\n\nBut let's double-check the grid: can Alice move from (3,1) to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty? Yes, because it was her starting position and no one is there now (Bob is at (3,3) initially, and we don't know where he goes).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) and (0,1) should be empty.\n\nAlso, when she moves from (1,1) to (0,1), (0,1) is a kitchen counter, empty, so she can step on it.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 92: R (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 93: U (change orientation to up)\nTurn 94: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 95: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 96: I (interact to add onion to (3,0))\nTurn 97: L (move left to (2,1))\nTurn 98: L (move left to (1,1))\nTurn 99: L (move left to (0,1))\nTurn 100: U (change orientation to up)\nTurn 101: I (interact to grab plate from (0,2))\n\nThis is 10 actions.\n\nBut note: at turn 94, when she interacts to pick up the onion from (3,2), is (3,2) adjacent and is she facing it? Yes, she is at (3,1) facing up, so (3,2) is above her and adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 96, she is at (3,1) facing down, so (3,0) is below and adjacent.\n\nAt turn 101, she is at (0,1) facing up, and (0,2) is above, so she can grab the plate.\n\nAfter this, she can then go to the pot to get the soup, but that is beyond the 10 turns.\n\nWe could adjust to make her go to the pot immediately after adding the onion, but then she doesn't have a plate.\n\nAlternatively, after adding the onion, she can go to the plate dispenser and then to the pot, as above.\n\nWe hope that Bob will complete the other pot or help serve.\n\nGiven the time, we output this sequence.\n\nBut note: there is an onion at (3,2) that we are using. What if Bob takes it? But at turn 92, Bob is at (3,3) and we are planning Alice's actions. Bob might act before Alice. But in the game, players act simultaneously? The problem doesn't specify. Typically in Overcooked, players act simultaneously.\n\nBut the action history is given separately, so we must assume that we only control Alice and Bob acts independently.\n\nTo avoid conflict, maybe Alice should use an onion that is not contested. But (3,2) is close.\n\nAlternatively, she can use the onion at (0,3). She is at (2,1). She can go to (0,3) to pick up that onion.\n\nPath: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) [but (0,2) is plate dispenser, non-empty, so she must go around? Or she can go to (0,3) from (0,2)? But (0,2) is non-empty, so she cannot step. So she can stand at (0,2) and face up to interact with (0,3)? But (0,3) is above (0,2). But (0,2) is non-empty, so she cannot step on it. She must stand at (0,1) or (1,3) or (0,4)? (0,1) is adjacent to (0,2) but not to (0,3). (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) and (0,4) and (1,3). So she can stand at (1,3) and face left to interact with (0,3)? Or at (0,4) and face down.\n\nBut she is at (2,1). To get to (1,3): (2,1) -> (2,2) [if empty] -> (2,3) [if empty] -> (1,3) [if empty]. (2,2) is a kitchen counter and empty? Yes. So she can:\n- Turn 92: move up to (2,2) [faces up]\n- Turn 93: move up to (2,3) [faces up] -> now at (2,3)\n- Turn 94: move left to (1,3) [faces left] -> now at (1,3)\n- Turn 95: change orientation to left? (she is facing left already) then interact to pick up onion from (0,3)? (0,3) is to the left of (1,3). So yes.\n- Then she has an onion. Then she must go to the pot.\n\nBut this takes more turns and is farther from the pot.\n\nThe first plan is better.\n\nTherefore, we output the first plan.\n\nFinal sequence for Alice (turns 92 to 101):\n\nTurn 92: R\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: I\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: L\nTurn 98: L\nTurn 99: L\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: I\n\nIn the sequence, turn 92 is the first action.\n\nBut note: at turn 96, after adding the onion, the pot starts cooking. At turn 101, she grabs a plate, and the soup is ready. Then she can go to serve.\n\nWe hope that Bob might be moving to serve the soup, but if not, Alice will do it later.\n\nTo maximize reward, we might want to start the second pot. But with Alice busy, and Bob holding an onion, he can add it to the pot at (4,0) which has one onion, so it needs two more. But after dropping his onion, he can get another.\n\nBut we cannot control him.\n\nSo this is a good start.\n\nWe output the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on completing the pot at (3,0) by adding the third onion and then preparing to serve the cooked soup. The pot at (3,0) currently has 2 onions and requires one more to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). Alice is positioned near an onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2) and can efficiently pick it up and add it to the pot. After completing the pot, Alice should head to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to grab a clean plate, ensuring she is ready to serve the soup once cooked.\n\nBob is holding an onion at (3,3) and is expected to contribute independently (e.g., by adding onions to the pot at (4,0) or assisting with serving). However, the plan below focuses only on Alice's actions for the next 10 turns (turns 92 to 101), as controlling Bob is optional and coordination is assumed through in-game collaboration.\n\n### Action Sequence for Alice\n- **Turn 92: Move right (R)**  \n  Alice moves from (2,1) to (3,1), facing right. This positions her below the onion on (3,2).\n- **Turn 93: Change orientation to up (U)**  \n  Alice faces up toward the onion on (3,2) to prepare for interaction.\n- **Turn 94: Interact (I)**  \n  Alice picks up the onion from (3,2). She is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 95: Change orientation to down (D)**  \n  Alice faces down toward the pot at (3,0) to prepare for interaction.\n- **Turn 96: Interact (I)**  \n  Alice adds the onion to the pot at (3,0). The pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (will be ready at turn 101). Alice is now holding nothing.\n- **Turn 97: Move left (L)**  \n  Alice moves from (3,1) to (2,1), facing left. This begins her journey to the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 98: Move left (L)**  \n  Alice moves from (2,1) to (1,1), facing left.\n- **Turn 99: Move left (L)**  \n  Alice moves from (1,1) to (0,1), facing left. This positions her below the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- **Turn 100: Change orientation to up (U)**  \n  Alice faces up toward the plate dispenser at (0,2) to prepare for interaction.\n- **Turn 101: Interact (I)**  \n  Alice grabs a clean plate from (0,2). She is now holding a plate and is ready to serve the soup at (3,0) (which finishes cooking this turn).\n\n### Outcome\n- By turn 101, the pot at (3,0) is cooked (started at turn 96 + 5 turns). Alice has a plate and can move to (3,0) to serve the soup (requiring additional turns beyond 101). This yields a reward of 20.\n- Bob is expected to use his onion (e.g., add to pot at (4,0)) or assist with serving, but Alice's actions prioritize completing the highest-yield task first.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 92: \\, \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: \\, \\text{I} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: \\, \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: \\, \\text{I} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: \\, \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: \\, \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: \\, \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 101: \\, \\text{I} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 95 (t_1 = 95). The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup.\n\nKey observations from the current state:\n- There are two pots: \n  - Pot (3,0): has 2 onions, needs one more onion to start cooking (which takes 5 turns for the recipe).\n  - Pot (4,0): has 1 onion, needs two more onions.\n- The only recipe is for 3 onions, which gives 20 reward and cooks in 5 turns.\n- There are many onions already placed on kitchen counters (at least 7 as listed). This means we don't need to go to the onion dispenser for now.\n\nPlayer states:\n- Alice: at (3,1), facing right (R), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (2,3), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n\nThe serving counter is at (7,2). We need to deliver cooked soup to this counter.\n\nCurrent plan:\n1. We have a pot at (3,0) that is almost full (2 onions). We can complete it by adding one more onion and then it will cook for 5 turns. After cooking, we can serve it with a plate.\n2. The other pot (4,0) has only one onion. We might want to fill it too, but note that the cooking time is 5 turns and we are at turn 95. We have to consider how many turns we can plan (H is not specified, but we can aim for at least 5 turns to cook the first pot and then serve).\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns (say, H turns)\". Since H is not specified, we can plan for a reasonable horizon that allows us to complete a soup delivery.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 95. The game might end at a fixed turn? We don't know. We must deliver as soon as possible.\n\nGiven the state, the immediate goal is:\n- Get an onion to the pot (3,0) to complete it and start cooking.\n- Then, while it is cooking, we can prepare plates and also work on the other pot if time allows.\n\nBut note: there are onions already on counters. We can use those.\n\nAlice is at (3,1). She is one step above the pot (3,0). To interact with the pot (3,0), she must be adjacent and facing it. Currently, she is facing right. The pot is at (3,0) which is directly below her. So she needs to move down to (3,0) or be adjacent and face it.\n\nBut note: the pot (3,0) is at (3,0). Alice is at (3,1). The tile below her (3,0) is a pot, so she cannot walk onto it (non-empty tile). Therefore, she must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,0) are:\n- (2,0): kitchen counter (occupied by onion? but (2,0) is a kitchen counter and we have a list of non-empty counters: (2,0) is not listed as having an onion? The non-empty counters listed: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3), (2,2). So (2,0) is empty? Actually, (2,0) is a kitchen counter and it's in the list of kitchen counters but not listed as non-empty? So it's empty.\n\nBut note: the pot (3,0) is non-empty (it has 2 onions) and is a tile that is not walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So Alice cannot step on (3,0). Therefore, she must interact from an adjacent tile.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (3,0) are:\n- (2,0): kitchen counter (empty? since not listed as non-empty) -> but kitchen counters are non-empty only if they have an item? The tile is there but if it doesn't have an item, then it's walkable? The rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So if the kitchen counter is empty, then it is walkable? Actually, the rules for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. ... and cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So if a kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? But note: the tile type is kitchen counter, but if it has no item, then it's empty? The rule says \"non-empty\" meaning having an item? \n\nHowever, the environment details list the kitchen counter positions. The movement constraint says \"cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". And non-empty tiles are those that have an item? But the tile itself is a kitchen counter, which is a type of tile. The rule might mean that if the tile is occupied by an item (like an onion on the counter) then it's non-empty and not walkable. But if the kitchen counter is empty, then it is walkable? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and the interaction rule allows placing or picking up from it. So the tile is always there, but if it has an item, then it's non-empty and not walkable. If it doesn't, then it's walkable? \n\nLet me check the non-empty kitchen counters: the list provided does not include (2,0), so (2,0) is empty and therefore walkable? Similarly, (3,0) is a pot and is non-empty (because it has 2 onions) so it is not walkable.\n\nTherefore, Alice can stand at (2,0) or (4,0) or (3,1) and interact with (3,0) if she faces it.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (3,1). She is above the pot (3,0). She is facing right. To interact with the pot below, she needs to face down.\n\nSo she can do:\n- Change orientation to D (down) and then interact. But note: she is adjacent? (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) (below her). So she is adjacent and if she faces down, she can interact.\n\nAlternatively, she can move down? But (3,0) is non-empty (pot with items) so she cannot step on it.\n\nSo at (3,1), facing down, she can interact with the pot below.\n\nWhat happens when she interacts? She is holding nothing. The pot is not full (only 2 onions). So she cannot serve soup (because she doesn't have a plate and the soup isn't cooked). She can only add an ingredient if she is holding one. But she is holding nothing. Therefore, the interaction would do nothing? \n\nWe need to get an onion to put into the pot. Alice is holding nothing. So she must first pick up an onion from a kitchen counter.\n\nThere are onions on kitchen counters at: \n- (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3), (2,2)\n\nThe closest one to Alice (3,1) is (3,2) and (4,2). (3,2) is one step above? Alice is at (3,1). (3,2) is at (3,2) which is one step above? But note: (3,1) is at y=1, (3,2) is at y=2 -> so north. She is facing right. To pick up from (3,2), she must be adjacent and face it. She can go to (3,2) but wait: (3,2) is a kitchen counter and it is non-empty (has an onion) so she cannot step on it. Therefore, she must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,2): \n- (3,1): empty? (it's the current position of Alice) -> but (3,1) is an empty tile? The tile types: (3,1) is not listed as any special tile, so it's an empty tile. \n- (2,2): kitchen counter (non-empty, has onion) -> not walkable.\n- (4,2): kitchen counter (non-empty) -> not walkable.\n- (3,3): not provided, but let's see the grid: the grid is from (0,0) to (7,4). (3,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter or dispenser, so it might be empty? But we don't have a full grid. We can assume that any coordinate not listed is an empty tile.\n\nBut note: the player Bob is at (2,3). So (2,3) is occupied by Bob? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So we cannot step on (2,3). Similarly, we cannot step on (3,3) if Bob moves there? But currently Bob is at (2,3).\n\nSo for Alice to pick up the onion at (3,2):\n- She is at (3,1). (3,2) is north of her. She can face up (U) and then interact? But she is adjacent (south of (3,2))? And facing up (towards (3,2))? Then she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, she can pick up the onion at (4,2) by going to (4,1) and facing up? But she is at (3,1). (4,1) is to the right. But (4,1) is an empty tile? We don't know. Since it's not listed, we assume it's empty.\n\nBut note: Bob is at (2,3). We must avoid collisions.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n1. Pick up an onion from (3,2): \n   - At (3,1), facing up (U) and then interact (I). \n   - But wait: the orientation change: the action \"Change Orientation\" (U) would change her orientation to up without moving. Then she can interact.\n\nBut note: the action history for Alice: L, L, D, I, R. The most recent is R (right). Now at (3,1) facing right. So she is not facing up. So she must change orientation to up.\n\nSo for turn 95 (t_1 = 95) for Alice: U (change orientation to up). Then she is at (3,1) facing up.\n\nThen turn 96: I (interact) to pick up the onion from (3,2). Then she will be holding an onion.\n\nThen she can turn to face down to interact with the pot (3,0). But note: she is at (3,1). The pot is at (3,0) (south). So she must face down.\n\nTurn 97: Change orientation to down (D). Then she is facing down.\n\nTurn 98: Interact (I) to put the onion into the pot (3,0). Then the pot (3,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking. The cooking will take 5 turns. So at turn 98, the pot starts cooking and will be ready at turn 98 + 5 = 103.\n\nNow, what about Bob? Bob is at (2,3) facing down, holding nothing. He can help by getting a plate and then serving the soup when it's ready.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (2,3). He can go to (0,2) to get a plate. But note: there are kitchen counters with onions in the way? We need a path.\n\nBob's path to plate dispenser:\n- From (2,3): move left to (1,3)? But (1,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter? So empty? Then (0,3) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty, so not walkable. But he can go to (0,3)? No, because it's non-empty. So he must go around? \n\nAlternatively, he can go up? But (2,3) to (2,4)? (2,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (2,4) is in the kitchen counter list. And it is non-empty? We have non-empty counters: (5,4) has an onion, but (2,4) is not listed as non-empty? The non-empty list: (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (7,3), (2,2). So (2,4) is a kitchen counter but empty? Then he can walk on (2,4). Then to (1,4) (kitchen counter, empty? because not listed as non-empty) and then to (0,4) (kitchen counter, non-empty? (0,4) is in the non-empty list? No, the non-empty list includes (0,4)? Wait, the non-empty kitchen counters: (0,4) is in the list? The list: \"Kitchen Counter on (0, 4): contains a onion;\" -> so (0,4) is non-empty and not walkable.\n\nSo Bob cannot go through (0,4). \n\nAlternative path: from (2,3) to (2,2)? (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has onion) -> not walkable. So he cannot go up to (2,4) and then left because (1,4) might be walkable (if empty) but then (0,4) is non-empty. So he must go down? \n\nHe is facing down. The tile below (2,3) is (2,2) -> non-empty, so he cannot move down. He must move left or right? \n\nHe can move left to (1,3). (1,3) is not listed as a special tile, so empty. Then from (1,3) he can go up to (1,4) (kitchen counter, empty? because not listed as non-empty) -> walkable. Then from (1,4) to (0,4)? But (0,4) is non-empty -> not walkable. So he cannot get to (0,2) directly from above? \n\nAlternatively, from (1,3) he can go left to (0,3)? (0,3) is non-empty (onion) -> not walkable. So he cannot go left from (1,3). \n\nHe can go down from (1,3) to (1,2). (1,2) is not listed as a kitchen counter? So empty? Then to (1,1)? Then to (1,0) (kitchen counter, empty? not listed as non-empty) -> walkable? Then to (0,0) (kitchen counter, empty?) and then up to (0,1) (kitchen counter, empty?) and then to (0,2) (plate dispenser). \n\nBut note: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) are kitchen counters. They are in the list of kitchen counters, but not listed as non-empty? So they are empty and walkable? \n\nSo the path for Bob: \n- From (2,3): move left to (1,3) -> empty tile.\n- Then down to (1,2) -> empty tile.\n- Then down to (1,1) -> empty tile.\n- Then down to (1,0) -> kitchen counter (empty) -> walkable? Yes, because empty.\n- Then left to (0,0) -> kitchen counter (empty) -> walkable.\n- Then up to (0,1) -> kitchen counter (empty) -> walkable.\n- Then up to (0,2) -> plate dispenser. But (0,2) is a dispenser, which is non-empty? Actually, the dispenser is a source and is always non-empty? But the rule says: \"Dispensers: Sources for items\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So we cannot step on the dispenser. Therefore, Bob must be adjacent to (0,2) and face it to interact.\n\nSo Bob should go to (0,1) or (1,2) and face (0,2) to interact? (0,1) is adjacent to (0,2) (south of (0,2)? (0,2) is at y=2, (0,1) is at y=1 -> south. So from (0,1), facing up, he can interact with (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, from (1,2) (east of (0,2)): (1,2) is at (1,2) and (0,2) is west. So if he is at (1,2) and faces west (left), he can interact.\n\nBut note: (1,2) is an empty tile? We assume yes.\n\nSo Bob's actions:\n\nTurn 95: Bob is at (2,3) facing down. He needs to move left to (1,3). So action: L (move left). Then he will be at (1,3) facing left (because moving left changes orientation to left? The move action: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So moving left will set his orientation to left and position to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 96: move down to (1,2) -> action D. Then he is at (1,2) facing down.\n\nThen turn 97: move down to (1,1) -> action D. Then at (1,1) facing down.\n\nThen turn 98: move down to (1,0) -> action D. Then at (1,0) facing down.\n\nThen turn 99: move left to (0,0) -> action L. Then at (0,0) facing left.\n\nThen turn 100: move up to (0,1) -> action U. Then at (0,1) facing up.\n\nThen turn 101: interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2) (which is north of him) -> action I. He will pick up a plate.\n\nBut note: the soup in pot (3,0) will be ready at turn 103. Bob now has a plate and needs to be at the pot (3,0) to serve the soup? Actually, to serve: the player must be holding a clean plate and the pot has cooked soup? Then the interaction will put the soup into the plate and the player will then carry the soup in plate. Then the player must deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nSo after Bob gets the plate, he must go to the pot (3,0) to serve the soup when it's ready.\n\nBut the soup will be ready at turn 103. Bob at turn 101 is at (0,1) with a plate. He must go to (3,0) to serve. How?\n\nPath from (0,1) to (3,0):\n- (0,1) to (1,1): right -> but (1,1) is empty? Then (2,1): empty? Then (3,1): but Alice might be there? We have to coordinate.\n\nNote: Alice is at (3,1) and we have planned her actions until turn 98: she will be at (3,1) holding nothing after putting the onion. Then what? She can help with the second pot or get another plate? But let's plan Bob first.\n\nBob at (0,1) at turn 101. He can:\n- Turn 101: move right to (1,1) -> R. Then at (1,1) facing right.\n- Turn 102: move right to (2,1) -> R. Then at (2,1) facing right.\n- Turn 103: move right to (3,1) -> R. But (3,1) might be occupied by Alice? We must avoid.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 103, the soup is ready. Bob must be adjacent to the pot (3,0) and facing it to serve. The adjacent tiles are (2,0), (4,0), and (3,1). (3,1) is the one we are considering.\n\nBut note: (3,1) might be occupied by Alice. So we must have Alice move away.\n\nSo we need to coordinate: Alice should leave (3,1) so that Bob can use it to serve.\n\nAlso, Bob can go to (2,0) to serve? (2,0) is a kitchen counter and it is empty? So walkable? Then he can stand at (2,0) and face right to interact with (3,0).\n\nSo Bob can go to (2,0) instead of (3,1).\n\nPath from (0,1) to (2,0):\n- From (0,1): down to (0,0) -> but (0,0) is kitchen counter (empty) and he is at (0,1). He can move down? But (0,0) is adjacent and below. So:\n  - Turn 101: move down to (0,0) -> D. Then at (0,0) facing down.\n  - Turn 102: move right to (1,0) -> R. Then at (1,0) facing right.\n  - Turn 103: move right to (2,0) -> R. Then at (2,0) facing right.\n\nNow, at (2,0), he is adjacent to the pot (3,0) (to the east). So if he faces right (which he is after moving right), he can interact with (3,0).\n\nAt turn 103, the soup is ready. So on turn 103, Bob can interact to serve: he will put the soup into his plate and now he is holding a soup in plate.\n\nThen he must deliver to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nPath from (2,0) to (7,2): \n- (2,0) to (3,0): cannot, because non-empty.\n- So go up: (2,0) to (2,1): up? (2,1) is empty? Then (2,2): kitchen counter non-empty -> not walkable. So cannot go up from (2,0). \n\nAlternative: from (2,0) to (1,0) then (1,1) then (2,1) -> but (2,1) is empty. Then (3,1) -> but might be occupied? Then (4,1) -> empty? Then (5,1) -> ? We don't have the full grid. \n\nBut note: there is a kitchen counter at (5,0) (empty? not listed as non-empty) and (6,0) non-empty (onion) -> not walkable. So avoid (6,0).\n\nBob can go from (2,0) to (2,1) (if empty) -> then to (3,1) -> then to (4,1) -> then to (5,1) -> then to (6,1) -> then to (7,1) -> then up to (7,2) (serving counter). But (7,1) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (7,1). Is it empty? The non-empty counters do not list (7,1) -> so empty? Then walkable? And (7,2) is the serving counter, which is non-empty? The rule: serving counter is a tile that we cannot step on? We must interact from adjacent.\n\nSo Bob can stand at (7,1) and face up to interact with (7,2)? Or at (6,2) and face right? But (6,2) is not listed, so empty? \n\nBut let's see the grid: (7,2) is the serving counter. Adjacent tiles: (7,1), (7,3), (6,2). \n\nWe know (7,1) is a kitchen counter (empty) and (7,3) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-empty. (6,2) is not listed as a special tile -> empty.\n\nSo Bob can go to (6,2) and face right to interact, or to (7,1) and face up.\n\nBut from (2,0) to (7,1) or (6,2) is a long path. We are at turn 103 and we are planning for a few turns. We might not have to plan the entire delivery if H is small. But we can plan until the delivery.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We don't know H. We should plan until we deliver one soup? But the problem says \"maximize total reward\", so we might deliver more than one? But the other pot (4,0) has only one onion. We can also fill that.\n\nBut let's focus on the first soup.\n\nSo for Alice, after she puts the onion at turn 98, she is at (3,1) holding nothing. She can help Bob by getting a plate? Or she can work on the other pot.\n\nBut Bob is already getting one plate and will serve one soup. We can also start the other pot? The other pot (4,0) has one onion. We need two more. There are plenty of onions on counters.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can get a plate and be ready to serve the first soup? But Bob is already doing that.\n\nAnother idea: after Alice puts the onion in pot (3,0) at turn 98, she can go to get a plate and then serve the soup at turn 103. Then Bob can do something else? But Bob is already on his way to get a plate. We don't want both to get plates. We only need one plate for the first soup.\n\nSo Alice can instead work on the second pot (4,0). She is at (3,1). The pot (4,0) is to the east and below. She can go to (4,1) (if empty) and face down to interact with (4,0). But first, she must get an onion.\n\nShe can pick up an onion from (4,2) which is close. (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. She is at (3,1). She can move right to (4,1) (if empty) and then face up to interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen she can face down and interact with (4,0) to put one onion. Then she needs one more. She can get another onion from nearby, say (5,2) or (3,2) again.\n\nBut note: the onion at (3,2) was taken by her at turn 96? Actually, at turn 96 she picked up the onion from (3,2). But after that, she put it in the pot. The onion at (3,2) is gone? The state says \"Kitchen Counter on (3,2): contains a onion\" at the beginning. When she picks it up, it becomes empty. So she cannot pick again from (3,2). But there are others.\n\nSo after turn 98, Alice:\n- Turn 98: she just did I (put onion) at (3,0). Then she is at (3,1) holding nothing, facing down (because she turned down at turn 97 and then interacted at 98).\n- Then turn 99: move right to (4,1) -> R. Then at (4,1) facing right.\n- Turn 100: change orientation to up (U) to face (4,2). Then interact (I) at turn 101 to pick up the onion from (4,2). Then she is holding an onion.\n- Turn 101: change orientation to down (D) to face (4,0). Then at turn 102: interact (I) to put the onion into pot (4,0). Now pot (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more onion. She can get another one, say from (5,2). (5,2) is a kitchen counter with onion. She is at (4,1). She can move right to (5,1) (if empty) and face up to pick up from (5,2).\n\n- Turn 102: after putting the onion, she is at (4,1) holding nothing? No: after putting the onion at turn 102, she is still at (4,1) and holding nothing. Then turn 103: move right to (5,1) -> R. Then at (5,1) facing right.\n- Turn 104: change orientation to up (U). Then interact (I) to pick up the onion from (5,2) at turn 105? But we are at turn 103 and the first soup is ready. We might be exceeding the horizon.\n\nBut note: we are only required to plan for Alice. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for Alice only? But the example output format only shows actions for Alice? \n\nLooking at the answer format: it only shows actions for Alice? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the format only lists actions without specifying the player? It says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc. and each action is in {U, D, L, R, I, S}. It doesn't specify for which player. \n\nBut the context is that we are controlling Alice. The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\". And the current state is given for both. But the plan is for Alice? The task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can choose to only output Alice's actions? Or both? \n\nThe answer format does not have a place for Bob. So we should only output Alice's actions? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can output only Alice's actions and assume Bob is controlled by the environment? Or we can output both? The format doesn't specify. \n\nLooking at the format: it only says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc. So I think we are to output the actions for Alice only. Bob's actions are not required? Or we can output a joint plan? But the format doesn't have two actions per turn.\n\nTherefore, I think we are to output a sequence of actions for Alice only. Bob will be controlled by his own policy? But the problem says \"collaborate\", so we must consider Bob's actions to avoid conflicts? But we cannot control Bob? \n\nRe-read: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So if we want, we can output Bob's actions too? But the format doesn't have it. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we are expected to output only Alice's actions. We can assume that Bob is an independent agent but we can coordinate by planning Alice's actions accordingly (like moving out of the way).\n\nSo for Alice, we plan her actions until we have done what we can.\n\nRecap for Alice:\n\nTurn 95 (t_1=95): change orientation to up (U) to face (3,2) for picking onion.\nTurn 96: interact (I) to pick onion from (3,2).\nTurn 97: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot (3,0).\nTurn 98: interact (I) to put onion into pot (3,0). The pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking.\n\nThen:\nTurn 99: move right to (4,1) -> R.\nTurn 100: change orientation to up (U) to face (4,2).\nTurn 101: interact (I) to pick onion from (4,2).\nTurn 102: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot (4,0).\nTurn 103: interact (I) to put onion into pot (4,0). Now pot (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen she can get another onion for pot (4,0). The next closest onion might be at (5,2). But (5,2) is adjacent to (5,1). She is at (4,1). So:\nTurn 104: move right to (5,1) -> R.\nTurn 105: change orientation to up (U) to face (5,2).\nTurn 106: interact (I) to pick onion from (5,2).\n\nThen she can put it into pot (4,0). But she is at (5,1). To put into (4,0), she must go back to (4,1) and face down? \n- Turn 107: move left to (4,1) -> L.\n- Turn 108: change orientation to down (D).\n- Turn 109: interact (I) to put the onion.\n\nBut we don't know how long H is. The problem says \"next several turns\", so we can stop at a reasonable point.\n\nAlternatively, she can put it into the pot (4,0) from (5,1)? But (4,0) is not adjacent to (5,1). So she must move.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 103 and the first soup is ready. Bob is at (2,0) and will serve the soup at turn 103? Then he will hold the soup and need to deliver. We haven't planned beyond that.\n\nGiven that we are only planning for Alice, and we are to maximize the reward, we have started the cooking of two soups. The first soup will be delivered by Bob (we hope) and the second soup will be ready at turn 103 + 5 = 108? But wait: the second pot (4,0) has only 2 onions at turn 103. We are putting the third onion at turn 109? Then it starts cooking at turn 109 and ready at 114.\n\nBut we are not planning that far? \n\nAlternatively, after putting the second onion in pot (4,0) at turn 103, Alice can get a plate to be ready for the first soup? But Bob is already doing that. \n\nAnother idea: after the first soup is ready, Alice can serve it if she has a plate. But Bob is already getting a plate. So we don't need two plates.\n\nSo let's stop Alice at turn 103: she has just put the second onion into pot (4,0). Then she can get ready to get the next plate? Or she can rest.\n\nBut to be safe, we plan until turn 103 for Alice? But we have to plan a sequence of actions. The problem says \"over next several turns\". We started at turn 95 and we have planned until turn 103? That's 9 turns (95 to 103 inclusive?).\n\nActually, from turn 95 to turn 103: 9 actions? \n\nBut note: the actions are for turns: t_1, t_1+1, ... up to H-1? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=1}^{H-1}\"? Actually, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? Let me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=1}^{H-1}\" -> that would be from t_1+1 to t_1+H-1? But that doesn't include t_1? \n\nThe problem says: \"At turn t_1, plan a sequence of actions ... for the next several turns (say, H turns)\". So we are at turn t_1, and we plan for the next H turns? That would be turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1? So H actions? \n\nBut the answer format starts at \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\" etc. So we must output H actions? \n\nBut H is not specified. We can choose H reasonably. Since the first soup will be ready at turn 103 (if we start cooking at turn 98, 5 turns later: 98+5=103) and we are at turn 95, we have 8 turns until the soup is ready. But we can plan for 8 actions? \n\nBut note: we have already planned for Alice until turn 103 (which is 8 turns: 95 to 102 inclusive? Let's count:\n\nTurn 95: action 0 (first action)\nTurn 96: action 1\n...\nTurn 102: action 7 (8th action? because 95 to 102 is 8 turns: 95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102 -> 8 actions)\n\nThen at turn 103, we don't plan? But we can plan for 8 actions (H=8).\n\nSo Alice's actions from turn 95 to 102:\n\nTurn 95: U (change orientation to up)\nTurn 96: I (interact to pick onion from (3,2))\nTurn 97: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 98: I (interact to put onion into pot (3,0))\nTurn 99: R (move right to (4,1))\nTurn 100: U (change orientation to up)\nTurn 101: I (interact to pick onion from (4,2))\nTurn 102: D (change orientation to down)   [then at turn 103, she can interact to put into pot (4,0) but that is turn 103, which is beyond our 8 actions]\n\nSo we have 8 actions. But at turn 102, she is holding an onion and facing down at (4,1). Then at turn 103, she can interact to put into pot (4,0). But we are not including that in the plan? We can extend H? The problem says \"say, H turns\", so we can choose H=9? \n\nBut note: we want to maximize reward. The first soup will be delivered by Bob (if he succeeds) and we are starting the second soup. The second soup needs one more onion. So Alice can put that onion at turn 103? Then the pot starts cooking at turn 103 and will be ready at 108.\n\nBut we are only controlling Alice. So we can plan for 9 actions to include that.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for 8 actions and then the environment will take over? But we are to plan for several turns. Let's do 9 actions? \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify H. We can do:\n\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: D\nTurn 98: I\nTurn 99: R\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: I\nTurn 102: D\nTurn 103: I   (put into pot (4,0))\n\nThen the second pot has 2 onions? Wait, we put one onion at turn 98? No: at turn 98 she put into pot (3,0). Then at turn 103 she is putting into pot (4,0). But pot (4,0) had 1 onion initially. Then at turn 103, we are adding the second? So it will have 2. Still not full. We need one more.\n\nSo we should not stop here. She must get one more onion.\n\nBut we can only plan a limited horizon. We might not complete the second pot.\n\nAlternatively, after starting the first pot, Alice can focus on getting a plate and delivering the first soup? But Bob is already doing that.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only controlling Alice, we plan the 8 actions as above and then stop? \n\nBut then at turn 102, she is holding an onion and facing down at (4,1). She can put it into pot (4,0) at turn 103 (which is beyond our plan) but that is one step. We can include it? \n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can set H=9.\n\nSo let's do 9 actions:\n\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: D\nTurn 98: I\nTurn 99: R\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: I\nTurn 102: D\nTurn 103: I   (put onion into pot (4,0) -> now pot (4,0) has 2 onions)\n\nThen she is holding nothing. She can get another onion for the pot? But we stop at 9 actions.\n\nAlternatively, after putting the onion at turn 103, she can move to get another onion? But we don't include.\n\nWe have done what we can. The second pot has 2 onions and needs one more. Bob is serving the first soup.\n\nSo the total reward from the first soup is 20. The second soup will require one more onion and then cooking and delivery. We haven't planned for that.\n\nGiven the constraints, we output 9 actions for Alice.\n\nBut note: at turn 103, the first soup is ready and Bob is at (2,0) and will serve. But if Alice is at (4,1) and interacts at turn 103, that's fine.\n\nBut what about Bob? We are not controlling him, so we hope he does his part. But we must avoid blocking. At turn 103, Bob is at (2,0) and Alice is at (4,1), so no conflict.\n\nSo the plan for Alice:\n\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: D\nTurn 98: I\nTurn 99: R\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: I\nTurn 102: D\nTurn 103: I\n\nBut wait: at turn 103, Alice is interacting with the pot (4,0). But Bob is at (2,0) and interacting with (3,0) at the same turn? That should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice help with the delivery? But she doesn't have a plate. Bob has the plate and will serve.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: D\nTurn 98: I\nTurn 99: R\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: I\nTurn 102: D\nTurn 103: I\n}\n\nBut note: the action at turn 103 is the 9th action, which corresponds to t_1+8 (since t_1=95, turn 103 = 95+8). So if we plan for 9 turns, we output 9 actions.\n\nThis sequence will help complete the first pot and add one onion to the second pot (so now the second pot has 2 onions). Then Alice is free to continue in the environment.\n\nWe assume Bob will serve the first soup and deliver it.\n\nThus, we have maximized the reward in the short term by ensuring one soup is cooked and started the second.\n\nNote: The problem says \"based on the current game state and action history of both players\". We have used the state. The action history might indicate patterns? But we don't see any conflicting patterns.\n\nSo this is the plan.\n</think>\nBased on the current game state and the goal to maximize rewards by delivering soup recipes, the plan focuses on completing the almost-full pot at (3,0) (which has 2 onions) and starting to fill the pot at (4,0) (which has 1 onion). Alice will gather onions from nearby kitchen counters to add to the pots, while Bob (handled by the environment) is expected to fetch a plate and serve the cooked soup from (3,0) once ready. This coordination ensures efficient use of resources and minimizes idle time.\n\n### Key Steps for Alice:\n1. **Pick up an onion** from the kitchen counter at (3,2) (adjacent north of Alice's starting position).\n2. **Add the onion to pot (3,0)** to complete the recipe (3 onions) and start cooking (5-turn cook time, ready at turn 103).\n3. **Move to (4,1)** to access the kitchen counter at (4,2).\n4. **Pick up an onion** from (4,2).\n5. **Add the onion to pot (4,0)** (now has 2 onions, needs one more).\n\n### Action Sequence for Alice (9 turns, H=9):\n- **Turn 95:** Orient up (`U`) to face (3,2) for interaction.\n- **Turn 96:** Interact (`I`) to pick up onion from (3,2).\n- **Turn 97:** Orient down (`D`) to face pot (3,0).\n- **Turn 98:** Interact (`I`) to add onion to pot (3,0) (now cooking, ready at turn 103).\n- **Turn 99:** Move right (`R`) to (4,1) to access (4,2).\n- **Turn 100:** Orient up (`U`) to face (4,2).\n- **Turn 101:** Interact (`I`) to pick up onion from (4,2).\n- **Turn 102:** Orient down (`D`) to face pot (4,0).\n- **Turn 103:** Interact (`I`) to add onion to pot (4,0) (now has 2 onions).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- **Pot (3,0)** starts cooking at turn 98 and is ready at turn 103. Bob (positioned near (2,0) after fetching a plate) can serve it at turn 103, earning 20 reward.\n- **Pot (4,0)** has 2 onions after Alice's action at turn 103, requiring one more onion to start cooking (future turns).\n- Alice is free to gather another onion (e.g., from (5,2)) for pot (4,0) in subsequent turns.\n\nThis plan leverages existing onions on counters, avoids player collisions (Alice moves away from (3,1) after turn 98), and prioritizes completing the highest-reward task first (recipe in pot (3,0)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: I \\\\\nTurn 97: D \\\\\nTurn 98: I \\\\\nTurn 99: R \\\\\nTurn 100: U \\\\\nTurn 101: I \\\\\nTurn 102: D \\\\\nTurn 103: I\n}",
