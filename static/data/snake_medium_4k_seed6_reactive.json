        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Snake Initial State**:\n   - **Position**: The snake is at [(3, 3)], meaning it's just the head with no body segments (length = 1).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L).\n3. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are five internal walls at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food:\n     - (5, 3) with life_span=10, value=+1 (positive food)\n     - (4, 1) with life_span=10, value=+1\n     - (1, 6) with life_span=10, value=+1\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nSince the snake is moving Left (L) at the current turn, the possible actions are:\n- **Continue Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (2, 3)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3, 4)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3, 2)\n\n**Cannot Reverse**: The snake cannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of Left (L).\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) → (2, 3)\n- **New Position**: (2, 3)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Border walls: x=2 is within 0-7, y=3 is within 0-7 → OK.\n  - Internal walls: (2,2) is a wall, but we're moving to (2,3) → OK.\n- **Check for Food**: \n  - (5,3), (4,1), (1,6) → none at (2,3) → no food eaten.\n- **Collision Check**: Since the snake has no body segments other than the head, no collision risk.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no score change.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) → (3, 4)\n- **New Position**: (3, 4)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Border walls: x=3 is within 0-7, y=4 is within 0-7 → OK.\n  - Internal walls: (3,1), (3,2), (3,6) → none at (3,4) → OK.\n- **Check for Food**: \n  - No food at (3,4) → no food eaten.\n- **Collision Check**: No body segments → no collision.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no score change.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) → (3, 2)\n- **New Position**: (3, 2)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Internal walls: (3,2) is a wall → **Collision with wall**.\n- **Outcome**: Deadly move → **Invalid**.\n\n### Comparing Valid Moves\n\nBoth Left (L) and Up (U) are safe moves. Now, I need to decide which is better based on the food positions.\n\n#### Food Analysis:\n1. **(5,3)**: To reach this, the snake needs to move Right (R), but it's currently moving Left (L). Since instant reverse is not allowed, the snake cannot go Right immediately.\n   - **Path**: First, change direction to Up (U) or Down (D), then Right (R).\n   - But Down (D) is invalid, so only Up (U) is viable.\n2. **(4,1)**: To reach this, the snake needs to move Right and Down.\n   - From (3,3), moving Up (U) → (3,4) → then Right (R) → (4,4) → Down (D) → (4,3) → Down (D) → (4,2) → Down (D) → (4,1).\n   - This is a longer path.\n3. **(1,6)**: To reach this, the snake needs to move Left and Up.\n   - From (3,3), moving Left (L) → (2,3) → Left (L) → (1,3) → Up (U) → (1,4) → Up (U) → (1,5) → Up (U) → (1,6).\n   - This is also a longer path.\n\n### Immediate Goal\n\nSince the snake is alone and has no body, the immediate goal is to position itself to reach food efficiently.\n\n- **Left (L)**: Moves towards (1,6) but requires multiple steps.\n- **Up (U)**: Moves towards the center, allowing more flexibility to reach any food.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nIf I choose Up (U):\n- Next turn, the snake is at (3,4), direction Up.\n- Possible moves: Continue Up (U), Left (L), Right (R).\n- From (3,4), moving Right (R) → (4,4) → then Down (D) → (4,3) → Down (D) → (4,2) → Down (D) → (4,1) to reach the food at (4,1).\n\nIf I choose Left (L):\n- Next turn, snake is at (2,3), direction Left.\n- Possible moves: Continue Left (L), Up (U), Down (D).\n- From (2,3), moving Left (L) → (1,3) → then Up (U) → (1,4) → ... → (1,6).\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth options are safe, but moving Up (U) gives more flexibility to access both (5,3) and (4,1) in the future. Moving Left (L) is more restrictive as it's heading towards the corner.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nGiven the current state and the goal to maximize score, moving Up (U) seems more strategic as it keeps the snake in a more central position, allowing for more options in future turns.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Grid**: It's a 2D grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, and similarly for y).\n   - There are also internal obstacles at specific coordinates: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n\n2. **Snake State**:\n   - Positions: The snake is currently just a single segment at (3,4), which means the head is at (3,4) and there's no body yet (since length is 1).\n   - Direction: The head is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning the last move was upwards.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - There are four food items on the grid:\n     - (5,3): value=1, life_span=9\n     - (4,1): value=1, life_span=9\n     - (1,6): value=1, life_span=9\n     - (1,2): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Up (U), so the previous move was U.\n- **No Instant Reverse**: I cannot move Down (D) next because that would be the opposite of the current direction (U).\n- **Possible Moves**: Given the current direction is U, the possible next moves are U, L, or R (but not D).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nGiven the snake is at (3,4) and moving U, let's explore the possible moves:\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 4+1) = (3,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, so (3,5) is within bounds (since y=5 < 7).\n     - Obstacles: Check if (3,5) is in the internal obstacles list. The obstacles are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (3,5) is not in this list.\n     - Body collision: The snake has no body segments yet, so no body collision.\n   - Food at new position: Is there food at (3,5)? Checking the food list: no.\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - New head position: (3-1,4) = (2,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is the left wall, so (2,4) is within bounds (since x=2 > 0).\n     - Obstacles: (2,4) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n     - Body collision: None.\n   - Food at new position: No food at (2,4).\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**:\n   - New head position: (3+1,4) = (4,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, so (4,4) is within bounds (since x=4 < 7).\n     - Obstacles: (4,4) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n     - Body collision: None.\n   - Food at new position: No food at (4,4).\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nSince the snake is just starting (length=1), there's no body to worry about overlapping food. The immediate goal is to move towards the nearest positive food to increase the score.\n\nLet's find the Manhattan distance to each food item from the current position (3,4):\n\n1. (5,3):\n   - Distance: |5-3| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n2. (4,1):\n   - Distance: |4-3| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n3. (1,6):\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n4. (1,2):\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe closest food is at (5,3) with a distance of 3. Let's see how to reach it:\n\nFrom (3,4), to get to (5,3):\n- Need to move right (increase x) and down (decrease y).\n- Current direction is U, so cannot move D immediately (reverse move).\n- Possible moves towards (5,3):\n  - First move R to (4,4), then next moves could be R and D.\n  - First move U to (3,5), but that's away from (5,3).\n  - First move L to (2,4), which is away.\n\nThus, moving R seems the best initial step towards (5,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the current position (3,4)?\n\nAdjacent positions:\n- U: (3,5) - no food\n- D: (3,3) - no food (but cannot move D due to reverse rule)\n- L: (2,4) - no food\n- R: (4,4) - no food\n\nNo immediate food to eat in one move, so the goal is to position towards the nearest food.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nAfter moving R to (4,4), the next possible moves would be U, D, or R (cannot move L, opposite of R). From (4,4), the path to (5,3) would involve moving R to (5,4) and then D to (5,3).\n\nAlternatively, moving U to (4,5) is away from the food, and moving D to (4,3) is closer but not directly towards (5,3).\n\nThus, moving R seems the most direct path towards the nearest food.\n\n### Verifying Other Options\n\nIs there any risk in moving U or L?\n\n- Moving U to (3,5):\n  - Next moves would have to avoid D (reverse), so could go L or R.\n  - From (3,5), moving L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n  - Both moves take us further from (5,3).\n  - Not optimal for reaching the nearest food.\n\n- Moving L to (2,4):\n  - Next moves would have to avoid R (reverse), so could go U or L.\n  - From (2,4), moving L to (1,4) or U to (2,5).\n  - Both moves take us away from (5,3).\n  - Not optimal.\n\nThus, moving R is the most promising initial move towards the nearest food at (5,3).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the goal of maximizing the score by reaching the nearest positive food, the best immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

There are also internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n2. **Snake**: Currently, the snake is just a single segment at (4, 4), moving to the right (R).\n3. **Food**: There are four food items with their positions, life spans, and values:\n   - (5, 3): value=1, life_span=8\n   - (4, 1): value=1, life_span=8\n   - (1, 6): value=1, life_span=8\n   - (1, 2): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nSince the snake is moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Continue Right (R)**: (5, 4)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: (4, 5)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: (4, 3)\n\n**Cannot move Left (L)** because it's the opposite of the current direction (R).\n\n### Checking Each Move for Validity\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5, 4)\n- **Wall Check**: x=7 is the border, so (5,4) is within bounds.\n- **Obstacle Check**: Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (5,4) is not in this list.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5,4).\n- **Body Collision**: Snake is only one segment, so no body collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 5)\n- **Wall Check**: y=7 is the border, so (4,5) is within bounds.\n- **Obstacle Check**: (4,5) is an internal obstacle.\n- **Conclusion**: Invalid move due to obstacle.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 3)\n- **Wall Check**: y=0 is the border, so (4,3) is within bounds.\n- **Obstacle Check**: (4,3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (4,3).\n- **Body Collision**: No body collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. **(5, 3)**: To reach here, the snake needs to move right to (5,4) and then down to (5,3).\n   - But moving right first doesn't guarantee the food will still be there next turn.\n   - Also, the life span is 8, so it's not urgent.\n\n2. **(4, 1)**: To reach here, the snake needs to move down to (4,3), then (4,2), then (4,1).\n   - Again, life span is 8, so not urgent.\n\n3. **(1, 6)**: Far away, not immediately reachable.\n\n4. **(1, 2)**: Also far away.\n\n### Considering Immediate Rewards vs. Future Planning\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, it's safe to move in any direction except into walls or obstacles. The immediate goal is to find food while avoiding risks.\n\n- **Right (R)**: Leads to (5,4). From there, the snake can consider moving down to (5,3) where there's food.\n- **Down (D)**: Leads to (4,3). From there, the snake can continue down towards (4,1) where there's food.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here since the snake is only one segment.\n- **Body Collision**: Not a concern yet.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven that both Right and Down are valid but don't immediately lead to food, I need to consider the path to the nearest food.\n\n- **(5,3)** is reachable in two moves: R → D.\n- **(4,1)** is reachable in three moves: D → D → D.\n\nSince (5,3) is closer, moving Right first seems more efficient.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **First Move (R)**: (4,4) → (5,4)\n- **Second Move (D)**: (5,4) → (5,3) → eat food.\n\nHowever, the food's life span is 8, and the current turn is 2. It will disappear at turn 10. Since it takes two turns to reach, it's safe.\n\n### Alternative Consideration\n\nIf I move Down first:\n- **First Move (D)**: (4,4) → (4,3)\n- **Second Move (D)**: (4,3) → (4,2)\n- **Third Move (D)**: (4,2) → (4,1) → eat food.\n\nThis takes longer, but the food at (4,1) has the same life span.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Right seems more efficient as it leads to a food item in fewer steps compared to moving Down. However, since the snake is only one segment, it's flexible. \n\nBut looking at the obstacles:\n- Moving Right avoids immediate obstacles and sets up a path to (5,3).\n- Moving Down is safe but doesn't immediately lead to food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the options, moving Right seems the most strategic as it positions the snake closer to the food at (5,3) in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: [(3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2)] — these are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake Positions**: [(5, 4)] — this is a single-segment snake (only the head), currently at position (5,4).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: R (Right) — the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (5, 3, 7, 1): Position (5,3), life_span=7, value=1 (positive food)\n   - (4, 1, 7, 1): Position (4,1), life_span=7, value=1 (positive food)\n   - (1, 6, 7, 1): Position (1,6), life_span=7, value=1 (positive food)\n   - (1, 2, 8, 1): Position (1,2), life_span=8, value=1 (positive food)\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R) → (6,4)**:\n   - New head position: (6,4)\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is a wall, so (7,4) is out of bounds, but (6,4) is within bounds (since grid is 0-7).\n   - Internal obstacles: (6,4) is not in the list [(3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2)], so it's safe.\n   - Food check: Is there food at (6,4)? No, none of the food positions match (6,4).\n   - Body collision: Snake is only one segment, so no body to collide with.\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Up (U) → (5,5)**:\n   - New head position: (5,5)\n   - Walls: y=7 is the top wall, (5,5) is within bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,5) is not in the list, safe.\n   - Food check: No food at (5,5).\n   - Body collision: None.\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Down (D) → (5,3)**:\n   - New head position: (5,3)\n   - Walls: y=0 is the bottom wall, (5,3) is within bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,3) is not in the list, safe.\n   - Food check: There is food at (5,3) with value=1 (positive).\n     - Since the snake is only one segment, there's no tail to worry about (no \"Tail Reward Danger\").\n     - Eating this food will increase length to 2, and the tail will be at the previous head position (5,4).\n   - Body collision: None.\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, can eat positive food.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nWe have three safe moves: R, U, D.\n\n- R: No food, just moves right.\n- U: No food, just moves up.\n- D: Eats positive food at (5,3), increasing length and score.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, moving Down (D) to eat the food at (5,3) is the best immediate action.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide. \n\nIn our case:\n- Current snake length is 1 (only head at (5,4)), so no tail exists.\n- After eating, the tail will be at (5,4), and head at (5,3). \n- Next move, if we move back up to (5,4), the head would collide with the tail at (5,4), but that's a future consideration and not relevant for the current immediate move.\n\nHowever, currently, there's no tail, so no danger from this rule at t₀=3.\n\n### Checking for Other Foods\n\nOther foods are at:\n- (4,1): Far from current position (5,4), not reachable immediately.\n- (1,6): Far.\n- (1,2): Far.\n\nNo immediate benefit from moving towards these in the current move compared to eating the nearby (5,3).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (5,3).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 4\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Cells**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and anything on these borders is a wall.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2) — these are additional walls inside the grid.\n3. **Snake Positions**: Head at (5,3), body at (5,4). So the snake is two segments long, moving downward (D).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (4,1): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (1,6): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (1,2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Snake's Current Direction and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving **Down (D)**, which means its head is at (5,3) and was at (5,4) in the previous turn. \n\nFrom the rules:\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. So, since the snake is moving Down (D), it cannot move Up (U) next.\n\nTherefore, possible moves are: Left (L), Right (R), or continue Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move (L, R, D) based on:\n- Will it hit a wall or obstacle?\n- Will it collide with its own body?\n- Is there food in that direction that's safe to eat?\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D):\n   - Current head: (5,3)\n   - Move Down: (5,2)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: \n       - Border: y=0 is at the bottom, (5,2) is not on y=0.\n       - Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (5,2) is not in this list.\n     - Body collision: \n       - Snake body is at (5,4). Moving to (5,2) doesn't overlap with body.\n     - Food: \n       - No food at (5,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n   - Current head: (5,3)\n   - Move Left: (4,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls:\n       - Border: x=0 is left, (4,3) is not x=0.\n       - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is above, others not relevant. (4,3) is not an obstacle.\n     - Body collision:\n       - Body is at (5,4). (4,3) is not overlapping.\n     - Food:\n       - No food at (4,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n   - Current head: (5,3)\n   - Move Right: (6,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls:\n       - Border: x=7 is right, (6,3) is not x=7.\n       - Internal obstacles: None at (6,3).\n     - Body collision:\n       - Body at (5,4), no overlap.\n     - Food:\n       - No food at (6,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no food.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable soon or if moving towards them is beneficial:\n\n1. (4,1): value=1, life_span=6\n   - Current turn is 4, so disappears at turn 10.\n   - From head (5,3), to reach (4,1):\n     - Need to go Left to (4,3), then Down to (4,2), then Down to (4,1).\n     - 3 moves away.\n   - Life span is enough (6 turns left).\n   \n2. (1,6): value=1, life_span=6\n   - Disappears at turn 10.\n   - From (5,3), quite far, not immediately reachable.\n\n3. (1,2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - Disappears at turn 11.\n   - Also far.\n\n4. (2,5): value=1, life_span=10\n   - Disappears at turn 14.\n   - From (5,3), need to go Left to (4,3), then Up to (4,4), then Left to (3,4), then Up to (3,5), then Left to (2,5).\n   - 5 moves away.\n\nThe closest food is at (4,1), 3 moves away. \n\n### Planning the Path to (4,1)\n\nTo reach (4,1) from (5,3):\n1. Move Left to (4,3)\n2. Move Down to (4,2)\n3. Move Down to (4,1)\n\nBut we need to ensure that at each step, the path is safe and no immediate dangers.\n\nCurrent turn is 4, next move is turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5:\n- Move Left to (4,3).\n\nThen at turn 6:\n- From (4,3), cannot move Right (reverse of Left), so can move Left, Down, or Up.\n- Need to move Down to (4,2).\n   - Current direction would be Left, so Down is allowed (not reverse).\n   \nAt turn 7:\n- From (4,2), move Down to (4,1).\n\nThis seems safe.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nAt current turn 4, moving Left to (4,3):\n- Is (4,3) safe? \n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not body (body is at (5,4)).\n  - No food there, so no risk of eating anything dangerous.\n  \nNext move would be Down to (4,2):\n- (4,2):\n  - Not a wall (internal obstacles don't include (4,2)).\n  - Body would have moved from (5,4) to (5,3), so no overlap.\n  \nThen Down to (4,1):\n- (4,1):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Body would be at (5,3) and (4,3), no overlap.\n  - Food is there, and it's positive (+1), safe to eat.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules:\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (5,4).\n- After moving Left to (4,3), tail moves to (5,3).\n- Then moving Down to (4,2), tail moves to (4,3).\n- Then moving Down to (4,1), tail moves to (4,2).\n- At no point is the head adjacent to the tail with food on the tail cell, so this danger doesn't apply here.\n\n### Alternative Moves\n\nIs there any immediate food we can eat in one move?\n- Current head at (5,3), adjacent cells:\n  - Up: (5,4) — body, cannot eat.\n  - Down: (5,2) — no food.\n  - Left: (4,3) — no food.\n  - Right: (6,3) — no food.\n  \nNo immediate food to eat, so the best is to start moving towards the closest food at (4,1).\n\n### Deciding the Immediate Action\n\nAt turn 4, possible safe moves:\n- D: (5,2) — safe, no food.\n- L: (4,3) — safe, no food, but first step towards (4,1).\n- R: (6,3) — safe, no food, but away from food.\n\nBest is to start moving towards food: Left.\n\n### Verifying Other Food Paths\n\nIs there a better food to aim for?\n- (1,6): too far.\n- (1,2): too far.\n- (2,5): 5 moves away, but (4,1) is closer (3 moves).\n\nSo (4,1) is the best target.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt turn 4, move **Left (L)** to start the path towards the food at (4,1).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

From (4,3), can reach in 2 moves down (to (4,2), then (4,1)).\n- (1,6): Far away, not immediately reachable.\n- (1,2): Also far.\n- (2,5): Not immediately reachable.\n\nThe closest food is at (4,1). To reach it, we'd need to move down twice. \n\nCurrent move options:\n- If we go down now (D to (4,2)), next turn we can go down again to (4,1) to eat the food.\n- But we need to ensure that moving to (4,1) is safe:\n  - After moving to (4,2), the snake is [(4,2), (4,3)].\n  - Then moving to (4,1), the snake would be [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)].\n  - Now, the tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to the head at (4,1), so no tail reward danger.\n\nHowever, the food at (4,1) has a life_span of 5, and current turn is 5. That means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. But since the countdown decreases every turn including the current one, at turn 5, it's the last turn it exists. So we can't reach it in two moves; it will disappear before we can eat it. Therefore, we cannot eat (4,1) now.\n\nSimilarly, other foods are too far to reach immediately.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should also think ahead to avoid getting stuck. For example:\n- Moving left to (3,3):\n  - From (3,3), possible moves:\n    - Left to (2,3): Check walls — (2,2) is a wall, but (2,3) is not.\n    - Up to (3,4): Not a wall.\n    - Down to (3,2): (3,2) is a wall — cannot go here.\n  - So from (3,3), we'd have L to (2,3) or U to (3,4).\n\n- Moving up to (4,4):\n  - From (4,4), possible moves:\n    - Up to (4,5): (4,5) is a wall — cannot.\n    - Left to (3,4): Not a wall.\n    - Right to (5,4): Not a wall.\n  - So options: L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\n- Moving down to (4,2):\n  - From (4,2), possible moves:\n    - Down to (4,1): But food at (4,1) will disappear, and next is (4,0) which is a wall.\n    - Left to (3,2): (3,2) is a wall — cannot.\n    - Right to (5,2): Not a wall.\n  - So only R to (5,2) is possible after D to (4,2).\n\nMoving down seems limiting because after (4,2), only right is possible, leading to (5,2), and then options from there may be limited.\n\nMoving left to (3,3) seems safer as it keeps more options open (left or up next).\n\nMoving up to (4,4) also keeps options open (left or right next).\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween moving left or up, both seem safe with future options. Moving down seems more restrictive. \n\nBetween left and up:\n- Left: leads to (3,3), then can go left or up.\n- Up: leads to (4,4), then can go left or right.\n\nLooking at food positions, none are immediately reachable, so we should prioritize maintaining flexibility.\n\nLet's choose **Up (U)** to (4,4), as it might position us better to reach some food in future turns (like (1,6) or (2,5)), though they're not immediate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(2,5) - value: 1, life_span: 8\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since it's currently moving Up (U), it cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: From (4,4) to (4,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,5) is not a border wall (y=7 is the top border). Is (4,5) an internal obstacle? No, internal obstacles are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). Wait, (4,5) is listed as an internal obstacle! So moving Up would hit the wall at (4,5). **Invalid move**.\n   \n2. **Left (L)**: From (4,4) to (3,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,4) is not a border wall. Is it an internal obstacle? No, internal obstacles are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). So no wall here.\n     - Body: Snake's body is at (4,3). Moving to (3,4) doesn't collide with body.\n   - Check for food: Is there food at (3,4)? No, food is at (4,1), (1,6), (1,2), (2,5).\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: From (4,4) to (5,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,4) is not a border wall (x=7 is the right border). Is it an internal obstacle? No.\n     - Body: No collision.\n   - Check for food: No food at (5,4).\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate adjacent cells have food. The closest foods are:\n- (4,1): Below the head, but we're moving Up currently. To reach it, we'd need to go Down, which is not allowed next move (no instant reverse).\n- (1,6): Far top-left.\n- (1,2): Bottom-left.\n- (2,5): Top-left.\n\nGiven that, the immediate moves (L or R) don't lead to food. But let's think about setting up for future moves.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Left or Right\n\n**If we go Left to (3,4)**:\n- Next possible moves from (3,4), direction L:\n  - Can't go R (reverse), so can go U, D, L.\n  - U to (3,5): Check walls - (3,5) is not an obstacle. Food at (2,5) is nearby.\n  - D to (3,3): Safe, no food.\n  - L to (2,4): Safe, no food.\n\n**If we go Right to (5,4)**:\n- Next possible moves from (5,4), direction R:\n  - Can't go L, so can go U, D, R.\n  - U to (5,5): Safe, no food.\n  - D to (5,3): Safe, no food.\n  - R to (6,4): Safe, no food.\n\nGoing Left seems slightly better because from (3,4), moving Up next can approach (2,5) food.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake's tail is at (4,3). The head is at (4,4). Adjacent to the tail is (4,3), but the head is not adjacent to the tail in terms of possible moves (since tail is at (4,3), head at (4,4), adjacent would be (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), but not directly adjacent in a way that causes tail reward danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Right, both are safe, but Left allows us to potentially move towards (2,5) food in the next move. Right doesn't offer a clear path to food soon.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Left (L) to (2,4)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (2,4) is not a wall (border walls are x=0,7; y=0,7; internal walls don't include (2,4))\n  - Body: Next body segment is at (4,4), so no collision.\n- **Check for food at (2,4)**: No food listed at (2,4).\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,5)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (3,5) is not a wall (internal walls don't include (3,5))\n  - Body: Next body segment is at (4,4), so no collision.\n- **Check for food at (3,5)**: No food listed at (3,5).\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,3)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Next body segment is at (4,4), so no collision.\n- **Check for food at (3,3)**: No food listed at (3,3).\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Accessibility\n\nNone of the immediate adjacent cells have food. However, let's look at the positions of the food to see if moving in a certain direction might lead us closer to food in future turns.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (4,1): To reach this, we'd need to go down and left. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) is a step towards it.\n2. (1,6): Up and left. From (3,4), moving left to (2,4) is a step towards it.\n3. (1,2): Down and left. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) is a step towards it.\n4. (2,5): Up and left. From (3,4), moving up to (3,5) is a step towards it.\n5. (1,1): Down and left. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) is a step towards it.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake is only 2 segments long: head at (3,4) and tail at (4,4). The tail is adjacent to the head (right next to it at (4,4)). \n\nIs there positive food under the tail? Let's check if (4,4) is a food position:\nLooking at food positions: (4,1), (1,6), (1,2), (2,5), (1,1) — none are at (4,4). So no danger of eating food under the tail in this move.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nAll food has life_span >=3, so none are about to disappear immediately. No urgency based on life spans.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves are safe with no immediate reward. We should choose a move that brings us closer to the nearest food.\n\nLooking at distances from current head (3,4) to food:\n1. (4,1): Manhattan distance = |4-3| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. (1,6): |1-3| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n3. (1,2): |1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n4. (2,5): |2-3| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 (closest)\n5. (1,1): |1-3| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe closest food is at (2,5) with distance 2. To reach (2,5) from (3,4):\n- Need to go left (decrease x) and up (increase y).\n- Current move options: Left to (2,4) or Up to (3,5).\n  - Left to (2,4): then next move could be Up to (2,5).\n  - Up to (3,5): then next move could be Left to (2,5).\n\nBoth sequences take two moves to reach the food. However, moving Up first might be slightly better because:\n- After Up to (3,5), Left to (2,5) is straightforward.\n- After Left to (2,4), Up to (2,5) is also straightforward, but (2,4) is closer to other foods like (1,2) and (1,1), which might be useful later.\n\nBut since (2,5) is the closest, let's aim for that. Both initial moves are equally good in terms of steps to (2,5), but moving Up first might keep more options open.\n\nAlternatively, moving Left first could be better because:\n- From (2,4), we can go Up to (2,5) next.\n- Also, (2,4) is closer to (1,2) and (1,1), which are other foods.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems slightly better as it positions us closer to multiple foods.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nIf we move Left to (2,4):\n- Next turn, head at (2,4), tail at (3,4).\n- Possible moves from (2,4):\n  - Left (L): (1,4) — check walls: (1,4) is not a wall.\n  - Up (U): (2,5) — food at (2,5)!\n  - Down (D): (2,3) — safe.\n  - Cannot go Right (opposite of Left).\n\nSo next turn, we can eat the food at (2,5) by moving Up.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that moving Left now sets us up to eat the closest food at (2,5) next turn, and all immediate moves are safe, the best immediate action is to move Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The next position if it continues Left would be (1,4). \n\nBut before deciding the move, I need to consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot move Right in the next turn.\n- **Possible Directions**: From (2,4), the snake can move:\n  - Up (U): (2,5)\n  - Down (D): (2,3)\n  - Left (L): (1,4)\n  - Right (R): (3,4) — but this is the current body position and also the opposite of Left, so it's invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n#### Option 1: Continue Left (L) to (1,4)\n- **Check for Walls**: (1,4) is not listed as a wall or obstacle.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: The body is at (3,4), so no collision.\n- **Check for Food**: (1,4) is not listed as a food position.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Up (U) to (2,5)\n- **Check for Walls**: (2,5) is not a wall.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: The body is at (3,4), so no collision.\n- **Check for Food**: (2,5) has food with value=1, life_span=6.\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: The snake's tail is at (3,4). The head is currently at (2,4), so the tail is adjacent (right side). If the head moves to (2,5), it's no longer adjacent to the tail. However, if the head eats the food at (2,5), the snake will grow, and the new tail will be at (3,4). The next head position would be (2,5), and the new tail would be (3,4). They are not adjacent, so no immediate collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe and rewards +1.\n\n#### Option 3: Move Down (D) to (2,3)\n- **Check for Walls**: (2,3) is not a wall.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: No collision.\n- **Check for Food**: No food here.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe but no reward.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Left (L)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, +1 reward.\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, no reward.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (2,5) to eat the positive food.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n\n- Current head: (2,4)\n- Current tail: (3,4) — adjacent (right side).\n- Tail cell (3,4) does not have any food listed.\n- The food is at (2,5), not at the tail.\n\nTherefore, the condition for Tail Reward Danger is not met here, so moving Up is safe.\n\n### Checking Other Constraints\n\n- **Life Span**: The food at (2,5) has a life span of 6. It's turn 8, but we don't know when it spawned. However, since it's still present, it's safe to assume it's available.\n- **No Reverse Move**: Moving Right is invalid, but Up, Down, Left are valid.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe optimal move is to go Up to eat the positive food at (2,5).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

No food listed there.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but (1,5) is not (x=1 > 0).\n   - Check internal obstacles: (1,5) is not listed.\n   - Check body collision: No body at (1,5).\n   - Food at (1,5)? No food listed there.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (3,5)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, but (3,5) is not (x=3 < 7).\n   - Check internal obstacles: (3,5) is not listed.\n   - Check body collision: No body at (3,5).\n   - Food at (3,5)? No food listed there.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable or beneficial:\n\n1. **(4,1)**: \n   - Distance from head (2,5): Δx=2, Δy=4. Too far to reach in one move.\n2. **(1,6)**:\n   - Distance: Δx=1, Δy=1. Could reach by moving Left then Up or vice versa, but not in one move.\n3. **(1,2)**:\n   - Distance: Δx=1, Δy=3. Not reachable in one move.\n4. **(1,1)**:\n   - Distance: Δx=1, Δy=4. Not reachable in one move.\n\nNone of the food items are adjacent to the current head position, so we cannot eat any food this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nWe should also consider future moves to avoid trapping ourselves:\n\n- Moving Up to (2,6):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,6): U (to (2,7) - wall), L (to (1,6)), R (to (3,6)).\n    - (3,6) is an internal obstacle, so R is blocked.\n    - U is blocked by wall.\n    - Only L to (1,6) is possible, where there's food (value=1).\n    - But moving to (1,6) next turn would eat the food, but we need to check if that's safe.\n    - After eating, the snake grows, so tail is at (2,4), new tail at (3,4), head at (1,6), body at (2,6), (2,5).\n    - Then, possible moves from (1,6): D (to (1,5)), R (to (2,6) - body collision, U (to (1,7) - wall).\n    - Only D is safe, but (1,5) has no food, and we might be limiting future options.\n\n- Moving Left to (1,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (1,5): U (to (1,6)), D (to (1,4)), R (to (2,5)).\n    - U to (1,6): can eat food (value=1), but same as above, may limit future moves.\n    - D to (1,4): safe, no food.\n    - R to (2,5): original head position, but body is now at (2,5) after move, so collision unless tail moves away.\n      - Current body: (2,4), (3,4). After moving left to (1,5), body is (2,5), (2,4).\n      - Then moving R to (2,5) collides with body.\n    - So from (1,5), only U and D are safe next moves.\n\n- Moving Right to (3,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,5): U (to (3,6) - obstacle), D (to (3,4) - tail is moving from (3,4) to (2,4), so safe), L (to (2,5)).\n    - U is blocked.\n    - D to (3,4): tail is at (3,4) but will move to (2,4), so (3,4) is safe.\n    - L to (2,5): body is at (2,5) after move, so collision unless tail moves away.\n      - After moving right to (3,5), body is (2,5), (2,4).\n      - Then moving L to (2,5) collides with body.\n    - So from (3,5), only D is safe next move.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nGiven that no food is reachable this turn, we want to choose a move that keeps the most options open for future moves:\n\n- **Up (2,6)**:\n  - Next turn only L to (1,6) is safe, which eats food but may limit further.\n- **Left (1,5)**:\n  - Next turn can choose U (to eat food) or D (safe).\n- **Right (3,5)**:\n  - Next turn only D is safe.\n\nLeft seems to offer the most flexibility next turn (can choose to eat or not). Up is also okay but forces us to eat next turn which may not be ideal. Right is the most limiting.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nWe must ensure that the chosen move doesn't lead to immediate death next turn:\n\n- **Left to (1,5)**:\n  - Next turn if we go U to (1,6) to eat food:\n    - Snake grows: head at (1,6), body at (1,5), (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n    - Then next moves from (1,6): D to (1,5) - body collision, R to (2,6) - body at (2,5), so safe, U to (1,7) - wall.\n    - So only R is safe, which may not be bad.\n  - Alternatively, can choose D to (1,4) to avoid eating.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above, moving **Left (L)** to (1,5) seems the best option as it keeps the most options open for the next turn without immediately forcing us into a corner.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(1,6): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (1,2): value=1, life_span=1\n3. (1,1): value=7, life_span=1\n4. (2,6): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (1,5), the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (1,6)\n- Down (D): (1,4)\n- Left (L): (0,5) — but x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- Right (R): (2,5) — but (2,5) is the snake's body (second segment), so this would cause a collision unless it's the tail that's moving away.\n\n**Current direction is L**, so the opposite direction is R (Right). According to the rules, we cannot instantly reverse, so R is not allowed next.\n\nSo, valid moves are U, D.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Option 1: Up (U) to (1,6)**\n- Check if (1,6) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: yes.\n  - Not a body part: snake is at [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4)], so no.\n  - Food at (1,6): value=1, life_span=1.\n    - Eating this food: reward=+1, length increases by 1.\n    - Check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n      - Current tail is at (2,4).\n      - Adjacent to head (1,5)? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,5) is adjacent to (2,5), (0,5), (1,6), (1,4).\n      - Tail is at (2,4), which is diagonally from (1,5), not adjacent (doesn't share an edge), so no danger.\n    - Safe to eat.\n- After moving:\n  - New head: (1,6)\n  - Body grows to: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n  - Tail was at (2,4), now moves forward, so new tail is (2,5)? Wait, no: when eating, the tail doesn't move, the snake grows.\n    - Actually, the length increases by 1, so the tail stays where it is, and a new segment is added where the head was.\n    - So new positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n    - Next turn, if no eating, tail moves away from (2,4).\n- No immediate collision risks.\n\n**Option 2: Down (D) to (1,4)**\n- Check if (1,4) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: yes.\n  - Not a body part: no snake parts at (1,4).\n  - No food at (1,4) (from given food positions).\n- After moving:\n  - New head: (1,4)\n  - Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n  - Tail (2,4) moves away, so removed.\n- No reward, just moving safely.\n\n**Option 3: Right (R) to (2,5)**\n- Invalid because:\n  - Opposite direction is not allowed (current is L, cannot go R).\n  - Also, (2,5) is the body segment, so collision unless it's the tail moving away, but it's not the tail (tail is at (2,4)), so collision.\n\n**Option 4: Left (L) to (0,5)**\n- x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Up (U)**: Get +1 score, grow length by 1.

Here's what I gather:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are five specific cells that are also walls: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)].\n     - Head is at (1,6).\n     - Next segment is at (1,5), then (2,5), and tail at (2,4).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Two pieces of food are present:\n     - (1,1): value = 7, life_span = 1.\n     - (2,6): value = 9, life_span = 1.\n   - Both foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Current Snake Movement\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,6), moving Up (\"U\"). The possible moves from here are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (1,7). But y=7 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (1,5). This is the body segment right after the head, so moving here would cause a collision (unless it's the tail, which it's not).\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (0,6). x=0 is a wall, invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (2,6). Let's check this:\n   - Is (2,6) a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7; y=0,7; and specific internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (2,6) is not listed.\n   - Is (2,6) occupied by the snake's body? Current body positions: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4). No, (2,6) is free.\n   - Is there food at (2,6)? Yes, with value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Up, and we cannot instantly reverse (from Up to Down), the possible non-reverse moves are Left and Right (since Up is blocked by wall and Down is reverse).\n\nBut actually, the current direction is Up, and the possible moves are:\n\n- Continue Up: (1,7) → wall → invalid.\n- Turn Left: (0,6) → wall → invalid.\n- Turn Right: (2,6) → valid, as checked above.\n- Down: Reverse direction → not allowed.\n\nSo, the only valid move is Right to (2,6).\n\n### Checking for Food at (2,6)\n\nThere is positive food at (2,6) with value=9 and life_span=1. Eating it would:\n- Increase score by +9.\n- Increase snake length by +1 (new segment added where the tail was).\n\nBut we must check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is the tail cell (2,4) a positive food?\n   - Head is at (1,6), tail is at (2,4). Are they adjacent?\n     - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1, or same y and x differs by 1.\n     - (1,6) and (2,4): x differs by 1, y differs by 2 → not adjacent.\n   - Also, tail cell (2,4) doesn't have food listed, so no danger here.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- The other food at (1,1) is too far and not reachable in this move.\n- Moving Right to (2,6) is safe and allows eating high-value food (value=9).\n- After moving, the snake's new positions would be: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)] (assuming the tail moves forward, but since we eat food, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, but the tail itself doesn't move. Wait, need to clarify snake growth mechanics.)\n\nActually, when the snake eats food:\n- The head moves to the food cell.\n- A new body segment is added where the tail was (so the tail doesn't move).\n- So new positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)] (tail remains at (2,4), but a new segment is added where the tail was, which is the same, so length increases by 1.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions After Move\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), the new head is at (2,6), and the body is at (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4). \n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Does (2,6) overlap with any body part? No, body is at (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4).\n- Is (2,6) a wall? No.\n- Is next move restricted? Next turn, the head is at (2,6), coming from (1,6), so direction is Right. Possible moves next turn would be Up, Down, Right (no Left, as that's reverse).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move is Right to (2,6), which also allows eating high-value positive food without any immediate dangers.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 12 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot go beyond these coordinates.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)].\n     - Head at (2,6), next segment at (1,6), then (1,5), (2,5), and tail at (2,4).\n   - Current head direction: Right (R). This means the last move was to the right (from (1,6) to (2,6)).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food present: at (1,1) with value=6 and life_span=1.\n     - Value is positive (+6), so eating it increases length by 1 and score by 6.\n     - Life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,6) and direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (2,6) → (2,7)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,6) → (2,5)\n- **Left (L)**: (2,6) → (1,6)\n- **Right (R)**: (2,6) → (3,6)\n\nBut we have movement constraints:\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to the current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. Therefore, cannot move Left (L) next.\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U): (2,6) → (2,7)\n- Check walls: y=7 is a border wall. So, moving to (2,7) is a wall collision → death.\n- **Not safe**.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D): (2,6) → (2,5)\n- Check walls: (2,5) is not a wall.\n- Check snake body: Snake segments are at (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4).\n  - (2,5) is the 4th segment (from head: positions[3]).\n  - Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly, but there's an exception: if it's the tail segment, and the tail moves away, it's safe.\n  - The tail is at (2,4). The segment at (2,5) is not the tail; it's the segment before the tail. So, moving into (2,5) would collide with the body → death.\n- **Not safe**.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R): (2,6) → (3,6)\n- Check walls: (3,6) is an internal obstacle (given in the list: (3,6) is a wall).\n- So, moving to (3,6) is a wall collision → death.\n- **Not safe**.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, all allowed moves (U, D, R) lead to death. The only move left is Left (L), but it's the opposite of the current direction R, so it's not allowed.\n\nWait a minute, this seems like a dead end. But let me double-check the rules:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so cannot move L next.\n  \nBut if all other moves lead to death, is the snake forced to move left and die? Or is there another interpretation?\n\nLooking back at the snake positions:\n- Head at (2,6), came from (1,6) (direction R).\n- Next segment is (1,6), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,4).\n\nIf we move Left (L) to (1,6):\n- (1,6) is the second segment of the snake.\n- Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail.\n- The tail is at (2,4), so (1,6) is not the tail → collision → death.\n\nSo, moving left is also deadly.\n\nThis seems like a situation where the snake is trapped with no safe moves. But let me check if there's any misinterpretation.\n\n### Checking Food Interaction\n\nThe only food is at (1,1), which is far away (current head at (2,6)). Even if we could move towards it, we can't reach it in one move, and it will disappear after this turn (life_span=1).\n\n### Re-examining Snake Body Collision\n\nIs moving into (2,5) always deadly? The rule says:\n- Body collision (head touches any body segment). But you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nIn our case:\n- Moving to (2,5): (2,5) is the 4th segment (positions[3]), not the tail (tail is positions[4] = (2,4)).\n- So, moving into (2,5) is colliding with a non-tail body segment → death.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n- U: wall collision → death.\n- D: body collision → death.\n- R: wall collision → death.\n- L: body collision (not tail) → death.\n\nThere are no safe moves available. The snake is trapped and will die no matter what move is chosen. \n\nHowever, since the instruction is to provide an action, and assuming that the snake must make a move (even if all lead to death), we might as well choose one arbitrarily. \n\nGiven that, I'll choose to move Right (R), even though it leads to a wall collision, because it's one of the allowed directions (not opposite to current direction).\n\nBut wait, moving Right is into a wall, which is certain death. Maybe choosing a move that might have been intended to be safe is better, but in this case, none are.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the snake can choose not to move (though the rules imply it must move one cell per turn), but that's not an option here.\n\nGiven the strict rules, the only possible action is to choose one of U, D, R, all leading to death. \n\nSince the food is irrelevant here (can't reach it in one move), and all moves are deadly, I'll choose:\n\n\\boxed{R} \n\n(Even though it's certain death, as per the rules, we must choose an action, and R is a legal direction not opposite to current direction.) \n\n**Note**: This seems like a designed trap where the snake cannot survive the next move. In a real game, this might indicate a flaw in earlier moves leading to this position.",
