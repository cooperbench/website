        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, and cars move left or right with given speeds.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn and which positions are safe for each freeway at each time.\n\nThe game starts at turn t_1, which is given as t_0 = 0. So current turn is 0, position is (0,0).\n\nCars are defined for freeways 1 to 8, each with some cars. For each car, at turn t_1 (which is 0), we have the head and tail positions. Since they're moving, I need to compute their positions at future turns.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Meaning the car covers position x=0 at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move, you are on y_T during turn T, and you check for collision on y_T at that time. Then you move to y_{T+1}, but you're not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 in Span(T) for some car on freeway k.\n\nSpan(T) is the position at turn T.\n\nFor a car, at turn t_1, we have initial head and tail. Since they're moving, at time T, the span changes based on speed and direction.\n\nFor left-moving cars, direction left? The direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\"? In the car state, it says \"direction d\", and in the table, for all cars, it's \"right\" or is it?\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48,-59, right, 4), etc. So direction is specified, and for all, it's \"right\" except... let me list:\n\nFreeway 1: all right\n\nFreeway 2: all right\n\nFreeway 3: all right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: all right\n\nFreeway 6: (48,37,right,3) — head 48, tail 37? That can't be right for right-moving.\n\nI think there might be a confusion with head and tail.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, τ] to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nBut in the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor a right-moving car, since it's moving right, the head should be on the right, so tail < head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head on left, tail on right? Let's see the values.\n\nTake freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\n-48 and -59, since it's right-moving, and -48 > -59, so head is -48, tail is -59, so at t_1, span is [-59, -48]? But according to the rule, for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ should be tail, h head.\n\nIn the description: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail, ...), so for right-moving, head is larger than tail if moving right.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, car: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSince direction right, tail should be less than head. -59 < -48, yes, so tail τ = -59, head h = -48.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 4(T-0), -48 + 4(T-0)] since t_1=0.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but here all seem to be right-moving.\n\nAnother example, freeway 6: (48,37,right,3) — head 48, tail 37, since 37<48, tail τ=37, head h=48, span [37,48] at t=0.\n\nBut direction right, so moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (-48,-71,right,24) — head -48, tail -71, τ=-71, h=-48, span [-71,-48] at t=0.\n\nNow, for the player, we start at y=0, and need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a freeway y, we need to ensure that no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince cars are on specific freeways, for each freeway, we need to know when position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for each time t, is there a car on k such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nIf yes, then that (k,t) is unsafe; we cannot be on freeway k at time t.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nThen, we need a path from y=0 at t=0 to y=9 at some time H, with actions at each step.\n\ny_{t} is the position at turn t.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1, since at t=H-1, we move to y_H=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k=1 to 8, for which times t the position x=0 is occupied, meaning collision would occur if on k at t.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need to check each car on that freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\nCar A: head -48, tail -59, dir right, speed 4 → τ=-59, h=-48, span at t: [-59 + 4t, -48 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4t ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4t\n\nSo -59 + 4t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 4t\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4t ≤ 0 => 4t ≤ 59 => t ≤ 59/4 = 14.75, so t <= 14 since t integer? t is turn, integer I assume.\n\nt from 0,1,2,... integer turns.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 ≤ -48 + 4t => 48 ≤ 4t => t ≥ 12.\n\nSo t >=12 and t <=14.\n\nt >=12 and t <=14.\n\nNow, car B: (-12,-23,right,4) → τ=-23, h=-12, span at t: [-23 +4t, -12 +4t]\n\n0 in span: -23+4t ≤ 0 ≤ -12+4t\n\nFirst: -23+4t ≤0 => 4t ≤23 => t <= 23/4=5.75, t<=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+4t => 12 <=4t => t>=3\n\nSo t>=3 and t<=5\n\nCar C: (24,13,right,4) → head 24, tail 13, τ=13, h=24, span [13+4t, 24+4t]\n\n0 in span: 13+4t <=0 <=24+4t? But 13+4t >=13>0 for t>=0, so 0 <= 13+4t always false since 0 < 13+4t, so 0 never in span. Similarly, min is 13 at t=0, increasing, so always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when car A covers 0 at t=12,13,14 or car B at t=3,4,5.\n\nCar A: t=12,13,14\n\nCar B: t=3,4,5\n\nCar C: never\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars are identical: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSo same as above, unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 3: cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37, τ=37, h=48, speed 6, span [37+6t, 48+6t]\n\n0 in span: 37+6t <=0 <=48+6t? 37+6t >=37>0, so never.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) τ=1, h=12, span [1+6t, 12+6t]\n\n0 in span: 1+6t <=0 <=12+6t\n\n1+6t <=0 => 6t <= -1, impossible since t>=0. So never.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) head -24, tail -35, τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35+6t, -24+6t]\n\n0 in span: -35+6t <=0 <= -24+6t\n\nFirst: -35+6t <=0 => 6t <=35 => t <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, t<=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+6t => 24 <=6t => t>=4\n\nSo t>=4 and t<=5\n\nThus for freeway 3, unsafe only at t=4,5 from this car.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, unsafe at t=4,5\n\nNow freeway 5: cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) span [37+12t,48+12t], min 37>0, never cover 0.\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,12) span [1+12t,12+12t], min 1>0, never.\n\nThird: (-24,-35,right,12) τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35+12t, -24+12t]\n\n0 in span: -35+12t <=0 <= -24+12t\n\nFirst: -35+12t <=0 => 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, t<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12t => 24 <=12t => t>=2\n\nSo t=2\n\nt>=2 and t<=2, so only t=2.\n\nThus freeway 5 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car: (48,37,right,3) → head 48, tail 37, τ=37, h=48, speed 3, span [37+3t, 48+3t]\n\nAlways positive, min 37>0, so never covers 0. So freeway 6 always safe? Is that right?\n\nSpan [37+3t,48+3t], for t=0, [37,48], t=1 [40,51], etc, all greater than 37, so x=0 never in, yes, always safe.\n\nBut freeway 6 has only one car, which is always to the right, so yes, no car covers x=0 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 7: (-48,-71,right,24) → head -48, tail -71, τ=-71, h=-48, speed 24, span [-71+24t, -48+24t]\n\n0 in span: -71+24t <=0 <= -48+24t\n\nFirst: -71+24t <=0 => 24t <=71 => t <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, t<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+24t => 48 <=24t => t>=2\n\nSo t=2\n\nt>=2 and t<=2, so only t=2 unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Cars: (-48,-71,right,24) same, so unsafe only at t=2.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car? In the table: for freeway 8: (-48,-71,right,24) only one, same as freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: one car, freeway 8: one car, both same parameters.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at t=2 only.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same, t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe t=4,5\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe t=4,5\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe t=2\n\nFreeway 6: always safe (no unsafe times)\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe t=2\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe t=2\n\nFreeway 6 is always safe, meaning at all times, no car covers x=0.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at t=0 to y=9 at some t=H.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, so y changes by -1,0,+1, bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to reach 9, and 0 to 9 is 8 steps up, but we can go down or stay, so minimum H is at least 9, if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait to avoid unsafe times.\n\nThe minimal number of up moves is 9, since from 0 to 9, each up increases y by 1, so at least 9 up actions. But we can have stay or down, which don't help progress, so H >= 9, and if we only go up, H=9, y_t = t for t=0 to 9, with y_9=9.\n\nBut we need to check if this path is safe, meaning for each t from 1 to 8, when on freeway y_t, it must be safe at that time.\n\ny_t: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nStart t=0, y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nt=1, y=1 (if we go up), on freeway 1 at t=1.\n\nIs freeway 1 safe at t=1?\n\nFrom above, freeway 1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14; t=1 not in, so safe? Earlier we have unsafe only at those times, so at t=1, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=2, y=2, on freeway 2 at t=2.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14; t=2 not in, so safe.\n\nt=3, y=3, on freeway 3 at t=3.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at t=4,5; t=3 not in, so safe.\n\nt=4, y=4, on freeway 4 at t=4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at t=4,5; t=4 is unsafe! Oh, so at t=4, on freeway 4, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, if we go straight up, at t=4, y=4, freeway 4 unsafe, crash.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up every turn, at t=4 we are on y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps we can delay or something.\n\nSince freeway 6 is always safe, we could go to freeway 6 and stay or something, but we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each y (freeway).\n\ny=1: freeway 1, unsafe t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: freeway 2, same, unsafe t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=3: freeway 3, unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=4: freeway 4, unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=5: freeway 5, unsafe t=2\n\ny=6: freeway 6, always safe\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe t=2\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe t=2\n\nNow, we need a sequence of y_t from t=0 to H, with y_0=0, y_H=9, and for each t, if y_t between 1 and 8, it must be safe at time t.\n\ny_t is the position during turn t.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAt t=H, y_H=9, which is safe, since not freeway.\n\nThe actions: from y_t to y_{t+1} by action at t.\n\nWe need to minimize H, so we want to reach as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal y_t would be to go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe points.\n\nSince from t=0, we can go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=1 must be safe. Freeway 1 safe at t=1, since unsafe starts at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, t=2: y=2, freeway 2 safe at t=2? Unsafe at t=3,4,5,... so t=2 safe.\n\nt=3: y=3, freeway 3 unsafe at t=4,5, not t=3, so safe at t=3.\n\nt=4: y=4, but freeway 4 unsafe at t=4, so not safe. Problem.\n\nSo at t=4, we cannot be on y=4.\n\nOptions: at t=3, instead of going to y=4 at t=4, we could stay on y=3 or go down, but that might not help.\n\nWe could go slower.\n\nFor example, at t=0, start y=0.\n\nt=0, action: we can choose to stay or go up. If we stay, y=0 at t=1, but y=0 is safe, but we don't progress.\n\nBetter to go up if possible.\n\nt=0: action U, to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1: now on y=1 at t=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we can choose action for t=2.\n\nIf we go up, y=2 at t=2.\n\nOn y=2 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, if we go up, to y=3 at t=3.\n\nOn y=3 at t=3, safe.\n\nNow at t=3, we need to go to y=4 at t=4, but y=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=4 at t=4.\n\nAt t=3, we could stay on y=3, so action S, then y=3 at t=4.\n\nBut on y=3 at t=4: freeway 3 unsafe at t=4? Yes, t=4 is unsafe for y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo at t=4, on y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down at t=3, to y=2 at t=4.\n\nOn y=2 at t=4: freeway 2 unsafe at t=4? Yes, t=4 is unsafe for y=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=3,4,5.\n\nt=4 unsafe.\n\nSo both staying or going down at t=3 lead to unsafe at t=4 on y=3 or y=2.\n\nWe could have gone slower earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=1, after being on y=1 at t=1, we could stay on y=1 at t=2? Action S at t=1, then y=1 at t=2.\n\nOn y=1 at t=2: freeway 1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,... t=2 not unsafe, so safe? t=2 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so safe.\n\nThen at t=2, we can go up to y=2 at t=3.\n\nOn y=2 at t=3: freeway 2 unsafe at t=3, yes, t=3 unsafe for y=2.\n\nCrash.\n\nAt t=2, after being on y=1 at t=2 (if we stayed), we could go up to y=2 at t=3, but unsafe.\n\nOr we could stay again or go down.\n\nBut going down to y=0 at t=3, but y=0 safe, but we are lower.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps we need to avoid being on certain y at certain times.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we could go to y=6 quickly and then to y=9.\n\nBut y=6 to y=9 is 3 up moves.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=6 at some time when it is safe, but y=6 always safe.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\nBut the freeways above might have unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's see how to get to y=6.\n\nFrom y=0, we can go up step by step.\n\nBut the problem is around t=4.\n\nWe need to be not on y=3 or y=4 at t=4 and t=5, since both unsafe at those times.\n\ny=3 unsafe t=4,5; y=4 unsafe t=4,5.\n\nAlso, y=1 and y=2 unsafe at t=3,4,5.\n\ny=1 unsafe t=3,4,5; y=2 unsafe t=3,4,5.\n\nNow y=5 unsafe only at t=2.\n\ny=7 unsafe t=2; y=8 unsafe t=2.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nWe need to plan the path to avoid these.\n\nFor example, at t=2, we should not be on y=5,7,8 since unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=5,7,8 unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=5 unsafe t=2, y=7 unsafe t=2, y=8 unsafe t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, we might be on lower y.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4 and t=5, we should avoid y=1,2,3,4.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 all unsafe at t=4 and t=5? Let's see.\n\ny=1: unsafe t=3,4,5\n\ny=2: unsafe t=3,4,5\n\ny=3: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=4: unsafe t=4,5\n\nSo at t=4 and t=5, y=1,2,3,4 are all unsafe.\n\ny=5: unsafe only t=2, so at t=4,5, y=5 is safe? Freeway 5 unsafe only at t=2, so at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe only t=2, so at t=4,5 safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe only t=2, so at t=4,5 safe.\n\nSo at t=4 and t=5, the only safe freeways are y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are safe at t=4 and t=5.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nNow, we need to be on one of y=5,6,7,8 at t=4 and t=5 to be safe.\n\nBut we start from y=0 at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=5 or above by t=4.\n\ny_t at t=4 must be at least 5 to be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y_t at least 5.\n\nNow, from t=0 to t=4, we have 4 actions to increase y.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAfter 4 actions, y_4.\n\ny_4 >=5 needed.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so with 4 up moves, y_4=4, but y=4 is unsafe at t=4.\n\ny_4=4 is not safe.\n\nWe need y_4 >=5.\n\nBut with 4 actions from t=0 to t=3, we set y_1 to y_4.\n\nt=0: action for y_1\n\nt=1: action for y_2\n\nt=2: action for y_3\n\nt=3: action for y_4\n\nSo y_4 depends on actions at t=0,1,2,3.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter action at t=0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nSimilarly, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1, etc.\n\nTo have y_4 >=5, since y_0=0, we need to have at least 5 up moves in the first 4 actions? No.\n\ny_4 = y_0 + sum_{i=0 to 3} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i <=1, so y_4 <= 4 if no down, but can be less.\n\ny_4 >=5 only if we have at least 5 up moves, but only 4 actions, impossible? 4 actions, each can increase by at most 1, so y_4 <= y_0 + 4*1 = 4.\n\ny_4 <= 4, since y_0=0, and each action can add at most 1 to y.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, Δy_t = -1,0,1.\n\nSo y_4 = 0 + sum_{k=0 to 3} Δy_k <= 0 + 4*1 =4\n\nSimilarly, y_4 >= 0 + 4*(-1) = -4, but bounded to 0, so y_4 between 0 and 4.\n\nThus y_4 <=4, so y_4 cannot be 5 or more.\n\nTherefore, at t=4, we must be on y=0,1,2,3, or 4.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4 are all unsafe at t=4, and y=0 is not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo the only safe position at t=4 is y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y=0,1,2,3,4 are possible, but y=1,2,3,4 unsafe, so only y=0 or y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y_5 <= y_0 + 5*1 =5, so y_5 <=5.\n\ny_5 >=0.\n\nIf y_5=0,1,2,3,4: y=0 safe, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe at t=5.\n\ny=5: at t=5, freeway 5 safe? Unsafe only at t=2, so at t=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 safe.\n\nBut y_5 <=5, so possible y_5=0 or 5.\n\ny_5=0 or 5.\n\ny_5=0 safe, y_5=5 safe at t=5.\n\nNow back to t=4.\n\nAt t=4, we must be on y=0 to be safe, since y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo at t=4, y_4 must be 0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y_5 can be 0 or 5.\n\nNow, y_4=0.\n\ny_4=0 means that at turn t=4, position is (0,0).\n\nHow to achieve y_4=0.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t=0.\n\ny_4=0.\n\nNow, the actions: from t=0 to t=3, we need to have y_4=0.\n\ny_4 depends on actions.\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\ny_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\nSet y_4=0.\n\nAlso, we need to be safe at each step.\n\nFor example, at t=0: y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_0, to y_1.\n\ny_1 must be safe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, t=1: on y_1, safe.\n\nAction to y_2, and so on.\n\nNow, y_4=0.\n\nSince y_4=0, and y_3 + Δy_3 = y_4=0, so Δy_3 must be such that y_3 + Δy_3 =0.\n\ny_3 >=0, so if y_3=0, Δy_3=0; if y_3=1, Δy_3=-1, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier.\n\nBut we also need to consider other times.\n\nFirst, let's list the times when we need to avoid certain y.\n\nAt t=2, we should not be on y=5,7,8 because unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=5,7,8 unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=6 safe at t=2.\n\nNow, let's plan from start.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to choose action to go to y_1.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y_1=1.\n\nAt t=1, on y=1, which is safe at t=1? Yes, since unsafe starts t=3.\n\nIf S, y_1=0, safe but no progress.\n\nIf D, y_1=0? y_0=0, D would be y_1 =0 -1? But y min 0, so y_1=0 if D? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy=-1, but y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy)), so y_{t+1} =0 if y_t=0 and D or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U or S keeps 9.\n\nSo at t=0, y=0:\n\n- a_0=U: y_1=1\n\n- a_0=S: y_1=0\n\n- a_0=D: y_1=0\n\nSimilarly, other positions.\n\nNow, to make progress, better to go up when possible.\n\nBut at t=1, y=1 is safe, so we can go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAssume we do that: a_0=U, y_1=1 at t=1, safe.\n\nNow t=1: on y=1, safe.\n\nAction a_1 for y_2.\n\nPossible: U to y=2, S to y=1, D to y=0.\n\nNow, at t=2, where we are must be safe.\n\ny=2 at t=2: freeway 2 unsafe at t=3,4,5, not t=2, so safe.\n\ny=1 at t=2: similarly, freeway 1 safe at t=2.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nBut we want to go up, so possible to go to y=2 at t=2.\n\na_1=U, y_2=2.\n\nAt t=2, on y=2, safe.\n\nNow, we need to think about t=4.\n\nAt t=2, we are on y=2.\n\nAction a_2 for y_3.\n\ny_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\ny_3 must be safe at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, which y are safe?\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=3: unsafe? Freeway 3 unsafe at t=4,5, not t=3, so safe at t=3.\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=4,5, not t=3, so safe at t=3.\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=2, not t=3, so safe at t=3.\n\netc.\n\nBut at t=3, we need to be on a y that is safe at t=3.\n\nSpecifically:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=3,4,5 → unsafe at t=3\n\ny=2: unsafe t=3,4,5 → unsafe at t=3\n\ny=3: unsafe t=4,5 → safe at t=3 (since not 4 or 5)\n\ny=4: unsafe t=4,5 → safe at t=3\n\ny=5: unsafe only t=2 → safe at t=3\n\ny=6: safe\n\ny=7: unsafe t=2 → safe at t=3\n\ny=8: unsafe t=2 → safe at t=3\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=3, unsafe only for y=1 and y=2.\n\nSo we must not be on y=1 or y=2 at t=3.\n\nWe are at t=2 on y=2.\n\nSo at t=2, we need to move to y_3 not 1 or 2.\n\nOptions: from y=2, action a_2:\n\n- U: to y=3\n\n- S: to y=2\n\n- D: to y=1\n\nBut y=3 is safe at t=3, y=2 unsafe, y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo we must go up to y=3.\n\na_2=U, y_3=3.\n\nAt t=3, on y=3, which is safe at t=3.\n\nNow, at t=3, we need to choose action for y_4.\n\nBut we know that at t=4, we must be on y=0 to be safe, since all other unsafe.\n\ny_4 must be 0.\n\ny_3=3, so to have y_4=0, we need Δy_3 = -3? But Δy can only be -1,0,1.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_3=3, y_4=0, so Δy_3 must be -3, but impossible, since |Δy|<=1.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3, with Δy_3 in {-1,0,1}, so y_4 between 2 and 4.\n\nCannot be 0.\n\nContradiction.\n\nEarlier we concluded that at t=4, y_4 must be 0, but from y_3=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nAll of which are unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=2,3,4 all unsafe at t=4.\n\nAnd we cannot reach y=0 from y=3 in one step.\n\nThus, it's impossible to be safe at t=4 with this path.\n\nBut we need to be at y=0 at t=4.\n\nHow can we be at y=0 at t=4?\n\nWe must have y_4=0.\n\ny_4=0.\n\nNow, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\nSince y_4=0, and y_3 >=0, we must have y_3=0 or 1.\n\nIf y_3=0, then Δy_3=0\n\nIf y_3=1, then Δy_3=-1\n\nSimilarly, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2, etc.\n\nAlso, at each step, we must be safe.\n\nNow, from the beginning.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe.\n\nWe need y_4=0.\n\nSuppose at t=0, we do not go up immediately.\n\nFor example, at t=0, action S or D, both lead to y_1=0.\n\nThen at t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we can go to y=1 with U.\n\ny_1=1 at t=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, action U, to y_2=2 at t=2, safe as before.\n\nThen at t=2, on y=2, we need to go to y_3.\n\ny_3 must be such that we can reach y_4=0.\n\ny_3 must be 0 or 1.\n\nBut at t=2, we are on y=2.\n\nSo to have y_3=0 or 1, action: D to y=1, or S to y=2, or U to y=3.\n\nSo we can do D to y=1.\n\nThen y_3=1.\n\nAt t=3, on y=1.\n\nBut at t=3, y=1 is unsafe! Because freeway 1 unsafe at t=3.\n\nCrash.\n\nIf at t=2, we do S, y_3=2, but at t=3, y=2 unsafe.\n\nCrash.\n\nIf we do U to y=3, then at t=3, y=3 safe, but then from there, to y_4, we can only go to 2,3,4, not to 0.\n\nSo cannot reach y_4=0.\n\nThus, from this point, we cannot have y_4=0 if we went to y=1 and y=2.\n\nSuppose at t=0, we stay at y=0.\n\na_0=S, y_1=0 at t=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we could go to y=1 with U, y_2=1 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, on y=1.\n\nNow, at t=2, y=1 must be safe? Freeway 1 unsafe at t=3,4,5, not t=2, so safe at t=2.\n\nThen action a_2 for y_3.\n\ny_3 must be 0 or 1 for y_4=0.\n\nAlso, at t=3, y_3 must be safe, so not y=1 or 2.\n\ny_3 must be 0 or 1 for y_4=0, but at t=3, y=1 unsafe, y=0 safe.\n\nSo y_3 must be 0.\n\nThen y_4=0 with Δy_3=0.\n\nNow, at t=2, we are on y=1.\n\nTo have y_3=0, we need Δy_2 = -1, so action D, to y_3=0.\n\nThen at t=3, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, action for y_4, to have y_4=0, so action S or D, y_4=0.\n\nThen at t=4, on y=0, safe.\n\nNow, at t=5, we need to be safe.\n\ny_5 must be 0 or 5, as earlier.\n\nNow, from y_4=0, we can go to y_5=0 or 1.\n\ny_5=0 or 1.\n\nBut at t=5, y=1 is unsafe (since freeway 1 unsafe at t=5), y=0 safe.\n\nSo we can stay at y=0 at t=5, or go to y=1 but unsafe, so must stay or go down, but y=0, down or stay to 0.\n\nSo y_5=0.\n\nThen we are stuck at y=0, not progressing.\n\nWe need to eventually go up.\n\nBut at t=5, we can go to y=5? But from y_4=0, to y_5, we can only go to y=0 or 1.\n\nCannot reach y=5 in one step.\n\nSo we are stuck at low y.\n\nTo reach y=5 at t=5, we need to be higher earlier.\n\nBut at t=4, we are at y=0, so at t=4, action U, to y_5=1 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nIf we do nothing, y_5=0.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=5 at t=5 from here.\n\nThe only way to be at y=5 at t=5 is to have been higher at t=4, but at t=4 we are at y=0.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at t=5 if at t=4 we are at y=0.\n\nThus, for t=5, we can only be at y=0 or y=1 from previous, but y=1 unsafe at t=5, so only y=0 safe at t=5 in this case.\n\nBut we need to move up eventually.\n\nWe need to be at y=5 or above at t=5.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=5, we need y_4 such that y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4 =5, so y_4 must be 4,5, or6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, we are at y=0, so y_4=0, then y_5 <=1, cannot be 5.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be safe at both t=4 and t=5 with the constraints.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother idea: at t=4, we don't have to be at y=0; we can be at y=5,6,7,8, but earlier I concluded that y_4 <=4, so impossible.\n\ny_4 <=4, and y=5,6,7,8 are above 4, so impossible to be on them at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y_5 <=5, so can be on y=5.\n\nBut at t=4, only y=0 is safe among possible positions.\n\nBut we can't reach y=0 from higher positions in the required steps.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 at t=4, but y_4 <=4, impossible.\n\nUnless we start moving down earlier, but we start from 0.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go up to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, go up to y=2 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, instead of going to y=3, go down to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, on y=1, but unsafe at t=3.\n\nCrash.\n\nOr at t=2, go down to y=1, but at t=2, on y=1 is safe, but at t=3, if on y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo from t=2, go down to y=1 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nGo to y=0 at t=3.\n\nAt t=2, on y=2, action D, to y=1 at t=3? y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2, if a_2=D, Δy=-1, y_2=2, y_3=1.\n\nThen at t=3, on y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf a_2=D from y=2, to y=1 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nIf a_2=S, to y=2 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nIf a_2=U, to y=3 at t=3, safe, but then at t=4, on y=4 if U, unsafe.\n\nSo no good.\n\nPerhaps at t=1, we don't go to y=2.\n\nAt t=1, on y=1, we can stay at y=1 for t=2.\n\nAt t=2, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, we can go down to y=0 at t=3.\n\nAction a_2=D, y_3=0.\n\nThen at t=3, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, action to y_4.\n\nTo have y_4=0, action S or D, y_4=0.\n\nAt t=4, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, action for y_5.\n\nWe can go up to y=1 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr stay at y=0.\n\nBut not progress.\n\nOr from t=4, we can go up multiple times, but at t=5, y=1 unsafe, so we have to stay at y=0 or go down, but no.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nUnless we can reach y=5 at t=5.\n\nBut from y_4=0, to y_5=5, impossible.\n\nSo we need to be higher at t=4.\n\nBut y_4 <=4, so maximum y_4=4, but unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe option at t=4 is y=0, but from there, we can't reach high y fast enough for t=5.\n\nAt t=5, we can be on y=5, which is safe, if we can reach it.\n\nBut to reach y=5 at t=5, we need y_4=4 or 5 or 6, but y_4<=4, so y_4=4 or 5, but y_4=4 unsafe at t=4, so we can't be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nIf y_4=4, unsafe.\n\nIf y_4=5, impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at t=4, and we cannot be on y=5 at t=5 if y_4=4, but y_4=4 not safe.\n\nThe only way to be on y=5 at t=5 is to have y_4=4, but y_4=4 unsafe at t=4, so we can't be there.\n\ny_4=4 or 5 or 6 for y_5=5, but y_4<=4, so y_4=4 or 5, y_4=5 impossible, so y_4=4, then a_4=U, y_5=5.\n\nBut at t=4, on y=4, unsafe, so we can't do that.\n\nIf y_4=5, impossible.\n\nSo it is impossible to be on y=5 at t=5 because it requires being on y=4 at t=4, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for other high y.\n\nSo the only safe position at t=5 is y=0.\n\nThen we are stuck at y=0.\n\nBut that can't be; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I missed that at t=4 and t=5, we can be on y=6, but y_4<=4, so impossible for t=4.\n\nFor t=5, y_5<=5, so can be on y=5 or 6, but y=6 requires y_4=5 or6 or7, impossible since y_4<=4.\n\ny_5 <=5, so can be on y=5 or lower.\n\ny=5 at t=5 is safe, but as above, requires unsafe position at t=4.\n\nSo the only safe option is to be on y=0 at both t=4 and t=5, and then after t=5, we can start moving up.\n\nBut at t=5, the unsafe times for lower freeways are over except for t=12, etc, but we can go up.\n\nFor example, after t=5, we can go up to y=9.\n\nLet's see the unsafe times.\n\nFor y=1 and2, unsafe at t=3,4,5 and also at t=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAfter t=5, for t=6 to 11, the lower freeways are safe, I think.\n\nLet's list for each y the unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: same, t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=3: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=4: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=5: unsafe only t=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe only t=2\n\ny=8: unsafe only t=2\n\nFor t>=6, except for t=12,13,14 for y=1,2, but y=1,2 are low, we can avoid them.\n\nSo after t=5, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to be at y=0 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo let's set that.\n\nAt t=4, y_4=0\n\nAt t=5, y_5=0\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, how to get to y_4=0 and y_5=0.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=3.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAt t=0, action: to have y_1.\n\nSuppose we do a_0=S or D, y_1=0\n\nAt t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_1: to y_2.\n\nIf we go U, to y_2=1 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen action a_2: to y_3.\n\nTo have y_4=0, and y_3 must be 0 or 1.\n\nBut at t=3, y_3 must be safe, so not 1 or 2, so must be 0.\n\nThus y_3=0.\n\nSo from y_2=1, we need to go to y_3=0, action D.\n\nThen at t=3, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen action a_3: to y_4, to have y_4=0, action S or D, y_4=0.\n\nAt t=4, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, action a_4: to y_5.\n\nTo have y_5=0, action S or D, y_5=0.\n\nAt t=5, on y=0, safe.\n\nNow, at t=5, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, we can start moving up.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=5, y=0.\n\nAt t=5, action a_5: U to y=1 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, on y=1.\n\nIs y=1 safe at t=6? Freeway 1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14; t=6 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=7,8,9,10,11 should be safe for y=1 and2, except for t=12,13,14 later.\n\nAt t=6, on y=1, safe.\n\nAction a_5=U, y_6=1? t=5 action to y_6.\n\nt=5: action a_5, to y_6.\n\ny_5=0 at t=5, position during turn t=5.\n\nAction a_5 at t=5 for y_6.\n\nIf a_5=U, y_6=1 at t=6.\n\nOn y=1 at t=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_5=S, y_6=0, or D, y_6=0.\n\nBut to progress, U.\n\ny_6=1 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, action a_6: U to y=2 at t=7.\n\nOn y=2 at t=7: safe, since unsafe only t=3,4,5,12,13,14; t=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_6=U, y_7=3 at t=8.\n\nOn y=3 at t=8: freeway 3 unsafe only t=4,5, so t=8 safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=4 at t=9.\n\nOn y=4 at t=9: freeway 4 unsafe only t=4,5, so t=9 safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=5 at t=10.\n\nOn y=5 at t=10: freeway 5 unsafe only t=2, so t=10 safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=6 at t=11.\n\nOn y=6 at t=11: always safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=7 at t=12.\n\nOn y=7 at t=12: freeway 7 unsafe only t=2, so t=12 safe? t=12, unsafe only at t=2 for y=7, so yes safe.\n\nBut t=12 is when y=1 and2 are unsafe, but y=7 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, a_11=U, y_12=8 at t=13.\n\nOn y=8 at t=13: freeway 8 unsafe only t=2, so safe.\n\na_12=U, y_13=9 at t=14.\n\nOn y=9 at t=14, which is not a freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at t=14.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns? The sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1, and y_H=9.\n\nHere, y_13=9 at t=13? Let's index carefully.\n\nt: turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = new position.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=0 (from a_0=S or D, but we did a_0=S? Let's list actions.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTo have y_4=0 and y_5=0.\n\nStart t=0: y_0=0\n\na_0: let's say S, so y_1=0 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=0\n\na_1: U, so y_2=1 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=1\n\na_2: D, so y_3=0 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=0\n\na_3: S, so y_4=0 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=0\n\na_4: S, so y_5=0 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=0\n\na_5: U, so y_6=1 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=1\n\na_6: U, so y_7=2 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=2\n\na_7: U, so y_8=3 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=3\n\na_8: U, so y_9=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=4\n\na_9: U, so y_10=5 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=5\n\na_10: U, so y_11=6 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=6\n\na_11: U, so y_12=7 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=7\n\na_12: U, so y_13=8 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=8\n\na_13: U, so y_14=9 at t=14\n\nSo y_14=9 at t=14.\n\nThus H=14, with actions from t=0 to t=13.\n\nBut we can reach faster? H=14, but we wasted time at beginning.\n\nSince at t=5, we are at y=0, and from there we go up step by step to y=9 in 9 turns, from t=5 to t=14, but t=5 to t=13 actions, 9 actions, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut we spent 5 turns to stay low.\n\nTotal turns: from t=0 to t=13, 14 turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can start going up earlier after t=5.\n\nIn the above, from t=0 to t=4, we are at y=0, but we could have moved up a bit, but we had to be at y=0 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nAt t=5, we are at y=0.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut at t=12,13,14, y=1 and 2 are unsafe, but in our path, at t=12, we are on y=7, safe; t=13 y=8, safe; t=14 y=9, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at t=5.\n\nBut earlier we saw it's difficult.\n\nSuppose at t=0, we go up to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, stay at y=1 for t=2? But at t=2, on y=1 safe.\n\nThen at t=2, we can go down to y=0 at t=3, but at t=3, on y=0 safe? When we go down to y=0, at t=3, y=0.\n\nThen at t=3, action to y_4.\n\nTo have y_4=0, action S or D.\n\nBut at t=4, on y=0 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, action to y_5, to have y_5=0, action S or D, y_5=0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom t=3, we could go up, but at t=4, if we go up to y=1 at t=5, but at t=5, y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo seems we have to stay at y=0 during t=4 and t=5.\n\nPerhaps at t=5, we can be at y=5 if we can avoid the unsafe at t=4.\n\nBut we can't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, we can go directly to y=6 and stay there during the unsafe times.\n\nBut to reach y=6, we need to go through lower freeways.\n\nFor example, from y=0, to y=6, at least 6 up moves.\n\nBut during the path, we need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFor instance, at t=2, we should not be on y=5 or y=7 or y=8.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are high, not relevant yet.\n\nSuppose we want to reach y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nStart t=0, y=0\n\na_0: U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nsafe\n\na_1: U, to y=2 at t=2\n\nsafe\n\na_2: U, to y=3 at t=3\n\nsafe (y=3 safe at t=3)\n\na_3: U, to y=4 at t=4\n\nbut y=4 unsafe at t=4, crash.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=2, on y=2, instead of U, we go to y=3 at t=3, same as before.\n\nOr at t=1, on y=1, we stay or something.\n\nSuppose at t=0, U to y=1 t=1\n\nThen at t=1, S to y=1 at t=2 (safe)\n\nThen at t=2, U to y=2 at t=3? But at t=3, y=2 unsafe.\n\nCrash.\n\nAt t=2, D to y=1 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps delay the start.\n\nt=0: S, y=0 t=1\n\nt=1: U, y=1 t=2\n\nt=2: S, y=1 t=3? But at t=3, y=1 unsafe.\n\nCrash.\n\nt=2: D to y=0 t=3, safe.\n\nThen t=3: S, y=0 t=4\n\nt=4: S, y=0 t=5\n\nThen from t=5, go up as before.\n\nSame as first plan.\n\nSo minimal H is 14.\n\nBut in the first plan, we used a_0=S, but we could use a_0=D, same y=0.\n\nBut S or D, same effect.\n\nIn the action sequence, it might not matter.\n\nNow, to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have:\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: S (or D) to stay at y=0 for t=1\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=0, and after action, y_1.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=0.\n\nActions a_t for t=0 to H-1.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nIn the plan:\n\nSet a_0: let's say S, so y_1=0\n\na_1: U, y_2=1\n\na_2: D, y_3=0  (since from y=1, D to y=0)\n\na_3: S, y_4=0\n\na_4: S, y_5=0\n\na_5: U, y_6=1\n\na_6: U, y_7=2\n\na_7: U, y_8=3\n\na_8: U, y_9=4\n\na_9: U, y_10=5\n\na_10: U, y_11=6\n\na_11: U, y_12=7\n\na_12: U, y_13=8\n\na_13: U, y_14=9\n\nSo H=14, actions from t=0 to t=13.\n\ny_14=9.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=6 faster and stay, but we have to go through.\n\nAfter t=5, we are at y=0, and we go up every turn.\n\nBut at t=10, y=5, which is safe.\n\nt=11 y=6, etc.\n\nBut we could go faster in the beginning, but we had to wait for t=4 and t=5.\n\nSuppose at t=3, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen instead of staying, we could go up, but at t=4, if we go to y=1, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps during the up phase, we can skip some levels or go faster, but since we can only change by 1, we have to go through each y.\n\nSo I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFreeway 1: cars, car B unsafe at t=3,4,5? Car B: t=3,4,5 for freeway 1.\n\nCar A t=12,13,14.\n\nIn our path, when we go up, at t=6 y=1, which is t=6 not unsafe, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=2, we are on y=1, which is freeway 1, at t=2, safe.\n\nThen we go down to y=0 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=0 safe.\n\nThen stay to t=4, t=5.\n\nThen from t=5 to t=6, to y=1 at t=6, safe.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, we need to specify each action.\n\nIn a_2, we have D, down from y=1 to y=0.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nSince the problem asks for minimal H, and this works.\n\nBut is there H smaller?\n\nSuppose H=9, but from 0 to 9 in 9 turns, must go up every turn, but at t=4, y=4 unsafe, so impossible.\n\nH=10: suppose we go up 9 times in 10 turns, so one stay or down.\n\nBut we need to avoid t=4 on y=4.\n\nFor example, at some point, we stay or go down to delay.\n\nBut at t=4, we must not be on y=4.\n\nSuppose we go slower at start.\n\nt=0: U to y=1 t=1\n\nt=1: S to y=1 t=2  (safe)\n\nt=2: ? If U to y=2 t=3, but y=2 unsafe at t=3.\n\nIf S to y=1 t=3, unsafe.\n\nIf D to y=0 t=3, safe.\n\nThen t=3: on y=0\n\nThen to y_4: if U to y=1 t=4, unsafe.\n\nIf S to y=0 t=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=4: y=0\n\nThen to y_5: if U to y=1 t=5, unsafe at t=5.\n\nIf S to y=0 t=5, safe.\n\nThen we are at y=0 at t=5, same as before, then need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 more turns, so H=14 or more.\n\nIf from t=3 y=0, we go to y=1 at t=4, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo no shorter path.\n\nThus minimal H is 14.\n\nNow for the sequence, we can output.\n\nIn the sequence, we used a_0=S, but we can use a_0=D, same y=0.\n\nBut S might be better, no move.\n\nSimilarly, a_3=S, a_4=S.\n\nIn the output format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 6, it was always safe, but we didn't use it specifically, but in the path we go through y=6.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_0\n\nSince t_1=0.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nWith this, y_14=9.\n\nH=14.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=13.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nAt t=4, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nt=5, y=0, safe.\n\nt=6, y=1, freeway 1, at t=6, no car at 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=7 y=2, freeway 2, t=7 not unsafe time.\n\nt=8 y=3, freeway 3, unsafe only t=4,5, t=8 safe.\n\nt=9 y=4, freeway 4, unsafe only t=4,5, t=9 safe.\n\nt=10 y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only t=2, t=10 safe.\n\nt=11 y=6, safe.\n\nt=12 y=7, freeway 7, unsafe only t=2, t=12 safe.\n\nt=13 y=8, freeway 8, unsafe only t=2, t=13 safe.\n\nt=14 y=9, safe.\n\nAnd we avoided the critical times.\n\nSo it works.\n\nPerhaps we can start with U at t=0, but then we have issues, but we can adjust.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: U to y=1 t=1\n\nt=1: D to y=0 t=2? From y=1, D to y=0.\n\nAt t=1, on y=1, action D, to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, action: to go to y_3.\n\ny_3 must be 0 or 1 for y_4=0.\n\nBut at t=3, y_3 must be safe, so not 1 or 2, so y_3=0.\n\nThus a_2: S or D, to y_3=0.\n\nThen t=3: y=0\n\na_3: S, y_4=0\n\nThen same as before.\n\na_4: S, y_5=0\n\netc.\n\nBut at t=1, we went from y=1 to y=0, but we could have stayed, but we didn't.\n\nIn this case, actions: a_0=U, a_1=D, a_2=S, a_3=S, a_4=S, then a_5=U, etc.\n\nBut we have more actions at beginning, but same H.\n\nIn this, from t=0 to t=4, we have y=0 at t=4 and t=5, same.\n\nBut in this sequence, a_0=U, then a_1=D, so we went up and down, wasted moves.\n\nIn the first sequence, with a_0=S, we have fewer changes.\n\nBut H same.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nNow for output.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=0.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\n}\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 13: U to y=14=9.\n\nAnd we have 14 actions, H=14.\n\nBut in the action list, it's from t=0 to t=13.\n\nTo write properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 14. The sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13\\) ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(H = 14\\) without any collisions.\n\nThe key challenge is avoiding unsafe times on the freeways, particularly at turns \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\), where freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe. To achieve this:\n- The player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway) at turns \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\).\n- From turn \\(t = 5\\) onwards, the player moves upward continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently, as no collisions occur on the path during these turns.\n\nThe action sequence is designed to:\n- Stay at or return to \\(y = 0\\) during critical unsafe turns (e.g., actions at turns 0, 2, 3, 4).\n- Move upward starting from turn 5 to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions and resulting positions are as follows:\n\n| Turn \\(t\\) | Action \\(a_t\\) | Position at Turn \\(t\\) (after action) | Safety Check (at turn \\(t\\)) |\n|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 0          | S              | (0, 0)                                | Safe (not a freeway)        |\n| 1          | U              | (0, 1)                                | Safe: Freeway 1 unsafe only at \\(t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\); \\(t = 1\\) safe. |\n| 2          | D              | (0, 0)                                | Safe (not a freeway)        |\n| 3          | S              | (0, 0)                                | Safe (not a freeway)        |\n| 4          | S              | (0, 0)                                | Safe (not a freeway)        |\n| 5          | U              | (0, 1)                                | Safe: Freeway 1 unsafe only at \\(t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\); \\(t = 6\\) safe. |\n| 6          | U              | (0, 2)                                | Safe: Freeway 2 unsafe only at \\(t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\); \\(t = 7\\) safe. |\n| 7          | U              | (0, 3)                                | Safe: Freeway 3 unsafe only at \\(t = 4, 5\\); \\(t = 8\\) safe. |\n| 8          | U              | (0, 4)                                | Safe: Freeway 4 unsafe only at \\(t = 4, 5\\); \\(t = 9\\) safe. |\n| 9          | U              | (0, 5)                                | Safe: Freeway 5 unsafe only at \\(t = 2\\); \\(t = 10\\) safe. |\n| 10         | U              | (0, 6)                                | Safe: Freeway 6 always safe. |\n| 11         | U              | (0, 7)                                | Safe: Freeway 7 unsafe only at \\(t = 2\\); \\(t = 12\\) safe. |\n| 12         | U              | (0, 8)                                | Safe: Freeway 8 unsafe only at \\(t = 2\\); \\(t = 13\\) safe. |\n| 13         | U              | (0, 9)                                | Safe (not a freeway)        |\n\n- At turn 14, the position is (0, 9), achieving the goal.\n- \\(H = 14\\) is minimal because any shorter sequence would require being on an unsafe freeway at \\(t = 4\\) or \\(t = 5\\), or would not reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns due to the need to avoid collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving on each freeway, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 on that freeway at the same turn. The car positions are given at turn t1=3, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at t1=3:\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\n- Car 1: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 4\n\n- Car 2: head -12, tail -23, direction right, speed 4\n\n- Car 3: head 24, tail 13, direction right, speed 4\n\nSince direction is right, head should be greater than tail, but for the first car, head -48, tail -59, so head is larger because -48 > -59? No: -48 is greater than -59 numerically, but in terms of position, if it's right-moving, head should be the front, so for right-moving cars, head > tail, which is true here: -48 > -59, -12 > -23, 24 > 13.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe span is [tail, head] for right-moving? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, it should be (head, tail) with head > tail, and span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving; I don't see any left-moving cars. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: all right, speed 4\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (-48,-59,right,4), etc., same as freeway 1. Is that a typo or intentional?\n\nFreeway 2 has identical cars to freeway 1? That might be possible.\n\nFreeway 3: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) — all right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? It says (48,37,right,6), etc., same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — speed 12\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (48,37,right,3) — speed 3\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-71,right,24) — speed 24\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nSo freeways 1 and 2 are identical, 3 and 4 identical, 7 and 8 identical, and 5 and 6 different.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nThat is, if y_T = k, and for a car on k, min(span) <= 0 <= max(span) at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action to go to y_{T+1}, but you are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, it doesn't matter because you are not there yet.\n\nOnly the freeway you are currently on matters for collision.\n\nAt each turn, you are on a specific y, and only cars on that y can cause collision if 0 in their span.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9, but y=9 has no cars since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, no cars there. But I need to be at position (0,9), which is x=0, y=9.\n\nx is always 0 for the player, I think, since it's moving vertically? No, the player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, and moving up/down in y.\n\nThe cars are on horizontal freeways, so for each freeway y=k, cars are moving horizontally, and position 0 is the point where player crosses, I assume.\n\nSo collision when player is at (0,k) and a car on freeway k has position 0 occupied at that turn.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should try to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid the cars.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, and y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so only y=1 to 8 matter.\n\nAt turn t1=3, I'm at y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions for turns t=3,4,5,... until I reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSince I need to go up, I should mostly go up, but avoid being on a bad freeway when cars are at 0.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to find when cars are at position 0.\n\nFor a given freeway and car, the time when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince the cars are moving at constant speed, I can find for each car the interval of time when it covers position 0.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need the union of times when any car on that freeway has 0 in span.\n\nThen, for each freeway k, I can find the set of turns T where it is unsafe to be on k.\n\nThen, for the player path, I need that at each turn T, if I am on y_T, it should not be unsafe at that turn.\n\ny_T is the position after action at turn T? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on where I am at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am at y_T, and I check if y_T is between 1 and 8, and if for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at t1=3, so for any future turn T, I can compute the car span at T.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 3.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nFor left-moving, but all are right-moving here, so only right.\n\nSimilarly, head and tail given.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, 0 is in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince span is [min, max], so for right-moving, min = τ + s (T-3), max = h + s (T-3)\n\nThen 0 in span iff τ + s (T-3) <= 0 <= h + s (T-3)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left.\n\nNow, since h > τ for right-moving, as head is larger.\n\nIn the input, for example, freeway 1, car1: h=-48, τ=-59, s=4\n\nSo min = τ + s(T-3) = -59 + 4(T-3)\n\nMax = h + s(T-3) = -48 + 4(T-3)\n\n0 in span if -59 +4(T-3) <= 0 <= -48 +4(T-3)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars:\n\n1. h=-48, τ=-59, s=4\n\n0 in span if: -59 +4(T-3) <= 0 <= -48 +4(T-3)\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -59 +4(T-3) <= 0 => 4(T-3) <= 59 => T-3 <= 59/4 = 14.75, so T-3 <= 14.75\n\nSince T integer, T-3 <= 14? Let's be careful.\n\n-59 +4(Δt) <= 0 => 4Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 14\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +4(Δt) => 48 <= 4Δt => 4Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 12\n\nSo for this car, unsafe when 12 <= Δt <= 14\n\nΔt = T-3, so T from 15 to 17? Let's see:\n\nΔt >=12 and Δt <=14\n\nT-3 >=12 => T >=15\n\nT-3 <=14 => T <=17\n\nSo T=15,16,17\n\nBut we need to check all cars on freeway.\n\nCar2: h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\n0 in span if -23 +4(Δt) <= 0 <= -12 +4(Δt)\n\nLeft: -23 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=23 => Δt <= 23/4 = 5.75, so Δt <=5\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +4Δt => 12 <=4Δt => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=5, so T-3 >=3 => T>=6, T-3<=5 => T<=8, so T=6,7,8\n\nCar3: h=24, τ=13, s=4\n\n0 in span if 13 +4(Δt) <= 0 <= 24 +4(Δt)\n\nLeft: 13 +4Δt <=0? 4Δt <= -13, impossible since Δt >=0, 4Δt >=0, so 13+4Δt >=13>0, so min=13+4Δt >0, so 0 <= min is false, so 0 never <= min since min >0, so 0 not in span for any T.\n\nSimilarly, max=24+4Δt >0, but min >0, so span always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe from car1 at T=15,16,17; car2 at T=6,7,8; car3 never.\n\nSo unsafe when T=6,7,8 or 15,16,17\n\nNow freeway 2 is same as freeway 1, so same unsafe times.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3):\n\nCars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=6\n\nMin = τ + s Δt =37 +6Δt\n\nMax = h + s Δt =48 +6Δt\n\n0 in span? min=37+6Δt >=37>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=12, τ=1, s=6\n\nMin=1+6Δt >=1>0, so never <=0, 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\n0 in span if -35 +6Δt <=0 <= -24 +6Δt\n\nLeft: -35 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so Δt <=5\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +6Δt => 24 <=6Δt => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=5, so T-3>=4 => T>=7, T-3<=5 => T<=8, so T=7,8\n\nNow, other cars on freeway 3 are safe, so unsafe only at T=7,8\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 is same as freeway 3, so unsafe T=7,8\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5):\n\nCars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) all speed 12\n\nFirst car: min=37+12Δt >0, never unsafe\n\nSecond car: min=1+12Δt >0, never unsafe\n\nThird car: min=-35+12Δt, max=-24+12Δt\n\n0 in span if -35+12Δt <=0 <= -24+12Δt\n\nLeft: -35+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+12Δt => 24 <=12Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2.916, since Δt integer, Δt=2\n\nSo T-3=2 => T=5\n\nUnsafe only at T=5\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6):\n\nOnly one car: (48,37,right,3) speed 3\n\nh=48, τ=37\n\nmin=37+3Δt >0, never unsafe, so freeway 6 is always safe.\n\nmin=37+3(Δt) >=37>0, yes, so no car covers 0, so freeway 6 is safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7):\n\nCar: (-48,-71,right,24) speed 24\n\nh=-48, τ=-71? Head and tail.\n\nGiven: head h=-48, tail τ=-71, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nAt T, min = τ + s Δt = -71 + 24 Δt\n\nMax = h + s Δt = -48 + 24 Δt\n\n0 in span if -71 +24 Δt <= 0 <= -48 +24 Δt\n\nLeft: -71 +24 Δt <=0 => 24 Δt <=71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +24 Δt => 48 <=24 Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2.958, so Δt=2\n\nThus T-3=2 => T=5\n\nUnsafe at T=5\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as freeway 7, unsafe at T=5\n\nNow, summarize unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nFor each y from 1 to 8, and for each turn T, is it unsafe.\n\nBut T starts from t1=3, but I can be at earlier or later, but since we start at T=3, and go forward.\n\nAt turn T, unsafe to be on y if for that y, at turn T, 0 is in some car span.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=6,7,8,15,16,17\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe T=6,7,8,15,16,17\n\ny=3: unsafe T=7,8\n\ny=4: unsafe T=7,8\n\ny=5: unsafe T=5\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe T=5\n\ny=8: unsafe T=5\n\ny=5,7,8 all unsafe at T=5? y=5 at T=5, y=7 at T=5, y=8 at T=5.\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=3 to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I reach, I'm done.\n\nThe minimal H might be small if I can go up fast.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, minimum 9 actions, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid, so H>=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might take more.\n\nStart at T=3, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position after H-1 actions: I start at t1, take actions at t=t1 to t1+H-2, and after H-1 actions, at turn t1+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nLet’s say at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nAt T=3, y_3=0\n\nAfter action a_3, at T=4, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\nAnd so on, until at some T, y_T=9.\n\nI need min T such that y_T=9 for some T, and during the path, for each T, if y_T in 1-8, it is safe at that turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, to minimize T, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe positions.\n\nList the unsafe (y,T) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt T=5: y=5,7,8 unsafe\n\nAt T=6: y=1,2 unsafe\n\nAt T=7: y=1,2,3,4 unsafe\n\nAt T=8: y=1,2,3,4 unsafe\n\nAt T=15: y=1,2 unsafe (but T=15 is far, might not be relevant if I can go fast)\n\nFirst, let's see if I can reach y=9 by T=12 or something.\n\nStart at T=3, y=0.\n\nAt T=3, I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at T=4? Action at T determines next y.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo at T=3, y_3=0, I take a_3, then y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y_4, take a_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nNow, at T=3, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI want to go to y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I always go up when possible.\n\nBut need to avoid unsafe spots.\n\nFirst, let's see the unsafe times:\n\nT=5: unsafe on y=5,7,8\n\nT=6: unsafe on y=1,2\n\nT=7: unsafe on y=1,2,3,4\n\nT=8: unsafe on y=1,2,3,4\n\nAfter that, no unsafe until T=15, which is late, so if I can avoid T=5 to T=8, I might be fine.\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\nNow, from y=0 at T=3.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nThe earliest possible: if I go up every turn, y increases by 1 each turn, so from T=3 y=0, after 9 actions, at T=12, y=9? Let's see:\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=3, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: T=4, y=1\n\nAfter 2: T=5, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn T=3+k, y= k\n\nSet y= k at T=3+k\n\nWhen y=9, k=9, T=12\n\nBut at each step, need to be safe.\n\nAt T=4, y=1? T=4, y=1\n\nIs y=1 safe at T=4?\n\nFrom earlier, y=1 unsafe at T=6,7,8,15,17? T=4 not in that list, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=5, y=2: y=2 unsafe at T=6,7,8, etc., T=5 not unsafe for y=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe at same times as y=1: T=6,7,8,15,17\n\nT=5: for y=2, is it unsafe? At T=5, only y=5,7,8 are unsafe, y=2 is safe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, T=6: y=2 is unsafe, since T=6 in unsafe for y=1,2.\n\nLet's list for each T, which y are unsafe.\n\nT=5: unsafe y=5,7,8\n\nT=6: unsafe y=1,2\n\nT=7: unsafe y=1,2,3,4\n\nT=8: unsafe y=1,2,3,4\n\nT=9 and above: only y=1,2 unsafe at T=15,16,17, but T=15 is turn 15, which is later.\n\nFor now, between T=4 to T=12.\n\nT=4: no unsafe y mentioned, so all y safe except possibly, but only y=1-8 have cars, and for T=4, let's verify.\n\nFor example, y=1 at T=4: Δt = T-3 =1\n\nFor freeway 1, car1: at Δt=1, min= -59+4(1)= -55, max= -48+4= -44, both negative, 0 not in span.\n\nCar2: min= -23+4(1)= -19, max= -12+4= -8, both neg, 0 not in.\n\nCar3: min=13+4=17>0, not.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways, for y=1, safe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same.\n\ny=3 at T=4: freeway 3 cars, Δt=1\n\nCar1: min=37+6(1)=43>0\n\nCar2: min=1+6=7>0\n\nCar3: min=-35+6(1)= -29, max=-24+6= -18, both neg, 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, all y safe at T=4.\n\nT=5: unsafe y=5,7,8\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4,6 safe at T=5.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nT=6: unsafe y=1,2; safe y=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=3 and 4 unsafe only at T=7,8, so at T=6 safe.\n\nT=7: unsafe y=1,2,3,4; safe y=5,6,7,8? y=5 safe? At T=7, y=5: freeway 5, cars at Δt= T-3=4\n\nFor freeway 5, car3: unsafe only at Δt=2, T=5, so at T=7, Δt=4, min=-35+12*4= -35+48=13>0, max=-24+48=24>0, so not unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not unsafe, so y=5 safe at T=7.\n\nSimilarly y=6 safe.\n\ny=7: at T=7, freeway 7 car: unsafe only at T=5, so at T=7, Δt=4, min= -71 +24*4= -71+96=25>0, max=-48+96=48>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe.\n\nSo at T=7, unsafe only y=1,2,3,4; safe y=5,6,7,8\n\nSimilarly T=8: same, unsafe y=1,2,3,4; safe y=5,6,7,8\n\nT=9: all safe, since no unsafe times except later.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nIf I go straight up:\n\nStart T=3, y=0, safe.\n\na_3 = U, then T=4, y=1, safe (as above)\n\na_4 = U, T=5, y=2\n\nNow T=5, y=2: is it safe? At T=5, unsafe y=5,7,8, so y=2 is safe, yes.\n\nThen a_5 = U, T=6, y=3\n\nT=6, y=3: unsafe? At T=6, unsafe y=1,2; y=3 is safe, since y=3 unsafe only at T=7,8.\n\nSo y=3 safe at T=6.\n\nThen a_6 = U, T=7, y=4\n\nT=7, y=4: unsafe? At T=7, unsafe y=1,2,3,4, so y=4 unsafe! Cannot be there.\n\nProblem at T=7, if I go up to y=4 at T=7, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or go down, but I need to go up.\n\nAt T=6, y=3, instead of going up, I could stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 earlier.\n\nBut let's see the path so far.\n\nAt T=6, y=3, I need to avoid being on y=4 at T=7 or y=3 at T=7, but y=3 unsafe at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, y=3 and y=4 are both unsafe.\n\nSo at T=7, I cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nI must be on y=5,6,7,8 or 0 or 9.\n\nBut y=0 or 9 possible, but I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly at T=8, same, cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow at T=6, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at T=7, but y=4 unsafe at T=7.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 at T=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at T=7, but y=2 unsafe at T=7.\n\nSo all actions from y=3 at T=6 lead to unsafe at T=7 if I move to y=2,3,4.\n\na_6 action determines y_7.\n\nAt T=6, I am at y_6=3.\n\nI take a_6, which sets y_7.\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6.\n\nIf a_6=U, y_7=4\n\nIf a_6=S, y_7=3\n\nIf a_6=D, y_7=2\n\nAll of these are unsafe at T=7, since y=2,3,4 all unsafe at T=7.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 at T=6; it forces me to be unsafe at T=7.\n\nIn the straight up path, at T=6 I am at y=3, which is bad.\n\nBut at T=5, I was at y=2, which is safe at T=5.\n\nThen I went to y=3 at T=6, which is safe at T=6, but then stuck for T=7.\n\nSo I need to not be at y=3 at T=6.\n\nThat means at T=5, instead of going to y=3, I should do something else.\n\nAt T=5, I am at y=2 (if I went up twice).\n\nT=5, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I can choose action a_5.\n\nIf I go up, y=3 at T=6.\n\nBut then as above, at T=6 y=3, then T=7 I have to be unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, a_5=S, then y=2 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, y=2 is unsafe! Because T=6, y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nSo if I stay at T=5, y=2 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, a_5=D, then y=1 at T=6.\n\nBut y=1 unsafe at T=6.\n\nSo from y=2 at T=5, all actions lead to unsafe at T=6 or set up for T=7.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- U: to y=3 at T=6 (safe at T=6) but then T=7 problem\n\n- S: to y=2 at T=6 (unsafe)\n\n- D: to y=1 at T=6 (unsafe)\n\nSo directly, S and D cause immediate collision at T=6.\n\nU delays to T=7 collision.\n\nBut all bad.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=2 at T=5 in the first place.\n\nNow, back to earlier.\n\nAt T=4, I was at y=1 (if I went up from start).\n\nT=4, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I take a_4.\n\nIf I go up, to y=2 at T=5.\n\nBut as above, at T=5 y=2 is safe, but then leads to problem.\n\nIf I stay, a_4=S, then y=1 at T=5.\n\nIs y=1 safe at T=5?\n\nT=5, unsafe y=5,7,8, so y=1 should be safe.\n\nYes.\n\nThen at T=5, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, I take a_5.\n\nIf I go up, to y=2 at T=6, but T=6 y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf stay, y=1 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf down, to y=0 at T=6, which is safe, but I go down, not good.\n\nIf I go down to y=0, safe, but I need to go up.\n\nBut from y=0 at T=6, I can go up later.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps I need to be at a different position at critical times.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 and stay there during bad times, but I need to reach there.\n\nNow, the critical turns are T=5,6,7,8.\n\nSpecifically, T=7 and T=8, I need to be on y=5,6,7,8 which are safe.\n\nT=6, I need to be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 safe, but avoid y=1,2.\n\nT=5, I need to be on y=1,2,3,4,6 safe, avoid y=5,7,8.\n\nNow, I start at T=3, y=0.\n\nI need to get to high y by T=7.\n\nMinimal path: from y=0 to y=9, min 9 steps, but with constraints.\n\nSince at T=7 and T=8, I must be on y>=5, because y=5,6,7,8 safe, y=1-4 unsafe.\n\nAt T=6, I can be on y=3 to 8, but y=1,2 unsafe.\n\nAt T=5, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,4,6, but not 5,7,8.\n\ny=0 and 6 are safe.\n\nNow, let's plan the path turn by turn.\n\nT=3, y=0, must take action a_3.\n\nOptions: U, S, D.\n\nIf D, y=0 -1 = -1, but y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y in [0,9], so I cannot go below 0 or above 9. If I try to go down at y=0, it should stay 0? The game dynamics say y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, probably y_{t+1}=0, similarly for up at 9.\n\nI think it's clamped, but not specified. The equation says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, but with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if it goes out, it should be clamped.\n\nBut to be safe, assume that if I try to go down at 0, y stays 0.\n\nSimilarly up at 9 stays 9.\n\nBut in this case, at y=0, D and S both keep y=0, U goes to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, to save time, I should go up.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAssume that actions at boundaries are handled by clamping.\n\nSo at y=0, D and S: y next =0, U: y=1.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U and S: y=9, D: y=8.\n\nNow, back.\n\nT=3, y=0.\n\nI take a_3.\n\nIf a_3 = U, then T=4, y=1\n\nIf a_3 = S or D, T=4, y=0\n\nBut staying at y=0 doesn't help, I need to go up, so probably U is better.\n\nSo a_3 = U, T=4, y=1\n\nNow T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nTake a_4.\n\nOptions: U, S, D.\n\nIf U, T=5, y=2\n\nIf S, T=5, y=1\n\nIf D, T=5, y=0\n\nNow, at T=5, y=2,1,0 all safe, as established.\n\nBut if I go to y=2 at T=5, then as before, stuck for next.\n\nIf I go to y=1 or y=0 at T=5.\n\nSay a_4 = S, so T=5, y=1\n\nThen at T=5, y=1, safe.\n\nNow take a_5.\n\nIf U, to y=2 at T=6, but T=6 y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf S, to y=1 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf D, to y=0 at T=6, safe.\n\nSo only safe choice is D, to y=0 at T=6.\n\nBut then I am back at y=0 at T=6.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up, but it's late.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=4 I go down to y=0, worse.\n\nSo better to go to y=1 at T=5.\n\nBut then I have to go down to y=0 at T=6 to avoid unsafe.\n\nAt T=6, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=6, I can go up to y=1 at T=7.\n\nBut T=7, y=1 unsafe! Because y=1 unsafe at T=7.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at T=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=0 at T=7, safe, but not progress.\n\nIf down, y=0.\n\nSo stuck at bottom.\n\nNot good.\n\nTherefore, I need to be at a higher y before T=5.\n\nAt T=4, instead of staying, I should go up to y=2 at T=5.\n\nBut then from y=2 at T=5, I need to handle T=6 and T=7.\n\nAt T=5, y=2, I can take action.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at T=6.\n\nT=6, y=3 is safe (since only y=1,2 unsafe at T=6).\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, I need to take a_6 for T=7.\n\nBut at T=7, if I go up to y=4, unsafe; stay y=3 unsafe; down y=2 unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nUnless I can jump to y=5 or higher, but I can only change by 1, so from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at T=7, all unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=3 at T=6.\n\nTherefore, I must not be at y=3 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=5, if I am at y=2, I cannot go to y=3 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=5, y=2, if I don't go up, I go to y=1 or 0 at T=6, which are unsafe at T=6.\n\nSo from y=2 at T=5, no safe action for T=6 except to unsafe y, or to y=3 which leads to T=7 unsafe.\n\nSo I must avoid being at y=2 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, if I go to y=2 at T=5, it's problematic.\n\nSo at T=4, I should not go up, but stay or down.\n\nBut if at T=4, I stay at y=1, then to y=1 at T=5, safe, but then at T=5, I have to go down to y=0 at T=6 to avoid unsafe, then at T=6 y=0, and T=7 I can go to y=1 but unsafe, or stay.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf at T=4 I go down to y=0 at T=5, then at T=5 y=0, safe, then at T=5 I can go up to y=1 at T=6, but T=6 y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr stay y=0.\n\nSo I need to be at y=4 or higher by T=6 or something.\n\nLet's think about where to be at each turn.\n\nAt T=7 and T=8, I must be on y=5,6,7, or 8.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 safe at T=7 and T=8.\n\nAt T=6, I can be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8, but not 1,2.\n\nAt T=5, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,4,6, but not 5,7,8.\n\ny=6 is safe at T=5.\n\nI start at T=3, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=5+ by T=7.\n\nMin turns: from T=3 to T=7, 4 turns, I can increase y by at most 4, from 0 to 4, but at T=7, I need y>=5, so y=4 at T=7 is not enough, since y=4 unsafe at T=7.\n\nSo I must be at y>=5 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly at T=8, y>=5.\n\nNow, from T=3 to T=7, 4 actions: a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 determining y_7.\n\ny_7 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 + Δy_6\n\ny_3=0, so y_7 = sum of Δy from t=3 to 6.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_7 <= 4.\n\nBut y_7 must be >=5, impossible.\n\ny_7 <= 4, but need >=5, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y>=5 at T=7 starting from y=0 at T=3 with only 4 actions.\n\nActions: at T=3, a_3 affects y_4.\n\na_4 affects y_5.\n\na_5 affects y_6.\n\na_6 affects y_7.\n\nSo with 4 actions, from y_3 to y_7, max increase 4, so y_7 <=4.\n\nBut at T=7, y must be >=5 to be safe, so y_7 <=4 <5, so I must be on y<=4 at T=7, but all y<=4 are unsafe at T=7 except y=0, but y=0 is not in 1-8, so for y=0, no collision, but at T=7, if I am on y=0, it is safe, but y=0 is not a freeway with cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at T=7, if I am on y=0, safe, but I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut from y=0 at T=7, I can go up later.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, if on y=0, safe.\n\nBut I can be on higher y.\n\nThe point is, at T=7, if I am on y=0,1,2,3,4, but y=1,2,3,4 unsafe, only y=0 safe or y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=8.\n\nSo it is possible to be at y=0 at T=7.\n\nThen from there, I can go up after T=8.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nT=3: y=0\n\nT=4: after a_3\n\nT=5: after a_4\n\nT=6: after a_5\n\nT=7: after a_6\n\nT=8: after a_7\n\netc.\n\nAt T=6, I need to not be on y=1 or 2, so y_6 must be in {0,3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\nAt T=5, I need to not be on y=5,7,8, so y_5 in {0,1,2,3,4,6}\n\nAt T=4, no restriction, all y safe.\n\nNow, from start.\n\nT=3, y=0, take a_3.\n\nIf a_3=U, T=4 y=1\n\nIf a_3=S or D, T=4 y=0\n\nTo make progress, U better.\n\nSo a_3=U, T=4 y=1\n\nNow T=4, y=1, take a_4.\n\nI want to be at y=6 at some point, since always safe.\n\nBut at T=5, y=6 is safe.\n\nSo perhaps go to y=6 quickly.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=4, to go to y=6, I need at least 5 steps, but only 1 action so far, y=1, to y=6 min 5 more actions, so at T=9 or later.\n\nBut I can do it in fewer by going faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=4, after k actions, y <= 1+k.\n\nFor example, to reach y=6, min at T=9 if go up each turn.\n\nT=4 y=1, a_4=U, T=5 y=2, a_5=U, T=6 y=3, a_6=U, T=7 y=4, but at T=7 y=4 unsafe, so not.\n\nI need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSince at T=7 and T=8, I can be on y=0 or y=5-8.\n\nBut y=5-8 may not be reachable early.\n\nSo perhaps be at y=0 at T=7 and T=8, then after that go up.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nSo plan: be at y=0 at T=6, T=7, T=8? But at T=6, y=0 is safe, but I can be higher.\n\nAt T=6, I can be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 safe.\n\nBut let's see how to get there.\n\nStart T=3 y=0.\n\na_3 = U, T=4 y=1\n\nNow at T=4, I need to set y_5.\n\ny_5 must be in {0,1,2,3,4,6} for T=5 safe.\n\nIf I go up, y_5=2\n\nIf stay, y_5=1\n\nIf down, y_5=0\n\nAll possible.\n\nBut if y_5=2, then at T=5, y=2, then for T=6, y_6 must be in {0,3,4,5,6,7,8}, not 1 or 2.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=5, to go to y=0,3,4,etc.\n\nIf I go down, to y=1 at T=6, but y=1 not in safe for T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go up, to y=3 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, safe.\n\nThen for T=7, I need to be on safe y, which are y=0,5,6,7,8 (since y=1,2,3,4 unsafe at T=7)\n\nFrom y=3, I can go to y=2,3,4 at T=7, all unsafe, or to y=0? From y=3, down to y=2, not 0 directly; one step down to y=2.\n\nFrom y=3, a_6=D, y_7=2; S y_7=3; U y_7=4; all unsafe at T=7.\n\nCannot go to y=5 from y=3 in one step.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=3 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=5 I am at y=1.\n\nT=5 y=1, safe.\n\nThen for T=6, y_6 must be in safe for T=6, which is {0,3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\nFrom y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 is in safe, y=1 and 2 not.\n\nSo only choice is go down to y=0 at T=6.\n\na_5=D, T=6 y=0\n\nThen at T=6, y=0, safe.\n\nNow for T=7, I need to be on safe y for T=7: y=0,5,6,7,8\n\nFrom y=0, I can go to y=0 or 1.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 is unsafe at T=7.\n\nSo I can stay at y=0 or go down to y=0, so a_6=S or D, T=7 y=0\n\nThen at T=7, y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=8, same, I can stay at y=0, safe.\n\nBut then after T=8, I can start going up.\n\nT=8, y=0, take a_7=U, T=9 y=1\n\nT=9 y=1, safe, since no unsafe at T=9.\n\na_8=U, T=10 y=2\n\nT=10 y=2, safe.\n\na_9=U, T=11 y=3\n\nT=11 y=3, safe.\n\na_10=U, T=12 y=4\n\nT=12 y=4, safe.\n\na_11=U, T=13 y=5\n\nT=13 y=5, safe.\n\na_12=U, T=14 y=6\n\nT=14 y=6, safe.\n\na_13=U, T=15 y=7\n\nNow T=15, y=7: is it safe? Freeway 7, at T=15, Δt=12, min= -71 +24*12 = -71 + 288 = 217>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_14=U, T=16 y=8\n\nT=16 y=8: freeway 8, same, min= -71 +24*13? T=16, Δt=T-3=13, min= -71 +24*13= -71+312=241>0, safe.\n\nBut at T=16, for y=1 and 2, are they unsafe? T=15,16,17 y=1 and 2 unsafe, but I am on y=8, so fine.\n\nThen a_15=U, T=17 y=9, reached.\n\nBut this is many turns, from T=3 to T=17, 14 turns? Let's count.\n\nAt T=3, start y=0.\n\nAfter actions: we have actions from t=3 to t=16, 14 actions? To reach at turn after H-1 actions.\n\nDefine H as number of actions.\n\nStart at turn T=3, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T=3+H, y should be 9.\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=3, y=0\n\na_3: let's list actions.\n\nIn the above:\n\nT=3: y=0\n\na_3 = U, T=4 y=1\n\na_4 = ? In the path I described, from T=4 y=1, I went to T=5 y=1? No.\n\nIn the safe path I started: a_3=U, T=4 y=1\n\nThen at T=4, I took a_4, but in the earlier part, to avoid, I went down or something.\n\nIn the path where I stayed at bottom:\n\nFrom T=4 y=1, I need to get to y=0 at T=6.\n\nSo at T=4 y=1, I can take a_4 to set y_5.\n\nIf I go down, a_4=D, T=5 y=0\n\nThen at T=5 y=0, safe.\n\nThen a_5=D or S, to keep y=0 at T=6? a_5 action for y_6.\n\nFrom y=0, a_5=D or S, y_6=0\n\nThen T=6 y=0\n\na_6=S or D, T=7 y=0\n\na_7=S or D, T=8 y=0\n\nThen a_8=U, T=9 y=1\n\na_9=U, T=10 y=2\n\na_10=U, T=11 y=3\n\na_11=U, T=12 y=4\n\na_12=U, T=13 y=5\n\na_13=U, T=14 y=6\n\na_14=U, T=15 y=7\n\na_15=U, T=16 y=8\n\na_16=U, T=17 y=9\n\nSo at T=17, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_3 to a_16, 14 actions? Actions at t=3 to t=16, that's 14 actions, but H is the number, so after H actions, at turn 3+H.\n\nAfter 0 actions, T=3\n\nAfter 1 action, T=4\n\n...\nAfter k actions, T=3+k\n\nSet y=9 at T=3+H, so H=14.\n\nBut this is long, and I can do better by going to y=6 during the safe period.\n\nFor example, at T=5, y=6 is safe.\n\nSo if I can be at y=6 at T=5, then I can stay or go up during T=6,7,8.\n\nBut from start, T=3 y=0 to T=5 y=6, in 2 actions, max increase 2, to y=2, not 6.\n\nImpossible.\n\nT=3 to T=5, actions a_3 and a_4 affect y_5.\n\ny_5 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 = 0 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 <= 0+1+1=2, so y_5 <=2, cannot be 6.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at T=6: from T=3 to T=6, 3 actions, y_6 <=3, not 6.\n\nAt T=7, y_7 <=4, not 6.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=6 is T=9, with 6 up actions.\n\nBut at T=7 and T=8, I can be at y=6 if I can reach it.\n\nBut from above, at T=7, y_7 <=4, so I cannot be at y=6 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y_8 = y_3 + sum Δy from t=3 to7, 5 actions, max y_8=5.\n\nStill less than 6.\n\ny_8 <=5.\n\nAt T=9, y_9 <=6.\n\nCan be 6.\n\nBut at T=9, all safe, so possible.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach faster.\n\nAnother idea: at T=5, I can be at y=6? No, impossible.\n\nOr at T=6, y=6, but y_6 <=3, not 6.\n\nSo I cannot be at high y early.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at low y during T=6,7,8, like y=0, and then go up after.\n\nBut in the path above, I reached at T=17 with 14 actions.\n\nBut I can start going up earlier after T=8.\n\nIn the path, I stayed at y=0 until T=8.\n\nBut at T=6, I can be at higher safe y, like y=3,4,5,6,7,8, but I need to reach there.\n\nFor example, at T=6, I can be at y=3 or 4.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom start.\n\nT=3 y=0, a_3=U, T=4 y=1\n\nNow at T=4 y=1, take a_4.\n\nI want y_5 in {0,1,2,3,4,6}\n\nBut y=6 not reachable, so y_5 <=2.\n\nSo y_5=0,1,2.\n\nSay I go to y_5=2, a_4=U.\n\nT=5 y=2, safe.\n\nThen for T=6, y_6 must be in {0,3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\nFrom y=2, I can go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=1 and 2 not in safe for T=6, so only possible if I can go to y=3.\n\na_5=U, T=6 y=3.\n\nT=6 y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=6 y=3, for T=7, I need y_7 in {0,5,6,7,8}\n\nBut from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4, all not in the set, and unsafe.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nIf at T=5 I am at y=1.\n\nT=4 y=1, a_4=S, T=5 y=1\n\nThen a_5=D, T=6 y=0, as before.\n\nOr if at T=4 I go down, a_4=D, T=5 y=0\n\nThen at T=5 y=0, I can take a_5=U, to T=6 y=1, but T=6 y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr a_5=S, T=6 y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo no way to be at high y at T=6.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at y=0 at T=6, T=7, T=8, then go up.\n\nBut at T=6, I can be at y=0, which is fine.\n\nThen from T=8 y=0, I go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I can go up during the safe periods before.\n\nFor example, at T=4 and T=5, I can be at y=1 or 2.\n\nIn the path, I was at y=1 at T=4, then down to y=0 at T=5 or something.\n\nLet's list a minimal path.\n\nStart T=3 y=0.\n\na_3 = U (go up), T=4 y=1\n\nNow at T=4 y=1, to avoid problem at T=6, I should not be at y=1 or 2 at T=6.\n\nSo at T=4, I can stay or go down.\n\nIf a_4 = S, T=5 y=1\n\nThen at T=5 y=1, I must go down to y=0 at T=6 to avoid unsafe, so a_5 = D, T=6 y=0\n\nThen at T=6 y=0, for T=7, I can stay or go down, but to avoid y=1, I should not go up, so a_6 = S or D, T=7 y=0\n\nSimilarly, at T=7 y=0, a_7 = S or D, T=8 y=0\n\nThen at T=8 y=0, a_8 = U, T=9 y=1\n\na_9 = U, T=10 y=2\n\na_10 = U, T=11 y=3\n\na_11 = U, T=12 y=4\n\na_12 = U, T=13 y=5\n\na_13 = U, T=14 y=6\n\na_14 = U, T=15 y=7\n\na_15 = U, T=16 y=8\n\na_16 = U, T=17 y=9\n\nH=14 actions, reach at T=17.\n\nBut I can go up at T=4 to y=2, but then I have to go down later, but it might not save time.\n\na_3=U, T=4 y=1\n\na_4=U, T=5 y=2\n\nThen at T=5 y=2, I have to go down or something, but to avoid T=6 unsafe, I need to go to y=0 or 3, but from y=2, to y=3 is possible, but then T=7 problem.\n\nIf at T=5 y=2, I go down to y=1, but T=6 y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr to y=0, a_5=D, T=6 y=1? From y=2, D to y=1 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down twice, but from T=5 y=2, a_5=D, to T=6 y=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=2 at T=5 if I want to avoid T=6 collision.\n\nTherefore, the only safe choices are to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=5, and from there go to y=0 at T=6.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=4 at T=6.\n\nHow? From start, T=3 y=0, a_3=U, T=4 y=1, a_4=U, T=5 y=2, then a_5=U, T=6 y=3.\n\nT=6 y=3 safe.\n\nBut then T=7 I cannot escape.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14 with the path above.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter way.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=4 at T=7, but T=7 y=4 unsafe, cannot.\n\nOr at T=8, y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at T=7 and T=8.\n\nThen from T=8 y=0, it takes 9 actions to go to y=9, at T=17.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=16 for 9 steps.\n\nT=8 y=0, a_8=U, T=9 y=1, ..., a_16=U, T=17 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=3 to t=16 is 14.\n\nBut at the beginning, from T=3 to T=8, I have 5 actions: a_3 to a_7, with y from 0 to 0, so I can use some actions to go up before T=6.\n\nFor example, at T=3, a_3=U, T=4 y=1\n\nThen at T=4, instead of staying, I go up, a_4=U, T=5 y=2\n\nBut at T=5 y=2, I cannot stay or go up because of T=6, so I must go down to y=1 or 0, but at T=6, if I go to y=1, unsafe; to y=0, safe but late.\n\na_5=D, from y=2 to y=1 at T=6, but T=6 y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo if I am at y=2 at T=5, the only way to avoid collision at T=6 is to go to y=3, but then T=7 collision.\n\nSo I must not be at y=2 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, if I am at y=1, I should not go up to y=2 at T=5.\n\nSo at T=4, from y=1, I should stay or go down.\n\nIf I go down to y=0 at T=5, then at T=5 y=0, I can go up to y=1 at T=6, but unsafe, or stay y=0.\n\nSo to avoid, I stay at y=0 or down.\n\nSo the path I have is indeed the only safe way, with H=14.\n\nBut let's check if I can reach y=9 faster by going to y=6 after T=8.\n\nFor example, from T=8 y=0, I go up each turn, reach y=9 at T=17.\n\nBut if I can be at higher y at T=8, but at T=8, I am at y=0, so y=0.\n\nAt T=7, I am at y=0, etc.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps during T=4 or T=5, I can be at y=6, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=14 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=3.\n\nActions for turn t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn my case, at T=17, y=9, t1=3, so 3 + H =17, H=14.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=16.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: ? In my path, at turn 4, I took a_4, but in the safe path, I had options.\n\nIn the first part, to get to y=0 at T=6.\n\nFrom T=3: a_3=U, to y=1 at T=4\n\nThen at T=4, I need to set for T=5.\n\nIf I take a_4=S, to y=1 at T=5\n\nThen a_5=D, to y=0 at T=6\n\nThen a_6=S, to y=0 at T=7\n\na_7=S, to y=0 at T=8\n\na_8=U, to y=1 at T=9\n\na_9=U, to y=2 at T=10\n\na_10=U, to y=3 at T=11\n\na_11=U, to y=4 at T=12\n\na_12=U, to y=5 at T=13\n\na_13=U, to y=6 at T=14\n\na_14=U, to y=7 at T=15\n\na_15=U, to y=8 at T=16\n\na_16=U, to y=9 at T=17\n\nIn this, at T=4, I took S, but I could take D to go to y=0 earlier.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nTo save one action, but I don't think so.\n\nSince at T=5, if I am at y=0, I can stay, but in this path, at T=5 I am at y=1, then go down.\n\nIf at T=4, I go down to y=0.\n\nT=3 y=0, a_3=U, T=4 y=1\n\na_4=D, T=5 y=0\n\nThen at T=5 y=0, I can take a_5=S or D, to y=0 at T=6\n\nThen same as above.\n\nOr a_5=U, to y=1 at T=6, but unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo must stay or down.\n\nSo same number of actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=14.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by being at y=6 at T=9.\n\nFor example, from T=8 y=0, a_8=U, T=9 y=1\n\nBut to be at y=6 at T=9, I need to increase faster, but I can only do one per turn, so from y=0 at T=8, to y=6 at T=9 impossible.\n\nEarliest y=6 at T=9 with a_8=U to y=1 T=9? T=8 y=0, a_8=U, T=9 y=1\n\nThen to y=6 at T=14, as above.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think 14 is the best.\n\nBut in the beginning, I have to waste turns at bottom.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, always safe, so if I can be on y=6 during the bad times.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at T=7, I need y_7=6, but from start, max y_7=4, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow for the answer, the sequence of actions.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=16.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (in my first path, I had a_4=S to stay at y=1 for T=5, but I could have gone down, but S is fine)\n\nIn the sequence above, I have:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (to stay at y=1 for T=5)\n\nTurn 5: D  (to go to y=0 at T=6)\n\nTurn 6: S  (stay y=0 at T=7)\n\nTurn 7: S  (stay y=0 at T=8)\n\nTurn 8: U  (to y=1 at T=9)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y=2 T=10)\n\nTurn 10: U  (y=3 T=11)\n\nTurn 11: U  (y=4 T=12)\n\nTurn 12: U  (y=5 T=13)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y=6 T=14)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y=7 T=15)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y=8 T=16)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y=9 T=17)\n\nH=14 actions.\n\nBut at turn 4, I could do D instead of S, but then:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: D  (to y=0 at T=5)\n\nThen at T=5 y=0, I must take Turn 5: S or D, say S, to y=0 at T=6\n\nThen same as before, Turn 6: S, etc.\n\nBut then at Turn 4: D, which is down, but I was at y=1, down to y=0, so action D.\n\nBut in terms of number, same.\n\nIn the sequence, I have to list for each turn.\n\nIn the first sequence, Turn 4 is S, which is stay, but at y=1, staying is fine.\n\nTo make it consistent, I can use the first one.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nIt says: Turn t1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nt1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAnd after Turn 16, at Turn 17, y=9.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose at some point I go up faster after T=8.\n\nFor example, from T=8 y=0, I go up every turn, 9 actions to y=9 at T=17.\n\nBut if I could be at y=1 at T=8, then I can save one action.\n\nBut at T=8, how to be at y=1.\n\nFrom T=7, if I am at y=1, but at T=7 y=1 unsafe, so I cannot be at y=1 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo at T=7 and T=8, I must be at y=0 or y>=5, but y>=5 not reachable, so y=0.\n\nThus, at T=8, y=0, so I have to start from there.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=14.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow to write in the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 3 to 16, 14 turns.\n\nThe actions are for turn t, a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter turn 16, at turn 17, position (0,9), reached.\n\nAnd during the path, all safe: at T=4 y=1 safe, T=5 y=1 safe, T=6 y=0 safe, T=7 y=0 safe, T=8 y=0 safe, T=9 y=1 safe, and so on, no collisions.\n\nAt T=15 y=7, as I computed, safe, etc.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 14. This means the sequence of actions starts at turn 3 and ends at turn 16, with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 17.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid all unsafe positions during critical turns, particularly from turn 5 to turn 8, where multiple freeways are unsafe due to car positions. The player stays at \\(y = 0\\) during turns 6, 7, and 8 to avoid collisions, as \\(y = 0\\) is always safe (no cars). After turn 8, the player moves up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4.\n- **Turn 4**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 5 (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is not unsafe at turn 5).\n- **Turn 5**: Move down (D) to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 6 (to avoid being on \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at turn 6, which are unsafe).\n- **Turn 6**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 7 (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars).\n- **Turn 7**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 8 (safe, same reason).\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13.\n- **Turn 13**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14.\n- **Turn 14**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15.\n- **Turn 15**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16.\n- **Turn 16**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Safety**: At each turn from 3 to 16, the player's position is safe:\n  - Turns 3, 6, 7, 8: At \\(y = 0\\) (always safe).\n  - Turn 4: At \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as no cars cover position 0 at turn 4).\n  - Turn 5: At \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as unsafe freeways at turn 5 are \\(y = 5, 7, 8\\)).\n  - Turns 9 to 16: Moving up through \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\); all are safe at these turns because:\n    - Turns 9-14: No unsafe conditions for any freeway (unsafe times occur only at turns 5-8 and 15-17 for specific freeways, but the player is not on affected freeways).\n    - Turn 15: At \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as car on freeway 7 covers position 0 only at turn 5; at turn 15, min span = \\(-71 + 24 \\times 12 = 217 > 0\\)).\n    - Turn 16: At \\(y = 8\\) (safe, similarly; car on freeway 8 covers position 0 only at turn 5).\n- **Efficiency**: \\(H = 14\\) is minimal because:\n  - During turns 7 and 8, the player must be on \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y \\geq 5\\) to avoid unsafe positions (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(4\\) are unsafe), but reaching \\(y \\geq 5\\) by turn 7 or 8 is impossible from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 3 with the movement constraints (maximum \\(y\\) increase is 1 per turn, so \\(y_7 \\leq 4\\) and \\(y_8 \\leq 5\\)).\n  - Being at \\(y = 0\\) during turns 6-8 is the only safe option, and reaching \\(y = 9\\) from there requires 9 actions (turns 8 to 16), leading to \\(H = 14\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nThe cars are moving, and I collide only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on my current y at each turn.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars will be at future turns. The car positions are given at turn t_1=5, and for future turns T, the span changes based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me denote the turn difference as Δt = T - t_1 = T - 5.\n\nFor each car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s * (T - t_1), τ - s * (T - t_1)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be decreasing, so [h, τ] with h > τ? No, typically head and tail, but in the span, it might not be sorted.\n\nLook at the values: for example, freeway 1: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nIt says head h and tail τ. For right-moving, span is [τ, h], and for left-moving, [h, τ]? But in this case, all directions are right, I think.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nNow, for right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nBut in this data, all cars seem to be right-moving, since direction is \"right\".\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: all right\n\nFreeway 2: all right\n\nFreeway 3: all right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: all right\n\nFreeway 6: right\n\nFreeway 7: right\n\nFreeway 8: right\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars.\n\nSo for all, since right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and Span(T) = [τ + s * (T-5), h + s * (T-5)]\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nIn the car list, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nSince right-moving, at t_1=5, span is [τ, h] = [-51, -40]\n\nSimilarly, (-4, -15, right, 4): [ -15, -4 ]\n\n(32, 21, right, 4): [21, 32]? But 21 to 32, that's increasing, but τ=21, h=32, so [τ, h] = [21,32], which is fine.\n\nτ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T), meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nNow, at each turn T, I need to check for each freeway I might be on, whether there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nBut I start at y=1 at turn 5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken at each turn, so at turn t, I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 5, I am at position (0, y_5) = (0,1)\n\nAfter action a_5, at turn 6, I move to y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, after action a_t, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on where I am at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T)\n\nThen, if y_T is between 1 and 8, I am on a freeway, and I collide if there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nIf y_T is 0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, as per the problem.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I have to end at y=9, and it's safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9, so I need to move up at least 8 times, but I can also move down or stay, but since I want minimal turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid collisions, so I might need to wait or something.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of turns to reach, so I should minimize the number of actions.\n\nEach action changes the turn, so from turn 5, after H actions, I am at turn 5+H, and y_{5+H} should be 9.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions at turns 5 to 5+H-1, and I am at y_{5+H}.\n\nSet t=0 at the start.\n\nCurrent turn is 5, I am at y=1.\n\nI take action a_5 at turn 5, which determines y_6.\n\nThen action a_6 at turn 6, determines y_7, and so on, up to action a_{5+H-1} at turn 5+H-1, which determines y_{5+H}, and I want y_{5+H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so turns 5 to 5+H-1.\n\nAnd after that, at turn 5+H, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, for collision: at each turn T, from T=5 to T=5+H-1, I am at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, I must not have a car on that freeway with 0 in span at T.\n\nAt turn 5+H, I am at y=9, which is safe, so no collision check needed, I think.\n\nThe collision is only when on freeway, so at y=9, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 5, I am at y=1, so I need to check for collision at turn 5 on freeway 1.\n\nBut at turn 5, the car positions are given, so I can check if I collide at start.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their spans at turn 5, since t_1=5.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\nFirst car: h=-40, τ=-51, right, s=4 → span at t=5: [τ, h] = [-51, -40]\n\n0 is not in [-51,-40], since -40 < 0? -40 < 0, so 0 > -40, not <=, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-4, τ=-15, s=4 → span [-15, -4], both negative, -4 < 0, so 0 not in [-15,-4].\n\nThird car: h=32, τ=21, s=4 → span [21,32], both positive, 21>0, so 0 not in [21,32].\n\nSo on freeway 1 at turn 5, no car has 0 in span, so I am safe at turn 5.\n\nNow, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 2: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4) — same as freeway 1.\n\nIn the table, freeway 1 and 2 have identical cars.\n\nFreeway 3: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nAt t=5: first car: [49,60]? τ=49, h=60, so [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond: τ=13, h=24, [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nThird: τ=-23, h=-12, [-23,-12], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) — identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nτ and h: for first car, h=-48, τ=-59, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: h=36, τ=25, [25,36], positive.\n\nThird car: h=0, τ=-11, so span [-11, 0]\n\nNow, 0 is in [-11,0]? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSo on freeway 5, at turn 5, there is a car with span [-11,0], so 0 is in it.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 5 at turn 5, I am on freeway 1, so no problem.\n\nBut later, if I go to freeway 5, I need to be careful.\n\nFreeway 6: (54,43,right,3) — only one car? h=54, τ=43, span [43,54], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 7: (0,-23,right,24) — h=0, τ=-23, span [-23,0], so 0 is in [-23,0].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same, (0,-23,right,24), span [-23,0], 0 in it.\n\nBut again, not relevant now.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and for future turns, when 0 is covered by a car, so that I cannot be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince I need to go through y=2 to y=8, I must be on each at some point, but I can skip some or stay, but I have to reach y=9.\n\nI can move vertically, so I need to be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at different turns, but I might stay on one for multiple turns or move quickly.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I want to move up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when 0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, for each freeway k, and for each turn T, I need to know if at turn T, there is a car on k with 0 in span.\n\nIf yes, then I cannot be on freeway k at turn T.\n\nOtherwise, it is safe to be on k at T.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the times when 0 is covered might be intervals.\n\nFor each car, I can find the time interval when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for a freeway, if any car has 0 in span at T, then unsafe.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nFirst, for a right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)]\n\n0 is in this span if:\n\nτ + s*(T-5) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-5)\n\nSince the car is moving right, τ + s*(T-5) is the left end, increasing, h + s*(T-5) is right end, increasing.\n\nSo 0 is in [left, right] when left <= 0 and right >= 0? No.\n\nleft <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo:\n\nτ + s*(T-5) <= 0  and  0 <= h + s*(T-5)\n\nWhich is:\n\nτ + s*(T-5) <= 0  => s*(T-5) <= -τ  => T-5 <= -τ / s\n\nAnd 0 <= h + s*(T-5) => s*(T-5) >= -h => T-5 >= -h / s\n\nSo T-5 >= ceil( -h / s ) ? Since T integer, we need to find integer T.\n\nSimilarly for the inequality.\n\nLet Δt = T - 5\n\nThen 0 in span if:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0  and  0 <= h + s Δt\n\nSo:\n\ns Δt <= -τ  => Δt <= floor( -τ / s ) ? Let's be careful with inequalities.\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0  => s Δt <= -τ\n\nSince s >0, Δt <= floor( -τ / s ) if -τ/s not integer, but since inequality, better to solve.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s Δt => s Δt >= -h => Δt >= ceil( -h / s )\n\nAnd from τ + s Δt <= 0 => s Δt <= -τ => Δt <= floor( -τ / s ) if we think in integers.\n\nLet me define for each car, the values.\n\nFirst, for a car, let L = τ, R = h for right-moving.\n\nThen at Δt, span [L + s Δt, R + s Δt]\n\n0 in span iff L + s Δt <= 0 <= R + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nL + s Δt <= 0  and  R + s Δt >= 0\n\nSo:\n\ns Δt <= -L  => Δt <= floor( (-L) / s )   ? Not necessarily.\n\nFor example, if s Δt <= -L, since Δt integer, Δt <= floor( -L / s )\n\nSimilarly, s Δt >= -R  => Δt >= ceil( -R / s )\n\nBecause s Δt >= -R, so Δt >= ceil( -R / s )\n\nSimilarly, s Δt <= -L, so Δt <= floor( -L / s )\n\nThen the interval for Δt is from ceil( -R / s ) to floor( -L / s ) inclusive, but only if ceil( -R / s ) <= floor( -L / s )\n\nOtherwise, no overlap.\n\nThen for that car, 0 is in span for Δt from max(0, ceil( -R / s )) to min( something, but Δt can be any integer.\n\nIn our case, T starts from 5, but Δt from 0 up.\n\nBut for collision, we care about future turns.\n\nNow, let's list all cars on each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: three cars\n\nCar A: τ = -51, h = -40, s = 4\n\nL = τ = -51, R = h = -40\n\nThen -R = -(-40) = 40, -L = -(-51) = 51\n\ns = 4\n\nΔt >= ceil( -R / s ) = ceil(40 / 4) = ceil(10) = 10\n\nΔt <= floor( -L / s ) = floor(51 / 4) = floor(12.75) = 12\n\nSo for Δt from 10 to 12 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ = -15, h = -4, s =4\n\nL = -15, R = -4\n\n-R = 4, -L = 15\n\ns=4\n\nΔt >= ceil(4/4) = ceil(1) =1\n\nΔt <= floor(15/4) = floor(3.75) =3\n\nSo Δt=1,2,3\n\nCar C: τ=21, h=32, s=4\n\nL=21, R=32\n\n-R = -32, -L = -21\n\ns=4\n\nΔt >= ceil( (-32)/4 ) = ceil(-8) = -8\n\nBut Δt >=0, so ceil(-8) = -8, but since Δt >=0, the lower bound is max(0, ceil(-R/s)) = max(0, ceil(-32/4)) = max(0, -8) =0\n\nΔt <= floor( -L/s ) = floor( -21/4 ) = floor(-5.25) = -6? floor(-5.25) = -6, but Δt >=0, so floor(-21/4) = -5.25 floor is -6, but since Δt >=0, we need to consider if the inequality holds.\n\nFor car C, L + s Δt =21 +4 Δt >=21 >0 for Δt>=0, so L + s Δt >0, thus 0 <= R + s Δt is true since R+s Δt >=21>0, but L + s Δt >0, so 0 < L + s Δt <= R + s Δt, so 0 not <= left, so 0 not in [left,right] because left >0.\n\nSimilarly, for any car with L >0, since L + s Δt >0 for Δt>=0, and 0 < left, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, if R <0, right <0, so 0 not in.\n\nFor car C, R=32>0, L=21>0, so for all Δt, L + s Δt >=21>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for car A and B on freeway 1, car A has L=-51<0, R=-40<0, so possible.\n\nCar B L=-15<0, R=-4<0.\n\nCar C L=21>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1, only car A and B can cover 0.\n\nCar A: Δt from 10 to 12\n\nCar B: Δt from 1 to 3\n\nAt Δt=0, turn 5, we have car B: at t=5, span [-15,-4], 0 not in, as we saw.\n\nΔt=0: for car B, L + s*0 = -15 <=0? -15<=0 true, but R + s*0 = -4 <0? 0 <= R+s*0? 0 <= -4? False, so not both conditions.\n\nSimilarly, only when both.\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe when car A or car B has 0 in span.\n\nCar B unsafe for Δt=1,2,3 (turns 6,7,8)\n\nCar A unsafe for Δt=10,11,12 (turns 15,16,17)\n\nAnd car C never.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at turns: 6,7,8,15,16,17\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nTurns: Δt=1,2,3 and 10,11,12\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so same unsafe turns: 6,7,8,15,16,17\n\nNow freeway 3: cars\n\nFirst car: h=60, τ=49, s=6 → L=τ=49, R=h=60, both >0, so never cover 0.\n\nSecond car: h=24, τ=13, s=6 → L=13, R=24, both >0, never cover 0.\n\nThird car: h=-12, τ=-23, s=6 → L=τ=-23, R=h=-12\n\nThen -R = 12, -L = 23\n\ns=6\n\nΔt >= ceil( -R/s ) = ceil(12/6) = ceil(2) =2\n\nΔt <= floor( -L/s ) = floor(23/6) = floor(3.833) =3\n\nSo Δt=2,3 (turns 7,8)\n\nNow, at Δt=0, turn 5: L + s*0 = -23 <=0 true, R + s*0 = -12 <0, 0 <= -12 false, so not covered.\n\nOnly at Δt=2,3.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at turns 7 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3, so unsafe at 7,8.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12 → L=τ=-59, R=h=-48\n\n-R =48, -L=59\n\ns=12\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\nΔt <= floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4\n\nSo Δt=4 only (turn 9)\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/12)=4, Δt <= floor(59/12)=4, so only Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, L + s*4 = -59 + 48 = -11? s=12, Δt=4, L + s Δt = -59 + 12*4 = -59+48= -11\n\nR + s Δt = -48 + 48 =0\n\nSo span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nSecond car: h=36, τ=25, s=12 → L=25, R=36, both >0, never cover 0.\n\nThird car: h=0, τ=-11, s=12 → L=τ=-11, R=h=0\n\nThen -R =0, -L=11\n\ns=12\n\nΔt >= ceil( -R/s ) = ceil(0/12) = ceil(0) =0\n\nΔt <= floor( -L/s ) = floor(11/12) = floor(0.916) =0\n\nSo Δt=0 only.\n\nAt Δt=0, turn 5, span [L, R] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nSo for freeway 5, car 3 covers at Δt=0 (turn 5), car 1 covers at Δt=4 (turn 9), car 2 never.\n\nSo unsafe at turn 5 and turn 9.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car: h=54, τ=43, s=3 → L=43, R=54, both >0, never cover 0. So freeway 6 always safe.\n\nNo car covers 0 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car: h=0, τ=-23, s=24 → L=τ=-23, R=h=0\n\nThen -R =0, -L=23\n\ns=24\n\nΔt >= ceil(0/24) = ceil(0) =0\n\nΔt <= floor(23/24) = floor(0.958) =0\n\nSo only Δt=0, turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, span [-23,0], 0 in it.\n\nSo unsafe only at turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, unsafe only at turn 5.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\ny=1: unsafe at turns 6,7,8,15,16,17\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe 6,7,8,15,16,17\n\ny=3: unsafe at 7,8\n\ny=4: unsafe at 7,8\n\ny=5: unsafe at 5 and 9\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at 5\n\ny=8: unsafe at 5\n\nNow, I start at turn 5, y=1.\n\nAt turn 5, y=1 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I might want to go to y=6 quickly and stay there, but I need to go up to 9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at turn 5, but later might be safe.\n\nFor y=7, unsafe only at turn 5, so after turn 5, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8, unsafe only at turn 5, so for turn 6 and later, safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at turn 5 and turn 9.\n\nTurn 5 is now, and I'm not on y=5.\n\nTurn 9 is future.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at turn 7 and 8.\n\ny=1 and y=2 unsafe at 6,7,8 and 15-17, but 15-17 is late, might not be issue.\n\nNow, I am at turn 5, y=1.\n\nI need to take actions to move up.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so at least 8 up moves, but I can stay or move down, which would increase turns, so minimal should be exactly 8 moves up, in 8 turns, to reach y=9 at turn 13? Let's see.\n\nStart turn 5, y=1.\n\nAfter one action, turn 6, y= y1 + Δy, etc.\n\nIf I always move up, starting from turn 5:\n\nTurn 5: at y=1\n\nAction a_5: U, then turn 6: y=2\n\na_6: U, turn 7: y=3\n\na_7: U, turn 8: y=4\n\na_8: U, turn 9: y=5\n\na_9: U, turn 10: y=6\n\na_10: U, turn 11: y=7\n\na_11: U, turn 12: y=8\n\na_12: U, turn 13: y=9\n\nNow, check collision at each turn.\n\nAt turn 5: y=1, safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=2, unsafe? y=2 unsafe at turn 6, yes, from above, turn 6 is unsafe for y=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe at turns 6,7,8.\n\nSo at turn 6, if I am on y=2, I collide.\n\nSo this path has collision at turn 6.\n\nNot good.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=2 at turn 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at turn 6,7,8 unsafe, but I start at y=1 turn 5, which is safe, but I need to leave.\n\nAt turn 5, I can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at turn 5, a_5=S, then turn 6 I am still at y=1.\n\nBut y=1 at turn 6 is unsafe, so if I stay at turn 5, I am at y=1 turn 6, which is unsafe, collide.\n\nSo I cannot stay at turn 5; I must move to avoid y=1 at turn 6.\n\nOptions: move up to y=2 or move down to y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient.\n\nMove up to y=2 at turn 6, but y=2 at turn 6 is unsafe.\n\nSo both U and D are bad? U to y=2 at turn 6 unsafe, S stay at y=1 turn 6 unsafe, D down to y=0 turn 6.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo possible to move down to avoid.\n\nBut then I need to come back up, which takes more turns.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 temporarily.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nI need to be on y=1 to y=8 at safe times.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I might go to y=6 as fast as possible and then to 9.\n\nBut y=6 is at row 6, I am at y=1, so I need to go up 5 steps to y=6.\n\nBut to go from y=1 to y=6, need at least 5 up moves.\n\nBut the path may have delays.\n\nFirst, from turn 5, y=1, I must not be on y=1 at turn 6, so I must move.\n\nIf I move up, to y=2 at turn 6, but y=2 unsafe at turn 6.\n\nIf I move down, to y=0 at turn 6.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nThen at turn 6, I am at y=0.\n\nThen I can move up to y=1 at turn 7, or stay, or down, but down to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so only S or U.\n\nBut y=0, no freeway, safe.\n\nNow, at turn 7, if I go to y=1, is y=1 safe at turn 7? y=1 unsafe at turn 7, yes, from above.\n\ny=1 unsafe at 6,7,8, so turn 7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=2 at turn 7, y=2 unsafe at turn 7.\n\nSo at turn 6, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to choose action at turn 6.\n\na_6: if U, to y=1 at turn 7, but y=1 unsafe turn 7.\n\nIf S, stay y=0, safe, but not progressing.\n\nIf D, cannot, y=0.\n\nSo only U or S.\n\nIf I S at turn 6, stay y=0, then turn 7 still y=0.\n\nThen I can U at turn 7 to y=1 at turn 8? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 7, if I U, then at turn 8 I am at y=1.\n\nBut y=1 unsafe at turn 8, so collide.\n\nIf at turn 7 I S, stay y=0, then turn 8 y=0.\n\nThen U at turn 8 to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nNow turn 9, y=1, is it safe? y=1 unsafe only at 6,7,8,15-17, so turn 9 is safe for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at turn 9 should be safe, since unsafe only 6,7,8,15-17.\n\nTurn 9 is after 8, so safe.\n\nSo let's try that.\n\nFrom turn 5: at y=1, must move, so move down to y=0.\n\na_5 = D, then at turn 6, y=0 (since y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5, Δy=-1 for D, so y_6=1-1=0)\n\nThen at turn 6, at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, I can stay or move up.\n\nIf I move up to y=1 at turn 7, but y=1 unsafe at turn 7, so collide.\n\nSo I should not go to y=1 at turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go to y=2 at turn 7, unsafe.\n\nSo at turn 6, I should stay at y=0.\n\na_6 = S, then y_7 = y_6 +0 =0, so at turn 7, y=0.\n\nThen at turn 7, I can S again or U.\n\nIf U, y_8 =1, but turn 8 y=1 unsafe, collide.\n\nSo must S again or something.\n\nAt turn 7, S, then turn 8 y=0.\n\nThen at turn 8, U to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 y=1 safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, I can move up.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 5: y=1, action D, go to y=0 at turn 6\n\nTurn 6: y=0, action S, stay y=0 at turn 7\n\nTurn 7: y=0, action S, stay y=0 at turn 8? No.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at y=0, I take action a_7.\n\nIf a_7 = S, then y_8 = y_7 +0 =0, so at turn 8, y=0.\n\nThen at turn 8, I take a_8, if U, then y_9 =1.\n\nAt turn 9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can move up.\n\nBut this took many turns to just stay low.\n\nFrom turn 9 y=1, I can go up.\n\nBut y=2,3,4,5 have unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, y=3 and y=4 unsafe at turn 7 and 8, but turn 7 and 8 are past? Turn 9 is later.\n\nTurn 7 and 8 are before turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I want to go to y=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe at 6,7,8,15-17, so at turn 9, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3 unsafe at 7,8, so turn 9 safe.\n\ny=4 same.\n\ny=5 unsafe at turn 5 and 9.\n\nTurn 5 is past, turn 9 is current.\n\nAt turn 9, if I am on y=5, unsafe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at turn 9.\n\nSo at turn 9, if I go to y=5, collide.\n\nBut at turn 9, I am at y=1, if I move up.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 9: at y=1, I take action a_9.\n\nIf I U, then y_10 =2.\n\nBut at turn 9, I am on y=1, which is safe for freeway 1.\n\nThen a_9=U, so at turn 10, y=2.\n\nNow, turn 10, y=2, is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at 6,7,8,15-17, turn 10 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut y=5 at turn 9 is unsafe, but I am not on y=5 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at y=1.\n\nAfter a_9=U, at turn 10 y=2.\n\nThen a_10=U, turn 11 y=3.\n\na_11=U, turn 12 y=4.\n\na_12=U, turn 13 y=5.\n\nNow at turn 13, y=5, is it safe? y=5 unsafe at turn 5 and turn 9, turn 13 is later, so should be safe, since no other unsafe times.\n\ny=5 only unsafe at 5 and 9, so turn 13 safe.\n\nThen a_13=U, turn 14 y=6.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\na_14=U, turn 15 y=7.\n\nNow y=7 unsafe only at turn 5, turn 15 safe.\n\na_15=U, turn 16 y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at turn 5, turn 16 safe.\n\na_16=U, turn 17 y=9, done.\n\nBut at turn 15, y=7, and y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at turn 15? y=1 unsafe at 15,16,17, but I am on y=7 at turn 15, not on y=1, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, turn 16 y=8, fine.\n\nTurn 17 y=9, fine.\n\nBut how many turns? From turn 5 to turn 17, that's 13 turns? Let's count actions.\n\nStart turn 5, position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 5+H, position y_{5+H}.\n\nWe want y_{5+H} =9.\n\nActions from t=5 to 5+H-1.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt turn 5: start y=1\n\na_5: D (to y=0 at turn 6)\n\na_6: S (y=0 at turn 7)\n\na_7: S (y=0 at turn 8)  // I think I missed something\n\nEarlier:\n\nTurn 5: a_5=D, go to y=0 at turn 6\n\nTurn 6: a_6=S, stay y=0 at turn 7\n\nTurn 7: a_7=S, stay y=0 at turn 8\n\nTurn 8: a_8=U, go to y=1 at turn 9\n\nTurn 9: a_9=U, go to y=2 at turn 10\n\nTurn 10: a_10=U, go to y=3 at turn 11\n\nTurn 11: a_11=U, go to y=4 at turn 12\n\nTurn 12: a_12=U, go to y=5 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: a_13=U, go to y=6 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: a_14=U, go to y=7 at turn 15\n\nTurn 15: a_15=U, go to y=8 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16: a_16=U, go to y=9 at turn 17\n\nNow, at turn 17, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_5 to a_16, that's 12 actions? Turns: actions at 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 → 12 actions.\n\nH=12, reached at turn 5+12=17.\n\nBut is this minimal? Probably not, since I wasted time at y=0.\n\nI could go directly to y=6 which is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to go through y=2,3,4,5, which have unsafe times around now.\n\nSince y=6 always safe, if I can reach y=6 by turn 9 or something.\n\ny=5 is unsafe at turn 9, so I need to avoid y=5 at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 unsafe at turn 6,7,8.\n\nTurn 5 is safe for y=1.\n\nAt turn 5, y=1, I must move to avoid being at y=1 on turn 6.\n\nI could move up, but y=2 at turn 6 unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=2 at a different time.\n\ny=2 safe after turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to y=3 or y=4, but y=3 unsafe at turn 7,8.\n\ny=4 same.\n\ny=5 unsafe at turn 9.\n\nBut turn 9 is later.\n\nAt turn 5, after action, I go to y at turn 6.\n\nIf I go U, to y=2 at turn 6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go S, to y=1 turn 6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=0 turn 6, safe.\n\nThen from y=0, I can go to y=1 only when safe, which is after turn 8.\n\nBut turn 9 y=1 safe.\n\nBut to go to y=1 from y=0, I need one U, at turn T, to be at y=1 at turn T+1.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, if I am at y=0, I can U to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 y=1 safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=0 earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 directly from y=1, but I have to go through intermediate ys.\n\nThe only way is to move vertically step by step.\n\nI could stay on y=1 until it is safe to move, but y=1 unsafe at 6,7,8, so I cannot stay, I must leave before turn 6.\n\nAt turn 5, I am at y=1, I take action, which affects where I am at turn 6.\n\nI could move down to y=0 at turn 6, as before.\n\nThen from there, instead of waiting, I could go up later.\n\nBut to minimize, I need to move up as soon as possible.\n\nWhat if at turn 5, I move down to y=0 at turn 6.\n\nThen at turn 6, I am at y=0, I can move up to y=1 at turn 7, but y=1 unsafe at turn 7, so not possible.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=0 for some turns until I can move up safely.\n\ny=1 safe after turn 8, so at turn 8, I can be at y=0, then U to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=1, I can go up.\n\nBut when I go to y=5, I need to avoid turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, if I am on y=5, unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 13 I am on y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut I can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=1 at turn 9, then U to y=2 at turn 10, etc., but y=5 at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is later than turn 9, but turn 9 is unsafe for y=5, so I cannot be on y=5 at turn 9, but at other times ok.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=5 is turn 10 or later, but let's see.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 9, U turn 10 y=2, U turn 11 y=3, U turn 12 y=4, U turn 13 y=5, same as before.\n\nCan I reach y=5 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at a higher y earlier.\n\nBut at turn 5, I start at y=1.\n\nIf I don't move down, but I have to, because I cannot stay or move up at turn 5 without colliding at turn 6.\n\nUnless I move to a freeway that is safe at turn 6.\n\nBut y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn 6.\n\ny=3 at turn 6: is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at turn 7 and 8, so turn 6 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe at 7,8, so turn 6 safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at 5 and 9, turn 6 safe.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at 5, turn 6 safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at 5, turn 6 safe.\n\nSo at turn 6, y=3,4,5,6,7,8 are all safe, except that I need to be on them, but I start from y=1 at turn 5.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 5, I can only move to y=0,1,2 at turn 6.\n\ny=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe at turn 6.\n\nSo only y=0 is safe at turn 6.\n\nI cannot reach y=3 directly from y=1 in one move; I can only change by -1,0,+1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=1, at turn 6, I can only be at y=0,1,2.\n\nAll of which are unsafe except y=0.\n\nSo I must go to y=0 at turn 6.\n\nThen from y=0 at turn 6, I can move to y=1 at turn 7, but y=1 unsafe at turn 7.\n\nOr to y=0 at turn 7 (stay), or cannot down.\n\nSo if I U at turn 6, to y=1 at turn 7, unsafe.\n\nIf S, stay y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 7, same situation; if I U to y=1 at turn 8, y=1 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nIf I stay, y=0.\n\nThen at turn 8, if I U to y=1 at turn 9, safe.\n\nSo I have to spend three turns at y=0: turns 6,7,8 all at y=0, then to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nThen from there, up to y=9 in 8 moves, but from y=1 to y=9, 8 up moves, taking 8 turns, from turn 9 to turn 17, same as before.\n\nBut at turn 9, y=1, a_9=U to y=2 turn 10, a_10=U to y=3 turn 11, a_11=U to y=4 turn 12, a_12=U to y=5 turn 13, a_13=U to y=6 turn 14, a_14=U to y=7 turn 15, a_15=U to y=8 turn 16, a_16=U to y=9 turn 17.\n\nYes, 12 actions.\n\nBut can I save time by going to a safe freeway earlier?\n\nFor example, y=6 is always safe, so if I can reach y=6 faster.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to be at y=5 or y=7 first, but y=7 is safe after turn 5.\n\ny=7 unsafe only at turn 5, so for turn 6 and later, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nBut to reach y=6, from y=1, I need to go through y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\ny=2,3,4 have unsafe times between 6-8.\n\nSpecifically, y=2 unsafe 6,7,8; y=3 unsafe 7,8; y=4 unsafe 7,8.\n\nSo for example, at turn 9, I can be on y=2,3,4 all safe.\n\nThen I can go up quickly.\n\nBut to be on y=2 at turn 9, for example.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nFrom turn 5, I go to y=0 at turn 6.\n\nThen at turn 6, I stay y=0.\n\nTurn 7, stay y=0.\n\nTurn 8, I U to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nBut y=1 at turn 9.\n\nIf I want to be at y=2 at turn 9, I need to be at y=1 or y=2 or y=3 at turn 8, and take action.\n\nAt turn 8, if I am at y=1, I can U to y=2 at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 8, if I am at y=1, y=1 is unsafe at turn 8, so I cannot be on y=1 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at turn 8 unsafe, y=3 at turn 8 unsafe.\n\ny=4 at turn 8 unsafe.\n\nAll freeways from 1 to 4 unsafe at turn 8.\n\ny=5 at turn 8: y=5 unsafe only at 5 and 9, turn 8 safe.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nBut at turn 8, I am at y=0, from previous.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at y=0, I can U to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nI cannot reach y=2 directly from y=0; I have to go to y=1 first.\n\nSo at turn 9, I am at y=1, then U to y=2 at turn 10, etc.\n\nCannot be at y=2 at turn 9.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=2 is turn 10, by being at y=1 at turn 9 and U.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at turn 11, and so on.\n\ny=5 at turn 13.\n\nThen to y=6 at turn 14.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can stay there or move up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps from y=0, I can go to a higher freeway directly, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so no.\n\nAnother idea: move up at turn 5 to y=2, but y=2 at turn 6 unsafe, so collide, not possible.\n\nOr, at turn 5, move down to y=0 turn 6, then at turn 6, since y=3 is safe at turn 6, but I am at y=0, I can only go to y=1, which is unsafe, or stay.\n\nI cannot jump to y=3.\n\nSo I think the only way is to stay at y=0 for turns 6,7,8, then start from y=1 at turn 9.\n\nThen it takes 8 more turns to reach y=9, total from turn 5 to turn 17, 12 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: y=1, safe (as checked)\n\nTurn 6: y=0, safe (no freeway)\n\nTurn 7: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 9: y=1, safe (not 6,7,8)\n\nTurn 10: y=2, safe (not 6,7,8,15-17 yet)\n\nTurn 11: y=3, safe (unsafe only 7,8, turn 11 ok)\n\nTurn 12: y=4, safe (similar)\n\nTurn 13: y=5, safe (unsafe at 5 and 9, turn 13 ok)\n\nTurn 14: y=6, always safe\n\nTurn 15: y=7, safe (unsafe only turn 5)\n\nTurn 16: y=8, safe (unsafe only turn 5)\n\nTurn 17: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nSo it works with 12 actions.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFor example, at turn 8, instead of going to y=1 at turn 9, can I go directly to a safer y?\n\nBut I have to go through y=1.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, if I can reach it earlier.\n\nSuppose at turn 5, I go down to y=0 turn 6.\n\nThen at turn 6, I stay y=0.\n\nBut at turn 7, if I could be at y=3, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can move up at a later turn to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, y=5 is unsafe at turn 9, so I need to not be on y=5 at turn 9.\n\nIn the above, I am on y=5 at turn 13, fine.\n\nBut if I can be on y=5 before turn 9 or after, but before turn 9, the lower ys are unsafe.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, I am at y=1, if I could go up to y=5 quickly, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nFrom y=1, to y=5, at least 4 moves, so at turn 9, I could be at y=5 if I move up continuously.\n\nBut at turn 6, if I move up to y=2, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nStart at turn 5 y=1, a_5=U, to y=2 turn 6, but unsafe, collide.\n\nSo impossible to move up immediately.\n\nThus, the only safe way is to move down and wait.\n\nPerhaps I can move down and then up at a time when ys are safe.\n\nBut with 12 actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can save one turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, I am at y=0, I U to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nInstead, if I could be at y=1 at turn 8, but y=1 unsafe at turn 8, cannot.\n\nOr, at turn 7, if I am at y=0, I U to y=1 at turn 8, but turn 8 y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think 12 is the minimal.\n\nBut H is the number of turns for actions, from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, actions at turns 5 to 16, 12 actions, reach at turn 17.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by going to y=9 faster after.\n\nBut from y=1 at turn 9 to y=9 at turn 17, 8 turns, necessary since 8 steps.\n\nThe delay is from turn 5 to turn 9, I am stuck at y=0 for 3 turns (turns 6,7,8) but turn 6,7,8 I am at y=0, which is 3 actions to stay, but I could have moved if possible.\n\nAnother freeway: y=6 is always safe, but I can't reach it directly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 or something.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe after turn 5.\n\nBut to reach y=7, I need to be at y=6 or y=8 first, etc.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 5: D (from y=1 to y=0 at turn 6)\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 5, action D, so a_5 = D\n\nThen turn 6: action S, a_6 = S\n\nTurn 7: action S, a_7 = S\n\nTurn 8: action U, a_8 = U (to y=1 at turn 9)\n\nTurn 9: action U, a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: U, a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11: U, a_11 = U\n\nTurn 12: U, a_12 = U\n\nTurn 13: U, a_13 = U\n\nTurn 14: U, a_14 = U\n\nTurn 15: U, a_15 = U\n\nTurn 16: U, a_16 = U\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut from y=1 at turn 9 to y=9 at turn 17, that's 8 moves: turn 9 to 10: y2, turn10-11:y3, ..., turn16-17:y9, yes.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=6, and y=6 is safe, I could stay or move, but moving up is fine.\n\nPerhaps from y=6, I can go directly to y=9, but I can only change by 1, so need 3 moves: to y=7,8,9.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nBut in the action list, I have a_5 to a_16, 12 actions.\n\nAnswer format should be from turn t_1.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: a_{t_1} = D\n\nTurn 6: a_{t_1 +1} = S\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 16: a_{t_1 + 11} since t_1 +11 =5+11=16.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet t from 0 to H-1.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, t=0: a_5, t=1: a_6, ..., up to t=11: a_{16}\n\nThen after, at turn t_1 + H =5+12=17, y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce.\n\nNotice that at turn 9, y=5 is unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nBut in the sequence, I go through y=5 at turn 13, fine.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at turn 9 or something.\n\nBut turn 9 y=4: y=4 unsafe only at turn 7 and 8, turn 9 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at turn 9, I need to be at y=3,4,5 at turn 8 and take action.\n\nAt turn 8, y=3,4,5 all unsafe except y=5.\n\ny=3 unsafe turn 8, y=4 unsafe turn 8, y=5 safe turn 8.\n\nBut at turn 8, I am at y=0, not on y=5.\n\nTo be at y=5 at turn 8, I need to have been at y=4,5,6 at turn 7 with action.\n\nBut at turn 7, y=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe? y=5 unsafe at turn 5 and 9, turn 7 safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at 5 and 9, so turn 7 safe.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nBut at turn 7, I am at y=0, from previous.\n\nTo reach y=5 at turn 8, I need to be at y=4 or y=5 or y=6 at turn 7.\n\nBut at turn 7, if I were at y=4, y=4 unsafe at turn 7, collide.\n\nIf at y=5, turn 7 safe, but how to be at y=5 at turn 7.\n\nFrom start: at turn 5 y=1, if I could go to y=5 by turn 7, but need 4 moves in 2 turns? Impossible, max 2 moves up, to y=3 at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 5, a_5=U, to y=2 turn 6, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo cannot reach higher ys earlier.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I have three S at y=0, which are wasteful, but necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can move up to y=6 directly after waiting less, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: since y=6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 and stay until I can go up, but I need to reach it first.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to avoid the unsafe times of lower ys.\n\nThe critical period is turns 6-8 for y=1-4.\n\nAfter turn 8, all ys are safe except y=5 at turn 9.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at turn 9, so after turn 9, all safe.\n\nAt turn 9, y=1,2,3,4,6,7,8 safe, y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo at turn 9, I can be on y=1,2,3,4,6,7,8.\n\nBut to be on y=6, I need to have come from y=5 or y=7.\n\nBut y=5 at turn 9 unsafe, so I cannot be on y=5 at turn 9.\n\nTherefore, at turn 9, I cannot be on y=6 if I come from y=5, because to be at y=6 at turn 9, I must have been at y=5 at turn 8 or y=6 at turn 8 or y=7 at turn 8, and take action at turn 8.\n\nBut at turn 8, y=5 is safe, y=6 safe, y=7 safe.\n\nBut I am at y=0 at turn 8, so I can only go to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nCannot reach y=6 directly.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence with 12 actions seems necessary.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the actions clearly.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nNow, in terms of t_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: a_{5} = D\n\nTurn 6: a_{6} = S\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = S\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nAfter action at turn 16, at turn 17, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_t for t=5 to 16.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose at turn 5, I do D to y=0 turn 6.\n\nThen at turn 6, instead of staying, I must stay or go up to y=1, which is unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 and then at turn 7 or 8, but same.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are safe after turn 5, if I can reach them.\n\nBut to reach y=7, I need to be at y=6 or y=8 first, which requires lower ys.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at turn 6: from y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at turn 5 with action.\n\nAt turn 5, I am at y=1, I can go to y=2 at turn 6, but unsafe, or to y=0.\n\nNot to y=7.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, I think 12 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 0\\) to avoid unsafe times on the lower freeways and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) once it is safe.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Turn 5 (y=1)**: Safe, as no car on freeway 1 has 0 in its span at turn 5.\n- **Turns 6-8 (y=0)**: Safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no freeway.\n- **Turn 9 (y=1)**: Safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only at turns 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17.\n- **Turn 10 (y=2)**: Safe, as freeway 2 is unsafe only at turns 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17.\n- **Turn 11 (y=3)**: Safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turns 7 and 8.\n- **Turn 12 (y=4)**: Safe, as freeway 4 is unsafe only at turns 7 and 8.\n- **Turn 13 (y=5)**: Safe, as freeway 5 is unsafe only at turns 5 and 9.\n- **Turn 14 (y=6)**: Safe, as freeway 6 is always safe (no car covers 0 at any turn).\n- **Turn 15 (y=7)**: Safe, as freeway 7 is unsafe only at turn 5.\n- **Turn 16 (y=8)**: Safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn 5.\n- **Turn 17 (y=9)**: Reached the goal, and \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are taken at turns \\(t_1 + t = 5 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(11\\) (since \\(H = 12\\), resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(5 + 12 = 17\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, starting at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 when we are on that freeway at the same turn.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nNote: The player updates at the same time as the cars. So at each turn, the player chooses an action (U, D, S) and then both the player and the cars move.\n\nAlso note: When we move from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, at that turn T we are still on the old row (y) for the entire turn. Then at turn T+1, we are on the new row (y+1 or y-1). Therefore, at the moment of the move (during turn T) we only check the cars on the current row (y) and not the row we are moving to.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn (say T) meaning that at turn T we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 6, position (0,0). We must avoid collisions on rows 1 to 8 when we are on that row at a given turn.\n\nWe are given the car configurations at turn 6 (the current state). For each car, we know its head, tail, direction, and speed. Note the representation:\n\nFor a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the update rule says:\n- Left-moving: at turn t1, the car span is [h, τ] and then at turn T>t1, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So the head h is the larger number? Actually, in the update for left-moving, both head and tail decrease by s per turn, so the car is moving leftward.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So τ is the left end and h the right end? Actually, the problem writes for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So τ is the tail (left end) and h is the head (right end).\n\nBut note the given data:\n\nFor example, freeway 1: \n  Cars: (-36, -47, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4)\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the representation is (head, tail, ...) or (tail, head, ...)? The problem says for a right-moving car: Span(t1)= [τ, h] meaning from τ to h (with τ < h). However, in the table, the first car is (-36, -47, right, 4). But note: -36 > -47, so if we interpret as (τ, h) then τ=-47, h=-36? But the problem writes (head, tail). \n\nWait, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". So the first car on freeway 1: head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=4.\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the head should be the front (which is the rightmost) and the tail the back? So if the car is moving right, then the head is greater than the tail? But here head=-36 and tail=-47, which is correct because -36 > -47. And the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. Then at a future turn T, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-47 + 4*(T-6), -36 + 4*(T-6)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway 1: head=0, tail=-11 -> span at t1=[-11,0]. This car is at turn 6 covering from -11 to 0? Then at turn 6, if we are on freeway 1 at x=0, then we are in the car? But note: the player is at (0,0) at turn 6. However, the freeway we are on at turn 6 is row 0? The freeways are from 1 to 8. Row 0 and row 9 are safe? The problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So at row 0 and row 9, there are no cars? Therefore, we are safe at row 0 and row 9.\n\nSo we start at (0,0) at turn 6 (safe) and we want to get to (0,9) (safe).\n\nWe must traverse rows 1 to 8 without being hit by a car on that row at the same turn.\n\nWe need to compute for each row and for each turn after 6, whether there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to plan the moves: we can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe'll simulate the future turns, starting from turn 6, and we'll try to find a path from y=0 to y=9 in the fewest turns without stepping on a row that has a car at x=0 at the same turn.\n\nNote: We can also stay on a row for multiple turns, but we have to avoid the car on that row at every turn we are on it.\n\nWe'll compute the car positions for each freeway and each turn.\n\nWe are at turn 6. For a future turn T (>=6), the car on a freeway k will have its span as described.\n\nWe are only concerned with the x=0 position on the freeway at turn T.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T, we need to check if 0 is in the span of the car? Actually, the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that turn T, there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the span of that car.\n\nSo for each freeway k (1 to 8) and each turn T, we can precompute whether there is at least one car that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe can create a grid: rows 1 to 8, and for each turn T (starting from 6) we mark if that row is occupied (i.e., unsafe) at that turn.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously. We are given the state at turn 6. Then for each car, we can compute the span at any turn T.\n\nLet me define:\n\nFor a right-moving car (d='right') at turn 6: \n   tail0 = τ (given as the second number in the tuple for that car)\n   head0 = h (the first number)\n\nBut wait: the table says (head h, tail τ). So for a car: (h, τ, d, s)\n\nThen for a right-moving car:\n   At turn T, the tail = τ + s*(T-6)\n   The head = h + s*(T-6)\n\nAnd the span is [τ + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)]\n\nFor a left-moving car: we don't have any in this problem? Let me check: all cars in the given data are right-moving? Yes, all are 'right'. So we don't have left-moving.\n\nSo only right-moving cars.\n\nTherefore, for a car (h, τ, 'right', s) at turn 6, at turn T>=6:\n   tail = τ + s*(T-6)\n   head = h + s*(T-6)\n\nAnd the span is [tail, head] = [τ + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)]\n\nWe then check if 0 is in the interval [τ + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)].\n\nNote: Since the car is moving right, the entire segment is shifting to the right.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k (1 to 8) and each turn T (>=6) if there is at least one car on that freeway such that 0 is between tail and head (inclusive).\n\nBut note: the freeway k has multiple cars? Yes, for example freeway 1 has 3 cars.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, we check every car on that freeway.\n\nLet's precompute the unsafe conditions for each row (1-8) for turns starting from 6.\n\nWe are going to simulate for T from 6 to, say, 6+20 (we don't know how many turns we need, but we can set a limit).\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car1: h=-36, τ=-47, s=4\n  car2: h=0, τ=-11, s=4\n  car3: h=36, τ=25, s=4\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  Yes: (-36,-47,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nFreeway 3:\n  car1: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n  car2: h=30, τ=19, s=6\n  car3: h=-6, τ=-17, s=6\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5:\n  car1: h=-36, τ=-47, s=12\n  car2: h=48, τ=37, s=12\n  car3: h=12, τ=1, s=12\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (57,46,right,3)\n\nFreeway 7: (24,1,right,24)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (24,1,right,24)\n\nNow, we compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=6) whether the row k is unsafe (i.e., at least one car covers 0).\n\nWe can write a function for a car: at turn T, the car covers 0 if:\n   tail(T) <= 0 <= head(T)\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, tail(T) = τ + s*(T-6) and head(T)=h+s*(T-6). Since the car is moving right, and initially at T=6, the car is at [τ, h] (with τ<=h).\n\nSo condition: τ + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nWe can rearrange:\n   0 >= τ + s*(T-6)  =>  s*(T-6) >= -τ   => T-6 >= ceil(-τ/s)   [if s>0]\n   0 <= h + s*(T-6)   => s*(T-6) >= -h   => T-6 >= ceil(-h/s)   [but wait, not exactly]\n\nActually, we have two inequalities:\n   τ + s*(T-6) <= 0   => T-6 >= ceil(( -τ ) / s)   [if we consider real numbers, but T is integer, so we can solve for T]\n\nBut note: the inequalities are linear. Alternatively, we can compute the interval of T for which the car covers 0.\n\nThe car covers 0 when:\n   τ + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n   ( -τ ) / s >= (T-6) >= ( -h ) / s   ??? Let me check:\n\nFrom τ + s*(T-6) <= 0: \n   s*(T-6) <= -τ\n   T-6 <= -τ / s   [if s>0, which it is]\n\nBut wait: if we have τ + s*(T-6) <= 0, then s*(T-6) <= -τ, so T-6 <= ceil(-τ/s) ? Actually, we are dealing with integers. We need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each car the exact turns T for which 0 is in the interval.\n\nBut note: the car is present at 0 for a continuous set of real T, but we are only at integer T. So we can compute:\n\n   The car covers 0 at integer T if:\n      τ + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nSince the car moves continuously, the set of T for which the condition holds is an interval of integers.\n\nWe can compute the smallest integer T_min such that the car has passed 0? Actually, we can solve:\n\n   The car covers 0 when the left end (tail) is <=0 and the right end (head) is >=0.\n\nThe time when the tail is at 0: T0 = 6 + (0 - τ)/s = 6 - τ/s\nThe time when the head is at 0: T1 = 6 + (0 - h)/s = 6 - h/s\n\nBut note: since the car is moving to the right, the tail arrives at 0 at T0 and the head leaves 0 at T1? Actually, when the head passes 0? The car covers 0 from the moment the tail is at 0 until the head is at 0? Actually, no: the car covers 0 from the moment the head passes 0 (from left) until the tail passes 0 (from left). But wait: the car is a segment. When the head is at 0, the car has just reached 0 (the front touches 0). Then the car remains covering 0 until the tail passes 0? Actually, when the head passes 0 (from left to right), the car starts covering 0. Then it continues until the tail passes 0? That would be when the entire car has passed 0.\n\nBut note: the car is [tail, head] and moving right. When the head is at 0, that is the first moment the car covers 0? Actually, when the head is at 0, then 0 is the head, so yes. Then the car continues to cover 0 until the tail is at 0? Actually, when the tail is at 0, then 0 is the tail, and the next moment the tail moves to the right of 0, then 0 is no longer covered.\n\nSo the car covers 0 from the time when the head is at 0 (which is T_head = 6 + (0 - head0)/s? but wait: at T=6, the head is at head0. We want when the head is at 0: so the displacement is (0 - head0) = -head0, and since speed is s, the time needed is (-head0)/s. So the time is T = 6 + (-head0)/s.\n\nSimilarly, the tail is at 0 at T = 6 + (0 - tail0)/s = 6 - tail0/s.\n\nBut note: because the car moves right, the head is the front. So the car covers 0 from the moment the head reaches 0 until the tail leaves 0? Actually, when the head is at 0, the car is covering 0. Then when the tail is at 0, the car is still covering 0? Actually, when the tail is at 0, the car is still covering 0. Then when the tail moves beyond 0, the car no longer covers 0.\n\nBut note: the head is always to the right of the tail. So the head reaches 0 first? Or the tail? Since the car moves right, the head (which is the front) reaches 0 first, and then later the tail passes 0. So the car covers 0 from when the head is at 0 to when the tail is at 0? Actually, no: the car covers 0 from the moment the head is at 0 (which is the first moment) until the tail is at 0 (which is the last moment). Then beyond that, the car has passed 0.\n\nBut wait: if the head is at 0 at time T1, then the car is covering 0 at T1. Then at time T2 when the tail is at 0, the car is still covering 0. Then at the next moment (if continuous) the tail moves to the right of 0, and the car no longer covers 0.\n\nSo the interval of T (continuous) is [T1, T2] where T1 = 6 + (0 - head0)/s and T2 = 6 + (0 - tail0)/s? Actually, that would be:\n\n   T1 = 6 - head0/s\n   T2 = 6 - tail0/s\n\nBut note: because head0 > tail0 (for a right-moving car) and head0 and tail0 are negative? or positive? \n\nExample: freeway 1, car2: head0=0, tail0=-11, s=4.\n\n   T1 = 6 - 0/4 = 6\n   T2 = 6 - (-11)/4 = 6 + 11/4 = 6 + 2.75 = 8.75\n\nSo at T=6, the head is at 0? Then the car covers 0 at T=6? Exactly: at T=6, the head is 0 and the tail is -11, so the car covers from -11 to 0, so 0 is covered.\n\nThen the car continues to cover 0 until T=8.75? Then at integer T, we have T=6,7,8: because at T=9, the tail would be at -11+4*(9-6)= -11+12=1, so the car is from 1 to 12? Then 0 is not covered.\n\nSo the integer T for which the car covers 0: T=6,7,8.\n\nBut note: T1=6, T2=8.75 -> integer T from ceil(T1) to floor(T2)? But T1=6 is integer, so we take T from 6 to 8? \n\nActually, the condition for integer T is:\n   T1 <= T <= T2   ? But T1=6, T2=8.75 -> T=6,7,8.\n\nBut what if T1 is not integer? For example, if head0 were 1, then T1=6 - 1/4 = 5.75, then the car starts covering 0 at T=6 (because at T=6, head=1+4*(0)=1, tail=-11+4*0=-11 -> so 0 is covered? yes). And at T=5: head=1+4*(-1)= -3, tail=-11-4=-15 -> doesn't cover 0. So the first integer T is ceil(T1)=6.\n\nSimilarly, T2=8.75: the last integer T for which the car covers 0 is floor(T2)=8.\n\nSo the set of integer T: T in [ceil(T1), floor(T2)] = [ceil(6 - head0/s), floor(6 - tail0/s)]\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the car is present at T>=6? Actually, the car state is given at T=6, and we are only considering T>=6.\n\nSo for each car, the unsafe turns on its freeway are the integers T in the interval [ceil(6 - head0/s), floor(6 - tail0/s)]?\n\nBut wait: let me check the condition again: the car covers 0 at turn T (>=6) if and only if:\n   tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head0 + s*(T-6)\n\nRearranged:\n   T-6 >= ceil(( -head0 ) / s)   ? Actually, from 0 <= head0 + s*(T-6) we have:\n        s*(T-6) >= -head0\n        T-6 >= ceil( (-head0) / s )   [if (-head0)/s is not integer, then we take ceil?]\n\nBut note: because T-6 is integer, we have:\n   T-6 >= ceil( (-head0) / s )   for the second inequality? But actually, we require s*(T-6) >= -head0. Since T-6 is integer, we have:\n        T-6 >= ceil( (-head0) / s )\n\nSimilarly, from the first inequality: tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0\n        s*(T-6) <= -tail0\n        T-6 <= floor( (-tail0) / s )   [because if (-tail0)/s is integer, then T-6 can be that, but if not, then we take the floor?]\n\nBut note: because s*(T-6) must be <= -tail0, then T-6 must be at most floor( (-tail0)/s )? Actually, let me test with the example:\n\n   head0=0, tail0=-11, s=4 -> (-head0)/s = 0/4=0 -> ceil(0)=0 -> T-6>=0 -> T>=6.\n   (-tail0)/s = 11/4=2.75 -> floor(2.75)=2 -> T-6<=2 -> T<=8.\n\nSo T in [6,8] -> T=6,7,8 -> correct.\n\nAnother example: freeway 1, car1: head0=-36, tail0=-47, s=4.\n   (-head0)/s = 36/4=9 -> ceil(9)=9 -> T-6>=9 -> T>=15.\n   (-tail0)/s = 47/4=11.75 -> floor(11.75)=11 -> T-6<=11 -> T<=17.\n   So T=15,16,17.\n\nBut let's check at T=15: \n   tail = -47 + 4*(15-6) = -47+36 = -11\n   head = -36 + 36 = 0 -> so 0 is covered? yes, [ -11, 0] covers 0.\n   T=17: tail=-47+4*11=-47+44=-3, head=-36+44=8 -> covers 0? yes.\n   T=18: tail=-47+48=1, head=-36+48=12 -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo T=15,16,17 -> correct.\n\nSo the unsafe turns for a car are T in [ T_low, T_high ] where:\n   T_low = 6 + ceil( (-head0) / s )   [but note: ceil( (-head0)/s ) is the smallest integer n such that n >= (-head0)/s, then T-6 = n -> T=6+n]\n   However, we can write:\n        T_low = ceil(6 + (-head0)/s)   [because 6 + (-head0)/s might not be integer, then ceil gives the next integer]\n\nBut note: 6 + (-head0)/s = (6*s - head0)/s, but we can compute:\n\n   T_low = 6 + ceil( (-head0) / s )\n   T_high = 6 + floor( (-tail0) / s )\n\nBut in the example: head0=0 -> ceil(0)=0 -> T_low=6.\n          tail0=-11 -> (-tail0)=11 -> 11/4=2.75 -> floor=2 -> T_high=8.\n\nAnother example: head0=-36 -> ceil(36/4)=ceil(9)=9 -> T_low=15.\n          tail0=-47 -> (-tail0)=47 -> 47/4=11.75 -> floor=11 -> T_high=17.\n\nSo that matches.\n\nTherefore, for each car, we can compute the interval [T_low, T_high] of turns (integers) for which the car covers 0 on its freeway.\n\nBut note: if the car never covers 0? For example, if head0 is positive and large, and tail0 is positive and large, then T_low might be greater than T_high? Actually, we should check: T_low must be <= T_high for the car to cover 0 at all. Otherwise, the car never covers 0.\n\nExample: freeway 6: car: (57,46,right,3) -> head0=57, tail0=46, both positive. \n   T_low = 6 + ceil( (-57)/3 ) = 6 + ceil(-19) = 6 -19 = -13 -> but we only consider T>=6, so we take max(6, -13)=6? \n   But wait: the condition T_low = 6 + ceil( (-head0)/s ) = 6 + ceil(-57/3)=6+ceil(-19)=6-19=-13. Then T_high = 6 + floor( (-46)/3 ) = 6 + floor(-15.333)=6-16=-10.\n\nSo the interval is [-13, -10] which is below 6 -> so at T>=6, the car is moving right and since at T=6 the car is at [46,57] (because tail=46+3*(0)=46, head=57) and then moves to the right, so 0 is never covered. So we mark that car as never unsafe for T>=6.\n\nSo we can ignore such cars.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5, car2: (48,37,right,12): \n   T_low = 6 + ceil(-48/12)=6+ceil(-4)=6-4=2 -> but T>=6, so we take max(6,2)=6? \n   Actually, we are computing for T>=6. The formula T_low = 6 + ceil( (-head0)/s ) might yield a number less than 6? Then we take the interval as [max(6, T_low), T_high]? But note: if T_high < 6, then the car doesn't cover 0 at any T>=6.\n\nFor this car: head0=48 -> ceil(-48/12)=ceil(-4)=-4 -> T_low=6-4=2.\n   tail0=37 -> (-tail0)/s = -37/12≈-3.083 -> floor(-3.083)=-4? Then T_high=6+floor(-37/12)=6+(-4)=2? \n   Actually: (-tail0)/s = -37/12 = -3.0833 -> floor(-3.0833) is -4? Because floor is the greatest integer less than or equal to -3.0833, which is -4.\n\nBut then T_high=2. Then the interval is [2,2]? But then at T=2: we are not considering because T>=6? So it doesn't matter.\n\nBut let's check: at T=6, the car is at [37+12*(0)=37, 48] -> so 0 is not covered. And at any T>=6, the car is moving to the right, so it will never cover 0. So we ignore.\n\nSo we can compute for each freeway k and for each turn T>=6, if there is at least one car on k that has T in [max(6, T_low), min(?, T_high)] and T_low<=T_high? Actually, we only consider if T_low<=T_high and T>=T_low and T<=T_high and T>=6.\n\nBut note: T_low and T_high are computed as above, and if T_low > T_high, then no T. Also, if T_high <6, then no T>=6.\n\nSo we can precompute for each freeway k (1-8) the set of turns T (>=6) that are unsafe.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n  car1: (h=-36, τ=-47, s=4)\n        T_low = 6 + ceil(36/4)=6+9=15\n        T_high=6+floor(47/4)=6+11=17   -> unsafe at T=15,16,17\n\n  car2: (h=0, τ=-11, s=4)\n        T_low=6+ceil(0/4)=6+0=6\n        T_high=6+floor(11/4)=6+2=8   -> unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\n  car3: (h=36, τ=25, s=4)\n        T_low=6+ceil(-36/4)=6+ceil(-9)=6-9=-3 -> but we take max(6,?) so we consider T>=6? Actually, the condition for T>=6: we require T_low<=T_high and T in [max(6,T_low), T_high] and T>=6. \n        But T_low=-3, T_high=6+floor(-25/4)=6+floor(-6.25)=6-7=-1 -> so the interval is [-3,-1] which is before 6. So not unsafe at T>=6.\n\nTherefore, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=6,7,8 (from car2) and T=15,16,17 (from car1). \n\nBut wait: at T=15,16,17, car1 is unsafe. At T=6,7,8, car2 is unsafe. And car3 is not unsafe for T>=6.\n\nSo overall freeway1: unsafe at T in {6,7,8,15,16,17}\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1 -> same unsafe set: {6,7,8,15,16,17}\n\nFreeway3: three cars\n  car1: (h=-48, τ=-59, s=6)\n        T_low = 6 + ceil(48/6)=6+8=14\n        T_high=6+floor(59/6)=6+9=15   -> unsafe at T=14,15? but wait: T_low=14, T_high=15 -> T=14,15.\n        But note: our formula T_high=6+floor( (-τ)/s ) = 6+floor(59/6)=6+9=15 -> so T=14,15.\n\n        Check: at T=14: \n            tail = -59 + 6*(14-6) = -59+48=-11\n            head = -48+48=0 -> covers 0? yes.\n        T=15: tail=-59+6*9=-59+54=-5, head=-48+54=6 -> covers 0? yes.\n        T=16: tail=-59+60=1, head=-48+60=12 -> not.\n\n        But wait: T_low=14 is the first unsafe turn? But at T=14, we have head=0, so it covers. So unsafe at T=14,15.\n\n  car2: (h=30, τ=19, s=6) -> both positive? \n        T_low=6+ceil(-30/6)=6+ceil(-5)=1 -> but we take max(6,1)=6? \n        But then T_high=6+floor(-19/6)=6+floor(-3.166)=6-4=2 -> so T_high=2 <6 -> no unsafe at T>=6.\n\n  car3: (h=-6, τ=-17, s=6)\n        T_low=6+ceil(6/6)=6+1=7\n        T_high=6+floor(17/6)=6+2=8   (since 17/6=2.833, floor=2)\n        So unsafe at T=7,8.\n\nTherefore, freeway3: \n   car1: T=14,15\n   car3: T=7,8\n   -> unsafe at T in {7,8,14,15}\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3 -> unsafe at {7,8,14,15}\n\nFreeway5: three cars\n  car1: (h=-36, τ=-47, s=12)\n        T_low=6+ceil(36/12)=6+3=9\n        T_high=6+floor(47/12)=6+3=9   (47/12=3.916, floor=3) -> unsafe at T=9 only.\n\n  car2: (h=48, τ=37, s=12) -> positive, so T_low=6+ceil(-48/12)=6-4=2, T_high=6+floor(-37/12)=6-4=2 -> interval [2,2] -> before 6 -> skip.\n\n  car3: (h=12, τ=1, s=12) -> positive? \n        T_low=6+ceil(-12/12)=6+ceil(-1)=5 -> but T>=6 -> T_low_adj=6\n        T_high=6+floor(-1/12)=6+floor(-0.083)=6-1=5 -> T_high=5 <6 -> skip.\n\n        Actually: (-τ)/s = (-1)/12 = -0.083 -> floor(-0.083)=-1 -> T_high=6-1=5 -> so no unsafe at T>=6.\n\n  So freeway5: unsafe only at T=9.\n\nFreeway6: one car: (57,46,right,3) -> positive -> T_low=6+ceil(-57/3)=6-19=-13, T_high=6+floor(-46/3)=6-16=-10 -> skip. \n        So freeway6 is always safe? \n\n        Check: at any T>=6, the car is at [46+3*(T-6), 57+3*(T-6)] -> both positive and increasing -> never covers 0. So safe.\n\nFreeway7: one car: (24,1,right,24)\n        T_low=6+ceil(-24/24)=6+ceil(-1)=5 -> so for T>=6, we take T_low_adj=6\n        T_high=6+floor(-1/24)=6+floor(-0.0416)=6-1=5 -> T_high=5 -> but 5<6 -> skip.\n\n        So freeway7 is always safe? \n\n        Check: at T=6: the car is at [1+24*0=1, 24] -> 0 not covered. Then moves right -> never covers 0.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> always safe.\n\nSo summary of unsafe rows by turn:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=6,7,8,15,16,17\nFreeway 2: same as 1: T=6,7,8,15,16,17\nFreeway 3: T=7,8,14,15\nFreeway 4: same as 3: T=7,8,14,15\nFreeway 5: T=9\nFreeway 6: safe at all T>=6\nFreeway 7: safe at all T>=6\nFreeway 8: safe at all T>=6\n\nWe now plan the moves:\n\nWe start at turn 6, y=0 (safe). We need to get to y=9 (safe) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS over (turn, y) states.\n\nThe state: (turn, y) at the beginning of the turn? Actually, at the start of turn T, we are at position (0,y). Then we choose an action (U,D,S) and then we move to a new y at the next turn (T+1). But during turn T, we are at y for the entire turn, and we check the freeway y at turn T: if y is between 1 and 8, then we must not be unsafe at turn T.\n\nNote: at turn 6, we are at y=0 -> safe (since row0 is safe). We are going to choose an action for turn 6, then at the end of turn 6 we move to y1 = y0 + Δy, and then at turn 7 we are at y1.\n\nBut during turn 6, we are at y=0 -> safe. Then we choose an action: if we choose U, then at turn 7 we will be at y=1. But during turn 7, we are at y=1 -> and we check freeway1 at turn7: which is unsafe (from above, freeway1 is unsafe at T=7). So we cannot be at freeway1 at turn7? Actually, we must avoid that.\n\nWe can only be at a row during a turn if that row is safe at that turn.\n\nWe'll do a BFS (or Dijkstra, since we want minimal turns) over states (t, y) where t is the current turn (at the start of the turn) and y is the current row.\n\nThe state: at the beginning of turn T, we are at row y.\n\nThen we choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then we will be at row y' = y + dy during the entire turn T? Actually, during turn T, we are still at row y. Then at the beginning of turn T+1, we are at row y'.\n\nBut the safety condition: during turn T, we are at row y. If y is 0 or 9, then safe. If y is 1-8, then we must check that the freeway y is safe at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we start at row y'.\n\nSo the transition:\n   From state (T, y), we choose an action a that leads to:\n        next_y = y + dy (clamped to [0,9])\n   Then the next state is (T+1, next_y)\n\nBut we must check that during turn T, we are at row y and that row y is safe at turn T.\n\nNote: at the start we are at (6,0). Then we choose an action for turn 6. During turn 6, we are at row0 (safe). Then we move to row y1 at turn7.\n\nWe want to find a sequence of actions until we are at row9 at the beginning of a turn? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning that at turn T (the turn when we are at y=9) we are at (0,9). And at that turn, we are at row9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: during the turn when we are at row9, we are safe. So we can stop at that turn.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H. H is the number of actions? The sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1, and at the end we are at (0,9).\n\nWe start at turn6. Then we take actions at turn6, turn7, ... until we are at row9 at the beginning of a turn? Actually, after H actions, we will have moved H steps, and we will be at turn6+H, and at the beginning of turn6+H we are at row y_{6+H}. We want y_{6+H}=9.\n\nBut note: at turn6, we are at row0. Then we take the first action at turn6: that moves us to row? at the beginning of turn7. So to be at row9 at the beginning of turn T, we need to have taken T-6 actions? And then we stop at turn T.\n\nWe can define:\n\n   Let T_start = 6, state (T, y) at the beginning of turn T.\n\n   We start at (6,0).\n\n   We want to reach (T,9) for some T>=6.\n\n   The cost is T-6 (the number of turns) and we want to minimize T-6.\n\n   The actions: at state (T,y), we choose an action a in {U,D,S} that leads to:\n\n        next_y = \n            if a='U': min(y+1,9)\n            if a='D': max(y-1,0)\n            if a='S': y\n\n        But note: we are constrained by the safety during turn T: we are at row y during turn T. If y is in {0,9} -> safe. If y in {1..8}, we must check that freeway y is safe at turn T.\n\n   Then we transition to (T+1, next_y).\n\nWe can do a BFS over T and y.\n\nWe'll let T go from 6 up to a sufficiently large number (say 20 or 25).\n\nWe keep a visited set for states (T,y) to avoid duplicates? But note: we might come to the same y at a later turn and that might be necessary to avoid an obstacle? But since we are minimizing T, we only need to consider the earliest time we get to a state.\n\nActually, we are minimizing the total turns (T-6). So we want the minimal T for which we get to y=9.\n\nWe can do a BFS by increasing T.\n\nWe'll initialize:\n\n   at T=6, y=0 -> safe.\n\n   Then we consider actions at T=6:\n\n        a='U': next_y = min(0+1,9)=1 -> then we would be at (T+1=7, y=1)\n               But during turn6, we are at y=0 (safe) -> so this move is allowed? \n               However, at the next state (7,1): during turn7 we will be at row1 -> and row1 at turn7 is unsafe (from freeway1: unsafe at T=7). So we cannot use this state? Actually, we haven't checked the safety of the next state? \n\n        Correction: when we are at state (T,y), we are about to start turn T. We choose an action. During turn T, we are at row y. We must check that row y is safe at turn T. Then we move to next_y at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\n        For the state (6,0): during turn6 we are at row0 -> safe. Then we choose U: so at turn7 we start at row1.\n\n        But then at the beginning of turn7, we are at row1. Then during turn7, we are at row1 -> and we must check that row1 is safe at turn7 -> which it is not (because freeway1 is unsafe at T=7). So we cannot be at row1 at turn7.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid that state.\n\n        Similarly, we can choose:\n\n        a='D': next_y = max(0-1,0)=0 -> state (7,0): during turn6: safe (row0). Then at turn7: we are at row0 -> safe? \n               But we are at row0 at turn7 -> safe. Then we can do that.\n\n        a='S': next_y=0 -> state (7,0) -> same as above.\n\nSo from (6,0) we can go to (7,0) by either D or S? But note: we are at row0 at turn6: safe. Then we move to row0 at turn7.\n\nWe can also try to move to other rows? But we cannot move to row1 at turn7 because it is unsafe.\n\nSo we start:\n\n   T=6: state (6,0) -> safe.\n\n   Actions: \n        U: would lead to (7,1) -> but row1 at turn7 is unsafe -> disallow.\n        D: leads to (7,0) -> during turn6: safe (row0) -> then at turn7: row0 -> safe -> allow.\n        S: leads to (7,0) -> same.\n\n   So we have two possibilities: D or S at turn6, both lead to (7,0).\n\nNow at T=7, state (7,0): safe (because row0).\n\n   Actions:\n        U: leads to (8,1) -> during turn7: we are at row0 -> safe. But then at turn8: we start at row1. Then during turn8: row1 at turn8 is unsafe? freeway1 unsafe at T=8 -> unsafe. So disallow.\n        D: leads to (8,0) -> safe during turn7 (row0) -> then at turn8: row0 -> safe -> allow.\n        S: leads to (8,0) -> same.\n\nSo again we can stay at row0.\n\nBut we need to move up eventually.\n\nWe note that freeway1 is unsafe at T=6,7,8 -> so we cannot be on row1 at turns 6,7,8? But we are at row0 at turns6,7,8, so we are avoiding row1 during these unsafe turns.\n\nAt turn9: freeway1 is safe? because unsafe only at 6,7,8,15,16,17 -> so at T=9, freeway1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 same as freeway1: safe at T=9.\n\nBut freeway3: unsafe at T=7,8,14,15 -> so at T=9, freeway3 is safe? \n   unsafe set: T in {7,8,14,15} -> so T=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway4: safe at T=9.\n\nFreeway5: unsafe only at T=9 -> so at T=9, freeway5 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway6,7,8: always safe.\n\nSo at turn9, we can be on row1,2,3,4? but row5 is unsafe at T=9.\n\nWe are at (7,0). We can wait until turn9 to move up? \n\nAt state (7,0): we can choose to go up at turn7? but that leads to row1 at turn8 -> which is unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nAt state (7,0): we can choose to go up at turn7? no, because that leads to row1 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at least until turn8 to move up? \n\nAt turn7: we are at row0. Then we choose an action for turn7: \n   U: leads to row1 at turn8 -> unsafe (freeway1 at T=8 unsafe) -> disallow.\n   D or S: lead to row0 at turn8.\n\nAt turn8: we are at row0. Then at turn8: we can choose:\n   U: leads to row1 at turn9. \n        During turn8: we are at row0 -> safe. Then at turn9: we start at row1. During turn9: row1 is safe (because freeway1 safe at T=9). So allow.\n\n   D or S: lead to row0 at turn9.\n\nSo we can move to row1 at turn9.\n\nNow, we are at (9,1): at the beginning of turn9, at row1.\n\nBut at turn9, we are at row1 -> we must check: freeway1 at turn9 is safe? yes, because unsafe only at 6,7,8,15,16,17.\n\nNow, we want to move to row2, but at turn9: \n   Can we move up to row2 at the next turn? \n        Action U: at turn9, we are at row1 (safe). Then we move to row2 at turn10.\n        At turn10: we are at row2. Then we check freeway2 at turn10: is it safe? \n            freeway2 unsafe at T in {6,7,8,15,16,17} -> T=10 is safe.\n\n        So we can move to row2 at turn10.\n\nBut we have to worry about freeway5 at turn9: but we are not on freeway5 at turn9, we are on freeway1 at turn9.\n\nSo from (9,1): \n   Actions: \n        U: to (10,2) -> safe? \n            during turn9: row1 -> safe (as above).\n            then at turn10: row2 -> safe? freeway2 safe at T=10 -> safe -> allow.\n        D: to (10,0) -> safe? \n            during turn9: row1 -> safe.\n            then at turn10: row0 -> safe -> allow.\n        S: to (10,1) -> then during turn10: row1 -> safe? freeway1 at T=10: safe? yes -> allow.\n\nBut we want to go to row9, so we choose U.\n\nSo at turn9: choose U -> then at turn10: state (10,2)\n\nThen at turn10: we are at row2 (freeway2) at turn10 -> safe (as above).\n\nThen we can move up again: \n   U: to (11,3) -> safe? \n        during turn10: row2 -> safe.\n        then at turn11: row3 -> check freeway3 at T=11: \n            freeway3 unsafe at T in {7,8,14,15} -> T=11 safe -> allow.\n\nSo we go to (11,3)\n\nThen at turn11: we are at row3. Then we can move up to row4: \n   U: to (12,4) -> \n        during turn11: row3 -> safe (freeway3 safe at T=11).\n        then at turn12: row4 -> freeway4 at T=12: unsafe set {7,8,14,15} -> safe -> allow.\n\nThen at turn12: we are at row4. Then we can move up to row5: \n   U: to (13,5) -> \n        during turn12: row4 -> safe.\n        then at turn13: row5 -> freeway5 at T=13: unsafe set {9} -> safe -> allow.\n\nThen at turn13: we are at row5. Then we can move up to row6: \n   U: to (14,6) -> \n        during turn13: row5 -> safe.\n        then at turn14: row6 -> freeway6 is always safe -> allow.\n\nBut note: freeway3 and freeway4 are unsafe at T=14? But we are on row6 at turn14, so we only care about freeway6 at turn14 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn14: we are at row6. Then we can move up to row7: \n   U: to (15,7) -> \n        during turn14: row6 -> safe.\n        then at turn15: row7 -> freeway7 is always safe? -> safe -> allow.\n\nBut wait: freeway1 and freeway2 are unsafe at T=15? But we are on row7 at turn15 -> so we only care about freeway7 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can move up to row8 and then row9.\n\nBut let me check: at turn15, we are at row7 -> safe. Then we can choose U to go to row8 at turn16: \n   during turn15: row7 -> safe.\n   then at turn16: row8 -> freeway8 always safe -> safe.\n\nThen at turn16: row8 -> then U to row9 at turn17: \n   during turn16: row8 -> safe.\n   then at turn17: row9 -> safe.\n\nSo we have a path:\n\n   Turn6: start at (6,0)\n   Turn6: we choose ... but we have to choose an action at each turn.\n\n   We waited at row0 until turn8: then at turn8 we moved up to row1 at turn9.\n\n   But above we started moving at turn9? Actually, we were at row0 at turn6,7,8. Then at turn8: we choose U -> so at the beginning of turn9 we are at row1.\n\n   Then:\n        turn9: at row1 -> choose U -> at turn10: row2\n        turn10: at row2 -> choose U -> at turn11: row3\n        turn11: at row3 -> choose U -> at turn12: row4\n        turn12: at row4 -> choose U -> at turn13: row5\n        turn13: at row5 -> choose U -> at turn14: row6\n        turn14: at row6 -> choose U -> at turn15: row7\n        turn15: at row7 -> choose U -> at turn16: row8\n        turn16: at row8 -> choose U -> at turn17: row9\n\n   So we reach row9 at turn17.\n\n   Total turns: from turn6 to turn17: 12 actions? Actually, the actions are taken at turns 6,7,...,16 (11 actions) and then at turn17 we are at row9? \n\n   But note: at the beginning of turn17, we are at row9 -> so we don't need to take an action at turn17? \n\n   The problem: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and at the end we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Actually, the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1}. Then after H actions, we have moved H steps. \n\n   We start at turn6: before any action, we are at (0,0). Then after the first action (at turn6), we are at the beginning of turn7 at y1. Then after H actions, we are at the beginning of turn6+H.\n\n   We want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn6+H.\n\n   In the above, we are at row9 at the beginning of turn17. So 17-6 = 11 actions? \n\n   But let's count the actions:\n\n        turn6: action (to move to row? at turn7) -> we are at row0 at turn7: so we must have chosen D or S at turn6.\n        turn7: similarly, we are at row0 at turn8: so D or S.\n        turn8: choose U -> to row1 at turn9.\n        turn9: U -> to row2 at turn10.\n        turn10: U -> to row3 at turn11.\n        turn11: U -> to row4 at turn12.\n        turn12: U -> to row5 at turn13.\n        turn13: U -> to row6 at turn14.\n        turn14: U -> to row7 at turn15.\n        turn15: U -> to row8 at turn16.\n        turn16: U -> to row9 at turn17.\n\n   So we have 11 actions: turns6 to turn16.\n\n   H=11.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe started moving at turn8. Why not move earlier? \n\nWe could not move to row1 at turn9 earlier because we had to avoid row1 at turns7 and8. So we had to wait until turn8 to move up (then we arrive at row1 at turn9).\n\nBut what if we move to row0 at turn6, then at turn7 we move to row0 again, and at turn8 we move to row1? that is what we did.\n\nIs there a way to get to row1 at turn9 without taking two turns at row0? We started at row0 at turn6. We cannot move to row1 at turn7 (because then at turn7 we would be at row1 -> unsafe). So we must avoid row1 at turn7. Similarly, we cannot be at row1 at turn8. So the earliest we can be at row1 is turn9.\n\nBut what about moving down? That doesn't help because we are at row0 already.\n\nSo we must wait at row0 until turn8, then at turn8 we move up to row1 at turn9.\n\nThen we move up one row per turn: that is 8 moves from row1 to row9 -> 8 actions. Plus the two waits at row0: total 10 actions? \n\nWait: from row0 at turn8: then we move up at turn8 to row1 at turn9 -> that's one action (at turn8). Then we need 8 more moves to go from row1 to row9 (row1->row2->...->row9: 8 steps). So total 1 (for the first up) + 8 = 9 actions? But we also had two actions at turn6 and turn7: we did D or S at turn6 and turn7. So total actions: 2 (for turns6,7) + 1 (turn8: U) + 8 (turns9 to16: U) = 11 actions? \n\nBut we can do:\n\n   turn6: S -> stay at row0 -> turn7: row0\n   turn7: S -> stay at row0 -> turn8: row0\n   turn8: U -> to row1 at turn9\n   turn9: U -> row2 at turn10\n   turn10: U -> row3 at turn11\n   turn11: U -> row4 at turn12\n   turn12: U -> row5 at turn13\n   turn13: U -> row6 at turn14\n   turn14: U -> row7 at turn15\n   turn15: U -> row8 at turn16\n   turn16: U -> row9 at turn17\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nBut note: at turn13: we are at row5 at turn13? freeway5 is unsafe only at turn9 -> so safe.\n\nAt turn14: we are at row6 -> safe.\n\nAt turn15: row7 -> safe.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway3 and freeway4 at turn14 and 15? They are unsafe at T=14,15. But we are not on row3 or row4 at those turns. At turn14 we are at row6, at turn15 we are at row7.\n\nSo that path is safe.\n\nBut can we get to row9 earlier?\n\nWe started at row0 at turn6. We cannot be at row1 until turn9. Then we move one row per turn: so we get to row9 at turn17 (beginning of turn17). \n\nTotal turns: 11 actions (from turn6 to turn16) and we are at row9 at turn17.\n\nIs there a way to skip some rows? We move one row per turn, so we cannot skip.\n\nAlternatively, we could move faster? But we can only move one row per turn.\n\nOr we could take a detour? But moving down doesn't help because we are at row0.\n\nBut what if we move to row0 at turn6, then at turn7 we move down? but we are at row0, so down remains at row0. So same as staying.\n\nSo we must wait until turn8 to move up to row1 at turn9.\n\nBut then we move up every turn: 8 moves to go from row1 to row9 -> 8 turns, so we arrive at row9 at turn17.\n\nBut let me check if we can move two rows in one turn? No, because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut wait: we could move to row1 at turn9, then at turn9 we are at row1. Then at turn9 we can only move to row2 at turn10. \n\nBut what if we move faster? We cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid waiting the full two turns? But we cannot be at row1 at turn7 or turn8. So we must wait until turn9 to be at row1.\n\nBut we started at turn6. We are at row0 at turn6, and we can move up at turn6? to row1 at turn7? but then at turn7 we are at row1 -> unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me see if we can get to row9 earlier by taking a different route? For example, going to row2 at turn10, then we have to go through row3,4,5,6,7,8,9: that's 7 more moves -> turn16: then we are at row9 at turn17? same as above.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at row0 for only one turn? But if we move up at turn7, we get to row1 at turn8 -> unsafe (freeway1 at turn8 unsafe). So we cannot.\n\nSo we must have two turns at row0 (turn6 and turn7) and then move up at turn8 to row1 at turn9.\n\nThen we have 8 moves to row9: so total turns: from turn8 to turn16: 9 actions? plus the two at turn6 and turn7: total 11.\n\nBut the actions: \n   turn6: S (or D, but D also stays at 0)\n   turn7: S\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: U\n   turn15: U\n   turn16: U\n\nThat is 11 actions.\n\nWe are at row9 at the beginning of turn17.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions from turn6 to turn6+H-1. So H=11, so we output actions for turns 6,7,...,16.\n\nNow, what about freeway5 at turn9? We are not on freeway5 at turn9, we are on freeway1 at turn9 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? For example, after row1 at turn9, we go to row2 at turn10, row3 at turn11, row4 at turn12, and then at turn12 we are at row4. Then we go to row5 at turn13: safe. Then we can go to row6 at turn14, row7 at turn15, row8 at turn16, row9 at turn17. Same.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to go to row5 at an earlier turn? But we cannot because we are limited by the initial wait.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go to row0 for only one turn? Then at turn7 we are at row0. Then at turn7 we move to row1? no, because at turn8 we would be at row1 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid row1 at turn8.\n\nBut we can be at row1 at turn9.\n\nSo the earliest arrival at row1 is turn9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me check if we can get to row9 earlier by using rows that are safe earlier? \n\nFor example, we could go from row0 to row2 at turn9? But to get to row2 at turn9, we would have to:\n\n   at turn6: start at row0.\n   turn6: move U to row1 at turn7 -> unsafe (turn7: row1 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, at turn6: stay at row0.\n   turn7: move U to row1 at turn8 -> unsafe (row1 at turn8) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot get to row1 until turn9, and then row2 at turn10.\n\nSo we cannot jump.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have to output the sequence. We can choose either D or S for the first two actions? But we choose S for simplicity.\n\nSo:\n\n   Turn 6: S\n   Turn 7: S\n   Turn 8: U\n   Turn 9: U\n   Turn10: U\n   Turn11: U\n   Turn12: U\n   Turn13: U\n   Turn14: U\n   Turn15: U\n   Turn16: U\n\nBut we are at row9 at the beginning of turn17.\n\nWe must ensure that during the moves, we are safe.\n\nAt turn6: we are at row0 -> safe. Action S: so we remain at row0 at turn7.\nAt turn7: we are at row0 -> safe. Action S: remain at row0 at turn8.\nAt turn8: we are at row0 -> safe. Action U: move to row1 at turn9.\nAt turn9: we are at row1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at T=9). Action U: move to row2 at turn10.\nAt turn10: row2 -> safe (freeway2 safe at T=10). U to row3 at turn11.\nAt turn11: row3 -> safe (freeway3 safe at T=11). U to row4 at turn12.\nAt turn12: row4 -> safe (freeway4 safe at T=12). U to row5 at turn13.\nAt turn13: row5 -> safe (freeway5 safe at T=13). U to row6 at turn14.\nAt turn14: row6 -> safe (freeway6 always safe). U to row7 at turn15.\nAt turn15: row7 -> safe (freeway7 always safe). U to row8 at turn16.\nAt turn16: row8 -> safe (freeway8 always safe). U to row9 at turn17.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut note: at turn9, freeway5 is unsafe? But we are not on freeway5 at turn9, we are on freeway1 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Here H=11.\n\nBut is there a path with H=10? \n\nSuppose we start at turn6 at row0. We must be at row9 at turn16 (because after 10 actions, we are at turn16). \n\nWe need to go from row0 to row9: 9 steps. So we must move up every turn? \n\nBut we cannot move up at turn6: because that would put us at row1 at turn7 -> unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot move up at turn7: that would put us at row1 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must have at least two turns where we do not move up? \n\nIn 10 actions, we must have 9 moves up and 1 move that is not up? But if we do 9 moves up and 1 stay, then we would be at row9? \n\nBut the moves: \n   We start at row0 at turn6.\n   After 10 actions (at turn16), we are at row = 0 + (number of U) - (number of D) + (number of S that don't change) \n   Since we want row9, we need at least 9 U moves. And we have 10 moves: so we can have 9 U and 1 S (or 1 D, but D would reduce the row).\n\nSo we can do 9 U and 1 S. But the problem: we must avoid the unsafe rows at the unsafe turns.\n\nWe have to have two turns at row0? But we have 10 moves: we start at row0 at turn6. Then:\n\n   turn6: if we do S, then turn7: row0.\n   turn7: if we do S, then turn8: row0.\n   then we need 9 U moves: but that would be 9 moves: turn8 to turn16: 9 moves -> row9 at turn17.\n\nBut we only have 10 moves: from turn6 to turn15? Then we would be at row9 at turn16? \n\nHow? \n\n   We need to make 9 upward moves and one non-up move. \n\n   Suppose we do:\n\n        turn6: U -> not allowed (because leads to row1 at turn7 -> unsafe) -> invalid.\n\n   Or:\n\n        turn6: S -> row0 at turn7.\n        turn7: U -> leads to row1 at turn8 -> unsafe -> invalid.\n\n   Or:\n\n        turn6: S -> row0 at turn7.\n        turn7: S -> row0 at turn8.\n        turn8: U -> row1 at turn9.\n        turn9: U -> row2 at turn10.\n        turn10: U -> row3 at turn11.\n        turn11: U -> row4 at turn12.\n        turn12: U -> row5 at turn13.\n        turn13: U -> row6 at turn14.\n        turn14: U -> row7 at turn15.\n        turn15: U -> row8 at turn16.\n\n        Then we are at row8 at turn16 -> not row9.\n\n   To get to row9, we need one more U. But we have used 10 actions? \n\n        Actions: turn6:S, turn7:S, turn8:U, turn9:U, turn10:U, turn11:U, turn12:U, turn13:U, turn14:U, turn15:U -> 10 actions.\n\n        Then at turn16 we are at row8.\n\n        We need to do U at turn16 to get to row9 at turn17.\n\n   But that is 11 actions.\n\n   Alternatively, we skip one of the waits? But we cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut we can also do D for the first two? But D at row0: we remain at row0. So same as S.\n\nBut the problem does not specify a preference, so we can choose S.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut note: the action at turn16 is U, and then at the beginning of turn17 we are at row9.\n\nThis matches.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". And we are at (0,9) at turn17.\n\nAnd we have 11 actions.\n\nBut the answer format: we output from turn6 to turn16.\n\nSo that's 11 lines.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeways at the turns we are on them:\n\n   Turn6: row0 -> safe.\n   Turn7: row0 -> safe.\n   Turn8: row0 -> safe.\n   Turn9: row1 -> freeway1 at turn9: safe? (unsafe at 6,7,8,15,16,17 -> 9 not in) -> safe.\n   Turn10: row2 -> freeway2 at turn10: safe? same as freeway1: safe.\n   Turn11: row3 -> freeway3: unsafe at 7,8,14,15 -> 11 safe.\n   Turn12: row4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3: safe.\n   Turn13: row5 -> freeway5: unsafe at 9 -> 13 safe.\n   Turn14: row6 -> freeway6: always safe.\n   Turn15: row7 -> freeway7: always safe.\n   Turn16: row8 -> freeway8: always safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo we are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when a car occupies the x-position 0 at that turn.\n\n- At turns 6 and 7, staying (S) at row 0 is safe since row 0 has no cars.\n- Moving up (U) at turn 8 positions the player at row 1 at turn 9, which is safe because freeway 1 is unsafe only at turns 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, and 17.\n- From turns 9 to 16, moving up (U) each turn advances the player one row per turn. The freeways are checked for safety at each corresponding turn:\n  - Turn 9 (row 1): freeway 1 safe (unsafe at 6,7,8,15,16,17).\n  - Turn 10 (row 2): freeway 2 safe (same as freeway 1).\n  - Turn 11 (row 3): freeway 3 safe (unsafe at 7,8,14,15).\n  - Turn 12 (row 4): freeway 4 safe (same as freeway 3).\n  - Turn 13 (row 5): freeway 5 safe (unsafe only at turn 9).\n  - Turn 14 (row 6): freeway 6 always safe.\n  - Turn 15 (row 7): freeway 7 always safe.\n  - Turn 16 (row 8): freeway 8 always safe.\n- After the action at turn 16, the player reaches row 9 at turn 17, which is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car that covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars seem to be moving right, based on the direction given. For example, freeway 1 has cars with direction \"right\", and similarly for others.\n\nThe car update: for a right-moving car, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] where at t1 it was [τ, h]. In the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail. Let me check the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars (-32, -43, right, 4), (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4)\n\n(-32, -43): if head is -32 and tail is -43, since it's moving right, head should be to the right, so -32 > -43, yes. Similarly, (4, -7): 4 > -7, and (40,29): 40>29.\n\nBut for (4, -7), tail is -7, head is 4, so the span is from -7 to 4, which is length 11? Speed is 4, but let's not worry about that now.\n\nThe key point is that at any turn T, for a car on freeway i, if I am on that freeway at turn T, I collide if 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I move to a new row, I am not on that new row until the next turn. Specifically: at turn T, I am at position (0, y_T). Then I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. So at turn T, I am on row y_T, and I might collide with cars on row y_T if 0 in span at T.\n\nAfter moving, at turn T+1, I am on row y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nThe collision check is only when I am on the row at that turn.\n\nAlso, the vertical movement: I can go up (U, y+1), down (D, y-1), or stay (S, y same). y is between 0 and 9, so at y=0, I can't go down, similarly at y=9, can't go up, but since we start at 0 and go to 9, probably no down moves needed.\n\nStart at (0,0), target (0,9). Freeways are from y=1 to 8, so rows 1-8 have cars, row 0 and 9 are safe, I assume, no cars mentioned.\n\nRow 0 is the start, no cars, row 9 is target, no cars, so only when on rows 1-8 might there be collisions.\n\nNow, t1 is given as 7, but in the current turn, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", and in the state, \"Current Turn: t0 = 7\", let me check.\n\nIt says: \"Current Turn: t0 = 7\" and \"Player Position: (0, 0)\"\n\nBut in the task, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", and \"Answer for turn t1: a_{t1}\", etc.\n\nI think t0 is t1, so current turn is t=7.\n\nIn the answer format, it should start from turn t1.\n\nNow, I need to find actions from t=7 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at time t=7.\n\nSince the car positions are given at t=7, I think.\n\nThe car state is given for turn t1=7.\n\nSo for each freeway, the cars' head, tail, direction, speed at t=7.\n\nThen at turn T, the span changes.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, speed s.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time T, position: head_T = head_{t1} + s*(T - t1)\n\nSimilarly, tail_T = tail_{t1} + s*(T - t1)\n\nAnd span is [tail_T, head_T] since moving right.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] where (h, τ) at t1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, collision if y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in [tail_T, head_T].\n\nSince the player is at x=0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, but since we start at 0 and go to 9, and rows 1-8 are dangerous, I probably need to move up most of the time.\n\nThe minimal number of turns should be at least 9, since I need to increase y by 9, and each up move increases by 1, but I can stay or go down, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, I should always go up when possible, but I might need to avoid collisions by staying or even going down, but that might cost more turns, so for minimal H, I should avoid unnecessary moves and go up as much as possible, only deviating if necessary for collision avoidance.\n\nSince going down or staying increases H, for minimal H, I should only use U and S, never D, because D would require an extra U later to compensate, increasing H.\n\nStart at y=0, target y=9, so net change +9. Each U is +1, S is 0, D is -1. To minimize the number of actions, I should maximize the number of U moves, and minimize S and D. But since D reduces y, it would require an extra U, so it increases the total actions. Similarly, S doesn't change, so it increases H without progress. Therefore, for minimal H, I should never use D or S; only U, whenever possible. But I might be forced to S or even D to avoid a collision, but that would increase H, so in the optimal path, I should only U when safe, but if not safe, I might need to S or D, but since that increases H, I need to choose a path where I can U as much as possible without colliding.\n\nThe minimal possible H is 9, if I can go up every turn from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves: from t=7 to t=15, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut at each step, when I am on a row y, at that turn, I need that no car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nSince I start at t=7, y=0, which is safe, no cars.\n\nThen at t=7, I choose action a_7, which determines y_8.\n\nAfter action a_7, y_{8} is set, and at turn t=8, I will be on y_8, and so on.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI choose action a_t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t when I am on row y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and for the cars on that row, if 0 is in the span at time t.\n\nFor row y_t at time t.\n\nNow, at t=7, I am at (0,0), which is row 0, safe. I need to choose a_7.\n\na_7 can be U, D, or S. But y=0, if I choose D, y_{8} = 0-1 = -1, but y must be in [0,9], so I think y is clamped, but the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} should still be 0? Let's check.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9].\n\nIt says: y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy = -1, but y_{t+1} = 0 + (-1) = -1, which is not in [0,9], so it should be clamped to 0? But it doesn't specify clamping, it just says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so probably it is set to min(max(y_t + Δy, 0), 9).\n\nSimilarly for y=9 and U.\n\nSo for y=0, a_t=D would set y_{t+1} = 0, I think. Similarly, a_t=S sets y_{t+1}=0, a_t=U sets y_{t+1}=1.\n\nSimilarly for y=9.\n\nBut in this case, since we start at 0 and go to 9, and to minimize H, we should not choose D at y=0, as it does nothing but waste a turn.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nFor minimal H, we should only choose U or S, but S also wastes a turn.\n\nSo ideally, always choose U when possible.\n\nBut at y=0, a_t=U: y_{t+1} =1\n\na_t=S: y_{t+1}=0\n\na_t=D: y_{t+1}=0\n\nSo only U makes progress.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U or S would keep y=9, but since we want to reach (0,9), once there, we can stop, but in the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence is until turn t1+H-1 with y=9.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, y_T=9, then we are done, H is the number of actions from t1 to T, so T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nActions from t= t1 to t1+H-1, H actions.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nI need to find for each turn, from t=7 onwards, what y I am on, and ensure that when I am on y between 1 and 8, at that turn, no car on that row has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe cars are moving, so their positions change with time.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k=1 to 8, the cars at time t=7.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\nCar 1: h=-32, τ=-43, d=right, s=4\n\nAt time t, span: tail_t = τ + s(t-7) = -43 + 4(t-7)\n\nHead_t = -32 + 4(t-7)\n\nSimilarly, car 2: h=4, τ=-7, s=4, so tail_t = -7 + 4(t-7), head_t = 4 + 4(t-7)\n\nCar 3: h=40, τ=29, s=4, tail_t=29 + 4(t-7), head_t=40 + 4(t-7)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 2 has the same cars as freeway 1? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 2: cars (-32, -43, right, 4), (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4) — same as freeway 1.\n\nBut different freeway, so for row 2, these cars are on row 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (-42, -53, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (-42, -53, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6) — yes, same.\n\nFreeway 5: (-24, -35, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (60, 49, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 7: (48, 25, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 8: (48, 25, right, 24) — same as 7.\n\nSo freeways 1 and 2 have identical cars, 3 and 4 identical, 7 and 8 identical, 5 has its own, 6 has one car.\n\nNow, for each row and each time, I need to see if position 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for row k at time t, is 0 in any car's span on that row.\n\nIf not, then it is safe to be on that row at time t.\n\nSince we want to go up, let's find for each row and time whether it is safe.\n\nFirst, let's define the time from t=7 onwards.\n\nLet τ = t - 7, so at τ=0, t=7.\n\nThen for each car, at time τ (relative), the span.\n\nFor freeway 1 (and 2, but we'll do per row).\n\nRow 1:\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: τ_t1 = -43, h_t1 = -32, s=4\n\nAt τ, tail = -43 + 4τ, head = -32 + 4τ\n\n0 in span if tail <= 0 <= head, so -43 +4τ <= 0 and 0 <= -32 +4τ\n\n-43 +4τ <=0 => 4τ <=43 => τ <= 10.75\n\n0 <= -32 +4τ => 4τ >=32 => τ >=8\n\nSo for τ between 8 and 10 inclusive? τ integer, turns are discrete.\n\nτ >=8 and τ <=10.75, so τ=8,9,10\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ_t1=-7, h_t1=4, s=4\n\nTail = -7 +4τ, head=4+4τ\n\n0 in span: -7+4τ <=0 and 0<=4+4τ\n\n-7+4τ <=0 => 4τ<=7 => τ<=1.75\n\n0<=4+4τ always true for τ>=0\n\nSo only need -7+4τ <=0, τ<=1.75, so for τ=0,1? τ=0: tail=-7, head=4, 0 in [-7,4], yes. τ=1: tail=-3, head=8, 0 in, yes. τ=2: tail=1, head=12, 0 not <= tail=1, so 0 not in [1,12], no. τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nτ<=1.75, so τ=0,1.\n\nBut at τ=0, t=7, we are not on row 1 yet, we are on row 0.\n\nNow car C: h=40, τ=29, s=4, tail=29+4τ, head=40+4τ, both positive for τ>=0, so 0 not in [29+4τ,40+4τ] since min is 29>0, so never.\n\nSo for row 1, unsafe when car A or B has 0 in span.\n\nCar B: unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, but τ=0 is t=7, we are at row 0.\n\nCar A: unsafe at τ=8,9,10\n\nSo for row 1 at time τ, unsafe if:\n\nAt τ=0: car B unsafe, but τ=0 not relevant for being on row.\n\nFor being on row at time t, which is τ = t-7.\n\nAt time t, if we are on row 1, it is unsafe if at that τ, 0 in some car span.\n\nCar B unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, i.e., t=7 and t=8.\n\nBut at t=7, if we are on row 1, but at t=7, we start on row 0, so when would we be on row 1 at t=7? Only if we moved before, but at t=7, we are at (0,0), so y_7=0.\n\nThen at t=7, we choose action, which sets y_8.\n\nAt t=8, we are on y_8.\n\nSimilarly, collision at t if on row y_t at time t.\n\nSo for row 1:\n\nAt time t, τ=t-7\n\nUnsafe if:\n\n- Car B: τ=0 or 1, i.e., t=7 or 8? t=7: τ=0, t=8:τ=1\n\nBut at t=7, if we were on row 1, but we are not, y_7=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, if we are on row 1, it is unsafe because of car B.\n\nCar B at τ=1, t=8, tail= -7 +4*1 = -3, head=4+4=8, span [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nSimilarly, car A unsafe at τ=8,9,10, t=15,16,17? τ=8: t=7+8=15, τ=9:t=16, τ=10:t=17\n\nτ=8: t=15, etc.\n\nCar C never unsafe.\n\nSo row 1 unsafe at times:\n\n- t=8: because of car B\n\n- t=15: car A\n\n- t=16: car A\n\n- t=17: car A\n\nFor t=8, τ=1, car B unsafe.\n\nt=15, τ=8, car A: tail= -43+4*8= -43+32= -11, head=-32+32=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=16, τ=9, tail=-43+36=-7, head=-32+36=4, span [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=17, τ=10, tail=-43+40=-3, head=-32+40=8, span [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=18, τ=11, tail=-43+44=1, head=-32+44=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo row 1 unsafe at t=8,15,16,17.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nNow row 2: same cars as row 1, so same unsafe times: t=8,15,16,17.\n\nNow row 3: freeway 3\n\nCars: (-42, -53, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nCar D: τ_t1=-53, h_t1=-42, s=6\n\nAt τ, tail= -53 +6τ, head= -42 +6τ\n\n0 in span: -53+6τ <=0 and 0<= -42+6τ\n\n-53+6τ <=0 => 6τ<=53 => τ<=53/6≈8.833\n\n0<= -42+6τ => 6τ>=42 => τ>=7\n\nSo τ=7,8\n\nτ=7: tail=-53+42= -11? -53+6*7= -53+42= -11, head=-42+42=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=8: tail=-53+48= -5, head=-42+48=6, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=9: tail=-53+54=1, head=-42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar E: h=36, τ=25, s=6, tail=25+6τ, head=36+6τ, both >0, never 0 in.\n\nCar F: h=0, τ=-11, s=6, tail= -11 +6τ, head=0 +6τ\n\n0 in span: tail <=0 <= head\n\n-11+6τ <=0 and 0<=6τ\n\n0<=6τ always for τ>=0\n\n-11+6τ <=0 => 6τ<=11 => τ<=11/6≈1.833\n\nSo τ=0,1\n\nτ=0: tail=-11, head=0, span [-11,0], 0 in? Head=0, so 0 is included if it's closed interval.\n\nThe span [τ, h] for right-moving, and collision if 0 in span, so if closed interval, 0 included if τ <=0<=h.\n\nAt τ=0, t=7, tail=-11, head=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 <= head=0, yes, 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1: tail=-11+6= -5, head=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=2: tail=1, head=12, not.\n\nSo car F unsafe at τ=0 and 1, t=7 and 8.\n\nNow for row 3 at time t, unsafe if any car unsafe.\n\nCar F unsafe at t=7,8\n\nCar D unsafe at t=7+7=14? τ=7, t=14; τ=8,t=15\n\nt=7: τ=0\n\nt=14: τ=7\n\nt=15: τ=8\n\nCar E never.\n\nSo unsafe times for row 3: from car F: t=7,8; from car D: t=14,15\n\nt=7: unsafe, t=8 unsafe, t=14 unsafe, t=15 unsafe.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 same as row 3, so unsafe at t=7,8,14,15.\n\nNow row 5: freeway 5\n\nCars: (-24, -35, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nCar G: τ_t1=-35, h_t1=-24, s=12\n\nAt τ, tail= -35 +12τ, head= -24 +12τ\n\n0 in: -35+12τ <=0 and 0<= -24+12τ\n\n-35+12τ <=0 => 12τ<=35 => τ<=35/12≈2.916\n\n0<= -24+12τ => 12τ>=24 => τ>=2\n\nSo τ=2, since τ integer.\n\nτ=2: tail=-35+24= -11, head=-24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=3: tail=-35+36=1, head=-24+36=12, [1,12], not\n\nCar H: h=60, τ=49, s=12, tail=49+12τ, head=60+12τ, min 49>0, never 0 in.\n\nCar I: h=24, τ=13, s=12, tail=13+12τ, head=24+12τ, min 13>0, never.\n\nSo only car G at τ=2, t=7+2=9\n\nAt t=9, row 5 unsafe.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow row 6: freeway 6, only one car: (60, 49, right, 3)\n\nh=60, τ=49, s=3\n\nTail=49+3τ, head=60+3τ, min 49>0, so never 0 in span. Always safe? But head and tail both positive, so 0 not in [49+3τ,60+3τ] for any τ.\n\nSo row 6 always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt τ=0, tail=49, head=60, [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nFor any τ, tail=49+3τ >=49>0, so 0 not in span. Yes, so row 6 is always safe at all times.\n\nNow row 7: freeway 7, car: (48, 25, right, 24)\n\nh=48, τ=25, s=24\n\nAt τ, tail=25+24τ, head=48+24τ, min 25>0, so never 0 in span. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8: same car, always safe.\n\nBut row 8 is freeway 8, same as row 7? Freeway 8 has same car, so also always safe.\n\nNow, summary of unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: unsafe at t=8,15,16,17\n\n- Row 2: same, unsafe at t=8,15,16,17\n\n- Row 3: unsafe at t=7,8,14,15\n\n- Row 4: same, unsafe at t=7,8,14,15\n\n- Row 5: unsafe at t=9\n\n- Row 6: always safe\n\n- Row 7: always safe\n\n- Row 8: always safe\n\nWe start at t=7, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nIdeal: from t=7 to t=15, in 8 moves? t=7 to t=15 is 8 turns later? Let's see.\n\nAt t=7, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_7, at t=8, y_8.\n\nAfter a_8, t=9, y_9, and so on, up to t=7 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if we go up every turn, from t=7 to t=15: at t=7, y=0; a_7=U, y_8=1; a_8=U, y_9=2; ... up to a_14=U, y_15=8; then a_15=U, y_16=9. So at t=16, y=9. H=9 actions? Turns: t=7 to t=15 inclusive is 9 turns? Let's index.\n\nStart: turn t=7, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=7 + H, we have y_{7+H}.\n\nWe need y_{7+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t=7+H, position y_{7+H}.\n\nSet y_{7+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H=9, if we can go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, each up, so from t=7 to t=15, y from 0 to 9? t=7: y=0, after a_7: t=8, y=1; a_8: t=9, y=2; ... a_14: t=15, y=8; a_15: t=16, y=9. So at t=16, y=9. So H=10 actions? Turns involved: actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15: that's 9 actions, from t=7 to t=15, and after last action at t=15, at t=16, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H: from t=7 to t=7+H-1, so after H actions, turn is t=7+H.\n\nSet t=7+H, y=9.\n\nFor y to be 9 at turn T, with T=7+H.\n\nMinimal T=16, if we go up every step, since from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up, each up move increases y by 1, start at t=7 y=0, after first U at t=7, y_8=1; ... after 9th U at t=15, y_16=9. So T=16, H=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so H=9, turns t=7 to t=15.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=7 to t=7+H-1 = t=7 to t=15.\n\nAt t=16, y=9, no action needed.\n\nNow, in this path, we need to be safe at each position when on rows 1-8.\n\nAt each turn t, when y_t is between 1 and 8, it must be safe.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nt=7: y=0, safe\n\na_7=U, so y_8=1\n\nt=8: on row 1? At turn t=8, y_8=1, so on row 1 at time t=8.\n\nBut row 1 is unsafe at t=8, as we saw earlier.\n\nConflict.\n\nSo at t=8, if y=1, collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot go directly to row 1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, let's list the times we need to be on each row if going up fast.\n\nBut we might need to delay or something.\n\nSince row 6,7,8 are always safe except row 5 unsafe at t=9, etc.\n\nWe need to plan the sequence.\n\nStart at t=7, y=0.\n\nWe need to choose a_7.\n\nOptions: U, S, D. But D at y=0 does nothing, y_8=0, waste. S same. So only U makes sense, but at t=8, if we go to y=1, it is unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=7, y_8=0, then at t=8, we are still on row 0, safe, but no progress.\n\nThen at t=8, we can choose action.\n\nBut we need to minimize H, so staying is bad.\n\nPerhaps go up later.\n\nSince row 1 is unsafe at t=8, but safe at other times except t=15,16,17.\n\nt=15,16,17 are late.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 unsafe at t=7,8,14,15.\n\nt=7 and 8 are early.\n\nNow, we are at t=7, y=0.\n\nIf we do U at t=7, we go to y_8=1 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=7, y_8=0, then at t=8, on row 0, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can go U to y_9=1, but at t=9, on row 1? Let's see.\n\nAt t=8, if we are on y_8=0, choose a_8=U, then y_9=1.\n\nThen at turn t=9, we are on y_9=1.\n\nNow, row 1 at t=9: is it safe?\n\nFrom earlier, row 1 unsafe only at t=8,15,16,17.\n\nt=9 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we can continue up.\n\nBut we wasted one turn staying at t=7.\n\nSo H would be 10 instead of 9.\n\nMinimal H=9 might not be possible? Let's see if we can do H=9.\n\nWith H=9, we need to be at y=9 at t=16.\n\ny_t at each turn:\n\nt=7: y=0\n\nt=8: y must be set, between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we start from y=0, and after 9 actions, y=9, so we must have exactly 9 up moves, no S or D, because any S or D would require an extra U to compensate, increasing H beyond 9.\n\nFor example, if we do one S, then to reach y=9, we need 10 U, so H=10.\n\nSimilarly, if D, even worse.\n\nSo for H=9, we must do U every turn from t=7 to t=15.\n\nThus, y_t = t - 7 for t from 7 to 16? Let's list:\n\nAt t=7, y=0\n\nAfter a_7=U, t=8, y=1\n\na_8=U, t=9, y=2\n\na_9=U, t=10, y=3\n\na_10=U, t=11, y=4\n\na_11=U, t=12, y=5\n\na_12=U, t=13, y=6\n\na_13=U, t=14, y=7\n\na_14=U, t=15, y=8\n\na_15=U, t=16, y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, when on row 1-8:\n\nt=8: y=1, row 1 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nt=9: y=2, row 2 at t=9. Row 2 unsafe at t=8,15,16,17. t=9 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nt=10: y=3, row 3 at t=10. Row 3 unsafe at t=7,8,14,15. t=10 not, safe.\n\nt=11: y=4, row 4 at t=11. Row 4 same as row 3, unsafe at t=7,8,14,15, so t=11 safe.\n\nt=12: y=5, row 5 at t=12. Row 5 unsafe only at t=9. t=12 safe.\n\nt=13: y=6, row 6 at t=13. Row 6 always safe, ok.\n\nt=14: y=7, row 7 at t=14. Row 7 always safe, ok.\n\nt=15: y=8, row 8 at t=15. Row 8 always safe, ok.\n\nt=16: y=9, safe.\n\nBut problem at t=8, y=1, row 1 unsafe.\n\nIf we can avoid being on row 1 at t=8.\n\nBut in this sequence, we are forced to be on row 1 at t=8 if we go directly.\n\nPerhaps we can go up but skip row 1 at t=8 by staying or something, but with only U moves, we must be on row 1 at t=8.\n\nUnless we start later, but we start at t=7.\n\nAnother idea: go down at some point, but at y=0, we can't go down, and going down would require extra moves.\n\nFor example, if at t=7, we do S, then y_8=0, then at t=8, on row 0, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we do U, y_9=1, at t=9 on row 1, which is safe as row 1 safe at t=9.\n\nThen continue: a_9=U, y_10=2, at t=10 row 2 safe (since unsafe only at t=8,15,16,17)\n\na_10=U, y_11=3, t=11 row 3 safe (unsafe t=7,8,14,15)\n\na_11=U, y_12=4, t=12 row 4 safe (same as row 3)\n\na_12=U, y_13=5, t=13 row 5? Row 5 at t=13: unsafe only at t=9, so safe.\n\na_13=U, y_14=6, t=14 row 6 always safe\n\na_14=U, y_15=7, t=15 row 7 always safe\n\na_15=U, y_16=8, t=16 row 8 always safe\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, so at t=16, y=8, we do a_16=U, y_17=9.\n\nBut now at t=17, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this case, actions from t=7 to t=16: 10 actions? t=7 to t=16 is 10 turns.\n\nStart t=7, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (t=7), at t=8, y_8\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=7+k, y_{7+k}\n\nSet y_{7+k} =9.\n\nIn the first scenario with all U, k=9, at t=16, y=9.\n\nIn this delayed start: at t=7, a_7=S, so after a_7, at t=8, y=0\n\nThen a_8=U, at t=9, y=1\n\na_9=U, t=10, y=2\n\n...\n\na_15=U, t=16, y=8\n\nThen a_16=U, t=17, y=9\n\nSo after 10 actions, at t=17, y=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut we can reach in 9 actions if we avoid the collision at t=8.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps we can go to row 2 directly or something, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: since row 6,7,8 are safe, we can go faster later, but we need to go through all rows.\n\nPerhaps at t=7, instead of going to y=1, we stay, but we did that.\n\nOr, we can go to y=1 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we go to row 1 at t=9 instead of t=8.\n\nBut to be on row 1 at t=9, we need to have y_9=1.\n\ny_9 depends on previous.\n\nAt t=7, y=0.\n\nIf we do S at t=7, y_8=0\n\nThen at t=8, we can do U, y_9=1, so at t=9, on row 1, which is safe, as before.\n\nBut that takes two turns to go from y=0 to y=1, whereas normally one.\n\nSo still H=10.\n\nIf we could be on row 1 at t=7, but we start at y=0, at t=7 we are on row 0, not row 1.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can skip row 1 and go to row 2 directly, but no, we can only move to adjacent rows.\n\nSo I think H=9 is impossible because we must be on row 1 at some point, and the only safe times for row 1 are t<8 or t>10 except t=15,16,17 which are late.\n\nt=9 and t=10 are safe for row 1.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 same.\n\nBut to be on row 1 at t=9, for example.\n\nBut we start at t=7 y=0.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=9.\n\ny_9=1.\n\nNow, y_9 depends on y_8 and a_8.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nIf y_9=1, then y_8 + Δy_8 =1\n\ny_8 could be 0,1,2.\n\nIf y_8=0, then a_8=U, Δy=+1\n\nIf y_8=1, then a_8=S or D, but D to y=0, then a_8=S or D would make y_9=1 or 0, not 1 if y_8=1.\n\nIf y_8=1, a_8=S, y_9=1; a_8=D, y_9=0; a_8=U, y_9=2.\n\nSo to have y_9=1, we need either y_8=0 and a_8=U, or y_8=1 and a_8=S, or y_8=2 and a_8=D.\n\nBut y_8=2 and a_8=D to y_9=1 is possible but inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, y=0.\n\nWe need to set y_8.\n\nIf we want y_9=1, one way is y_8=0 and a_8=U.\n\nThen at t=8, we are on row y_8=0, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=9, on row 1, safe.\n\nBut to have y_8=0, at t=7, we can do S or D, but y=0, S or D both give y_8=0.\n\na_7=S: y_8=0\n\nOr a_7=D: y_8=0, same.\n\nThen a_8=U: y_9=1.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut as before, we have an extra turn.\n\nIf we do a_7=U, y_8=1, but then at t=8 on row 1, unsafe, collision, not allowed.\n\nSo we must not be on row 1 at t=8.\n\nTherefore, for H=9, it is impossible because we must pass row 1 at t=8 in the direct path, which is unsafe.\n\nAny other path with H=9 must have exactly 9 U moves, so y increases from 0 to 9 in 9 steps, so y_t = t - 7 for t from 8 to 16? y at turn t:\n\nt=7: 0\n\nt=8:1 if U\n\nt=9:2, ..., up to t=16:9\n\nSo y_t = t - 7 for t=8 to 16.\n\nAt t=8, y=1 must be safe, but it is not.\n\nHence impossible with H=9.\n\nMinimal H is 10.\n\nNow with H=10, we can reach at t=17 y=9.\n\nNow, we need a sequence with 10 actions.\n\nWe can start by staying or delaying.\n\nBut we might be able to go faster on some parts.\n\nSince rows 6,7,8 are always safe, we can go through them quickly.\n\nBut we need to handle the early rows.\n\nList the unsafe times again.\n\nWe need to be on row 1 at a safe time: safe except t=8,15,16,17. So safe for t=9,10,11,12,13,14, etc.\n\nSimilarly row 2 same.\n\nRow 3 safe except t=7,8,14,15, so safe for t=9,10,11,12,13,16,... but t=16 might be used later.\n\nSimilarly row 4 same.\n\nRow 5 unsafe only at t=9, so safe for other t.\n\nRow 6 always safe.\n\nRow 7 always safe.\n\nRow 8 always safe.\n\nNow, we can plan the path.\n\nStart at t=7, y=0.\n\nWe need to choose a_7.\n\nIf we do U, we go to y=1 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nSo we must not do U at t=7.\n\nThus, a_7 must be S or D, both give y_8=0.\n\nSay a_7=S, y_8=0.\n\nThen at t=8, on row 0, safe.\n\nNow at t=8, we choose a_8.\n\nWe can do U to go to y_9=1.\n\nThen at t=9, on row 1, which is safe (since row 1 safe at t=9).\n\nNow from here, we can go up.\n\nBut at t=9, y=1.\n\nIf we do U, y_10=2, at t=10 on row 2, safe.\n\nU, y_11=3, t=11 row 3: row 3 safe at t=11? Yes, unsafe only t=7,8,14,15.\n\nt=11 safe.\n\nThen U, y_12=4, t=12 row 4, same, safe.\n\nU, y_13=5, t=13 row 5: row 5 unsafe only at t=9, so t=13 safe.\n\nU, y_14=6, t=14 row 6, always safe.\n\nBut row 6 at t=14.\n\nNow, row 3 is unsafe at t=14? Row 3 at t=14 is unsafe, but we are on row 6 at t=14, not row 3.\n\nWe are on row y_t at time t.\n\nAt t=14, we are on row 6, which is safe.\n\nThen U, y_15=7, t=15 row 7, always safe.\n\nU, y_16=8, t=16 row 8, always safe.\n\nThen U, y_17=9.\n\nNow, we have actions from t=7 to t=16: 10 actions.\n\nt=7: S\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nAt t=17, y=9.\n\nIn this, we are on row 3 at t=11, which is safe, since row 3 unsafe only at t=7,8,14,15.\n\nt=11 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 at t=13, unsafe only at t=9, not t=13, safe.\n\nBut at t=14, we are on row 6, not row 3.\n\nNow, H=10.\n\nBut can we do better? H=10 is minimal since H=9 impossible.\n\nBut perhaps we can save a turn somewhere else.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 1 earlier or later.\n\nIn this sequence, we are on row 1 at t=9.\n\nWe could be on row 1 at t=10, but that might be later.\n\nFor instance, if at t=7, we do S, y_8=0\n\nThen at t=8, we do S, y_9=0\n\nThen a_8=S, y_9=0\n\nThen at t=9, on row 0, then a_9=U, y_10=1, at t=10 on row 1, safe.\n\nBut then we start later, so we reach later, H larger.\n\nFor example, at t=17, y=8 or something.\n\nWith a_9=U, y_10=1, then need to go to y=9, so up to t=16: a_16=U, y_17=9, but started with two S, so more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first sequence is better.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster on the upper rows.\n\nBut in the sequence above, from t=9 to t=16, we go from y=1 to y=8 in 7 turns? t=9 y=1, after a_9 to a_15: 7 actions to y=8 at t=16, then a_16 to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=8, 7 up moves, in 7 turns: from t=9 to t=15 actions, y from 1 to 8 at t=16.\n\nThen a_16 to y=9.\n\nBut we have the initial delay.\n\nSince row 5 is unsafe only at t=9, and in the sequence we are on row 5 at t=13, safe.\n\nBut if we can be on row 5 at t=9, but row 5 unsafe at t=9, so we cannot.\n\nIn fact, row 5 unsafe only at t=9, so we must avoid row 5 at t=9.\n\nIn our sequence, we are safe.\n\nAnother thing: row 3 and 4 unsafe at t=14 and 15, but we are on row 6 and 7 at that time, so fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t=14, we are on row 6, which is fine.\n\nBut row 3 is unsafe at t=14, but we are not on it.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can start by going up but skip the unsafe point.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if we could go directly to y=2, but we can't, only to y=1.\n\nSo I think H=10 is necessary and the sequence above works.\n\nBut let's confirm all positions.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=7: a_7 = S (so y_8=0)\n\nAt t=8, position: y=0, safe.\n\na_8 = U, so y_9=1\n\nAt t=9, position: y=1, row 1 at t=9. Safe? Row 1 unsafe at t=8,15,16,17. t=9 safe. Yes.\n\na_9 = U, y_10=2\n\nt=10, y=2, row 2 at t=10. Row 2 unsafe at t=8,15,16,17. t=10 safe. Yes.\n\na_10 = U, y_11=3\n\nt=11, y=3, row 3 at t=11. Row 3 unsafe at t=7,8,14,15. t=11 safe. Yes.\n\na_11 = U, y_12=4\n\nt=12, y=4, row 4 at t=12. Row 4 same as row 3, unsafe at t=7,8,14,15, t=12 safe. Yes.\n\na_12 = U, y_13=5\n\nt=13, y=5, row 5 at t=13. Row 5 unsafe only at t=9, t=13 safe. Yes.\n\na_13 = U, y_14=6\n\nt=14, y=6, row 6 at t=14. Row 6 always safe. Yes.\n\na_14 = U, y_15=7\n\nt=15, y=7, row 7 at t=15. Row 7 always safe. Yes.\n\na_15 = U, y_16=8\n\nt=16, y=8, row 8 at t=16. Row 8 always safe. Yes.\n\na_16 = U, y_17=9\n\nt=17, y=9, done.\n\nNow, actions from t=7 to t=16, 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions for turns starting from t_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_7: S\n\nTurn t_7 +1: U? Turn t_7 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t: a_t for t=7 to 16.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nWith t1=7, H=10, so actions for t=7 to t=7+9=16? t1 + H -1 =7 +10 -1=16.\n\nYes, turns 7 to 16.\n\nIn the sequence above, a_7=S, a_8=U, a_9=U, ..., a_16=U.\n\nBut in the sequence, a_7=S, then a_8 to a_16 all U, except a_7 is S.\n\nFrom a_8 to a_16, 9 actions, all U, but we have 10 actions including a_7.\n\na_7 to a_16: 10 actions.\n\nIn terms of the path, we could have done a_7=D, but same as S, y_8=0.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=10 but without the initial stay? For example, if we go down later, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=7, we do U, but then at t=8 we are on row 1 unsafe, not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nPerhaps go to row 1 at t=10, but then we need to have y lower earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=7, a_7=S, y_8=0\n\nt=8, a_8=S, y_9=0\n\nt=9, a_9=U, y_10=1, at t=10 on row 1 safe.\n\nThen from there, we go up, but we are slower: at t=10 y=1, then need to go to y=9, which takes 8 more U, so at t=18 y=9, H=11 actions from t=7 to t=17? Actions: t=7 to t=17 for 11 actions? Worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the sequence with one initial stay is best.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 5 at a different time, but it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the upper rows, since they are safe, we could go faster, but we are already going up every turn after the start.\n\nIn the sequence from t=8 onwards, we go up every turn, so it's optimal after the delay.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has only one car, which is always safe, and we are on it at t=14, fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=14, we are on row 6, but row 3 is unsafe at t=14, but we are not on row 3, so ok.\n\nNow, the action sequence:\n\nTurn t_7: S  (since t1=7)\n\nTurn t_7 +1: U  (t=8)\n\nTurn t_7 +2: U  (t=9)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_7 +9: U  (t=16)\n\nt_7 + H-1 = t_7 +9 =16\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's write the actions:\n\na_{t1} = a_7 = S\n\na_{t1+1} = a_8 = U\n\na_{t1+2} = a_9 = U\n\na_{t1+3} = a_10 = U\n\na_{t1+4} = a_11 = U\n\na_{t1+5} = a_12 = U\n\na_{t1+6} = a_13 = U\n\na_{t1+7} = a_14 = U\n\na_{t1+8} = a_15 = U\n\na_{t1+9} = a_16 = U\n\nIn terms of t, from t=7 to t=16.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut H=10.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce H by going down somewhere, but unlikely.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to row 2 quickly, but we have to go through row 1.\n\nAnother idea: since row 6 is always safe, and rows 7,8, but we need to pass lower rows.\n\nPerhaps we can stay on a row to avoid unsafe time.\n\nFor instance, row 3 unsafe at t=14,15, but if we are not on it, fine.\n\nIn our path, we are on row 3 at t=11, safe.\n\nSuppose we want to reach earlier, but H=9 impossible.\n\nPerhaps with H=10 but different sequence.\n\nFor example, at t=7, a_7=U, but then at t=8, if we could be not on row 1, but we must be if we go up.\n\nUnless we do D or S at t=7, but at y=0, D or S keep y=0.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 10, with the sequence: S at t=7, then U for t=8 to 16.\n\nBut t=8 to 16 is 9 actions, plus t=7, 10 actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need to write it clearly.\n\nNow, for the car on row 3, car F at t=7: head=0, tail=-11, so at t=7, span includes 0, but we are not on row 3 at t=7, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 9: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nIn the turn labels, it says \"Turn t_7\" etc., but in the format, it should be \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" but t1 is given as 7, so we can write t_7.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\", so since t1=7, it should be \"Turn t_7: S\" etc.\n\nSimilarly, \"Turn t_7 + 1: U\", up to \"Turn t_7 + 9: U\"\n\nNow, H=10.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can do with H=10 but without S, for example.\n\nSuppose at t=7, we do nothing, but must choose action.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=1 at t=10 or something, but later.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we go up to y=2 directly, but can't.\n\nAt t=7, a_7=U, but unsafe at t=8, not possible.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 10, as a path with \\(H = 9\\) is impossible due to a collision on row 1 at turn \\(t = 8\\) in the direct upward path.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions by staying at row 0 at turn \\(t = 7\\) (safe, as row 0 has no cars) and then moving upward each turn. This ensures that:\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\), the player is on row 0 (safe).\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), the player is on row 1, which is safe because row 1 is unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 15, 16, 17\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), the player is on row 2, which is safe because row 2 is unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 15, 16, 17\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\), the player is on row 3, which is safe because row 3 is unsafe only at \\(t = 7, 8, 14, 15\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\), the player is on row 4, which is safe because row 4 is unsafe only at \\(t = 7, 8, 14, 15\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 13\\), the player is on row 5, which is safe because row 5 is unsafe only at \\(t = 9\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 14\\), the player is on row 6, which is always safe.\n- At turn \\(t = 15\\), the player is on row 7, which is always safe.\n- At turn \\(t = 16\\), the player is on row 8, which is always safe.\n- After the action at turn \\(t = 16\\), the player reaches row 9 at turn \\(t = 17\\), which is safe.\n\nThe actions are chosen to minimize \\(H\\) while avoiding all unsafe states, resulting in \\(H = 10\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_7 + 9: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=8 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions and how they move over time.\n\nThe cars are given at turn t1=8. For each freeway k, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nDirection: \"right\" means moving to the right, so increasing x, I assume. The span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving cars, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] if head and tail are given, but in the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right-moving, head should be greater than tail I think, but let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-28, -39, right, 4), (8, -3, right, 4), (44, 33, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, with head > tail, I think.\n\nIn the first car, head=-28, tail=-39. Since -28 > -39, so head is greater, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-39, -28] at t1=8.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet me list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars:\n\nCar1: h=-28, τ=-39, d=right, s=4 → at t1=8, span [-39, -28]\n\nCar2: h=8, τ=-3, d=right, s=4 → τ=-3, h=8, so span [-3,8]? But τ=-3, h=8, so if right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [-3,8]\n\nBut -3 to 8, that includes 0? -3 to 8, yes, 0 is between -3 and 8.\n\nAt t1=8, for freeway 1, car2 has span [-3,8], which includes 0. So if player is on y=1 at turn 8, they would collide? But player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=8, so y=0, not on freeway, so no collision at start.\n\nPlayer position is given as (0, y_t1), so at turn t1, player is at (0, y_t1) = (0,0).\n\nNow, for collision, it happens only when player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that y, at that T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, no cars there. Player starts at y=0 and needs to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when 0 is covered by a car at each turn.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can find for each freeway and each time, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nBut time is discrete turns.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t1=8.\n\nSet τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn t1.\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at τ=H, so position (0,9) at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, player should be at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, where t is τ, the offset.\n\nDefine τ from 0.\n\nAt time τ (after t1), player position y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=H-1, and after H actions, at time τ=H, y_H should be 9.\n\nAt time τ, after τ actions, position is set.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter action a_0 (at turn t1), y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nGenerally, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nWith Δy_τ based on a_τ.\n\nAnd at some τ=H, y_H =9.\n\nWe need min H and the sequence a_τ for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn τ, if y_τ is between 1 and 8, then we check if for freeway y_τ, at time τ (since t = t1 + τ), x=0 is in some car's span.\n\nTime for cars: at turn T = t1 + τ.\n\nFor a car, at time τ, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] since T - t1 = τ, and span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [τ + sτ, h + sτ]\n\nτ is the tail at t1, s is speed.\n\nSimilarly for head.\n\nLet me denote for a car, at t1, tail τ, head h, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at time offset τ, span:\n\nIf d=right: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ]\n\nIf d=left: [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ]  (since left: span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], with ΔT = T - t1 = τ)\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nBut in the data, all cars are right-moving, I think.\n\nCheck the table:\n\nFreeway 1: all right\n\nFreeway 2: all right\n\nFreeway 3: all right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: all right\n\nFreeway 6: one car, right\n\nFreeway 7: one car, right\n\nFreeway 8: one car, right\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so only right-moving case.\n\nFor each car, at time offset τ, span is [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [τ(1+s), h + s τ] no.\n\nτ + s*τ? τ is tail, s is speed, τ is time offset.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use t for time offset.\n\nSet t as time offset from t1, t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt time offset t, turn number is t1 + t.\n\nFor a car with initial tail τ, initial head h, speed s, right-moving.\n\nAt time t, the position: the tail is at τ + s*t\n\nHead is at h + s*t\n\nSo span is [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nx=0 is occupied if min(τ + s t, h + s t) <= 0 <= max(τ + s t, h + s t)\n\nSince head and tail, for right-moving, h > τ usually, so τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t if the car covers 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so we need if any car covers x=0 at time t.\n\nFreeway k is safe at time t if no car on k has 0 in its span at time t.\n\nPlayer on freeway y at time t is safe if freeway y is safe at time t.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and find when x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: \n1. (h=-28, τ=-39, s=4) → at time t, span: [-39 + 4t, -28 + 4t]\n2. (h=8, τ=-3, s=4) → span: [-3 + 4t, 8 + 4t]\n3. (h=44, τ=33, s=4) → τ=33, h=44, so span [33 + 4t, 44 + 4t]\n\nNow, x=0 covered if for any car, the span includes 0.\n\nCar1: -39 +4t <= 0 <= -28 +4t\n\nSince -39+4t <= -28+4t always, so 0 <= -28 +4t and -39+4t <=0, so -39+4t <=0 and 0<= -28+4t, which is 4t <=39 and 4t >=28, so t>=7 and t<=9.75, so t=7,8,9 since t integer.\n\nt=7: -39+28= -11 <=0, -28+28=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so yes, covered at t=7.\n\nt=7: min=-39+28= -11, max=-28+28=0, so 0 is included.\n\nt=8: -39+32= -7 <=0, -28+32=4 >=0, yes.\n\nt=9: -39+36= -3 <=0, -28+36=8>=0, yes.\n\nt=10: -39+40=1 >0, not <=0, so min=1>0, not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, car2: span [-3+4t, 8+4t]\n\n-3+4t <=0 <=8+4t\n\n-3+4t <=0 implies 4t<=3, t<=0.75, so t<=0\n\n0<=8+4t always since 8+4t>0.\n\nSo -3+4t <=0 and 0<=8+4t\n\n-3+4t <=0 iff t<=0.75, so for t=0, -3+0= -3<=0, 8+0=8>=0, yes.\n\nt=1: -3+4=1>0, not <=0, so no.\n\nSo car2 covers 0 only at t=0? t=0: -3+0= -3 <=0 <=8, yes.\n\nt=1: min=1>0, no.\n\nt=0 only.\n\nBut at t=0, we are at turn t1, but player is at y=0, not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nCar3: [33+4t, 44+4t] always positive, min=33+4t >=33>0, so never cover 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, covered when:\n\n- car1: t=7,8,9\n\n- car2: t=0\n\n- car3: never\n\nSo overall, freeway 1 is unsafe at t=0,7,8,9\n\nt=0: car2 covers\n\nt=7,8,9: car1 covers\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2):\n\nCars: same as freeway 1? Look at table.\n\nFreeway 2: (-28,-39,right,4), (8,-3,right,4), (44,33,right,4) identical to freeway 1.\n\nSo same as above, unsafe at t=0,7,8,9\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3):\n\nCars: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\ns=6 for all.\n\nCar1: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6 → span [-47 +6t, -36 +6t]\n\nCover 0: -47+6t <=0 <= -36+6t\n\nSo -47+6t <=0 and 0<= -36+6t\n\n6t <=47 and 6t >=36, t<=47/6≈7.833, t>=6\n\nSo t=6,7\n\nt=6: -47+36= -11 <=0, -36+36=0 <=0, yes\n\nt=7: -47+42= -5 <=0, -36+42=6>=0, yes\n\nt=8: -47+48=1>0, not <=0, no\n\nCar2: h=42, τ=31, s=6 → span [31+6t,42+6t] min>31>0, never cover 0\n\nCar3: h=6, τ=-5, s=6 → span [-5+6t, 6+6t]\n\nCover 0: -5+6t <=0 <=6+6t\n\n-5+6t <=0 iff 6t<=5, t<=5/6≈0.833, so t<=0\n\n0<=6+6t always true\n\nSo at t=0: -5+0= -5<=0, 6+0=6>=0, yes\n\nt=1: min= -5+6=1>0, no\n\nSo only t=0\n\nOverall freeway 3 unsafe at t=0 (car3), t=6,7 (car1)\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4):\n\nCars same as freeway 3? Table: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6) same as y=3.\n\nSo unsafe at t=0,6,7\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5):\n\nCars: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\ns=12\n\nCar1: h=-12, τ=-23, s=12 → span [-23+12t, -12+12t]\n\nCover 0: -23+12t <=0 <= -12+12t\n\nSo -23+12t <=0 and 0<= -12+12t\n\n12t <=23 and 12t >=12, t<=23/12≈1.916, t>=1\n\nSo t=1,2? t=1: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0, yes\n\nt=2: -23+24=1>0? min=1>0, no? -23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, min=1>0, not cover 0.\n\nt=1: min=-23+12= -11 <=0, max= -12+12=0 <=0, so 0 included.\n\nt=2: min=-23+24=1>0, no.\n\nt>=2 min>0, t<=1 max<= -12+12=0 at t=1, at t=0: min=-23<0, max=-12<0, both negative, so 0 not in.\n\nAt t=1 only.\n\nCar2: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12 → span [-59+12t, -48+12t]\n\nCover 0: -59+12t <=0 <= -48+12t\n\n-59+12t <=0 and 0<= -48+12t\n\n12t <=59, t<=59/12≈4.916\n\n12t >=48, t>=4\n\nSo t=4,5? t=4: -59+48= -11 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0, yes\n\nt=5: -59+60=1>0, min=1>0, no\n\nSo t=4 only.\n\nCar3: h=36, τ=25, s=12 → span [25+12t,36+12t] min>25>0, never.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe at t=1 (car1), t=4 (car2)\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6):\n\nCars: only one, (-48,-59,right,3) s=3\n\nh=-48? Table says (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nτ=-59, h=-48, s=3\n\nSpan [-59 +3t, -48 +3t]\n\nCover 0: -59+3t <=0 <= -48+3t\n\n-59+3t <=0 and 0<= -48+3t\n\n3t <=59, t<=59/3≈19.666\n\n3t >=48, t>=16\n\nSo t=16,17,18,19? t=16: -59+48= -11 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0, yes\n\nt=17: -59+51= -8 <=0, -48+51=3>=0, yes\n\nt=18: -59+54= -5 <=0, -48+54=6>=0, yes\n\nt=19: -59+57= -2 <=0, -48+57=9>=0, yes\n\nt=20: -59+60=1>0, min=1>0, no\n\nSo unsafe for t=16 to 19.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7):\n\nCars: one car, (72,49,right,24) s=24\n\nh=72, τ=49, s=24\n\nSpan [49+24t, 72+24t] min=49+24t >=49>0, always positive, never covers 0. Safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8):\n\nCars: one car, (72,49,right,24) same as y=7? Table says (72,49,right,24) for both y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have identical car? But different freeways.\n\nSo for y=8, same as y=7, span [49+24t,72+24t] always min>0, never covers 0. Safe always.\n\nNow, summary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=0,7,8,9\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe at t=0,7,8,9\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=0,6,7\n\ny=4: same as y=3, unsafe at t=0,6,7\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=1,4\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=7: safe always\n\ny=8: safe always\n\nNote that at t=0, y=1 to 4 are unsafe, but player is at y=0 at t=0, not on freeway, so no problem. We care when player is on freeway.\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is safe.\n\nPlayer can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or move down, but that would increase H, so probably not useful except to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving down might be needed to wait, but since we want min H, we should go up directly unless blocked.\n\nNow, the unsafe times per row.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are always safe, we can be there anytime.\n\ny=6 is unsafe only at t=16-19, which is late, so probably not an issue if we go fast.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\ny=1-4 have unsafe times early.\n\nNow, player at t=0, y=0.\n\nAction at t=0: can go U to y=1, or S to stay y=0, or D to y=-1 but y must be >=0, so D not possible at y=0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so at y=0, if a_t = D, y_{t+1} = -1, but not allowed, so I think we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nFrom the equation: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0, cannot do D, because y would be -1 <0. Similarly, at y=9, cannot do U.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, D or S, not U.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t=H.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 safe always, we can stay there if needed.\n\nBut min H, so go up.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nFirst, to go from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 steps up, but we can have stay or down, which add turns.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 9, but may be more due to avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, action at t=0: we can do U or S.\n\nIf U, then at t=1, y=1.\n\nNow, at t=1, if y=1, is it safe?\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=0,7,8,9.\n\nt=1 is not in {0,7,8,9}, so at t=1, y=1 is safe? Freeway y=1 at time t=1.\n\nFrom above, y=1 unsafe only at t=0,7,8,9.\n\nt=0,7,8,9 are times when x=0 covered.\n\nAt t=1, not covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same.\n\nNow, but y=5 unsafe at t=1.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=1, we are on y=1 at t=1, which is safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's list the times when each row is unsafe.\n\ny=1: unsafe t=0,7,8,9\n\ny=2: t=0,7,8,9\n\ny=3: t=0,6,7\n\ny=4: t=0,6,7\n\ny=5: t=1,4\n\ny=6: t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: always safe\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe always, but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe when player is there.\n\nNow, player position over time.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nFor collision, at time t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and freeway y_t unsafe at time t.\n\nWe need for all t, either y_t not in 1-8, or if in 1-8, freeway y_t safe at t.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we only worry when on freeways.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, only delay when necessary.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe spots.\n\nFirst, early on, y=5 is unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\nt=1 and t=4.\n\nIf we are on y=5 at t=1 or t=4, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=1-4 unsafe at certain times.\n\nSince we start at y=0, t=0.\n\nWe can go up immediately.\n\nOption: at t=0, action U: then y1=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1, y=1: y=1 safe at t=1? Yes, only unsafe at 0,7,8,9.\n\nt=1 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=1, action U: y2=2 at t=2.\n\ny=2 at t=2: safe? y=2 unsafe t=0,7,8,9, t=2 not, safe.\n\nAction U: y3=3 at t=3.\n\ny=3 at t=3: unsafe times t=0,6,7. t=3 not, safe.\n\nAction U: y4=4 at t=4.\n\ny=4 at t=4: y=4 unsafe at t=0,6,7. t=4 not, so safe? t=4 not in {0,6,7}, so safe.\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at t=4.\n\nNow y4=4 at t=4.\n\nThen action at t=4: if U, y5=5 at t=5.\n\ny=5 at t=5: unsafe times t=1,4. t=5 not, so should be safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at t=1 and t=4.\n\nAt t=5, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nThen U to y6=6 at t=6.\n\ny=6 at t=6: y=6 unsafe at t=16-19, t=6 not, so safe.\n\nThen U to y7=7 at t=7.\n\ny=7 at t=7: y=7 always safe, good.\n\nBut y=7 at t=7 is safe.\n\nThen U to y8=8 at t=8.\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\nThen U to y9=9 at t=9.\n\nNow, at t=9, y=9, which is the goal, and safe.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=0: y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAction U: to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway 1 safe at t=1? Yes, not unsafe time.\n\nAction U: to y=2 at t=2.\n\nt=2: y=2, safe, not unsafe time.\n\nAction U: to y=3 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=3, unsafe times t=0,6,7. t=3 not, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=4 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=4, unsafe times t=0,6,7. t=4 not, safe.\n\nNow action at t=4: U to y=5 at t=5.\n\nt=5: y=5, unsafe times t=1,4. t=5 not, so safe? y=5 unsafe at t=1 and t=4 only, t=5 safe.\n\nThen action U to y=6 at t=6.\n\nt=6: y=6, unsafe times t=16-19, t=6 not, safe.\n\nAction U to y=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7: y=7, always safe.\n\nBut y=7 is freeway, and safe at all t, so at t=7 safe.\n\nThen action U to y=8 at t=8.\n\nt=8: y=8, safe.\n\nAction U to y=9 at t=9.\n\nt=9: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H=9 turns? Actions from t=0 to t=8, 9 actions, to reach at t=9.\n\nt=0 to t=8 actions, y from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nBut we need to check for t=7 and t=8.\n\nAt t=7, player is on y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at t=7, but player not there.\n\nSimilarly at t=8, player on y=8, safe.\n\nAt t=9, player on y=9, safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=7, player is on y=7, which is fine.\n\nIs there any issue at t=4?\n\nAt t=4, player is on y=4, which we said safe, since y=4 unsafe only at t=0,6,7, not t=4.\n\nt=0,6,7 for y=4.\n\nt=4 not included.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=5, safe.\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at t=4, but at t=4 player is on y=4, not y=5.\n\nIn this sequence, we avoided the unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, y=5 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, but at t=1, player was on y=1, and at t=4, on y=4, not on y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, on y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, later times no issue.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe only late, not relevant.\n\nSo with H=9, we can reach.\n\nBut is it possible in less? H=9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9 with all U, but we have to start from t=0.\n\nMinimal possible is 9, since 9 steps up.\n\nWe could have stays or downs, but that would increase H, so H=9 should be minimal.\n\nIn this case, it seems possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=1 and y=2 are unsafe, but player is on y=7, fine.\n\nAt t=4, y=5 is unsafe, but player on y=4.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=4, y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is safe at t=4, yes.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at turn T, only y_T matters.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=4, action U, so at turn t=4, player is on y=4, then moves to y=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=4, on y=4, safe.\n\nAt t=5, on y=5, safe since t=5 not unsafe for y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at t=4, but at t=4 we are not on y=5.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start later, but that might increase H.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for some time, then H larger.\n\nSo H=9 seems achievable.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nt_1 is given as 8, so actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn terms of offset τ.\n\nτ from 0 to H-1 for actions.\n\nIn this case, H=9, actions at τ=0 to 8.\n\nTurn t_1 + τ for τ=0 to 8.\n\nActions: all U, I think.\n\nIn the sequence: a_t1, a_t1+1, ..., up to a_t1 + H-1.\n\nHere all actions U.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=8.\n\nPlayer position at turn t_1: (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1+1, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions all U starting from t_1.\n\nTurn t_1: action a_{t_1} = U, then at turn t_1+1, position (0,1)\n\nThen a_{t_1+1} = U, position at t_1+2: (0,2)\n\n...\n\nUp to a_{t_1+8} = U, position at t_1+9: (0,9)\n\nNow, turns: from t_1 to t_1+8 for actions, 9 actions.\n\nReach at turn t_1+9.\n\nNow, check collisions during the path.\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t=0 to 8? Position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor T from t_1 to t_1+8, but at T=t_1, y=0, not on freeway.\n\nCollision possible only when on freeway, i.e., y between 1 and 8.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn T = t_1 + k, for k=0 to 8, but position:\n\nAt turn T=t_1, y=0\n\nAfter action, at turn T=t_1+1, y=1\n\n...\n\nAt turn T=t_1+9, y=9\n\nSo for turns when player on freeway: from T=t_1+1 to T=t_1+8, y from 1 to 8.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn T=t_1+1, y=1\n\nT=t_1+2, y=2\n\nT=t_1+3, y=3\n\nT=t_1+4, y=4\n\nT=t_1+5, y=5\n\nT=t_1+6, y=6\n\nT=t_1+7, y=7\n\nT=t_1+8, y=8\n\nNow, t_1=8, so actual turns:\n\nT=9, y=1\n\nT=10, y=2\n\nT=11, y=3\n\nT=12, y=4\n\nT=13, y=5\n\nT=14, y=6\n\nT=15, y=7\n\nT=16, y=8\n\nNow, check for each, if collision.\n\nFirst, at T=9, y=1: freeway y=1 at time T=9.\n\nT=9, which is time offset t = T - t_1 = 9 - 8 =1\n\nEarlier we used time offset t.\n\nt = T - t_1\n\nAt T=9, t=1\n\ny=1 at t=1: earlier, y=1 unsafe at t=0,7,8,9\n\nt=1 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=10, y=2, t=2: y=2 unsafe t=0,7,8,9, t=2 not, safe.\n\nT=11, y=3, t=3: y=3 unsafe t=0,6,7, t=3 not, safe.\n\nT=12, y=4, t=4: y=4 unsafe t=0,6,7, t=4 not, safe.\n\nT=13, y=5, t=5: y=5 unsafe t=1,4, t=5 not, safe.\n\nT=14, y=6, t=6: y=6 unsafe t=16,17,18,19, t=6 not, safe.\n\nT=15, y=7, t=7: y=7 always safe.\n\nT=16, y=8, t=8: y=8 always safe.\n\nAnd at T=17, y=9, but not on freeway.\n\nIn this, at T=16, y=8, t=8.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nBut t=8, is there any issue with other rows? No.\n\nIn the unsafe times, for example, y=1 unsafe at t=8? t=8.\n\nt=8, y=1 unsafe.\n\nBut at t=8, which is T=t_1 + 8 =8+8=16, and at that time, player is on y=8, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, T=17, player at y=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, with all U actions, we can reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut H=9, from action at t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at turn 8 to 16? Let's list.\n\nTurn t_1 =8: action a_8 = U\n\nThen position at turn 9: (0,1)\n\nTurn 9: action a_9 = U, position at turn 10: (0,2)\n\n...\n\nTurn 15: action a_15 = U, position at turn 16: (0,8)\n\nTurn 16: action a_16 = U, position at turn 17: (0,9)\n\nActions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, here H=9, so actions at turn 8 to 16? t_1=8, H=9, actions at τ=0 to 8, turns 8 to 16? t_1 + τ for τ=0 to 8, so turns 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nPosition after last action at turn 17, y=9.\n\nIn the action list, we need to specify for each turn the action.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith y reaching 9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, all actions U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we are on unsafe position.\n\nFor example, at turn 13, T=13, t=5, y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut earlier y=5 unsafe at t=4, which is T=12, t=4.\n\nAt T=12, t=4, y=4, which is not y=5.\n\ny=4 at t=4 is safe, since y=4 unsafe only at t=0,6,7.\n\nt=4 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, T=14, y=6, safe.\n\nBut t=6 is T=14, y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=16-19, t=6 not.\n\nNow, at t=7, T=15, y=7, safe.\n\nt=8, T=16, y=8, safe.\n\nBut t=8, for y=1, it is unsafe, but we are not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, t=9, y=1 unsafe, but at t=9, T=17, we are at y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 17.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nWith stays, it would take more turns.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut let me check the car on y=6, unsafe at t=16-19.\n\nt=16-19, which is T=24 to 27, since t_1=8, t= T - 8.\n\nt=16: T=24, t=17:T=25, etc.\n\nIn our path, at t=6, T=14, we are on y=6, which is fine, and we move up before t=16.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly, all seems clear.\n\nBut in the beginning, at t=0, we could stay, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if at t=0, we stay, y=0, then at t=1, y=0 or go to y=1, but then we reach later.\n\nSo H=9 is best.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster in some parts, but no, since we need exactly 9 up moves.\n\nUnless we can skip some, but no, must go through each y.\n\nNot necessarily, we can go directly, but each move changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 steps.\n\nSo H=9 is achievable and minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 actions.\n\nBut in the output, for each turn.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nThen at turn 17, position (0,9)\n\nIn the action list, from turn 8 to turn 16, that's 9 turns: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the boxed answer.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car definitions.\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, at t=4, it is unsafe.\n\nt=4, which is T=12.\n\nIn our path, at T=12, we are on y=4, not y=5.\n\ny=5 at T=13, t=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nSequence: all U.\n\nBut in the format.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 3 and 4, unsafe at t=6 and t=7.\n\nt=6: T=14, t=7:T=15.\n\nIn our path, at T=14, y=6; T=15, y=7.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at t=6,7, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nAt t=6, T=14, we are on y=6, which is fine.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, it works.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to go slower, H larger, not better.\n\nOr if we go down, worse.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 actions.\n\nNow, output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists entirely of \"U\" (up) moves, as this direct upward path avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) based on the car positions and movements.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) (time offset \\(t = 0\\).\n- After each \"U\" action, the player moves to the next higher \\(y\\) coordinate at each subsequent turn.\n- The position and time for each turn when the player is on a freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) are checked against the unsafe times derived from the car states:\n  - Freeway 1 (\\(y=1\\)): Unsafe at \\(t = 0, 7, 8, 9\\) → Safe at relevant times.\n  - Freeway 2 (\\(y=2\\)): Unsafe at \\(t = 0, 7, 8, 9\\) → Safe at relevant times.\n  - Freeway 3 (\\(y=3\\)): Unsafe at \\(t = 0, 6, 7\\) → Safe at relevant times.\n  - Freeway 4 (\\(y=4\\)): Unsafe at \\(t = 0, 6, 7\\) → Safe at relevant times.\n  - Freeway 5 (\\(y=5\\)): Unsafe at \\(t = 1, 4\\) → Safe at relevant times.\n  - Freeway 6 (\\(y=6\\)): Unsafe at \\(t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\) → Safe at relevant times.\n  - Freeway 7 (\\(y=7\\)): Always safe.\n  - Freeway 8 (\\(y=8\\)): Always safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions and positions:\n- At turn 8 (\\(t = 0\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 9 is \\((0, 1)\\) → \\(y=1\\) at \\(t=1\\) (safe, not unsafe time).\n- At turn 9 (\\(t = 1\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 10 is \\((0, 2)\\) → \\(y=2\\) at \\(t=2\\) (safe, not unsafe time).\n- At turn 10 (\\(t = 2\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 11 is \\((0, 3)\\) → \\(y=3\\) at \\(t=3\\) (safe, not unsafe time).\n- At turn 11 (\\(t = 3\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 12 is \\((0, 4)\\) → \\(y=4\\) at \\(t=4\\) (safe, not unsafe time).\n- At turn 12 (\\(t = 4\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 13 is \\((0, 5)\\) → \\(y=5\\) at \\(t=5\\) (safe, not unsafe time).\n- At turn 13 (\\(t = 5\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 14 is \\((0, 6)\\) → \\(y=6\\) at \\(t=6\\) (safe, not unsafe time).\n- At turn 14 (\\(t = 6\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 15 is \\((0, 7)\\) → \\(y=7\\) at \\(t=7\\) (always safe).\n- At turn 15 (\\(t = 7\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 16 is \\((0, 8)\\) → \\(y=8\\) at \\(t=8\\) (always safe).\n- At turn 16 (\\(t = 8\\)): Action \\(U\\), position at turn 17 is \\((0, 9)\\).\n\nAt turn 17, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), which is the goal and safe (no freeway at \\(y=9\\)). All actions are \"U\", and no collisions occur as the player is never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nSince moving directly upward with no delays achieves the minimum \\(H = 9\\) (as at least 9 up moves are required to go from \\(y=0\\) to \\(y=9\\)), and no shorter sequence is possible, this is optimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways from y=1 to y=8 (each row is a freeway). The player moves vertically (changing y) and the cars move horizontally (left or right) on their freeway.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn and there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes x=0.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y to y+1 or y-1 at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y. Only at the next turn (if staying) or when moving, at the next state the player is on the new row. So if we move at turn T from row y to row y+1, then at turn T the player is on row y and at turn T+1 the player is on row y+1.\n\nTherefore, when we are at row y at turn T, we check the cars on row y at turn T.\n\nOur goal: start at (0,1) at turn 9, and we want to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can use a BFS or Dijkstra-like approach over the state (turn, y) but note that the turn numbers can be large because we are waiting? However, note that the cars are moving and their positions are linear in time. We can compute for each freeway and each car, the times at which they cover x=0.\n\nBut note: the problem is asking for minimal H (number of turns) so we are to minimize the number of actions (turns) from turn 9.\n\nWe are allowed to move up, down, or stay. But we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 9. We want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves if there were no cars would be 8 (because we start at 1, and 9-1=8, so 8 ups). But we have to avoid the cars on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe must check for each row and each turn whether if we are on that row at that turn, then at that turn there is a car on that row that has x=0 in its span.\n\nWe have to plan a path that avoids being on a row when a car is covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nNote: the cars on a row are independent of the player's actions. They move according to their speed and direction.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=9. For each car, we know its head, tail, direction, speed at turn 9.\n\nBut note: the update rule for cars:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the update is:\n\nFor left-moving (but in the table, the direction is given as 'right' for all cars in this state). So we don't have left-moving? All are right-moving.\n\nSo for a car on a freeway at turn t1 with head h, tail tau (and note: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] because they move right so the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? But in the table, we see for example on freeway 1: (-24,-35,right,4). But note: if it's right-moving, then at turn t1=9, the car is moving right so the head should be the right end. But the numbers: -24 and -35. Since -24 > -35, then the head is -24 and tail is -35? That would be a car that is from -35 to -24 (so length 11) and moving right. Then at turn T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] = [-35 + 4*(T-9), -24 + 4*(T-9)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the car at turn T is at [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe care about when 0 is in the interval [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but we don't have any.\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the time intervals (if any) during which it covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the car might cover x=0 multiple times? Actually, since they are moving at constant speed and the road is infinite, they will cover x=0 at most once? Actually, if they move right, then as time increases, the car moves to the right. So the interval of time when 0 is covered is continuous? Actually, it's a continuous interval? But the problem is discrete in turns.\n\nThe car's position at turn T is fixed: the entire car moves by s*(T-t1) to the right.\n\nSo the condition for a car to cover 0 at turn T is:\n\ntau + s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t1)\n\nBut note: in the representation for right-moving, we have [tau, h] at t1, so at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nTherefore, we require:\n\ntau + s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t1)\n\nSolve for T:\n\ntau + s*(T-t1) <= 0  => T <= t1 - tau/s\n\nand\n\n0 <= h + s*(T-t1) => T >= t1 - h/s\n\nBut note: since h and tau are integers and s is integer, and T must be integer? Actually, the problem says \"turn\", so T is integer.\n\nSo we can compute for each car the set of turns T (>=t1) for which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the car might cover x=0 in a contiguous set of turns? Actually, the car moves continuously? But the problem states the update per turn. The car moves by s per turn? Actually, the update rule: at turn T, the car is at [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. This is a linear shift. So the car moves s units per turn to the right.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the car to cover 0 at turn T is:\n\ntau + s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t1)\n\nWe can rearrange:\n\n0 in [A, B] where A = tau + s*(T-t1), B = h + s*(T-t1)\n\nSo we need:\n\nA <= 0 <= B\n\n=> tau + s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t1)\n\n=> T <= t1 - tau/s   and   T >= t1 - h/s\n\nBut note: since the car is moving right, and h > tau (because at t1, head h is greater than tail tau? Actually, in the example: freeway1: (-24,-35,right,4): then h=-24, tau=-35. So h > tau? Yes, because -24 > -35.\n\nSo the condition becomes:\n\nt1 - h/s <= T <= t1 - tau/s\n\nBut note: h is negative? So -h/s is positive. Similarly, tau is more negative, so -tau/s is larger.\n\nExample for the first car on freeway1: h=-24, tau=-35, s=4, t1=9.\n\nThen T must satisfy:\n\n9 - (-24)/4 = 9 + 24/4 = 9+6 = 15\n\nand\n\n9 - (-35)/4 = 9 + 35/4 = 9 + 8.75 = 17.75\n\nBut T is integer, so T from 15 to 17? But 17.75, so T<=17.75 -> T<=17? And T>=15.\n\nSo T=15,16,17.\n\nBut let me check:\n\nAt T=15: \n  tau + s*(T-t1) = -35 + 4*(15-9) = -35 + 4*6 = -35+24 = -11\n  h + s*(T-t1) = -24 + 24 = 0\n\nSo the car is from -11 to 0 at T=15? Then 0 is the right edge? The problem says \"only if 0 is in the span\". The span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-11,0]. So 0 is included? Yes.\n\nAt T=16: \n  tau + s*(16-9)= -35 + 4*7 = -35+28 = -7\n  h + s*(16-9)= -24+28=4\n  so [ -7,4] -> 0 is included.\n\nAt T=17:\n  tau + s*(17-9)= -35 + 4*8 = -35+32 = -3\n  h + s*(17-9)= -24+32=8 -> [-3,8] -> 0 included.\n\nAt T=18: \n  tau: -35+4*9=-35+36=1\n  h: -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo indeed T=15,16,17.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every car on every freeway.\n\nWe are going to build a set of (freeway, turn) pairs that are dangerous.\n\nBut note: the player is only at one freeway at a time. And at a given turn, we only care about the freeway we are on.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving from y=1 to y=9. The minimal moves without waiting is 8 moves (all U). But we may have to wait on some rows to avoid cars.\n\nWe can do a BFS over (time, y) where time is the turn number (starting at t1=9). The state is (t, y) meaning that at turn t, the player is at row y.\n\nWe start at (9,1). We want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nActions: U, D, S. But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe cost is the number of turns (each action is one turn). We want to minimize the total turns until we first reach y=9.\n\nWe simulate from time t=9 onward.\n\nAt each state (t, y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} which leads to:\n\n- If a=U: then at time t+1, we are at y+1 (if y+1<=9)\n- If a=D: then at time t+1, we are at y-1 (if y-1>=0)\n- If a=S: then at time t+1, we are at y.\n\nBut note: during the transition, we are at row y at time t (so we must check that row y at time t is safe). Then we move to the next state at time t+1.\n\nImportant: at the starting state (t=9, y=1): we are at row 1 at time 9. We must check if row 1 at time 9 is safe? But we are given that we are at (0,1) at turn 9, so presumably it is safe? But we have to check the cars.\n\nSo first, we must compute for each freeway (row) and for each car on that freeway, the set of turns when that freeway is dangerous (i.e., at least one car covers x=0).\n\nWe'll create a set `danger` of tuples (row, turn) for which that row at that turn is dangerous.\n\nBut note: a row is dangerous at turn t if at least one car on that row has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn t1=9.\n\nFor each car: (head, tail, direction, speed) and the freeway k.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, we use:\n\nFor a car: condition: \n  tau + s*(t - 9) <= 0 <= head + s*(t - 9)\n\nBut note: in the table, for a car we have (h, tau, d, s). But the representation: for freeway1: (-24,-35,right,4). Which is h=-24, tau=-35.\n\nSo condition:\n\n-35 + 4*(t-9) <= 0 <= -24 + 4*(t-9)\n\nWe can write:\n\nLet dt = t-9.\n\nThen: \n  -35 + 4*dt <= 0  => 4*dt <= 35 => dt <= 35/4 = 8.75 => dt <= 8 (since integer) ? But wait, we have two conditions:\n\nCondition 1: tau + s*dt <= 0 -> -35 + 4*dt <= 0 -> 4*dt <= 35 -> dt <= 8.75 -> since dt integer, dt <= 8? But we had above for the same car that at t=9+dt, and we found T=15,16,17 -> dt=6,7,8.\n\nAt dt=6: t=15 -> -35+4*6 = -35+24=-11<=0, and -24+24=0<=0 -> holds.\n\nAt dt=8: t=17: -35+32=-3<=0, and -24+32=8>=0 -> holds.\n\nAt dt=9: t=18: -35+36=1>0 -> fails the first condition.\n\nSo condition: \n  tau + s*dt <= 0  -> dt <= ceil(-tau/s)? Actually, we have:\n\n  dt_min = ceil( ( - head ) / s )   ??? \n\nActually, from:\n\n  0 <= head + s*dt  => dt >= ceil( -head / s )   [since head is negative, -head positive]\n\nand \n\n  tau + s*dt <= 0  => dt <= floor( -tau / s )\n\nBut note: because we are using integers and the inequalities are inclusive.\n\nIn our example: head=-24, s=4 -> -head/s = 24/4=6 -> so dt>=6.\n\ntau=-35 -> -tau/s = 35/4=8.75 -> so dt<=8.75 -> since dt integer, dt<=8.\n\nSo the dangerous dt are from 6 to 8.\n\nSimilarly, for each car, we compute:\n\ndt_min = ceil( ( - head ) / s )   [if head<0]? Actually, if head is positive at t1, then at t1 the head is already positive, so we require head+s*dt>=0 -> which might be true for all dt>=0? But note: if head is positive at t1, then at t1, the car is already to the right of 0? But we have to check if the tail is <=0? Actually, the condition is the entire interval must cover 0: so we require tail + s*dt <=0 and head+s*dt>=0.\n\nBut in our data, all cars have negative head and tail? Let me check:\n\nFreeway1: all cars have head and tail negative? First car: (-24,-35), second: (12,1) -> wait, second car: (12,1,right,4). At t1=9, the car is from 1 to 12? Then at turn T, it will be [1+4*(T-9), 12+4*(T-9)].\n\nCondition: 1+4*(T-9) <= 0 <= 12+4*(T-9)\n\nBut 1+4*(T-9) is positive for T>=9? So the first inequality fails? So this car does not cover 0 at any T>=9? Because the left end is 1 at T=9 and increases. So 0 is never covered.\n\nSimilarly, the third car: (48,37) -> even more positive.\n\nSo for the second and third cars on freeway1, they are already to the right of 0 and moving right, so they never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway3: (-30,-41,right,6) and (48,37,right,6) and (12,1,right,6). Only the first car might cover 0? Because the others are positive.\n\nFor the first car on freeway3: h=-30, tau=-41, s=6.\n\nThen dt_min = ceil( ( - (-30) ) / 6 ) = ceil(30/6)=5\n\ndt_max = floor( ( - (-41) ) / 6 ) = floor(41/6)=floor(6.833)=6\n\nSo dt from 5 to 6? Then t=9+5=14 and 9+6=15.\n\nCheck: at dt=5: t=14\n  tau: -41+6*5 = -41+30 = -11\n  head: -30+30=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 included.\n\nat dt=6: t=15\n  tau: -41+36=-5\n  head: -30+36=6 -> [-5,6] -> 0 included.\n\nat dt=7: t=16\n  tau: -41+42=1 -> [1,?] head=-30+42=12 -> [1,12] -> no 0.\n\nSo dangerous at t=14,15.\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway3 are positive and won't cover 0.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? The data is the same: (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6) -> so same as freeway3: dangerous at t=14,15.\n\nFreeway5: (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) -> at t1=9: [ -11, 0] -> so at t1=9, it covers 0? Then condition: \n  tau + s*dt <=0 and head+s*dt>=0 -> -11+12*dt <=0 and 0+12*dt>=0.\n\nThe second inequality: 12*dt>=0 -> always true for dt>=0.\n\nFirst inequality: -11+12*dt<=0 -> 12*dt<=11 -> dt<=11/12 -> so dt=0? Only at dt=0? Then t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, we are at row 1, and this car is on row 5? So we are not on row 5 at t=9, so we are safe? But if we are on row5 at t=9, then we collide.\n\nBut note: at t=9, we are at row1, so we don't collide with row5.\n\nNow, at future times: \n  At dt=0: t=9: [ -11, 0] -> covers 0.\n  At dt=1: t=10: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo only at t=9, row5 is dangerous.\n\nBut we are not on row5 at t=9.\n\nNow the second car on freeway5: (-36,-47,right,12)\n  dt_min = ceil( ( - (-36) ) / 12 ) = ceil(36/12)=3\n  dt_max = floor( ( - (-47) ) / 12 ) = floor(47/12)=floor(3.916)=3\n  So only dt=3? t=9+3=12.\n\nCheck: \n  at t=12: tau: -47+12*3 = -47+36=-11\n        head: -36+36=0 -> [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n\nThird car: positive, so no.\n\nSo freeway5 is dangerous at t=9 (from first car) and t=12 (from second car).\n\nBut note: at t=9: only the first car is dangerous? and at t=12: the second car is dangerous.\n\nFreeway6: only one car: (-45,-56,right,3)\n  dt_min = ceil(45/3)=15\n  dt_max = floor(56/3)=floor(18.666)=18\n  so dt from 15 to 18: t=24,25,26,27.\n\nFreeway7: (-48,-71,right,24)\n  dt_min = ceil(48/24)=2\n  dt_max = floor(71/24)=floor(2.958)=2\n  so only at dt=2 -> t=11.\n\nCheck: at t=11: \n  tau: -71+24*(11-9)= -71+48=-23\n  head: -48+48=0 -> [-23,0] -> covers 0.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7: (-48,-71,right,24) -> so dangerous at t=11.\n\nNow, we compile the dangerous (row, turn) pairs:\n\nRow1: \n  Cars: \n    (-24,-35,4): dangerous at t=15,16,17\n    (12,1,4): not dangerous\n    (48,37,4): not dangerous\n  So row1: t in {15,16,17}\n\nRow2: same as row1 -> t in {15,16,17}\n\nRow3: \n  (-30,-41,6): dangerous at t=14,15\n  others: not\n  so {14,15}\n\nRow4: same as row3 -> {14,15}\n\nRow5:\n  (0,-11,12): dangerous at t=9\n  (-36,-47,12): dangerous at t=12\n  so {9,12}\n\nRow6:\n  (-45,-56,3): dangerous at t=24,25,26,27\n\nRow7:\n  (-48,-71,24): dangerous at t=11\n\nRow8:\n  same as row7: dangerous at t=11\n\nWe now have:\n\nrow1: {15,16,17}\nrow2: {15,16,17}\nrow3: {14,15}\nrow4: {14,15}\nrow5: {9,12}\nrow6: {24,25,26,27}\nrow7: {11}\nrow8: {11}\n\nNote: we start at t=9, row1.\n\nWe are going to simulate the state (t, y). We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe'll use a BFS (since the cost per move is 1) over the state (t, y). We start at (9,1) with cost 0.\n\nWe maintain a queue, and we mark visited states to avoid cycles. But note: we might want to wait arbitrarily? But the dangerous times are only at specific times, and beyond that we can move freely? However, the grid is small (y from 0 to 9) and time we can bound? But note: the dangerous times go up to t=27. So we can set a bound, say until t=30.\n\nBut we want minimal turns. We start at t=9. The minimal turns is at least 8 (if we go straight up). But we have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nWe'll generate states until we find one at y=9.\n\nWe keep a visited set: (t,y) to avoid duplicates.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nWe start:\n\nState: (t=9, y=1) -> safe? row1 at t=9: dangerous? row1 is dangerous at {15,16,17} -> so t=9 is safe. So we start.\n\nFrom (9,1), we can do:\n\n  U: then at t=10, y=2\n  D: then at t=10, y=0 -> but then we have to come back, probably not optimal?\n  S: then at t=10, y=1\n\nWe want to avoid dangerous states.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nLet me try to go straight up:\n\nPlan A: U every step.\n\nt0=9: y=1 (safe) -> action U -> next state: t=10, y=2.\n\nAt t=10, y=2: check row2 at t=10: dangerous times {15,16,17} -> safe. Then U -> t=11, y=3.\n\nAt t=11, y=3: row3 dangerous at {14,15} -> safe? t=11 not in {14,15} -> safe. Then U -> t=12, y=4.\n\nAt t=12, y=4: row4 dangerous at {14,15} -> safe. Then U -> t=13, y=5.\n\nAt t=13, y=5: row5 dangerous at {9,12} -> 12 is dangerous -> so at t=12, row5 is dangerous? but we are at t=13? So we are on row5 at t=13: is it dangerous? The dangerous times for row5 are 9 and 12. So t=13 is safe. Then U -> t=14, y=6.\n\nAt t=14, y=6: row6 dangerous at {24,...,27} -> safe. Then U -> t=15, y=7.\n\nAt t=15, y=7: row7 dangerous at {11} -> safe? Then U -> t=16, y=8.\n\nAt t=16, y=8: row8 dangerous at {11} -> safe. Then U -> t=17, y=9. We reached at t=17.\n\nBut we must check the entire path for collisions:\n\nWe are at row y at time t:\n\nt=9: y=1 -> safe (row1 safe at t=9)\nt=10: y=2 -> safe (row2 safe at t=10)\nt=11: y=3 -> safe (row3 safe at t=11)\nt=12: y=4 -> safe (row4 safe at t=12)\nt=13: y=5 -> safe (row5 safe at t=13)\nt=14: y=6 -> safe (row6 safe at t=14)\nt=15: y=7 -> safe (row7 safe at t=15)\nt=16: y=8 -> safe (row8 safe at t=16)\nt=17: y=9 -> we are done, and row9 has no cars? The freeways are only 1-8. So row9 is safe.\n\nSo this path: 8 moves (from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves) and we used 8 turns? Actually, from turn9 to turn17: that's 8 steps? \n\nBut the number of actions: we start at turn9 and do 8 actions: \n  turn9: U -> to y=2 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> to y=3 at turn11\n  ...\n  turn16: U -> to y=9 at turn17.\n\nSo we did 8 actions: from turn9 to turn16 (inclusive) and then at turn17 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem: we are to write the actions from turn t1 (which is 9) for H turns. And H is the minimal number of turns to reach (0,9). We reach at turn17, which is after H=8 actions (starting at turn9: actions at turns 9,10,...,16).\n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. So H=8? Then actions at t=9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nAnd we reached at turn17? But the position at turn17 is (0,9). \n\nThe definition: after H actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nAt turn9: we start at (0,1). Then after the first action (at turn9) we are at (0,2) at turn10? But we want to be at (0,9) at the end.\n\nIn the path above: at turn17 we are at (0,9). The actions were taken at turns9,10,...,16 (8 actions). So after 8 actions, at turn17, we are at (0,9). So H=8.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? The minimal steps is 8 because we start at y=1 and need to get to y=9, which is 8 steps up. So we cannot do less than 8.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. We did avoid? But let me double-check the dangerous times:\n\nAt t=15: we were at y=7. Row7 is dangerous only at t=11 -> so safe.\n\nAt t=16: we were at y=8. Row8 dangerous only at t=11 -> safe.\n\nBut wait: what about the rows we passed through? We passed:\n\nt=9: y=1 -> safe? row1: dangerous at 15,16,17 -> safe.\nt=10: y=2 -> row2: same -> safe.\nt=11: y=3 -> row3: dangerous at 14,15 -> but t=11 is not in there -> safe.\nt=12: y=4 -> row4: dangerous at 14,15 -> safe.\nt=13: y=5 -> row5: dangerous at 9,12 -> but t=13 is not 9 or 12 -> safe.\nt=14: y=6 -> row6: dangerous at 24,25,26,27 -> safe.\nt=15: y=7 -> row7: dangerous at 11 -> safe.\nt=16: y=8 -> row8: dangerous at 11 -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut note: at t=17 we are at y=9 and we don't need to check because there are no cars on y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nThe actions: all U.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut wait, we started at y=1 at turn9. After first U at turn9, at turn10 we are at y=2. Then at turn11: y=3, and so on until turn16: we do the last U and at turn17 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem: we must output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So H=8, so turns 9 to 16.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut is there a problem? What if we are at row5 at t=12? But in our path, at t=12 we are at row4. Row4 is safe at t=12.\n\nBut note: row5 is dangerous at t=12. But we are not on row5 at t=12. We are on row4 at t=12, and then at t=13 we move to row5, and at t=13 row5 is safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut what about row7 and row8 at t=11? At t=11 we are at row3, so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, this path works.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=8.\n\nBut is there a path with H<8? Impossible because we need to go up 8 steps.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 8 without waiting? We did.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We can't.\n\nSo the answer is 8 consecutive U's.\n\nBut the output format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. And t1=9.\n\nBut in the state, we started at turn9 at y=1, and then we did an action at turn9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are at (0,1) at turn9, then we choose an action for turn9.\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we did avoid.\n\nBut let me double-check row5 at t=12: row5 is dangerous at t=12. But we are at row4 at t=12, and row4 is safe. Then at t=13 we move to row5 and row5 is safe at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, row7 and row8 at t=11: we are at row3 at t=11, which is safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, and the sequence is all U's.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? Then H would be more. But we didn't.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 8. The sequence of actions is all \"U\" (up) moves, as this is the shortest path vertically, and the car movement patterns do not require any detours or waiting. The path avoids collisions because the player is never on a freeway \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\) at a turn when any car on that freeway covers \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn 9: Player is at \\(y = 1\\). Row 1 is dangerous at turns 15, 16, 17, but turn 9 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10: \\(y = 2\\). Row 2 is dangerous at turns 15, 16, 17, but turn 10 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11: \\(y = 3\\). Row 3 is dangerous at turns 14, 15, but turn 11 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12: \\(y = 4\\). Row 4 is dangerous at turns 14, 15, but turn 12 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13: \\(y = 5\\). Row 5 is dangerous at turns 9, 12, but turn 13 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14: \\(y = 6\\). Row 6 is dangerous at turns 24–27, but turn 14 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15: \\(y = 7\\). Row 7 is dangerous at turn 11, but turn 15 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16: \\(y = 8\\). Row 8 is dangerous at turn 11, but turn 16 is safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17. Freeway \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, so it is safe, and the goal is reached.\n\nThe actions are applied from turn 9 to turn 16 (8 actions), and the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 10, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 10.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T. You only occupy the new position at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. So once we're at y=9, we're safe.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so no collisions possible there. Similarly, y=0 is the bottom, but we start at y=2 and need to go up, so y=0 might be a safe spot too, but we need to get to 9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so they are safe positions. But since we need to reach (0,9), we should aim for that.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t_1=10.\n\nFor each freeway, k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. In the update rules, it says left-moving and right-moving, but in the car state, it's given as \"direction d\", and in the table, for all cars, it says \"right\". Let me check.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nFor freeway 1: all cars have direction right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: all right.\n\nFreeway 3: all right.\n\n4: all right.\n\n5: all right.\n\n6: only one car, right.\n\n7: right.\n\n8: right.\n\nAll cars are moving to the right? But in the update rule, for left-moving, it decreases position, for right-moving, it increases.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nLeft-moving: span moves left, so head and tail decrease.\n\nRight-moving: span moves right, so head and tail increase.\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, so for each car, the span is increasing over time.\n\nAlso, collision occurs if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nNow, since all cars are moving right, and 0 is a fixed point, we need to find when a car's span covers x=0 at a given turn.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, since it's (0,y), so we only care about when the car's span includes x=0.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need to model the position of the car over time to see when x=0 is covered.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=10 being the current turn.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail τ at t=10, direction right, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] for right-moving, since it moves right.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] with t_1=10.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving it would decrease, but all are right-moving here.\n\nAlso, head and tail: in the notation, for example, freeway 1: car (-20,-31, right,4). Head is -20, tail is -31? That seems odd because usually head is larger, but since it's moving right, and positions are on a line, I think we need to interpret the span.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-20, -31, right, 4). Since direction is right, and head and tail, but -20 > -31, so if head is at -20 and tail at -31, that means the car extends from x=-31 to x=-20, I think? But tail should be less than head if moving right? I'm confused.\n\nLet's look back at the update rule.\n\nIn the car update: for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ] then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, span is given as [h, τ] with h and τ, and for right-moving, [τ, h].\n\nIn the car state table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but based on direction, the order might be different.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars are given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-20, -31, right, 4)\n\nSince direction is right, the span should be interpreted as [tail, head]? From the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nIn the notation, it's (head, tail), but head might be the front.\n\nFor right-moving, the car is moving right, so the head is the rightmost point, tail is leftmost.\n\nIn the update rule for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ being the tail (left) and h being the head (right).\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] with h head (left?) and τ tail (right), then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, so for each car, span at t1=10 is [τ, h] with τ tail (left end), h head (right end).\n\nSo for freeway 1, first car: (head, tail) = (-20, -31, right, 4) so since right, span is [τ, h] = [-31, -20] at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (16,5,right,4), span [5,16] at t=10.\n\nThird car: (52,41,right,4), span [41,52] at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSpan at T: for right-moving car with initial τ, h at t=10, span at T is [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)]\n\n0 in span means τ + s(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-10)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nAlso, since multiple cars per freeway, but we just need if any car covers 0.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at turn 10.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U, D, S to move up, down, or stay.\n\nEach action changes y for the next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nLet t be the turn index, starting from t=10.\n\nAt turn t, player position is y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_t, at turn t, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered, i.e., for which turns T the freeway has a car with 0 in span.\n\nSince the cars move continuously in position but we sample at integer turns, and T is integer.\n\nAlso, since the span changes linearly, we can find the time intervals when 0 is covered for each car, then for each freeway, the union over cars.\n\nThen, for a given turn T, if y_T is that freeway, and if at T, 0 is covered, collision.\n\nPlayer can be at y=0 or y=9, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, let's analyze each freeway at turn t=10.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1:\n\nCars: (-20,-31,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (52,41,right,4)\n\nFor first car: span at T: [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] = [-31 + 4(T-10), -20 + 4(T-10)]\n\n0 in span: -31 + 4(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ -20 + 4(T-10)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -31 + 4(T-10) ≤ 0 => 4(T-10) ≤ 31 => T-10 ≤ 31/4 = 7.75, so T ≤ 10 + 7.75 = 17.75, since T integer, T ≤ 17\n\n-31 + 4(ΔT) ≤ 0 => 4(ΔT) ≤ 31 => ΔT ≤ 31/4 = 7.75, so ΔT ≤ 7 since integer? ΔT = T-10, so for ΔT from 0 to?\n\n-31 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 31 => ΔT ≤ 7.75\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ 7? But let's keep inequality.\n\n-31 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 implies ΔT ≤ 7.75, so for integer ΔT, ΔT ≤ 7? No, ΔT=7: -31 + 28 = -3 ≤0, true; ΔT=8: -31+32=1>0, false? Let's compute.\n\n-31 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 when 4ΔT ≤ 31, ΔT ≤ 7.75, so for ΔT=0 to 7 inclusive? ΔT=7: 4*7=28, -31+28=-3≤0, true; ΔT=8: 32-31=1>0, false.\n\nBut this is the left inequality.\n\nRight inequality: 0 ≤ -20 + 4ΔT => 20 ≤ 4ΔT => ΔT ≥ 5\n\nSo 0 ≤ -20 + 4ΔT => 4ΔT ≥ 20 => ΔT ≥ 5\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span when ΔT ≥ 5 and ΔT ≤ 7? From above:\n\nΔT ≥ 5 and ΔT ≤ 7.75, but since ΔT integer, ΔT = 5,6,7\n\nNow ΔT = T-10, so at T=15,16,17? T=10+5=15, T=10+6=16, T=10+7=17\n\nSimilarly, second car: (16,5,right,4), span at T: [5 + 4ΔT, 16 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in [5+4ΔT, 16+4ΔT] since 5+4ΔT >0 for ΔT≥0, and 16+4ΔT>0, but 0 ≤ 5+4ΔT? 0 in span if 5+4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 16+4ΔT\n\n5+4ΔT ≤ 0? But 5+4ΔT ≥5 >0 for all ΔT≥0, so 5+4ΔT >0, so 0 < 5+4ΔT ≤ something, so 0 cannot be ≤ 5+4ΔT since 5+4ΔT >0, thus 0 not in span for any T. Because the left end is at least 5, so always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (52,41,right,4), span [41+4ΔT,52+4ΔT] always positive and large, never near 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only first car can cover 0, at T=15,16,17.\n\nThus, freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 15,16,17. Safe otherwise.\n\nT=15,16,17 unsafe on y=1.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (-20,-31,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (52,41,right,4) identical to freeway 1.\n\nSo same, unsafe at T=15,16,17.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst car: span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at T=10, speed 6, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 6ΔT\n\nLeft: -35 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 35 => ΔT ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so ΔT ≤ 5\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -24 + 6ΔT => 24 ≤ 6ΔT => ΔT ≥ 4\n\nSo ΔT ≥4 and ΔT ≤5.833, so ΔT=4,5\n\nT=10+4=14, T=10+5=15\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6), span [43+6ΔT,54+6ΔT] min 43>0, never 0.\n\nThird car: (18,7,right,6), span [7+6ΔT,18+6ΔT] min 7>0, never 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at T=14,15.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6) identical, so unsafe at T=14,15.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12), span [1,12] at T=10? Since right, [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 1+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12ΔT\n\n1+12ΔT ≤ 0? 12ΔT ≤ -1, impossible since ΔT≥0. So never.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12), span [-35, -24] at T=10, at T: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in: -35+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24+12ΔT\n\nLeft: -35+12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤35 => ΔT ≤ 35/12 ≈2.916, so ΔT ≤2\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -24+12ΔT => 24 ≤12ΔT => ΔT ≥2\n\nSo ΔT ≥2 and ΔT ≤2.916, so ΔT=2\n\nT=10+2=12\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), span [49+12ΔT,60+12ΔT] always large positive, never 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nSpan at T: [-53 +3ΔT, -42 +3ΔT] since [τ,h]\n\n0 in: -53+3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42+3ΔT\n\nLeft: -53+3ΔT ≤0 => 3ΔT ≤53 => ΔT ≤53/3≈17.666, ΔT≤17\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -42+3ΔT => 42 ≤3ΔT => ΔT ≥14\n\nSo ΔT ≥14 and ΔT ≤17.666, so ΔT=14,15,16,17\n\nT=24,25,26,27\n\nT=10+14=24, 25,26,27\n\nNow freeway 7: car (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nSpan at T: [-47 +24ΔT, -24 +24ΔT]\n\n0 in: -47+24ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24+24ΔT\n\nLeft: -47+24ΔT ≤0 => 24ΔT ≤47 => ΔT ≤47/24≈1.958, so ΔT≤1\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -24+24ΔT => 24 ≤24ΔT => ΔT ≥1\n\nSo ΔT ≥1 and ΔT ≤1.958, so ΔT=1\n\nT=10+1=11\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Cars: (-24,-47,right,24) identical, so unsafe at T=11.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car same as freeway 7, so unsafe only at T=11.\n\nNow summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe T=15,16,17\n\n- y=2: unsafe T=15,16,17 (same as y=1)\n\n- y=3: unsafe T=14,15\n\n- y=4: unsafe T=14,15\n\n- y=5: unsafe T=12\n\n- y=6: unsafe T=24,25,26,27\n\n- y=7: unsafe T=11\n\n- y=8: unsafe T=11\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=24,25,26,27, which is far in the future, but we might not need to go there soon.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn 10.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 with min turns.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, the path: we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince we need to go up to 9, and start at 2, we need at least 7 up moves to reach 9, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nNow, at turn 10, player is at y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn 10, is y=2 unsafe?\n\nFrom above, freeway 2 unsafe at T=15,16,17, not at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, for y=2, cars: from above, freeway 2 has cars, but at T=10, for second car, span [5,16], which doesn't include 0, first car [-31,-20] doesn't include 0, so safe at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, we have unsafe times, but at T=10, all might be safe? Let's check.\n\nFor example, y=1 at T=10: first car span [-31,-20], not cover 0; others not, safe.\n\ny=2 same.\n\ny=3: at T=10, first car span [-35,-24], not cover 0, safe.\n\ny=4 same.\n\ny=5: at T=10, cars spans [1,12], [-35,-24], [49,60], none cover 0, safe.\n\ny=6: car span [-53,-42] not cover 0.\n\ny=7: span [-47,-24] at T=10? Car (-24,-47,right,24), span [τ,h] = [-47,-24], not cover 0.\n\ny=8 same.\n\nSo at turn 10, all freeways are safe, including y=2 where player is.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: we can go up, down, or stay each turn.\n\nBut we must avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nAlso, since we can stay or move down, we might delay to avoid bad times.\n\nBut we want min H, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\nSpecifically, for the lower freeways, there are unsafe times soon.\n\nFor example, y=7 and y=8 unsafe at T=11, which is next turn.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=11, y=8 unsafe at T=11.\n\nAt turn 11, if player is on y=7 or y=8, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=2 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, we choose action a_{10}, which affects y_{11}.\n\ny_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}, with Δy based on a_{10}.\n\nIf we go up, y_{11}=3; down y_{11}=1; stay y_{11}=2.\n\nAt turn 11, we need to not be on unsafe freeway.\n\nUnsafe at T=11: only y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, but player at turn 11 will be at y=1,2, or 3 if we move from y=2.\n\ny=1,2,3 are all safe at T=11, because:\n\ny=1 unsafe only at 15,16,17\n\ny=2 same\n\ny=3 unsafe at 14,15, not 11.\n\nSimilarly, others safe.\n\nSo at turn 11, no matter what we do from turn 10, y_{11} will be 1,2, or 3, all safe at T=11.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut we need to go up to 9.\n\nThe critical part might be around the unsafe times for the middle freeways.\n\nWe also have y=5 unsafe at T=12.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at T=12.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe turns per y:\n\ny=1: 15,16,17\n\ny=2: 15,16,17\n\ny=3: 14,15\n\ny=4: 14,15\n\ny=5: 12\n\ny=6: 24,25,26,27 (far)\n\ny=7: 11\n\ny=8: 11\n\ny=7 and y=8 only unsafe at T=11, which is soon, but we are at y=2, so we won't be on y=7 or 8 at T=11.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, if player is on y=5, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at T=14,15.\n\ny=1 and y=2 unsafe at T=15,16,17.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=2, we need to increase y by 7.\n\nMin turns: if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 at turn 10 + 7 = 17? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 10, y=2\n\nAfter one up: turn 11, y=3\n\nTurn 12, y=4\n\nTurn 13, y=5\n\nTurn 14, y=6\n\nTurn 15, y=7\n\nTurn 16, y=8\n\nTurn 17, y=9\n\nAt turn 17, y=9, which is not freeway, safe.\n\nBut during the path, we need to check for collisions at each turn.\n\nAt turn 10: y=2, safe as we saw.\n\nTurn 11: y=3 (if we go up), now y=3 is freeway, at T=11, unsafe? From above, y=3 unsafe at T=14,15, not 11, so safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=4, if we go up from y=3 to y=4.\n\nAt turn 12, y=4, freeway, unsafe times: y=4 unsafe at T=14,15, not 12. So safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=5, at T=13. y=5 unsafe only at T=12, not 13. So safe? At T=13, for y=5.\n\nFrom above, y=5 unsafe only at T=12, so at T=13, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 14: y=6, at T=14. y=6 unsafe at T=24-27, not 14, so safe.\n\nBut y=6 is freeway, but unsafe only at those late times, so at T=14, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=7, at T=15. y=7 unsafe only at T=11, not 15, so safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=8, at T=16. y=8 unsafe only at T=11, not 16, so safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, all positions are safe at those turns.\n\nBut at turn 12, when y=5, we said safe because unsafe only at T=12? At turn 12, y=5, and y=5 is unsafe at T=12.\n\nIn the sequence above: at turn 12, y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at T=12, meaning if player is on y=5 at turn 12, collision occurs.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 12, y=5, so collision!\n\nI missed that.\n\nSo in the direct up path:\n\nTurn 10: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=3, safe (T=11, y=3 safe)\n\nTurn 12: y=5? How?\n\nFrom turn 11 y=3, if action up, y=4 at turn 12? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn t: position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Turn 10: y=2, safe\n\n- Action a_{10}: if U, then y_{11} = 3\n\n- Turn 11: y=3, at T=11, y=3 unsafe? No, y=3 unsafe at T=14,15, not 11, so safe.\n\n- Then a_{11}: if U, y_{12} = 4\n\n- Turn 12: y=4, at T=12, y=4 unsafe? y=4 unsafe at T=14,15, not 12, so safe.\n\n- a_{12}: if U, y_{13} = 5\n\n- Turn 13: y=5, at T=13, y=5 unsafe only at T=12, not 13, so safe.\n\n- a_{13}: if U, y_{14} = 6\n\n- Turn 14: y=6, at T=14, y=6 unsafe only at T=24-27, not 14, safe.\n\n- a_{14}: if U, y_{15} = 7\n\n- Turn 15: y=7, at T=15, y=7 unsafe only at T=11, not 15, safe.\n\n- a_{15}: if U, y_{16} = 8\n\n- Turn 16: y=8, at T=16, y=8 unsafe only at T=11, not 16, safe.\n\n- a_{16}: if U, y_{17} = 9\n\n- Turn 17: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 13, y=5 at T=13, safe, but when is y=5 unsafe? At turn 12.\n\nIn turn 12, we have y=4, not y=5.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 12, y=4, which is safe at T=12.\n\nThen at turn 13, y=5, which is safe at T=13.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe only at T=12, so at T=13 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem?\n\nBut earlier I thought at turn 12 y=5, but in this sequence, at turn 12 y=4.\n\nLet's list the turn and y_t:\n\nt=10: y=2\n\nAfter a_{10}=U, y_{11}=3\n\nt=11: y=3\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=4\n\nt=12: y=4\n\na_{12}=U, y_{13}=5\n\nt=13: y=5\n\na_{13}=U, y_{14}=6\n\nt=14: y=6\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=7\n\nt=15: y=7\n\na_{15}=U, y_{16}=8\n\nt=16: y=8\n\na_{16}=U, y_{17}=9\n\nt=17: y=9\n\nNow, check safety at each t:\n\nt=10: y=2, freeway 2, at T=10, safe (unsafe at 15-17)\n\nt=11: y=3, freeway 3, at T=11, unsafe times 14,15, not 11, safe.\n\nt=12: y=4, freeway 4, at T=12, unsafe times 14,15, not 12, safe.\n\nt=13: y=5, freeway 5, at T=13, unsafe only at T=12, not 13, so safe.\n\nt=14: y=6, freeway 6, at T=14, unsafe at 24-27, not 14, safe.\n\nt=15: y=7, freeway 7, at T=15, unsafe only at T=11, not 15, safe.\n\nt=16: y=8, freeway 8, at T=16, unsafe only at T=11, not 16, safe.\n\nt=17: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo in this case, all safe, and we reach y=9 at turn 17 with 7 actions: all U from turn 10 to 16.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach, including start? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=10 to t=16, that's 7 actions, and at turn 17, y=9.\n\nThe minimal H should be the number of actions to reach in H-1 turns? Let's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nt1=10.\n\nSo y_{10 + H -1} =9\n\nAnd actions from t=10 to t=10 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1 +0, t1+1, ..., t1 + H-1\n\nThen after these actions, the position at turn t1 + H should be the result.\n\nAfter action a_t, position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after a_{t1 + H-1}, we have y_{t1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Inconsistency.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), meaning that after these actions, the player is at (0,9).\"\n\nBut after actions, the position is after the last action.\n\nDefine: at turn t, position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1=10, y_{10}=2.\n\nWe apply actions a_{10}, a_{11}, ..., up to a_{10 + K} for some K.\n\nAfter action a_{10 + K}, we have y_{11 + K}.\n\nWe want y_{11 + K} =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn 11 + K.\n\nThe number of actions is K+1.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen after these actions, y_{t1 + H} is the new position.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? Or y_{t1 + H -1}?\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nYes: \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-2}? t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1 +0 to t1 + (H-1)\n\nFor example, t=0: action at t1, t=1: action at t1+1, ..., t=H-1: action at t1 + H -1\n\nThen after action at t1 + H -1, we have y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1, before any action at that turn.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is given, then we take action a_t, then y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, we have position y_{t1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen, for that to happen, the actions taken before must have brought us to y=9 at that turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, which determine y from t1+1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's think.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nThen we take action a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, take a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t1 + k}, we have y_{t1 + k +1}.\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1.\n\nAnd the sequence has actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, but for H-1 actions? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t1 + t}, so actions at times: t1 +0, t1+1, ..., t1 + (H-1)\n\nThat's H actions.\n\nNow, after taking action a_{t}, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t1 + H -1} is determined by the actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nFor example, with H=1: sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 0}, so one action a_{t1}.\n\nThen after a_{t1}, we have y_{t1+1}, but we want y_{t1} =9, which is given, so if y_{t1} is not 9, we need actions.\n\nIn this case, at t1=10, y=2 ≠9, so we need H>1.\n\nGenerally, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need to apply H-1 actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} to reach y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe sequence given includes a_{t1 + H -1}, but that action is taken at turn t1 + H -1, which affects y_{t1 + H}, but since we already at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1, we might not need that action, or it could be irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps the sequence should be such that after the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, we reach y_{t1 + H -1} =9, and a_{t1 + H -1} is not needed, but the sequence includes it for t up to H-1.\n\nI think there might be confusion.\n\nLook at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" etc, up to some turn.\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, for example, if we reach at turn T, then H-1 = T - t1, so T = t1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, but a_{t1 + H -1} is taken at turn t1 + H -1, when we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, and after action, y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut since we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, at that turn, before action, we are already at 9, so the action a_{t1 + H -1} could be S or something, but it doesn't affect the position since we are at 9, but we have to specify an action, I suppose.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably reach as soon as possible, so the action at the reach turn might be S or not needed.\n\nIn the direct path, we can reach at turn 17 with y=9.\n\nt1=10, we want y_{10 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence I had, at turn 17, y=9.\n\nSo y_{17} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =17, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =17, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 7: a_{10} to a_{17}? t from 0 to H-1=7, so actions a_{10+0} to a_{10+7} = a_{10} to a_{17}.\n\nBut at turn 17, we take action a_{17}, but y_{17} is already 9, so a_{17} could be S, for example.\n\nIn the path, we need actions from a_{10} to a_{16} to move to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nThen at turn 17, we are at y=9, so for the sequence, we include a_{17}, which can be S, since we are already there.\n\nSimilarly, in general.\n\nFor the direct up path:\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 17, which is t1 +7, so 10 + H -1 =17, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions: from turn 10 to turn 17, but actions at turn 10 to 16 determine y_{11} to y_{17}.\n\nAt turn 10, action a_{10}=U, to go to y=3 at t=11\n\n...\n\nAt turn 16, action a_{16}=U, to go to y=9 at t=17.\n\nThen at turn 17, we are at y=9, so action a_{17} can be S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify a_{t} for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, which is 10 to 17 for H=8.\n\nSo actions: a_{10}=U, a_{11}=U, a_{12}=U, a_{13}=U, a_{14}=U, a_{15}=U, a_{16}=U, a_{17}=S? But a_{17} at turn 17, when we are at y=9, action S keeps it at 9, but we are already there.\n\nSince we reach at turn 17, and we need to specify action at turn 17, it can be S.\n\nBut in terms of min H, H=8 turns, but we reached at turn 17, which is after 7 actions from turn 10.\n\nNumber of turns from start: from turn 10 to turn 17, that's 8 turns, but at turn 10 we start, after 7 actions we reach at turn 17.\n\nBut with H=8, we have 8 actions, but the position is reached at turn 17 after 7 actions.\n\nI think I need to accept the definition.\n\nLet's set T_reach = t1 + H -1\n\nWith T_reach=17.\n\nThen H-1 = T_reach - t1 =7, so H=8.\n\nActions: a_{t} for t from t1 to t1 + H -1 =10 to 17.\n\nBut a_{t} for t=10 to 16 affect the move to y=9 at t=17, and a_{17} at t=17 when we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the path above, with all U from a_{10} to a_{16}, and a_{17} can be S.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 13, y=5 at T=13, which is safe, as we said.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=5 is unsafe at T=12, but at T=13 it is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at no point are we on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nSpecifically, at T=12, we are at y=4, which is safe, not y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=12, but we are at y=4 at T=12.\n\nThen at T=13, y=5, but T=13 is not unsafe for y=5, only T=12 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, other points are safe.\n\nBut what about later unsafe times, like y=1 at T=15, but we are at y=7 at T=15, not on y=1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can we reach y=9 before turn 17?\n\nFrom y=2, min increase is 7, so if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 10: y=2\n\nAfter 1 up: t11 y=3\n\nt12 y=4\n\nt13 y=5\n\nt14 y=6\n\nt15 y=7\n\nt16 y=8\n\nt17 y=9\n\nSo earliest possible is turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 16, y=8, which is safe at T=16, as above.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? No, because we need 7 steps up.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per up.\n\nSo min reach turn is 17.\n\nBut in this path, it works, as we checked.\n\nBut earlier I thought about T=12 for y=5, but we are not on y=5 at T=12.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the action at turn where we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=8, actions from a_{10} to a_{17}.\n\na_{10} to a_{16} should be U, and a_{17} can be S, since we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions to reach\", and when we are at (0,9), we don't need to move, but we have to specify the action for that turn.\n\nPerhaps we can have a_{17} as S.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince we reach at turn 17, and we need to include action at turn 17, but it doesn't affect the position if we stay.\n\nNow, but in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in this case, with all U from t=10 to t=16, and S at t=17.\n\nBut t=17 is part of the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 17 with no action at t=17, but the sequence includes up to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 15, y=7, which is safe, but y=7 was unsafe at T=11, but T=15 is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there any issue at other points?\n\nWhat about y=3 and y=4 at T=14,15.\n\nIn our path, at T=14, we are at y=6, not y=3 or 4.\n\nAt T=15, at y=7.\n\ny=3 unsafe at T=14,15, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 unsafe at T=15,16,17, but at T=15 we are at y=7, T=16 at y=8, T=17 at y=9, all not on y=1 or 2.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, this path works with H=8, reaching at turn 17.\n\nBut H=8, and min number of turns.\n\nCan we do with fewer turns? H smaller?\n\nIf H=7, then T_reach = t1 + H -1 =10 +7 -1=16.\n\nSo y_{16}=9.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 10, to y=9 at turn 16, that requires increasing by 7 in 6 turns? From turn 10 to turn 16, that's 6 steps: actions at t=10 to t=15 affect y_{11} to y_{16}.\n\ny_{11} to y_{16}, 6 positions.\n\nStart at y_{10}=2, after a_{10}, y_{11}, ..., after a_{15}, y_{16}.\n\nWe want y_{16}=9.\n\ny_{16} = y_{10} + sum of Δy from t=10 to 15.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nTo go from 2 to 9, need +7, so sum Δy = +7.\n\nWith 6 actions (t=10 to 15), the max sum is +6, if all U, then y_{16} = 2 +6 =8, not 9.\n\ny_{10}=2, after 6 up moves, y_{16}=2+6=8, which is less than 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in 6 steps from y=2; min steps is 7, to reach at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, with H=7, T_reach=16, y_{16}=9 impossible from y_{10}=2 in 6 actions.\n\nThus min H=8, with reach at turn 17.\n\nBut in the action sequence, with H=8, actions at t=10 to t=17.\n\nNow, for t=10 to 16, we need to set actions to move up.\n\nSpecifically:\n\na_{10} = U: to go from y=2 to y=3 at t=11\n\na_{11} = U: to y=4 at t=12\n\na_{12} = U: to y=5 at t=13\n\na_{13} = U: to y=6 at t=14\n\na_{14} = U: to y=7 at t=15\n\na_{15} = U: to y=8 at t=16\n\na_{16} = U: to y=9 at t=17\n\nThen at t=17, we are at y=9, so a_{17} can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to include a_{17}.\n\nBut the position is reached at t=17, before a_{17} is taken.\n\nAfter a_{16}, we are at y=9 at t=17.\n\nThen at t=17, we take a_{17}, which could be S, so y_{18}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, we should list the actions from t=10 to t=17.\n\nNow, but in this case, at t=13, we are at y=5 at T=13, which is safe.\n\nBut is there any reason to go slower? No, since we can go directly.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=5 unsafe at T=12, but we are not on it at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 5 at T=12.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=12.\n\nIn our path, at T=12, we are at y=4, not on y=5.\n\nAt T=13, y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid y=5 entirely, but not necessary.\n\nSince y=6 has unsafe times late, but we pass through early when safe.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6, there is a car, but unsafe at T=24-27, which is after, so no problem.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I thought about y=7 and y=8 at T=11, but we are not near there at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, we are at y=3 if we go up.\n\ny=3 at T=11 is safe.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nSo minimal H is 8, with actions: U from t=10 to t=16, and S at t=17.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=10 to 16, U, and t=17 S.\n\nBut at t=17, we are already at y=9, so S is fine.\n\nSince we reach at t=17, and the action at t=17 is after, but we have to include it.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can have a shorter sequence by going down or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0, it takes turns and we need to come back, so H larger.\n\nSimilarly, staying also increases H.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 5, at T=12, unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the position at each turn for this sequence:\n\nTurn 10: y=2, action U\n\nTurn 11: y=3, action U\n\nTurn 12: y=4, action U\n\nTurn 13: y=5, action U  // at T=13, y=5, freeway 5, is it safe?\n\nAt T=13, for freeway 5, cars: let's verify.\n\nAt t=10, freeway 5 cars: (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: for each.\n\nFirst car: at T, [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT] with ΔT=T-10\n\nAt T=13, ΔT=3, span [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT] at ΔT=3, [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], which includes 0? [1,12], 1 to 12, so x=0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0, so 0 not included.\n\n0 in [a,b] if a≤0≤b.\n\nHere a=1>0, so 0 not ≤ a? a=1, b=12, 0 < a, so not in span.\n\nThird car: [49+36,60+36]=[85,96], no.\n\nSo at T=13, no car covers 0 on y=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, ΔT=2, second car: [-35+24, -24+24]=[-11,0], now -11≤0≤0, yes, 0≤0 is true, so 0 is included, so unsafe.\n\nBut we are not on y=5 at T=12.\n\nIn our sequence, at T=12, y=4.\n\ny=4 at T=12: freeway 4 cars at t=10: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nAt T=12, ΔT=2, first car: [-35 +6*2, -24 +12] = [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\nSecond: [43+12,54+12]=[55,66], no\n\nThird: [7+12,18+12]=[19,30], no\n\nSo safe.\n\nOther points similar.\n\nThus the path is valid.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8, with actions: U at each turn from 10 to 16, and S at 17.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to output for each turn.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: S\n}\n\nBut H=8, turns from 10 to 17.\n\nSince we reach at turn 17, and action at turn 17 is S.\n\nBut perhaps we can have no action at turn 17, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 17, if we do nothing, but we have to specify action.\n\nS is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by moving faster, but impossible.\n\nOr by using down to avoid, but not necessary and takes more time.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, it has a car that will be unsafe later, but we pass early.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 10 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway y (where 1 ≤ y ≤ 8) at a turn T and, for that freeway, there is a car such that x=0 is within its span at turn T.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway, derived from the car states at turn 10, are as follows:\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at turns 15, 16, 17\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at turns 15, 16, 17\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at turns 14, 15\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at turns 14, 15\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at turn 12\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at turns 24, 25, 26, 27\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at turn 11\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at turn 11\n\nThe minimal number of turns to reach y=9 from y=2 is 7 moves upward, as each \"U\" action increases y by 1. Starting at turn 10 with y=2:\n- After one \"U\": turn 11, y=3\n- After two \"U\": turn 12, y=4\n- After three \"U\": turn 13, y=5\n- After four \"U\": turn 14, y=6\n- After five \"U\": turn 15, y=7\n- After six \"U\": turn 16, y=8\n- After seven \"U\": turn 17, y=9\n\nThus, the player reaches y=9 at turn 17. The minimal number of turns H is 8, as y_{10 + H - 1} = y_{17} = 9, so H - 1 = 7 and H = 8.\n\nThe sequence of actions must be specified for turns t=10 to t=17 (t from 0 to H-1 = 7). For turns 10 to 16, \"U\" actions are required to move upward. At turn 17, the player is already at y=9, so the action can be \"S\" (stay).\n\nVerification of collision avoidance:\n- Turn 10 (y=2): Freeway 2 is safe at T=10 (unsafe at 15-17).\n- Turn 11 (y=3): Freeway 3 is safe at T=11 (unsafe at 14-15).\n- Turn 12 (y=4): Freeway 4 is safe at T=12 (unsafe at 14-15).\n- Turn 13 (y=5): Freeway 5 is safe at T=13 (unsafe only at T=12).\n- Turn 14 (y=6): Freeway 6 is safe at T=14 (unsafe at 24-27).\n- Turn 15 (y=7): Freeway 7 is safe at T=15 (unsafe only at T=11).\n- Turn 16 (y=8): Freeway 8 is safe at T=16 (unsafe only at T=11).\n- Turn 17 (y=9): Not a freeway, always safe.\n\nAll positions are safe at their respective turns. No shorter sequence is possible, as reaching y=9 from y=2 requires at least 7 upward moves, and turn 17 is the earliest possible arrival.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 10: U\n- Turn 11: U\n- Turn 12: U\n- Turn 13: U\n- Turn 14: U\n- Turn 15: U\n- Turn 16: U\n- Turn 17: S\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 10\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17\\text{: } S }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 11. The player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\n The grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. We start at y=3 and want to get to y=9.\n\n Important: \n - The player updates at each turn: \n      U: y += 1\n      D: y -= 1\n      S: y remains\n\n - The player must not be on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway at that turn T such that 0 (the x-coordinate) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\n - Note: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, at turn T the player is still on the original row (y) and then at turn T+1, the player is on the new row (y+1 or y-1). Therefore, when we move at turn T, we are only at risk of collision on the row we are leaving at turn T and the row we are arriving at turn T+1? Actually, the problem states:\n\n   \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\n   And note: when we move at turn T, at turn T we are at y_T (the current row) and then at turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1} (the next row). So at each turn T, we are present at one row: the row we are at at the beginning of the turn (and after the action, we move to the next row for the next turn).\n\n   Therefore, when we are at turn T, we are at row y_T. We must avoid collision on that row at that turn.\n\n   However, note that if we are moving, then at turn T we are at row y_T and we check for cars on row y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, we are at row y_{T+1} and we check for cars on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\n - The cars move continuously: for a car on a freeway, at any future turn T (relative to t1=11), we can compute its span.\n\n   We are at turn t1 = 11. For a future turn T (T>=11), the car's position at turn T is:\n\n      If left-moving: [h - s*(T-11), tau - s*(T-11)]\n      But note: the problem says for left-moving: initially [h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> so if the car is moving left, the head and tail are moving left.\n\n      However, in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\". So for right-moving cars:\n\n          initial span at t1: [tau, h] (note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n      But wait, in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, freeway 1: (-16,-27,right,4). \n\n      For a right-moving car, the head is the front? and tail is the back? The problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning from tail to head? So in this example, at t1=11, the car is from -27 to -16? But note: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\", and for right-moving, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? Then the span is [tail, head] = [-27, -16]? But the problem writes it as (head, tail) = (-16, -27). So head = -16, tail = -27. Then the span is [tail, head] = [-27, -16]? \n\n      However, the update rule for right-moving: \n          Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n      So for the car at freeway 1: (head=-16, tail=-27, right, speed=4) at t1=11.\n\n          At T: \n             tail_T = -27 + 4*(T-11)\n             head_T = -16 + 4*(T-11)\n\n      We need to check at a turn T if 0 is in [tail_T, head_T]? \n\n      But note: the problem says the car is on the freeway and we check at turn T if 0 is in the span. \n\n      Also note: the grid is infinite in x? But we only care about when the car covers x=0.\n\n Plan:\n\n We need to compute for each freeway (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (in terms of turns T) during which the car covers x=0.\n\n Specifically, for a car (tail, head, d, s) at freeway k, we compute the set of T (T>=11) such that:\n\n      tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11)   [for right-moving]\n\n But note: in the representation, we have head and tail. For the car (-16,-27,right,4): \n\n      tail = -27, head = -16.\n\n      Condition: -27 + 4*(T-11) <= 0 <= -16 + 4*(T-11)\n\n      Solve:\n\n        Lower bound: -27 + 4*(T-11) <= 0  => 4*(T-11) <= 27 => T-11 <= 27/4 = 6.75 => T <= 17.75 -> so T<=17 (since T integer) is safe for the lower bound? Actually, we require 0 to be at least the tail. But note: the condition is that 0 must be in [tail_T, head_T]. So:\n\n           tail_T = -27 + 4*(T-11)\n           head_T = -16 + 4*(T-11)\n\n           Condition: tail_T <= 0 <= head_T\n\n        =>  -27 + 4*(T-11) <= 0  and  0 <= -16 + 4*(T-11)\n\n        First inequality: 4*(T-11) <= 27  -> T-11 <= 6.75 -> T <= 17.75 -> T<=17\n        Second inequality: 4*(T-11) >= 16  -> T-11 >= 4 -> T>=15\n\n        So the car blocks freeway 1 at T=15,16,17.\n\n Similarly, we can compute for every car.\n\n However, note that the freeway is fixed for each car. We are only concerned with the freeway we are on at a given turn.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of turns T (T>=11) when the car covers x=0.\n\n 2. We are going to simulate the player moving from y=3 at turn 11 to y=9. We can only move one step per turn (or stay). We want the minimal H.\n\n 3. We must avoid being at a freeway k (which is from 1 to 8) at a turn T if at that turn T, freeway k is blocked by any car (i.e., there is at least one car on freeway k that covers x=0 at T).\n\n 4. Note: when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1-8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\n 5. We start at turn 11 at y=3. We are on freeway 3 at turn 11? We must check if freeway 3 is blocked at turn 11.\n\n 6. We need to compute the blocking times for each freeway.\n\n Let's compute the blocking intervals for each freeway:\n\n Freeway 1: \n    Cars: \n        (-16, -27, right, 4) -> [tail=-27, head=-16] -> \n            T in [ ceil( (0+27)/4 + 11 ), floor( (0+16)/4 + 11 ) ]? \n\n        Condition: \n            -27 + 4*(T-11) <= 0  => T-11 <= 27/4 = 6.75 => T <= 17.75 -> T<=17\n            -16 + 4*(T-11) >= 0  => T-11 >= 16/4 = 4 -> T>=15\n\n        So T=15,16,17.\n\n        Car 2: (20,9,right,4) -> wait, head=20, tail=9? But the representation is (head, tail) so head=20, tail=9? \n            Then condition: \n                9 + 4*(T-11) <= 0 <= 20 + 4*(T-11)\n\n            First: 9+4*(T-11) <=0 -> 4*(T-11)<=-9 -> T-11<=-9/4 -> T<=11-2.25=8.75 -> T<=8 -> but T>=11 -> no solution? \n            Second: 0<=20+4*(T-11) -> always true for T>=11? \n\n            Actually, if tail=9 and head=20, then the car is from 9 to 20. Then at T=11: [9+0,20+0] = [9,20] -> doesn't cover 0? And as T increases, the car moves right. So never covers 0? \n\n            So we only need the first car? \n\n        Let me check: \n            For car (20,9,right,4): \n                tail_T = 9 + 4*(T-11)\n                head_T = 20 + 4*(T-11)\n\n            We require tail_T <= 0 <= head_T -> \n                9+4*(T-11) <= 0 -> 4*(T-11) <= -9 -> T-11 <= -2.25 -> T<=8.75 -> but T>=11 -> impossible.\n\n        Similarly, the third car: (56,45,right,4) -> \n                tail_T = 45 + 4*(T-11)\n                head_T = 56 + 4*(T-11)\n            Both are positive and increasing -> never covers 0.\n\n        So only the first car on freeway 1 blocks at T=15,16,17.\n\n Freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n        Cars: same as freeway 1 -> so also only the first car blocks at T=15,16,17.\n\n Freeway 3:\n        Cars: \n            (-18,-29,right,6) -> tail=-29, head=-18\n                Condition: \n                    -29+6*(T-11) <= 0 -> 6*(T-11)<=29 -> T-11<=29/6≈4.833 -> T<=15.833 -> T<=15\n                    -18+6*(T-11)>=0 -> 6*(T-11)>=18 -> T-11>=3 -> T>=14\n                So T=14,15.\n\n            (60,49,right,6) -> tail=49, head=60 -> both positive and increasing -> never covers 0.\n            (24,13,right,6) -> tail=13, head=24 -> \n                13+6*(T-11)<=0 -> T-11<=-13/6≈-2.16 -> impossible.\n\n        So freeway 3 blocked at T=14,15.\n\n Freeway 4: same as freeway 3? -> blocked at T=14,15.\n\n Freeway 5:\n        Cars: \n            (24,13,right,12) -> tail=13, head=24 -> \n                13+12*(T-11)<=0 -> T-11<=-13/12 -> impossible.\n            (-12,-23,right,12) -> tail=-23, head=-12\n                Condition:\n                    -23+12*(T-11)<=0 -> 12*(T-11)<=23 -> T-11<=23/12≈1.916 -> T<=12.916 -> T<=12\n                    -12+12*(T-11)>=0 -> 12*(T-11)>=12 -> T-11>=1 -> T>=12\n                So T=12? \n            (-48,-59,right,12) -> tail=-59, head=-48\n                Condition:\n                    -59+12*(T-11)<=0 -> 12*(T-11)<=59 -> T-11<=59/12≈4.916 -> T<=15.916 -> T<=15\n                    -48+12*(T-11)>=0 -> 12*(T-11)>=48 -> T-11>=4 -> T>=15\n                So T=15.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 5 is blocked at T=12 (by the second car) and T=15 (by the third car).\n\n Freeway 6:\n        Only one car: (-39,-50,right,3) -> tail=-50, head=-39\n            Condition:\n                -50+3*(T-11)<=0 -> 3*(T-11)<=50 -> T-11<=50/3≈16.666 -> T<=27.666 -> T<=27\n                -39+3*(T-11)>=0 -> 3*(T-11)>=39 -> T-11>=13 -> T>=24\n            So blocked at T=24,25,26,27.\n\n Freeway 7:\n        (0,-23,right,24) -> tail=-23, head=0? \n            Condition: \n                -23+24*(T-11)<=0 -> 24*(T-11)<=23 -> T-11<=23/24≈0.958 -> T<=11.958 -> T<=11\n                0+24*(T-11)>=0 -> always true for T>=11.\n            So at T=11: \n                tail_T = -23 + 24*(0) = -23\n                head_T = 0 + 24*(0) = 0\n            So 0 is in [tail_T, head_T]? -> yes, because [ -23, 0 ] includes 0.\n\n            Therefore, freeway 7 is blocked at T=11? \n\n            But wait, T=11: \n                T-11=0 -> so the car is at [-23,0] at T=11. So at T=11, freeway 7 is blocked.\n\n            What about T=12?\n                tail_T = -23+24=1\n                head_T = 0+24=24\n                Then 0 is not in [1,24] -> not blocked.\n\n            So only T=11 is blocked? \n\n        But note: the problem says the car is represented as (head, tail, direction, speed). Here: head=0, tail=-23? Then the span at T=11 is [tail, head] = [-23,0]. So 0 is included.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 7 is blocked only at T=11.\n\n Freeway 8:\n        Same as freeway 7: (0,-23,right,24) -> so blocked at T=11.\n\n Summary of blocked freeways by turn:\n\n   Turn 11: freeways 7 and 8 are blocked.\n   Turn 12: freeway 5 is blocked (by the second car: T=12) and freeway 5? only at T=12? \n        But also, freeway 5: we found T=12 and T=15. At T=12: freeway 5 is blocked.\n\n   Turn 14: freeways 3 and 4 are blocked.\n   Turn 15: freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are blocked (freeway 5 has a car at T=15, freeways 1 and 2 at T=15,16,17; freeways 3,4 at T=14,15; freeway 5 at T=15).\n   Turn 16: freeways 1 and 2 are blocked.\n   Turn 17: freeways 1 and 2 are blocked.\n\n   Also, freeway 6 is blocked at T=24,25,26,27 (but we hope to finish before that).\n\n We start at turn 11 at y=3. We cannot be at freeway 7 or 8 at turn 11? But we are at freeway 3 at turn 11? \n\n   We are at y=3 at turn 11. Freeway 3 is not blocked at turn 11? (we computed freeway 3 blocked at T=14,15). So we are safe at turn 11.\n\n However, note that freeway 7 and 8 are blocked at turn 11, but we are not on them. So we are safe.\n\n We must plan a path from y=3 to y=9 in minimal turns, avoiding:\n\n   - At any turn T, if we are at a freeway k (1<=k<=8) and k is blocked at turn T, then we crash.\n\n   We can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\n We are at turn 11, y=3.\n\n We want to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 6 (since 9-3=6, so 6 moves upward). But we have obstacles.\n\n We must avoid:\n\n   Turn 11: y=7 and y=8 are blocked -> so we cannot be at y=7 or 8 at turn 11? But we are at y=3.\n\n   Turn 12: freeway 5 (which is y=5) is blocked -> so we cannot be at y=5 at turn 12.\n\n   Turn 14: freeways 3 and 4 (y=3 and y=4) are blocked -> so we cannot be at y=3 or 4 at turn 14.\n   Turn 15: freeways 1,2,3,4,5 (y=1,2,3,4,5) are blocked -> so we cannot be at y=1 to 5 at turn 15.\n   Turn 16: freeways 1 and 2 (y=1 and 2) are blocked -> so we cannot be at y=1 or 2 at turn 16.\n\n We must plan the moves:\n\n   We have to get from y=3 (turn11) to y=9 (as soon as possible).\n\n   We can move up, down, or stay. We want minimal H.\n\n   We note that we can also wait (stay) to avoid being at a blocked freeway at a bad turn.\n\n   Since we are at y=3 at turn11, and we want to get to y=9, we must move up at least 6 times.\n\n   The minimal H is at least 6 (if we do 6 ups: then H=6 turns: from turn11 to turn16 we would be at y=3,4,5,6,7,8, and then at turn16 we are at y=8? and then we need one more to get to y=9? \n\n        Actually, if we do:\n          turn11: U -> at turn12: y=4\n          turn12: U -> turn13: y=5\n          turn13: U -> turn14: y=6\n          turn14: U -> turn15: y=7\n          turn15: U -> turn16: y=8\n          turn16: U -> turn17: y=9\n\n        So at turn17 we are at y=9. But we must check the safety at each turn:\n\n          At turn11: we are at y=3 -> safe (freeway3 is not blocked at turn11).\n          At turn12: we are at y=4 -> freeway4: blocked at T=14,15? not at T=12 -> safe? \n                But wait: freeway4 blocked at T=14,15 -> so at T=12, freeway4 is not blocked -> safe.\n          At turn13: we are at y=5 -> freeway5: we must check if freeway5 is blocked at turn13.\n                We computed freeway5 blocked at T=12 and T=15. Turn13 is not blocked -> safe.\n          At turn14: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: blocked only at T=24+ -> safe.\n          At turn15: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: we computed freeway7 blocked only at T=11 -> so at T=15, freeway7 is not blocked -> safe.\n          At turn16: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: blocked only at T=11 -> safe.\n\n        So this path (6 ups) would get us to y=9 at turn17? But wait, at turn16 we are at y=8, and then we move up at turn16 to get to y=9 at turn17.\n\n        However, note that at turn17 we are at y=9 -> which is safe (no freeway). But we are required to be at (0,9) at the last action? Actually, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn17? \n\n        The problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n          Our sequence: \n            Turn11: U -> at the end of turn11, we are at y=4? \n            But note: the position at turn T is the position at the beginning of the turn. \n\n          The state at the beginning of turn11: (0,3)\n          Then we choose a_{11}=U -> at the beginning of turn12: y=4.\n\n          So at the beginning of turn17: we are at y=8, then we do a_{16}=U -> at the beginning of turn17: y=9.\n\n          So we need to have H=6? because we do 6 actions: at turn11,12,13,14,15,16 -> H=6, and then at the beginning of turn17 we are at y=9.\n\n          But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1. So we do actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H we are at the new state? \n\n          Actually, the player update: \n                y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n          So after H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1), we have moved H steps and the position is at turn t1+H.\n\n          We require that at turn t1+H-1 (the last action) we end at (0,9)? \n\n          But note: the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" -> no, it says: \"a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\n          Actually, the minimal H is the minimal number of turns (actions) such that after the last action we are at (0,9). \n\n          So if we do 6 actions: \n            turn11: U -> y12 = 4\n            turn12: U -> y13 = 5\n            turn13: U -> y14 = 6\n            turn14: U -> y15 = 7\n            turn15: U -> y16 = 8\n            turn16: U -> y17 = 9\n\n          Then at turn17 (which is the state after the last action at turn16) we are at (0,9). So we did 6 actions (H=6) and we are done.\n\n          But let me check the safety at the intermediate states:\n\n            Turn11: we are at y=3 (beginning of turn11) -> we do U -> then at the end of the action we move to y=4? \n                    But the collision check: at turn11, we are at y=3 -> so we check freeway3 at turn11 -> safe.\n\n            Then at the beginning of turn12: we are at y=4 -> we do U -> then we check: at turn12 we are at y=4 -> freeway4 at turn12: safe (because freeway4 blocked only at 14,15).\n\n            Turn13: we are at y=5 -> check freeway5 at turn13: safe? because freeway5 blocked at T=12 and T=15 -> so turn13 is safe.\n\n            Turn14: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: safe (blocked at T>=24).\n\n            Turn15: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: safe (only blocked at T=11).\n\n            Turn16: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\n          So it seems we can do it in 6 moves.\n\n        However, wait: at turn12 we are at y=4 (freeway4) at turn12 -> safe. But what about turn12: freeway5 is blocked? But we are not on freeway5 at turn12. We are on freeway4 at turn12.\n\n        So the path is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence:\n\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n          Turn13: U\n          Turn14: U\n          Turn15: U\n          Turn16: U\n\n        And we are done in 6 turns.\n\n But wait: what about the blocked freeway5 at turn12? We are at y=4 at turn12, so we are on freeway4, not freeway5. So we are safe.\n\n However, let me double-check freeway5 at turn12: we said freeway5 is blocked at turn12? Then if we were at freeway5 (y=5) at turn12, we would crash. But we are at y=4.\n\n So this path is safe.\n\n But note: we start at y=3 at turn11. We do U at turn11 -> then at turn12 we are at y=4. \n\n However, there is a problem: at turn12, freeway5 (y=5) is blocked. But we are not on freeway5. We are on freeway4. So safe.\n\n Now, is there a path that takes less than 6 moves? \n\n   The minimal number of moves is 6 (because we have to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps). So 6 is minimal.\n\n Therefore, we can use 6 moves.\n\n But wait: what if we do a double move? We can only move one step per turn. So 6 is the minimum.\n\n However, note that we might be forced to wait? But in this case we don't have to wait.\n\n But wait: what about turn15? We are at y=7 at turn15 -> safe. But what if we tried to be at y=5 at turn12? that would crash? but we avoid that by not being at y=5 at turn12.\n\n So the plan is safe.\n\n But wait: at turn11, we are at y=3. Then we do U to go to y=4 at turn12. But what if we do S at turn11? then we stay at y=3 at turn12. Then we have to do 6 moves from turn12 onward? that would take 7 moves. So worse.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\n However, let me reexamine the blocking at freeway5 at turn12: \n\n        Freeway5 (which is y=5) is blocked at turn12. So we must avoid being at y=5 at turn12.\n\n        In our plan, we are at y=4 at turn12 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn13, we move to y=5. Is freeway5 blocked at turn13? We computed: freeway5 is blocked at T=12 and T=15. So turn13 is safe.\n\n        Then at turn14: we move to y=6 -> safe.\n\n        Then turn15: we are at y=7 -> safe.\n\n        Then turn16: y=8 -> safe.\n\n        Then turn17: we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\n So the sequence:\n\n   Turn11: U\n   Turn12: U\n   Turn13: U\n   Turn14: U\n   Turn15: U\n   Turn16: U\n\n But wait, after 6 actions we have:\n\n      Start: turn11: y=3 -> after U: at turn12: y=4\n      turn12: U -> turn13: y=5\n      turn13: U -> turn14: y=6\n      turn14: U -> turn15: y=7\n      turn15: U -> turn16: y=8\n      turn16: U -> turn17: y=9\n\n So we have reached y=9 at turn17, which is after 6 actions (from turn11 to turn16). \n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   Turn 11: U\n   Turn 12: U\n   Turn 13: U\n   Turn 14: U\n   Turn 15: U\n   Turn 16: U\n\n But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1. So we have t=0,1,...,5 -> 6 actions.\n\n However, we must check if there is any danger we overlooked.\n\n Specifically, at turn13 we are at y=5. We must check the cars on freeway5 at turn13:\n\n        Freeway5 has three cars. We computed that freeway5 is only blocked at T=12 and T=15. At T=13, none of the cars cover 0? \n\n        Let's verify for the car that blocked at T=12: the second car: (-12,-23,right,12) at freeway5.\n            At T=12: \n                tail_T = -23 + 12*(12-11) = -23+12 = -11\n                head_T = -12 + 12 = 0\n            So at T=12, the car is from -11 to 0 -> covers 0? yes, at the head (0) -> so blocked.\n\n            At T=13:\n                tail_T = -23 + 12*(2) = -23+24=1\n                head_T = -12+24=12\n            -> [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n        The other car that blocks at T=15: the third car: (-48,-59,right,12) \n            At T=15: \n                tail_T = -59 + 12*(4) = -59+48 = -11\n                head_T = -48+48=0 -> covers 0? at the head (0) -> blocked.\n            At T=13:\n                tail_T = -59 + 12*(2) = -59+24=-35\n                head_T = -48+24=-24\n            -> [-35,-24] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n        The first car: (24,13,right,12) -> never covers 0.\n\n        So indeed freeway5 is safe at T=13.\n\n Therefore, the plan is safe.\n\n However, note that we are at freeway5 at turn13? Yes, because we are at y=5 at turn13. And freeway5 is safe at turn13.\n\n But what about the car that was at freeway5 at turn12? It was at [-11,0] at turn12. Then at turn13 it moves to [1,12]. We are at turn13 at (0,5): we are at x=0? and the car on freeway5 at turn13 is at [1,12] -> doesn't cover x=0. So safe.\n\n So we are confident.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are only on y_T. So we are safe.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\n However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6.\n\n But wait: could we get there earlier? \n\n   We start at turn11 at y=3. The earliest we can be at y=9 is after 6 moves, so at turn17. \n\n   So H=6 is minimal.\n\n But what if we do a move that is not upward? For instance, if we go down to y=2 at turn11? Then we would need 7 moves to get to 9? that would be worse.\n\n So we have the minimal.\n\n But note: there is a potential issue at turn15: we are at y=7. What if there was a car at freeway7 at turn15? We computed freeway7 only blocked at turn11. But let me check freeway7 at turn15:\n\n        The car on freeway7: (0,-23,right,24)\n        At turn15: \n            tail_T = -23 + 24*(15-11) = -23 + 24*4 = -23+96 = 73\n            head_T = 0 + 96 = 96\n        So the car is at [73,96] -> not covering 0.\n\n        Similarly, freeway8: same car? but the freeway8 car is the same: (0,-23,right,24) -> same calculation -> not covering 0.\n\n So safe.\n\n Therefore, the solution is the 6 consecutive Ups.\n\n However, note: the problem has freeway6 blocked at later turns (24,25,26,27) but we are done by turn17.\n\n So we output the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 6. The sequence of actions is determined by moving upward (U) at each turn to increment the y-coordinate by 1 per turn, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 11 (y=3)**: Freeway 3 is blocked at turns 14 and 15, but not at turn 11. Safe.\n- **Turn 12 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 is blocked at turns 14 and 15, but not at turn 12. Freeway 5 is blocked at turn 12, but the player is on freeway 4, not freeway 5. Safe.\n- **Turn 13 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 is blocked at turns 12 and 15, but not at turn 13. Safe.\n- **Turn 14 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 is blocked at turns 24–27, but not at turn 14. Safe.\n- **Turn 15 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 is blocked only at turn 11, not at turn 15. Safe.\n- **Turn 16 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 is blocked only at turn 11, not at turn 16. Safe.\n\nAfter 6 actions (turns 11 to 16), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17. This is the minimal \\(H\\) as moving upward without delay is the fastest path, and no shorter path exists (6 steps are required to move from y=3 to y=9).\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, so I have to consider their positions at each turn.\n\nFirst, the player update: at each turn, I can go up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since I start at y=4 and need to get to y=9, I need to go up, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at that turn, there is a car where the span includes 0. The span is the position of the car, and since the cars are on the x-axis, but we're only concerned with x=0 because that's where the player is.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, so we only care if a car's span includes x=0 at the turn when the player is on that y-level.\n\nAlso, important: when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I choose an action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, collision is checked only for the current y at each turn. When I'm at y_T at turn T, I check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T to see if 0 is in any span.\n\nIf I move vertically, at turn T, I'm on y_T, so I check y_T cars. Then after the move, at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1}, and I check y_{T+1} cars.\n\nNow, the cars: each has head, tail, direction, speed. Direction: right means moving right, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h] and it moves right, so at time T, position is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)].\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would be [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)], but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4)\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the span: for right-moving, it says [τ, h] → [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] → [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt], but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for k=1: (-12,-23,right,4). -12 and -23, but if right-moving, tail should be less than head? -23 is less than -12, so tail τ = -23, head h = -12? But in the notation, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), but for right-moving, h should be greater than τ.\n\nHere: (-12, -23, right, 4). -12 > -23, so h = -12, τ = -23? But in the span definition, for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the car update: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nSo for a car, head and tail: for right-moving, since it moves right, head is the front, so h > τ, and span is from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly for left, h < τ, span from h to τ.\n\nBut in this data, all directions are right, so for each, h > τ, since for example, (-12, -23, right, 4), -12 > -23, so h=-12, τ=-23.\n\nSimilarly, (24,13,right,4), 24>13, h=24, τ=13.\n\n(60,49,right,4), 60>49, h=60, τ=49.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, t1 is current turn, which is 12.\n\nSo at any future turn T, the span for a car is [τ + s*(T - 12), h + s*(T - 12)] for right-moving cars.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the freeway y that I'm on, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\n0 ∈ [τ + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)] for some car on y.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I think.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=4 to y=9, minimizing H, the number of turns.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, I take actions, and at turn t1 + H -1, I reach y=9.\n\nStart at turn t1=12, position y=4.\n\nAfter one action, at turn 13, I am at y= something, depending on action at turn 12.\n\nGenerally, at turn T, I am at position y_T, which depends on previous actions.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I need to go up, and H minimal, probably I should go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the freeways and their cars, and for each, when is 0 in the span for turns T >=12.\n\nFreeway y=1: cars: (h,τ,d,s) = (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4)\n\nFor first car: τ = -23, h = -12, s=4, right\n\nSpan at T: [τ + 4*(T-12), h + 4*(T-12)] = [-23 + 4(T-12), -12 + 4(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=13, h=24, s=4, [13 + 4(T-12), 24 + 4(T-12)]\n\nThird car: τ=49, h=60, s=4, [49 + 4(T-12), 60 + 4(T-12)]\n\nNow, 0 in span for first car if -23 +4(T-12) <= 0 <= -12 +4(T-12)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet dt = T-12, so for dt >=0.\n\nFirst car: -23 +4dt <= 0 <= -12 +4dt\n\nSo -23 +4dt <=0 and 0 <= -12 +4dt\n\nFrom -23 +4dt <=0: 4dt <=23, dt <= 23/4 = 5.75, so dt <=5 since dt integer? Turns are discrete, so T integer, dt integer.\n\nT is turn number, so integer, dt integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -12 +4dt => 4dt >=12, dt >=3.\n\nSo for first car, collision when dt >=3 and dt <=5, i.e., T=15,16,17? dt=T-12, so for T=12+3=15, T=12+4=16, T=12+5=17.\n\ndt=3: T=15, -23+4*3= -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\ndt=4: -23+16= -7, -12+16=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\ndt=5: -23+20= -3, -12+20=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\ndt=6: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, dt=2: -23+8= -15, -12+8= -4, [ -15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=15,16,17 for first car.\n\nBut there are multiple cars.\n\nSecond car on y=1: τ=13, h=24, s=4\n\n[13 +4dt, 24 +4dt]\n\n0 in this? 13+4dt <=0 <=24+4dt? 13+4dt <=0 implies 4dt <= -13, impossible since dt>=0, so 13+4dt >=13>0, so 0 never in [13+4dt,24+4dt] for dt>=0. So no collision ever from this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: [49+4dt,60+4dt], all positive and increasing, min at dt=0: 49 to 60, >0, so never 0. No issue.\n\nSo for freeway y=1, only the first car causes collision at T=15,16,17.\n\nNow freeway y=2: same cars as y=1? According to table:\n\ny=2: (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4) — identical to y=1.\n\nSo same as above, collision only at T=15,16,17.\n\nNow y=3: cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as before but s=6? (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nτ=-23, h=-12, s=6\n\nSpan: [-23 +6dt, -12 +6dt]\n\n0 in if -23+6dt <=0 <= -12+6dt\n\n-23+6dt <=0 => 6dt <=23, dt <=23/6≈3.833, so dt<=3\n\n0 <= -12+6dt => 6dt >=12, dt>=2\n\nSo dt=2,3\n\nT=14,15? dt=2: T=14, -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\ndt=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\ndt=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=14,15 for first car.\n\nSecond car on y=3: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nτ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nSpan: [-59 +6dt, -48 +6dt]\n\n0 in if -59+6dt <=0 <= -48+6dt\n\n-59+6dt <=0 => 6dt <=59, dt<=59/6≈9.833, dt<=9\n\n0 <= -48+6dt => 6dt >=48, dt>=8\n\nSo for dt=8,9\n\nT=20,21\n\ndt=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\ndt=9: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\ndt=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision at T=20,21\n\nThird car: (30,19,right,6) — h=30, τ=19? 30>19, so [19 +6dt, 30 +6dt]\n\n19+6dt >=19>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in. No collision.\n\nSo for y=3, collisions at T=14,15 from first car, and T=20,21 from second car.\n\nNow y=4: same cars as y=3: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nSo identical to y=3, collision at T=14,15,20,21.\n\nNow y=5: cars: (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=36, τ=25, s=12? 36>25, so [25 +12dt, 36 +12dt]\n\n25+12dt >=25>0, never 0, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), so h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nSpan: [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [-11 +12dt, 0 +12dt] = [-11+12dt, 12dt]\n\n0 in if -11+12dt <=0 <=12dt\n\nBut 0 <=12dt always true for dt>=0.\n\n-11+12dt <=0 => 12dt <=11, dt<=11/12<1, so dt=0 only? dt=0: [-11,0], 0 is included? Since it's [ -11, 0], 0 is the endpoint, so yes, 0 in.\n\ndt=0: T=12, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nBut at T=12, I am at y=4, not on y=5, so for collision, only if I am on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt T=12, I am on y=4, so for y=5, even if car at x=0, I am not there, so no collision.\n\nNow for future turns, dt>=1.\n\ndt=1: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\ndt=0: [-11,0], 0 in, but T=12.\n\nFor T>12, dt>=1, 12dt >=12>0, -11+12dt >=1>0 for dt>=1, so [1,12] etc., 0 not in. So only at T=12, but I'm not on y=5 then.\n\nSo no collision from this car for T>=12? At T=12, the car is at [-11,0], which includes 0, but since I'm not on y=5 at T=12, no collision. For T>12, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-36,-47,right,12), τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nSpan: [-47 +12dt, -36 +12dt]\n\n0 in if -47+12dt <=0 <= -36+12dt\n\n-47+12dt <=0 => 12dt <=47, dt<=47/12≈3.916, dt<=3\n\n0 <= -36+12dt => 12dt >=36, dt>=3\n\nSo dt=3 only.\n\nT=15, span: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\ndt=2: -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in\n\ndt=4: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision only at T=15 for this car.\n\nBut on y=5.\n\nNow, for y=5, from above:\n\nFirst car: no collision\n\nSecond car: collision only at T=12, but not relevant\n\nThird car: collision at T=15\n\nSo for y=5, collision only at T=15 from third car.\n\nNow y=6: only one car: (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nτ=-47, h=-36, s=3\n\nSpan: [-47 +3dt, -36 +3dt]\n\n0 in if -47+3dt <=0 <= -36+3dt\n\n-47+3dt <=0 => 3dt <=47, dt<=47/3≈15.666, dt<=15\n\n0 <= -36+3dt => 3dt >=36, dt>=12\n\nSo for dt=12 to 15 inclusive.\n\ndt=12: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, [ -11,0]\n\ndt=13: -47+39= -8, -36+39=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\ndt=14: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\ndt=15: -47+45= -2, -36+45=9, [ -2,9], 0 in\n\ndt=16: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision at T=14,15,16,17? dt=12: T=12+12=24, dt=13:T=25, etc.\n\nT=12 + dt.\n\ndt=12: T=24\n\ndt=13: T=25\n\ndt=14: T=26\n\ndt=15: T=27\n\nSo collision at T=24,25,26,27 for y=6.\n\nNow y=7: (24,1,right,24)\n\nh=24, τ=1? 24>1, so [1 +24dt, 24 +24dt]\n\nAt dt=0, [1,24], 1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nFor dt>0, larger, so never 0 in span. No collision.\n\ny=8: same, (24,1,right,24), identical, no collision.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns where collision occurs (for x=0 occupied by car).\n\ny=1: T=15,16,17\n\ny=2: same, T=15,16,17\n\ny=3: T=14,15 (from first car), and T=20,21 (from second car)\n\ny=4: same as y=3, T=14,15,20,21\n\ny=5: T=15 only (from third car)\n\ny=6: T=24,25,26,27\n\ny=7: no collision\n\ny=8: no collision\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, and player at y=0 or y=9 is safe, I assume.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so when on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=12, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so minimum moves: from 4 to 9, difference 5, so at least 5 turns if I go up every time.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it has a car at x=0.\n\nNow, since I start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, I have to pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 to y=9, so I need to be on y=5,6,7,8 at some points.\n\nBut I can stay or move up/down, so I might not need to be on each intermediate level if I jump, but since I move one step at a time, I must visit each y between start and end, but I can skip levels by moving directly, but no, each move changes y by at most 1, so from y=4, to go to y=5, I must go through y=4, then to y=5, etc., so I will be on each integer y from 4 to 9 at some turn.\n\nBut not necessarily; for example, I could go from y=4 to y=5 in one turn, so at that turn, I am on y=4, then after action, at next turn on y=5.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nTo change y, I need multiple turns.\n\nFor instance, at turn 12, I am at y=4.\n\nI choose action: if U, at turn 13, I am at y=5; if S, at turn 13, y=4 still; if D, y=3, but I need to go up, so D might not be good, but to avoid, I might go down temporarily, but since H minimal, probably not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, from y=4, to reach y=9, the minimal path is to go up 5 times, taking 5 turns: at turn 12, action U, turn 13 y=5; U, turn 14 y=6; U, turn 15 y=7; U, turn 16 y=8; U, turn 17 y=9. So at turn 17, I reach y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if at each turn, when I am on a freeway, no collision.\n\ny=4 is a freeway? Freeways y=1 to 8, y=4 is included.\n\nAt turn 12: I am at y=4, which is freeway.\n\nIs there collision at T=12 on y=4?\n\nFrom above, for y=4, collisions at T=14,15,20,21.\n\nAt T=12, no collision listed for y=4. Let me confirm.\n\ny=4 cars: same as y=3, collisions at T=14,15,20,21.\n\nAt T=12, for y=4: the cars, let's compute span.\n\nAt T=12, dt=0.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,6), span [-23, -12], which is [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,6), span [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nThird: (30,19,right,6), [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=12, no collision on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 13, if I go to y=5, but at turn 13, I would be at y=5 if I moved up at turn 12.\n\nIn the sequence: if I do U at turn 12, at turn 13 I am at y=5.\n\nNow, at turn 13, on y=5, is there collision?\n\ny=5 collisions only at T=15, as above.\n\nAt T=13, for y=5: cars?\n\ny=5: (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nAt T=13, dt=1.\n\nFirst car: [25+12*1, 36+12*1] = [37,48], no 0\n\nSecond car: [-11+12*1, 0+12*1] = [1,12], no 0\n\nThird car: [-47+12*1, -36+12*1] = [-35,-24], no 0\n\nSo at T=13, no collision on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=6 at turn 14, etc.\n\nBut let's check the direct path: turn 12: y=4, no collision.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: y=5, no collision (as above).\n\nAction U: to y=6 at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: y=6, now y=6 has collision? From above, y=6 collisions at T=24,25,26,27, which are later, T=14 is early, dt=2 for T=14? T=14, dt=T-12=2.\n\ny=6 car: (-36,-47,right,3), span at dt=2: [-47+3*2, -36+3*2] = [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in. So no collision at T=14.\n\nAction U: to y=7 at turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: y=7, y=7 has no collision, as per above.\n\ny=7 no cars at x=0 ever.\n\nAction U: to y=8 at turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: y=8, no collision.\n\nAction U: to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut at turn 15, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nIn this path, at turn 15, I am on y=7, not on y=5 or y=1, etc.\n\nBut y=5 has collision at T=15? Let's see.\n\nIn turn 15, if I am on y=7, I don't care about y=5.\n\nNow, in this sequence:\n\nTurn 12: at y=4, action U\n\nTurn 13: at y=5, action U\n\nTurn 14: at y=6, action U\n\nTurn 15: at y=7, action U\n\nTurn 16: at y=8, action U\n\nTurn 17: at y=9, done.\n\nH=6 turns? From turn 12 to turn 17, that's 6 steps? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at turn 12, position given.\n\nAfter first action at turn 12, at turn 13 position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nt1=12.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position for turn t+1? No.\n\nThe position: at turn t, y_t is given.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set accordingly.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nI start at turn 12, y=4.\n\nI perform actions for turns 12,13,14,... up to some turn when y=9.\n\nLet the turn when I first reach y=9 be T_end.\n\nThen H is the number of actions from turn 12 to turn T_end - 1? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn T.\n\nThat means at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThis is achieved by action at turn T-1, which set y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn 12 to turn T-1, for T-12 actions? Turn 12 to turn T-1 inclusive.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position.\n\nIn this case, t1=12, after H actions, at turn 12 + H, position y_{12+H}.\n\nWe want y_{12+H} =9.\n\nSo H is such that at turn 12+H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are a_{12} to a_{12+H-1}.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at turn 12, y=4, if I always S, y stays 4.\n\nBut I need to reach 9.\n\nIn the direct up path: at turn 12, action U: y_{13} =5\n\nTurn 13, action U: y_{14}=6\n\nTurn 14, action U: y_{15}=7\n\nTurn 15, action U: y_{16}=8\n\nTurn 16, action U: y_{17}=9\n\nSo at turn 17, y=9, so H=5 actions: turns 12,13,14,15,16.\n\nActions at turns 12 to 16, H=5, position at turn 17=9.\n\nNow, during this, I was on:\n\nTurn 12: y=4, freeway, no collision (as before)\n\nTurn 13: y=5, freeway, at T=13, no collision (span [37,48], [1,12], [-35,-24], no 0)\n\nTurn 14: y=6, freeway, at T=14, dt=2, span [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], no 0, so no collision\n\nTurn 15: y=7, freeway, but y=7 no collision ever\n\nTurn 16: y=8, freeway, no collision\n\nAnd at turn 17, y=9, not freeway.\n\nBut at turn 15, y=7, safe.\n\nIs there any issue at turn 15? y=7 is safe.\n\nBut y=5 has collision at T=15, but I am not on y=5 at T=15, I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 has collision at T=15, but not relevant.\n\nIn this path, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm y=5 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, if someone is on y=5, collision, but in this sequence, at T=15, I am on y=7, not y=5.\n\nAt T=15, y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, I am on y=8.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 has collision at later times, but not at T=14.\n\nSo with H=5, it seems possible: all U from turn 12 to 16.\n\nActions: turn 12: U, turn 13: U, turn 14: U, turn 15: U, turn 16: U, reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=4 to y=9, min 5 moves up, so H=5 is minimal, since each U increases y by 1, and S or D would take more turns or go away.\n\nSo H=5 should be achievable.\n\nBut in the car states, is there any constraint I missed?\n\nFor example, at turn 14, I am on y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision times.\n\nFor y=6, collision only at T=24,25,26,27, which are later than 17, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in y=4, at turn 14, if I were there, but I am not.\n\nIn this path, I leave y=4 at turn 12, to y=5 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 14, I am on y=6.\n\ny=4 has collision at T=14? For y=4, collisions at T=14,15,20,21.\n\nAt T=14, on y=4, would have collision.\n\nBut in this path, at T=14, I am on y=6, not y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15, y=4 would have collision, but I am on y=7.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nPerhaps I should list for each turn the occupied freeways.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nThe problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it faster? No, 5 steps min.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by going faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so min 5 actions.\n\nUnless I start from y=4, but at turn 12 I am at y=4, after first U at turn 13 y=5, etc., cannot reach before turn 17.\n\nTurn 12: y=4\n\nAfter action, turn 13: y=5 if U\n\nTurn 14: y=6 if U\n\n...\n\nTurn 17: y=9 if U at turn 16.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, but in the actions, I need to specify for each turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=5 at T=15.\n\ny=5 collision at T=15: from the third car, span at T=15, dt=3, [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so if on y=5 at T=15, collision.\n\nBut in my path, at T=15, I am on y=7, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, y=1 has collision, but I am on y=8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, but at T=14, no collision.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, but in this case, no problem.\n\nSo minimal H=5, sequence: U,U,U,U,U for turns 12 to 16.\n\nBut the actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is 12 to 16.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAnd at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut the player position at turn 17 is (0,9), reached.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to avoid something?\n\nPerhaps I should check if at some point I must wait.\n\nFor example, if I go up, at turn 14 I am on y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut suppose I stay at some point.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=4 at turn 12, but that would delay, not helpful.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo this seems optimal.\n\nBut let me see the freeway y=3 and y=4 have collisions at T=14,15, but I am not there.\n\ny=2 has collisions at T=15,16,17, but I am on y=7,8 at those times.\n\nAt T=15, y=7; T=16, y=8; T=17, y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, but collision late.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt1=12.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nNow, in the car state, for y=6, there is a car, but at T=14, it's at [-41,-30], not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nAt turn 12, y=4.\n\nAfter U, turn 13 y=5.\n\ny=5 at T=13: as above, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position and freeway at each turn.\n\nTurn T | y_T | freeway | collision?\n\nT=12: y=4, freeway 4, no collision (as computed)\n\nT=13: y=5, freeway 5, no collision\n\nT=14: y=6, freeway 6, no collision (span [-41,-30])\n\nT=15: y=7, freeway 7, no collision ever\n\nT=16: y=8, freeway 8, no collision ever\n\nT=17: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll clear.\n\nBut is there a car on y=7? y=7 has a car (24,1,right,24), but at any time, span [1+24dt,24+24dt], min [1,24] at dt=0, all >0, so never at 0.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5, with all U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less. Suppose I do something else, but from y=4 to y=9, min 5 steps, so no.\n\nIf I could move faster, but no, only +1 per turn.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is straightforward.\n\nBut in the car list, for y=5, there is a car with (0,-11,right,12) at T=12, but at T=12, I am not on y=5, and for T>12, it moves away.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and the span of any car on that freeway includes \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\nThe car positions and collision times for each freeway are computed based on the initial state at turn 12. For each freeway, the turns where \\(x = 0\\) is within a car's span (indicating a collision risk if the player is on that freeway) are:\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Collisions at turns 15, 16, 17.\n- **Freeway 2**: Collisions at turns 15, 16, 17.\n- **Freeway 3**: Collisions at turns 14, 15 (from first car) and 20, 21 (from second car).\n- **Freeway 4**: Collisions at turns 14, 15, 20, 21.\n- **Freeway 5**: Collision at turn 15 (from third car).\n- **Freeway 6**: Collisions at turns 24, 25, 26, 27.\n- **Freeway 7**: No collisions at any turn.\n- **Freeway 8**: No collisions at any turn.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9)\nThe player starts at (0, 4) at turn 12. To reach (0, 9), the player must increase \\(y\\) by 5, requiring at least 5 \"up\" (U) actions. The direct path with all U actions is feasible and collision-free, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 12**: Player at \\(y = 4\\).  \n  - Action: U → \\(y_{13} = 5\\).  \n  - Collision check: On freeway 4 at turn 12; no collision (spans: [-23, -12], [-59, -48], [19, 30]; 0 not in any span).\n\n- **Turn 13**: Player at \\(y = 5\\).  \n  - Action: U → \\(y_{14} = 6\\).  \n  - Collision check: On freeway 5 at turn 13; no collision (spans: [37, 48], [1, 12], [-35, -24]; 0 not in any span).\n\n- **Turn 14**: Player at \\(y = 6\\).  \n  - Action: U → \\(y_{15} = 7\\).  \n  - Collision check: On freeway 6 at turn 14; no collision (span: [-47 + 3 \\times 2, -36 + 3 \\times 2] = [-41, -30]; 0 not in span).\n\n- **Turn 15**: Player at \\(y = 7\\).  \n  - Action: U → \\(y_{16} = 8\\).  \n  - Collision check: On freeway 7 at turn 15; no collision ever (spans always positive, e.g., [1 + 24 \\times 3, 24 + 24 \\times 3] = [73, 96] at turn 15; 0 not in span).\n\n- **Turn 16**: Player at \\(y = 8\\).  \n  - Action: U → \\(y_{17} = 9\\).  \n  - Collision check: On freeway 8 at turn 16; no collision ever (similar to freeway 7).\n\nAt turn 17, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\)\nThe sequence of 5 U actions from turn 12 to turn 16 reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17. Since each U action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no shorter path exists (as \\(y\\) must increase by 5), \\(H = 5\\) is minimal.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1 = 12\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16\\):\n\n- Turn 12: U\n- Turn 13: U\n- Turn 14: U\n- Turn 15: U\n- Turn 16: U\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions and reaches (0, 9) in minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,5). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at the same turn, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and the cars move horizontally (left or right) at constant speeds.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 13) for H turns until we reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T0 = 13.\n\nWe have to avoid freeways 1 to 8 at the turn when we are on them. We can pass through a freeway only when there is no car on that freeway at the same turn that covers x=0.\n\nWe start at y=5. We need to get to y=9. So we must go up. But we can also go down to avoid cars? However, going down would take us away from the goal. So we must plan the path to avoid the cars.\n\nNote: We are at x=0 at every turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=13. For any future turn T (>=13), we can compute the position of each car.\n\nFor a car on a freeway k at turn t1 with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, t, d, s):\n\nIf the car is right-moving (d='right'), then at turn T:\n  head(T) = h + s*(T - t1)\n  tail(T) = t + s*(T - t1)\n\nBut note: in the table, for right-moving cars, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the representation in the table is given as (head, tail) and for right-moving, the car moves to the right. However, note the update rule:\n\nRight-moving: [τ, h] at t1 becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\nBut in the table, the representation is (head, tail). So for a right-moving car, the head is the right end and the tail is the left end? Actually, in the update rule for right-moving, they write: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So in the table, the first number is the tail and the second is the head? But that doesn't match the table representation.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nIf we interpret the first number as the head and the second as the tail, then for a right-moving car, at t1=13, the head is at -8 and the tail at -19? But that would mean the car is from -19 to -8? Then as it moves right, at time T, the head becomes -8 + 4*(T-13) and the tail becomes -19 + 4*(T-13). But the update rule says for right-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h + s*(T-t1), τ + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nRight-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo in the table, the first number is τ (the left end) and the second is h (the right end) for a right-moving car? But the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". This is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read: \n\nThe table says: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBut in the update rule for left-moving: they use [h, τ] and for right-moving: [τ, h]. \n\nThis inconsistency in notation? Actually, the update rule for left-moving says: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\". So for left-moving, h is the head (leftmost?) and τ is the tail (rightmost?).\n\nBut for right-moving, they write: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So for right-moving, τ is the head (rightmost?) and h is the tail (leftmost?).\n\nThis is messy. I think we should interpret the table as:\n\nFor any car, the first number is the position of the front of the car in the direction of motion, and the second is the back.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost point (smallest x) and the tail is the rightmost (largest x). Then the car moves left, so the head moves left and the tail moves left.\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point (largest x) and the tail is the leftmost (smallest x). Then the car moves right, so the head moves right and the tail moves right.\n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving, they wrote: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning [tail, head]? That would be [leftmost, rightmost] for a right-moving car? Then that matches: the tail is the left end and the head is the right end.\n\nSo for a car in the table: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\n- For right-moving: head is the right end, tail is the left end. The span at t1 is [tail, head] (i.e., [left, right]).\n- For left-moving: head is the left end, tail is the right end. The span at t1 is [head, tail] (i.e., [left, right]).\n\nBut note: in the problem, there are no left-moving cars in this instance? All cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for every car, we have:\n\n  At turn t1=13: the car's span is [tail, head] (for right-moving) meaning from tail (left) to head (right).\n\nThen at turn T, the car's position is:\n\n  left(T) = tail + s*(T - 13)\n  right(T) = head + s*(T - 13)\n\nWe must avoid being on the freeway k at turn T if the car is present and 0 is in [left(T), right(T)].\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and compute when they are covering x=0 at their respective freeways.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8, and we are going from y=5 to y=9. So we might need to pass through freeways 6,7,8 (if we go straight up) or maybe take a detour? But note: we start at 5 and want to go to 9, so we must go through 6,7,8. We can also go down to 4,3, etc., but that would increase the number of steps. We want minimal H.\n\nSo the minimal H without any cars would be 4: U, U, U, U -> from 5 to 9 in 4 steps.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on freeways 6,7,8 at the turns when we are on them.\n\nWe will be on freeway 6 at some turn, then 7, then 8, and then 9.\n\nBut note: we start at 5 at turn 13. Then:\n\nTurn 13: y=5 -> no car to avoid? We are at 5, and freeway 5 has cars? But we are at (0,5) at turn 13. So we must check freeway 5 at turn 13: are there cars that cover x=0?\n\nSimilarly, we must check every freeway we step on at the exact turn we are on it.\n\nSo let's compute the car positions at turn 13 for the freeways we will step on.\n\nBut we are going to move. We are at turn 13 at y=5. Then at turn 14, we move to y=6? or stay? etc.\n\nWe need to plan the actions for turns 13,14,15,... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn 13 onwards.\n\nFirst, we must avoid the cars on the freeways we step on at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at any turn T (>=13) for the freeways that are in our path (freeways 5,6,7,8) because we start at 5 and go to 9.\n\nBut note: we might not go straight? We might stay or go down to avoid a car at a future turn? However, going down would require more steps to come back, so we want to avoid that if possible.\n\nWe'll try to go straight up if we can.\n\nOur path: we start at y=5 at T=13.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the last turn.\n\nWe will be at y=5 at T=13, then at T=14 we can be at y=4,5,6; then T=15: 3,4,5,6,7; etc.\n\nBut we want the minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nFirst, let's check the starting position: at T=13, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor each car, we compute the span at T=13:\n\nCar1: tail=37, head=48, speed=12 -> left=37, right=48 -> at T=13, the car is at [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48] -> safe.\n\nCar2: tail=1, head=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nCar3: tail=-35, head=-24 -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nSo at T=13, we are safe at y=5.\n\nNow, we can choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go to y=9, so U is the natural choice.\n\nBut let's see if we can go to y=6 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, we would be at y=6. So we must check freeway 6 at T=14.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-33,-44,right,3) -> so tail=-44, head=-33.\n\nAt T=14: left = -44 + 3*(14-13) = -44+3 = -41\n        right = -33 + 3 = -30\n        So the car is at [-41, -30] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nSo we can go U at T=13 to get to y=6 at T=14.\n\nThen at T=14, we are at y=6. Now we want to go to y=7? Then at T=15 we would be at y=7.\n\nCheck freeway 7 at T=15.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,25,right,24) -> tail=25, head=48.\n\nAt T=15: left = 25 + 24*(15-13) = 25 + 24*2 = 25+48=73\n        right = 48 + 24*2 = 48+48=96\n        So the car is at [73,96] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nThen we can go U again at T=14 to get to y=7 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, we are at y=7. Then we go U at T=15 to get to y=8 at T=16.\n\nNow, check freeway 8 at T=16.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,25,right,24) -> same as freeway 7? \n\nAt T=16: left = 25 + 24*(16-13) = 25 + 24*3 = 25+72=97\n        right = 48 + 24*3 = 48+72=120\n        So [97,120] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nThen we go U at T=16 to get to y=9 at T=17.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 13: U -> y=6 at T=14\nTurn 14: U -> y=7 at T=15\nTurn 15: U -> y=8 at T=16\nTurn 16: U -> y=9 at T=17 -> done.\n\nH = 4? But wait, we started at T=13 at y=5, and after 4 actions we are at T=17 at y=9. That seems minimal.\n\nBut we must check every step:\n\nAt T=13: y=5 -> safe (as above)\nAt T=14: y=6 -> safe (car at [-41,-30] -> safe)\nAt T=15: y=7 -> safe (car at [73,96] -> safe)\nAt T=16: y=8 -> safe (car at [97,120] -> safe)\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 4 steps.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway 5 at T=13? We did that. And freeway 6 at T=14, 7 at T=15, 8 at T=16.\n\nBut are there any other cars on other freeways that we are stepping on? We are only stepping on freeway 5 at T=13, 6 at T=14, 7 at T=15, 8 at T=16, and then 9 at T=17 (which has no cars).\n\nBut the problem says: cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So y=9 is safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway 5 at T=13: we did. Freeway 6 at T=14: car at [-41,-30] -> 0 not in there. Freeway 7 at T=15: [73,96] -> safe. Freeway 8 at T=16: [97,120] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway 6 has only one car? And we are safe. However, let me check if there are any other cars on freeway 6? The table says only one car. Similarly for 7 and 8.\n\nBut wait, freeway 5 has three cars, but we are safe at T=13.\n\nIs there any car that might appear at x=0 at a later time on a freeway we are going to be? We are only on freeway 5 at T=13, 6 at T=14, 7 at T=15, 8 at T=16. We don't step on any other freeway.\n\nBut what about freeway 5: the cars are moving. At T=14, we are not on freeway 5, so we don't care. Similarly for others.\n\nBut wait, what if we stay at a freeway for multiple turns? But in this plan, we are at each freeway for only one turn.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 6? The car at T=14 is at [-41,-30]. Then at T=15, the same car would be at [-41+3, -30+3] = [-38,-27] -> still not covering 0. But we are not on freeway 6 at T=15, we are on 7.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7: at T=15 we are on it, and the car is at [73,96]. At T=16, it would be at [73+24, 96+24] = [97,120] -> which is the same as freeway 8 at T=16? But we are not on freeway 7 at T=16.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So when we move:\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose an action. Then at the next turn (T+1), we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. And we only check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nTurn 13: we are at y=5 -> check freeway 5 at T=13 -> safe.\nTurn 14: we are at y=6 -> check freeway 6 at T=14 -> safe.\nTurn 15: we are at y=7 -> check freeway 7 at T=15 -> safe.\nTurn 16: we are at y=8 -> check freeway 8 at T=16 -> safe.\n\nAnd then at turn 17, we are at y=9 -> no car check.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut why do we have multiple cars on freeways 1 to 4? We don't step on them, so we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We are at y=5 at T=13. We need to get to y=9. The minimal steps is 4 (each step up). So 4 is the minimum.\n\nBut what if there was a car at freeway 6 at T=14? Then we might have to wait or detour. But in this case, there isn't.\n\nBut wait, let me reexamine freeway 6 at T=14: the car is at [-41, -30]. Is that correct?\n\nThe car on freeway 6: (-33, -44, right, 3) -> so head = -33, tail = -44? \n\nFor right-moving: head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nAt T=13: left = tail = -44, right = head = -33 -> so the car is at [-44, -33] at T=13.\n\nAt T=14: since speed=3, it moves right by 3: so left = -44+3 = -41, right = -33+3 = -30 -> [-41,-30]. So 0 is not in that interval.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7: car (48,25,right,24) -> at T=13: left=25, right=48 -> [25,48] at T=13.\n\nAt T=15: 2 turns later, so moves by 24*2=48: left=25+48=73, right=48+48=96 -> [73,96] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same car? The table has the same for freeway 8: (48,25,right,24). So at T=16: 3 turns later, moves by 24*3=72: left=25+72=97, right=48+72=120 -> [97,120] -> safe.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway 5 has three cars. At T=13, we are safe. But what if we stayed at freeway 5 at T=14? We don't, but let's see if any car on freeway 5 would cover 0 at T=14? We don't need to because we are leaving at T=13. But for curiosity:\n\nCar1: [37,48] at T=13 -> at T=14: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\nCar2: [1,12] -> [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe.\nCar3: [-35,-24] -> [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nSo even if we stayed, we would be safe? But we don't.\n\nBut we are going to move.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut the answer format: we start at turn t1=13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn 17? But the last action is at turn 16, and then at turn 17 we are at 9. So H=4.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1, so we have H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H - 1? Let me see: \n\nAt turn t1 (13), we take the first action (t=0). Then at turn 14 (t1+1), we take the second (t=1), ... until t=H-1 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen at the next turn (t1+H), we are at the new state. We want at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the player position after H actions would be at turn t1 + H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThat is confusing.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo the position at turn t+1 is determined by a_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (13) at (0,5). Then we take action a_{t1} (at turn 13) and then at turn 14 we are at y_{14} = y_{13} + Delta(a_{13}).\n\nThen at turn 15: y_{15} = y_{14} + Delta(a_{14}), etc.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn t1 + H - 1? \n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t1 + t} for t=0,1,...,H-1.\n\nSo the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H}? \n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat means we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, which is before taking the last action? \n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo we start at turn t1: we are at y_{t1} = 5.\n\nWe take action a_{t1} at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut according to the update, if we take H actions, then the last state we are in is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat means we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take the last action at turn t1+H-1? But then that action would move us away? \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me check the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo it says: we want the player to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: at turn t1+H-1, we are about to take the (H-1)-th action? \n\nBut the actions are taken at each turn. At turn t, we take action a_t, and then we move to the next state at turn t+1.\n\nSo if we are at y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at turn t1+H-1, that means we have already taken H-1 actions? \n\nLet me index:\n\nTurn: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1\n\nAt turn t1: we start at y_{t1}=5. Then we take a_{t1} (which is the first action) -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t1+k? \n\nAfter 0 actions: at turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=5.\n\nAfter 1 action: at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions: at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat means at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. But that is after (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1 actions.\n\nSo we take H-1 actions to get to turn t1+H-1 at state y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut then why is the sequence defined for t=0 to H-1? That would be H actions.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps the problem considers that we take the actions at the beginning of the turn, and then the state at the same turn is the result? But the update rule says y_{t+1} = y_t + ... so the state changes at the next turn.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we are specifying actions for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position at turn t1+H is the result after the last action.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read the goal: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut in the update rule: after taking action a_t at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then we go to y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nWe never set y_t directly by an action at the same turn.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have arrived there by the action taken at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (total H-1 actions) to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, which would be H actions.\n\nThe problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H actions, and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut with H actions, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must be at 9 at the turn before the last action? \n\nBut then the last action (the H-th action, at turn t1+H-1) would move us from 9 to somewhere else.\n\nThat doesn't make sense for the goal.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem: it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of H actions.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end.\n\nThe update rule: after taking an action at turn t, we are at the next state at turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to y_T=9.\n\nTherefore, if we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we must have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the last action in the sequence is at turn t1+H-1, which would then move us to y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nSo if we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence requires H actions up to turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we take actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the final turn (after the last action) we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly states: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnother possibility: the turn index includes the starting turn. But the player starts at turn t1 at position (0,5). Then we take an action at turn t1, and then we are at turn t1+1 at a new position.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn. The problem specifies that turn as t1+H-1.\n\nSo if H is the number of turns we simulate? But the minimal number of turns from the start to the goal.\n\nIn our case, we start at turn 13 at y=5. We want to be at y=9 at turn T. The minimal T is 17 (if we go up each step: 13->5, 14->6, 15->7, 16->8, 17->9). So T=17.\n\nThen H should be the number of actions? Or the number of turns from t1 to T?\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And then the sequence has H actions? But H actions cover H turns? Or H+1 turns?\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so H turns of actions? Then the state is updated from t1 to t1+H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be the state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut in our case, if we want to be at 9 at turn 17, which is t1+4 (since 13+4=17), then we want y_{17}=9.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo 13+H-1=17 -> H-1=4 -> H=5.\n\nThen the sequence would be for turns 13 to 13+5-1=17? But turn 17 would be the last action, and then we move to turn 18.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn 17, so we must arrive at turn 17 by the action at turn 16.\n\nSo with H=5, we would have actions at turns 13,14,15,16,17.\n\nBut the action at turn 17 would then move us to y_{18} at turn 18.\n\nThat is not what we want.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that H is the number of actions taken, and after H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me look at the answer format: they show \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\", then \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\", etc.\n\nAnd they stop when we reach 9.\n\nIn the condition, it says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo for example, if we reach at turn t1, then H-1=0? So H=1, and we are at turn t1 at y=9. But we start at y=5, so not possible.\n\nIf we reach at turn t1+1, then y_{t1+1}=9, and we would have H-1 = 1? So H=2, and we have one action at turn t1 that gets us to y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nIn our case, to get from 5 to 9, we need 4 steps up, so we would reach at turn t1+4 = 17, so we want y_{17}=9.\n\nThen t1+H-1 = 13+H-1 = 17 -> so H-1=4 -> H=5.\n\nBut then the sequence has H=5 actions: for turns 13,14,15,16,17.\n\nBut after the action at turn 17, we move to turn 18. But we want to be at 9 at turn 17, which is before the action at turn 17.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at turn 17 without taking an action at turn 17.\n\nTherefore, the last action should be at turn 16, which moves us to 9 at turn 17.\n\nSo the sequence should be for turns 13 to 16, which is 4 actions, and then at turn 17 we are at 9.\n\nBut then H-1 = 17 - 13 = 4, so H=5? That doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the problem considers the turns as including the starting turn without action.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nLet me assume that the sequence has H actions, and after the last action, we are at turn t1+H, and we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nIn many such problems, H is the number of actions, and we want the state after H actions.\n\nAnd the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but then the sequence has H actions, so H turns in which we act.\n\nBut the starting turn is turn t1, and we take an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1, etc.\n\nSo the turns we act are t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H, we are at the new state.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, and it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBecause otherwise, it doesn't make sense.\n\nIn our earlier plan, we reach y=9 at turn 17 = t1+4.\n\nSo we want y_{13+4}=y_17=9.\n\nSo if H is the number of actions, then after 4 actions (at turns 13,14,15,16), we are at turn 17 at y=9.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H}=y_{13+4}=17=9.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=y_{13+4-1}=y_16=9? That would be if we reached at turn 16.\n\nBut in our plan, at turn 16 we are at y=8.\n\nSo to have y_16=9, we would have to reach earlier.\n\nBut that is not possible with 4 up moves.\n\nSo I think the problem has a typo. It should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBecause the player update is for the next turn.\n\nI will assume that the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H, after H actions.\n\nTherefore, in our case, H=4, and the sequence is:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nAnd then at turn 17, we are at y=9.\n\nAnd the problem should have said: \"such that y_{t1 + H} = 9\", but it said \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nGiven the confusion, and that our plan is valid and minimal, and matches the natural interpretation, I will output that.\n\nBut to be safe, let's see if there is any car that we missed.\n\nAnother thing: the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". In our plan, we are moving every turn, so at each turn T, we are only on one freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, we are at y=6, and we were at y=5 at turn 13, so we moved. So at turn 14, we are on freeway 6, and we check cars on freeway 6 at turn 14.\n\nWe are not considered on freeway 6 at turn 13, so even if there was a car at freeway 6 at turn 13 covering 0, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn our case, at turn 13, freeway 6 car is at [-44,-33], which does not cover 0, so safe anyway.\n\nSo I think the plan is valid.\n\nPerhaps the problem intended to have a car blocking at freeway 6 at turn 14, but as computed, the car is at [-41,-30], which is far left.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo I'll go with the 4-step plan.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn 16: car at [97,120] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway 5 at turn 13: safe.\n\n freeway 6 at turn 14: safe.\n\n freeway 7 at turn 15: safe.\n\n freeway 8 at turn 16: safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=4.\n\nAnd the sequence is for t=0 to 3 (H-1=3), but in the answer format, we list each turn.\n\nSo we list from turn 13 to turn 16.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is 4 actions: t=0,1,2,3 -> turns 13,14,15,16.\n\nAnd then at turn 17, we are at 9.\n\nAnd the problem wants y_{t1+H-1}=y_{16}=? But in our case, at turn 16 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nUnless we consider that we reach at the same turn? But we can't.\n\nPerhaps the last action at turn 16 is not needed if we are already at 9, but we are at 8 at turn 16, so we need to go up.\n\nBut then at turn 17, we are at 9.\n\nSo to have y_{16}=9, we would have to be there at turn 16, which would require only 3 up moves? But we start at 5, so 5+3=8, not 9.\n\nTo get to 9 from 5, we need 4 up moves.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at 9 is turn 17.\n\nTherefore, the condition must be that we are at 9 at turn t1+H, after H actions.\n\nI think the problem has a typo and it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" means the number of turns including the starting turn. But then we start at turn 13 at y=5, and we want to be at y=9 at turn T. The number of turns from 13 to T is T-12? Or the number of turns we wait.\n\nI think it's safer to output the sequence that gets us to y=9 at turn 17, with actions at turns 13,14,15,16.\n\nAnd since the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we use 4 actions (which take 4 turns: 13,14,15,16), and then we arrive at turn 17, but the actions are taken in 4 turns.\n\nBut the problem might count H as the number of turns from start to finish, which would be 5 turns (13 to 17), but then the sequence would have 4 actions.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps in the context, \"turns H\" means the number of actions.\n\nI recall that in the task: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\nAnd the goal is to be at (0,9) after the actions, which is at turn t1+H.\n\nSo I'll assume that.\n\nTherefore, H=4.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 4. The sequence of actions starts at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) and is as follows:\n\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 13 (y=5)**: Cars on freeway 5 are at spans \\([37, 48]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), and \\([-35, -24]\\). None cover x=0. Safe.\n- **Turn 14 (y=6)**: The car on freeway 6 is at span \\([-41, -30]\\) (computed as \\(-44 + 3 \\times (14-13) = -41\\) for tail and \\(-33 + 3 = -30\\) for head). Does not cover x=0. Safe.\n- **Turn 15 (y=7)**: The car on freeway 7 is at span \\([73, 96]\\) (computed as \\(25 + 24 \\times (15-13) = 73\\) for tail and \\(48 + 48 = 96\\) for head). Does not cover x=0. Safe.\n- **Turn 16 (y=8)**: The car on freeway 8 is at span \\([97, 120]\\) (computed as \\(25 + 24 \\times (16-13) = 97\\) for tail and \\(48 + 72 = 120\\) for head). Does not cover x=0. Safe.\n\nThe goal \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 17 after 4 actions, with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U\n}",

Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to turn t_1=14. The car positions are given at turn 14, and they move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity, since t_1 is given as 14, but I'll work relative to t_1. So at turn τ = 0 (which is t_1), player is at y=6.\n\nI need to find actions for turns τ=0 to τ=H-1 such that at turn τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so the actions start at turn t_1 and go to turn t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, at time t_1 + H, we should be at y=9? Let's see.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we apply action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} = 6.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), which I assume is at some turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nNow, the actions are from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nAt time t_1, we are at y_{t_1} = 6.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we move to y_{t_1 + 1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}.\n\nThen after a_{t_1 + 1}, y_{t_1 + 2} = y_{t_1 + 1} + Δy_{t_1 + 1}, and so on, up to after action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H - 1} + Δy_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, which is before the last action? That doesn't make sense.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means that at the beginning of turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9, but we haven't applied the action for that turn yet.\n\nPerhaps I need to clarify the timing.\n\nLet me define the state at the start of each turn.\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the start of turn t+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T: if at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you avoid collision if on y_{T+1} if 0 is in span at T but not at T+1, but since you are not on it at T, it's fine.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T, the freeway you are on at that turn.\n\nNow, for reaching (0,9): we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nBut at that point, we are at y=9, which is the goal, so we don't need to do anything else, but the action for turn t_1 + H - 1 might be applied, but if we are already at y=9, and we apply an action, we might move away, but we want to be at y=9 at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1, so for that turn, we don't care about the action, as long as we are there at the start.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, which affect the position from t_1+1 to t_1 + H.\n\nAt start of turn t_1, position y=6.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at start of turn t_1+1 is y=6 + Δy.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1+1}, position at start of turn t_1+2 is y_{t_1+1} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, position at start of turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H - 1} + Δy_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nWe want at start of turn t_1 + H - 1, position y=9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9, and we may or may not apply an action, but since we are already at the goal, the action for that turn could be S, or whatever, but we need to specify it.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to provide actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H - 1, since we are at y=9 at the start of that turn, we should choose action S to stay, or U or D, but if we go U, we go to y=10, which is invalid since y=0 to9, so y+1 must be in 0 to9, so at y=9, we can only go down or stay, but we want to be at y=9, so at the turn when we are at y=9, we should choose S or D, but D would take us to y=8, which is not 9.\n\nLet's think.\n\nAt the start of turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nWe choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor us to be at y=9 at the start of turn t, it means that for some turn t, y_t =9.\n\nThen, for that turn, we are at the goal.\n\nThe actions before that turn get us to y_t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, we choose a_t, which affects the next position.\n\nBut when we reach y_t=9 at some turn t, we have succeeded, and we need to include the actions up to the turn before, I think, but the problem says the sequence includes actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9 at the start.\n\nThen for that turn, we choose an action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which will determine y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that, as long as at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at 9.\n\nFor the action at turn t_1 + H - 1, since we are at y=9, we can choose S to stay at 9 for the next turn, or D to go to 8, but that doesn't matter for reaching (0,9) at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1, so the action at that turn doesn't affect the position at that turn; it affects the next position.\n\nSo for the action at turn t_1 + H - 1, we can choose anything, but to avoid moving away, we might choose S, but it's not necessary.\n\nBut in terms of collision, at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are on y=9, so we need to check if there is a collision on freeway 9 at that turn.\n\nFreeways are from y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1, ..., 8\"\n\nAnd \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\ny_T is the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nIf we are on y=0 or y=9, there are no freeways, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nSo when we are at y=9, it's safe, and we have reached the goal.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nIn this case, we start at y=6, which is a freeway, so we need to be careful.\n\nBack to the task.\n\nWe need to go from y=6 to y=9 in H turns, meaning that after some actions, at the start of turn t_1 + k, we are at y=9 for some k.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions we take.\n\nFrom turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, we take H actions.\n\nAt start of turn t_1, position y=6.\n\nAfter H actions, at start of turn t_1 + H, position is y after H steps.\n\nBut we want at start of turn t_1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then we have one action at turn t_1, and we want y_{t_1} =9 at start of turn t_1, but we are at y=6, so not 9, so impossible for H=1.\n\ny_{t_1} is given as 6.\n\nWith H actions, positions from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H} are determined.\n\ny_{t_1} is initial, then after a_{t_1}, y_{t_1+1}, after a_{t_1+1}, y_{t_1+2}, ..., after a_{t_1+H-1}, y_{t_1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9 for some H.\n\nSo at start of turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at 9.\n\nThen for that turn, we apply action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which takes us to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we don't care about y_{t_1 + H}, as long as we are at 9 at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, the turns are t_1, t_1+1, etc.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn t_1 + 3, because from y=6, to go to y=9, we need to increase y by 3, so at least 3 up actions, but we can also move down or stay, so it might take more turns if we need to avoid cars.\n\nBut with only up actions, we can go from 6 to 7,7 to 8,8 to 9 in three actions, so at turn t_1 + 3, we could be at y=9.\n\ny at start of turn t_1: 6\n\nApply a_{t_1} = U, then y at start of turn t_1+1: 7\n\nApply a_{t_1+1} = U, y at t_1+2: 8\n\nApply a_{t_1+2} = U, y at t_1+3: 9\n\nSo at start of turn t_1+3, y=9.\n\nThen for H, we have actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, to be at y=9 at turn t_1+3, which is t_1 + H -1, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +3, thus H-1=3, H=4.\n\nActions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nSequence for t from 0 to H-1=3, so t=0,1,2: actions at t_1+0, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nAnd y at turn t_1 + (H-1) = t_1 +3 is 9.\n\nIf we can reach in fewer actions, but from 6 to 9, minimum 3 up actions, so minimum 3 actions, H=4 turns? H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nH is defined as the minimal number of turns, and the sequence has H actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it's Turn t_1: a, Turn t_1+1: a, etc, up to Turn t_1 + H -1: a.\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the example above, with 3 actions, we reach at turn t_1+3.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1+3, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nBut the actions are at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, which is three actions for H=4? No.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the length of the action sequence.\n\nFor H actions, we cover from turn t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nWith 3 actions, we can go from y_t1=6 to y_{t1+3}=9.\n\nAt turn t1+3, y=9, so for H, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1+3} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1+3, thus H-1=3, H=4.\n\nBut with 3 actions, H should be 3, but here we need H=4 to have y at turn t1+3.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nSuppose we take K actions, from turn t1 to t1+K-1.\n\nThen after K actions, we are at position at start of turn t1+K.\n\nBut we want to be at position 9 at some turn M, with M >= t1.\n\nThe turn when we are at 9 is M.\n\nThen the number of actions taken to reach there is M - t1, because from turn t1 to turn M, we have M - t1 actions: at turn t1, t1+1, ..., M-1.\n\nThen at start of turn M, we are at y=9.\n\nIn terms of H, we have actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions, for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen y at turn t1 + H is after H actions.\n\nBut we want y at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nSo the position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn t1, but y_t1=6≠9, impossible.\n\nIf we reach at turn t1+1, then y_{t1+1} =9, which means after one action at t1, we go to 9, but from 6, we can only go to 5,6,7, not to 9 directly, so impossible.\n\nEarliest at turn t1+3 with three up actions.\n\ny at turn t1+3 =9.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 = t1+3, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nWith H=4 actions: at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3? No.\n\nActions at t1, t1+1, t1+2 for three actions, to reach at turn t1+3.\n\nFor H, if H=4, actions at t1 to t1+3, but we want y at turn t1+ H-1 = t1+3 to be 9, so for H=4, y at turn t1+3=9, and actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3.\n\nAt turn t1+3, we are at y=9, and we apply action a_{t1+3}, which could be S, U, or D, but since we are at 9, U is invalid, so S or D.\n\nBut the position at turn t1+3 is 9 before the action.\n\nFor the action at t1+3, it doesn't affect the position at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for H=4, we have actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, and y at turn t1+3 is 9.\n\nBut with only three actions, we can have y at turn t1+3=9, and we don't need an action at t1+3 for reaching, but the sequence includes it for H=4.\n\nTo minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=3, y at turn t1+2 should be 9.\n\ny at turn t1+2: from y_t1=6, after two actions, we can be at y=6,7,8, or 5, etc, but not 9, since each action changes y by at most 1, so after two actions, y <= 8, so cannot be 9 at turn t1+2.\n\nSimilarly, for H=2, y at turn t1+1 <=7.\n\nH=1, y at turn t1=6.\n\nSo minimum H=4, with y at turn t1+3=9.\n\nWith H=4, we have four actions, but we reach at turn t1+3 with three actions, but for H=4, we have an extra action at turn t1+3.\n\nBut since we are at 9 at turn t1+3, we can choose S for a_{t1+3}, so it's fine.\n\nBut it's inefficient, but we have to include it because H=4 requires four actions.\n\nFor H=3, it's impossible to reach y=9 at turn t1+2.\n\nSo minimal H is 4, with y at turn t1+3=9.\n\nNow, we need to check if we can do it in 3 actions, but we can't, so H=4 is minimum possible without cars.\n\nWith cars, it might take more turns if we need to wait or go down.\n\nBut first, let's list the car positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 =14.\n\nPlayer at y=6.\n\nCars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nEach freeway has cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left, but in the car update, it says left-moving and right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: cars: (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4), (-44,-55,right,4)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update.\n\nCar update rules:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nAt turn T > t1, span:\n\nIf left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]  (since head and tail decrease)\n\nIn the text: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSpan(t1) = [h, τ], so if left-moving, h and τ decrease with time.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the text: \"right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], with τ < h, I assume, since it's tail to head.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1, first car: (-4,-15,right,4)\n\nAt t1, span is [τ, h] = [-15, -4]? But it says (head, tail), so head is -4, tail is -15, so for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [-15, -4], and since direction right, at T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-15 + 4(T-t1), -4 + 4(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (32,21,right,4), head=32, tail=21, so span at t1: [21,32], at T: [21 + 4(T-t1), 32 + 4(T-t1)]\n\nThird car: (-44,-55,right,4), span at t1: [-55,-44], at T: [-55 + 4(T-t1), -44 + 4(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if we are on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn τ=0 (t1=14), y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, with actions U,D,S.\n\nSince we want to go up, and minimize turns, we should try to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at each turn, whether position 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince we care about when we are on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so when on them, no collision.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, if we are on y_T between 1 and 8, we need that for that freeway, at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nOtherwise, collision.\n\nThe note: if we move to a different y at turn T, we are not on the new y at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, we are on y_T, and we move to y_{T+1} = y_T +1 or -1, then at turn T, we are on y_T, so we check collision for y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, so we check for y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIf we stay, we are on the same freeway.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway, for turns around t1, when 0 is occupied.\n\nSet t1 = 14 as time 0 for simplicity, so let t = T - t1, so at t=0, current time.\n\nThen for turn t (relative), the span for each car can be computed.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time t if 0 is in any car's span on freeway k at time t.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1:\n\nCars: \n1. (h=-4, τ=-15, d=right, s=4) → span at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-15 + 4t, -4 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -15 + 4t <= 0 <= -4 + 4t\n\nSo -15 + 4t <= 0 and 0 <= -4 + 4t\n\nFirst inequality: -15 + 4t <= 0 => 4t <= 15 => t <= 15/4 = 3.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -4 + 4t => 4 <= 4t => t >= 1\n\nSo for t from 1 to 3, since t integer, t=1,2,3.\n\nt=1: -15+4= -11, -4+4=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included? 0 <= 0, yes.\n\nt=2: -15+8= -7, -4+8=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=3: -15+12= -3, -4+12=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=4: -15+16=1, -4+16=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, car 2: (h=32, τ=21, d=right, s=4) span at t: [21 + 4t, 32 + 4t]\n\n0 in? 21+4t <= 0 <= 32+4t?

Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt start of turn t (relative time), position y_t.\n\nApply action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe want y_M =9 for some M.\n\nEarliest M=3.\n\nSo let's check if we can go directly up: actions U,U,U at t=0,1,2.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0: start y=6, apply U, go to y=7 at t=1\n\nt=1: start y=7, apply U, go to y=8 at t=2\n\nt=2: start y=8, apply U, go to y=9 at t=3\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at turn t=3 for H, but let's first check collisions during the path.\n\nAt each turn, we are on a freeway and need to avoid collision.\n\nAt turn t=0: we are on y=6 (freeway 6). Is it occupied at t=0? Freeway 6 occupied at t=10,11,12,13, not at t=0, so safe.\n\nAt turn t=1: we are on y=7 (freeway 7). Freeway 7 never occupied, so safe.\n\nAt turn t=2: we are on y=8 (freeway 8). Freeway 8 never occupied, so safe.\n\nThen at t=3, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nSo with actions U at t=0, U at t=1, U at t=2, we reach y=9 at t=3.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere, we reach at t=3, which is relative turn 3, absolute turn t1 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere at turn t1+3, y=9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 +3, thus H-1=3, H=4.\n\nActions at t=0,1,2,3 relative.\n\nAt t=0,1,2: we applied U,U,U to go to y=7,8,9 at t=1,2,3.\n\nAt turn t=3 (relative), we are at y=9, and we need to apply action a_{t=3}, which can be S, for example.\n\nSo actions: at t=0: U, t=1: U, t=2: U, t=3: S\n\nThen at turn t1+3, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for H=4, actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3.\n\nAnd y at turn t1+3 is 9.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t=3, we are on y=9, no freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nIn this path, we didn't have any collision, and we reached in minimal time.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway at each turn.\n\nTurn t=0 (abs 14): y=6, freeway 6, not occupied, safe.\n\nAfter action U, at turn t=1 (abs 15): y=7, freeway 7, never occupied, safe.\n\nAfter action U, at turn t=2 (abs 16): y=8, freeway 8, never occupied, safe.\n\nAfter action U, at turn t=3 (abs 17): y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nThen at turn t=3, we apply action S, so at turn t=4 (abs 18), y=9, but we don't care.\n\nNow, but we need to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=4, so turns: turn 14, 15, 16, 17.\n\nActions: at turn 14: U, turn 15: U, turn 16: U, turn 17: S\n\nAnd at turn 17 (t1+3), y=9.\n\nBut is turn 17 t1 + H -1? t1=14, H=4, t1 + H -1 = 14+4-1=17, yes.\n\nIn the sequence, we have four actions.\n\nBut earlier I thought with three actions we can reach, but for H=4, we have an extra action at the end.\n\nBut since we must have y at turn t1+H-1=9, and for H=3, we cannot reach y=9 at turn t1+2, so H=4 is minimal.\n\nIn this case, with cars, it worked directly.\n\nBut let me check if freeway 7 and 8 are indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 7: car (72,49,right,24), at any t, span [49+24t, 72+24t], min at t=0 is 49>0, so 0 never in, yes.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=0: not occupied.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if we need to worry about other times.\n\nFor example, if we go slower, but here we go fast, no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can go in fewer turns, but impossible.\n\nOr if we go down first, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H should be 4.\n\nBut in the action sequence, at turn 17, we put S, but it could be anything, but S is fine.\n\nNow, the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nFirst, H=4.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nBut at turn 17, we are at y=9, and we apply S to stay, but the position at turn 17 is already 9, and we are specifying action for that turn.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=3 with y at turn t1+2=9, but impossible since from y=6, after two actions, at most y=8.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, at t=0, they are occupied.\n\nBut we are not on them at t=0, we are on y=6.\n\nIn our path, we go to y=7 at t=1, which is freeway 7, safe.\n\nAt t=1, freeway 3 and 4 are occupied, but we are not on them.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps if we tried to go to y=5 or something, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we are at (0,9) at turn 17.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 14: U Turn 15: U Turn 16: U Turn 17: S }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo for t_1=14,\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 17, action S, but since we are at y=9, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence without the last action, but H must include it.\n\nAnother thing: in the collision note, it says that if we move to a different y at turn T, we are not on the new y at turn T.\n\nBut in our case, when we move from y=6 to y=7 at turn T=14 (t=0), at turn T=14, we are on y=6, so we check freeway 6 at t=0, safe.\n\nThen at turn T=15 (t=1), we are on y=7, check freeway 7, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, it is occupied at t=1, but we are not on it.\n\nIn our path, we never go to freeway 5.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4 with this sequence.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to take a different path.\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately, but freeway 6 might be occupied at some point, but in this case, at t=0, it is safe, and we leave immediately.\n\nIf we stayed at y=6, at t=1, freeway 6 is not occupied yet, only from t=10, so safe for now.\n\nBut we don't need to stay.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) is 4. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 14, apply action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y=6\\) to \\(y=7\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, apply action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y=7\\) to \\(y=8\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, apply action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y=8\\) to \\(y=9\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, the player is at \\(y=9\\), so apply action \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y=9\\). Since \\(y=9\\) is not a freeway, no collision check is needed.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 14 (t=0 relative):** Player at \\(y=6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is occupied only at relative times \\(t=10, 11, 12, 13\\), so at \\(t=0\\), it is safe.\n- **Turn 15 (t=1 relative):** Player at \\(y=7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 has a car with span \\([49 + 24t, 72 + 24t]\\), which never contains 0 for any \\(t\\), so it is safe.\n- **Turn 16 (t=2 relative):** Player at \\(y=8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 has a car with span \\([49 + 24t, 72 + 24t]\\), which never contains 0 for any \\(t\\), so it is safe.\n- **Turn 17 (t=3 relative):** Player at \\(y=9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 14 + 4 - 1 = 17\\) with no collisions. Since moving from \\(y=6\\) to \\(y=9\\) requires at least three up actions, and the player cannot reach \\(y=9\\) before turn 17 (relative turn 3), \\(H=4\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S }",

The current turn is t₁ = 15, and I start at y=7.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Each car is defined by its head, tail, direction, and speed. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)], and for left-moving, it's [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)]. But looking at the data, all cars seem to be right-moving since the direction is \"right\" for all. Let me check.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4), (-40, -51, right, 4). All have direction right. Similarly for others, all are right-moving. So no left-moving cars here. That simplifies things.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y, and you decide to move to y+1 or y-1, at turn T you are still on y for collision purposes, and you arrive at y+1 or y-1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe player update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, you choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at turn t, your position is y_t, and you might collide with cars on row y_t if 0 is in their span at time t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, you move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on current position and the car spans at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T even if 0 is in span at T, but you might at T+1 if you're there.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so collision only with cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so collision with cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe key is that when you are on a freeway at time t, 0 must not be in any car's span on that freeway at time t.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=7 to y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so y=9 should be safe, no cars. Similarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start at y=7.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision possible. But I need to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nSo the goal is to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny ranges from 0 to 9, so from y=7, I can go up to y=8 or down to y=6 or stay at 7.\n\nBut I need to get to y=9, so eventually I need to go up.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=7 to y=9, the shortest path would be two ups: U then U, so H=2 turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions, so I need to check if that's possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, I need to know where I am at each turn and what cars are on that row.\n\nCurrent turn: t₁ = 15, position y=7.\n\nI need actions for turns t=15,16,... up to when I reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote time t relative to t₁. Let τ = T - t₁, so at τ=0, it's turn t₁.\n\nAt τ=0, y=7.\n\nI need to find actions a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, such that after H turns, y_{t₁ + H} =9, but let's see the sequence.\n\nThe player position: at turn t₁, y_{t₁} =7.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, position is y_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t₁ to t₁+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t₁+H, position should be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t₁: U, then y_{t₁+1} =7+1=8, but 8≠9. If I do U, I go to 8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, since from y=8, I need to go up to 9.\n\nFrom y=7, to be at y=9 at turn t, I need to have moved up twice.\n\nAt turn t₁, y=7.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t₁+1, y could be 6,7,8.\n\nAfter two actions, at turn t₁+2, y could be 5,6,7,8,9 depending on actions.\n\nI need y_{t₁+H} =9.\n\nThe minimal H is 2, if I do U at t₁ and U at t₁+1: at turn t₁+1, y=8; at turn t₁+2, y=9.\n\nBut I need to ensure no collision at turns t₁ and t₁+1? No.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on position at that turn.\n\nAt turn t₁, I am at y=7, so I need no collision on row 7 at time t₁.\n\nAt turn t₁+1, if I am at y=8, I need no collision on row 8 at time t₁+1.\n\nAt turn t₁+2, if I am at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut for H=2, at turn t₁+2, I am at y=9, but the collision check at t₁+2 is on y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe turns where I need to worry are when I am on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSpecifically, for the path to (0,9), I need to be safe at each turn until I reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t₁+H, I am at y=9, which is safe, so no issue.\n\nBut for H=2, I need to be safe at turn t₁ (y=7) and turn t₁+1 (y=8, if I go up).\n\nFirst, let's check if at τ=0 (turn t₁=15), on row y=7, are there any cars where 0 is in the span at time T=15.\n\nτ = T - t₁, so at T=15, τ=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need the car spans at time T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, for a car with head h, tail τ (I think τ is tail), direction right, speed s, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nIn the notation, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4), (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, if head is larger, but here for (0, -11), head=0, tail=-11, so tail < head, so the car is from x= -11 to x=0 at time t₁? But direction right, so it's moving right.\n\nAt time T, position: since moving right, span [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut head and tail: for (0, -11), at t₁, span is [ -11 + 0, 0 + 0]? T - t₁ =0 at T=t₁.\n\nAt time T=t₁, τ=0, span is [τ, h] for right-moving? From the update: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAt T=t₁, Span = [τ +0, h+0] = [τ, h]\n\nIn this case, for (0, -11), τ = tail = -11? The notation is (head, tail, ...), so head=0, tail=-11.\n\nSo at t₁, span [tail, head] = [-11, 0]\n\nSimilarly, (36, 25), head=36, tail=25, so span [25,36] at t₁.\n\nBut direction right, so [25,36] is from 25 to 36, which is moving right, but if it's moving right, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head at higher x, so [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn (36,25), 25<36, so [25,36].\n\nSimilarly, (-40,-51), tail=-51, head=-40, so [-51,-40], all consistent.\n\nNow, for freeway 7: (-48, -71, right, 24), so at t₁, span [-71, -48]? Head=-48, tail=-71, so since tail < head, span [τ, h] = [-71, -48].\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nNow, collision at turn T on freeway k if 0 is in Span of any car on k at time T.\n\nSpan is the x-interval where the car is present.\n\nSo for a given freeway and time, if 0 is within [min, max] of the span.\n\nNow, back to the task.\n\nFirst, at turn t₁=15, y=7, so I need to check row 7.\n\nFreeway 7: cars: only one car? From table, freeway 7: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nAt time T=15, τ=0, span = [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-71, -48] for this car.\n\nIs 0 in [-71, -48]? -71 to -48, all negative, 0 not in, so no collision on row 7 at t=15.\n\nGood, so at start, safe.\n\nNow, I want to go up to y=8 immediately.\n\nSuppose I do action U at t₁ (turn 15), so at turn t₁+1=16, I will be at y=8.\n\nAt turn 16, I am on y=8, so I need to check row 8 at time T=16.\n\nFirst, freeway 8: cars: (-48, -71, right, 24) same as row 7? No, freeway 8 has separate cars.\n\nFreeway 8: from table, also (-48, -71, right, 24), same as row 7? No, row 7 and 8 are different freeways.\n\nFreeway 7: one car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nFreeway 8: also (-48,-71,right,24), probably a different car or same, but we treat separately.\n\nAt time T=16, τ = T - t₁ = 16-15=1.\n\nFor freeway 8, car: head=-48, tail=-71, s=24, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T=16: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ=1? T - t₁ =1.\n\nSpan = [tail + s*(T-t₁), head + s*(T-t₁)] = [-71 + 24*1, -48 + 24*1] = [-71 + 24, -48 + 24] = [-47, -24]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-47, -24]? All negative, 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nThus, if I go to y=8 at turn 16, it's safe.\n\nThen, at turn 16, I am at y=8, and I can do another U to go to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo with H=2, actions: a_{15} = U, a_{16} = U.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nAt turn 15: position y=7, action U, so y_{16} = 7+1=8.\n\nAt turn 16: position y=8, action U, so y_{17} =8+1=9.\n\nAt turn 17: position y=9, safe.\n\nNow, at turn 15: on y=7, cars: freeway 7 has car at [-71,-48] at T=15, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 16: on y=8, cars: freeway 8 has car at T=16: span [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 17: on y=9, safe.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut is there any issue? Freeway 7 and 8 both have cars, but we checked.\n\nPerhaps I need to check other rows, but since I'm only on y=7 and y=8 during the path, and both safe at those times.\n\nWhat about the car on row 6? But I'm not on row 6, so no need.\n\nIn this case, H=2 seems possible.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 16 on y=8, is there any other car? Freeway 8 has only one car, I think.\n\nFrom table, freeway 8: only one car listed, (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut freeway 6 has a car: (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nBut I'm not on row 6.\n\nSo for H=2, it should work.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, and 2 is minimal since I need to increase y by 2.\n\nI could go up and then down or something, but that would take more turns, so H=2 should be best.\n\nBut let me check if at the times, the cars might be at x=0.\n\nFor row 7 at T=15: span [-71,-48], not covering 0.\n\nRow 8 at T=16: [-47,-24], not covering 0.\n\nNow, what about row 8 at other times? But I only care about when I'm there.\n\nSimilarly, for row 9, no issue.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nSo with two ups, I can reach.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I stay or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the player starts at (0,7), and cars are on the freeway, but since we are at x=0, we care if the car spans include x=0.\n\nIn the collision condition: if 0 in Span(T) for the freeway.\n\nIn this case, for row 7 at T=15, [-71,-48], min -71, max -48, both <0, so x=0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for row 8 at T=16, [-47,-24], both negative.\n\nNow, but let me see the speed: s=24 for row 7 and 8, which is fast, but at T=15, it's at negative x, moving right.\n\nAt T=16, for row 8, it's at [-47,-24], still left of 0.\n\nWhen will it reach 0? Set head + s(T-t₁) =0 or something.\n\nFor row 8 car, head + s(T-t₁) = -48 + 24(τ) =0 when -48 +24τ=0, 24τ=48, τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, tail + sτ = -71 +24τ, at τ=2, -71+48= -23, still negative? At τ=2, span [ -71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0]\n\nAt τ=2, T= t₁ +2 =17, span [ -71 +24*2, -48 +24*2] = [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0]\n\nSo at T=17, on row 8, 0 is in the span? [ -23, 0 ], so x=0 is included, since it's a closed interval I assume.\n\n[ -23, 0 ] includes 0.\n\nSo at T=17, if I am on row 8, I would collide.\n\nBut in my plan, at T=17, I am at y=9, not on row 8.\n\nAt T=16, I am on row 8, and span is [ -47, -24], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=17, if I were on row 8, it would be dangerous, but I'm not.\n\nSo for my path, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for row 7: car at T=15: [-71,-48]\n\nAt τ=0, T=15\n\nSet head + sτ = -48 +24τ =0, τ=2, T=17.\n\nAt T=17, span [ -71+48, -48+48] = [-23,0] on row 7.\n\nBut at T=17, I am at y=9, not on row 7.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to H=2 path: actions at t=15: U, t=16: U.\n\nBut at turn t=16, I do action U, so at turn t=17, I am at y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions for turns t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=2, actions at t=15 and t=16.\n\nThen at turn t=17, position y=9.\n\nBut t=17 is not in the action sequence, since actions up to t=16.\n\nNow, but in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot do this.\n\nWhat about other freeways? For example, if I go to y=8 at T=16, only row 8 matters.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car, which we checked.\n\nBut let me list all freeways to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 1: cars (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nAt T=15, τ=0, spans: [ -11, 0 ], [25,36], [-51,-40]\n\nNow, [ -11, 0 ] includes 0? -11 to 0, x=0 is included? [ -11, 0 ] means from -11 to 0 inclusive, I assume, so yes, x=0 is part of the car.\n\nAt T=15, on row 1, car (0,-11,right,4) has span [ -11, 0 ], which includes 0.\n\nSo if I were on row 1 at T=15, I would collide, but I'm on row 7.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2: same cars? Freeway 2: (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (-40,-51,right,4) same as row 1.\n\nAt T=15, car (0,-11) has span [ -11, 0 ], includes 0, so row 2 also has collision at x=0 at T=15.\n\nBut I'm not on row 2.\n\nRow 3: cars (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nAt T=15, spans: [ -5, 6 ], [ -41, -30 ], [37,48]\n\n[ -5,6] includes 0? -5 to 6, yes, 0 is between -5 and 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 same.\n\nBut again, not on row 3.\n\nRow 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt T=15, spans: [ -59, -48 ], [25,36], [ -11, 0 ]\n\n[ -11, 0 ] includes 0.\n\nSo row 5 also dangerous at T=15.\n\nRow 6: (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nAt T=15, span [ -38, -27 ], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nRow 7: [-71,-48], 0 not in.\n\nRow 8: at T=15, span for car: [ -71, -48 ], 0 not in.\n\nNow, back to my plan.\n\nFor H=2, it should work.\n\nBut is there a car on row 8 that I missed? No.\n\nPerhaps at T=16 on row 8, we have only one car, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nBut let me check row 6 at T=16, but I'm not on it.\n\nAnother thing: if I do U at t=15, I go to y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut what if I do S or D? That would take longer, so not minimal.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if going up immediately causes problem, but in this case no.\n\nMaybe I can reach in one turn? But from y=7, I can only go to y=6,7,8 in one action, not to 9. So impossible in one turn. H=2 is minimum.\n\nThus, actions: at turn t₁=15: U, then at turn 16: U.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for t=0: a_{t₁} = U, t=1: a_{t₁+1} = U.\n\nThen y_{t₁+2} =9.\n\nNow, but let me write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and I think that's fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if at any point for row 8, the car might be at 0, but at T=16 it's not.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the car on row 6, since I might need to consider if I go down, but I don't.\n\nAnother thought: the player position is given as (0, y), so x=0 always, we only move vertically.\n\nSo only y changes.\n\nNow, I think H=2 is fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 7 and 8 again.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=15, safe.\n\nIf I stay at y=7, what happens.\n\nBut I don't need to.\n\nFor example, at T=16, if I were on row 7, car position: τ=1, span [ -71 +24*1, -48 +24*1] = [-47, -24], 0 not in, still safe.\n\nBut I'm moving up.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17, on row 7, span [-23,0], includes 0, dangerous.\n\nBut I'm not there.\n\nSimilarly for row 8 at T=17: as above, span [-23,0] for row 8 car? Row 8 car: at T=17, τ=2, span [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23,0], includes 0.\n\nBut at T=17, I'm at y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can do only one action if I can, but I can't reach y=9 in one action.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U   (which is turn 15)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U   (turn 16)\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: a_{15}\nTurn 16: a_{16}\n}\n\nBut the turn is t_1, which is 15.\n\nIn the box, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nBut since t_1=15, I can write the numbers.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nBut in the box, I should use the variables or the numbers?\n\nLet me see the answer format.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo it uses t_1, not the number.\n\nBut in the current state, t_1=15 is given.\n\nI think I should use the numbers for clarity, but the format says to use t_1.\n\nPerhaps I can write with t_1.\n\nSince t_1 is given as 15, I can write 15.\n\nI think either is fine, but let's follow the format.\n\nIn the format, it has \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so I should use t_1.\n\nBut in the box, I can write:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nAnd since t_1=15, it's clear.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is any issue with other rows.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going directly up might be blocked, but in this case not.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=15, if I do U, I go to y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, when I am on y=8, is there a car on row 8 that could be at x=0?\n\nWe have only one car on row 8, at T=16, span [-47,-24], no.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6, since it has a car with different speed.\n\nFreeway 6: (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nAt T=15, span [-38,-27], no 0.\n\nAt T=16, τ=1, span [-38+3, -27+3] = [-35,-24], still no 0.\n\nSet -27 + sτ = -27 +3τ =0, τ=9, T=24.\n\nNot relevant.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars that include 0 at T=15, like row 1,2,3,4,5, but I'm not on them.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by going down, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nOr staying, but staying at y=7, I need to go up eventually, so H=2 is best.\n\nSuppose I do S at t=15, stay at y=7, then at t=16, I am still at y=7.\n\nThen at t=16, I can do U to y=8 at t=17.\n\nThen at t=17, do U to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut that takes H=3 turns, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, even worse.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be two ups.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nIn the sequence, since H=2, actions at t=0 and t=1 relative to t_1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=1.\n\nSo two actions.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the player must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn. The minimal \\(H\\) is 2, achieved by moving upward twice.\n\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 15\\), the player is at \\((0, 7)\\). Action \\(U\\) (up) is chosen, moving to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn \\(16\\).\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 16\\), the player is at \\((0, 8)\\). Action \\(U\\) (up) is chosen, moving to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(17\\).\n\nCollision checks:\n- At turn \\(15\\) on freeway \\(y = 7\\): The car span is \\([-71, -48]\\) (from car \\((-48, -71, \\text{right}, 24)\\)). Since \\(0 \\notin [-71, -48]\\), no collision occurs.\n- At turn \\(16\\) on freeway \\(y = 8\\): The car span is \\([-47, -24]\\) (from car \\((-48, -71, \\text{right}, 24)\\)). Since \\(0 \\notin [-47, -24]\\), no collision occurs.\n- At turn \\(17\\), the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 15: a_{15} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: a_{16} = U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. I start at y=8, and the goal is y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above it, I just need to move up once to reach it. But I have to avoid cars on the way, especially when I'm on a freeway row.\n\nThe player update is: I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), and y changes by +1, -1, or 0 accordingly, clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nFor cars, they move left or right at constant speed. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car at that turn. The span is the interval covered by the car.\n\nImportant note: when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T I move from y to y+1, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So for collision at turn T, it depends on where I am at the start of the turn, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is my position at turn T, I assume.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T. Cars on that freeway can collide with me if 0 is in their span at turn T.\n\nIf I move to a different row, at turn T I'm still on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter for collision at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} matter.\n\nIn this case, I start at (0,8) at turn t1=16.\n\nI need to reach (0,9). Since I'm at y=8, and I want to go to y=9, I probably need to move up once. But moving up might take me through freeways or something? y=8 is a freeway, y=9 is the goal, not a freeway.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. y=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top.\n\nIn the player position, y=0 to 9, and freeways for y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when I'm on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be on y=8 and then move up to y=9.\n\nAt some turn, I should be on y=8 and then take action U to go to y=9.\n\nBut when I take U at turn T, from y=8, then at turn T, I am on y=8, so I could collide with cars on freeway 8 if 0 is in their span at turn T.\n\nThen after moving, at turn T+1, I am on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo the key is to be on y=8 at a turn when there is no car on freeway 8 that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThen I can move up safely.\n\nBut I might need to wait or something if it's not safe immediately.\n\nCurrently I am at y=8 at turn 16.\n\nFirst, I need to check if at turn 16, on freeway 8, is there a car that has 0 in its span?\n\nIf not, I can immediately move up to y=9 with action U at turn 16.\n\nThen I reach y=9 at turn 17, but since the action sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and I need to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 16.\n\nPlayer position at turn t1: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8)\n\nI need a sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1 + H - 1, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe position after actions: after action at turn t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nSpecifically, after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at turn t1, I'm at y=8. If I take action S, I stay at y=8 for turn t1+1.\n\nBut I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 1: if at turn 16 I take U, then y_{17} = 8 + 1 = 9, so at turn 17 I am at (0,9).\n\nAnd H=1, since one action.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 16 + H -1 = turn when last action is taken.\n\nAfter last action, at turn t1 + H, position is set.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nWith H actions: actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 determine y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nSo for y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H is 1 if I can move up immediately.\n\nBut I have to avoid collision.\n\nAt turn t1=16, I am on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nI need to check if at turn 16, for freeway 8, is there a car with 0 in its span.\n\nCars on freeway 8: from the table, freeway 8 has: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so it's right-moving.\n\nSpan at time t: for right-moving, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] since at t1, span is [τ, h], so at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the car update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving right, head is larger, tail smaller? No.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, at t1, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], but it says (head h, tail τ), and direction.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so h > τ, and span is [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, head left, h < τ, span [h, τ].\n\nIn this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think.\n\nLook: freeway 8: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nHead h = -24, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed 24.\n\nSince direction right, and h = -24, τ = -47, so h > τ, yes, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -24]\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 24(T-t1), -24 + 24(T-t1)]\n\nCollision at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nAt turn T=16, t1=16, so T-t1=0.\n\nSpan(16) = [-47 + 0, -24 + 0] = [-47, -24]\n\n0 is not in [-47,-24], since -47 to -24, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nSo at turn 16, on freeway 8, no car has 0 in span, since the only car has span [-47,-24], 0 not in it.\n\nTherefore, at turn 16, I can take action U to move to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 17, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nAnd I reached in one step.\n\nBut is that minimal? H=1.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and I do so at turn 17 with one action.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are other cars or something.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car, as above.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway, and I am on it at turn 16.\n\nSince I move to y=9 at turn 17, and y=9 has no cars.\n\nBut at turn 16, when I take action, I am still on y=8, and since no collision, it should be fine.\n\nThen the action sequence is just one action: at turn 16, U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see if I need to output for multiple turns, but H=1, so only one action.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and I need to go to (0,9), so U should do it, if safe.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot?\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if at the moment I move, but according to the rules, collision only depends on the position at the start of the turn.\n\nAnother thing: when I take U at turn 16, I move to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 16, I am on y=8, and no collision, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8: car at t1=16: span [-47,-24], 0 not in it.\n\nSpeed is 24, so it's moving right, but at T=16, it's not at 0.\n\nNow, for other freeways, but since I'm only on y=8 at turn 16, and moving away, I don't care about other rows for collision.\n\nThe collision only matters when I am on the freeway row at that turn.\n\nSo for turn 16, only y=8 matters.\n\nAnd it's safe.\n\nTherefore, I can move up immediately.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in one turn.\n\nBut let me see the car list; there might be something I missed.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car, and it's far left.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the span.\n\nt1=16, car: head h=-24, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed 24.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 24*(T-16), -24 + 24*(T-16)]\n\nAt T=16, [-47, -24], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=17, [-47+24, -24+24] = [-23, 0], which includes 0? -23 to 0, 0 is included.\n\nBut at T=17, if I were on freeway 8, it would collide, but when I take U at T=16, at T=17 I am on y=9, not on freeway 8, so no collision.\n\nEven if I stayed, but I'm moving.\n\nSo for me, at T=16, I'm safe to take U.\n\nThen why is the car list given? Maybe for other positions, but here it seems straightforward.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that y=9 is not reached until after the action, but I think I have it.\n\nMaybe the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), so x=0 always, I think? The grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I believe, since not moving horizontally.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed.\n\nCars are on the freeways, moving horizontally.\n\nSo only y-coordinate changes for player.\n\nIn this case, from y=8 to y=9.\n\nPerhaps for some reason I cannot move up immediately, but here it seems I can.\n\nMaybe I should check if at turn 16, on y=8, is it safe, which it is.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 8 at T=16 has span that includes 0? -47 to -24, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nUnless I misread the numbers.\n\nHead h=-24, tail τ=-47, so span [ -47, -24 ], min -47, max -24, so from -47 to -24, all x <= -24 < 0, so 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nSpeed 24, so it moves right 24 per turn? Speed s, so displacement per turn is s units.\n\nIn the span update, s is the speed, so per turn, it moves s units to the right for right-moving car.\n\nAt T=17, span [ -47 +24, -24 +24] = [-23, 0], which includes 0.\n\nBut I won't be there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action at turn 16: U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, but I don't think they matter.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that I need to go to y=9, but I'm already at y=8, so one up.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? Maybe if I was at lower y, but here I'm at 8.\n\nPerhaps for safety, but the question is to go to y=9 from current position.\n\nAnother thought: when I am at y=8 and move to y=9, at the turn I move, I am still on y=8, so only need that freeway 8 is safe at that turn.\n\nWhich it is.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the position during the move, but the rules don't say that; collision is only at discrete turns based on position.\n\nSo I think H=1 is correct.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states for freeway 8.\n\nIn the table: freeway 8 | (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nYes.\n\nDirection right, so moving right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -24]\n\nAt T=16, same.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSo I can move up.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and when I'm on y=9, it's not a freeway, so ok.\n\nPerhaps y=9 is considered, but the freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut why is there a car with high speed? But not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should check if for some reason I need to wait, but no need.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 16, if I take U, I go to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 17, on y=9, no cars.\n\nBut is there a freeway y=9? No, y=1 to 8 only.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end, and with one action I achieve it.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it should be a sequence.\n\nSo for H=1, only one action: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nThat is turn 16: U\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and perhaps I misread the car.\n\nFreeway 8 has (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nBut at T=16, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are inclusive, but 0 not in.\n\nMaybe the car spans are long, but here it's from -47 to -24, not near 0.\n\nSpeed 24, so at T=17, it will be at [-23,0], so at x=0 it is occupied, but I won't be there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for other turns, but not relevant.\n\nI think I should go with that.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,8) at turn 16.\n\nAction at turn 16: U, then at turn 17, position (0,9), done.\n\nSo minimal H=1.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so for H=1, sequence is just one action.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nSince t1=16.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car? In the table, it says \"Cars\" but for freeway 8, it has only one entry: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 has (-24, -47, right, 24), same as 8? No, different freeway.\n\nFreeway 7: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nBut I am on y=8, not y=7.\n\nSo only y=8 matters for me at turn 16.\n\nFreeway 6 has (-24, -35, right, 3), etc.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I stay or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down or stay, but to reach y=9 from y=8, moving up is the only way, and I can do it now.\n\nSo I think H=1 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if there is any car on other freeways that might affect, but no, because I'm not on them.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, I am on y=8, so only freeway 8 cars can collide, and there is only one, not at 0.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, action at turn 16: U.\n\nThen the sequence is just one line.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 16: U }\n\nBut let's see the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case, since H=1, only one turn.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, and after U, at y=9.\n\nBut is y=9 reachable? Yes.\n\nPerhaps the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways 1 to 8, so y=9 is top, no issue.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 16, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 at turn 16 has a span of \\([-47, -24]\\) (head = -24, tail = -47, direction = right, speed = 24). Since 0 is not in the interval \\([-47, -24]\\), there is no collision at turn 16 if the player is on this freeway.\n\nThe player can take action \\(U\\) (move up) at turn 16. This results in:\n- At turn 16: Player is at \\(y = 8\\) (no collision, as 0 not in car span).\n- After action \\(U\\), at turn 17: Player moves to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nSince \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are only for \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), there are no cars and thus no collision possible at turn 17 or beyond.\n\nThus, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 17 with \\(H = 1\\) action. No other sequence can achieve the goal in fewer turns, as moving up is the only way to increase \\(y\\) from 8 to 9, and it is safe to do so immediately.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 16: \\(U\\)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U\n}",
