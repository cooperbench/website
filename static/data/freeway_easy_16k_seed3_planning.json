        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 1. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed. Also, if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so they only check collision for the current y at each turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn t_1=1 to some turn H where y_H = 9, and H is minimized.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their states at turn t_1=1. I'll denote the span at turn t for each car.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars listed. Let's parse the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, the span at turn t_1=1 is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so as time increases, the position increases. From the update rule: right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt turn T, for a right-moving car, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: head h, tail τ. But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for direction: right or left.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and then Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook at the text:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSo head h = -48, tail τ = -95, direction right.\n\nSince direction is right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T).\n\ny_T is the vertical position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway k = y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that if the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are on y_T at turn T, and only start on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision, at each turn, we only care about the current y at that turn.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T), and collision is checked for that y_T and turn T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway at t_1=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-48, τ=-95, d=right, s=48\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: first (-48, -59, right, 12) and second (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)  // head 48, tail 83? That seems odd.\n\nFor left-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see.\n\nIn general, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h should be the right end, τ the left end, I think.\n\nFor freeway 5: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nh=48, τ=83, d=left.\n\nSince left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83]? But 48 < 83, so [48,83], which means from 48 to 83, and since left-moving, it will move left, so decreasing.\n\nSpan(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48], which is from left to right.\n\nIn terms of position, the span covers from min to max.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in [min, max] of the span at time T.\n\nNow back to freeway 5: (48,83,left,36), so at t_1, Span = [48,83], and since left, moving left, so min decreasing, max decreasing.\n\nBut 48 to 83, with speed 36, it will take time to reach near 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: (-48,-59,right,4)  // one car\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nFreeway 2 has two cars, both on y=2.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t_1=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum H to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if we move up every turn. But we might have to avoid cars, so we might need to stay or move down sometimes, which could increase H.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should try to go up as much as possible, only deviating when necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, to avoid collisions, we need to ensure that when we are on a freeway y at turn T, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince the cars are moving, we need to compute for each freeway, at what times 0 is covered by a car, so that we should not be on that freeway at those times.\n\nBut the time depends on when we arrive, so we need to plan the path.\n\nSince the grid is small (y from 0 to 9), and time might not be too large, we can think about the state over time.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is \"occupied\", meaning that there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t_1, with t_1=1.\n\nSo for each car, at turn T = t_1 + ΔT, Span(T) depends on ΔT.\n\n0 is in Span(T) if min ≤ 0 ≤ max.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, 0 is covered if low(T) ≤ 0 ≤ high(T), where low and high are the min and max of the span.\n\nThen for a freeway, if at least one car has 0 covered, then the freeway is occupied at that turn.\n\nOtherwise, it is safe.\n\nPlayer can be on a freeway only when it is safe.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways; freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSo we start at y=0, turn 1, safe.\n\nGoal y=9, safe.\n\nWe need to go through y=1 to 8, but only when safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway k=1 to 8, the set of turns T when it is occupied.\n\nSince turns are discrete, we can find for each k, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, define ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 1, so at turn T, ΔT = T-1.\n\nSet t = ΔT = T - 1, so at turn T, t = T-1.\n\nThen for each car, Span at turn T corresponds to t = T-1.\n\nAt turn T, ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 1.\n\nSet τ = T - 1, so τ is the time offset from t_1.\n\nFor turn T, τ = T - 1.\n\nThen for a car, at time offset τ, Span = ...\n\nLet's compute per freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, right-moving, h=-48, τ=-95, s=48, d=right\n\nSpan at τ: [τ_car + s τ, h + s τ] where τ_car is tail, h is head? In notation, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] with ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSo with ΔT = τ (since τ = T - t_1)\n\nSo Span(τ) = [τ_car + s τ, h + s τ] = [-95 + 48τ, -48 + 48τ]\n\n0 is in span if -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nFirst: -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 48τ ≤ 95 ⇒ τ ≤ 95/48 = 1.979... so τ ≤ 1 since integer? τ is integer? Turns are discrete, so τ integer? t_1=1, T integer, so ΔT integer, yes.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ ⇒ 48τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 1\n\nSo 0 in span when τ ≥ 1 and τ ≤ 1.979, so τ=1\n\nSince τ integer, τ=1.\n\nτ=1: low = -95 + 48*1 = -95 + 48 = -47\n\nhigh = -48 + 48*1 = 0\n\nSo span [-47, 0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nτ=2: low = -95 + 96 = 1, high = -48 + 96 = 48, so [1,48], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nτ=0: low = -95 + 0 = -95, high = -48, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=1, which is turn T = t_1 + τ = 1 + 1 = 2? τ = ΔT = T - t_1, at τ, turn is t_1 + τ.\n\nAt τ=0, turn T = t_1 + 0 = 1\n\nτ=1, T=2\n\nτ=2, T=3, etc.\n\nFor freeway 1 car, 0 in span only at τ=1, i.e., turn T=2.\n\nSo freeway 1 is occupied only at turn 2.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan(τ) = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12τ\n\nFirst: -59 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so τ ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 12τ ⇒ 12τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 4\n\nSo τ ≥ 4 and τ ≤ 4.916, so τ=4\n\nAt τ=4: low = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=5: low = -59 + 60 =1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan(τ) = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ] = [-11 + 12τ, 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nFirst: -11 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 11 ⇒ τ ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so τ ≤ 0\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 12τ always true for τ ≥ 0, but since τ integer, τ ≥ 0.\n\nτ ≤ 0 and τ ≥ 0, so τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0: low = -11 + 0 = -11, high = 0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nFor τ=0, which is turn T=1.\n\nNow, for freeway 2, first car occupied at τ=4 (T=5), second car at τ=0 (T=1).\n\nSince there are two cars, freeway 2 is occupied if either car covers 0.\n\nSo at τ=0 (T=1), occupied by second car.\n\nAt τ=4 (T=5), occupied by first car.\n\nAt other times, not occupied.\n\nτ=0: T=1, occupied\n\nτ=4: T=5, occupied\n\nNow freeway 3: one car (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=3\n\nSpan(τ) = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-59 + 3τ, -48 + 3τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ\n\nFirst: -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 3τ ≤ 59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, τ ≤ 19\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ ⇒ 3τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 16\n\nSo τ ≥ 16 and τ ≤ 19.666, so τ=16,17,18,19\n\nAt τ=16: low = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0, [-11,0]\n\nτ=17: low = -59 + 51 = -8, high = -48 + 51 = 3, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nτ=18: low = -59 + 54 = -5, high = -48 + 54 = 6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=19: low = -59 + 57 = -2, high = -48 + 57 = 9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nτ=20: low = -59 + 60 =1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at τ=16,17,18,19, i.e., turns T=17,18,19,20\n\nT = t_1 + τ = 1 + τ\n\nτ=16, T=17; τ=17,T=18; τ=18,T=19; τ=19,T=20\n\nNow freeway 4: similar to freeway 3, one car (-48,-59,right,3), same as above.\n\nSo also occupied at τ=16,17,18,19, T=17,18,19,20\n\nNow freeway 5: (48,83,left,36)\n\nh=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36\n\nFor left-moving, Span(τ) = [h - s τ, τ - s τ]?

Similarly for y=9 and U.\n\nI think we should assume that y is clamped, so at y=0, D has no effect, y stays 0; at y=9, U has no effect.\n\nIn the rule: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so it must be within bounds.\n\nSo for action D at y=0, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0.\n\nSimilarly for U at y=9.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nAt T=1, y=0, safe.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- S: stay, y=0 at T=2\n\n- D: down, but y=0, so y=0 at T=2\n\n- U: up, y=1 at T=2\n\nBut at T=2, if y=1, it is occupied, so collision. So we cannot go to y=1 at T=2.\n\nTherefore, at T=1, we cannot move up; we must stay or down, but both result in y=0 at T=2.\n\nSo at T=1, action must be S or D, but since y=0, D same as S, so effectively, we stay at y=0 for T=2.\n\nNow at T=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, what about y=1? It was only occupied at T=2, so for T>2, y=1 is safe, since no other cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 occupied only at T=3, etc.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nNow we can choose action for T=2 to go to T=3.\n\nIf we move up, at T=3, y=1.\n\nNow, is y=1 safe at T=3? From above, y=1 only unsafe at T=2, so at T=3, safe. Yes.\n\nIf we stay or down, y=0 at T=3.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, also, at T=3, y=5 is occupied, but we are not on y=5 yet.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=1 and T=5\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=17,18,19,20\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=17,18,19,20\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=3\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\nNow, we start at T=1, y=0.\n\nAt T=1, we must not go to y=1 because... at T=1, we are at y=0, and we choose action for this turn, which affects y at next turn.\n\nLet's think in terms of when we arrive at each y.\n\nSince we can only change y by 1 each turn, the sequence of y positions must be non-decreasing or with some downs, but to minimize turns, we should avoid downs if possible.\n\nMinimal path is to go straight up, but we have to avoid certain (y,T) pairs.\n\nDefine the time when we are at each position.\n\nSet t as turn number, starting from t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t=H.\n\nThe y sequence must satisfy that at each turn, when on a freeway y=1 to 8, it must not be unsafe at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, let's find a path.\n\nStart t=1, y=0.\n\nAt t=1, action: we must not move up because if we do, at t=2, y=1 which is unsafe.\n\nSo at t=1, we do S or D, both keep y=0 at t=2.\n\nSo effectively, we stay at y=0 for now.\n\nAt t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, at t=2, we can move up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nBecause at t=3, y=1 is safe (only unsafe at t=2).\n\nIf we stay, y=0 at t=3, but then delayed.\n\nSo better to move up.\n\nSo at t=2, action U: y=3 = y_2 +1? y at t=3.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + delta, based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), and we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision checked at each turn for that y_t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we check if for freeway k=y_t, if occupied at turn t.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nIn this case, at t=1, y_t = y1 =0, which is safe.\n\nWe choose a1, which sets y2.\n\nIf a1=U, y2=1, then at t=2, y2=1, and we check collision at t=2 for y=1, which is occupied, so collision. Not allowed.\n\nTherefore, a1 cannot be U; must be S or D, so y2=0.\n\nThen at t=2, y_t = y2=0, safe.\n\nNow choose a2: if a2=U, then y3=1.\n\nAt t=3, y3=1, check collision: y=1 only unsafe at t=2, not t=3, so safe.\n\nIf a2=S, y3=0, or D, y3=0.\n\nBut we need to go up, so better U.\n\nSo a2=U, y3=1.\n\nNow at t=3, y3=1, safe.\n\nNow choose a3 for y4.\n\nPossible: U to y4=2, or S to y4=1, or D to y4=0.\n\nNow, if we go to y4=2 at t=4.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at t=5, not at t=4? y=2 unsafe at T=1 and T=5.\n\nAt t=4, if we are on y=2 at turn 4, is it safe?\n\nUnsafe at T=1 and T=5, so at T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe at T=3.\n\nAt t=3, we are at y=1, so for y=5, not relevant now.\n\nSo at t=3, we can go to y4=2 by U.\n\nThen at t=4, y4=2, which is safe (since unsafe only t=1 and t=5).\n\nNow, at t=4, we are at y=2.\n\nNow choose a4 for y5.\n\nIf we go up, y5=3.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=17-20, which are late, so at t=5, y=3 should be safe.\n\nt=5 is early, not 17-20.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 is unsafe at t=5, but at t=5, if we are on y=2, it would be unsafe, but we are at t=4 now, setting y5.\n\nIf a4=U, y5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, y5=3, which is safe, since unsafe only later.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at t=5, but we are not on y=2 at t=5 if we move.\n\nAt t=4, we are at y=2.\n\nIf we set a4=U, then at t=5, we are at y5=3.\n\nSo at t=5, we are on y=3, not y=2.\n\ny=2 at t=5 is unsafe, but since we are not on it, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=5 is safe.\n\nSo we can go to y5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, y5=3, safe.\n\nNow continue.\n\nWe can keep going up.\n\nBut we have to check for higher y.\n\ny=5 is unsafe at t=3, but t=3 is past.\n\ny=6,7,8 unsafe at t=13,14,15.\n\nWe are at t=5, y=3.\n\nIf we go up each turn:\n\nt=5, y=3, set a5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6, y=4, set a6=U, y7=5\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at t=3, which is past, so at t=6 or t=7, it should be safe.\n\nAt t=6, if y6=4, safe.\n\na6=U, y7=5.\n\nAt t=7, y7=5, check: y=5 unsafe only at t=3, not t=7, so safe.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8, y8=6, now y=6 unsafe at t=13,14,15, t=8 is before, so safe.\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9, y9=7, safe? y=7 unsafe at t=13-15, t=9<13, safe.\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10, y10=8, y=8 unsafe at t=13-15, t=10<13, safe.\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nt=11, y11=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point we were on unsafe position.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nStart t=1, y=0\n\na1: since cannot U, must S or D, so y2=0\n\nAt t=1, action a1: if S or D, y2=0\n\nThen t=2, y=0\n\na2: U, so y3=1\n\nt=3, y=1\n\na3: U, y4=2\n\nt=4, y=2\n\na4: U, y5=3\n\nt=5, y=3\n\na5: U, y6=4\n\nt=6, y=4\n\na6: U, y7=5\n\nt=7, y=5\n\na7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8, y=6\n\na8: U, y9=7\n\nt=9, y=7\n\na9: U, y10=8\n\nt=10, y=8\n\na10: U, y11=9\n\nt=11, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check for each turn, collision:\n\nt=1: y=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=1, safe (unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=4: y=2, safe (unsafe t=1 and t=5, not t=4)\n\nt=5: y=3, safe (unsafe t=17-20, not t=5)\n\nt=6: y=4, safe (unsafe t=17-20, not t=6)\n\nt=7: y=5, safe (unsafe only t=3)\n\nt=8: y=6, safe (unsafe t=13-15, t=8<13)\n\nt=9: y=7, safe (t=9<13)\n\nt=10: y=8, safe (t=10<13)\n\nt=11: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe, and H=11 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal? We started from y=0 at t=1, and reached y=9 at t=11, so 10 actions? Let's see the sequence.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=10, for y from t=2 to t=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=1 to t=10, 10 actions, y from 0 to 9, but we had one stay at beginning.\n\ny at t=1:0, t=2:0 (after a1=S or D), t=3:1 (after a2=U), t=4:2, t=5:3, t=6:4, t=7:5, t=8:6, t=9:7, t=10:8, t=11:9.\n\nSo from t=1 to t=11, 11 turns, with actions at t=1 to t=10.\n\nH is the number of turns? The sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I think.\n\nIn the answer format, it says: sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=1, so actions from a1 to a_{1 + H -1}, and y at turn (1 + H -1) = H should be 9? Let's see.\n\nThe player position at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to something.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, go to turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, we have the position.\n\nIn this case, t_1=1, we want y_{1+H} =9.\n\nIn our path, at turn t=11, y=9, so 1+H=11, H=10.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence: t=1 to t=10 actions.\n\nNow, in the path above, we have a1: S or D (to stay at 0), a2:U to go to 1, a3:U to 2, ..., up to a10:U to 9.\n\na10:U at t=10, y11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut we used 10 actions, but from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 actions if no delay, but we had one delay at start, so 10 actions, 11 turns? Turns from t=1 to t=11, with actions at each turn except the last? No.\n\nTurns: at each turn, we perform an action and move to next position.\n\nTurn t: we are at y_t, perform action a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, collision based on y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, we start at turn t_1=1, y1=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, with no delay: if we can move up each turn from t=1: a1=U, y2=1; a2=U, y3=2; ... a9=U, y10=9, so at turn 10, y=9, with H=9 actions.\n\nBut in this case, at t=2, y2=1, which was unsafe, so we couldn't.\n\nIn our path, we have y1=0, a1=S (say), y2=0; then a2=U, y3=1; a3=U, y4=2; ... a9=U, y10=8? Let's list:\n\nt=1: y1=0, a1=S, y2=0\n\nt=2: y2=0, a2=U, y3=1\n\nt=3: y3=1, a3=U, y4=2\n\nt=4: y4=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nt=5: y5=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6: y6=4, a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y7=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y8=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y9=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10: y10=8, a10=U, y11=9\n\nSo at turn t=11, y=9, with actions from t=1 to t=10, H=10 actions.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 10, we would need y10=9, but in this case, we reached at turn 11.\n\nIs it possible to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we could go up at t=1, but we couldn't because y=1 unsafe at t=2.\n\nPerhaps we can go up later but faster, but since we can only move one per turn, it's impossible to reach before turn 10, but turn 10 would require starting up at t=1, which we can't.\n\nMinimal possible H: since from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 moves up, so minimal H=9, but only if we can start moving up immediately.\n\nBut at t=1, if we move up, we go to y=1 at t=2, which is unsafe, so impossible to have y=9 at t=10 with H=9.\n\nNext is H=10, reaching at t=11.\n\nIn our path, we reached at t=11 with H=10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we passed all y from 1 to 8 at times when they were safe.\n\ny=1 at t=3, safe\n\ny=2 at t=4, safe (unsafe at t=1 and t=5, not t=4)\n\ny=3 at t=5, safe\n\ny=4 at t=6, safe\n\ny=5 at t=7, safe\n\ny=6 at t=8, safe\n\ny=7 at t=9, safe\n\ny=8 at t=10, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut we have y=6,7,8 at t=8,9,10, which are before t=13, so safe.\n\nBut what about later y? For example, y=3 and y=4 are unsafe at late times, but we passed early, so fine.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=1, instead of staying, can we do something else? But we have to stay or down, same.\n\nPerhaps we can move down, but at y=0, down does nothing, so no.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can avoid the initial delay.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=1, we stay, but then at t=2, we are at y=0, and we can go up to y=1 at t=3, as before.\n\nBut at t=2, y=0, instead of going up immediately, we could stay or something, but that would delay further, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but in this path, we didn't hit any unsafe time.\n\nBut we need to check y=2 at t=5 unsafe, but in our path, at t=5, we are at y=3, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=3 unsafe, but at t=3, we were at y=1.\n\nAll fine.\n\nIn the path, at t=5, y=3, but y=2 is unsafe at t=5, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nNow, but we have to consider that for y=6,7,8, they are unsafe at t=13,14,15.\n\nIn our path, we are on them at t=8,9,10, which are before, so safe.\n\nBut if we were later, it might be unsafe, but we are early.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3,4, unsafe late, but we are early.\n\nSo this path seems fine.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), and we did at t=11.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have a1: S or D, but since y=0, D same as S, so we can choose S for simplicity.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at the beginning, we have one S, then nine U.\n\nFrom a1 to a10: a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9.\n\nBut a1=S, y2=0; a2=U, y3=1; ... up to a10=U, y11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=10 actions, 11 turns.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we don't have the initial delay, but we must have it.\n\nAnother thing: at t=4, we are at y=2, and y=2 is unsafe at t=5.\n\nIf we had stayed at y=2, but we didn't, we moved up.\n\nBut in this case, we moved up, so at t=5, we are at y=3.\n\nSuppose we do something else, but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not staying, but we have to stay at start.\n\nMinimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's check the car on freeway 2 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=2 is unsafe, but we are not on it at t=1, we are on y=0.\n\nAt t=1, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\nThe issue is only when moving to y=1 at t=2.\n\nI think H=10 is minimal.\n\nIn the path, we used all U after the first S.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t_1=1.\n\nSo actions from turn 1 to turn 10? H=10 actions.\n\nSequence: a1, a2, ..., a10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, at turn t_1=1: action a_{t_1} = a1, which is S (or D, but S is fine)\n\nThen turn t_1 +1 =2: a2=U\n\nt_1 +2=3: a3=U\n\n...\n\nup to t_1 +9=10: a10=U\n\nt from 0 to H-1, with H=10.\n\nt=0: t_1 +0 =1, a1\n\nt=1: t_1 +1=2, a2\n\n...\n\nt=9: t_1 +9=10, a10\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1? t_1 + H -1 =1+10-1=10, but position at turn after action, I think.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1 + H =11, y11=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, so indices t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=10, actions at turns: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nWith a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nIn the answer, we need to write:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut is there any problem with later times? For example, if we were slower, we might hit the unsafe times for y=6,7,8 at t=13-15, but in this path, we are at y=8 at t=10, which is before t=13, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving later but still reach in 10 actions? For example, if we stay more, H increases.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=3, but we were there at t=7, fine.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 2, there is a car at t=5, but we are not on y=2 at t=5.\n\nIn our path, at t=5, we are on y=3.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, about the action at turn 1: we used S, but could we use D? At y=0, D also keeps y=0, so same as S. We can use S.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions except first are U.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the initial stay by moving down, but at y=0, down is same as stay.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence: a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }\n\nBut Turn 10 is t_1 + 9, since t_1=1, t=9: turn 10.\n\nH=10, actions from turn 1 to 10.\n\nThe position at turn 11 is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, we have 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in 9 actions, but impossible because of the initial block.\n\nSuppose at t=1, we stay, but that's what we did.\n\nPerhaps move to other y, but we have to go through y=1.\n\nAnother idea: at t=1, since y=0, we can only stay or down, same.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's double-check the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=1 is unsafe, so we cannot be there.\n\nIn our path, we are at y=1 at t=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe at t=1 and t=5: at t=1, we are at y=0; at t=5, we are at y=3, not y=2.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=3: at t=3, we are at y=1, not y=5.\n\ny=6,7,8 unsafe at t=13,14,15: we are at y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, y=8 at t=10, all before t=13.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, this should be the minimal.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2, at t=1, it is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy Times\nThe occupancy times (when a car covers position \\(x = 0\\)) for each freeway are derived from the car states at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\):\n- **Freeway 1**: Occupied at turn 2 only.\n- **Freeway 2**: Occupied at turns 1 and 5.\n- **Freeway 3**: Occupied at turns 17, 18, 19, and 20.\n- **Freeway 4**: Occupied at turns 17, 18, 19, and 20.\n- **Freeway 5**: Occupied at turn 3 only.\n- **Freeway 6**: Occupied at turns 13, 14, and 15.\n- **Freeway 7**: Occupied at turns 13, 14, and 15.\n- **Freeway 8**: Occupied at turns 13, 14, and 15.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\n- The minimal number of turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\) is 9 if moving up every turn, but this is impossible due to collisions. Specifically:\n  - At turn 1, moving up would place the player at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2, but \\(y = 1\\) is occupied at turn 2 (collision).\n  - Thus, the player must stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 2 (using action S or D; S is chosen for simplicity).\n- After staying at turn 1, the player moves up consistently from turn 2 to turn 10, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- This path uses 10 actions (turns 1 to 10) and reaches the goal at turn 11 (\\(H = 10\\) actions, with position at turn \\(t_1 + H = 11\\) being (0, 9)).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification\n- **Turn 1**: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- **Turn 2**: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- **Turn 3**: \\(y = 1\\) (safe; occupied only at turn 2).\n- **Turn 4**: \\(y = 2\\) (safe; occupied at turns 1 and 5, not 4).\n- **Turn 5**: \\(y = 3\\) (safe; occupied at turns 17–20, not 5).\n- **Turn 6**: \\(y = 4\\) (safe; occupied at turns 17–20, not 6).\n- **Turn 7**: \\(y = 5\\) (safe; occupied only at turn 3).\n- **Turn 8**: \\(y = 6\\) (safe; occupied at turns 13–15, not 8).\n- **Turn 9**: \\(y = 7\\) (safe; occupied at turns 13–15, not 9).\n- **Turn 10**: \\(y = 8\\) (safe; occupied at turns 13–15, not 10).\n- **Turn 11**: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no freeway).\n\n### Minimal Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for \\(H = 10\\) (turns 1 to 10) is:\n- Turn 1: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 2, avoiding collision at \\(y = 1\\) on turn 2.\n- Turns 2 to 10: Move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 10\\) actions, as any fewer actions would require reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10, which is impossible due to the collision at turn 2 if moving up at turn 1.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 2. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nThe key point is that when moving between freeways, at turn T, if you move to a different y, you are only on y_T at turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, since the player moves instantly in terms of position, but the collision check is per turn based on the current y.\n\nNow, I need to find the shortest path from y=0 to y=9, avoiding being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1=2, and then for future turns, we can compute when they cover x=0.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=2.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=2.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, and for each car on that freeway, I have (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. In the update:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so head increases.\n\nIn the table, for left-moving cars, the span is given as [head, tail], and for right-moving, it's [tail, head]? Let me check the notation.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nh and τ, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the right, I think. Let's clarify.\n\nTypically, head might be the front, but here it's defined by the direction.\n\nFor left-moving: at T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, the whole car is shifting left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the initial state, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end? I'm confused.\n\nLook at the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so according to right-moving update: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? But it says (0, -47, right, 48), so head=0, tail=-47? But for right-moving, head should be the front, which is right, so if it's moving right, head should be larger.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail.\n\nBut head and tail depend on direction.\n\nFor simplicity, let's think in terms of the position.\n\nFor a car, at turn t_1, we have left_end and right_end, but it's given as head and tail, which might be direction-specific.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll define for each car the position at t_1 and direction, then at time T, the span is [left(T), right(T)].\n\nFor a car moving left (d=left), at t_1, head is the right end, tail is the left end? From the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince h and τ are positions, and s is speed, (T-t_1) is time steps.\n\nAt T=t_1, [h, τ] , so for left-moving, at t_1, the span is from h to τ, but since it's moving left, h should be the right end, so h > τ, I think.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nLet's look at the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1, head=0, tail=-47, so span is from tail to head? But for right-moving, the car is moving right, so head is at 0, tail at -47, so the left end is -47, right end is 0.\n\nAt time T, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-2), 0 + 48(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 5: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1, head=12, tail=47? But if it's moving left, head should be on the right, so head=47, tail=12? The notation says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for left-moving, (12,47,left,36), but 12 and 47, if head is 12 and tail is 47, but for left-moving, the car should have head on the right, so if moving left, head at 47, tail at 12? But here it's given as (12,47), so head=12, tail=47, which would mean left end 12, right end 47, but moving left, so head at 47? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read the update carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAt t_1, span is [h, τ], so if h and τ are positions, [min, max] or what?\n\nIn the example, for freeway 5: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, and direction left.\n\nAt t_1, span is [12,47], so from 12 to 47.\n\nMoving left, so at time T, span is [12 - 36(T-t_1), 47 - 36(T-t_1)].\n\nSince it's moving left, the positions decrease, so at T, left end is 12 - 36(T-2), right end is 47 - 36(T-2).\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: (0,-47,right,48), at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0] for right-moving, since it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), but in the update, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, but tail is left, head is right.\n\nSo for freeway 1: head=0, tail=-47, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [-47, 0].\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-2), 0 + 48(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T, meaning left(T) <= 0 <= right(T).\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at t=2, but y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision. The player is at y=0 at t=2, which is safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, also safe.\n\nWe need to move from y=0 to y=9 through y=1 to 8, avoiding being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince the player can move up, down, or stay, we need to choose a sequence of actions to change y.\n\nMinimal turns: since y changes by at most 1 per turn, to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 moves if we always go up, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=2 to t=2+H-1, so at turn t=2+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that for the freeway k=y_T, no car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, if we move, we are on y_T at turn T, and we set y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, so at turn T, we are on y_T, and we decide action for y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it's only at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway k, the times when it is occupied, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nFor each car, find the time interval when 0 is in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need the union for each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t_1=2.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1 = T - 2, so τ >=0, τ is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nAt time τ (from start), which is turn T = τ + 2.\n\nFor each car, the span at time τ is:\n\nFor a car, at τ=0, span as given.\n\nThen for left-moving: left(τ) = h - s τ, right(τ) = τ - s τ? No.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nAt time T, τ = T - t_1, so Span(T) for left-moving: [h - s τ, τ - s τ]? τ is used for time, but tail is also τ, confusing.\n\nUse t for time offset.\n\nSet t = T - t_1, so t=0 at current turn.\n\nFor a car:\n\n- If direction left: at time t, span [h - s t, τ - s t] where h and τ are from state.\n\nIn notation, for left-moving, head and tail, but head is the right end? In freeway 5, (12,47,left,36), at t=0, span [12,47], moving left, so at time t, left end = 12 - 36t, right end = 47 - 36t.\n\n0 in span if left end <= 0 <= right end, so 12 - 36t <= 0 and 0 <= 47 - 36t, so 12 - 36t <= 0 => 36t >= 12 => t >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nAnd 0 <= 47 - 36t => 36t <= 47 => t <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nSince t integer (turns), t >= ceil(1/3) = 1? t is integer, so 12 - 36t <= 0 => t >= 1 since for t=0, 12-0=12>0, t=1, 12-36= -24 <=0\n\n0 <= 47-36t, for t=0, 47>0, t=1, 47-36=11>0, t=2, 47-72= -25<0, so 0 <= 47-36t for t <= floor(47/36)=1 since 47/36≈1.305, so t=0,1\n\nBut from left: t >= ceil(12/36) = ceil(1/3) =1\n\nFrom right: t <= floor(47/36) =1\n\nSo at t=1, occupied.\n\nt=0: left=12, right=47, 0 not in [12,47], since 0<12\n\nt=1: left=12-36= -24, right=47-36=11, so -24 <=0<=11, yes\n\nt=2: left=12-72= -60, right=47-72= -25, 0 not in [-60,-25]\n\nSo only at t=1, for this car on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nNow let's list all freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, at t=0, span [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? τ=tail=-47, h=head=0\n\nAt time t, for right-moving: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 + 48t, 0 + 48t]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 48t <= 0 <= 48t\n\nFrom left: -47 +48t <=0 => 48t <=47 => t <= 47/48 ≈ 0.979, so for integer t, t=0 since t<=0.979\n\nt=0: -47 <=0<=0, 0<=0 true, so at t=0, 0 is in span.\n\nt=1: -47+48=1, 0+48=48, so 1<=0<=48? 0<1, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,48]\n\nSo only at t=0 for freeway 1.\n\nt=0 is turn t_1=2.\n\nAt turn T=2, for freeway 1, car covers x=0.\n\nBut player is at y=0 at t=2, not on freeway 1, so no collision. Freeway 1 is y=1, I think.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt t=2, player at y=0, not on any freeway, so safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so at t=0, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? tail=-47, head=-36? Given (-36, -47, right, 12), so head=-36, tail=-47.\n\nSince right-moving, head is right end, tail left end, so at t=0, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt time t, [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 + 12t, -36 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12t <= 0 <= -36 +12t\n\nFrom left: -47+12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈3.916, so t<=3\n\nFrom right: 0 <= -36 +12t => 12t >=36 => t>=3\n\nSo for t=3: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nt=2: -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nt=4: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only t=3.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (12, 1, right, 12)\n\n(12, 1, right, 12), so head=12, tail=1? But tail should be left, head right, but 12>1, so tail=1, head=12.\n\nAt t=0, span [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt time t, [1 + 12t, 12 + 12t]\n\n0 in span: 1+12t <=0 <=12+12t? But 1+12t >=1 >0 for t>=0, so 0 cannot be <= left end since left end min 1, so never covered. 0 not in [1+12t, 12+12t] for any t.\n\nSo only first car matters, occupied at t=3.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so head=-45, tail=-56? (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nAt t=0, span [τ, h] = [-56, -45]\n\nAt time t, [-56 + 3t, -45 + 3t]\n\n0 in span: -56 +3t <=0 <= -45 +3t\n\nLeft: -56+3t <=0 => 3t <=56 => t<=56/3≈18.666, t<=18\n\nRight: 0 <= -45+3t => 3t >=45 => t>=15\n\nSo for t=15 to 18.\n\nt=15: -56+45= -11, -45+45=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nt=16: -56+48= -8, -45+48=3, -8<=0<=3, yes\n\nt=17: -56+51= -5, -45+51=6, -5<=0<=6, yes\n\nt=18: -56+54= -2, -45+54=9, -2<=0<=9, yes\n\nt=19: -56+57=1, -45+57=12, 0<1, no\n\nt=14: -56+42= -14, -45+42= -3, 0 not in [-14,-3]\n\nSo occupied t=15 to 18.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (-45, -56, right, 3) identical, so same times t=15 to 18.\n\nFreeway 5: (12,47,left,36) as before, only t=1 occupied.\n\nFreeway 6: (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, head=-44, tail=-55? (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nAt t=0, span [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nAt time t, [-55 + 4t, -44 + 4t]\n\n0 in span: -55+4t <=0 <= -44+4t\n\nLeft: -55+4t <=0 => 4t <=55 => t<=13.75, t<=13\n\nRight: 0 <= -44+4t => 4t >=44 => t>=11\n\nSo t=11,12,13\n\nt=11: -55+44= -11, -44+44=0, -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nt=12: -55+48= -7, -44+48=4, -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nt=13: -55+52= -3, -44+52=8, -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nt=14: -55+56=1, -44+56=12, 0<1, no\n\nt=10: -55+40= -15, -44+40= -4, no\n\nSo occupied t=11,12,13\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (-44, -55, right, 4) identical, so t=11,12,13\n\nFreeway 8: also (-44, -55, right, 4) same, t=11,12,13\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, the times (t) when occupied, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nt is time offset from current, so at turn T = t + 2.\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied only at t=0 (but t=0 is current turn, player not there)\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at t=3\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied t=15 to 18\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied t=15 to 18\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at t=1\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied t=11,12,13\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied t=11,12,13\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied t=11,12,13\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=0 (turn 2), which is safe.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny-position changes with actions.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but only when not occupied at that time.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, we might wait or go down to avoid.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid occupied times.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, S, which sets y for next turn.\n\nAt turn T, we have y_T, and we choose a_T to set y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we are on y_T, so we need y_T not occupied at time t = T-2.\n\nDefine the time t for the turn.\n\nSet t as the time offset, t=0,1,2,... corresponding to turns T=2,3,4,...\n\nAt time t, turn T=t+2, position y_t.\n\ny_t must be between 0 and 9.\n\nIf y_t is between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at time t.\n\ny_t=0 or y_t=9 are always safe.\n\nStart at t=0, y_0 = 0\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H, with minimal H.\n\nThe sequence: from t=0 to t=H, but at t=H, y_H=9.\n\nThe actions are for each turn, from t=0 to t=H-1, I think.\n\nDefine actions.\n\nAt time t (starting from t=0), we are at position y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with delta y = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S.\n\nBut for collision, at time t, if y_t in [1,8], must not be occupied at t.\n\nThe occupation times are fixed for each freeway.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence y_0, y_1, ..., y_H with y_0=0, y_H=9, and |y_{t+1} - y_t| <=1, and for each t, if y_t in [1,8], then y_t not occupied at t.\n\nThen minimize H.\n\nSince y changes slowly, we can think in terms of when we can be on each row.\n\nFirst, list the occupied times for each k:\n\nk=1: occ at t=0 only (but y=1 not occupied at t=0? k=1 occupied at t=0, meaning if on y=1 at t=0, collision, but at t=0, y_0=0, not on k=1.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: occ at t=3\n\nk=3: occ t=15,16,17,18\n\nk=4: occ t=15,16,17,18\n\nk=5: occ at t=1\n\nk=6: occ t=11,12,13\n\nk=7: occ t=11,12,13\n\nk=8: occ t=11,12,13\n\nk=5 occupied only at t=1.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, we need to pass through each y, but we can skip some by moving diagonally? No, since we move to adjacent y or same, so we must visit each y from 0 to 9 in order, but we can stay or go down, so we might not visit all if we go down, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, and we can only change by 1 each step, the path must go through all integers from min to max, but here since we start low and end high, we will go through all y from 0 to 9, but we might go down temporarily, so we might visit some y multiple times.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably go up directly unless blocked.\n\nNow, let's see the constraints.\n\nFirst, at t=0: y_0=0, safe.\n\nWe can choose a_0: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_1=1; if D, y_1=0? but y=0, D would go to -1, but y must be in [0,9], so at y=0, D is invalid? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=-1, not in [0,9], so not allowed. Similarly, at y=9, U not allowed.\n\nSo at boundaries, only S or move away.\n\nAt y=0, possible actions: U (to y=1) or S (stay y=0), D not possible.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, D or S, U not possible.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, freeway 1 (y=1) is occupied only at t=0. Since at t=0, we are not on y=1, it is safe to be on y=1 at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 occupied at t=1 only.\n\ny=2 occupied at t=3 only.\n\ny=6,7,8 occupied at t=11,12,13.\n\ny=3 and 4 occupied at t=15-18.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is by going up as fast as possible, but we need to avoid the occupied times.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, we can go to y=1 or stay.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=1? At t=0, we choose action for next position.\n\nAt t=0, position y_0=0.\n\nChoose a_0: if U, then y_1=1\n\nIf S, y_1=0\n\nNow, at time t, position y_t.\n\nFor collision at t, depends on y_t.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=1, that is, y_1=1.\n\nAt time t=1, y_t=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied only at t=0, not at t=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=2 at t=2, etc.\n\nBut y=5 is occupied at t=1.\n\ny=5 at t=1 is dangerous.\n\nNow, let's see a direct up path.\n\nSuppose we always go up when possible.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\na_0: U, so y_1=1\n\nAt t=1, y_1=1, which is k=1, occupied? k=1 occupied only at t=0, not t=1, so safe.\n\nThen a_1: U, y_2=2\n\nAt t=2, y_2=2, k=2.\n\nk=2 occupied at t=3 only, not at t=2, so safe.\n\nThen a_2: U, y_3=3\n\nAt t=3, y_3=3, k=3.\n\nk=3 occupied at t=15-18, not at t=3, so safe.\n\nThen a_3: U, y_4=4\n\nAt t=4, y_4=4, k=4, not occupied at t=4 (occ at 15-18), safe.\n\na_4: U, y_5=5\n\nAt t=5, y_5=5, k=5.\n\nk=5 occupied at t=1 only, not at t=5, so safe.\n\nBut at t=5, y=5, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen a_5: U, y_6=6\n\nAt t=6, y_6=6, k=6.\n\nk=6 occupied at t=11,12,13, not at t=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_6: U, y_7=7 at t=7, k=7 not occ at t=7.\n\na_7: U, y_8=8 at t=8, k=8 not occ at t=8.\n\na_8: U, y_9=9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9, safe.\n\nTotal turns: from t=0 to t=9, that's 10 positions: y_0 to y_9, so H=10 turns? Let's see the time.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=1\n\n...\n\nt=9: y=9\n\nSo after 9 actions, from t=0 to t=9, that's 10 turns? t is the time index.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H steps, we have y_H.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H.\n\nWe want y_H=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn the sequence above, with always U, we have y_t = t for t from 0 to 9, y_9=9.\n\nNow check for each t, if y_t in [1,8], not occupied at that t.\n\ny_t = t, so for k=y_t:\n\nt=1, k=1, occ only at t=0, not t=1, safe\n\nt=2, k=2, occ at t=3, not t=2, safe\n\nt=3, k=3, occ at t=15-18, not t=3, safe\n\nt=4, k=4, same, safe\n\nt=5, k=5, occ at t=1, not t=5, safe\n\nt=6, k=6, occ at t=11-13, not t=6, safe\n\nt=7, k=7, same, safe\n\nt=8, k=8, same, safe\n\nt=9, y=9, safe.\n\nNo problem, and H=9, since y_9=9 at t=9.\n\nt from 0 to 9, that's 10 time points, but H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the time.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=2.\n\nAt turn T=2, which is t=0 in offset, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at turn T=3, which is t=1, y_1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T=2 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 at turn 2+H.\n\nMinimal H such that we reach y=9 in H steps.\n\nIn the sequence: start turn 2, y=0\n\nAction a_2: U, to turn 3, y=1\n\na_3: U, turn 4, y=2\n\na_4: U, turn 5, y=3\n\na_5: U, turn 6, y=4\n\na_6: U, turn 7, y=5\n\na_7: U, turn 8, y=6\n\na_8: U, turn 9, y=7\n\na_9: U, turn 10, y=8\n\na_10: U, turn 11, y=9\n\nSo at turn 11, y=9, with H=9 actions? From turn 2 to turn 11, that's 10 turns, but actions from a_2 to a_10, that's 9 actions.\n\nTurns: at turn T, we perform action a_T, then move to turn T+1.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 2, we do action, go to turn 3 with new position.\n\nAfter action at turn 2, position at turn 3 is set.\n\nWe want position at some turn to be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, after 9 actions, at turn 2+9=11, position is (0,9).\n\nH=9.\n\nIn terms of t offset: from t=0 to t=9, 10 steps? t=0 to t=9 is 10 time points, but actions between them.\n\nI think H is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 or something.\n\nFrom the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=2, at turn 2 + H - 1 = 2+H-1, we have y=9.\n\nWith the path above, at turn 11, y=9, so 2+H-1=11, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\n2 + H - 1 = 11, so H - 1 = 9, H=10.\n\nActions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for t=0 to 9, actions at turns 2 to 11? a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nWhen t=0, a_{t_1}, action at turn t_1.\n\nAfter action at turn t_1, we go to turn t_1+1, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nThe position is reached at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nFor example, if no move, H=1, action at t_1, but position at t_1 is initial, not changed.\n\nAfter actions, position at turn t_1 + H is after H actions.\n\nBut the turn when we reach: after performing H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nPerhaps inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so actions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1\n\nThen after these actions, at the next turn, which is turn (t_1 + H - 1) + 1 = t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at some turn, say T.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nt_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, suppose H=1, one action: action at t_1, then after action, at turn t_1 + 1, position changed. But we reach at turn t_1 + 1, which is t_1 + H -1 only if H=2? Confusion.\n\nAssume we start at turn t_1 with position.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, position initial.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1 + 1, new position.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want position at turn T to be (0,9), with T as small as possible.\n\nT = t_1 + k for some k.\n\nThen H is the number of actions to reach, so k = H, T = t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t_1 + H - 1\", so perhaps they define H differently.\n\nPerhaps the sequence includes H actions, and we reach after H actions at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nt_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, H=0, but we are at (0,0) not (0,9).\n\nMinimal H to reach.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn my path, to reach y=9 from y=0, we need at least 9 up moves, so minimal H=9 actions if we go directly.\n\nIn my sequence, with 9 up moves, we reach at turn 11, which is t_1 + 9 since t_1=2, 2+9=11.\n\nNow, turn t_1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 11, so 2+H-1=11, H=10.\n\nBut with 9 actions, we reach at turn 11.\n\nIf H=10, t_1 + H -1 = 2+10-1=11, yes.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=9, so 10 actions? t from 0 to 9, that's 10 actions.\n\nBut we only have 9 up moves in the sequence.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nTurn 2: position y=0\n\nAction a_2: U, then turn 3: y=1\n\nAction a_3: U, turn 4: y=2\n\n...\nup to\nAction a_10: U, turn 11: y=9\n\nSo actions at turn 2 to 10, that's 9 actions: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 → 9 actions.\n\nH=9, actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 8} since H-1=8.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nIf H=9, t from 0 to 8, actions at t_1 +0 to t_1+8, turns 2 to 10.\n\nThen at turn (t_1 + H -1) = 2+9-1=10, position is? After action at turn 10, position at turn 11 is y=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, when we perform action, position is still y=8, I think.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position, then we choose action a_T, which determines position at turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, position is fixed, we choose a_T for next.\n\nWe want at some turn T, position to be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nTurn 11 = t_1 + 9.\n\nThe problem says \"reach at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nSet t_1 + H -1 = 11, t_1=2, so 2 + H -1 =11, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut with H=10, we reach at turn 2+10-1=11, same.\n\nBut actions: for H=10, actions from t=0 to 9, at turns 2 to 11.\n\nBut at turn 11, we do action, but after that position at turn 12.\n\nI think there's a mismatch.\n\nPerhaps the position is reached before the action or after.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in the sequence I have, with 9 up actions, we reach at turn 11.\n\nAnd in the path, it seems no collision, as I checked earlier.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=1 for y=5? No, in the path, at t=5, y=5, which is not occupied.\n\nt in offset.\n\nIn my path: at time t=0, y=0\n\nt=1, y=1\n\nt=2, y=2\n\nt=3, y=3\n\nt=4, y=4\n\nt=5, y=5\n\nt=6, y=6\n\nt=7, y=7\n\nt=8, y=8\n\nt=9, y=9\n\nAll safe as per occupation.\n\nFor example, at t=1, y=1, k=1, occupied only at t=0, not t=1.\n\nAt t=5, y=5, k=5, occupied only at t=1, not t=5.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, k=6, occupied t=11,12,13, not t=6.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo this path works in H=9 actions? But let's confirm H.\n\nAccording to the problem, with this, we reach at turn 2+9=11, and t_1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 =11, so H-1=9, H=10? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11, t_1=2, so 2 + H -1 =11, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut with 9 actions, we reach at turn 11 after 9 actions.\n\nNumber of actions is 9.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns including start or something.\n\nI think it's messy, but in the answer, we can list the actions.\n\nIn this case, we can reach in 9 moves with all U.\n\nBut is there a constraint I missed?\n\nFreeway 2 is occupied at t=3, but in the path, at t=3, y=3, which is k=3, not occupied at t=3.\n\nk=2 is occupied at t=3, but at t=3, we are on y=3, not y=2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we start at y=0, t=0.\n\nAt t=0, if we were on y=1, it would be occupied, but we are not.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 5, at t=1, occupied, but we are on y=1 at t=1, not y=5.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nWith this, we can reach y=9 at t=9 (offset), turn 11.\n\nMinimal H should be 9, but let's see if we can do better.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, with max +1 per turn, minimum 9 moves, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nCan we do in less? No, because we need to increase y by 9, each action can increase by at most 1, so at least 9 actions.\n\nThus H=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions all U.\n\nBut we need to write for each turn.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 2: U  (to y=1 at turn 3)\n\nTurn 3: U  (to y=2 at turn 4)\n\nTurn 4: U  (to y=3 at turn 5)\n\nTurn 5: U  (to y=4 at turn 6)\n\nTurn 6: U  (to y=5 at turn 7)\n\nTurn 7: U  (to y=6 at turn 8)\n\nTurn 8: U  (to y=7 at turn 9)\n\nTurn 9: U  (to y=8 at turn 10)\n\nTurn 10: U  (to y=9 at turn 11)\n\nAfter action at turn 10, position at turn 11 is (0,9).\n\nNow, reach at turn 11, which is t_1 + H -1? t_1=2, H=9? 2+9-1=10, but turn 11 is 10? 2+9=11.\n\nt_1 + H -1 for H=9: 2+9-1=10, but we reach at turn 11, not 10.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps H includes the starting turn.\n\nI think for the purpose, we can output the sequence.\n\nBut let's follow the problem.\n\nSuppose we reach at turn T.\n\nT min is 11, as above.\n\nNow, with H actions, T = t_1 + H.\n\nBecause after 0 actions, at t_1; after 1 action, at t_1+1, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at t_1 + H.\n\nSet to 11, so t_1 + H =11, H=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo for H=9, t_1 + H -1 =2+9-1=10, but we reach at 11, not 10.\n\nSo perhaps the definition is different.\n\nMaybe \"turns H\" means the number of turns from start to reach, including start or not.\n\nTo resolve, in the answer format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc, and we list until the action before reaching.\n\nIn this case, to reach at turn 11, we perform actions from turn 2 to turn 10.\n\nSo 9 actions.\n\nFor H=9, actions from t=0 to 8, turns t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +8, which is turn 10, position is not yet 9, it is 8.\n\nThen after action at turn 10, we go to turn 11 with y=9.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is not 9.\n\nThe problem says \"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\", so at that turn, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn 10, position is (0,8), not 9.\n\nSo we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we are at (0,9) at turn 10, then t_1 + H -1 =10, t_1=2, so 2 + H -1 =10, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThen at turn 10, position (0,9).\n\nHow to achieve that?\n\nStart at turn 2, y=0.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nSo from turn 2 to turn 10, that's 8 steps? Turns: at turn 2, position; after actions, at turn 3,4,...,10.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 10, the position changes over 8 actions? Let's see:\n\nAt turn 2: y=0 (before any action)\n\nAfter action at turn 2, position at turn 3.\n\nAfter action at turn 3, position at turn 4.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 9, position at turn 10.\n\nTo have position at turn 10 be y=9.\n\nThat means from turn 2 to turn 10, we have 8 actions: at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter these 8 actions, position at turn 10 is y=9.\n\nBut we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 8 steps, each step delta y = -1,0,1, so minimum 9 steps to increase by 9, impossible in 8 steps.\n\nMax increase per step is +1, from 0 to 9, delta +9, so at least 9 steps.\n\nThus, cannot reach before turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, with 9 actions as before.\n\nIn the problem, for H, if we set reach at turn 11, then t_1 + H -1 =11, 2 + H -1=11, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen with H=10, actions from t=0 to 9, at turns 2 to 11.\n\nAt turn 11, we perform action, but position at turn 11 is before action, or after?\n\nI think it's better to output the sequence as per the path.\n\nIn the sequence I have, it works, and we can list the actions.\n\nBut in the occupation, is there any issue?\n\nAnother thing: at t=11, y=9, but freeways 6,7,8 are occupied at t=11, but y=9 not on freeway, so safe.\n\nIn the path, at t=11, we are not on freeway.\n\nt=11 offset, but in my path, at t=9, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=9, y=9.\n\nt=9, freeway 6,7,8 occupied at t=11,12,13? t=11 is later.\n\nIn offset t, at t=9, y=9, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at t=11.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 occupied at t=11, but if we are on y=6 at t=11, it would be collision, but in our path, at t=11, we are at y=9 if we reached earlier, but in the min path, at t=9 we are at y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? No, min 9 steps.\n\nBut in the car state, there is freeway 2 occupied at t=3, but we are not on it.\n\nBut what about at t=1, freeway 5 occupied.\n\nIn our path, at t=1, we are at y=1, not y=5.\n\nBut suppose we start and stay at y=0 for some time, then go up, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nOr go down, but y=0 is min, cannot go down.\n\nSo direct up is fastest.\n\nBut is there a time when we must avoid?\n\nFor example, at t=3, freeway 2 is occupied, so if we are on y=2 at t=3, collision.\n\nIn our path, at t=3, we are at y=3, not y=2.\n\nBut if we were slower, we might be on y=2 at t=3.\n\nBut in fast path, we are not.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, if we were on y=5, collision, but we are on y=1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 actions.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 2: U (move to y=1 at turn 3)\n\nAt turn 3: U (to y=2 at turn 4)\n\nAt turn 4: U (to y=3 at turn 5)\n\nAt turn 5: U (to y=4 at turn 6)\n\nAt turn 6: U (to y=5 at turn 7)\n\nAt turn 7: U (to y=6 at turn 8)\n\nAt turn 8: U (to y=7 at turn 9)\n\nAt turn 9: U (to y=8 at turn 10)\n\nAt turn 10: U (to y=9 at turn 11)\n\nAnd we reach at turn 11.\n\nIn the answer, for H=9, but according to the problem, reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =2+9-1=10, but at turn 10 position is y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at turn 10 be y=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nThat means from turn 2 to turn 10, we need to increase y by 9 in 8 steps, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest possible is turn 11 with y=9.\n\nTherefore, for the output, we list actions from turn 2 to turn 10, all U.\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\", so for turn 10, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps accept that.\n\nMaybe the position is considered after the action immediately, but the turn is when the action is taken.\n\nI think for practical purposes, we can proceed.\n\nSo the sequence is all U for 9 actions.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut in the box, it should be the actions.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns from t_1 to reach, so from turn 2 to turn 11, 10 turns, but actions are 9.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the car state, for freeway 2, there are two cars, but only one is relevant.\n\nBut in the path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps at some point, if we delay, we might get stuck later, but in this case, no need.\n\nFor example, at t=11,12,13, freeways 6,7,8 are occupied, so we cannot be on them at those times.\n\nBut in our path, we pass y=6 at t=6, y=7 at t=7, y=8 at t=8, all before t=11, so safe.\n\nIf we were slower, we might have problem, but we are fast.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and 4 occupied at t=15-18, but we pass at t=3 and 4, early.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,0), and we start moving up.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 2, position (0,0), we do U, go to (0,1) at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, on y=1, freeway 1, which is occupied only at t=0 (turn 2), not at t=1 (turn 3), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,1) at turn t_1 = 3 to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe collision rule is important: I collide at turn T only if I'm on a freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide an action that changes my position for turn T+1.\n\nLet me read that note carefully: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T. When I take action a_T, it determines y_{T+1}. But for collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check cars on freeway y_T at time T. Similarly, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I check cars on freeway y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe key point is that when I move, I'm not on the intermediate rows during the move; I'm only on one row per turn.\n\nNow, the car movements: for each car, given at initial turn t_1=3, with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nI need to find where the cars are at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars by freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car, (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction is right, and it's moving right, so at time T, position = [tail + s(T-t_1), head + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nBut head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be larger than tail? Here head=48, tail=1, so yes, head > tail.\n\nAt time t_1=3, span is [τ, h] = [1,48] for right-moving? The notation says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so here τ=1, h=48, so [1,48].\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [1 + 48(T-3), 48 + 48(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\n0 is the x-position, I think, since we're at (0, y), so x=0.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, moving vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, so when we say collision, it's when the player is at (0,y) and a car on row y has x=0 within its span at that turn.\n\nNow, for freeway 1, y=1, car: at T, span [1 + 48(T-3), 48 + 48(T-3)]\n\nSince speed=48, and T increases, this car is moving right, so span is shifting right.\n\nFor x=0 to be in [1 + 48(T-3), 48 + 48(T-3)]\n\nSince 1 + 48(T-3) <= 48 + 48(T-3), and both increase with T.\n\nx=0 in span if 1 + 48(T-3) <= 0 <= 48 + 48(T-3)\n\nBut 1 + 48(T-3) >=1 for T>=3, since T-3>=0, so 1 + 48(T-3) >=1 >0, so lower bound >0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in span for any T, because the car starts at x=1 to 48 at T=3, and moves right, so x=0 is always left of it, never covered.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound 48 + 48(T-3) >=48, so always positive, but lower bound min is 1 at T=3, increasing, so 0 never in [low, high] since low >=1.\n\nSo for freeway 1, no collision possible at any time, because car never covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2, y=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 12)  head=-24, tail=-35? For right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor this car: head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nSince right-moving, at t_1=3, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-35 + 12(T-3), -24 + 12(T-3)]\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (24, 13, right, 12) head=24, tail=13, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 + 12(T-3), 24 + 12(T-3)]\n\nNow, for x=0 to be in span for first car: -35 + 12(T-3) <= 0 <= -24 + 12(T-3)\n\nSimilarly for second car: 13 + 12(T-3) <= 0 <= 24 + 12(T-3)\n\nBut second car: 13 + 12(T-3) >=13 >0 for T>=3, so lower bound >0, so 0 not in span, since min x is 13 at T=3, increasing.\n\nFirst car: -35 + 12(T-3) <= 0 <= -24 + 12(T-3)\n\nSet k = T-3, k>=0 integer.\n\nSo -35 + 12k <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 12k\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12k <= 0 => 12k <= 35 => k <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so k<=2 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 + 12k => 24 <= 12k => k >= 2.\n\nSo for k=2, both: k>=2 and k<=2, so k=2.\n\nAt k=2, T-3=2, T=5.\n\nCheck: at T=5, first car span: [-35 + 12*2, -24 + 12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for k=1, T=4: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nk=3, T=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=5, for freeway 2, the first car covers x=0.\n\nSecond car never covers x=0, as we saw.\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision possible only at T=5.\n\nNow freeway 3, y=3: one car (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nHead=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=3.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T, [ -53 + 3(T-3), -42 + 3(T-3) ]\n\nx=0 in span if -53 + 3k <= 0 <= -42 + 3k, k=T-3\n\n-53 + 3k <= 0 => 3k <= 53 => k <= 53/3 ≈17.666, k<=17\n\n0 <= -42 + 3k => 42 <= 3k => k >= 14\n\nSo k from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nT = k+3, so T=17 to 20.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4, y=4: same as freeway 3? (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nExactly same: head=-42, tail=-53, right, speed=3.\n\nSo same as above, collision when T=17 to 20.\n\nBut freeway 4 is different row, but same car configuration.\n\nNow freeway 5, y=5: one car (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so we need to use left-moving formula.\n\nHead and tail: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], I think.\n\nLook back at update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the text: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nNow, head=-24, tail=11? But for left-moving, if head is the front, and moving left, head should be less than tail or something?\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the head is on the left, so smaller x, tail on right, larger x.\n\nHere head=-24, tail=11, so if moving left, at t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11], so from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nThen moving left, so at time T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [-24 - 36(T-3), 11 - 36(T-3)]\n\nx=0 in span if -24 -36k <= 0 <= 11 -36k, k=T-3\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span decreases.\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36k <= 0 => -36k <= 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36k >= -24, which is always true since k>=0.\n\n-24 -36k <=0 => -36k <=24, divide by -36, reverse, k >= -24/36 = -2/3, but k>=0, so always true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36k => 36k <=11 => k <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so k=0 only.\n\nAt k=0, T=3, span [-24,11], which includes 0? -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nBut at T=3, which is the current turn? We are at turn t_1=3, and we are on y=1, not on y=5, so for collision, we only care when we are on that row.\n\nAt T=3, we are on y=1, not on y=5, so no collision at that time for us.\n\nBut for future, k>=1, T>=4.\n\nFor k=0, T=3, but we are not on y=5.\n\nFor k=1, T=4: 0 <= 11 -36(1) = 11-36= -25? 0 <= -25? False, so not satisfied.\n\nSimilarly for higher k, worse.\n\nSo only possible at k=0, T=3, but since we are not on y=5 then, no collision on freeway 5 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 6,7,8 all have same: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, cars: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nHead=-40, tail=-51, direction=right, speed=4.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-51, -40] for right-moving.\n\nAt T, [ -51 + 4(T-3), -40 + 4(T-3) ]\n\nx=0 in span if -51 + 4k <= 0 <= -40 + 4k, k=T-3\n\n-51 +4k <=0 => 4k <=51 => k <= 51/4=12.75, k<=12\n\n0 <= -40 +4k => 40 <=4k => k >=10\n\nSo k from 10 to 12, T=13 to 15.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7, y=7: same car (-40, -51, right, 4), so collision T=13 to 15.\n\nFreeway 8, y=8: same, collision T=13 to 15.\n\nNow, freeway 9: but the freeways are y=1 to 8, y=9 is the target, no cars, I assume.\n\ny=0 might have cars? But the player starts from (0,1), and we need to reach (0,9), so y=0 and y=9 are boundaries, but cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the problem, \"freeways y=1,...,8\", so no cars on y=0 or y=9.\n\nNow, I am at (0,1) at turn t_1=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, so it might take more than 8 turns.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so after H turns, I reach at turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's see.\n\nSequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but time from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy, and so on, up to after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we reach when y=9.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9? Let's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions over H turns? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}, but we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThe position is defined at each turn: at turn T, we have y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T, take action a_T, then at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =1.\n\nWe take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H}, but we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1 + H - 1} at turn t_1 + H - 1, we set y_{t_1 + H}, but y_{t_1 + H - 1} is already set before that action? I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- At turn T, position is y_T.\n\n- At turn T, we take action a_T, which sets Δy for the move to y_{T+1}.\n\n- So y_{T+1} = y_T + a_T effect.\n\n- Collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nWe need that at the turn when we are at y=9, it is turn t_1 + H - 1, and y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nSo the actions are at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H - 1} at turn t_1 + H - 1, we set y_{t_1 + H}, but we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9, which means at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are already at y=9.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is y_{t_1 + H - 1}, and we need this to be 9.\n\nThe last action that affects this is a_{t_1 + H - 2}, which sets y_{t_1 + H - 1} from y_{t_1 + H - 2}.\n\nLet's think:\n\n- At turn t_1: y_{t_1} =1\n\n- Take a_{t_1}: sets y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\n- At turn t_1 +1: y_{t_1 +1}, take a_{t_1 +1}, sets y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\n- At turn t_1 + H - 1: y_{t_1 + H - 1}, and we need this to be 9.\n\n- Then we take action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that, as long as at turn t_1 + H - 1 we are at 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions includes a_{t_1 + H - 1}, but since we are already at 9 at turn t_1 + H - 1, taking a_{t_1 + H - 1} might move us away, but the position at that turn is 9, so it's fine, and we can choose to stay or whatever, but since we reached, probably we stop or something, but the action is still taken, I think.\n\nIn the context, we just need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and that turn is t_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor minimal H, we need to get to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nNow, from y=1 to y=9, the direct way is 8 moves up, but we have to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous times for each row.\n\nWe need to be on row y at turn T only if it is safe, i.e., no car on that row at that time covering x=0.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- Row 1: no danger, as we saw.\n\n- Row 2: danger only at T=5\n\n- Row 3: danger at T=17,18,19,20\n\n- Row 4: danger at T=17,18,19,20\n\n- Row 5: no danger\n\n- Row 6: danger at T=13,14,15\n\n- Row 7: danger at T=13,14,15\n\n- Row 8: danger at T=13,14,15\n\nRow 5 has no danger, good.\n\nWe start at y=1, T=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 or something and move up.\n\nSince we can move vertically, we can stay on a row or move up/down to avoid being on a dangerous row at dangerous times.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 turns if we go up every time.\n\nBut we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up in 8 turns.\n\nStart at T=3, y=1.\n\nAction at T=3: if we go up, to y=2 at T=4.\n\ny_{T=3} =1, take a_T=U, then y_{T=4} =2\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, if we go up, y_{T=5}=3, and so on.\n\nBut we need to check collision at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and check if row y_T has collision at time T.\n\nFor the path:\n\n- T=3: y=1, row 1, safe, as we saw.\n\n- T=4: y=4? After action at T=3, y_{4} = y_3 + Δy.\n\nIf we go up at T=3, y_4=2\n\nAt T=4, we are on y=2, row 2.\n\nRow 2 is dangerous at T=5? T=4, not T=5.\n\nAt T=4, for row 2, is there collision?\n\nEarlier, for row 2, only dangerous at T=5.\n\nAt T=4, k=T-3=1, first car span: [-35+12(1), -24+12(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not 0.\n\nSo safe at T=4.\n\nNow, at T=4, if we go up, a_{T=4}=U, then y_{T=5}=3\n\nAt T=5, we are on y=3, row 3.\n\nRow 3 is dangerous at T=17-20, not at T=5, so safe.\n\nT=5, k=2, for row 3, car: at T=5, k=2, span [-53 +3(2), -42+3(2)] = [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue up: at T=5, go up, y_{T=6}=4\n\nAt T=6, y=4, row 4, similar to row 3, at T=6, k=3, span [-53+9, -42+9]=[-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen T=6, go up, y_{T=7}=5\n\nAt T=7, y=5, row 5, no danger, safe.\n\nT=7, go up, y_{T=8}=6\n\nAt T=8, y=6, row 6.\n\nRow 6 dangerous at T=13,14,15? T=8, k=T-3=5, for row 6 car: span [-51 +4(5), -40+4(5)] = [-51+20, -40+20] = [-31,-20], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen T=8, go up, y_{T=9}=7\n\nAt T=9, y=7, row 7, similar, at T=9, k=6, span [-51+24, -40+24]=[-27,-16], safe.\n\nT=9, go up, y_{T=10}=8\n\nAt T=10, y=8, row 8, k=7, span [-51+28, -40+28]=[-23,-12], safe.\n\nThen T=10, go up, y_{T=11}=9\n\nAt T=11, y=11? y_{T=11}=9\n\nNow, at turn T=11, we are at y=9, which is the target.\n\nBut we need to check if at T=11, we are on y=9, and it's safe, which it is.\n\nNow, the turn: we started at T=3, y=1.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nAt T=3, action U, to y=2 at T=4? Positions:\n\n- T=3: y=1\n\n- Take a_{3}=U, so y_{4}=2\n\n- T=4: y=2, take a_{4}=U, y_{5}=3\n\n- T=5: y=3, take a_{5}=U, y_{6}=4\n\n- T=6: y=4, take a_{6}=U, y_{7}=5\n\n- T=7: y=5, take a_{7}=U, y_{8}=6\n\n- T=8: y=6, take a_{8}=U, y_{9}=7\n\n- T=9: y=7, take a_{9}=U, y_{10}=8\n\n- T=10: y=8, take a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9\n\nAt T=11: y=11? y_{11}=9\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nt_1=3, so t_1 + H -1 =11, so 3 + H -1 =11, thus 2 + H =11, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=8, so actions at T=3 to T=10, that's 8 actions? t from 0 to H-1, H=9, t=0 to 8.\n\nT relative: t=0: T=t_1=3\n\nt=1: T=4\n\n...\n\nt=8: T=11? Let's index.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=9, t=0 to 8, actions at T=3+0=3 to T=3+8=11.\n\nBut at T=11, we take action a_{11}, which sets y_{12}, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{3+9-1}=y_{11}=9.\n\nAt turn T=11, y_{11} should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=10, y_{10}=8, take a_{10}=U, so y_{11}=9.\n\nThen at T=11, y_{11}=9, which is what we want.\n\nAnd we take action a_{11}, but it doesn't affect y_{11}, it affects y_{12}, but since we are done at T=11, we don't care.\n\nIn the action sequence, we need to specify a_{t} for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which includes a_{11}.\n\nBut at T=11, we are at y=9, we can take any action, say S, to stay, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, for the last action, since we are already at 9, we might take S or whatever.\n\nBut in this case, with 8 up moves, we reach at T=11, y=11=9? T=11, y=9.\n\nT=11.\n\nIn terms of turns: from T=3 to T=11, that's 9 turns? T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: that's 9 positions.\n\nBut number of actions: we take actions at T=3 to T=10 to set positions from T=4 to T=11.\n\nAt T=3: position y=1\n\nAfter a_3: y_4=2\n\nAfter a_4: y_5=3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_10: y_11=9\n\nSo at T=11, we are at y=9.\n\nThe actions are a_3 to a_10, that's 8 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so if H=9, t=0 to 8, actions at T=3 to 10.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{3+9-1}=y_{11}=9, which is set by a_{10}.\n\nNow, in this path, we never encountered a collision because we passed all rows before the dangerous times.\n\nRow 2 danger at T=5, but we were on row 2 at T=4, safe.\n\nRow 3-4 danger at T=17-20, we passed at T=5-6, safe.\n\nRow 6-8 danger at T=13-15, we passed at T=8-10, which is before, safe.\n\nT=8,9,10 for y=6,7,8, and danger at T=13-15, so earlier, no problem.\n\nSo with H=9 turns (actions from T=3 to T=10), we reach at T=11.\n\nBut H=9, since t from 0 to 8, 9 actions? t=0 to H-1, so number of actions is H.\n\nAnd we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1 =11, so H=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We went directly up in 8 moves, but since we start at T=3, and each move increases turn, we need 8 moves to go up 8 steps, from y=1 to y=9.\n\ny from 1 to 9, difference 8, so at least 8 moves up, but since we start at T=3, after 8 moves, we are at T=3+8=11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: to go from y=1 to y=9, we need exactly 8 up moves, no down or stay, so minimum 8 actions, but in terms of turns, we need to be at turn T=11 to have y=9.\n\nWith 8 actions: actions at T=3 to T=10, y_11=9.\n\nIf we could reach earlier, but we start at T=3 y=1, and each action increases turn by one, so we can't reach before T=11 with y=9, since from y=1, min 8 up moves, each taking one turn, so earliest at T=11.\n\nT=3: y=1\n\nAfter 1 move: T=4, y=2\n\nAfter 2: T=5, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 moves: T=11, y=9.\n\nYes, so minimum possible is H=9, reaching at T=11.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible without collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought row 2 has danger at T=5, but in the path, we are on row 2 at T=4, not T=5.\n\nAt T=5, we are on row 3.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for T=3 to T=10, all actions U.\n\nBut at T=10, after action, we are at y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, we also need to specify the action at T=11? No, actions up to t_1 + H -1, which is T=10 for H=9? t_1 + H -1 =3+9-1=11, so actions include a_{11}.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 + t.\n\nt=0: T=3\n\nt=1: T=4\n\n...\n\nt=8: T=11 (since t_1 + t =3+8=11)\n\nH=9, t=0 to 8, T=3 to 11.\n\nAt T=11, we take action a_{11}, but since we are already at y=9, we can take S, for example.\n\nIn the position, at T=11, y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure no collision at T=11, but y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAction at T=11 can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, all actions are U except possibly the last.\n\nBut in this case, we used all U.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nWhat about row 5? We passed at T=7, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times again.\n\nFor example, row 6: dangerous at T=13,14,15.\n\nWe were on row 6 at T=8, which is before, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut row 2 danger at T=5 only, we were at T=4, safe.\n\nBut at T=5, if we were on row 2, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, it seems fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1) at T=3, and we moved up each time.\n\nBut the question is, do we need to specify the sequence?\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=9, actions at T=3 to T=11.\n\nActions: for T=3 to T=10, we need to go up, so U.\n\nAt T=11, we are at y=9, so we can take S, or U or D, but since we are at y=9, if we take U, y=10, but y max 9, so probably y_{12} = min(9, y_{11} +1) or something, but in the update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y=9 and U, y next=10, but clamped to 9? The dynamics say y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so probably it stays at 9.\n\nSimilarly for D at y=0.\n\nBut to be safe, we can take S at the last turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, since we need to be at y=9 at T=11, and we are, action at T=11 can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the action list.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to go faster, but we can't, since min 8 up moves.\n\nUnless we start from y=1, and go to y=9 in 8 moves, but we need 8 actions, from T=3 to T=10, reaching y at T=11.\n\nPerhaps with waiting, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we had to avoid being on some row at certain times, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nBut let me check if at some point we might have collision.\n\nAnother thing: at T=3, we are on y=1, row 1, safe.\n\nBut is there a car on row 1 at T=3? We said no, since span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps for row 5, we thought no danger, but let me confirm.\n\nFreeway 5: car (-24,11,left,36)\n\nAt T=3, span [-24,11], which includes 0, but at T=3, we are on y=1, not y=5, so no collision.\n\nAnd for T>3, no time when 0 is covered, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo with H=9, actions: a_3=U, a_4=U, a_5=U, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, and a_11=S, for example.\n\nBut a_11 is at T=11, which is part of the sequence.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have 9 actions.\n\nBut we reach at T=11.\n\nPerhaps we can have H smaller? But impossible, since min 8 up moves, so min H=9.\n\nH=9 means 9 actions, reaching at turn t_1 + H -1 =3+9-1=11.\n\nIf H=8, then t_1 + H -1=3+8-1=10, so we need to be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=10, we need to have reached by earlier.\n\nFrom T=3 y=1, to T=10 y=9, that means in 7 moves? From T=3 to T=10, positions: at T=3 y=1, after actions, at T=10 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions between: actions at T=3 to T=9? Let's see.\n\nAt T=3: y=1\n\nAfter a_3: y_4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_9: y_10\n\nWe need y_10=9.\n\nSo from y_1=1 to y_10=9, in 7 steps? y_10 is set by actions from a_3 to a_9.\n\nThe changes: from turn T=3 to T=10, there are 7 intervals, so 7 actions to change from y_3=1 to y_10=9.\n\ny_10 - y_3 = sum of Δy from t=3 to 9, 7 terms? Actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 affect y_4 to y_10.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + a_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + a_4 = y_3 + a_3 + a_4\n\n...\n\ny_10 = y_3 + a_3 + a_4 + ... + a_9\n\nSince y_3=1, y_10=9, so a_3 + ... + a_9 = 8.\n\nEach a_t is +1, -1, or 0, so to increase by 8 in 7 actions, net +8 with 7 steps, which requires at least 8 up moves but only 7 actions, impossible because min action to increase by 8 is 8 up moves with no down or stay.\n\nWith 7 actions, max increase is +7, if all U, y_10=1+7=8 <9.\n\nIf we have some down or stay, less.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 by T=10.\n\nSimilarly, only possible at T=11 or later.\n\nThus minimal H is 9.\n\nAnd in this case, with all U, we avoid all collisions.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for T=3 to T=10, U, and for T=11, since we are at y=9, we can take S.\n\nBut the action at T=11 is taken, but it doesn't affect the position at T=11.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision on row 2.\n\nAt T=5, row 2 is dangerous, but in our path, at T=5, we are on y=3, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position and time to verify.\n\nTurn T | y before action | action a_T | y after action (at T+1) | Collision check at T\n\nAt turn T, we have position y_T, then we take action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}, but for collision, at turn T, we check based on y_T and time T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=3: y_3=1, row 1, safe. Take a_3=U, so y_4=2\n\nT=4: y_4=2, row 2, at time T=4. Row 2: at T=4, k=1, cars: first car span [-35+12(1), -24+12(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in. Second car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not 0. Safe. Take a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nT=5: y_5=3, row 3, at time T=5. Row 3 car: k=2, span [-53+6, -42+6]=[-47,-36], 0 not in. Safe. Take a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nT=6: y_6=4, row 4, similar, k=3, span [-53+9, -42+9]=[-44,-33], 0 not in. Safe. Take a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nT=7: y_7=5, row 5, no danger. Safe. Take a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nT=8: y_8=6, row 6, at time T=8. Row 6 car: k=5, span [-51+20, -40+20]=[-31,-20], 0 not in. Safe. Take a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: y_9=7, row 7, k=6, span [-51+24, -40+24]=[-27,-16], safe. Take a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: y_10=8, row 8, k=7, span [-51+28, -40+28]=[-23,-12], safe. Take a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nNow, at T=11: y_11=9, row 9, no cars, safe. We need to take action a_11 as part of sequence.\n\nSince y=9, we can take S, so a_11=S.\n\nThen y_12=9.\n\nBut we don't care.\n\nSo the actions are: for T=3 to T=10: U, and T=11: S.\n\nIn the sequence, since H=9, actions at T=3 to T=11.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_3 = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{4} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 8: a_{11} = S\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 8? H=9, t from 0 to 8, so Turn t_1 + t for t=0 to 8.\n\nt=0: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nt=1: Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nt=8: Turn t_1 + 8: a_{t_1 +8}\n\nt_1=3, so Turn 3: a_3\n\nTurn 4: a_4\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: a_11\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions: Turn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nIn the sequence, from Turn 3 to Turn 10, all U except Turn 11 S.\n\nBut Turn 10: a_10=U, which sets y_11=9.\n\nThen Turn 11: a_11=S, which is fine.\n\nWe could take U at Turn 11, but y=9, U would try to go to 10, but since bounded, y_12=9, same as S.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the problem, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nWe have H=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9 but different sequence? But this works.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if at some point we must wait.\n\nFor example, suppose we wanted to go slower, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at T=5, row 2 is dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nBut suppose for some reason we were on row 2 at T=5, we would collide, but we avoided.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for row 6-8, if we were later, but we are earlier.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we stayed longer on some row.\n\nFor example, if we stayed on row 5 at T=7, then we might be on row 6 later, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nBut since we can go directly, and min time, we should.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has two cars, but we only care about when x=0 covered.\n\nAt T=5, only the first car covers x=0.\n\nIn our path, no problem.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\n}\n\nIn the box, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSince t_1=3, and turns are absolute.\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut Turn 11 is t_1 + 8, since t_1=3, 3+8=11.\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nTo write it neatly.\n\nPerhaps we don't need the last action, but since H=9, we include it.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at the turn when we are already at target, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I believe this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 3 to turn 10, resulting in reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. At turn 11, the action is stay (S) since the target is already reached, and any action would be valid but S is chosen for clarity.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- At turn 3, the player is on \\(y = 1\\), which is safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any time).\n- At turn 4, the player is on \\(y = 2\\), which is safe (row 2 is only dangerous at turn 5, not turn 4).\n- At turn 5, the player is on \\(y = 3\\), which is safe (row 3 is dangerous at turns 17–20, not turn 5).\n- At turn 6, the player is on \\(y = 4\\), which is safe (row 4 is dangerous at turns 17–20, not turn 6).\n- At turn 7, the player is on \\(y = 5\\), which has no danger at any time.\n- At turn 8, the player is on \\(y = 6\\), which is safe (row 6 is dangerous at turns 13–15, not turn 8).\n- At turn 9, the player is on \\(y = 7\\), which is safe (row 7 is dangerous at turns 13–15, not turn 9).\n- At turn 10, the player is on \\(y = 8\\), which is safe (row 8 is dangerous at turns 13–15, not turn 10).\n- At turn 11, the player is on \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is safe.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with given positions, directions, and speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars will be at each turn relative to x=0. Since the player is always at x=0, I only care about when the car spans include x=0.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving cars, span moves left, so h and tau decrease by s per turn. For right-moving, span moves right, so h and tau increase by s per turn.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 4.\n\nFor a future turn T, the number of turns from now is Δt = T - t_1 = T - 4.\n\nFor each car, I can compute the span at turn T.\n\nThen, for a given freeway k and turn T, if there is any car on k such that 0 is in [min, max] of the span at T.\n\nBut for collision, it only matters when I'm on that freeway at that turn.\n\nI move by changing y with actions U, D, S.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action.\n\nI start at y=2 at turn 4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y only changes by -1, 0, +1, and I'm at 2, going to 9, I need at least 7 upward moves, but I can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 7 if I take detours, but to minimize H, I should go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nThe minimal H might not be 7 if I have to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1=4.\n\nFreeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, head is h=96, tail tau=49? The span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [tau, h], so tau is left end, h is right end.\n\nI need to be careful with the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] and it moves left, so at T, [h - sΔt, tau - sΔt]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] and it moves right, so at T, [tau + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI think head and tail might be inconsistent.\n\nLook at freeway 2: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFor the first car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSince direction right, Span(t1) should be [tau, h] = [-23, -12]? But -23 is less than -12, so [tau, h] with tau < h for right-moving?\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, [tau, h] with tau left, h right, so tau < h typically.\n\nHere for (-12, -23, right, 12), if tail is -23 and head is -12, but -23 < -12, so tau = -23, h = -12, so span is [-23, -12] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, second car (36, 25, right, 12), but 25 and 36, if tail is 25, head is 36, so span [25,36].\n\nBut direction right, so yes.\n\nIn the first one, tail -23, head -12, so min is -23, max is -12.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be head and tail with head left or something.\n\nBut in freeway 5: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, tau], and h should be left, tau right, so h < tau.\n\nHere h=-60, tau=-25, -60 < -25, so span [-60, -25] at t1.\n\nYes.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at time t, the span is [left_end, right_end] where left_end <= right_end.\n\nFor right-moving car: at t1, left_end = tau, right_end = h, with tau <= h.\n\nAt T, left_end = tau + s*(T-t1), right_end = h + s*(T-t1)\n\nFor left-moving: at t1, left_end = h, right_end = tau, with h <= tau.\n\nAt T, left_end = h - s*(T-t1), right_end = tau - s*(T-t1)\n\nThen, 0 is covered if left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each future turn, I need to know if 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all.\n\nNow, freeways:\n\nk=1: one car (96,49,right,48)\n\nAt t1=4, span: since right, tau=49, h=96? (head,tail) given, so head=96, tail=49.\n\nDirection right, so left_end = tail = 49, right_end = head = 96? No.\n\nAccording to above: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [tau, h], so tau is left, h is right.\n\nIn (96,49,right,48), it says head=96, tail=49, so I think head is the front, tail is rear.\n\nFor right-moving, front is right, so head is right end, tail is left end.\n\nSo Span(t1) = [tail, head] = [49, 96]? But 49 to 96, but direction right.\n\nIn the car state, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right dir, head is the right end, tail is left end.\n\nSimilarly for left dir, head is left end, tail is right end.\n\nIn freeway 5: (-60,-25,left,36), left dir, head=-60, tail=-25, so head is left, tail is right, span [h,tau] = [-60,-25].\n\nYes.\n\nSo back to freeway 1: k=1, car: head=96, tail=49, dir=right, speed=48.\n\nAt t1=4, left_end = tail = 49, right_end = head = 96, so span [49,96]\n\nAt turn T, since right-moving, left_end_T = tail + s*(T-4) = 49 + 48*(T-4)\n\nright_end_T = head + s*(T-4) = 96 + 48*(T-4)\n\n0 covered if left_end_T <= 0 <= right_end_T, i.e., 49 + 48*(T-4) <= 0 <= 96 + 48*(T-4)\n\nSince 49>0 and 96>0, and increasing, 0 <= right_end_T always true since min is 96>0, and left_end_T min 49>0, so left_end_T >=49 >0, so 0 < left_end_T <=0 impossible? left_end_T =49 +48*(T-4) >=49>0, so 0 < 49 <= something, so 0 is always less than left_end_T, so never covered for k=1.\n\nSimilarly, right_end_T >96>0, so 0 is never in [49+48dt, 96+48dt] for dt>=0.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe, no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12) head=-12, tail=-23, dir=right.\n\nSo tail is left end, head is right end? tail=-23, head=-12, so left_end = tail = -23, right_end = head = -12.\n\nSince -23 < -12, span [-23,-12] at t1=4.\n\nAt T, left_end_T = tail + s*(T-4) = -23 + 12*(T-4)\n\nright_end_T = head + s*(T-4) = -12 + 12*(T-4)\n\n0 covered if -23 +12dt <= 0 <= -12 +12dt, where dt=T-4.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25, dir=right.\n\nAt t1, left_end=tail=25, right_end=head=36, span [25,36]\n\nAt T, left_end_T =25 +12dt, right_end_T=36+12dt\n\n0 covered if 25+12dt <=0 <=36+12dt\n\nBut 25+12dt >=25>0, so 0 <= left_end_T impossible, so never covered.\n\nNow for first car: 0 covered if -23 +12dt <= 0 <= -12 +12dt\n\nSet L = -23 +12dt <=0\n\nR = -12 +12dt >=0\n\nL <=0: -23 +12dt <=0 => 12dt <=23 => dt <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so dt <=1 since integer? Turns are discrete, T integer, dt integer.\n\ndt = T-4, integer.\n\nSo L <=0: -23 +12dt <=0 => 12dt <=23 => dt <= floor(23/12)=1 since 12*1=12<23, 12*2=24>23, so dt <=1\n\nR >=0: -12 +12dt >=0 => 12dt >=12 => dt >=1\n\nSo for dt=1, both: L= -23+12= -11 <=0, R= -12+12=0 >=0, so 0 <= R=0, so 0 is covered.\n\nFor dt=0, T=4, L=-23 <=0, R=-12<0? R=-12 +12*0= -12 <0, so R<0, so 0 > R, not <= R, so not covered.\n\n0 covered only if L <=0 and R>=0.\n\nAt dt=0: L=-23 <=0, R=-12 <0, so R<0, thus 0 not <= R, so not covered.\n\nAt dt=1: L=-23+12= -11 <=0, R=-12+12=0 >=0, so 0 <=0, covered.\n\nAt dt=2: L=-23+24=1 >0, so L>0, not <=0, so not covered.\n\nSo only at dt=1, T=5, covered.\n\nNow second car never, as we saw.\n\nSo for freeway 2, at T=5, 0 is covered by the first car.\n\nAt other times, not covered.\n\nT=5, dt=1.\n\nNow freeway 3: (-39,-50,right,3) head=-39, tail=-50, dir=right.\n\ntail=-50, head=-39, so left_end=tail=-50, right_end=head=-39.\n\nAt t1=4, span [-50,-39]\n\nAt T, left_end_T = -50 + 3*(T-4)\n\nright_end_T = -39 + 3*(T-4)\n\n0 covered if -50 +3dt <=0 <= -39 +3dt\n\nL <=0: -50+3dt <=0 => 3dt <=50 => dt <= 50/3 ≈16.666, dt<=16\n\nR >=0: -39+3dt >=0 => 3dt >=39 => dt >=13\n\nSo for dt from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nT=4+13=17 to T=4+16=20.\n\ndt=13: L=-50+39= -11 <=0, R=-39+39=0 >=0, covered\n\ndt=14: L=-50+42= -8 <=0, R=-39+42=3 >=0\n\ndt=15: L=-50+45= -5 <=0, R=-39+45=6 >=0\n\ndt=16: L=-50+48= -2 <=0, R=-39+48=9 >=0\n\ndt=17: L=-50+51=1>0, not <=0\n\nSo covered at T=17,18,19,20.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-39,-50,right,3) same as freeway 3? Head=-39, tail=-50, right, speed=3.\n\nExactly the same, so covered at same times T=17,18,19,20.\n\nNow freeway 5: (-60,-25,left,36) head=-60, tail=-25, dir=left.\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, left_end = head = -60, right_end = tail = -25\n\nSpan [-60,-25]\n\nAt T, since left-moving, left_end_T = head - s*(T-4) = -60 - 36*(T-4)\n\nright_end_T = tail - s*(T-4) = -25 - 36*(T-4)\n\n0 covered if left_end_T <= 0 <= right_end_T\n\nL = -60 -36dt <=0? Always true since negative.\n\nR = -25 -36dt >=0?\n\nR >=0: -25 -36dt >=0 => -36dt >=25 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality, 36dt <= -25, but dt >=0, 36dt >=0 > -25, so 36dt <= -25 impossible.\n\nThus R = -25 -36dt <= -25 <0, so always negative, so 0 > R, not <= R, so never covered.\n\nSimilarly, L always <=0, but R<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo freeway 5 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-36,-47,right,4) head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right.\n\ntail=-47, head=-36, so left_end=tail=-47, right_end=head=-36.\n\nAt T, left_end_T = -47 + 4*(T-4)\n\nright_end_T = -36 + 4*(T-4)\n\n0 covered if -47 +4dt <=0 <= -36 +4dt\n\nL <=0: -47+4dt <=0 => 4dt <=47 => dt <= 47/4=11.75, dt<=11\n\nR >=0: -36+4dt >=0 => 4dt >=36 => dt >=9\n\nSo dt from 9 to 11 inclusive.\n\nT=4+9=13 to T=4+11=15.\n\ndt=9: L=-47+36= -11 <=0, R=-36+36=0 >=0, covered\n\ndt=10: L=-47+40= -7 <=0, R=-36+40=4 >=0\n\ndt=11: L=-47+44= -3 <=0, R=-36+44=8 >=0\n\ndt=12: L=-47+48=1>0, not\n\nSo covered at T=13,14,15.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6? (-36,-47,right,4) identical, so covered at T=13,14,15.\n\nFreeway 8: same, covered at T=13,14,15.\n\nNow freeway 1 always safe, freeway 5 always safe.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 5 is y=5.\n\ny from 1 to 8.\n\nk=1 to 8.\n\ny=1: safe always\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=5 (from earlier)\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=17,18,19,20\n\ny=4: unsafe at same T=17,18,19,20\n\ny=5: safe always\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\nI start at y=2 at turn 4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is (0, y_T)\n\nCollision if at turn T, y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 is covered by a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf I move to a different y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1)\"\n\nSo at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I check for cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen I take action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T, and I choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on freeway y_T (if y_T between 1 and 8), and if there is a car on y_T covering 0 at T, collision.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and check for that freeway at T+1.\n\nI start at turn t_1=4, y_4=2.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 4 to some turn, until I reach y=9.\n\nMinimize the number of turns H, so the sequence length.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nTurn t_1: action a_{t_1} determines y_{t_1 +1}? No.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on y_t, and check collision for freeway y_t at time t.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, check for that.\n\nI start at turn 4, y_4=2.\n\nAfter H actions, I should be at y_{4 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 4, y_4=2.\n\nAfter first action a_4, at turn 5, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\nGenerally, after t actions from turn 4, I am at turn 4+t, with y_{4+t}.\n\nI reach y=9 when y_{4+H} =9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, from turn 4 to turn 4+H-1, and after H actions, at turn (4+H-1)+1 = 4+H, y_{4+H}=9.\n\nSet T_start = t_1 =4.\n\nAt turn T_start, position y_{T_start}.\n\nActions: a_{T_start}, a_{T_start+1}, ..., a_{T_start + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{T_start}, at turn T_start+1, y_{T_start+1} = y_{T_start} + Δy_{T_start}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{T_start + H -1}, at turn T_start + H, y_{T_start + H} = y_{T_start} + sum of Δy from t=T_start to T_start+H-1.\n\nWe want y_{T_start + H} =9.\n\nSince y_{T_start} =2, we need sum of Δy from t=4 to 4+H-1 to be 7, because 2 + sum =9, so sum=7.\n\nΔy_t is +1, -1, or 0, so net upward movement must be 7.\n\nBut since I can move down or stay, the minimal H is at least 7, but could be more.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nUnsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=5 (turn 5)\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=17,18,19,20\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=17,18,19,20\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=13,14,15\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe always, no cars.\n\nI start at y=2, turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, I am on y=2. Is it safe?\n\nFor y=2, at T=4: from earlier, for freeway 2, at T=4, not covered, since dt=0, R=-12<0, not covered. And no other cars, so safe at T=4.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=5 is always safe, I might want to get to y=5 quickly and stay there, but I need to go to 9, so I have to go through 6,7,8 which are unsafe at times.\n\ny=6,7,8 unsafe at T=13,14,15.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4 unsafe at T=17-20.\n\nBut T=17 is later, so if I can reach before T=13, or after T=15, for y=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4, avoid T=17-20.\n\nBut since I start at turn 4, and need to go up, I can probably reach early.\n\nMinimal time: if I go up every turn, from y=2 at T=4.\n\nAfter 0 turns: T=4, y=2\n\na_4=U: T=5, y=3\n\na_5=U: T=6, y=4\n\na_6=U: T=7, y=5\n\na_7=U: T=8, y=6\n\na_8=U: T=9, y=7\n\na_9=U: T=10, y=8\n\na_10=U: T=11, y=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9, with 7 actions: turns 4 to 10.\n\nNow check for collision.\n\nAt each turn, when on freeway, check if unsafe.\n\nTurn T=4, y=2: safe, as above.\n\nT=5, y=3: y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt T=5, for y=3, unsafe only at T=17-20, T=5 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=6, y=4: unsafe at T=17-20, not 6, safe.\n\nT=7, y=5: always safe.\n\nT=8, y=6: unsafe at T=13,14,15. T=8 not in, safe.\n\nT=9, y=7: unsafe at T=13,14,15. T=9 not in, safe.\n\nT=10, y=8: unsafe at T=13,14,15. T=10 not in, safe.\n\nThen T=11, y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and I reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut is there a problem? y=2 at T=5 is unsafe, but in this path, at T=5, I am on y=3, not y=2.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, which is safe.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at T=5, but when I am on y=2 at T=5, which I am not in this sequence.\n\nIn this sequence, I move from y=2 to y=3 at turn 5, so at turn 5, I am on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\ny=2 unsafe at T=5 only.\n\nIn sequence: at T=4, y=2, safe.\n\nAction U, so at T=5, y=3.\n\nAt T=5, on y=3, which is safe at T=5.\n\nThen to y=4 at T=6, safe, and so on.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=13,14,15, but I am at y=6 at T=8, which is before 13, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo with H=7, I can reach by T=11.\n\nBut is there a way with less? H=7 is minimal since net +7 needed, and I go up each time, so no, H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from turn 4 to turn 10, that's 7 actions, reach at turn 11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list actions starting from turn t_1=4.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision at y=2.\n\nAt turn 4, I am on y=2, and it is safe.\n\nThen I take action U, so I move to y=3 at turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I am on y=3, not y=2.\n\ny=2 at turn 5 is unsafe, but I am not on it, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2, at T=5, it is unsafe, but since I am not on freeway 2 at T=5, I am on freeway 3, which is safe.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 7 and 8 are both unsafe at same times, but in my path, I pass through early.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 4 and 3 same, but no issue.\n\nBut let me see if I can go faster? No, 7 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I stay or something, but that would increase H.\n\nSo H=7 should be achievable.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 4 to turn 10 actions.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 4: action? At turn 4, I start at y=2.\n\nI need to choose a_4.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_5=3.\n\nS, y_5=2, but then at T=5, if y=2, it is unsafe, so I should not stay.\n\nD, go down to y=1, but that might delay.\n\nBut with U, I go to y=3.\n\nIn my sequence: a_4=U, to y=3 at T=5\n\na_5=U, to y=4 at T=6\n\na_6=U, to y=5 at T=7\n\na_7=U, to y=6 at T=8\n\na_8=U, to y=7 at T=9\n\na_9=U, to y=8 at T=10\n\na_10=U, to y=9 at T=11\n\nAll safe.\n\nAt T=10, y=8, which is unsafe at T=13-15, but T=10 is before, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is y=8 safe at T=10? Freeway 8 unsafe at T=13,14,15, T=10 not in, and since no other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly without issue.\n\nBut in the beginning, at turn 4, y=2 safe, but if I stay, at T=5 y=2 unsafe, so I must not be on y=2 at T=5.\n\nSo I must move away from y=2 at turn 4.\n\nI can go up to y=3 or down to y=1.\n\nBut going down to y=1 might not help, since I need to go up later.\n\nGoing up is fine.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at T=5, then I have to come back, which takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal is to go up.\n\nNow, but in the sequence above, it seems all good.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6,7,8 at T=13,14,15 unsafe.\n\nBut I am at T=8,9,10 for y=6,7,8, all before.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4 at T=17-20 unsafe, I am at T=5,6, before.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nThus minimal H=7, sequence: U,U,U,U,U,U,U for turns 4 to 10.\n\nBut the actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so turn 4 to turn 10, yes.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut the player position: at turn 4, (0,2), after a_4=U, at turn 5, (0,3), and so on.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 2 has two cars, but I only considered the first one for unsafe at T=5.\n\nSecond car was safe.\n\nAnd for y=2, only at T=5 unsafe.\n\nBut in my sequence, I am not on y=2 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 2 at T=5.\n\nFirst car: at T=5, dt=1, left_end = -23 +12*1 = -11, right_end = -12 +12*1 =0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is included, yes covered.\n\nAnd at T=5, if on y=2, collision.\n\nBut I am not.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps up, so turn 4 to 11, 7 turns later, cannot be earlier.\n\nUnless I start moving before, but I start at turn 4.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=7.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot do this? For example, when I go from y=5 to y=6 at T=8, etc., all safe.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid by waiting, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: at y=5, it is always safe, so I could stay there, but that increases H, not minimal.\n\nSo go directly.\n\nBut let me see the unsafe times again.\n\ny=6 unsafe T=13,14,15\n\nI am at y=6 at T=8, which is before 13.\n\nSimilarly, if I were to be on y=6 at T=13, unsafe, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps from turn 4, I could go down to y=1, but y=1 safe, then at T=5, if I go up to y=2, but at T=5, y=2 unsafe, so I cannot be on y=2 at T=5.\n\nSo if I go to y=1 at T=5, then I can go up later, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 4: D, to y=1 at T=5\n\nThen turn 5: U, to y=2 at T=6? At T=5, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_5=U, to y=2 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=2, which is safe? y=2 unsafe only at T=5, not at other times.\n\nAt T=6, for freeway 2, is it covered?\n\nAt T=6, dt=2, for first car, left_end_T = -23 +12*2 = -23+24=1, right_end= -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [25+24=49,36+24=60], no.\n\nSo y=2 safe at T=6.\n\nThen I can go up, but now I have wasted one turn going down and up, so to reach y=9, it would take more actions.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=5, then U to y=2 at T=6, U to y=3 at T=7, and so on, up to y=9 at T=11? Let's see:\n\nT=4, y=2\n\na4=D, y5=1\n\na5=U, y6=2\n\na6=U, y7=3\n\na7=U, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=U, y10=6\n\na10=U, y11=7\n\na11=U, y12=8\n\na12=U, y13=9\n\nBut at T=13, y=9, safe, but H=9 actions? From turn 4 to 12, 9 actions, reach at turn 13.\n\nWorse than 7.\n\nIf I go directly up, H=7.\n\nSo better.\n\nThus the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut let me see if at any point I might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, when I am at y=8 at T=10, freeway 8.\n\nUnsafe times T=13,14,15.\n\nT=10, for freeway 8, car: (-36,-47,right,4) at T=10, dt=T-4=6\n\nleft_end_T = -47 +4*6 = -47+24= -23\n\nright_end_T = -36 +24= -12\n\nspan [-23,-12], 0 not in, since -23<0 but -12<0? -12<0, so 0 > right_end, not covered. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, y=9, not freeway.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the car on freeway 3, but I am not there at unsafe times.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 are identical, but doesn't affect.\n\nNow, another thing: the player can only be at integer y, and actions change by 1 or 0.\n\nNow, I think H=7 is achievable.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of turns.\n\nStart turn 4, position (0,2)\n\nAfter action a4, turn 5, position y5\n\n...\n\nAfter action a10, turn 11, position y11=9\n\nActions: a4 to a10, that's 7 actions.\n\nSequence: turn 4: U\n\nturn 5: U\n\nturn 6: U\n\nturn 7: U\n\nturn 8: U\n\nturn 9: U\n\nturn 10: U\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut is this minimal H? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path by going down or something, but no, because net movement must be +7.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1 per up.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 10, action U to y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier by starting differently, but no.\n\nFor example, if at turn 4 I go S, stay at y=2, then at turn 5, y=2, which is unsafe, collision, so I cannot.\n\nIf I go D, to y=1 at turn 5, then I have to go up later, more turns.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, this should be the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", which is 7.\n\nAnd the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1=4.\n\nNow, I think I might have missed something with the cars.\n\nFreeway 4 is unsafe at T=17-20, but I am at T=6, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, always safe, but I don't stay.\n\nAnother point: when I am moving between freeways, the note says that if I move to different y at turn T, I am not on the new freeway until next turn.\n\nBut in my sequence, when I go from y=5 to y=6 at turn T=8, action at turn 7: a7=U, so at turn 7, I am on y=5, which is safe. Then at turn 8, I am on y=6.\n\nAt turn 8, y=6, which is safe, as T=8 not in 13-15.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 4. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway, based on the car positions and movements, are as follows:\n- Freeway y=1: Always safe (no car covers x=0 at any turn).\n- Freeway y=2: Unsafe only at turn 5 (car covers x=0).\n- Freeway y=3: Unsafe at turns 17, 18, 19, 20.\n- Freeway y=4: Unsafe at turns 17, 18, 19, 20.\n- Freeway y=5: Always safe (no car covers x=0 at any turn).\n- Freeway y=6: Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 15.\n- Freeway y=7: Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 15.\n- Freeway y=8: Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 15.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach y=9 from y=2 is 7, as a net change of +7 in y-position is required, and moving up (+1) each turn achieves this without unnecessary delays.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 4 to turn 10 (7 actions) is:\n- At turn 4, action U: Move to y=3 at turn 5. At turn 4, y=2 is safe (not unsafe at turn 4).\n- At turn 5, action U: Move to y=4 at turn 6. At turn 5, y=3 is safe (unsafe at turns 17-20, not turn 5).\n- At turn 6, action U: Move to y=5 at turn 7. At turn 6, y=4 is safe (unsafe at turns 17-20, not turn 6).\n- At turn 7, action U: Move to y=6 at turn 8. At turn 7, y=5 is always safe.\n- At turn 8, action U: Move to y=7 at turn 9. At turn 8, y=6 is safe (unsafe at turns 13-15, not turn 8).\n- At turn 9, action U: Move to y=8 at turn 10. At turn 9, y=7 is safe (unsafe at turns 13-15, not turn 9).\n- At turn 10, action U: Move to y=9 at turn 11. At turn 10, y=8 is safe (unsafe at turns 13-15, not turn 10).\n\nAt turn 11, y=9 is reached, which is not a freeway and thus always safe. This sequence avoids all unsafe times on the freeways and achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 7\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe movement options are U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y remains). We can only be on a freeway row (y=1..8) at a turn when there is no car on that freeway that has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nNote: The collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k, and k is between 1 and 8) then we check the cars on freeway k at turn T: if any car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span, then collision.\n\nImportant: When moving, at turn T we are on y_T. If we move at turn T to a new row (say from y_T to y_{T+1}), then at turn T we are still on y_T and at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}. So we are only vulnerable to the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\nWe are starting at (0,3) at turn 5. We must end at (0,9) (so row 9 is the goal, which is above the freeways and has no cars).\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each future turn (relative to t1=5) the positions of the cars and check when the freeway is safe (i.e., no car has 0 in its span).\n\nLet T be the absolute turn (starting at T0 = 5). Then at a future turn T (>=5), the car that was at turn 5 with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s will be:\n\nFor a left-moving car (d = left): \n   head(T) = h - s*(T-5)\n   tail(T) = tau - s*(T-5)\n\nFor a right-moving car (d = right):\n   head(T) = h + s*(T-5)\n   tail(T) = tau + s*(T-5)\n\nBut note: the representation of the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, note that for a left-moving car, the head is at the leftmost? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: in the initial state for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and then they both move left.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the representation says: \"Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] ... Right-moving: [tau, h]\". So for right-moving, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed) but the span is [tau, head] meaning that tau is the left end and head is the right end? \n\nLooking at the example for freeway 2: \n   (0, -11, right, 12) -> at turn 5: span is [ -11, 0 ]? Because for right-moving, the representation is (head, tail) but the span is [tail, head]? The problem says: \n      Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] (so tau is the left end, h is the right end). Similarly, for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] meaning h is the left end and tau the right end? But then when moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn the car state table, we have for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48). \n   Since it's right-moving, the span at t1=5 is [tau, head] = [-95, -48]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [-95 + 48*(T-5), -48 + 48*(T-5)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12). \n   First car: right-moving, so span at t1=5: [ -11, 0 ].\n   Second car: right-moving, so span at t1=5: [37, 48]? But wait, the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving we use [tail, head]. So the second car: tail=37, head=48 -> [37,48]. \n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then the update. So we must use the tail as the left end and head as the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: freeway 5: (48,83,left,36). \n   Left-moving: span at t1=5: [head, tail] = [48,83]? Then at T, becomes [48 - 36*(T-5), 83 - 36*(T-5)].\n\nNow, we are only concerned when the car's span covers 0. So for a car at freeway k, we check at turn T if 0 is in the span [L(T), R(T)] (for a left-moving car, L(T)=head - s*(T-5), R(T)=tau - s*(T-5); for right-moving, L(T)=tau + s*(T-5), R(T)=head + s*(T-5)).\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving: the car is given as (head, tail) and the span is [head, tail]? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the order is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? But if h is the head and tau the tail, and it's left-moving, then typically the head is the front? But the span is continuous? We have to assume that the span is the interval of the car, and we need to know the endpoints.\n\nActually, the problem states the car by (head, tail) and then gives the update. The key is that the entire segment moves. We don't care about the order of head and tail? Actually, we do because the update rule is given differently for left and right. But for the purpose of containing 0, we only need the minimum and maximum of the endpoints.\n\nHowever, note the representation for left-moving: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-5), tau - s*(T-5)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire segment shifts left. But the interval [h, tau] might be increasing or decreasing? The problem does not specify that h <= tau or tau <= h. But looking at the data:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> for right-moving, the span is [tau, head] = [-95, -48] -> so from -95 to -48 (so tau=-95, head=-48: and -95 < -48, so the interval is [-95, -48]. This is a segment of length 47? But the car length is |head - tail|? Actually, the problem does not specify, but we can assume that the segment is from min to max? \n\nBut wait, the update for right-moving: [tau, head] becomes [tau + s*(T-5), head + s*(T-5)]. If tau < head, then the interval is [tau, head] and then moves right. Similarly, if tau > head, then the interval would be [head, tau] but that wouldn't make sense? \n\nLooking at the data: \n   freeway 2: first car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> so tail=-11, head=0 -> and -11<0, so the span is [-11,0]. \n   second car: (48,37,right,12) -> tail=37, head=48 -> 37<48, so [37,48].\n\nBut freeway 5: (48,83,left,36) -> left-moving: span [48,83]? Then 48<83, so the car is from 48 to 83? But then when moving left, the entire segment moves left. \n\nHowever, note that the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then the update. It does not specify that h is less than tau. But in the data, we see for left-moving: head=48, tail=83 -> so 48<83. Similarly, for right-moving, tail is less than head? \n\nIn freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-95 -> tail=-95 < head=-48 -> so for right-moving, the span [tail, head] = [-95, -48] is increasing.\n\nSo we can assume that for any car, the span at t1 is an interval [L0, R0] with L0 <= R0? Then after moving, the interval becomes [L0 + v*(T-5), R0 + v*(T-5)] for right-moving (v=s) and [L0 - v*(T-5), R0 - v*(T-5)] for left-moving? \n\nBut note: for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, head] and we have tau<=head? Similarly, for left-moving, the initial span is [head, tail] and we have head<=tail? \n\nLooking at the data: \n   All cars: \n      freeway1: (-48,-95,right,48) -> so head=-48, tail=-95 -> tail < head -> so [tau, head] = [-95,-48] -> which is increasing.\n      freeway2: first car: (0,-11,right,12) -> head=0, tail=-11 -> tail < head -> [-11,0]\n                second car: (48,37,right,12) -> head=48, tail=37 -> tail< head -> [37,48]\n      freeway3: (-36,-47,right,3) -> head=-36, tail=-47 -> tail=-47 < head=-36 -> [-47,-36]\n      freeway4: same as 3: [-47,-36]\n      freeway5: (48,83,left,36) -> head=48, tail=83 -> head<tail -> [48,83]\n      freeway6: (-32,-43,right,4) -> head=-32, tail=-43 -> tail < head -> [-43,-32]\n      freeway7,8: same as 6.\n\nSo yes, we can represent each car by an interval [L0, R0] at turn 5, and then at turn T (>=5):\n   if right-moving: [L0 + s*(T-5), R0 + s*(T-5)]\n   if left-moving: [L0 - s*(T-5), R0 - s*(T-5)]\n\nBut note: for right-moving, L0 = tail, R0 = head.\n          for left-moving, L0 = head, R0 = tail.\n\nNow, we are only concerned about the freeway we are on at a given turn. We start at turn5 at y=3. We cannot be on a freeway row (1..8) at a turn T if any car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in the interval [L(T), R(T)].\n\nWe must plan a path from y=3 to y=9 (which is safe) in minimal turns.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. We can change by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe need to avoid freeways 1..8 when they are unsafe at the turn we are on them.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway (1..8) and for each turn T (starting from 5 and going forward) whether the freeway is safe (i.e., no car covers 0).\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are independent. And each freeway has one or more cars.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k and for each relative time t (where t=0 corresponds to turn 5) the safety.\n\nLet T_abs = 5 + t, where t>=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn 5, we have the initial [L0, R0] and then at time t (so T_abs = 5+t) the car's interval is:\n\n   if direction is right: [L0 + s*t, R0 + s*t]\n   if left: [L0 - s*t, R0 - s*t]\n\nWe then check if 0 is in [min, max] of the interval. Since the car moves continuously, we can check:\n\n   For a car: if (L0 + s*t <= 0 && 0 <= R0 + s*t) for right-moving? But note: for right-moving the interval is [L0+s*t, R0+s*t] and we assume L0<=R0, so we only need:\n        L0 + s*t <= 0 <= R0 + s*t   -> then 0 is in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [L0 - s*t, R0 - s*t] -> then 0 is in the interval if:\n        L0 - s*t <= 0 <= R0 - s*t\n\nBut note: the freeway has multiple cars. The freeway is unsafe at time t if at least one car has 0 in its interval.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway (1..8) and for t from 0 up to a sufficiently large number (say 100 turns) whether the freeway is safe.\n\nBut note: we start at t=0 (turn5) and we are at y=3. We need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns in terms of vertical moves: we need to go from 3 to 9, which is 6 steps up. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars, so it might be more than 6.\n\nWe'll simulate the future turns and check the safety of each row at each turn.\n\nLet's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> so L0 = tail = -95, R0 = head = -48, direction right.\n   Interval at time t: [-95 + 48*t, -48 + 48*t]\n   Check if 0 in this interval: \n        -95 + 48*t <= 0 <= -48 + 48*t\n        => 48*t <= 95 and 48*t >= 48\n        => t <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> so t=2: 48*2=96 -> then -95+96=1, -48+96=48 -> 0 not in [1,48] -> but at t=1: -95+48=-47, -48+48=0 -> 0 is in [-47,0]? \n        Actually: at t=1: [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", and the span is a closed interval? We have to assume inclusive.\n\n        So at t=1: the car covers 0 -> unsafe at t=1.\n\n        At t=0: [-95, -48] -> 0 is not in the interval -> safe at t=0? But we are at turn5, and we are at y=3 at turn5, so we are not on freeway1 at turn5? But if we were, we would check: at t=0 (turn5) freeway1 is safe? But note: we are at turn5, and we are on y=3, so we don't care about freeway1 at turn5.\n\n        So freeway1 is unsafe at t=1? Actually, at turn6 (t=1) if we are on freeway1, then we crash.\n\n        But also at other t? \n        We have: \n           -95+48*t <= 0 <= -48+48*t\n           => 48*t >= 48 and 48*t <= 95 -> t in [1, 95/48] -> t=1 and t=2? \n           t=1: 48*1=48 -> 48>=48 and 48<=95 -> yes: then -95+48=-47<=0<=0 -> yes.\n           t=2: -95+96=1, -48+96=48 -> 0 is not between 1 and 48? -> no.\n           So only t=1.\n\n        Actually, at t=1: the interval is [-47,0] -> which includes 0? Yes, because 0 is the upper bound.\n\n        So freeway1 is unsafe only at t=1 (i.e., turn5+1=6).\n\nFreeway2: two cars.\n   Car1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> so L0 = tail = -11, R0 = head = 0, direction right.\n        Interval at t: [-11+12*t, 0+12*t] = [ -11+12t, 12t ]\n        Check: -11+12t <= 0 <= 12t\n        => 12t >= 0 -> always true for t>=0? \n           and -11+12t <=0 -> 12t<=11 -> t<=11/12≈0.916 -> so only at t=0? \n\n        At t=0: [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe at t=0? But wait, at t=0 we are at turn5, and we are not on freeway2 (we are on y=3) but if we were on freeway2 at turn5, we would crash. \n\n        Actually, at t=0: freeway2 has a car covering 0? So freeway2 is unsafe at t=0? \n\n        But note: the car is given at turn5. So at turn5, freeway2 has a car that covers 0? Then if we are on freeway2 at turn5, we crash. But we are not.\n\n        Now, what about other t? \n        For t=1: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? \n        For t=2: [-11+24,24] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        So car1 is unsafe at t=0.\n\n   Car2: (48,37,right,12) -> so L0 = tail = 37, R0 = head = 48, direction right.\n        Interval at t: [37+12t, 48+12t]\n        Check: 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t -> \n           37+12t<=0 -> t<0? -> no, so never unsafe.\n\n        So freeway2: at t=0: unsafe (because of car1), and at t>=1: safe? \n\n        Therefore, freeway2 is unsafe only at t=0 (turn5) and safe for t>=1.\n\nFreeway3: one car: (-36,-47,right,3) -> so L0 = tail = -47, R0 = head = -36, direction right.\n        Interval at t: [-47+3t, -36+3t]\n        Check: -47+3t <=0<=-36+3t\n        => 3t<=47 -> t<=47/3≈15.66\n           and 3t>=36 -> t>=12\n        So unsafe for t in [12, 15] (because t integer: t=12,13,14,15)\n\n        At t=12: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n        At t=13: [-47+39, -36+39] = [-8,3] -> 0 included? yes.\n        At t=14: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? yes.\n        At t=15: [-47+45, -36+45] = [-2,9] -> 0 included? yes.\n        At t=16: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> no.\n\n        So freeway3 is unsafe at t=12,13,14,15.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? \n   Car: (-36,-47,right,3) -> same as freeway3: unsafe at t=12,13,14,15.\n\nFreeway5: one car: (48,83,left,36) -> left-moving, so L0 = head = 48, R0 = tail = 83.\n        Interval at t: [48-36t, 83-36t]\n        Check: 48-36t <=0<=83-36t\n        => 48-36t<=0 -> 36t>=48 -> t>=48/36=4/3≈1.33 -> so t>=2\n           and 83-36t>=0 -> 36t<=83 -> t<=83/36≈2.305 -> so t<=2\n        Therefore, only t=2.\n\n        At t=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n        At t=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> safe.\n        At t=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway5 is unsafe only at t=2 (turn5+2=7).\n\nFreeway6: one car: (-32,-43,right,4) -> L0 = tail = -43, R0 = head = -32, direction right.\n        Interval at t: [-43+4t, -32+4t]\n        Check: -43+4t<=0<=-32+4t\n        => 4t<=43 -> t<=43/4=10.75 -> so t<=10\n           and 4t>=32 -> t>=8\n        So unsafe for t in [8,10] (integers: t=8,9,10)\n\n        t=8: [-43+32, -32+32] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n        t=9: [-43+36, -32+36] = [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n        t=10: [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n        t=11: [-43+44, -32+44] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6: unsafe for t=8,9,10.\nFreeway8: same: unsafe for t=8,9,10.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway (t relative to turn5, so t=0 -> turn5, t=1->turn6, etc.):\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at t=1\nFreeway2: unsafe at t=0 -> safe for t>=1\nFreeway3: unsafe at t=12,13,14,15\nFreeway4: unsafe at t=12,13,14,15\nFreeway5: unsafe at t=2\nFreeway6: unsafe at t=8,9,10\nFreeway7: unsafe at t=8,9,10\nFreeway8: unsafe at t=8,9,10\n\nWe start at turn5 (t=0) at y=3.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row at a turn when that freeway is unsafe at that relative time.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The moves: we can go up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We start at y=3 and we need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path without any obstacles would be 6 consecutive U moves: \n   t0: y=3 -> then U: y=4, then U:5, then U:6, then U:7, then U:8, then U:9 -> that's 6 moves (H=6, so from turn5 to turn10? But note: we start at turn5 (t=0) and we take actions at turn5, turn6, ... turn10? \n\nBut at each turn we are at a row:\n\n   Turn5 (t=0): y=3 (safe, because we are not on freeway? Actually, freeway rows are 1..8. Row3 is freeway3? And at t=0, freeway3 is safe? Because unsafe at t=12,13,14,15 -> so at t=0, freeway3 is safe.\n\nBut note: we are at row3 at turn5 (t=0). We are on freeway3? Yes, because freeways are rows 1..8. So we must check freeway3 at t=0: we just computed that freeway3 is safe at t=0 (since unsafe only at t=12-15). So safe.\n\nNow, we plan:\n\n   We are at y=3 at t=0 (turn5). \n   We want to get to y=9.\n\n   The path: \n        We can do: U, U, U, U, U, U -> then we go: \n          turn5 (t0): start at 3 -> action U -> then at turn6 (t1) we are at 4.\n          turn6: at 4 -> action U -> turn7: 5.\n          turn7: 5 -> U -> turn8: 6.\n          turn8: 6 -> U -> turn9: 7.\n          turn9: 7 -> U -> turn10: 8.\n          turn10: 8 -> U -> turn11: 9.\n\n   But we must check at each turn the freeway we are on:\n\n        turn5 (t=0): y=3 -> freeway3 -> safe? (because unsafe at t=12,13,14,15) -> safe.\n\n        turn6 (t=1): y=4 -> freeway4 -> at t=1: freeway4 unsafe? -> only unsafe at t=12,13,14,15 -> so safe.\n\n        turn7 (t=2): y=5 -> freeway5 -> unsafe at t=2? -> yes! freeway5 is unsafe at t=2 -> so if we are at freeway5 at turn7 (which is t=2) we crash.\n\n   So we cannot be at freeway5 at t=2.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid being at y=5 at turn7 (t=2).\n\n   How? We can delay or advance our movement.\n\n   Option 1: At turn6 (t=1) we do not move up? Instead, we stay at y=4 for one turn? Then at turn7 (t=2) we are still at y=4? Then we avoid freeway5 at t=2. But then we can move up at turn7 to y=5? But at turn7 (t=2) we are at y=4 (freeway4) which is safe? Then at turn8 (t=3) we move to y=5? Then at turn8 (t=3): freeway5 is safe? (because freeway5 unsafe only at t=2) -> safe.\n\n   Then we continue: \n        turn8: y=5 -> safe? yes (t=3: freeway5 safe)\n        turn9: y=6 -> freeway6: at t=4? freeway6 unsafe at t=8,9,10 -> t=4 is safe.\n        turn10: y=7 -> freeway7: at t=5? safe (because unsafe at t=8,9,10 -> t=5 is safe)\n        turn11: y=8 -> freeway8: at t=6? safe (unsafe at t=8,9,10 -> t=6 safe)\n        turn12: y=9 -> goal.\n\n   But wait, we are at y=9 at turn12? And 9 is not a freeway, so no car check. However, we must be at (0,9) at the last turn. This took 7 moves? (from turn5 to turn12? That would be 7 actions: at turn5,6,...,11 -> 7 actions, so H=7? \n\n   Actually, the sequence:\n\n        turn5: start at 3 -> we do U -> turn6: at 4.\n        turn6: at 4 -> we do S (stay) -> turn7: still at 4? \n        turn7: at 4 -> U -> turn8: at 5.\n        turn8: at 5 -> U -> turn9: at 6.\n        turn9: at 6 -> U -> turn10: at 7.\n        turn10: at 7 -> U -> turn11: at 8.\n        turn11: at 8 -> U -> turn12: at 9.\n\n   So we reach at turn12 (which is t=7 relative to start?).\n\n   But we must check the safety at each step:\n\n        turn5 (t=0): y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n        turn6 (t=1): y=4 -> freeway4: safe (because unsafe only at t=12-15).\n        turn7 (t=2): y=4 -> freeway4: safe? yes (t=2: freeway4 safe) -> and note: we are still at freeway4? \n        turn8 (t=3): y=5 -> freeway5: safe? (freeway5 unsafe at t=2, so t=3 is safe) -> safe.\n        turn9 (t=4): y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at t=8,9,10 -> t=4 safe.\n        turn10 (t=5): y=7 -> freeway7: unsafe at t=8,9,10 -> t=5 safe.\n        turn11 (t=6): y=8 -> freeway8: unsafe at t=8,9,10 -> t=6 safe.\n        turn12 (t=7): y=9 -> goal.\n\n   So this path is safe. But it takes 7 moves? And we started at turn5 and ended at turn12? That is 7 actions? \n\n   However, note: the goal is reached at the end of the sequence. We start at turn5 at (0,3). Then we take 7 actions: at turn5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> and then at turn12 we are at (0,9). So H=7.\n\n   But we want minimal H. Can we do better?\n\n   We lost one turn by waiting at turn6. Can we avoid waiting?\n\n   Another idea: at turn5 (t=0) we do not move up? We stay? Then:\n\n        turn5: start at 3 -> S -> turn6: still at 3? \n        Then at turn6 (t=1): we are at freeway3 -> unsafe? freeway3 unsafe at t=12,13,14,15 -> t=1 is safe? yes.\n        Then at turn6: we do U -> turn7: at 4.\n        Then at turn7 (t=2): we are at freeway4 -> safe? yes (unsafe at t=12-15) -> safe.\n        Then at turn7: we do U -> turn8: at 5 -> but at turn8 (t=3): freeway5 safe? yes (only unsafe at t=2).\n        Then we continue: \n            turn8: U -> turn9: at 6 (t=4: safe for freeway6)\n            turn9: U -> turn10: at 7 (t=5: safe for freeway7)\n            turn10: U -> turn11: at 8 (t=6: safe for freeway8)\n            turn11: U -> turn12: at 9.\n\n        This also takes 7 moves.\n\n   But we started by staying at turn5? Then we moved up at turn6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 6 moves up and one stay -> total 7 moves.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to go up immediately but avoid freeway5 at t=2 by going faster? But we cannot go faster: only one step per move.\n\n   Or we can go down? But going down would take us away from the goal.\n\n   Another idea: go up to 4 at turn6, then at turn7 we cannot be at 5? Then we can go down? But that doesn't help.\n\n   Or we can go up twice and then wait? \n\n        turn5: U -> turn6: at 4 (t=1: safe for freeway4)\n        turn6: U -> turn7: at 5 (t=2: unsafe for freeway5) -> crash -> not allowed.\n\n   So we must avoid being at 5 at t=2.\n\n   What if we go up to 4 at turn5? Then at turn6 we go up to 5? Then turn6 (t=1): we are at 5? \n        freeway5 at t=1: safe? because unsafe only at t=2 -> so safe at t=1.\n\n        Then at turn6: we are at 5 -> safe? yes.\n        Then at turn7 (t=2): we are still at 5? -> unsafe? because freeway5 unsafe at t=2 -> crash.\n\n        Or if we leave at turn7: we do U at turn6 to go to 6 at turn7? \n        turn5: U -> turn6: at 4? \n        turn6: U -> turn7: at 5? -> but wait, no: \n            At turn5: start at 3 -> U -> turn6: at 4.\n            Then at turn6: we do U -> then at turn7: at 5? -> then we are at freeway5 at t=2 -> crash.\n\n        How about: \n            turn5: U -> turn6: at 4 (t=1: safe)\n            turn6: we do not go to 5? We stay at 4? Then turn7: at 4 -> then we avoid freeway5 at t=2 -> safe.\n            Then turn7: U -> turn8: at 5 (t=3: safe) -> then we proceed.\n\n        This is the first plan we had.\n\n   But note: we could go up faster? We cannot.\n\n   Another idea: go up to 3->4->5->6 without waiting? But we have the problem at freeway5 at t=2. We are at 5 at t=2 -> crash.\n\n   How about taking a detour? For example, go to 2? But that is away from goal.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to be at freeway5 at a different time? \n\n        We need to be at y=5 at a time when freeway5 is safe. It is safe at all times except t=2.\n\n        So we can be at y=5 at t=0,1,3,4,... \n\n        But we start at y=3 at t=0. \n\n        To be at y=5 at t=1: \n            We would need to go up by 2 in one move? Impossible.\n\n        To be at y=5 at t=0: we are already at t=0 at y=3.\n\n        So we must be at y=5 at t>=3.\n\n        The earliest we can be at y=5 is t=2 if we go up twice? But that is unsafe.\n\n        The next is t=3: we can be at y=5 at t=3 by:\n\n            t0: at 3 -> move up to 4 at t1.\n            t1: at 4 -> move up to 5 at t2? -> but that is t=2 -> unsafe.\n\n            Instead: \n                t0: at 3 -> move to 4 at t1.\n                t1: at 4 -> stay at 4 at t2? Then at t2 we are at 4 -> safe.\n                t2: at 4 -> move to 5 at t3 -> then at t3 (which is safe) we are at 5.\n\n        This is the same as the first plan.\n\n   Now, after that, we have to go from 5 to 9: 4 more moves. \n\n        So from t3 to t7: \n            t3: at 5 -> move to 6 at t4.\n            t4: at 6 -> move to 7 at t5.\n            t5: at 7 -> move to 8 at t6.\n            t6: at 8 -> move to 9 at t7.\n\n        So we reach at t7 (turn5+7=12) -> same as before.\n\n   But note: we must check the next freeways: freeway6,7,8 at t=4,5,6 respectively: which are safe because unsafe only at t=8,9,10.\n\n   However, what if we can go faster? \n\n        After t3 (at 5) we can go up without waiting. \n\n        But we have to worry about freeway6,7,8: they are unsafe at t=8,9,10. \n\n        We are going to be:\n\n            t3: at 5 -> t=3: safe.\n            t4: at 6 (freeway6) -> t=4: safe (because unsafe at t=8,9,10) -> safe.\n            t5: at 7 (freeway7) -> t=5: safe.\n            t6: at 8 (freeway8) -> t=6: safe.\n            t7: at 9 -> goal.\n\n        So no problem.\n\n   But is there a way to do it in 6 moves? \n\n        We would need to be at 9 at turn11 (because 5 to 11 is 6 moves: t0 to t6?).\n\n        The timeline for 6 moves:\n\n            turn5 (t0): y=3 -> safe.\n            turn6 (t1): y=4 -> safe.\n            turn7 (t2): y=5 -> unsafe! -> cannot.\n\n        How about:\n\n            turn5: U -> y=4 at t1 (turn6) -> safe.\n            turn6: U -> y=5 at t2 (turn7) -> unsafe -> crash.\n\n        Or:\n\n            turn5: S -> y=3 at t1 (turn6) -> safe (freeway3 at t1: safe? yes, because unsafe at t=12-15) -> safe.\n            turn6: U -> y=4 at t2 (turn7) -> safe.\n            turn7: U -> y=5 at t3 (turn8) -> safe (freeway5 at t3: safe) \n            turn8: U -> y=6 at t4 (turn9) -> safe (freeway6 at t4: safe)\n            turn9: U -> y=7 at t5 (turn10) -> safe\n            turn10: U -> y=8 at t6 (turn11) -> safe\n            turn11: U -> y=9 at t7 (turn12) -> goal.\n\n        This is 7 moves: because we did 6 U and one S? Actually, we did: S, U, U, U, U, U, U -> 7 actions? \n\n        But we started at turn5 and ended at turn12: that's 7 actions? \n\n        Alternatively, without the initial S:\n\n            turn5: U -> y=4 at turn6 (t1)\n            turn6: S -> y=4 at turn7 (t2) [to avoid being at 5 at t2]\n            turn7: U -> y=5 at turn8 (t3) \n            turn8: U -> y=6 at turn9 (t4)\n            turn9: U -> y=7 at turn10 (t5)\n            turn10: U -> y=8 at turn11 (t6)\n            turn11: U -> y=9 at turn12 (t7)\n\n        Also 7 actions.\n\n   Can we do 6 actions? \n\n        We need to reach y=9 at turn11 (t6). \n\n        We start at y=3 at t0. \n\n        The sequence of moves: a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5.\n\n        The positions:\n\n            t0: 3\n            t1: 3 + a0 (a0: U->+1, D->-1, S->0)\n            t2: ... \n            t6: 9\n\n        We require: 3 + (number of U - number of D) = 9 -> so net +6. \n\n        So we need at least 6 U moves. And we have 6 moves? Then we must do 6 U moves and 0 D moves. So the sequence must be U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\n        But then:\n\n            t0:3 -> t1:4 -> t2:5 -> t3:6 -> t4:7 -> t5:8 -> t6:9.\n\n        Now check safety:\n\n            t0: y=3 -> safe (freeway3: unsafe at t=12-15 -> safe)\n            t1: y=4 -> safe (freeway4: safe at t1)\n            t2: y=5 -> unsafe! (freeway5 at t2: unsafe) -> crash.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot do 6 moves.\n\n   So minimal H is 7.\n\n   Now, we have two sequences that work:\n\n        Sequence 1: \n            turn5: U\n            turn6: S\n            turn7: U\n            turn8: U\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n\n        Sequence 2:\n            turn5: S\n            turn6: U\n            turn7: U\n            turn8: U\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n\n        But note: in sequence 2, we start at turn5: we do S -> then we are at y=3 at turn6? \n            At turn6 (t1): we are at freeway3 -> safe? yes (because unsafe at t=12-15) -> safe.\n\n        Then we do U at turn6: to y=4 at turn7 (t2) -> safe (freeway4 at t2: safe) -> then continue.\n\n   Both are valid. But we want minimal H? They both take 7 moves.\n\n   However, we must check the entire path for sequence2:\n\n        turn5 (t0): at y=3 -> freeway3: safe? yes -> we do S -> so we remain at 3? Then at the end of turn5 we are still at 3? Then at turn6 (t1) we are at 3? \n            Then at turn6 (t1): we are at freeway3 -> safe? yes -> then we do U -> then at the end of turn6 we move to 4? Then at turn7 (t2) we are at 4.\n\n        Then turn7 (t2): at 4 -> freeway4: safe? yes -> do U -> turn8: at 5 (t3) -> freeway5: safe? yes -> do U -> turn9: at 6 (t4) -> freeway6: safe? yes -> do U -> turn10: at 7 (t5) -> freeway7: safe? yes -> do U -> turn11: at 8 (t6) -> freeway8: safe? yes -> do U -> turn12: at 9.\n\n        So it works.\n\n   We can also do:\n\n        Sequence 3: \n            turn5: U -> to 4 at turn6 (t1) -> safe.\n            turn6: U -> to 5 at turn7 (t2) -> unsafe? no, because we cannot do that -> so we avoid that.\n\n        But wait, what if we do at turn5: D? That would go to 2? Then we are at freeway2 at turn6? \n\n            turn5: D -> to 2 at turn6 (t1) -> freeway2 at t1: safe? (because freeway2 unsafe only at t0) -> safe.\n            Then we are at 2 at turn6. Then we need to go to 9: that's 7 moves? So total moves would be 8? Not minimal.\n\n   Therefore, we choose between sequence1 and sequence2? Both are 7 moves.\n\n   But note: the problem asks for minimal number of turns H, which is the same. And any sequence of 7 moves that works is minimal.\n\n   We can choose one arbitrarily.\n\n   Let's choose sequence1: \n        turn5: U\n        turn6: S\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: U\n\n   But wait, in sequence1, at turn7 we do U -> then we go from 4 to 5 at turn8? Actually, let me write the state after each action:\n\n        Start: turn5 (before action): y=3.\n        turn5: do U -> then at the end of turn5, we move to 4? So at the beginning of turn6, we are at 4.\n\n        turn6: do S -> so at the end of turn6, we are still at 4. So at the beginning of turn7, we are at 4.\n\n        turn7: do U -> then at the end of turn7, we move to 5. So at turn8, we start at 5.\n\n        turn8: U -> to 6 at turn9? \n            Actually: \n                turn8: start at 5 -> do U -> then at the end of turn8: move to 6 -> so at turn9: at 6.\n\n        turn9: U -> to 7 at turn10.\n        turn10: U -> to 8 at turn11.\n        turn11: U -> to 9 at turn12.\n\n   So the actions:\n\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: S\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n\n   This is 7 actions.\n\n   Alternatively, sequence2:\n\n        Turn5: S\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n\n   But in sequence2, we end at turn12 as well? \n\n        Turn5: S -> stay at 3 -> at turn6: at 3.\n        Turn6: U -> to 4 -> at turn7: at 4.\n        Turn7: U -> to 5 -> at turn8: at 5.\n        Turn8: U -> to 6 -> at turn9: at 6.\n        Turn9: U -> to 7 -> at turn10: at 7.\n        Turn10: U -> to 8 -> at turn11: at 8.\n        Turn11: U -> to 9 -> at turn12: at 9.\n\n   Also 7 actions.\n\n   We can choose either. Let me pick sequence1.\n\n   But note: in sequence1, we are at y=4 at turn6 and turn7? \n\n        At turn6 (t1): y=4 -> freeway4: safe? yes.\n        At turn7 (t2): y=4 -> freeway4: safe? yes.\n\n   So no problem.\n\n   However, we must check if there is a car on freeway4 at t2? We have freeway4: unsafe at t=12,13,14,15 -> so safe at t2.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        Turn t_1: U   [t_1 is 5]\n        Turn t_1 + 1: S   [turn6]\n        Turn t_1 + 2: U   [turn7]\n        Turn t_1 + 3: U   [turn8]\n        Turn t_1 + 4: U   [turn9]\n        Turn t_1 + 5: U   [turn10]\n        Turn t_1 + 6: U   [turn11]\n\n   But note: we do 7 actions, so H=7, and the last action is at turn11, and then at turn12 we are at 9.\n\n   The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to t=H-1? \n\n        So t_1 + t, for t=0 to 6 (H-1=6) -> so the actions are for turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+6.\n\n   And we want the player to be at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\n        Actually, the update: after an action at turn T, the player moves to the new position at the next turn? \n\n        The rule: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\n        So after the action at turn T, the new position y_{T+1} is set.\n\n        We start at turn5: y5 = 3.\n        After action a5 (at turn5): we get y6 = y5 + Delta(a5).\n        Then after a6 (at turn6): we get y7, etc.\n\n        We require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 5+6=11) we take an action and then at turn12 (which is 5+7) we are at y12=9.\n\n        In our sequence:\n\n            a5: U -> y6 = 3+1 = 4.\n            a6: S -> y7 = 4+0 = 4.\n            a7: U -> y8 = 4+1 = 5.\n            a8: U -> y9 = 5+1 = 6.\n            a9: U -> y10 = 6+1 = 7.\n            a10: U -> y11 = 7+1 = 8.\n            a11: U -> y12 = 8+1 = 9.\n\n        So yes, at turn12 we are at 9.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: S\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n\n   But note: the problem says the sequence is for t_1 to t_1+H-1, and H=7.\n\n   Now, is there a sequence with H=7 that avoids the unsafe times and uses a detour? For example, going to row 0? But row0 is not a freeway? The freeways are only 1..8. Row0 is safe? But we start at row3 and going down to row0 would take extra moves.\n\n   Alternatively, going to row 9 via row 0? But row0 is the bottom. We can go:\n\n        turn5: D -> to 2 at turn6 -> freeway2 at t1: safe? (freeway2 unsafe at t0, so t1 safe) -> safe.\n        Then we are at 2. Then we need to go to 9: 7 moves? Then total moves: 1 (down) + 7 (up) = 8 moves -> not minimal.\n\n   So we stick with 7 moves.\n\n   We have two sequences. We can also consider:\n\n        Sequence: \n            turn5: U -> to 4\n            turn6: U -> to 5 -> but unsafe? no, we cannot.\n\n        How about:\n\n            turn5: U -> 4\n            turn6: D -> 3? Then we are back at freeway3 at t1? safe? yes. \n            turn7: U -> 4 at t3? \n            turn8: U -> 5 at t4? \n            then continue: 5->6->7->8->9: 4 more moves -> total 7 moves? \n\n            But let's count: \n                turn5: U -> 4 at turn6.\n                turn6: D -> 3 at turn7.\n                turn7: U -> 4 at turn8.\n                turn8: U -> 5 at turn9.\n                turn9: U -> 6 at turn10.\n                turn10: U -> 7 at turn11.\n                turn11: U -> 8 at turn12.\n                turn12: U -> 9 at turn13? -> then we need an 8th move.\n\n            Actually, we are at 3 at turn7? Then to go to 9 we need 6 moves: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves? So from turn7 to turn13: 6 moves? and we already did two moves? total 8 moves? \n\n        Not minimal.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal is 7, and we have two sequences that work without detour.\n\n   We'll output one of them.\n\n   But note: in the sequence we output, we have to avoid the unsafe freeway5 at t=2. In sequence1 we avoid by waiting at y=4 at t=2? \n\n        Actually, in sequence1: \n            at t0 (turn5): y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n            at t1 (turn6): y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n            at t2 (turn7): we are at y=4? -> freeway4: safe -> and we avoid freeway5 at t2.\n\n        Then we go to freeway5 at t3: safe.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Final sequence:\n\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: S\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n\n   We write it in the answer format.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\", etc.\n\n   Since t_1=5, we write:\n\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: S\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n\n   But note: we have 7 actions, so we write 7 lines.\n\n   However, the problem says: a sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1, so 7 actions.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\n   But let me double-check with the other freeways? We have freeway6,7,8 unsafe at t=8,9,10.\n\n   In our sequence:\n\n        At turn8: t = turn8 - 5 = 3 -> not in [8,9,10] -> safe.\n        At turn9: t=4 -> safe.\n        At turn10: t=5 -> safe.\n        At turn11: we are at y=8? -> freeway8 at t=6? safe.\n\n   So yes.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use the sequence without initial stay:\n\n        Turn5: S\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n\n   But then at turn5 we are at y=3 at t0: safe, and we do nothing? Then at turn6 we are still at 3? Then at turn6 (t1): freeway3: safe? yes. Then we go up to 4 at turn7? Then at turn7 (t2): freeway4: safe? yes. Then at turn8 (t3): freeway5: safe? yes. Then same as above.\n\n   This is also valid. \n\n   We choose the first one arbitrarily.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both have H=7. So either is acceptable.\n\n   I'll go with the first one that moves up immediately.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 5 is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by considering the car positions at each turn. The safety of each freeway row at specific turns is as follows:\n\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turn 6 (\\(t = 1\\) relative to turn 5).\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at turn 5 (\\(t = 0\\)), safe thereafter.\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at turns 17 to 20 (\\(t = 12\\) to \\(15\\)).\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at turns 17 to 20 (\\(t = 12\\) to \\(15\\)).\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe at turn 7 (\\(t = 2\\)).\n- Freeways 6, 7, 8: Unsafe at turns 13 to 15 (\\(t = 8\\) to \\(10\\)).\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 5 (\\(t = 0\\)) at \\(y = 3\\):\n- At turn 5 (\\(t = 0\\)), move up to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 is safe at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 1\\)).\n- At turn 6 (\\(t = 1\\)), stay at \\(y = 4\\) to avoid freeway 5 at \\(t = 2\\) (freeway 4 is safe).\n- At turn 7 (\\(t = 2\\)), move up to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 is safe at \\(t = 3\\)).\n- At turn 8 (\\(t = 3\\)), move up to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 is safe at \\(t = 4\\)).\n- At turn 9 (\\(t = 4\\)), move up to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 is safe at \\(t = 5\\)).\n- At turn 10 (\\(t = 5\\)), move up to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 is safe at \\(t = 6\\)).\n- At turn 11 (\\(t = 6\\)), move up to \\(y = 9\\), reaching the goal at turn 12.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is never on an unsafe freeway at the corresponding turn.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that same turn T, then collision.\n\nImportant: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T during turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So at turn T, we only care about the freeway we are currently on (y_T) and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe have to avoid being on a freeway row (y=1..8) at a turn when a car on that row has a span that includes x=0.\n\nWe are starting at y=4 at turn 6. We need to get to y=9. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). So we can only be on freeways 1 to 8 during the journey, but we must avoid the cars at the moment we are on that row.\n\nThe moves: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y unchanged). And we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nOur goal: minimize H (the number of turns) and output the sequence of actions from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 6+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 6 at y=4. We are going to simulate the car positions for each freeway at each future turn relative to turn 6.\n\nFirst, note that the cars are moving. For a car on freeway k, we are given its state at turn 6.\n\nWe need to compute, for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=6), the span of the car(s) on that freeway. But note: each freeway may have multiple cars. We must check all cars on a freeway for collision.\n\nLet me write down the cars at turn 6:\n\nFreeway 1: (h=0, tau=-47, d=right, s=48) -> This is a right-moving car? But note the representation: for right-moving, the head is at the right? Actually, the representation says:\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at turn 6: [tau, h] = [-47, 0]? But the table says (head=0, tail=-47, right, 48). That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me clarify the representation:\n\nFor a right-moving car: the car moves to the right. At turn t1, the head is at the rightmost part? The table says: (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s). Then:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the span at time t1 is [tau, h] and at time T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut the table entry for freeway1: head=0, tail=-47, direction=right. So at turn 6, the span is [tau, h] = [-47, 0]. Then at a future turn T, the span is [-47 + 48*(T-6), 0 + 48*(T-6)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: span at t1 is [h, tau]? But the representation says: left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nExample: freeway5: (12,47,left,36) -> so at turn6: [h, tau] = [12,47]? But wait, the representation says for left-moving: head h and tail tau? Then the span at turn6 is [12,47] (but typically we think of the car extending from 12 to 47? That would be a long car). Then at T, the span becomes [12 - 36*(T-6), 47 - 36*(T-6)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, y) at turn T, and if y is a freeway (1..8) then we require that 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway? Actually, we require that we do NOT collide, meaning that we must avoid being at a freeway row when 0 is in the span of a car on that row.\n\nSo collision condition for freeway k at turn T: if we are on row k at turn T, and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [a, b] (the span of the car at turn T) then collision.\n\nBut note: the freeway may have multiple cars. We must check each car.\n\nNow, the problem: we start at (0,4) at turn6. We are at freeway4? Actually, we are at row4. But row4 has a car? Let's check the state for freeway4 at turn6.\n\nFreeway4: (-33, -44, right, 3) -> wait, head=-33, tail=-44? and direction=right. Then the span at turn6 for this car is [tau, h] = [-44, -33] (because for right-moving, the head is the rightmost, so the car is from -44 to -33). Then at turn T, the span is [-44 + 3*(T-6), -33 + 3*(T-6)].\n\nWe note that the car on freeway4 at turn6 is from -44 to -33, which is entirely negative. So at turn6, 0 is not in [-44,-33]. But as time passes, the car moves right. When will it cover 0?\n\nWe need -44 + 3*(T-6) <= 0 <= -33 + 3*(T-6)\n\nBut note: the car moves at 3 units per turn. So:\n\nLet dT = T-6.\n\nWe require: \n  -44 + 3*dT <= 0  => 3*dT <= 44 => dT <= 44/3 ≈ 14.666 -> so dT <= 14 for the left bound? Actually, we require the entire car to cover 0? Actually, we require 0 to be in the interval [left, right] = [-44+3*dT, -33+3*dT].\n\nSo:\n  left = -44+3*dT <= 0  => dT <= 44/3 ≈14.666 -> so for dT=0 to 14, left is <=0? Actually, for dT>=15, left = -44+45=1>0? Let me compute:\n\ndT=14: left = -44+42 = -2, right=-33+42=9 -> 0 is in [-2,9] -> yes, 0 is in the span at dT=14? Actually, at dT=14: [-2,9] includes 0.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway4 is only one? The table says only one car? Actually, the table has multiple entries per row? Let me see:\n\nFreeway2 has two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12). So we must check both.\n\nBut for freeway4, there is only one car: (-33,-44,right,3). Actually, the table says for freeway4: (-33,-44,right,3) and that's it? But the representation in the table is a list? Actually, the table has one row per freeway, and the cars are listed. So:\n\nFreeway1: one car: (0,-47,right,48)\nFreeway2: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\nFreeway3: one car: (-33,-44,right,3) -> but wait, the table says freeway3: (-33,-44,right,3) and then freeway4: same? Actually, the table:\n\n| 1 | (0, -47, right, 48) |\n| 2 | (12, 1, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12) |\n| 3 | (-33, -44, right, 3) |\n| 4 | (-33, -44, right, 3) |   <--- same as freeway3?\n| 5 | (12, 47, left, 36) |\n| 6 | (-28, -39, right, 4) |\n| 7 | (-28, -39, right, 4) |\n| 8 | (-28, -39, right, 4) |\n\nSo freeway3 and freeway4 have the same car? That seems odd. But we'll take the data as given.\n\nNow, we need to plan a path from y=4 at turn6 to y=9 at some future turn, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe are going to consider moving up (U), down (D), or staying (S). We start at y=4.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\nAt turn T, if we are at y=k (k in 1..8) then we must check that for every car on freeway k at turn T, 0 is not in the car's span.\n\nWe are going to simulate for each turn starting from turn6, and for each possible y (0..9) and see the minimal steps to reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we can model this as a graph where nodes are (turn, y) and edges are moves (U,D,S) that are valid (y in [0,9]) and that avoid collisions.\n\nWe start at (6,4). We want to reach (T,9) for the smallest T>=6.\n\nWe'll compute the car positions for each freeway and for each turn we are going to consider.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 6 and going until we find a solution) the set of cars and their spans, then check if 0 is in any of them for that k and T.\n\nBut note: we don't care about freeway k if we are not on row k at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nFirst, we note the cars:\n\nLet dT = T - 6.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on k, we have:\n\nFreeway1: one car: (h0=0, tau0=-47, d='right', s=48)\n  -> For turn T: \n      left = tau0 + s*dT = -47 + 48*dT   [because right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau0 + s*dT, h0+s*dT] = [-47+48*dT, 0+48*dT]\n      right = h0 + s*dT = 48*dT\n  We require that 0 is not in [left, right] = [-47+48*dT, 48*dT].\n\n  When is 0 in that interval?\n      -47+48*dT <= 0 <= 48*dT\n      => 48*dT >= 0 (always true for dT>=0) and -47+48*dT <=0 -> 48*dT <=47 -> dT <=47/48 -> dT=0? \n      At dT=0: left=-47, right=0 -> 0 is in [-47,0]? Yes, because it includes 0? Actually, the interval is [left, right] inclusive? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", and the span is [a,b] meaning inclusive? I think so.\n\n  So at dT=0 (turn6): 0 is in [-47,0] -> so freeway1 is occupied at turn6? But wait, we are at y=4 at turn6, so we are not on freeway1? We are on freeway4? So we don't care about freeway1 at turn6? But if we were to be on freeway1 at turn6, we would collide.\n\n  However, we are at freeway4 at turn6. So we must check freeway4 at turn6.\n\nFreeway4: one car: (h=-33, tau=-44, d='right', s=3)\n  -> For right-moving: [tau, h] at turn6: [-44, -33] -> becomes [ -44+3*dT, -33+3*dT ]\n  At dT=0: [-44,-33] -> 0 is not in this interval -> safe at turn6 for freeway4.\n\n  But we are at freeway4 at turn6 -> so we are safe at turn6.\n\nNow, what about the next turns? We need to plan.\n\nWe are at turn6, y=4. We can choose: U (go to y=5), D (go to y=3), or S (stay at y=4).\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at the current turn for the row we are on? Actually, at the current turn we are already at row4 and we know it is safe. So we can choose any move, but then at the next turn we will be at a new row (or same) and we must check that row at that next turn.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn6: we are at (6,4) -> safe.\n\nThen we choose an action for turn6 (which will determine our position at turn7).\n\nLet me denote the state: (turn, y) and we want to avoid being at (T, k) for k in 1..8 and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are going to compute the car spans for each freeway and for each dT (T-6) until we find a path.\n\nWe'll try to go as fast as possible: we want to go up to 9, so ideally we do U 5 times: but we start at 4, so 4->5->6->7->8->9: that would take 5 turns. But we must check if we can be on rows 5,6,7,8 at the respective turns without collision.\n\nSo let's compute the car positions for freeways 5,6,7,8 for dT=1 (turn7), dT=2 (turn8), dT=3 (turn9), dT=4 (turn10), dT=5 (turn11).\n\nBut note: we are going to be on:\n\nturn6: y=4 -> safe (as above)\nturn7: we plan to go to y=5 (if we choose U) -> then we must check freeway5 at turn7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=5 at turn7, then at turn8 we go to y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn8, and so on.\n\nBut what if we have to wait? We might need to stay or even go down to avoid a collision.\n\nWe'll compute the safety of each row for each turn.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway k and for dT=0,1,2,... until say dT=20 (we can extend if needed) whether 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at turn T = 6 + dT.\n\nWe do for k=1 to 8:\n\nFreeway1: \n  car1: [ -47+48*dT, 48*dT ]\n  0 is in the interval if: -47+48*dT <= 0 <= 48*dT\n  => 0 <= 48*dT (always true for dT>=0) and 48*dT <= 47 -> dT <= 47/48 < 1 -> so only at dT=0? \n      dT=0: -47<=0<=0 -> 0<=0 is true -> so at dT=0, freeway1 is occupied.\n      dT=1: left = -47+48=1, right=48 -> [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe for freeway1 at dT>=1.\n\nFreeway2: two cars.\n  car1: (12,1,right,12) -> at dT: [1+12*dT, 12+12*dT]  [because tau=1, h=12? But wait: the representation: for right-moving: [tau, h] -> so [1,12] at dT=0 -> becomes [1+12*dT, 12+12*dT]\n      Check 0 in [1+12*dT, 12+12*dT]: \n          1+12*dT <= 0 <= 12+12*dT -> \n          First: 1+12*dT<=0 -> 12*dT<=-1 -> impossible since dT>=0 -> so never.\n  car2: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*dT, 60+12*dT] -> all positive -> 0 never in.\n\n  So freeway2 is always safe? \n\nBut wait: the table says (head, tail) for car1: (12,1) -> that means at dT=0, the car is from 1 to 12? Then 0 is not in [1,12]. And as time goes, it moves right, so always positive.\n\nFreeway3: one car: (-33,-44,right,3) -> [ -44+3*dT, -33+3*dT ]\n  0 in [-44+3*dT, -33+3*dT] if:\n      -44+3*dT <= 0 <= -33+3*dT\n      => \n        -44+3*dT <=0 -> 3*dT<=44 -> dT<=14.666 -> dT<=14\n        and 0<=-33+3*dT -> 3*dT>=33 -> dT>=11.\n\n      So for dT in [11,14] (inclusive) -> freeway3 is occupied.\n\n      Specifically: \n        dT=11: left=-44+33=-11, right=-33+33=0 -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> yes.\n        dT=12: left=-44+36=-8, right=-33+36=3 -> [ -8,3] -> 0 in.\n        dT=13: left=-44+39=-5, right=-33+39=6 -> [ -5,6] -> 0 in.\n        dT=14: left=-44+42=-2, right=-33+42=9 -> [ -2,9] -> 0 in.\n        dT=15: left=-44+45=1, right=-33+45=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\n      So freeway3 is unsafe for dT=11,12,13,14.\n\nFreeway4: same car as freeway3? The table says: (-33,-44,right,3) -> same as freeway3. So same unsafe for dT=11,12,13,14.\n\nFreeway5: one car: (12,47,left,36) -> left-moving: [h, tau] = [12,47] at dT=0? Then becomes [12-36*dT, 47-36*dT]\n  0 in [12-36*dT, 47-36*dT] if:\n      12-36*dT <= 0 <= 47-36*dT\n      => \n        12-36*dT<=0 -> 36*dT>=12 -> dT>= 12/36 = 1/3 -> so dT>=1 (since integer)\n        and 0<=47-36*dT -> 36*dT<=47 -> dT<=47/36≈1.305 -> so dT=1.\n\n      At dT=1: left=12-36=-24, right=47-36=11 -> [-24,11] -> 0 is in? yes.\n\n      So freeway5 is unsafe only at dT=1.\n\n      dT=0: [12,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n      dT=1: unsafe.\n      dT=2: [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nFreeway6: (-28,-39,right,4) -> [ -39+4*dT, -28+4*dT ]\n  0 in [-39+4*dT, -28+4*dT] if:\n      -39+4*dT<=0<=-28+4*dT\n      => \n        -39+4*dT<=0 -> 4*dT<=39 -> dT<=9.75 -> dT<=9\n        and 0<=-28+4*dT -> 4*dT>=28 -> dT>=7.\n\n      So dT in [7,9] -> unsafe.\n\n      dT=7: left=-39+28=-11, right=-28+28=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n      dT=8: left=-39+32=-7, right=-28+32=4 -> [-7,4] -> 0 in.\n      dT=9: left=-39+36=-3, right=-28+36=8 -> [-3,8] -> 0 in.\n      dT=10: left=-39+40=1, right=-28+40=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6: (-28,-39,right,4) -> same: unsafe for dT=7,8,9.\n\nFreeway8: same: unsafe for dT=7,8,9.\n\nSummary of unsafe (row, turn) pairs:\n\nWe express turn T = 6 + dT.\n\nRows:\n  1: unsafe only at dT=0 -> turn6: unsafe.\n  2: always safe.\n  3: unsafe at dT=11,12,13,14 -> turns 17,18,19,20.\n  4: same as 3: unsafe at dT=11,12,13,14 -> turns 17,18,19,20.\n  5: unsafe at dT=1 -> turn7.\n  6: unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> turns 13,14,15.\n  7: same as 6: unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> turns 13,14,15.\n  8: same as 6: unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> turns 13,14,15.\n\nNow, we start at turn6, y=4. We are at row4 at turn6: which is safe (dT=0: row4 is safe? But note: row4 is unsafe only at dT>=11? So at dT=0, safe).\n\nWe want to go to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe consider the moves:\n\nOption 1: Go straight up: 4->5->6->7->8->9 in 5 moves.\n\nBut we must check each step:\n\nturn6: y=4 -> safe (we are at row4, which is safe at dT=0).\n\nThen we choose U at turn6: then at turn7, we are at y=5.\n\nBut row5 at turn7 (dT=1) is unsafe! (because dT=1 for freeway5: unsafe). So we cannot be at row5 at turn7.\n\nSo going U at turn6 leads to collision at turn7.\n\nOption 2: Stay at turn6: then at turn7 we are still at y=4. Then at turn7 (dT=1), we check row4: \n  row4: unsafe only at dT>=11? dT=1 is safe. So we can stay.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 at turn7. Then we can try to go up at turn7? Then at turn8 we are at y=5.\n\nAt turn8: dT=2, row5: safe (because row5 only unsafe at dT=1). So y=5 at turn8 is safe.\n\nThen we can go: \n  turn6: S (stay) -> y=4\n  turn7: U -> y=5 (at turn8: safe)\n\nThen at turn8 (dT=2) we are at y=5 -> safe. Then we can do U again to y=6 at turn9.\n\nAt turn9: we are at y=6, dT=3. \n  row6: unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> so dT=3 is safe? Yes.\n\nThen we can go to y=7 at turn10? \n  turn10: dT=4, row7: unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at turn11: dT=5, row8: safe? row8 unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn12: which is safe because y=9 has no cars.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  turn6: S\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U -> now at y=6 at turn9? Wait, let me write the turns:\n\nLet me denote:\n  Turn6: start at y=4.\n  Action at turn6: S -> so at turn7, y=4? Actually, the update: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and we are at turn6: action a6 determines y7.\n\nSo:\n  Turn6: a6 = S -> then at turn7, y7 = 4 + 0 = 4.\n  Turn7: a7 = U -> then at turn8, y8 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n  Turn8: a8 = U -> then at turn9, y9 = 5+1=6.\n  Turn9: a9 = U -> then at turn10, y10=6+1=7.\n  Turn10: a10= U -> then at turn11, y11=7+1=8.\n  Turn11: a11= U -> then at turn12, y12=8+1=9.\n\nWe must check the safety at each turn we are on a freeway:\n\n  At turn6: we are at y=4 -> safe (as above).\n  At turn7: we are at y=4 -> freeway4: dT=1 (since T=7 -> dT=1) -> row4 is safe at dT=1 (because unsafe only at dT>=11).\n  At turn8: we are at y=5 -> freeway5: dT=2 -> safe (because unsafe only at dT=1).\n  At turn9: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: dT=3 -> safe (unsafe at dT=7,8,9? no, dT=3 is safe).\n  At turn10: y=7 -> freeway7: dT=4 -> safe (unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> dT=4 safe).\n  At turn11: y=8 -> freeway8: dT=5 -> safe.\n  At turn12: y=9 -> safe (no car).\n\nSo total turns: from turn6 to turn12: that's 7 turns? But note: we are at turn6 and we do 6 actions: at turn6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 6 actions? And we reach y=9 at turn12? Then H=7? Because the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and we start at t1=6 and end at t1+H-1 = 6+7-1=12? Yes.\n\nBut can we do better? We did a stay at the beginning. What if we go down first? \n\nAt turn6: we are at y=4. We could go down to y=3? Then at turn7: we are at y=3.\n\nBut row3: at turn7 (dT=1) -> unsafe? We computed row3: unsafe at dT=11,12,13,14 -> so at dT=1, safe.\n\nThen we can go up from there? But then we have to go from 3 to 9: that's 6 moves, so total turns would be at least 7? Same as above? Or more? \n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the stay at the beginning by going up at a later time? \n\nBut we cannot go up at turn6 because then at turn7 we are at y=5 which is unsafe. So we must avoid being at y=5 at turn7.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  turn6: D -> to y=3 at turn7? Then at turn7 we are at y=3 (safe). Then we can go up:\n\n  turn7: U -> y=4 at turn8 -> safe? at turn8: row4 at dT=2 -> safe.\n  turn8: U -> y=5 at turn9 -> row5 at dT=3: safe (only unsafe at dT=1).\n  turn9: U -> y=6 at turn10 -> row6 at dT=4: safe (unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> safe).\n  turn10: U -> y=7 at turn11 -> row7 at dT=5: safe.\n  turn11: U -> y=8 at turn12 -> row8 at dT=6: safe (unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> safe? dT=6 is safe).\n  turn12: U -> y=9 at turn13.\n\nThat takes 7 moves? And we end at turn13? That's worse than the previous (which ended at turn12).\n\nIn the first plan we ended at turn12 (with 6 actions: from turn6 to turn11, and the last action at turn11 brings us to y=9 at turn12). So H=7 (turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 -> 7 turns) and we did 6 actions? Actually, the problem: we start at turn6 and we do actions at turn6, turn7, ... until turn6+H-1? and we reach (0,9) at the end of the last action? \n\nThe player update: after action a_t, we get y_{t+1}. So:\n\n  At turn6: we do a6 -> then at turn7 we have y7 = y6 + Delta(a6).\n  ...\n  At turn6+H-1: we do a_{6+H-1} -> then at turn6+H, we have y_{6+H} = ... \n\nBut we require that at the last turn (turn6+H-1) we are at (0,9)? Or that at the next state we are at (0,9)? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then after the last action we should be at (0,9). But note: after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we get the state at turn t1+H. So we require that at turn t1+H we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? Actually, the definition: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, with action at t.\n\nSo after the action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. Therefore, to have y_{t1+H} = 9, we need to have taken H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the first plan:\n\n  Actions at turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11 (that's 6 actions, so H=6? But then we get y12 at the end? Let me see:\n\n  Start: turn6, y6=4.\n  After a6 (at turn6): we get y7.\n  After a7 (at turn7): we get y8.\n  ...\n  After a11 (at turn11): we get y12.\n\nSo we did H=6 actions? Then we are at turn12. So the minimal H? But the problem says: the minimal number of turns H? Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", but then the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? So H is the number of actions? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. And we are to output the actions for turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we require that at the end, we are at (0,9) at the state after the last action? So after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the last turn? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me check: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the state at the same turn as the last action is at y=9? \n\nBut the update rule: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThis means that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? Or at the end? \n\nThe problem says: \"Player Position: (0, y_t)\" at turn t. So at the beginning of turn t, we are at (0,y_t). Then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). That means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\nBut note: we don't need to do an action at that turn? Because the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: that is, we do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 (the last action turn) we are at y=9? \n\nThat would mean we are at y=9 at the beginning of that turn? Then we do an action? But we are already at 9? And we are required to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nBut what if we get to 9 earlier? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we must be at 9 at the end of the last action? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we do the last action a_{t1+H-1}? But that action might move us away? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence. And the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we do an action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T, we don't need to do an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we must do an action at that turn. But what if we do S? then we stay at 9. But if we do U, we go to 10 -> invalid? Actually, the rule: y_{t+1} in [0,9] -> so if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9? The problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, but then clipped? The rule says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\", but the update equation doesn't specify clipping. However, the condition is \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So we assume that if the move would take us out of bounds, we stay? Or the move is not allowed? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\" and the move is defined as +1, -1, 0. So if we are at 9 and do U, then y_{t+1} would be 10, which is not in [0,9] -> so we must avoid that? Actually, the problem doesn't specify what happens. But in the update rule, it says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so we assume that the move is clipped. But to be safe, we should avoid moving beyond. However, we can do S at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. Then we do an action at that turn? But the problem requires that we output the action for that turn. And then after that action, we are at y_{t1+H} which could be 9 (if we do S) or 8 (if we do D) or 10 (if we do U, then clipped to 9?).\n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9. It only says to reach (0,9) at the last turn? And the last turn is turn t1+H-1? \n\nSo we must be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we can do any action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9. So we can do S, U, or D? But if we do U or D, then we leave 9? \n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", meaning we just need to get there at some turn? And then we can leave? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nRe-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" \n\nIt says \"to reach (0,9)\", meaning that the state (0,9) must be achieved at some point? And the minimal H? But the condition in the problem is: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we must have that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\nThen we do an action at that turn? But we are already at 9. So the minimal H is the first time we are at 9 at the beginning of a turn.\n\nAnd then we do an action at that turn? But the problem doesn't require that we stay? It just requires that we reach 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo in our first plan, we did:\n\n  turn6: y6=4 -> then we do S -> so at the beginning of turn7: y7=4.\n  turn7: do U -> at the beginning of turn8: y8=5.\n  turn8: do U -> at the beginning of turn9: y9=6.\n  turn9: do U -> at the beginning of turn10: y10=7.\n  turn10: do U -> at the beginning of turn11: y11=8.\n  turn11: do U -> at the beginning of turn12: y12=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn12, we are at y=9. And we have taken H-1=11-6? Wait, the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1: \n  t=0: turn6\n  t=1: turn7\n  ...\n  t=5: turn11\n\nSo we have 6 actions? Then H=6? And we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn12? But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> that would be y_{6+6-1}=y_{11}=9? But at the beginning of turn11, we were at y=8.\n\nSo that does not meet the condition.\n\nWe must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn12. So we need to set t1+H-1=12 -> 6+H-1=12 -> H=7.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn6 to turn12-1? That is, turn6 to turn11: 6 actions? But H=7? So we have 7 turns? \n\nThe problem says: the minimal number of turns H. And the sequence has H actions? Because t from 0 to H-1 -> H actions.\n\nBut then the turn indices: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at the beginning of turn12 (which is t1+6, since 6+6=12) we are at y=9. So we have:\n\n  t1+H-1 = 6+H-1 = 12? -> H=7.\n\nThen the actions are for turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 6 actions? But H=7? So the sequence has 6 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> so for H=7, t goes from 0 to 6? That would be 7 actions: for turns 6,7,8,9,10,11,12? \n\nBut then at turn12 we do an action? And we are already at y=9 at the beginning of turn12? Then we do an action? But we only care about being at 9 at the beginning of turn12? \n\nThe condition is: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> here t1+H-1=6+7-1=12 -> so we require y_{12}=9 at the beginning of turn12.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Actions at turn6 to turn12: that's 7 actions.\n\nBut in our plan, we only need 6 actions to get to y=9 at turn12. So we can do:\n\n  turn6: S -> y7=4\n  turn7: U -> y8=5\n  turn8: U -> y9=6\n  turn9: U -> y10=7\n  turn10: U -> y11=8\n  turn11: U -> y12=9\n\nThen at turn12: we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn12. Then we must do an action at turn12? But we are already at 9. And we are required to output an action for turn12? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1 -> H=7, so t=0,1,...,6 -> turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nSo we need an action for turn12. Since we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12, we can do S (stay) to remain at 9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: S   [to stay at 9]\n\nBut is that minimal H? H=7.\n\nBut note: we could have reached y=9 earlier? \n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  turn6: D -> to y=3 at turn7? \n  turn7: U -> to y=4 at turn8\n  turn8: U -> to y=5 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> to y=6 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> to y=7 at turn11\n  turn11: U -> to y=8 at turn12\n  turn12: U -> to y=9 at turn13\n\nThen we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn13. So we set t1+H-1=13 -> 6+H-1=13 -> H=8 -> worse.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the first stay by going up at a later time? \n\nBut we cannot go up at turn6 because of the car on row5 at turn7.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  turn6: U -> then at turn7 we are at y=5 -> unsafe? So collision? So we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=3 at turn7? Then we can go up and then we have to go through row5 at a safe time.\n\nRow5 is unsafe only at turn7 (dT=1). So we can be at row5 at any other turn.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  turn6: D -> to y=3 at turn7 (safe: row3 at dT=1 is safe)\n  turn7: S or U? We want to go up. Let's do U: then at turn8: y=4 -> safe (row4 at dT=2 safe)\n  turn8: U -> at turn9: y=5 -> safe (row5 at dT=3 safe)\n  turn9: U -> at turn10: y=6 -> safe (row6 at dT=4 safe)\n  turn10: U -> at turn11: y=7 -> safe\n  turn11: U -> at turn12: y=8 -> safe\n  turn12: U -> at turn13: y=9\n\nBut we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn13. Then we need to set H such that t1+H-1=13 -> H=8. Then we have 8 actions? From turn6 to turn13? And we need an action at turn13? We can do S at turn13.\n\nBut this is worse (H=8) than the first plan (H=7).\n\nIn the first plan, we had:\n\n  turn6: S -> y7=4\n  turn7: U -> y8=5\n  turn8: U -> y9=6\n  turn9: U -> y10=7\n  turn10: U -> y11=8\n  turn11: U -> y12=9\n  turn12: S -> y13=9? Actually, at turn12: we are at y=9 at the beginning. Then we do S -> y13=9.\n\nBut we are required to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn12? So we don't need to do the action at turn12? But the sequence must have H=7 actions: from turn6 to turn12.\n\nAnd the condition is that at the beginning of turn12 (which is t1+H-1=6+7-1=12) we are at y=9. So we have achieved the goal at the start of turn12. Then we do an action at turn12? But we don't care what happens after? The problem only requires to reach (0,9) at the last turn (meaning turn12). But note: the last turn in the sequence is turn12, and we are at (0,9) at the beginning of that turn.\n\nSo the action at turn12 is still needed? But we are already at 9. So we can do S.\n\nBut can we avoid that extra action? \n\nWhat if we reach 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWe start at turn6 at y=4. The minimal number of moves to go from 4 to 9 is 5 moves (all U). But we cannot do that in the first 5 moves because of the car on row5 at turn7.\n\nWe have to wait at least one turn? So the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn12? \n\nAt turn12: we are at y=9 at the beginning. So we require H such that t1+H-1=12 -> H=7.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nNow, in the first plan, we did:\n\n  Actions: \n      turn6: S\n      turn7: U\n      turn8: U\n      turn9: U\n      turn10: U\n      turn11: U\n      turn12: S   [but we could do anything? However, we are at 9, so we must do S to stay? Or we can do U and it will clip? But the problem doesn't specify clipping. To be safe, we do S.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we remain at 9, only that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12. Then we do an action? But the problem doesn't specify what happens after. However, we must output an action for turn12.\n\nSo we output S.\n\nBut is there a sequence that uses H=7 but without the last S? \n\nWe must have 7 actions. We need to be at y=9 at turn12 (the beginning). The only way to be at y=9 at turn12 is to have been at y=8 at turn11 and done U at turn11? Or at y=9 at turn11 and done S? Or at y=10? but we cannot.\n\nSo we must have either:\n\n  Option A: \n      turn11: y11=8, then a11=U -> y12=9 -> so at the beginning of turn12, we are at 9.\n      Then we do a12 (the last action) at turn12: which must be output.\n\n  Option B:\n      turn11: y11=9, then a11=S (or any action that leaves us at 9) -> then at turn12 we are at 9.\n\nBut in option A, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12? No: at turn11 we were at 8, then we do U at turn11: then at turn12 we are at 9. So at the beginning of turn12, we are at 9? \n\nYes: the state at the beginning of turn12 is set by the action of turn11. \n\nSimilarly, in the sequence:\n\n  turn11: we do U -> then the state at turn12 is 9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12. Then we do an action at turn12? \n\nBut the condition is satisfied at the beginning of turn12. And we have to do an action at turn12? \n\nIn the sequence for H=7, we do actions at turn6,7,8,9,10,11,12. \n\nSo we do need an action at turn12.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7.\n\nNow, is there a sequence that doesn't require the last action? No, because the sequence must have H actions.\n\nSo the first plan is valid.\n\nBut note: we have an alternative: we could do:\n\n  turn6: S -> y7=4\n  turn7: U -> y8=5\n  turn8: U -> y9=6\n  turn9: U -> y10=7\n  turn10: U -> y11=8\n  turn11: U -> y12=9\n  turn12: S\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n  turn6: D -> y7=3\n  turn7: U -> y8=4\n  turn8: U -> y9=5\n  turn9: U -> y10=6\n  turn10: U -> y11=7\n  turn11: U -> y12=8\n  turn12: U -> y13=9\n\nBut then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn13? Then we need H such that t1+H-1=13 -> H=8. Then we do an action at turn13? So that's worse.\n\nSo the first sequence is minimal.\n\nBut wait: in the first sequence, we did a stay at turn6 and then all U. But we could do:\n\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: S   [stay at 4] \n  turn8: U   -> to 5 at turn9: safe (dT=3 for row5: safe)\n  then continue: \n      turn9: U -> 6 at turn10: safe (dT=4 for row6: safe)\n      turn10: U -> 7 at turn11: safe\n      turn11: U -> 8 at turn12: safe\n      turn12: U -> 9 at turn13\n\nThen we are at 9 at the beginning of turn13? Then H=8? Worse.\n\nSo the minimal is H=7.\n\nNow, we must output:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} -> turn6: S\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} -> turn7: U\n...\nTurn t1+6: a_{t1+6} -> turn12: S\n\nBut note: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1=6, so 7 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have:\n\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: S\n\nThat's 7 actions.\n\nBut we must check the safety at the intermediate steps again:\n\n  At the beginning of turn6: y6=4 -> safe (row4 at dT=0: safe).\n      Action: S -> then y7=4.\n  At the beginning of turn7: y7=4 -> row4 at dT=1: safe? (dT=1: row4 unsafe only at dT>=11 -> safe).\n      Action: U -> then y8=5.\n  At the beginning of turn8: y8=5 -> row5 at dT=2: safe? (only unsafe at dT=1 -> safe).\n      Action: U -> y9=6.\n  At the beginning of turn9: y9=6 -> row6 at dT=3: safe? (unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> dT=3 safe).\n      Action: U -> y10=7.\n  At the beginning of turn10: y10=7 -> row7 at dT=4: safe (unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> safe).\n      Action: U -> y11=8.\n  At the beginning of turn11: y11=8 -> row8 at dT=5: safe (unsafe at dT=7,8,9 -> safe).\n      Action: U -> y12=9.\n  At the beginning of turn12: y12=9 -> safe (no car).\n      Action: S -> y13=9.\n\nBut the condition is that at turn12 (which is t1+H-1=6+7-1=12) we are at y=9? Yes.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn12: we are at y=9 and we do S. That's valid.\n\nWe could do U at turn12? Then we would go to 10, which is invalid? But the rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we assume it is clipped to 9? Then we are still at 9? So we can do U as well? But the problem doesn't specify. To be safe, we do S.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we remain at 9? It only requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12. After that, we can do any action? So we can do any action? But we must output one. So we can choose any.\n\nBut to be consistent, we output S.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid the last action by having H=6? But we cannot be at y=9 at turn11? \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn11 (the beginning), we would have to have been at y=8 at turn10 and done U at turn10? Then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nBut then we set t1+H-1=11 -> 6+H-1=11 -> H=6.\n\nBut we have to check the safety:\n\n  We start at turn6: y6=4.\n  We need to get to y=8 at turn10? and then U at turn10 to get to 9 at turn11.\n\n  How to get to y=8 at turn10? That means from turn6 to turn10: 5 moves? We start at 4, need to go to 8: that's 4 moves? So we can do 4 U's and one S? \n\n  Possibility:\n\n      turn6: U -> but then at turn7: y=5 -> unsafe? So we cannot.\n\n  Alternatively, we do:\n\n      turn6: S -> y7=4\n      turn7: U -> y8=5 (safe at turn8: dT=2 for row5 -> safe)\n      turn8: U -> y9=6 (safe at turn9: dT=3 for row6 -> safe)\n      turn9: U -> y10=7 (safe at turn10: dT=4 for row7 -> safe)\n      turn10: U -> y11=8 (at the beginning of turn11: we are at y=8 -> safe? row8 at dT=5: safe) -> then we do U at turn10? But then we get y11=9? \n\n      Actually, at the beginning of turn10: we are at y10=7? Then we do U: then at turn11: y11=8? \n\n      But we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn11? \n\n      How? We need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn11. That means we must have done an action at turn10 that moved from 8 to 9? But we were at 7 at the beginning of turn10? Then we do U: we get to 8 at turn11? Not 9.\n\n      Alternatively, we do two U's in one turn? Not allowed.\n\n  So we cannot get to y=9 by turn11.\n\n  Minimal time: we must take at least 5 moves (U) to go from 4 to 9. But we cannot do the first U at turn6 because of the car at row5 at turn7. So we have to start the first U at turn7 at the earliest? \n\n  Then:\n\n      turn7: U -> to 5 at turn8\n      turn8: U -> to 6 at turn9\n      turn9: U -> to 7 at turn10\n      turn10: U -> to 8 at turn11\n      turn11: U -> to 9 at turn12\n\n  Then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12? Then H=7.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nWe can also choose to do U at turn12? But it would have the same effect (if clipped). But to be explicit, we do S.\n\nAnother possibility: what if we do:\n\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: S   [stay at 5]? Then we are at 5 at turn9: safe? Then we can continue.\n\nBut that would take more turns? \n\n  turn6: S -> y7=4\n  turn7: U -> y8=5\n  turn8: S -> y9=5\n  turn9: U -> y10=6\n  turn10: U -> y11=7\n  turn11: U -> y12=8\n  turn12: U -> y13=9\n\nThen we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn13? Then H=8. Worse.\n\nSo the sequence we have is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring \\(H = 7\\) turns. The actions are chosen to navigate safely through the freeways, considering the car movements and collision conditions.\n\nThe unsafe turns for each freeway, derived from the car states and their movements, are:\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turn 6 (\\(dT = 0\\)).\n- Freeway 3 and 4: Unsafe at turns 17, 18, 19, 20 (\\(dT = 11, 12, 13, 14\\)).\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe at turn 7 (\\(dT = 1\\)).\n- Freeways 6, 7, and 8: Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 15 (\\(dT = 7, 8, 9\\)).\n\nStarting at turn 6, position \\(y = 4\\) (safe at turn 6), the sequence avoids these unsafe states:\n- **Turn 6 (current turn)**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\), which is safe (freeway 4 is safe at \\(dT = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 7**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\). At turn 8 (\\(dT = 2\\)), freeway 5 is safe (unsafe only at \\(dT = 1\\)).\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\). At turn 9 (\\(dT = 3\\)), freeway 6 is safe (unsafe at \\(dT = 7, 8, 9\\)).\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\). At turn 10 (\\(dT = 4\\)), freeway 7 is safe (unsafe at \\(dT = 7, 8, 9\\)).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\). At turn 11 (\\(dT = 5\\)), freeway 8 is safe (unsafe at \\(dT = 7, 8, 9\\)).\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\). At turn 12, \\(y = 9\\) is safe (no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n- **Turn 12**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached and an action is required for the last turn.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 12 (satisfying \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{12} = 9\\)) with \\(H = 7\\) turns. No shorter sequence is possible due to the collision on freeway 5 at turn 7 if moving up immediately at turn 6.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with a constant speed, and their positions are given at turn t_1, which is 7. I need to find actions for turns starting from t_1 to some turn when I reach y=9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't check collision for the new y until I'm actually there.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each future turn based on the given state at t_1=7.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway. Freeway k means y=k, I assume.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFor y=1: one car: head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48. Since it's right-moving, span at t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nThe update says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=t1, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for right-moving, head and tail are given with head > tail? In the state, for y=1, it's (48,1,right,48), so head=48, tail=1, and since it's right-moving, at t1, span is [1,48], I think, because tail to head increasing.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", and for update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=t1, this is [τ, h], so if τ < h, it's from τ to h, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], at T=t1, [h, τ], so if h > τ, it's from τ to h? No.\n\nFor left-moving, at t1: Span(t1) = [h, τ]? The notation says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" for left-moving? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], which for left-moving, if h and τ are such that it's moving left, so if h > τ, then [h, τ] might be decreasing, but in terms of interval, it's from min to max, I think we need to consider the span as an interval.\n\nBut for collision, it's about whether 0 is in the span, so we care about the position of the car parts.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, for y=1: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48). Since d=right, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [1,48], and it moves right, so position increases with time.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T if after the action, y_T is the position.\n\nAt turn T, after action, position is y_T, and we check for freeway y_T if 0 is in any car's span on that row at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I move, I'm not on the new row yet for that turn's collision check. Only at the next turn I am on it.\n\nBut for collision, it's per turn based on current position.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player has position y_t. Then chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}, and we check collision for that position at turn t+1.\n\nThe collision condition is given: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for turn T, you are on y_T, and for turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for each turn, based on your position, you check the cars on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, for the cars, we need to compute their span at each turn T.\n\nt1 = 7 is the starting turn.\n\nSo let's define the time from t1: let τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, T=t1=7.\n\nThen for each car, we can write span as function of τ.\n\nFirst, list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)  // tail is τ, but τ is used for time, I'll use \"tail\" for car tail.\n\nIn notation, it's tail τ, but to avoid confusion, I'll call it tail_pos or something.\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor y=1: car: head=48, tail=1, dir=right, speed=48\n\nAt time τ (after t1), span for right-moving: [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] = [1 + 48τ, 48 + 48τ]\n\nSimilarly, for y=2: two cars\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12)  // head=24, tail=13? But for right-moving, at t1, span should be [tail, head] = [13,24]? But 13 to 24, that's small.\n\nhead=24, tail=13, so if right-moving, [13,24] at τ=0.\n\nThen at τ, [13 + 12τ, 24 + 12τ]\n\nSecond car on y=2: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nhead=-48, tail=-59? tail=-59, head=-48, so [tail, head] = [-59, -48] at τ=0.\n\nAt τ, [-59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ]\n\ny=3: one car (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nhead=-30, tail=-41, right-moving, so [tail, head] = [-41,-30] at τ=0\n\nAt τ, [-41 + 3τ, -30 + 3τ]\n\ny=4: same as y=3? (-30,-41,right,3) identical to y=3.\n\nBut different freeways, so separate.\n\ny=4: car (-30,-41,right,3), so same as y=3: at τ, [-41 + 3τ, -30 + 3τ]\n\ny=5: car (-24,11,left,36)  // head=-24, tail=11? But left-moving.\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, span is [h, τ] but τ is tail, let's use \"t\" for tail.\n\nThe notation: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo at τ=0, [h, tail] for left-moving.\n\nHere head=-24, tail=11, and since left-moving, [h, tail] = [-24, 11]? But -24 to 11, that's increasing, but left-moving should decrease position? Inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the [h, τ] is the interval, and for left-moving, it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nBut the span at t1 is [h, tail], which for left-moving, if h is head and tail is tail, but in terms of position, if it's moving left, head should be left of tail or something? I think I need to interpret the values.\n\nFor example, in y=2, first car (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, since right-moving, tail=13, head=24, so from 13 to 24.\n\nFor left-moving, like y=5: head=-24, tail=11, left-moving. At t1, span is [h, tail] = [-24, 11]. But -24 to 11, which is from left to right, but since it's left-moving, it will move to decreasing positions.\n\nAt τ, Span = [h - sτ, tail - sτ] = [-24 -36τ, 11 -36τ]\n\nSimilarly, y=6: car (-24,-35,right,4)  // head=-24, tail=-35, right-moving, so at τ=0, [tail, head] = [-35,-24], at τ, [-35 +4τ, -24 +4τ]\n\ny=7: same as y=6? (-24,-35,right,4), identical.\n\ny=8: same, (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have cars, but for collision, we care when 0 is in the span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince freeways are separate, we need for each y from 1 to 8, the times when a car is at position 0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, find the set of τ where 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nThen, at turn T, with τ = T - t1, if player is on y, and for that y, at τ, 0 is in the span of a car, then collision.\n\nPlayer wants to be on a freeway y only when for that y, at that τ, 0 is not in any car span.\n\nAlso, for y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so always safe. But y=0 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so player is safe there.\n\nIn the position, y=0 and y=9 are allowed, and no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), so at some turn, be at y=9.\n\nNow, start at y=4 at τ=0 (turn t1=7).\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up, since 4 to 9, difference 5, so minimum 5 turns if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or avoid cars.\n\ny changes only by -1,0,+1 per turn, so from 4 to 9, at least 5 up actions, and possibly some stays or downs, but downs would make it longer, so minimal turns should have no downs, I think, unless necessary to avoid.\n\nBut since cars might block, I might need to stay or even down to avoid.\n\nBut let's first find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each y, find τ such that there exists a car on y with 0 in its span at τ.\n\nThen, player can be on y at τ only if for that y, at τ, no car has 0 in span.\n\nFor y=1: one car, span [1 + 48τ, 48 + 48τ]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 48τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 48τ\n\nSince τ ≥ 0, 1+48τ >0 for τ≥0, so 1+48τ >0, and 48+48τ >0, so 0 is less than lower bound, so 0 not in [1+48τ, 48+48τ] for any τ≥0 because lower bound >0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound >0, but lower bound min is 1 at τ=0, which is >0, so for all τ, 1+48τ ≥1 >0, so 0 is not in the interval. So on y=1, never occupied at x=0. So y=1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right? [1+48τ, 48+48τ], since τ≥0, 1+48τ ≥1, so the smallest position is at least 1, so x=0 is never covered. So yes, y=1 is always free, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nNow y=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [13 + 12τ, 24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in this if 13+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 24+12τ\n\nBut 13+12τ ≥13>0 for τ≥0, so 0 < lower bound, not ≤, so never true.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [-59 +12τ, -48 +12τ]\n\n0 in this if -59+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12τ\n\nWhich is 12τ ≤ 59 and 12τ ≥ 48, so τ ≤ 59/12 = 4.916, and τ ≥ 48/12 = 4.\n\nSo for τ from 4 to 4.916, but τ integer?

Safe, as above.\n\nNow, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5: but y=5 is unsafe only at τ=0, not at τ=1. At τ=1, y=5 should be safe.\n\ny=5 car: at τ=1, span [-24-36(1), 11-36(1)] = [-60, -25], all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=3, or stay y=4.\n\nBut going up is towards goal.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at τ= something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nSince min turns, let's try to go up every turn.\n\nSequence: start τ=0, y=4\n\nAfter action, at τ=1, y=?\n\nIf action at τ=0 (turn t1) is U, then at τ=1, y=5\n\nAt τ=1, y=5: safe, as above.\n\nThen at τ=1, action U, to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=6: now y=6 unsafe at τ=6,7,8, not τ=2, so should be safe.\n\ny=6 car: at τ=2, span [-35 +4*2, -24 +4*2] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27, -16], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action U at τ=1 to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, position y=6, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=7 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=7: y=7 unsafe at τ=6,7,8, not τ=3.\n\nCar at y=7: same as y=6, span [-35+4*3, -24+12] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12], negative, safe.\n\nAction U to y=8 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=8: y=8 unsafe at τ=6,7,8, not τ=4? τ=4 not in 6,7,8.\n\nCar: [-35+4*4, -24+16] = [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8], negative, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=9: y=9 always safe, no cars. So reached.\n\nNow, actions: from τ=0 to τ=4, we moved up each time.\n\nAt τ=0, start y=4, after action U, at τ=1 y=5\n\nAfter action at τ=1 U, at τ=2 y=6\n\nAction at τ=2 U, at τ=3 y=7\n\nAction at τ=3 U, at τ=4 y=8\n\nAction at τ=4 U, at τ=5 y=9\n\nNow, at τ=5, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nHere at τ=5, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, number of turns: from τ=0 to τ=5, that's 5 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nτ = T - t1, so at τ=0, T=t1=7, position y=4.\n\nAfter action at T=7, we go to next turn.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt T=t1=7, y=4.\n\nChoose action a_{7}, then y_{8} = y_7 + Δy\n\nThen at turn 8, position y_8, check collision.\n\nSimilarly, turn 9, y_9, etc.\n\nIn terms of τ: τ=0: T=7, y=4\n\nAfter action a_{7}, y_{8} set.\n\nThen at T=8, τ=1, y=y_8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt T=7 (τ=0), position y=4, safe.\n\nAction a_{7} = U, then y_{8} = 4 +1 =5\n\nAt T=8 (τ=1), position y=5, which is safe as above.\n\nAction a_{8} = U, then y_{9} =5+1=6\n\nAt T=9 (τ=2), position y=6, safe.\n\nAction a_{9} = U, then y_{10} =6+1=7\n\nAt T=10 (τ=3), position y=7, safe.\n\nAction a_{10} = U, then y_{11} =7+1=8\n\nAt T=11 (τ=4), position y=8, safe? At τ=4, y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=6,7,8, τ=4 not in, so safe.\n\nAction a_{11} = U, then y_{12} =8+1=9\n\nAt T=12 (τ=5), position y=9, safe, goal reached.\n\nSo from T=7 to T=12, that's 6 turns: T=7,8,9,10,11,12 but at T=7 we start, and at T=12 we reach.\n\nThe turns involved: actions at T=7,8,9,10,11 to reach y=9 at T=12.\n\nH is the number of turns from start, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" such that after H actions, at turn t1+H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=7.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn my sequence: actions at t=7,8,9,10,11 (5 actions), then at turn 12, position y=9.\n\nt1+H =7 + H =12, so H=5.\n\nActions for t from t1 to t1+H-1: t=7 to 11, that's 5 actions: a7 to a11.\n\nThen at t1+H =7+5=12, position y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, at each step, we were safe.\n\nBut let's verify the unsafe points.\n\nIn particular, at T=11 (τ=4), y=8, which is safe, as above.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at τ=4, but we are not on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIs there any issue at T=10?\n\nT=10, τ=3, y=7, safe.\n\nT=9, τ=2, y=6, safe.\n\nT=8, τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nT=7, τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nAnd T=12, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to make sure about the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=4, y=2 is unsafe, but we are on y=8, not affected.\n\nBut in this path, we didn't encounter any unsafe position.\n\nBut is y=5 safe at τ=1? Yes.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at y=5.\n\ny=5: car left-moving, at τ=1, span [-24 -36(1), 11-36(1)] = [-60, -25], all positions negative, so x=0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the beginning, at τ=0, y=5 is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nNow, but we have y=6,7,8 unsafe at τ=6,7,8, but we are at τ=5 when we reach y=9, so we didn't go through those times on those rows.\n\nτ=6,7,8 are later.\n\nIn this case, with H=5, we reached in 5 actions.\n\nBut is it possible in less? From y=4 to y=9, min 5 up moves, so 5 actions, each moving up, so H=5 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we have a sequence that works.\n\nBut let's check if at any point we might have collision.\n\nFor example, at T=11, τ=4, y=8.\n\ny=8 car: at τ=4, span [-35 +4*4, -24 +16] = [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8], not including 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut what about y=2 at τ=4? But we are not on y=2.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the player position: when we are on a row, we only care about that row's cars at that turn.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=2, at τ=4, there is a car at x=0, but since we are on y=8, no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo with 5 up actions, we can reach.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nt1=7.\n\nAction at t=7: U\n\nThen at t=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nThen at t=12, y=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=7 to t=11, actions U each.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nWhat about y=5 at τ=0? But we are not on it.\n\nAnother thing: in the path, we went through y=5 at τ=1, which is safe.\n\nBut let's see if we can start immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if staying or down is needed, but in this case not.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if we were to go slower, we might hit unsafe times, but here we avoided.\n\nFor instance, if we stayed at y=4 for some turns, but y=4 unsafe at τ=10-13, which is later, not issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in this direct path, we are fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns.\n\nStart at T=7, y=4.\n\nAfter first action U at T=7, y=5 at T=8.\n\nAfter second U at T=8, y=6 at T=9.\n\nAfter third U at T=9, y=7 at T=10.\n\nAfter fourth U at T=10, y=8 at T=11.\n\nAfter fifth U at T=11, y=9 at T=12.\n\nSo at T=12, position (0,9).\n\nActions: a7, a8, a9, a10, a11 all U.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence.\n\nBut is H=5 possible? Seems so.\n\nBut let's double-check if at any point, the position is unsafe.\n\nAt T=8 (τ=1), y=5: car on y=5 at τ=1: span [-60,-25], not include 0, safe.\n\nT=9 (τ=2), y=6: car [-27,-16], not include 0, safe.\n\nT=10 (τ=3), y=7: car [-23,-12], not include 0, safe.\n\nT=11 (τ=4), y=8: car [-19,-8], not include 0, safe.\n\nT=12 (τ=5), y=9, no car, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut what about the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nIn this case, for example, at turn T=7, we are on y=4, action U, so we move to y=5 at next turn.\n\nAt turn T=7, we are on y=4, and we check for y=4 at T=7, which is safe.\n\nNot on y=5 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, on y=5, check y=5 at T=8, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in H=5.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,4) at turn t1=7.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 12.\n\nBut let's see if we can do in less, but from 4 to 9, min 5 steps, so no.\n\nUnless we start at y=4, and after 4 actions? After k actions, y increases by net up minus down, so to increase by 5, min 5 up actions, no down, so min 5 actions.\n\nThus H=5 is minimal.\n\nAnd we have a sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=2, at τ=4, which is T=11, y=2 is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, others not issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there is any constraint that forces us to wait.\n\nFor example, if we wanted to go to y=6 later, but we went at τ=2, which is fine.\n\nSuppose we stay at some point.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? No, min 5 moves.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=0, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nIf we could teleport, but no.\n\nSo I think H=5 is achievable.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +4: a_{t_1+4} = U\n\nt1=7, so:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12, position (0,9).\n\nIn the answer, it should be in box.\n\nBut let's write the actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=5, so t=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut in the format.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\end{array} } \n\nBut the turn numbers are absolute.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSince t1=7 given.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nPerhaps just list.\n\nAnother thing: I think I missed something.\n\nIn the car state, for y=5, it was unsafe at τ=0, but we didn't go at τ=0.\n\nBut what about the player starting.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=4.\n\ny=4 is safe at τ=0.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at τ=0, but not relevant.\n\nIn the path, when we go to y=5 at τ=1, safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=5.\n\nCar: head=-24, tail=11, left-moving, speed=36.\n\nAt τ=0, span [-24,11], which includes 0, so if player were on y=5 at τ=0, collision, but not.\n\nAt τ=1, span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], not include 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6,7,8 at τ=6,7,8 unsafe, but we are before that.\n\nτ=6 is T=13, etc., later.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path if we go down or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=3, then we need more steps to come back, so worse.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is five Up actions.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the box, it should list the actions with turn numbers.\n\nSince t1=7, and H=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12: position (0,9)\n\nBut the sequence ends at turn 11 action.\n\nIn the box, as per format.\n\nPerhaps write:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thought: in the car state, for y=2, there is a car at τ=4, T=11.\n\nBut at that time, we are on y=8, not y=2.\n\nBut just to make sure, is there any car that affects multiple rows? No, each row separate.\n\nAlso, the note about moving: when you move, at the turn you move, you are not on the new row yet, which we handled.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps if we start by staying, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if at τ=0 we stay, y=4 still, then later go, but then it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal and achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all Up for 5 turns.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 5. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn, increasing the y-coordinate by 1 each turn, reaching y=9 after 5 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 7, action U moves to y=5 at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, action U moves to y=6 at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, action U moves to y=7 at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, action U moves to y=8 at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, action U moves to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nCollision avoidance is confirmed for each position:\n- At turn 8 (τ=1), y=5: car span is [-60, -25], 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 9 (τ=2), y=6: car span is [-27, -16], 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 10 (τ=3), y=7: car span is [-23, -12], 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 11 (τ=4), y=8: car span is [-19, -8], 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 12 (τ=5), y=9: no cars, safe.\n\nThe unsafe times for other freeways (e.g., y=2 at τ=4) do not affect the player since they are not on those freeways at those times.\n\nThus, the sequence minimizes \\(H\\) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\end{array} }",

So at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T and only checks the car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions (U, D, or S) starting from turn t1 (which is 8) until the turn when the player reaches y=9.\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to y=8) with car configurations at turn t1=8.\n\nLet me note the car configurations at turn 8 for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: (96,49,right,48) -> This is a right-moving car. Since it's right-moving, the span at turn t1=8 is [tau, h] = [49, 96]? But wait, the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is at the front (higher x) and tail at the back (lower x). So the span is [tail, head] = [49,96]. But note: the update rule for right-moving is: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the head is at the front (lower x) and tail at the back (higher x)? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> then Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation for left-moving: the example given for left-moving in the update rule has the head at h and tail at tau, and the span is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau (with h <= tau? but then moving left, the head is the leading part so it should be at a lower x?).\n\nActually, let me clarify the representation:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  At t1: the car is represented as (head, tail, direction, speed) and the span is [tail, head] (because tail is the rear, which is at a lower x, and head at higher x). So the update for right-moving: \n      head(T) = head(t1) + s*(T-t1)\n      tail(T) = tail(t1) + s*(T-t1)\n  Therefore, the span at T is [tail(t1)+s*(T-t1), head(t1)+s*(T-t1)]\n\nFor a left-moving car:\n  At t1: the car is represented as (head, tail, direction, speed). The update rule says: \n      head(T) = head(t1) - s*(T-t1)\n      tail(T) = tail(t1) - s*(T-t1)\n  So the span at T is [head(T), tail(T)] = [head(t1)-s*(T-t1), tail(t1)-s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the representation, for a left-moving car, the head is the front (so it should be at a higher x than the tail at the start?) but when moving left, the head moves to lower x. However, the problem gives for left-moving: \n  \"Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> Span(T)=[h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo the representation (h, tau) for left-moving: h is the head and tau is the tail, and the span is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau in increasing x? But wait, if the car is moving left, then at time t1, the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, no: in the update rule, the entire car moves left. So the head (which is the front) is at a higher x value? But when moving left, the head will become at a lower x? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: the head is the leading part. For a left-moving car, the leading part (head) is at the leftmost? Actually, no: when moving left, the front of the car is the leftmost part? \n\nLet me reinterpret with the given example for freeway 5: (-60, -25, left, 36). \nAt turn 8, the car is at span [head, tail] = [-60, -25]? Then at a later turn T, the span becomes [-60 - 36*(T-8), -25 - 36*(T-8)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, freeway) at turn T and 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nSo for freeway 5 (which is y=5) at turn T, we require 0 to be in [ -60 - 36*(T-8), -25 - 36*(T-8) ].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: right-moving car: (96,49,right,48). Then at turn T, the span is [49+48*(T-8), 96+48*(T-8)].\n\nWe are to avoid any turn T (from t1=8 onwards) in which the player is on a freeway k (y=k) and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at y=5 at turn 8. So at turn 8, we must check freeway 5: \n  Freeway 5: [head, tail] = [-60, -25] at turn 8? But wait, the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-60, -25, left, 36). For left-moving, the update rule says the span at T is [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)]? But the problem states for left-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), tau - s (T-t1)]\n\nSo at T=8: [h, tau] = [-60, -25]. Then at T=8, the span is [-60, -25]. Does 0 lie in [-60, -25]? \n  -60 <= 0 <= -25 -> no, because 0 is greater than -25? So 0 is not in [-60, -25]? Actually, -60 <= 0 is true, but 0<=-25 is false. So 0 is not in the interval. Therefore, at turn 8, the player is safe on freeway 5.\n\nBut note: the representation for the car might be [min, max] or [max, min]? The update rule for left-moving: the span is [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the head (which was at -60) becomes more negative, and the tail (at -25) also becomes more negative. So the entire car moves left.\n\nThe interval at time T is [a, b] where a = head - s*(T-t1) and b = tail - s*(T-t1). For T=8: a=-60, b=-25. The interval is from -60 to -25 (in increasing order). So it's [-60, -25]. 0 is not in this interval.\n\nSimilarly, for the right-moving car: the span is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nNow, we must plan the moves from turn 8 (y=5) to y=9 (which is the goal, and note that y=9 is not a freeway with cars, so we only care about the journey through y=1 to y=8).\n\nWe can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nSince the grid is small (only 10 rows) and the number of turns might be small, we can try to simulate the moves and check for collisions at each step.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving continuously and their positions are linear in time. So for a given freeway k and a turn T (>=t1), we can compute the car's span and check if 0 is in that span.\n\nLet me write a helper function for each freeway:\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T (relative to t1=8, so T>=8), we compute the span of the car(s) on that freeway. Note: some freeways have multiple cars? \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96,49,right,48)\nFreeway 2: two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\nFreeway 3: one car: (-27,-38,right,3)\nFreeway 4: one car: (-27,-38,right,3) -> same as freeway3?\nFreeway 5: one car: (-60,-25,left,36)\nFreeway 6: one car: (-20,-31,right,4) -> note: tail=-31, head=-20? But for right-moving, the tail should be the leftmost and head the rightmost? So -31 is the tail (left) and -20 is the head (right). Then the span is [-31, -20] at T=8? Then at T, it becomes [-31+4*(T-8), -20+4*(T-8)].\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (-20,-31,right,4)\nFreeway 8: same as 6? (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nBut note: freeway 2 has two cars. So at turn T, we have two spans. The player collides if at turn T, the player is on freeway 2 and 0 is in either of the two spans.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 3 and 4, they have the same car? But they are different freeways? Actually, freeway 3 is y=3, freeway4 is y=4. So they are independent.\n\nNow, we need to simulate from turn 8 (y=5) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (state: (turn_offset, y)) to find the minimal steps. The turn_offset is the number of steps from the start (t1=8). So at step 0 (turn 8), we are at y=5.\n\nWe want to minimize the total turns (H). The goal is when we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the time (turn) matters because the cars move as time progresses.\n\nIn BFS, we consider:\n\nstate: (t, y) where t is the absolute turn (starting at 8, then 9,10,...) and y in [0,9].\n\nBut the state space is not too big because we can limit the number of turns. The minimal steps in terms of vertical moves: from 5 to 9 is 4 steps up. But we might have to wait (S) to avoid collisions.\n\nSo we can try BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1) over states (t, y) for t from 8 up to, say, 8+20 (we can set a limit, 20 might be safe).\n\nWe'll generate next states by choosing U, D, S (if the next y is within [0,9]). Then for each next state (t+1, y_next), we must check that at the turn t (the current turn from which we are moving) we are safe: meaning if we are on a freeway (y in {1,2,...,8}), then we must check that no car on that freeway at turn t has 0 in its span.\n\nNote: at turn t, we are at (0, y) and we are about to move. So at turn t, we are on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and we check the car(s) on freeway y at turn t.\n\nBut note: when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so we are safe.\n\nAlso, when we move from y to y_next at turn t, then at turn t we are on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn t). Then at turn t+1, we will be on y_next and we check the car on freeway y_next at turn t+1? Actually, no: the state (t+1, y_next) will be checked when we leave that state by making a move? Actually, when we are at state (t, y), we are about to take an action that will lead to state (t+1, y_next). The collision check for state (t, y) is done at the time we are in that state (i.e., at turn t) for the freeway y (if applicable).\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nWe start at state (t=8, y=5). We check if we are safe at (8,5): \n  freeway 5: car (-60,-25,left,36) -> span at t=8: [-60, -25] -> 0 not in [-60,-25]? Actually, -60<=0<=-25 -> false because 0>-25. So safe.\n\nThen we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we choose U: then next y = 5+1 = 6, at turn 9 we are at (0,6). But before that, at turn 8 we are at (0,5) and we are safe (as above). Then at turn 9, we will be at (0,6) and then we check the car on freeway 6 at turn 9? Actually, when we are at state (9,6), we are about to take an action at turn 9. But we must check that at turn 9, we are on freeway 6 and the car on freeway 6 at turn 9 must not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S: we stay at (0,5) at turn 9? Then at turn 9 we are still at (0,5) and we must check freeway 5 at turn 9.\n\nSo we need a function: is_safe(t, y) that returns True if at turn t, being on freeway y (if y is 1..8) is safe (i.e., no car on that freeway at turn t has 0 in its span), and if y=0 or y=9, then always safe.\n\nLet's write the function for is_safe(t, y):\n\nif y==0 or y==9: return True\n\nelse: \n  for each car on freeway y (from the given list for that freeway) at turn t (relative to t1=8, so elapsed time = t-8):\n\n    if the car is right-moving: \n        tail_t = tail_0 + s*(t-8)\n        head_t = head_0 + s*(t-8)\n        if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t: then collision -> return False\n\n    if the car is left-moving:\n        head_t = head_0 - s*(t-8)\n        tail_t = tail_0 - s*(t-8)\n        if head_t <= 0 <= tail_t: then collision -> return False\n\nBut note: for left-moving, the span at time t is [head_t, tail_t] and we require head_t <= tail_t? Actually, in the update rule, the head moves to the left (more negative) and the tail also moves to the left. So at time t, the head_t (which is the leftmost) is less than tail_t? Actually, no: initially at t=8, for freeway5: head_0=-60, tail_0=-25, and -60 < -25, so the interval is [-60, -25] (from -60 to -25). So we require the condition: head_t <= 0 <= tail_t? But note: head_t is the left end and tail_t is the right end? Actually, the problem states the span as [head_t, tail_t] meaning the entire segment from head_t to tail_t. So we require head_t <= 0 <= tail_t? \n\nBut in the freeway5 example at t=8: head_t=-60, tail_t=-25, and we want to check 0: \n  -60 <= 0 is true, but 0 <= -25 is false. So 0 is not in [-60, -25]? Actually, the interval is from -60 to -25, and 0 is greater than -25, so it's not in the interval.\n\nSo the condition for left-moving: we require head_t <= 0 and 0 <= tail_t? But note: the representation for left-moving: the head is the leftmost and tail is the rightmost? So the interval is [head_t, tail_t] and we require head_t <= 0 <= tail_t.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the interval is [tail_t, head_t] and we require tail_t <= 0 <= head_t.\n\nSo the condition is the same: the car's segment must cover 0.\n\nBut note: for freeway2, we have two cars. So we must check both.\n\nNow, let's write the car data for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head_0=96, tail_0=49, direction='right', speed=48)\nFreeway 2: two cars: \n   car1: (36,25,right,12)\n   car2: (-36,-47,right,12)   -> note: tail_0=-47, head_0=-36? Then the interval at t=8: [-47, -36] for this car? Then at time t, the interval becomes [-47+12*(t-8), -36+12*(t-8)]\nFreeway 3: (-27,-38,right,3) -> but wait: tail_0=-38, head_0=-27? So at t=8: [-38, -27]? Then at time t: [-38+3*(t-8), -27+3*(t-8)]\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3? (-27,-38,right,3) -> same as above.\nFreeway 5: (-60,-25,left,36) -> at t=8: [-60, -25]? Then at time t: [-60-36*(t-8), -25-36*(t-8)] -> which becomes more negative.\nFreeway 6: (-20,-31,right,4) -> note: the representation is (head_0, tail_0) = (-20,-31) for a right-moving car? But then the tail_0=-31, head_0=-20. So the interval at t=8: [-31, -20]. Then at time t: [-31+4*(t-8), -20+4*(t-8)]\nFreeway 7: same as 6: (-20,-31,right,4) -> same as above.\nFreeway 8: same as 6: (-20,-31,right,4) -> same.\n\nBut wait, for freeway6,7,8: the car is given as (-20,-31,right,4). But note: the representation says (head, tail). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So the initial span is [tail, head] = [-31, -20]. That matches.\n\nHowever, for freeway3 and 4: the car is (-27,-38,right,3). Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [-38, -27]. So the tail is -38 and head is -27.\n\nNow, we can simulate.\n\nWe'll use BFS (queue) that stores (t, y, path) where t is the absolute turn, y is the current y, and path is the sequence of actions taken so far (from turn 8 to the current turn). We start at (8,5, []).\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at any turn. The first time we reach y=9 we return the path (which will be minimal in turns).\n\nBut note: when we are at (t, y) and we take an action, we go to (t+1, y_next). We must check that when we are at (t, y) we are safe (because that's the turn we are on that freeway). The only exception is the starting state: we already checked (8,5) is safe? Actually, we check when we pop the state: we must check that the state (t, y) is safe? But we are going to use this state to generate next states, and the safety of (t,y) is necessary.\n\nBut note: we start at (8,5) and we know it is safe. Then when we generate a next state (9, y1), we must check that (9,y1) is safe? Actually, no: at the moment we are at (9,y1), we haven't taken an action at turn 9 yet, but we are at (9,y1) and we are about to take an action. However, the safety of (9,y1) is that we were on freeway y1 at turn 9. So we must check that state (9,y1) is safe.\n\nBut when we generate the state (9,y1) from (8,y0) by an action, we must check that at turn 8, the state (8,y0) is safe (which we already know because we are in the state) and then also that at turn 9, the state (9,y1) is safe? Actually, no: the state (8,y0) was already checked when we entered it? And then we take an action at turn 8 to move to (9,y1). The state (9,y1) will be checked when we pop it from the queue? But we want to avoid generating unsafe states.\n\nAlternatively, we can check the safety of the next state (t+1, y_next) when generating it. Because if (t+1, y_next) is not safe, then we cannot use that state.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nLet Q be a queue. We start with (t=8, y=5, path=[]).\n\nWe mark visited states: (t,y) to avoid duplicates. Since we are doing BFS by time, and we want minimal turns, we can break when we first reach y=9.\n\nWhile Q is not empty:\n   pop state (t, y, path)\n   if y==9: return path (and the number of turns H = len(path)+1? Actually, the path is the sequence of actions from turn8 to the last turn. But note: we start at turn8, then we take an action at turn8 to go to turn9, etc. The goal is to be at y=9 at some turn. The sequence of actions is for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action that gets us to 9.\n\n   But note: we are at state (t,y). We have taken actions for turns from 8 to t-1? Actually, no: the state (t,y) is the state at the beginning of turn t. We have taken actions at turns 8,9,...,t-1 to get to (t,y). Then at turn t, we are at (0,y) and we are about to take an action.\n\n   However, the problem asks for the actions starting at turn t1 (which is 8). So we have to record the actions taken at each step.\n\n   Actually, we start at turn8: we are at (0,5). Then we choose an action a_{8}. Then we move to turn9 at y6 (if we chose U, for example). Then at turn9, we choose a_{9}, etc.\n\n   So in our BFS, the state (t,y) represents the state at the start of turn t (before taking the action). The path stored is the sequence of actions taken from turn8 to turn t-1.\n\n   Then if we are at (t,y) and we haven't reached y=9, we consider the next action at turn t: \n        for each action in [U, D, S]:\n            compute next_y = y + delta (if in [0,9])\n            then the next state is (t+1, next_y) and the new path = path + [action]\n\n            Then we check if (t, y) is safe? But wait: we are at (t,y) and we are going to take an action at turn t. The safety of (t,y) must be checked because we are on that freeway at turn t. However, we already assumed that the state (t,y) is safe because we are in the state? Actually, when we popped the state (t,y) we must have checked that it is safe? \n\n   But how? We check when we generate the state: when we generated (t,y) from a previous state, we checked that (t,y) is safe? Actually, no: we only checked the previous state? \n\n   Correction: \n\n   We start at (8,5) and we know it is safe (we checked). Then we generate next states for turn8: \n        We consider actions at turn8: then we will be at (9, y_next). \n        But before leaving (8,5), we must ensure that at turn8 we are safe? We already know that. \n        Then when we generate the state (9, y_next), we must check that at turn9, the state (9, y_next) is safe? Not exactly: the state (9, y_next) is the state at the beginning of turn9. At turn9, we are at (0, y_next) and we are about to take an action. But we must check that at turn9, being at y_next is safe? Yes.\n\n   However, note: at the moment we are at state (8,5) and we take an action at turn8 to go to (9,6) (if U). Then during the move at turn8, we are at (0,5) at turn8 (safe) and then we move to (0,6) at the next turn. But we are not on freeway6 at turn8? So we don't check freeway6 at turn8. \n\n   So the safety check for the state (t,y) is done when we are about to use it (i.e., when we generate it as a next state from a parent) OR when we pop it? Actually, we can check at the time of popping: \n\n        When we pop (t,y,path), we first check if (t,y) is safe. If not, we skip. \n        Then if y==9, we return the path (which is the sequence of actions taken from turn8 to turn t-1) because at turn t we are at y=9 and we don't need to take an action? \n\n   But wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H turns (starting at turn t1) we are at (0,9). \n\n   How does the sequence work? \n        At turn t1 (8): we take a0 = a_8 -> then at the end of turn8 we are at y1 = 5 + delta0.\n        Then at turn t1+1 (9): we take a1 = a_9 -> then at the end of turn9 we are at y2 = y1 + delta1.\n        ... until at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at y = 9.\n\n   So the state at the start of turn t1 is (0,5). Then after H actions (taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1), we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\n   Actually, the state after an action at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\n   Therefore, if we are at state (t, y) (at the beginning of turn t) and we take an action a_t, then we move to state (t+1, y + delta).\n\n   We want to have at the beginning of some turn T, y=9. Then we don't take any further action? Actually, the problem says: the sequence of actions until we reach (0,9). So the last action is the one that moves us to y=9? \n\n   Example: \n        Start: turn8: y=5.\n        If we take U at turn8: then at the beginning of turn9, we are at y=6.\n        Then if we take U at turn9: at the beginning of turn10, we are at y=7.\n        ... until we take the 4th U at turn11: then at the beginning of turn12, we are at y=9 -> then we stop.\n\n   So the sequence of actions: \n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: U\n\n   Then H=4.\n\n   But note: at the beginning of turn12, we are at y=9 and we don't take an action at turn12? \n\n   The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\n   And note: the update: \n        y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\n   So after H actions (from t=t1 to t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n   Therefore, the state at turn t1+H is (0,9). \n\n   So in our BFS, we are looking for a state (t,9) for some t>=8. The number of turns H = t - 8? \n\n   But note: we start at turn8: we haven't taken any action. Then we take an action at turn8: then we are at turn9. So after k actions, we are at turn8+k.\n\n   We want: at turn8+H, we are at y=9. Then the sequence of actions is for turns 8, 8+1, ... 8+H-1. So the number of actions is H.\n\n   Therefore, when we are at state (t, y) and y=9, then H = t - 8? But then the sequence of actions is the path that we have (which has length = t-8).\n\n   Example: we start at (8,5). Then we take 4 actions (U,U,U,U) and then we are at (12,9). So H=4, and the sequence is for turns 8,9,10,11.\n\n   So in BFS, when we pop a state (t, y, path) and y==9, then we return the path (which has length = t-8).\n\n   But note: we must check that the state (t,9) is safe? Actually, at turn t, we are at y=9 (which is safe) so we can return.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Let Q = deque()\n      We push (8,5, [])   # at turn8, y=5, no actions taken yet.\n\n      visited = set()  # states (t,y) that we have visited.\n\n      while Q:\n          pop state (t, y, path)\n          if (t,y) is not safe: skip   # check safety at (t,y): if y in [1,8] and at turn t, 0 is in one of the car spans on freeway y -> unsafe. Otherwise safe.\n\n          if y==9: then we have the solution: the path is the sequence of actions for turns 8 to t-1. And H = t-8. We output the actions.\n\n          else: \n              for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                  next_y = y + delta (if within [0,9])\n                  next_t = t+1\n                  next_path = path + [action]\n\n                  if (next_t, next_y) not visited: \n                      mark visited and push (next_t, next_y, next_path)\n\n      If we don't find, we may extend the time limit.\n\nBut note: we must check the safety of the current state (t,y) when we pop it? Why not at generation? Because the safety condition depends on t, and if we generate a state (t,y) and then later we pop it, we must check it again? Actually, the safety condition is deterministic and only depends on t and y. So we can check at generation time: when we generate (next_t, next_y) from (t,y) by an action, we can check the safety of (next_t, next_y) at that time? But note: the state (t,y) we are leaving must be safe? We are leaving it to go to the next state. But we already have the state (t,y) and we assume it's safe? Actually, we checked when we popped it? \n\nBut wait: when we push a state (t,y), we haven't checked its safety? We only check when we pop it. That is acceptable because the safety condition is fixed and we are doing BFS by time. However, we might push a state that is unsafe and then later when we pop it we skip. To avoid expanding from unsafe states, we can check at generation: when generating (t+1,y_next) from (t,y), we know that (t,y) is safe (because we popped it and checked) and then we check (t+1,y_next) is safe? Actually, no: the state (t+1,y_next) is the next state and we haven't checked it. \n\nSo we can do:\n\n   When generating a child state (t+1, y_next) from a safe state (t,y) (which we popped and is safe), we compute the child. Then we check if (t+1, y_next) is safe? If not, we skip. Then we push it.\n\nBut note: the state (t,y) is safe, but the state (t+1,y_next) might be unsafe. We avoid pushing unsafe states.\n\nAlternatively, we can check at the time of popping. Since we are doing BFS by time, we can do:\n\n   Start by pushing (8,5,[]) and mark visited (8,5).\n\n   Then when we pop (8,5,[]): \n        check safety: safe? yes -> then for each action:\n            next_t=9, next_y = 5 (if S) or 6 (if U) or 4 (if D)\n\n            For each next state, we check if it is safe? \n                for (9,5): check freeway5 at turn9: \n                    freeway5: left-moving car: (-60,-25,left,36)\n                    at turn9: elapsed=1 -> head_t = -60 - 36*1 = -96, tail_t = -25 -36*1 = -61.\n                    span = [-96, -61]. 0 not in this? -> safe? yes.\n\n                for (9,6): freeway6 at turn9: \n                    freeway6: right-moving car: (-20,-31,right,4) -> actually, the car is (head_0=-20, tail_0=-31, right,4)\n                    at turn9: elapsed=1 -> tail_t = -31 + 4*1 = -27, head_t = -20+4*1 = -16.\n                    span = [-27, -16]. 0 not in this? -> safe.\n\n                for (9,4): freeway4 at turn9: \n                    freeway4: car (-27,-38,right,3) -> at turn9: \n                         tail_t = -38 + 3*1 = -35, head_t = -27+3*1 = -24.\n                    span = [-35, -24]. 0 not in -> safe.\n\n            So we push all three: (9,5,['S']), (9,6,['U']), (9,4,['D'])\n\n   Then we pop the next states.\n\nWe continue until we find a state (t,9) for some t.\n\nWe must avoid infinite loops: we set a time limit? The minimal H is at least 4 (if we go up 4 times). But we might have to wait, so we can set a limit, say up to 20 turns.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving, and the positions are linear in time. The freeway conditions might be periodic? But the speeds are constant and the segments are long? Actually, we don't need to worry about periodicity because we are only going to a limited time.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at a few turns to see the patterns.\n\nWe are going to simulate until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS until we find a solution.\n\nBut note: the state space is (t,y) for t in [8, 8+limit] and y in [0,9]. We can set limit=20, so 20*10=200 states.\n\nWe'll code accordingly.\n\nNow, we write the safety check function:\n\ndef is_safe(t, y):\n    # t: absolute turn, y: current y at the beginning of turn t.\n    if y==0 or y==9:\n        return True\n    # elapsed time from t1=8\n    elapsed = t - 8\n    if y==1:\n        # freeway1: one car: (96,49,right,48)\n        tail_t = 49 + 48 * elapsed\n        head_t = 96 + 48 * elapsed\n        if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y==2:\n        # two cars\n        # car1: (36,25,right,12)\n        tail1_t = 25 + 12 * elapsed\n        head1_t = 36 + 12 * elapsed\n        # car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> tail_0=-47, head_0=-36\n        tail2_t = -47 + 12 * elapsed\n        head2_t = -36 + 12 * elapsed\n        if (tail1_t <= 0 <= head1_t) or (tail2_t <= 0 <= head2_t):\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y==3:\n        # car: (-27,-38,right,3) -> tail_0=-38, head_0=-27\n        tail_t = -38 + 3 * elapsed\n        head_t = -27 + 3 * elapsed\n        if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y==4:\n        # same as y=3\n        tail_t = -38 + 3 * elapsed\n        head_t = -27 + 3 * elapsed\n        if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y==5:\n        # car: (-60,-25,left,36) -> head_0=-60, tail_0=-25\n        head_t = -60 - 36 * elapsed\n        tail_t = -25 - 36 * elapsed\n        # note: the span is [head_t, tail_t] and we require head_t <= 0 <= tail_t\n        if head_t <= 0 <= tail_t:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y==6:\n        # car: (-20,-31,right,4) -> tail_0=-31, head_0=-20\n        tail_t = -31 + 4 * elapsed\n        head_t = -20 + 4 * elapsed\n        if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y==7:\n        # same as y=6\n        tail_t = -31 + 4 * elapsed\n        head_t = -20 + 4 * elapsed\n        if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y==8:\n        # same as y=6\n        tail_t = -31 + 4 * elapsed\n        head_t = -20 + 4 * elapsed\n        if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n\nBut note: for freeway5 (left-moving) we have head_t and tail_t computed as head_0 - s*elapsed and tail_0 - s*elapsed, and then we check head_t <= 0 <= tail_t? \n\nIn the example at t=8: head_t=-60, tail_t=-25 -> head_t=-60<=0 is true, but 0<=tail_t=-25 is false -> so safe.\n\nAt t=9: head_t=-60-36=-96, tail_t=-25-36=-61 -> then head_t=-96<=0 is true, 0<=tail_t=-61 is false -> safe.\n\nAt t=10: head_t=-60-36*2=-132, tail_t=-25-36*2=-97 -> safe.\n\nBut what if at some turn the car covers 0? \n\nWe can compute: \n   For freeway5: we require head_t <= 0 <= tail_t -> \n      -60 -36*elapsed <= 0 and 0<= -25 -36*elapsed -> \n      The second condition: 0<= -25 -36*elapsed -> which is never true because -25-36*elapsed is negative. So freeway5 is always safe? \n\nSimilarly, freeway1: the car is at 49+48*elapsed to 96+48*elapsed. At elapsed=0: [49,96] -> 0 not in. As time increases, the car moves right, so it will never cover 0? \n\nFreeway2: \n   car1: [25+12*elapsed, 36+12*elapsed] -> at elapsed=0: [25,36] -> safe. As time increases, moves right -> safe.\n   car2: [-47+12*elapsed, -36+12*elapsed] -> at elapsed=0: [-47,-36] -> safe. \n        When will it cover 0? \n            -47+12*elapsed <= 0 <= -36+12*elapsed -> \n            For the lower bound: -47+12*elapsed <=0 -> elapsed<=47/12 ~ 3.9 -> elapsed=4: -47+48=1 -> then at elapsed=4: [1, 12] -> then 0 is not in [1,12]? \n            Actually at elapsed=4: tail_t = -47+12*4 = -47+48=1, head_t=-36+48=12. So 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        At elapsed=3: tail_t=-47+36=-11, head_t=-36+36=0 -> then 0 is in [-11,0]? -> yes! So at elapsed=3 (turn t=8+3=11), the car2 on freeway2 has span [-11,0]. Then 0 is in the span? -> collision.\n\n        Actually: the condition is tail_t <= 0 <= head_t -> at elapsed=3: tail_t=-11<=0 and 0<=head_t=0 -> true. So at turn t=11, freeway2 car2 covers 0.\n\nFreeway3: \n   tail_t = -38+3*elapsed, head_t=-27+3*elapsed.\n   When does it cover 0?\n        -38+3*elapsed <=0<=-27+3*elapsed\n        Solve: \n            -38+3*elapsed<=0 -> elapsed>=38/3 ~12.66 -> at least 13.\n            and 0<=-27+3*elapsed -> elapsed>=9.\n        So at elapsed=13: tail_t=-38+39=1, head_t=-27+39=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> no.\n        elapsed=12: tail_t=-38+36=-2, head_t=-27+36=9 -> then -2<=0<=9 -> yes! So at elapsed=12 (turn t=8+12=20), freeway3 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 same as freeway3: at turn20, unsafe.\n\nFreeway6,7,8: \n   tail_t=-31+4*elapsed, head_t=-20+4*elapsed.\n   Cover 0 when: \n        -31+4*elapsed<=0<=-20+4*elapsed\n        -31+4*elapsed<=0 -> elapsed>=31/4=7.75 -> at least 8\n        0<=-20+4*elapsed -> elapsed>=5\n        So at elapsed=8: tail_t=-31+32=1, head_t=-20+32=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> no.\n        elapsed=7: tail_t=-31+28=-3, head_t=-20+28=8 -> then -3<=0<=8 -> yes. So at elapsed=7 (turn t=8+7=15), freeway6,7,8 cover 0.\n\nSo unsafe turns for freeways:\n\nfreeway2: at turn 8+3=11 (elapsed=3) -> unsafe for freeway2.\nfreeway3 and 4: at turn 8+12=20 (elapsed=12) -> unsafe.\nfreeway6,7,8: at turn 8+7=15 (elapsed=7) -> unsafe.\n\nBut note: these freeways are unsafe only at those specific turns? Actually, they are unsafe for a range? \n\nFor freeway2 car2: \n   at elapsed=3: [-11,0] -> covers 0? yes.\n   at elapsed=4: [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n   at elapsed=2: [-47+24=-23, -36+24=-12] -> doesn't cover 0? because 0 not in [-23,-12] (negative) -> no.\n\nSo freeway2 is unsafe only at elapsed=3? \n\nSimilarly, freeway6: unsafe at elapsed=7: [-3,8] -> covers 0.\n   at elapsed=6: [-31+24=-7, -20+24=4] -> covers 0? -7<=0<=4 -> yes! \n   at elapsed=5: [-31+20=-11, -20+20=0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> yes.\n\nSo actually, freeway6 is unsafe for elapsed>=5? \n\nFor freeway6: \n   We require tail_t <=0<=head_t -> \n        tail_t = -31+4*elapsed <=0 -> elapsed>= ceil(31/4)=8? -> wait: 31/4=7.75 -> so at elapsed=8, tail_t=1 -> then condition fails? \n        But note: at elapsed=5: tail_t=-31+20=-11, head_t=-20+20=0 -> then -11<=0<=0 -> true? \n        at elapsed=6: tail_t=-31+24=-7, head_t=-20+24=4 -> true.\n        at elapsed=7: tail_t=-31+28=-3, head_t=-20+28=8 -> true.\n        at elapsed=8: tail_t=1, head_t=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> false.\n\nSo freeway6 is unsafe for elapsed=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: \n   We require tail_t<=0<=head_t -> \n        tail_t = -38+3*elapsed, head_t=-27+3*elapsed.\n        At elapsed=12: tail_t=-38+36=-2, head_t=-27+36=9 -> -2<=0<=9 -> true.\n        At elapsed=13: tail_t=-38+39=1, head_t=12 -> false.\n        At elapsed=11: tail_t=-38+33=-5, head_t=-27+33=6 -> true.\n\n        How long? \n            tail_t<=0: -38+3*elapsed<=0 -> elapsed>=38/3≈12.66 -> so elapsed>=13? but wait, at elapsed=12 we have tail_t=-2<=0 -> so condition holds until head_t>=0? \n            Actually, condition fails when head_t<0? but head_t=-27+3*elapsed, which becomes nonnegative at elapsed>=9? \n\n        Actually, we require both:\n            tail_t<=0 -> -38+3*elapsed<=0 -> elapsed<= ceil(38/3)=13? but note: we want the condition to hold for 0 in [tail_t, head_t]. \n            We require tail_t<=0 and head_t>=0.\n\n        So:\n            head_t>=0 -> -27+3*elapsed>=0 -> elapsed>=9.\n            tail_t<=0 -> -38+3*elapsed<=0 -> elapsed<=38/3≈12.66 -> so elapsed from 9 to 12 inclusive.\n\n        Therefore, freeway3 and 4 are unsafe for elapsed=9,10,11,12 (turns 17,18,19,20).\n\nFreeway2 car2: \n        tail_t<=0: -47+12*elapsed<=0 -> elapsed>=47/12≈3.91 -> so elapsed>=4 -> but wait, at elapsed=3: tail_t=-47+36=-11<=0 -> true.\n        head_t>=0: -36+12*elapsed>=0 -> elapsed>=3.\n        So both true for elapsed>= ceil(36/12)=3? \n        At elapsed=3: head_t=0 -> so 0 is included? yes.\n        At elapsed=4: tail_t=1>0 -> so condition fails.\n\n        So only at elapsed=3: turn 8+3=11.\n\nBut wait: at elapsed=3: tail_t=-11, head_t=0 -> then 0 is in [-11,0] -> yes.\n   at elapsed=4: tail_t=1, head_t=12 -> 0 not in.\n\n        Therefore, only at elapsed=3 (turn11) for freeway2.\n\nBut note: freeway2 has two cars. The first car: \n        [25+12*elapsed, 36+12*elapsed] -> always positive? so never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway2 is unsafe only at turn11.\n\nNow, let's try to go from y=5 to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nThe minimal moves: 4 Ups: \n   Actions: U,U,U,U -> then at turn12, we are at y=9.\n\n   We need to check the safety at each state we are in:\n\n        Turn8: at y=5 -> safe (as we saw)\n        Turn9: at y=6 -> freeway6: elapsed=1 -> tail_t=-31+4=-27, head_t=-20+4=-16 -> [-27,-16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        Turn10: at y=7 -> freeway7: elapsed=2 -> tail_t=-31+8=-23, head_t=-20+8=-12 -> safe.\n        Turn11: at y=8 -> freeway8: elapsed=3 -> tail_t=-31+12=-19, head_t=-20+12=-8 -> safe? \n                But wait: freeway8 at turn11: elapsed=3 -> tail_t=-31+12=-19, head_t=-20+12=-8 -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn12: we are at y=9 -> safe and goal.\n\n   But what about freeway2 at turn11? We are at y=8 (freeway8) at turn11, not freeway2. So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the sequence: \n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n\n   Then at the beginning of turn12, we are at y=9.\n\n   So the actions: \n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n\n   But wait: at turn11 we are taking the last U? Then at the beginning of turn12 we are at y=9.\n\n   The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we want H=4.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n\n   However, we must check if we can do it in less? 4 is the minimal because we need 4 moves up.\n\n   But what if we go up faster? We are already going up every turn.\n\n   Alternatively, we might go up and then down? but that would take more turns.\n\n   So 4 is minimal.\n\n   But wait: what about the freeway conditions? We saw that at turn11, freeway2 is unsafe. But we are at freeway8 at turn11, so we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, we can do it in 4.\n\n   But note: we start at y=5 at turn8. Then after one U: turn9 at y=6. Then turn10 at y=7. Then turn11 at y=8. Then turn12 at y=9.\n\n   The checks:\n\n        turn8: y=5 -> safe (as computed)\n        turn9: y=6 -> safe (elapsed=1: freeway6: [-27,-16] -> safe)\n        turn10: y=7 -> safe (elapsed=2: freeway7: [-23,-12] -> safe)\n        turn11: y=8 -> safe (elapsed=3: freeway8: [-19,-8] -> safe)\n\n   So the plan is safe.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the sequence of 4 U's.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway8 at turn11 (elapsed=3): \n        tail_t = -31 + 4*3 = -31+12 = -19\n        head_t = -20+12 = -8\n        The span is [-19,-8] -> 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\n   And freeway2 at turn11 (elapsed=3): \n        car2: tail_t = -47+12*3 = -47+36=-11, head_t=-36+36=0 -> so [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe. \n        But we are not on freeway2 at turn11, we are on freeway8 -> so no collision.\n\n   So the plan works.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we are to output actions starting at turn t1 (8) for H turns (4 turns).\n\n   So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut wait: what if we try to do it in 3 turns? That's impossible because from 5 to 9 we need 4 moves up.\n\n   Or what if we take a detour? That would take more turns.\n\n   So minimal H=4.\n\n   However, just to be thorough, let's check if we can do it in 4 turns by a different sequence? But we must go up 4 times. The only alternative is to wait (S) at some point, but that would require 5 turns. So 4 is minimal.\n\n   But note: we might avoid a future collision by waiting? But in this case, we don't encounter any collision in the direct path.\n\n   Therefore, the above sequence is optimal.\n\nHowever, the problem has freeway1, but we never go to freeway1? so we don't care.\n\n   We only go through freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\n   So we are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 8, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, consists of four consecutive \"Up\" (U) actions. This sequence ensures the player moves directly upward without encountering any collisions, as verified by checking the car positions on the relevant freeways at each turn.\n\n- At turn 8, the player is at y=5. The car on freeway 5 (y=5) has a span of [-60, -25] at turn 8, which does not include 0, so it is safe.\n- After moving up to y=6 at turn 9, the car on freeway 6 (y=6) has a span of [-27, -16] (elapsed time = 1), which does not include 0.\n- After moving up to y=7 at turn 10, the car on freeway 7 (y=7) has a span of [-23, -12] (elapsed time = 2), which does not include 0.\n- After moving up to y=8 at turn 11, the car on freeway 8 (y=8) has a span of [-19, -8] (elapsed time = 3), which does not include 0.\n- At turn 12, the player reaches y=9, which is the goal and has no cars.\n\nAlthough freeway 2 is unsafe at turn 11 (elapsed time = 3, span [-11, 0]), the player is on freeway 8 at that turn, so no collision occurs. The direct upward path is collision-free and achieves the goal in the minimal 4 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,6). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nNote: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, y_T) and at that turn T, there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving, at turn T we are on freeway y_T. If we move at turn T (changing row), then at turn T we are on row y_T and at turn T+1 we will be on row y_{T+1}. So at turn T, we only check the car on row y_T.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=9. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\nFor left-moving cars: the car moves to the left. The span at time t1 is [h, τ] (and note that since it's left-moving, h should be less than τ? Actually, the description says for left-moving: initial span [h, τ] and then at time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. Similarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? But wait, the description says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the table for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48). \nThis is a right-moving car? Then according to the rule, the initial span at t1=9 is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? But the table says (head, tail) = (-48, -95). So we must interpret: the given tuple is (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the rightmost point) and tail is the leftmost? But the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] and then moves by adding. So for right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? \n\nActually, the update rule for right-moving: \n  initial: [τ, h] meaning from tail to head (left to right) and then it moves right so both increase.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] meaning from head (which is the leftmost) to tail (the rightmost)? But then moving left would decrease both. However, the numbers given for left-moving car on freeway 5: (48,83,left,36) -> if head is 48 and tail is 83, then the car spans from 48 to 83? But then moving left: at time T, it becomes [48 - 36*(T-9), 83 - 36*(T-9)]. So the entire car moves left.\n\nBut note: the problem says for a right-moving car, the initial span is given as (head, tail) but then represented as [τ, h]? Actually, the table gives (head, tail, direction, speed). We must use the update rule accordingly.\n\nLet me clarify the car representation:\n\nFor a car on freeway k at time t1=9, we are given:\n  (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nAnd the update rule:\n\nIf direction is 'right':\n  At time t1, the car's span is [tail, head] (because the rule says: Span(t1)= [τ, h] and the table gives (h, τ) as (head, tail) so head = h, tail = τ -> then the initial span is [τ, h] = [tail, head]. So the car occupies [tail, head] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the rule says Span(t1)= [h, τ] and the table gives (head, tail) as (h, τ). So the car occupies [head, tail] at t1? But wait, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48): \n  tail = -95, head = -48 -> so the car occupies [-95, -48] at t1=9.\n\nFor freeway 5: (48,83,left,36): head=48, tail=83 -> so the car occupies [48,83] at t1=9.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, y) at turn T and there is a car on freeway y at turn T such that 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nSo for a right-moving car at time T (relative to t1=9, so T = 9 + dt, dt>=0):\n  Span(T) = [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt]\n\nFor a left-moving car:\n  Span(T) = [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt]\n\nWe are to avoid any T (from t1=9 onward) such that when the player is at row y at turn T, and for a car on row y, 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nWe start at turn 9 at y=6. We can only move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The grid has rows 0 to 9. We must end at row 9.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H (so the actions are for t from t1=9 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at row 9).\n\nSince we start at row 6 and need to get to row 9, the minimal moves without cars would be 3 moves: U,U,U. But we have to avoid cars on rows 6,7,8 (and also any row we might step on if we move down? but we are going up). However, we might have to wait (stay) to avoid a car.\n\nWe must check for each freeway (row) that we are on at a given turn, whether at that turn there is a car that covers 0.\n\nWe note that at turn T, the player is at row y_T. We are only concerned with the cars on row y_T at that turn T.\n\nWe are given the state at t1=9. We need to simulate the cars for each turn after 9.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 9, and we are at row 6.\n\nWe need to consider the actions for turns 9, 10, 11, ... until we reach row 9.\n\nWe are going to try to find a minimal H. Since the minimal without obstacles is 3, we try H=3, then H=4, etc.\n\nBut note: we might have to go down temporarily? but that would increase H, so probably not optimal. However, we must consider if there is a car that blocks the entire upward path for several turns, we might have to wait or even go down to avoid and then go up. But since we are minimizing H, we should first try to see if we can do it in 3, then 4, etc.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at future turns for the rows we care about: rows 6,7,8 (and possibly 5 if we go down, but we don't want to go down if we can avoid it).\n\nBut note: we start at row 6 at turn 9. Then at turn 9 we are on row 6, so we check row 6 at turn 9: is there a car on row 6 that has 0 in its span at turn 9?\n\nLooking at the table, row 6: (-16, -27, right, 4) -> this is a right-moving car? Actually, the table has for row 6: one car: (-16, -27, right, 4). But note the representation: for right-moving, initial span at t1=9 is [tail, head] = [-27, -16]. So the car covers [-27, -16] at turn 9. 0 is not in this interval? because -27 to -16 is all negative. So at turn 9, row 6 is safe.\n\nBut wait, the table for row 6: only one car? Actually, the table says for row 2: two cars, but for row 6: only one.\n\nNow, we must simulate for future turns.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement of the cars for each row we might be on at each future turn.\n\nWe are going to consider the actions. The player's moves:\n\nAt turn 9: we choose an action a_9 (U, D, S). Then we move to y_{10} = y_9 + Delta.\n\nWe are at y_9=6.\n\nWe need to check for each turn the row we are on at that turn.\n\nLet me list the rows and the cars on them at turn 9:\n\nRow 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> span at 9: [-95, -48] (because right-moving: [tail, head] = [-95, -48])\nRow 2: two cars: (48,37,right,12) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? but for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? But 48>37, so that's okay. So car1: [37,48] at turn9? and the other car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35,-24] at turn9? \nBut wait: the table says: \"Cars (head, tail, direction, speed)\" and then for row2: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12). So two cars on row2.\n\nSimilarly, row3: (-24,-35,right,3) -> [-35,-24] at turn9? \nrow4: same as row3? (-24,-35,right,3) -> [-35,-24] at turn9?\nrow5: (48,83,left,36) -> left-moving: [head, tail] = [48,83] at turn9? \nrow6: (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27,-16] at turn9?\nrow7: same as row6? (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27,-16] at turn9?\nrow8: same? (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27,-16] at turn9?\n\nNow, we are at row6 at turn9. We are safe at turn9 on row6.\n\nNow, we want to go to row9. We must pass through row7 and row8.\n\nLet me compute for each row (6,7,8) and for a few turns (starting at turn9 and beyond) when the car on that row covers 0.\n\nWe note that a car covers 0 at time T if for that car:\n\nIf it is right-moving: \n  0 is in [tail + s*(T-9), head + s*(T-9)] \n  => tail + s*(T-9) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-9)\n\nIf left-moving:\n  0 is in [head - s*(T-9), tail - s*(T-9)]\n  => head - s*(T-9) <= 0 <= tail - s*(T-9)\n\nBut note: for left-moving, the span is [head - s*(T-9), tail - s*(T-9)] and since head <= tail (because at turn9, the car spans from head to tail and we assume head<=tail for left-moving? Actually, for freeway5: head=48, tail=83, so 48<=83, so the interval is [48,83] at turn9. Then moving left, at time T: [48-36*(T-9), 83-36*(T-9)]. This interval moves left. So 0 will be in the interval when:\n  48 - 36*(T-9) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-9)\n\nBut note: the interval [a,b] contains 0 if a<=0 and b>=0.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nLet me compute for each row the times when 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nRow 1: one car: right-moving, tail=-95, head=-48, s=48.\n  Condition: tail + s*(T-9) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-9)\n  => -95 + 48*(T-9) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-9)\n\n  Solve the inequalities:\n\n  First: -95 + 48*(T-9) <= 0 \n      => 48*(T-9) <= 95\n      => T-9 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n      => T <= 10.979 -> so T<=10 (since T integer) -> T=10 and below? but we start at T=9.\n\n  Second: 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-9)\n      => 48 <= 48*(T-9)\n      => 1 <= T-9\n      => T>=10\n\n  So both conditions: T>=10 and T<=10.979 -> only T=10.\n\n  So at T=10, row1 has a car that covers 0.\n\nRow2: two cars.\n\n  First car: (head=48, tail=37, right, s=12) -> wait, this is given as (head, tail). For right-moving, we use [tail, head] = [37,48] at T=9.\n  Condition for this car:\n      37 + 12*(T-9) <= 0 <= 48 + 12*(T-9)\n\n  First inequality: 37 + 12*(T-9) <=0 -> 12*(T-9) <= -37 -> T-9 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> never true (since T>=9). So this car never covers 0? because the entire car is positive and moving right, so it will never cover 0.\n\n  Second car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, s=12) -> [tail, head] = [-35, -24] at T=9.\n  Condition: \n      -35 + 12*(T-9) <= 0 <= -24 + 12*(T-9)\n\n  First: -35 + 12*(T-9) <=0 -> 12*(T-9) <=35 -> T-9<=35/12≈2.916 -> T<=11.916 -> T=9,10,11\n  Second: 0<= -24 + 12*(T-9) -> 12*(T-9)>=24 -> T-9>=2 -> T>=11\n\n  So both: T>=11 and T<=11.916 -> T=11.\n\n  Therefore, row2 has a car covering 0 at T=11.\n\nRow3: one car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, s=3) -> [tail, head] = [-35,-24] at T=9.\n  Condition: \n      -35 + 3*(T-9) <=0 <= -24 + 3*(T-9)\n\n  First: -35+3*(T-9)<=0 -> 3*(T-9)<=35 -> T-9<=35/3≈11.666 -> T<=20 (but we only care about near future)\n  Second: 0<=-24+3*(T-9) -> 3*(T-9)>=24 -> T-9>=8 -> T>=17\n\n  So the car covers 0 from T=17 to T=20 (and beyond? but at T=21: head = -24+3*12=12, tail=-35+36=1 -> still covers [1,12] at T=21? then 0 not covered? Actually, at T=17: tail=-35+3*8=-35+24=-11, head=-24+24=0 -> covers [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n  But note: the condition is tail <= 0 <= head? at T=17: tail=-11, head=0 -> 0 is included? yes, because head=0. So T=17: covers [-11,0] -> 0 is the right endpoint.\n  At T=18: tail=-35+3*9=-8, head=-24+27=3 -> [ -8,3] -> 0 is included.\n\n  Actually, the condition is: the interval [a,b] contains 0 if a<=0 and b>=0.\n\n  At T=17: a=-11, b=0 -> -11<=0 and 0>=0 -> yes, 0 is included.\n  At T=18: a=-8, b=3 -> yes.\n\n  How long? Until the tail becomes positive? \n      tail = -35 + 3*(T-9) > 0 -> 3*(T-9)>35 -> T-9>11.666 -> T>=21 -> then tail at T=21: -35+3*12=-35+36=1>0 -> so then the car is at [1, 3] at T=21? and doesn't cover 0.\n\n  So row3: 0 is covered for T from 17 to 20.\n\n  But note: we are going to try to get to row9 in minimal turns (like 3 or 4), so T=17 is far away. So we might not need to worry about row3 for a minimal path.\n\nRow4: same as row3? same car description: (-24,-35,right,3) -> same as row3. So row4: 0 covered at T=17,18,19,20.\n\nRow5: left-moving: head=48, tail=83, s=36.\n  Condition: head - s*(T-9) <=0 <= tail - s*(T-9)\n  => 48 - 36*(T-9) <=0 and 0<=83-36*(T-9)\n\n  First: 48 - 36*(T-9)<=0 -> 36*(T-9)>=48 -> T-9>=48/36=4/3≈1.333 -> T>=10.333 -> T>=11\n  Second: 0<=83-36*(T-9) -> 36*(T-9)<=83 -> T-9<=83/36≈2.305 -> T<=11.305 -> T<=11\n\n  So both: T>=11 and T<=11 -> T=11.\n\n  Therefore, row5: 0 is covered at T=11.\n\nRow6: car: (head=-16, tail=-27, right, s=4) -> [tail,head] = [-27,-16] at T=9.\n  Condition: \n      -27+4*(T-9) <=0 <= -16+4*(T-9)\n\n  First: -27+4*(T-9)<=0 -> 4*(T-9)<=27 -> T-9<=27/4=6.75 -> T<=15.75 -> T=9,...,15\n  Second: 0<=-16+4*(T-9) -> 4*(T-9)>=16 -> T-9>=4 -> T>=13\n\n  So both: T>=13 and T<=15 -> T=13,14,15.\n\n  Therefore, row6: 0 is covered at T=13,14,15.\n\nRow7: same as row6? the table says: (-16,-27,right,4) -> same as row6. So row7: 0 covered at T=13,14,15.\n\nRow8: same as row6: (-16,-27,right,4) -> same. So row8: 0 covered at T=13,14,15.\n\nNow, we are at turn9 at row6. We are safe at row6 at turn9 (since T=9 is not in [13,15]).\n\nWe want to get to row9. We can do:\n\nOption 1: Go up at every step: U,U,U: \n  Turn9: at row6 -> safe (as we saw)\n  Turn10: we choose U -> then at turn10 we are at row7.\n      We must check row7 at turn10: is it safe? \n          row7: we computed that it is unsafe at T=13,14,15. At T=10: \n          For row7 car: at T=10: \n             tail = -27 + 4*(10-9) = -27+4 = -23\n             head = -16 + 4 = -12\n          So the car is at [-23,-12] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\n  Turn11: we choose U -> then at turn11 we are at row8.\n      Check row8 at turn11: \n          tail = -27 + 4*(11-9) = -27+8 = -19\n          head = -16+8 = -8\n          -> [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n  Turn12: we choose U -> then at turn12 we are at row9. But we need to check row8 at turn11? \n      Actually, at turn11 we were at row8, and we moved to row9 at turn12. So at turn12 we are at row9.\n\n  But note: row9 has no car? because the freeways are from 1 to 8. So row9 is safe.\n\n  So we are done in 3 moves? \n\n  The actions: \n      Turn9: U (from row6 to row7 at turn10)\n      Turn10: U (from row7 to row8 at turn11)\n      Turn11: U (from row8 to row9 at turn12)\n\n  But wait, we have to check the rows we are on at each turn:\n\n      Turn9: row6 -> safe (T=9: row6 car at [-27,-16] -> safe)\n      Turn10: row7 -> safe (T=10: row7 car at [-23,-12] -> safe)\n      Turn11: row8 -> safe (T=11: row8 car at [-19,-8] -> safe)\n      Turn12: row9 -> no car, safe.\n\n  So H=3? \n\n  But wait, we must also check if we are safe at the rows we are on at the moment. And we are.\n\n  However, note that at turn11 we are at row8 and we are safe. Then we move to row9 at turn12.\n\n  But what about row5? We computed that row5 is unsafe at T=11. But we are never on row5 at any turn. Similarly, row1 is unsafe at T=10, but we are not on row1.\n\n  So the sequence: \n      Turn9: U\n      Turn10: U\n      Turn11: U\n\n  Then at turn12 we are at row9. So we have taken 3 actions (H=3) and reached at turn12 (which is turn9+3) at row9.\n\n  But the problem asks for the sequence of actions from t1=9 to t1+H-1. So we have actions at turn9, turn10, turn11 -> H=3.\n\n  However, note: the player position after H actions: \n      Start: turn9: (0,6)\n      After action at turn9: at turn10: (0,7)\n      After action at turn10: at turn11: (0,8)\n      After action at turn11: at turn12: (0,9)\n\n  So we are at row9 at turn12, which is after 3 actions.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n\n  But wait, the answer format: \n      Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n      Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n      ...\n\n  So we have three turns: 9, 10, 11.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: is there any car that we might have missed? \n\n  Specifically, row2 has a car that is unsafe at T=11. But we are at row8 at T=11, not row2. So it's safe.\n\n  But what about row5? unsafe at T=11: row5 has a left-moving car that covers 0 at T=11. But we are at row8 at T=11, so we are not affected.\n\n  So the sequence is safe.\n\n  However, note that the table for row2 has two cars: one that never covers 0 and one that covers 0 at T=11. But again, we are not on row2 at T=11.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 3.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are only concerned with the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row5: at T=11, it covers 0. But we are at row8 at T=11, so no collision.\n\nHowever, what if we had to go through row5? We don't.\n\nBut note: we start at row6, then go to row7, then row8, then row9. We skip row5.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut wait, what if we did a different move? For example, if we stayed at row6 at turn9, then we would be at row6 at turn10? But we don't need to.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nBut let me check if at turn9 we do something else? We don't need to.\n\nBut wait, what about row3 and row4? They are unsafe at T=17 to 20, but we are done by turn12.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 3 and the actions are U, U, U.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1. So H=3.\n\nBut wait: the player update: we take an action at turn t and then at turn t+1 we are at the new position. So after H actions, we are at turn t1+H. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo at the end of the sequence (after H actions), the player is at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: \n  At turn t1 (9): we are at y0 = 6.\n  After first action (at turn9): at turn10, y1 = y0 + Delta.\n  After second action (at turn10): at turn11, y2 = y1 + Delta.\n  After third action (at turn11): at turn12, y3 = y2 + Delta.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHere, t1=9, H=3, so t1+H-1 = 9+3-1 = 11. But at turn11 we are at y2 = 8? because we did:\n  turn9: U -> at turn10: 7\n  turn10: U -> at turn11: 8\n  turn11: U -> at turn12: 9\n\nSo at turn11 (t1+H-1=9+3-1=11) we are at 8, not 9.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nWe must be at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we must be at row9 at the turn when we have taken the last action? \n\nBut the state after the last action is at the next turn.\n\nHow does the indexing work?\n\nThe problem states: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nAnd the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (9) at y_{t1}=6.\n\nWe take an action at turn t1 (9) to get y_{10}.\nThen at turn t1+1 (10) we take an action to get y_{11}, and so on.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: after the sequence of H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), we have updated the state H times, so the last state is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis means that at the turn t1+H-1, we are at row9.\n\nBut how do we achieve that? \n\nWe are at turn9: row6.\nWe want at turn9+H-1: row9.\n\nSo we need to move from row6 to row9 in (H-1) steps? because we start at turn9 and then we have H actions: \n  action at turn9 -> turn10: row?\n  ...\n  action at turn9+H-1 -> turn9+H: row?\n\nBut the state at turn9+H-1 is the state after (H-1) actions? \n\nActually, the state at turn t is before taking the action at that turn? \n\nBut the problem says: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then we take action a_T, and then at turn T+1 we are at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nSo at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose a_T, and then we move to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1 (9): y_9=6.\n\nWe take action a_9 -> then at turn10: y_10 = y_9 + Delta(a_9).\n\nWe take action a_{10} -> then at turn11: y_11 = y_10 + Delta(a_10).\n\n...\n\nWe take action a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nSo we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nWe start at turn9: y9=6.\n\nWe need to achieve y_{9+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the number of steps (actions) we take is H, but the state we care about is at turn9+H-1.\n\nThe actions we take are at turns: 9, 10, ..., 9+H-1 (total H actions). After these H actions, we have H state transitions: from turn9 to turn9+1, then to turn9+2, ... to turn9+H.\n\nBut the state at turn9+H-1 is the state after (H-1) actions? \n\nLet me define:\n  After 0 actions: at turn9: y9=6.\n  After 1 action (at turn9): at turn10: y10=6+Delta(a9)\n  After 2 actions: at turn11: y11 = y10 + Delta(a10)\n  ...\n  After k actions: at turn9+k: y_{9+k} = ... \n\nWe require that at turn9+H-1, we are at row9. That is, after (H-1) actions, we are at turn9+(H-1) and we require y_{9+H-1}=9.\n\nBut we are going to take H actions? \n\nThe problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> so t=0,...,H-1, so the actions are at times: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn? and then we take the last action and move to turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (before taking the last action? or after?) the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo it is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 and move to turn t1+H. \n\nBut we don't require anything for turn t1+H.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 must be 9.\n\nBut we start at turn9: state=6.\n\nWe need to get to state=9 at the beginning of turn9+H-1.\n\nThe number of state transitions from turn9 to turn9+H-1 is (H-1) - 9? Actually, from turn9 to turn9+H-1: that's (H-1 - 9 + 1) turns? \n\nWe have:\n\n  Turn9: y9=6\n  Turn10: y10=?\n  ...\n  Turn9+H-1: y_{9+H-1}=9\n\nThe number of transitions from turn9 to turn9+H-1 is (9+H-1 - 9) = H-1 transitions.\n\nSo we need to go from y9=6 to y_{9+H-1}=9 in H-1 moves (each move is an action).\n\nThe minimal number of moves (actions) to go from 6 to 9 is 3 (if we go up three times). So H-1=3 -> H=4.\n\nTherefore, we need H=4, so 4 actions: at turns9,10,11,12.\n\nAnd we want at turn9+4-1 = turn12, we are at row9.\n\nSo we must be at row9 at the beginning of turn12.\n\nHow to achieve that?\n\nWe start at turn9: row6.\n\nWe take 4 actions (at turns9,10,11,12) to get to turn13? But we require at turn12 we are at row9.\n\nActually, the state at turn12 is the state at the beginning of turn12, and then we take an action at turn12 to go to turn13.\n\nBut we require that at turn12 (the beginning) we are at row9.\n\nSo we need to reach row9 by the beginning of turn12.\n\nThe actions we take at turns9,10,11 will determine the state at turn12.\n\nWe have 3 actions (at turns9,10,11) to get from row6 at turn9 to row9 at turn12.\n\nSo we need to go from row6 to row9 in 3 moves: so we must go up every time: U,U,U.\n\nThen:\n  Turn9: action U -> turn10: row7\n  Turn10: action U -> turn11: row8\n  Turn11: action U -> turn12: row9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn12, we are at row9. Then we take an action at turn12? But the problem says the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and H=4, so we have actions at turns9,10,11,12. But we are already at row9 at turn12, so we can choose S (stay) at turn12? \n\nBut note: the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 9+4-1=12) we are at row9. We are. Then we take an action at turn12 (the last action) which can be S. Then we move to turn13: still row9.\n\nBut we don't care about turn13. We only require that at turn12 we are at row9.\n\nSo the actions: \n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: S   (or D? but we don't want to move down, so S)\n\nBut wait, we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on. At turn12, we are at row9. Since there are no cars on row9, it's safe.\n\nBut we also must check the intermediate steps.\n\nWe already checked for the same moves (U,U,U) for the first three actions:\n\n  Turn9: at row6 -> safe (as T=9: row6 car at [-27,-16] -> safe)\n  Turn10: at row7 -> safe (T=10: row7 car at [-23,-12] -> safe)\n  Turn11: at row8 -> safe (T=11: row8 car at [-19,-8] -> safe)\n  Turn12: at row9 -> safe.\n\nBut now we have a fourth action at turn12: we choose S. Then at turn12 we are at row9 and we do nothing. Then at turn13 we remain at row9. But we don't require anything for turn13. However, we must avoid collision at turn12: which we are safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says: we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and then after the last action, the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9. But actually, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1. But that action doesn't change the fact that we were at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4? \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". What is H? It is the number of actions we take. We need to take 4 actions? But we could have done it in 3 actions if we were allowed to be at row9 at turn12 (by taking the last action at turn11). However, the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9. If H=3, then t1+H-1=9+3-1=11, so we must be at row9 at turn11.\n\nBut with 3 actions: \n  We take actions at turn9,10,11. Then the state at turn11 (the beginning of turn11) is the state after the second action? \n\n  After action at turn9: turn10: row7\n  After action at turn10: turn11: row8\n  After action at turn11: turn12: row9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn11, we are at row8. We are not at row9.\n\nTherefore, to be at row9 at the beginning of turn11, we would have to get there in two moves? That is not possible because we start at row6 and the maximum we can move is +1 per move, so at turn11 we can be at row8 (if we do two U's: from6 to7 at turn10, then to8 at turn11) or row9? only if we do two U's and then a third U? but then at turn11 we are at row8.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn11, we need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn11. How?\n\n  Start turn9: row6.\n  Action at turn9: U -> turn10: row7.\n  Action at turn10: U -> turn11: row8? \n  How to be at row9 at turn11? We need to have moved by +3 from turn9 to turn11? that's two moves: so we need to move +1.5 per move? not possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  Turn9: U -> turn10: row7\n  Turn10: U -> turn11: row8\n  Turn11: U -> turn12: row9\n  Turn12: S (or U? but we are at row9, so we can't go up, but we can stay)\n\nBut we must check: at turn12 we are at row9, and then we do S. But we are already at row9 at the beginning of turn12, so we satisfy the condition. Then we take an action at turn12 (S) to stay at row9 for turn13, but we don't care.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: S\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 3 actions? We see that we cannot be at row9 at the beginning of turn11 (which would require H=3: then t1+H-1=9+3-1=11). So H=4.\n\nBut wait, what if we do a double move? No, we can only move +1 per action.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go up faster? but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could do:\n\n  Turn9: U -> row7 at turn10\n  Turn10: U -> row8 at turn11\n  Turn11: U -> row9 at turn12\n\nThen at turn12, we are at row9. But we haven't taken an action at turn12? But the problem requires H actions and then at turn t1+H-1=9+H-1 we are at row9. If we take only 3 actions (H=3), then we require at turn11 we are at row9, which we are not. So we must take a fourth action? \n\nBut the problem says: we take actions for t from 0 to H-1, so H actions. And then at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9.\n\nWith H=4: \n  Actions at turns9,10,11,12.\n  Then at turn t1+H-1 = 9+4-1=12, we are at row9 (at the beginning of turn12).\n\nBut when we start turn12, we are at row9. Then we take the fourth action (at turn12) which is S.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn12 is row9, which satisfies the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: S\n\nBut we must check the safety at turn12? we are at row9: no car -> safe.\n\nAnd we already checked the previous turns.\n\nBut wait, what if we do D or something else? We don't need to.\n\nBut note: at turn12 we are at row9 and we do S. That's safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could do U at turn12? but that would be invalid because we cannot go above 9. The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, then we try to go to 10, which is not allowed. So we must do S.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: S\n\nBut now, we must check if there is a possibility of doing it in less than 4? We saw not.\n\nBut what if we do:\n\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: S  -> then at turn12 we are still at row8? not 9.\n\nOr \n\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U -> then at turn12 we are at row9, but we haven't taken an action at turn12? but we require to be at row9 at turn12 (if H=4) and then we take an action at turn12. But if we only take 3 actions, then H=3 and we require to be at row9 at turn11, which we are not.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, H=4.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at row9 at an earlier turn? \n\nTo be at row9 at turn10: \n  We start at turn9: row6.\n  Action at turn9: we can only move to row7 at turn10. So we are at row7 at turn10.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn11: \n  We start at turn9: row6.\n  Action at turn9: U -> turn10: row7\n  Action at turn10: we can move to row8 at turn11? not row9.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn12: \n  As above: we can do it by three U's: \n        turn9: U -> turn10:7\n        turn10: U -> turn11:8\n        turn11: U -> turn12:9\n\n  Then we are at row9 at the beginning of turn12.\n\n  Then we take the fourth action (at turn12) to stay.\n\nSo that's the minimal.\n\nBut note: we might try to use a down move to avoid a car? but we don't need to because the path is safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". Why is H=4? because we take 4 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at row9 at turn12, which is the turn we require. Then we take an extra action (S) at turn12. But the problem does not require that we stop taking actions after reaching. It requires that we take H actions and that at the turn t1+H-1 we are at row9.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, we could do without the last S? but then we only take 3 actions, and then at turn11 (t1+3-1=11) we are at row8, not 9.\n\nSo we must take 4 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the requirement: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo with H=4: we achieve y_{12}=9.\n\nAnd with H=3: we achieve y_{11}=8, not 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut we must check if there is a possibility that we can reach row9 at turn12 without having to take an action at turn12? but the problem requires H actions. And if we take only 3 actions, then we are not at row9 at turn11. So we must take 4 actions.\n\nBut note: the action at turn12 is necessary to satisfy the sequence length H=4. And we are at row9 at the beginning of turn12, so we can choose S.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut what if we do:\n\n  Turn9: U -> turn10:7\n  Turn10: U -> turn11:8\n  Turn11: U -> turn12:9\n  Turn12: we must take an action -> S.\n\nWe could do D? but that would move us to 8 at turn13, but we are only concerned about being at 9 at turn12.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is U, U, U, S.\n\nBut let me check if there is a sequence that uses 4 moves but avoids a car that might appear? We already checked that the moves are safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? we can't.\n\nOr what if we wait? for example:\n\n  Turn9: S -> then at turn10: still at row6.\n  But at turn10: row6 is safe? \n        row6 at T=10: \n            car: tail=-27+4*(10-9)=-23, head=-16+4=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  Then turn10: U -> turn11: row7.\n        row7 at T=11: \n            tail=-27+4*(11-9)=-19, head=-16+8=-8 -> [-19,-8] -> safe.\n  Then turn11: U -> turn12: row8.\n        row8 at T=12: \n            tail=-27+4*(12-9)=-15, head=-16+12=-4 -> [-15,-4] -> safe.\n  Then turn12: U -> turn13: row9.\n\nBut then we are at row9 at turn13. But we require to be at row9 at turn12 (if H=4 then turn12 is the turn we must be at row9). But in this sequence, at turn12 we are at row8, not 9. So we are not at row9 at turn12.\n\nTherefore, we must use the three U's at the first three moves to be at row9 at turn12.\n\nSo the sequence we have is the only one that gets us to row9 at turn12.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut note: we could also do at turn12: D? but that would move us to 8 at turn13, which is not required and might be dangerous? but we are only required to be at row9 at turn12. After that, we don't care. But the problem says \"avoid collisions\", so we must avoid at every turn we are on. At turn12 we are at row9 (safe). Then we do D: then at turn13 we would be at row8. At turn13, we are at row8: and we must check row8 at T=13: \n    row8 car: tail=-27+4*(13-9)=-27+16=-11, head=-16+16=0 -> [-11,0] -> contains 0? \n        -11<=0<=0 -> yes, so it would collide at turn13? \n\nBut the problem only requires that we avoid collisions during the actions? and we are only concerned until we have taken the last action? \n\nActually, we must avoid collisions at every turn when we are on a freeway. We are on row8 at turn13? and there is a collision? \n\nBut note: the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T at turn T that covers 0.\n\nSo at turn13, if we are at row8, then we are collided.\n\nTherefore, we must not do D at turn12. We must do S.\n\nSo the safe action at turn12 is S.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and a car on that freeway covers the x-coordinate 0 at that turn.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position (Turn 9):** Player is at (0, 6).\n- **Target Position:** Player must be at (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + H - 1\\).\n- **Minimal Moves Without Cars:** To move from y=6 to y=9 requires 3 upward moves (U), but the turn indexing requires being at y=9 at turn \\(9 + H - 1\\). After \\(k\\) actions, the player is at turn \\(9 + k\\). To be at y=9 at turn \\(9 + H - 1\\), the number of state transitions is \\(H - 1\\). The minimal \\(H - 1 = 3\\) (for 3 U moves) gives \\(H = 4\\).\n- **Car Hazards (computed for relevant turns and freeways):**\n  - **Freeway 6 (y=6):** Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 15. At turn 9: car span \\([-27, -16]\\) (safe). At turn 10: \\([-23, -12]\\) (safe).\n  - **Freeway 7 (y=7):** Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 15. At turn 10: \\([-23, -12]\\) (safe). At turn 11: \\([-19, -8]\\) (safe).\n  - **Freeway 8 (y=8):** Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 15. At turn 11: \\([-19, -8]\\) (safe). At turn 12: \\([-15, -4]\\) (safe).\n  - **Freeway 9 (y=9):** No cars (always safe).\n- **Path Feasibility:** The sequence U, U, U over turns 9, 10, 11 results in:\n  - Turn 10: y=7 (safe, as freeway 7 at turn 10 is safe).\n  - Turn 11: y=8 (safe, as freeway 8 at turn 11 is safe).\n  - Turn 12: y=9 (safe, no cars on y=9).\n- **Minimal H:** \\(H = 4\\) actions are required to be at y=9 at turn \\(9 + 4 - 1 = 12\\). The fourth action at turn 12 must be S (stay) since y=9 is the maximum and moving up is invalid. Moving down (D) would lead to a collision at turn 13 on freeway 8 (car span \\([-11, 0]\\) at turn 13 covers 0).\n\n### Sequence of Actions (H=4):\n- **Turn 9:** U (move to y=7 at turn 10; freeway 6 at turn 9 is safe).\n- **Turn 10:** U (move to y=8 at turn 11; freeway 7 at turn 10 is safe).\n- **Turn 11:** U (move to y=9 at turn 12; freeway 8 at turn 11 is safe).\n- **Turn 12:** S (stay at y=9; freeway 9 is safe).\n\nThis sequence achieves y=9 at turn 12 (which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + 4 - 1 = 12\\)) in minimal turns, avoiding all car collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: S\n}",

For each car, we know:\n  freeway k (which is the y-coordinate of the freeway, from 1 to 8)\n  for each car: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nNote: For left-moving cars, the span at time t1 is [h, τ] and for right-moving, [τ, h]. But in the input, the representation is:\n  For a right-moving car: (head, tail, direction, speed) -> note that in the update, for right-moving, the head is the larger end? Actually, the update rule says:\n    Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> meaning τ is the leftmost and h is the rightmost? But the example in the table has for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). \n    Since it's right-moving, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, 0]. Then at time T>t1, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then at T, [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the representation in the table might be (head, tail) regardless of direction? Actually, the update rule specifies how to interpret the span:\n\n  Left-moving: the car is defined by (head, tail) and the span is [h, τ] (if h<=τ then [h,τ] is increasing? But note: for left-moving, the head is the leading part? Actually, the update rule says the car moves left, so the entire car shifts left. The span at time t1 is [h, τ] and then at T, [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\n  Right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h] (so the car goes from τ to h, and then moves right: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48) -> so for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, 0]. Similarly, for freeway 5: (12,47,left,36) -> for left-moving, the span at t1 is [head, tail] = [12,47]? But note: [12,47] is an interval? Actually, the update rule for left-moving uses [h, τ] and then subtracts. So if the car is left-moving, then the head is 12 and tail is 47? That would be a car from 12 to 47? But then when moving left, the entire car moves left.\n\nHowever, note that the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is the freeway of that car) and 0 is in the span of the car at time T.\n\nSo for each freeway, we have one or more cars. The player must avoid being on a freeway y at a turn T when any car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 10 to turn 10+H-1 such that at the last turn, the player is at y=9.\n\nWe start at (0,7) at turn 10.\n\nWe can model the state as (turn, y) and we wish to find the minimal path to (any turn, 9). The turn count starts at 10 and increases.\n\nBut note: the car positions are updated deterministically with time. So for each freeway and each car, we can compute the span at any future turn T.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we are on at a given turn, that for every car on that freeway, 0 is not in the car's span at that turn.\n\nSince we are only moving vertically and the cars are moving horizontally, the only danger is when we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) and at the same turn, a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nWe start at turn 10 at y=7. We are at freeway 7? But note: the player is at (0,7) at turn 10. So we are on freeway 7 at turn 10. We must check the cars on freeway 7 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars? Actually, the table for freeway 7: \n  Freeway 7: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> but wait, the table has two cars on freeway 2? Actually, the table has:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars ... |\n| 1 | (0, -47, right, 48) |\n| 2 | (60,49,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12) -> two cars on freeway 2? \nBut the table has two entries for freeway 2? Actually, the way it's written: \n  \"2 | (60, 49, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12)\" \nso freeway 2 has two cars.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (-21,-32,right,3) -> one car.\nfreeway 4: same as 3? \nfreeway 5: (12,47,left,36) -> one car.\nfreeway 6,7,8: each has (-12,-23,right,4) -> so one car each? But note freeway 6: (-12,-23,right,4), freeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4), freeway 8: (-12,-23,right,4).\n\nSo let's list by freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (0, -47, right, 48) -> right-moving, so at time t1=10: span = [tail, head] = [-47, 0]\nFreeway 2: two cars: \n   car1: (60,49,right,12) -> wait, 60 and 49? But 60>49, so if it's right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [49,60]? But the update rule says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] meaning [tail, head]. So for this car: tail=49, head=60? Then the car is from 49 to 60? Then at time T, the span is [49+12*(T-10), 60+12*(T-10)].\n  car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> tail=-23, head=-12? So span at t1: [-23, -12]. Then at T: [-23+12*(T-10), -12+12*(T-10)].\n\nBut wait, the representation in the table is (head, tail) for the car? Actually, the update rule does not specify the order in the input. The update rule defines the span for left and right. However, the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". \n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point and tail the leftmost? Then the span is [tail, head]. Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost? Then the span is [head, tail] (which would be [leftmost, rightmost] for left-moving? Actually, no: because the update for left-moving says the car moves left, so the head (leftmost) and tail (rightmost) both move left. Then the span [head, tail] becomes [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the input for freeway 5: (12,47,left,36) -> head=12, tail=47. Then the span at t1 is [12,47]. Then at time T: [12-36*(T-10), 47-36*(T-10)].\n\nSimilarly, for the right-moving car on freeway 1: head=0, tail=-47 -> so the car spans from -47 to 0 at t1.\n\nSo we have:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: right-moving, span at t1=10: [tail, head] = [-47,0] -> at time T: [-47 + 48*(T-10), 0 + 48*(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 2: two cars:\n   car1: right-moving, head=60, tail=49 -> span at t1: [49,60] -> at T: [49+12*(T-10), 60+12*(T-10)]\n   car2: right-moving, head=-12, tail=-23 -> span at t1: [-23,-12] -> at T: [-23+12*(T-10), -12+12*(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 3: one car: right-moving, head=-21, tail=-32 -> span at t1: [-32,-21] -> at T: [-32+3*(T-10), -21+3*(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? head=-21, tail=-32, right, speed=3 -> same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: one car: left-moving, head=12, tail=47 -> span at t1: [12,47] -> at T: [12-36*(T-10), 47-36*(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 6: one car: right-moving, head=-12, tail=-23 -> same as freeway2 car2? but speed=4 -> so at t1: [-23,-12] -> at T: [-23+4*(T-10), -12+4*(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway6: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=4 -> so same as freeway6.\n\nFreeway 8: same as above: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=4.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 10 at y=7. We must avoid being on freeway y at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are allowed to move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We can only change by one unit per turn.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We start at 7, so we have to go up at least twice.\n\nBut we must avoid the freeways at dangerous times.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway and for each future turn (starting from turn 10) whether 0 is in the car's span.\n\nWe'll consider turns from 10 to, say, 20 (we can extend if needed) and for each freeway from 1 to 8.\n\nBut note: the player can only be at a freeway if the freeway is between 1 and 8. At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars.\n\nWe are at turn 10 at y=7. We must check freeway 7 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 10: the car is [-23, -12] at T=10? Actually, at T=10: the car is at [-23+4*(0), -12+4*(0)] = [-23,-12]. 0 is not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nNow, we plan the moves.\n\nWe are at y=7 at turn 10. We wish to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal moves would be two ups: so H=2? Then we would be at turn 11: y=8, and turn 12: y=9. But we must check if we are safe.\n\nAt turn 10: we are at y=7 -> safe as above.\n\nAt turn 11: we move to y=8? How? We do an action at turn 10: if we choose U, then at turn 11 we will be at y=8.\n\nBut at turn 11, we are at y=8. We must check freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nFreeway 8: car at T=11: [-23 + 4*(11-10) = -23+4 = -19, -12+4 = -8] -> so [-19, -8]. 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 11 we do U again: then at turn 12 we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n\nBut wait, what about at turn 10: we are at y=7 and we do U, so we are at y=8 at turn 11? Actually, the movement: \n  At turn 10: we are at y=7. We choose U -> then y_{11} = 7+1 = 8.\n  Then at turn 11: we choose U -> y_{12} = 8+1 = 9.\n\nBut at turn 11, we are at y=8. We must check freeway 8 at turn 11: as above, safe.\n\nBut what about freeway 8 at turn 10? We were not on freeway 8 at turn 10, so we don't care. Only at turn 11 when we are on freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12 we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2? But let me check if there is any danger.\n\nWait, what about freeway 7 at turn 10? We were there and safe. Then we left freeway 7 at turn 10 (by moving up to 8) and arrived at freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nBut note: at turn 10 we are at freeway 7, and we moved to freeway 8 at the next turn. So we are safe.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? Let me check the other freeways to see if there is a reason we might have to wait.\n\nBut the plan above is only 2 turns. However, we must check for the entire path.\n\nAlternatively, if we try to go up immediately, we get:\n\nTurn 10: at y=7 -> safe (as above)\nTurn 10 action: U -> then turn 11: y=8\nAt turn 11: we are at y=8 -> check freeway 8: at turn 11, the car on freeway8: \n   T=11: [-23+4*(11-10) = -19, -12+4*(1) = -8] -> [-19,-8] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nThen turn 11 action: U -> turn 12: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n\nBut wait, what if we try to move faster? That's the fastest: two moves.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 10 we can do U? Yes, and then at turn 11 we can do U.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway 8 at turn 10? We are not on freeway 8 at turn 10, so we don't care.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway 6? We are not going through freeway 6. We are at 7 and going to 8 and then 9.\n\nBut what about freeway 7 at turn 10? We were there and safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that at turn T, we are on the freeway y_T. And we are only checked against the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 7 at turn 10: \n  T=10: [-23, -12] -> does not contain 0 -> safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 11: [-19, -8] -> does not contain 0 -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway 8 at a different time? We are going at turn 11. What if we delayed? Then we might hit a car? But we don't need to delay.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at other times? For example, at turn 12: \n   T=12: [-23+4*(12-10)= -23+8=-15, -12+8=-4] -> [-15,-4] -> still safe.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 8 at turn 12 because we moved to 9 at turn 12.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1, so we have two actions: at t1 (turn 10) and at t1+1 (turn 11).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait, the starting turn is t1=10. The sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n  a_{t1+0} = a_10\n  a_{t1+1} = a_11\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then at the end of these actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But note: after the last action, we are at the next turn.\n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t is (x=0, y_t). Then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn 10: we are at y10=7. We choose a10=U -> then y11=8.\nThen at turn 11: we choose a11=U -> then y12=9.\n\nSo at the end of the sequence (which has two actions: at turn10 and turn11), we are at turn12 with y12=9. The last action is at turn11. The sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so H=2: \n  t=0: a_{10}\n  t=1: a_{11}\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait: is it possible that we have to wait? For example, if we were to go to freeway 8 at a time when the car is at 0? But at turn11 the car is at [-19,-8] and at turn12 the car would be at [-15,-4]? Both are negative. When does the car on freeway8 cover 0?\n\nWe need to solve: \n  -23 + 4*(T-10) <= 0 <= -12 + 4*(T-10)\n\nBut note: the car is moving right. The left end is -23+4*(T-10) and the right end is -12+4*(T-10).\n\nWe set:\n  -23 + 4*(T-10) <= 0   => 4*(T-10) <= 23 => T-10 <= 5.75 => T<=15.75 -> so T<=15 (if integer) for the left end condition.\n\n  and \n  0 <= -12 + 4*(T-10)   => 4*(T-10) >= 12 => T-10>=3 => T>=13.\n\nSo for T in [13,15] (inclusive of integers) the car on freeway8 will cover 0. But we are going at turn11, which is before 13 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway7: when would the car cover 0? \n  At turn T: [-23+4*(T-10), -12+4*(T-10)] contains 0?\n  Solve: -23+4*(T-10) <= 0 <= -12+4*(T-10)\n  Left: 4*(T-10) <= 23 -> T-10<=5.75 -> T<=15.75 -> T<=15\n  Right: 0<=-12+4*(T-10) -> 4*(T-10)>=12 -> T-10>=3 -> T>=13.\n\nSo freeway7 is dangerous at T=13,14,15.\n\nBut we are at freeway7 only at turn10 (and we are safe) and then we leave. So we are safe.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway6? We don't in this plan.\n\nSo the minimal plan is 2 moves.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: the initial position is (0,7) at turn10. And we need to get to (0,9). The minimal moves are two ups. And we have verified that the two moves are safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn10: we are not there, but if we were to stay at 8 at turn10 we would be in danger? But we are not.\n\nHowever, what if we had to move at turn10 and we choose to go up, then we are at 8 at turn11. But if we had chosen to stay at 7 at turn10, then we would have been at 7 at turn11? But we don't want to do that because it's slower.\n\nBut in our plan, we go up twice.\n\nBut let me check if there is any constraint that forces us to wait? For example, if we had to go through freeway8 at a dangerous time? But we go at turn11, which is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway6? We are not going through freeway6.\n\nWhat about freeway5? We are not going through it.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway1? We are not going to freeway1.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". H is the number of actions? And we have two actions. Then the last state is at turn12 (after two actions) we are at y=9.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut note: the sequence has two actions: for t=0 (which is turn10) and t=1 (which is turn11). And H=2.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so we have H=2.\n\nBut wait, what if we try to go up only? We are at 7, we need to get to 9: two moves.\n\nBut what if we do a double up? That is the minimal.\n\nBut let me consider if we can do it in one move? No, because we are at 7 and we need to get to 9: one move can only get to 8.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\", meaning the minimal number of actions? Yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the above.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 5, just in case? We are at freeway7 and then 8, and then 9. We never go to freeway5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: we are not going.\n\nBut what about if we had to go through freeway 8? We are going at turn11, which is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at turn10: \n  T=10: [-23, -12] -> safe.\n\nAt turn11: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nAt turn12: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nAt turn13: [-11,0] -> now 0 is included? The span is [-11,0] -> does that include 0? Yes, because it's a closed interval? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\". So at turn13, freeway8 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, turn14: [-7,4] -> includes 0? Yes, because 0 is between -7 and 4.\n\nTurn15: [-3,8] -> includes 0? Yes.\n\nSo we avoid that by going at turn11.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway7: at turn13: [-23+4*3 = -11, -12+12=0] -> [-11,0] -> includes 0? Actually, wait: freeway7 car: at T=13: \n  left end: -23 + 4*(13-10) = -23+12 = -11\n  right end: -12+12=0\n  so [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\nSo at turn13, both freeway7 and freeway8 are dangerous. But we are not there at that time.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut what if we tried to go up at turn10 and then wait at turn11? Then we would be at freeway8 at turn11 and then at turn12 we are still at freeway8? But at turn12 the car is at [-15,-4] -> safe. Then we could go up at turn12 to 9. But that would take 3 moves: U at 10, S at 11, U at 12? That is not minimal.\n\nSo the minimal is two moves.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut note: the answer format: each line is \"Turn t: action\"\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", and H=2, so t=0 and t=1.\n\nThus, we write:\n\nTurn 10: U   (which is a_{10})\nTurn 11: U   (which is a_{11})\n\nBut note: the turn in the answer should be exactly the turn index.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n- At turn 10, the player is at y = 7. The car on freeway 7 at turn 10 has a span of [-23, -12] (right-moving, speed 4). Since 0 is not in [-23, -12], it is safe. The action U (up) is chosen, moving the player to y = 8 at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, the player is at y = 8. The car on freeway 8 at turn 11 has a span of [-19, -8] (right-moving, speed 4). Since 0 is not in [-19, -8], it is safe. The action U (up) is chosen, moving the player to y = 9 at turn 12.\n\nThe sequence of actions takes 2 turns (H = 2) to reach (0, 9) at turn 12. This is minimal, as two upward moves are required to go from y = 7 to y = 9, and the path avoids all car collisions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 10: U (move up to y = 8 at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move up to y = 9 at turn 12)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) on turn t_1 = 11. The goal is to reach (0, 9) with minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The span moves based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So you don't collide with cars on y+1 at turn T; you only check collision for the freeway you're currently on at each turn.\n\nThe player is starting at y=8, and we need to get to y=9. y=9 is the top, and there are no cars there since cars are only on y=1 to 8. So once we reach y=9, we're safe, no collisions possible.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to move up from y=8. However, moving up to y=9 means that at some turn, we perform U when at y=8, so we go to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turns: at turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 = 11, y_{11} = 8.\n\nWe want y_{11 + H - 1} = 9 for some H, meaning after H-1 actions, we're at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions over H turns? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe position at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nTo have y_{t} = 9 at some turn t.\n\nSpecifically, we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t}, the player moves to y_{t_1 + t + 1}.\n\nThe sequence: at time t_1, apply a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 + 1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nThen at time t_1 + 1, apply a_{t_1 + 1}, y_{t_1 + 2} = y_{t_1 + 1} + Δy_{t_1 + 1}, and so on, up to after H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? But the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nIt says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd the actions are from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k} at time t_1 + k, we have y_{t_1 + k + 1}.\n\nSo after the last action at t_1 + H - 1, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1? That seems inconsistent.\n\nTurn t_1 + H - 1 is when we apply action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, and at that turn, position is (0, y_{t_1 + H - 1}).\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H - 1}, we move to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\", meaning that at the turn when we are about to act, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut at that turn, if we are at (0,9), we don't need to act, but we might act to stay or something, but the goal is to be at (0,9), so I think H includes the turns up to when we first reach y=9.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that we start at turn t_1 at position (0,8), and after H turns (including action at t_1), we are at position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's see the answer format: it shows actions from Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, up to some turn, and then at that turn, we should be at (0,9).\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, after the action, we should be at y=9? No.\n\nAt turn t, before any action, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is updated.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and we choose a_t to move to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T = 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1 + H - 1, we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, so that at that turn, we are at (0,9), and we may or may not act, but the sequence includes actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so for H turns, we have H actions.\n\nIf at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9, then we don't need to move further, but we might choose to stay or something, but the position is already 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to get there from y=8 by moving up.\n\nSince we start at y=8, to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut at turn t_1, we are at y=8. If we do nothing, we stay at y=8. To go to y=9, we need to choose U at some turn when at y=8.\n\nThen at the next turn, we are at y=9.\n\nSo, for example, if at turn T, we are at y=8, and we choose U, then at turn T+1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, we are at (0,9), and we have reached the goal.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, if we reach at turn T, then T is the turn number when we are at (0,9).\n\nFor the action sequence, if we start at t_1, and we reach at turn T, then we have actions from t_1 to T-1, because at turn T-1, we choose a_{T-1} to go to y_T =9.\n\nThen the number of actions is from t_1 to T-1, so H = T - t_1 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =8\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, y_{t_1 + k +1} = y_{t_1 + k} + Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe first time y_T =9.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H for some H, meaning that after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nActions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1 lead to y_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, ..., y_{t_1 + H}\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThen the turn when we are at (0,9) is turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read the problem: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 +0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9), but the turn t_1 + H -1 is when we apply the last action.\n\nI think there's confusion in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps \"turn t_1 + H - 1\" is the turn when we are at (0,9), after applying the action at that turn.\n\nLet's look at the answer format: it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\", and after that, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9? But the turn is not listed.\n\nThe position at turn t is before the action, I think.\n\nAssume that at the beginning of turn t, position is (0, y_t), then we choose a_t, then position updates to (0, y_{t+1}) for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at (0, y_t), we choose a_t, and then the state changes for turn t+1.\n\nWe want for some turn T, at the start of turn T, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1 or something.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_T =9 for T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThat means at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor that to happen, the action at turn t_1 + H -2 must have brought us there, or we start there.\n\nBut we start at t_1 with y=8, not 9.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1, it means that for turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but at turn t_1 + H -1, if we are at y=9, we might choose an action, but it's not necessary for reaching, but the sequence includes it.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=8, we can reach y=9 in one move: at turn t_1, choose U, then at turn t_1+1, y=9.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo for H=2, we have actions at t_1 and t_1+1? Let's see.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 (U), y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, we are at (0,9), and we apply action a_{t_1+1}, which could be S to stay, or U or D, but U would go to y=10, which is invalid, so we must stay or go down, but we are at 9, so we can stay.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), so once we are there, we can stop or stay.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=2, we have two actions: a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}.\n\nIf at t_1 we choose U, then at t_1+1 we are at y=9, and at turn t_1+1, we choose a_{t_1+1}, say S to stay at 9.\n\nThen we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+1.\n\nAnd turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +2 -1 = t_1+1, which matches.\n\nIf we choose only one action, H=1, action at t_1 only, then after that, y_{t_1+1} is set, but at turn t_1, we are at y=8, not 9, so we are not at (0,9) at turn t_1.\n\nSo minimal H must be at least 2 for this case.\n\nWith H=2, we can be at (0,9) at turn t_1+1.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions.\n\nThe issue is that to go from y=8 to y=9, we choose U at some turn when at y=8.\n\nBut at that turn, when we are on y=8, we might collide with cars on freeway 8 if 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nAlso, during the move, we are on freeway 8 until we move to 9.\n\nLet's list the car states at turn t_1 =11 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 48, tail 1, direction right, speed 48. But span is given as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince direction right, the car is moving right, so at turn t, the span is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] for t > t_1, but at t_1, it is [τ, h] = [1,48] since right-moving.\n\nThe span update: for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nAt turn t_1=11, for freeway 1: car (48,1,right,48), so at T, span = [1 + 48(T-11), 48 + 48(T-11)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y_T = k and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at T.\n\nFor freeway 1, at any T, span is [1 + 48(T-11), 48 + 48(T-11)] which for T>11, since T-11 >=0, 1 +48* something positive, so min of span is at least 1, so 0 is never in the span, so no collision possible on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 has two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12). Since direction right, the tail is -59, head is -48? Head and tail: typically for right-moving, head is the front, so position higher, but here h=-48, τ=-59, so h > τ since -48 > -59, so it's moving right.\n\nAt t_1=11, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No.\n\nThe notation: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nHere for first car on freeway 2: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12.\n\nSince d=right, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at T, span = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 12(T-11), -48 + 12(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0,-11,right,12), so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, [-11 + 12(T-11), 0 + 12(T-11)] = [12(T-11) -11, 12(T-11)]\n\nCollision on freeway 2 at T if 0 in span of either car.\n\nFor first car: 0 in [-59 +12(T-11), -48 +12(T-11)]?\n\nSet -59 +12(T-11) <= 0 <= -48 +12(T-11)\n\nSince the span is [lower, upper], and it's continuous, I assume integers, but positions are on a grid, so x positions are integers, I think.\n\nThe freeway is a line, x from -inf to inf, I suppose, with cars occupying integer positions? Probably.\n\nSo 0 in [a,b] means a <= 0 <= b.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo for first car on freeway 2: lower = -59 +12(T-11), upper = -48 +12(T-11)\n\n0 in [lower, upper] iff lower <= 0 and upper >= 0.\n\nBut lower <= upper always.\n\nSo lower <= 0 <= upper.\n\nSimilarly for second car.\n\nFirst, lower <= 0: -59 +12(T-11) <= 0 => 12(T-11) <= 59 => T-11 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so T-11 <= 4 since integer, T <= 15\n\nUpper >=0: -48 +12(T-11) >=0 => 12(T-11) >=48 => T-11 >=4, T>=15\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span when lower <=0 and upper >=0, so T-11 <=4 and T-11>=4, so T-11=4, T=15.\n\nAt T=15, lower = -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, upper= -48+48=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt T=15, for this car, 0 is in span.\n\nBut we have two cars.\n\nNow for second car on freeway 2: (0,-11,right,12), at T, span [ -11 +12(T-11), 0 +12(T-11) ] = [12(T-11) -11, 12(T-11)]\n\nLower <=0: 12(T-11) -11 <=0 => 12(T-11) <=11 => T-11 <= 11/12 <1, so T-11 <=0, T<=11\n\nUpper >=0: 12(T-11) >=0, true for T>=11\n\nSo 0 in span when lower <=0 and upper>=0, so 12(T-11) -11 <=0 and 12(T-11) >=0.\n\nFor T=11, lower =12(0)-11=-11 <=0, upper=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt T=11, for this car, span is [ -11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt T>11, lower increases, upper increases.\n\nFor T=11, T-11=0, lower= -11, upper=0, 0 in span.\n\nFor T=12, lower=12(1)-11=1, upper=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for T>12, larger, 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span only at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, t_1=11, so at turn 11, on freeway 2, there is a car with span including 0.\n\nBut turn 11 is the current turn, and player is not on freeway 2 at start, player is on y=8.\n\nFor collision, we care about when player is on that freeway.\n\nBack to freeway 2: at turn T, if player is on y=2, and 0 in some car span.\n\nFrom above, for first car, 0 in span at T=15.\n\nFor second car, 0 in span at T=11.\n\nNow freeway 3: (-18,-29,right,3)\n\nAt T, span [ -29 + 3(T-11), -18 + 3(T-11) ]\n\nLower <=0: -29 +3(T-11) <=0 => 3(T-11) <=29 => T-11 <= 29/3≈9.666, T<=20 or 21? T-11 <=9 since 3*9=27<29, 3*10=30>29, so T-11<=9, T<=20\n\nUpper >=0: -18 +3(T-11) >=0 => 3(T-11) >=18 => T-11>=6, T>=17\n\nSo 0 in span when T>=17 and T<=20, so T=17,18,19,20.\n\nAt T=17: lower= -29+3*6= -29+18=-11, upper= -18+18=0, span [-11,0]\n\nT=18: lower= -29+21= -8, upper= -18+18=0? T-11=7, lower= -29+21= -8, upper= -18+21=3, span [-8,3]\n\n0 in.\n\nT=19: lower= -29+24= -5, upper= -18+24=6\n\nT=20: lower= -29+27= -2, upper= -18+27=9\n\nT=21: lower= -29+30=1, upper= -18+30=12, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? (-18,-29,right,3), identical to freeway 3, so same collision times T=17,18,19,20.\n\nFreeway 5: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? For left-moving, the head is at h, tail at τ, and since left, head has smaller x if moving left.\n\nThe update: left-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere h=-24, τ=11, s=36.\n\nAt T, span [ -24 -36(T-11), 11 -36(T-11) ]\n\nNow, 0 in span iff lower <=0 <= upper.\n\nLower = -24 -36(T-11)\n\nUpper = 11 -36(T-11)\n\nSince moving left, lower decreases, upper decreases.\n\nLower <=0: -24 -36(T-11) <=0 always true for T>=11, since -36(T-11) <=0 and -24<0.\n\n-24 -36(T-11) <=0? -36(T-11) <=24, multiply both side by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-11) >= -24, which is true since T-11>=0.\n\nLower <=0 always for T>=11.\n\nUpper >=0: 11 -36(T-11) >=0 => -36(T-11) >= -11 => multiply by -1, reverse: 36(T-11) <=11 => T-11 <= 11/36 <1, so T-11=0, T=11.\n\nAt T=11, upper=11, lower=-24, span [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nAt T=12, upper=11-36= -25, lower=-24-36= -60, span [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, 0 in span only at T=11.\n\nFreeway 6: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nAt T, span [ -19 +4(T-11), -8 +4(T-11) ]\n\nLower <=0: -19 +4(T-11) <=0 => 4(T-11) <=19 => T-11 <= 19/4=4.75, so T-11<=4, T<=15\n\nUpper >=0: -8 +4(T-11) >=0 => 4(T-11) >=8 => T-11>=2, T>=13\n\nSo 0 in span for T=13,14,15.\n\nT=13: lower= -19 +4*2= -19+8= -11, upper= -8+8=0, span [-11,0]\n\nT=14: lower= -19+12= -7, upper= -8+12=4\n\nT=15: lower= -19+16= -3, upper= -8+16=8\n\nT=16: lower= -19+20=1, upper= -8+20=12, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (-8,-19,right,4), so same T=13,14,15.\n\nFreeway 8: also same, (-8,-19,right,4), T=13,14,15.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t_1=11, y=8.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nBut to go to y=9, we must be at y=8 and choose U.\n\nWhen we choose U at some turn T, at turn T, we are on y=8, so we need to avoid collision on freeway 8 at turn T.\n\nAlso, if we stay or move, we need to avoid collision on whatever freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nSince we start at y=8, and want to go to y=9, the minimal way is to go up immediately at turn 11.\n\nSo action at turn 11: U, then at turn 12, y=9.\n\nNow, check for collision.\n\nAt turn 11, player is at y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, and at turn 11, is 0 in any car span?\n\nFor freeway 8, at T=11, what is the span?\n\nt_1=11, T=11, T-t_1=0.\n\nFor freeway 8, car (-8,-19,right,4), at T=11, span is [τ, h] = [-19, -8] since right-moving at t_1.\n\nAt T=11, T-t_1=0, so span is as given: [-19,-8] for the head and tail, but tail τ=-19, head h=-8, so span from -19 to -8.\n\n0 is not in [-19,-8], since -8 <0? -8 is less than 0, so max is -8 <0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but at turn 11, player is on y=8, so only need to check freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 11, y=8, freeway 8, car span [-19,-8], which is all negative, 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nThen we choose U, so we move to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, we are at y=9, which is the goal, and no cars above y=8, so safe.\n\nBut at turn 12, we are at (0,9), which is after the action at turn 11.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for H=2, we have:\n\nAction at turn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, we need to specify the action for turn 12? But at turn 12, we are already at the goal, so we can choose S to stay, or the sequence might end.\n\nBut H=2 actions: a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}, so a_{11} and a_{12}.\n\na_{11}: U, then at turn 12, position is (0,9), then a_{12} we can choose S to stay.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 =11 +2 -1=12, we are at (0,9), which matches.\n\nIf we only have one action, H=1, only a_{11}, then after that, y_{12} could be 9 if we choose U, but at turn 11, we are at (0,8), not 9, so we are not at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1 =11 +1 -1=11, still at (0,8).\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a collision? At turn 11, when we are on y=8, no collision, as above.\n\nThen we move to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, we are on y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions at turn 11 for freeway 8.\n\nCar: head -8, tail -19, direction right, speed 4.\n\nAt T=11, since t_1=11, T-t_1=0, span is [τ, h] = [-19, -8], so positions from x=-19 to x=-8 inclusive? I assume integers, so x= -19,-18,...,-8.\n\n0 not in, yes.\n\nPlayer at x=0, not in the span.\n\nThen after moving up, at turn 12, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo with H=2, actions: turn 11: U, turn 12: S (to stay at 9).\n\nBut we don't need to specify beyond reaching, but since the sequence has H actions, and we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is turn 12 for H=2.\n\nIn this case, turn t_1 + H -1 =11 +2 -1=12, and at turn 12, position is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in two turns.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot go up immediately?\n\nFor example, if at turn 11, on freeway 8, there was a collision, but there isn't.\n\nEarlier for freeway 8, collision only at T=13,14,15, not at T=11.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but player is not on them at turn 11.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let's double-check if moving up causes any issue.\n\nWhen we move up at turn T from y to y+1, at turn T, we are on y, and we move to y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, we only care about freeway y.\n\nIn this case, at turn 11, on y=8, freeway 8, no collision.\n\nThen at turn 12, on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo it should be safe.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nMaybe the player can go down first to avoid something, but since we are at y=8 and goal is y=9, going down would take more turns, so minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let's see if at turn 11, if we go up, is there any car that might hit, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, when we move to y=9 at turn 12, at turn 11 we are on y=8, so cars on y=9 don't matter, and there are none anyway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2, with actions: turn 11: U, turn 12: S.\n\nBut at turn 12, we are at y=9, and we choose S to stay, but we could choose nothing, but action must be specified.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 12, we need an action, so S is fine.\n\nWe could have only one action, but as above, not possible.\n\nPerhaps H=1 with action at turn 11, but after action, at turn 12, we are at y=9, but at turn 11, we are not at (0,9), so we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=1, turn t_1 + H -1 =11+1-1=11, we are at (0,8), not 9.\n\nSo must have H=2.\n\nSo actions: Turn 11: U, Turn 12: S\n\nBut in the answer, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=11, H=2, so turns 11 and 12.\n\nAction at 11: U, at 12: S.\n\nBut let's confirm if at turn 12, when we choose S, it is fine.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 11, but we start at 8, not 9, so impossible.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,8) at turn 11, so to be at (0,9) at turn 11, impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 at other times? Only at T=13,14,15, not at 11 or 12.\n\nAt turn 12, if we were on freeway 8, but we are not, we move to 9.\n\nBut just to check, at turn 12, for freeway 8, what is the span?\n\nT=12, t_1=11, T-t_1=1.\n\nFor freeway 8 car: right-moving, speed 4, span at T=12: [τ + s(1), h + s(1)] = [-19 +4, -8 +4] = [-15, -4], so positions x=-15 to -4, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem has multiple freeways with cars, but since player is only on y=8 at turn 11 and then y=9, no need to worry about others.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut turn t_1 + H -1 =12, and we have action at 12, which is S.\n\nTo be precise, after action at turn 12, we stay at y=9, but at turn 12, before action, we are at y=9, so we are already at (0,9) at turn 12.\n\nIf we choose U at turn 12, y=10 invalid, so we must choose S or D, but D to 8, not good, so only S.\n\nSo action at turn 12 must be S.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is U at 11, S at 12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? No.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 11 by doing nothing, but we are at 8, not 9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut let's see if for some reason we cannot go up at turn 11, but there is no reason.\n\nMaybe the car on freeway 8 at turn 11 is close, but span [-19,-8], all x<0, so 0 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not relevant.\n\nSo I believe minimal H=2 with the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and we did.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if moving up, but no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 might have issues, but we are at y=8.\n\nSo, final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the \\(y\\)-coordinate by \\(+1\\), \\(-1\\), or \\(0\\) respectively, with \\(y\\) constrained to \\([0, 9]\\).\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- The player starts at \\(y = 8\\) and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, it is safe once reached.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 8\\), the player must choose action U at some turn when at \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn \\(11\\), the player is at \\(y = 8\\). Checking for collision on freeway 8 at turn \\(11\\):\n  - Freeway 8 has a car with head \\(-8\\), tail \\(-19\\), direction right, speed \\(4\\).\n  - At \\(T = 11\\) (since \\(t_1 = 11\\), \\(T - t_1 = 0\\)), the span is \\([\\tau, h] = [-19, -8]\\).\n  - \\(0\\) is not in \\([-19, -8]\\) (as \\(-8 < 0\\)), so no collision occurs.\n- Choosing U at turn \\(11\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(12\\).\n- At turn \\(12\\), the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is the goal and collision-free (no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n- The sequence requires an action at turn \\(12\\) to stay at \\(y = 9\\), so S is chosen.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\):\n- \\(H = 2\\) turns are sufficient to reach (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 2 - 1 = 12\\).\n- With \\(H = 1\\), the player would be at (0, 8) at turn \\(11\\) (not the goal), so \\(H = 2\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn \\(11\\): U (move up from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) at the next turn).\n- Turn \\(12\\): S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached).\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions:\n- At turn \\(11\\), on freeway \\(8\\), no car span includes \\(0\\).\n- At turn \\(12\\), on freeway \\(9\\), no cars exist.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",
