        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at turn T and 0 is within the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only check for collisions on the freeway I'm currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAt turn t, I'm at position (0, y_t). I choose an action a_t which determines y_{t+1}. Then, for the next turn, I'm at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if y_T = k for some k from 1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWhen I move, say from y_t to y_{t+1} at turn t, during turn t, I am on freeway y_t, so I need to avoid collision only on freeway y_t at turn t. When I arrive at y_{t+1} at turn t+1, I'll be on that freeway for collision check at turn t+1.\n\nThe key point is: at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I check if 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf I change freeways, during the turn when I move, I start on y_t and end on y_{t+1}, but the collision is only checked at the beginning of the turn based on where I am, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is my position at turn T.\n\nAlso, from the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I only care about cars on that freeway at turn T. Cars on other freeways don't matter.\n\nWhen I move at turn T, I change position to y_{T+1} for the next turn, but at turn T, I'm still on y_T.\n\nSo, for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the cars move over time. The state is given at turn t_1 = 0.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 0 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nStart at (0,0) at turn 0.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. So I can be at y=0 or y=9 safely.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so at y=0 and y=9, no freeway, so no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, when moving, if I go to y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nNow, the car states are given for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway at turn 0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36.\n\nSince direction is left, it's moving left, so span at turn t: [h - s(t - t1), τ - s(t - t1)] but t1=0, so at turn T, span = [h - sT, τ - sT]\n\nSince direction left, head and tail decrease.\n\nGiven head=48, tail=83? That can't be right because if moving left, head should be less than tail? Let's see the rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1, span is [h, τ], so if direction left, h and τ are positions, with h < τ? But in the example, for freeway 1, head=48, tail=83, both positive, but if moving left, decreasing, so head should be the left end? I think I have confusion about head and tail.\n\nLet's read the car update rules carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] meaning from h to τ, and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, span(t1) is given as [τ, h], which might imply τ < h if moving right.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, [h, τ], so if h < τ, it's from left to right, but moving left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h], if τ < h, moving right, positions increase.\n\nBut in the data, for freeway 1: (48,83, left, 36)\n\n48 and 83, 48 < 83, so if left-moving, at t1=0, span [48,83], so it covers from 48 to 83.\n\nThen at turn T, it will be [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1: (48,83, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-48,-59, right,12), (-12,-23, right,12), (24,13, right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) is [τ, h], so for the first car: τ=-48, h=-59? That seems odd.\n\nτ and h: for right-moving, [τ, h], so if τ < h, it's increasing.\n\nBut here, for (-48,-59, right,12), τ=-48, h=-59, so -48 > -59, so τ > h, which means the span is from h to τ, but with τ > h, so [h, τ] with h < τ, but it's specified as [τ, h] for right-moving, which would be [-48, -59], but -48 > -59, so this is decreasing? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are labeled based on direction.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so for left-moving, if moving left, the smaller x is the head? Let's think.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48,83, left,36), and it's moving left, so at t1, span [48,83], meaning the car is from x=48 to x=83, and since moving left, the head is at 48, tail at 83? But when moving left, the front is at smaller x, so head should be at min x, tail at max x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head at max x, tail at min x.\n\nBut in the notation for update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] with h and τ such that it decreases.\n\nIn freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], decreasing to [48-36T, 83-36T]\n\nFor right-moving, the notation says span(t1) = [τ, h] and it increases.\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: (-48,-59, right,12)\n\nτ=-48, h=-59, so [τ, h] = [-48, -59], but -48 > -59, so this is from -48 to -59, which is decreasing, but it's right-moving, so it should be increasing. I think there's a mistake in the data or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are positions, and for right-moving, head is the front, which is larger x, tail is smaller x.\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, the span is from tail to head, with tail < head.\n\nBut in the notation, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving, so τ should be the tail, h the head, so τ < h.\n\nBut in freeway 3, first car: τ=-48, h=-59, -48 > -59, so τ > h, which is inconsistent.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-12,-23, right,12), -12 > -23.\n\nThird car: (24,13, right,12), 24 > 13.\n\nFor third car, τ=24, h=13, so [τ,h] = [24,13], which is from 24 to 13, decreasing, but it's right-moving, so it should be increasing.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the problem or the data.\n\nPerhaps for right-moving, the span is given as [min, max] or something.\n\nLet's look at freeway 5: (48,37, right,12), here τ=48, h=37, 48>37, so [τ,h] = [48,37], decreasing, but right-moving.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAnother possibility: in the car state, the \"head\" and \"tail\" might be defined such that for left-moving, head is the left end, tail right end; for right-moving, head is the right end, tail left end.\n\nThen for left-moving, span [head, tail] with head < tail.\n\nFor right-moving, span [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: (-48,-59, right,12), so if right-moving, head should be the right end, so h=-59, τ=-48? But -59 < -48, so head is smaller, which is not right.\n\n-59 is less than -48, so if head is -59, tail -48, then for right-moving, the head should be the front, which is larger x, so if x increases to the right, head should be larger.\n\nAssume x-axis increasing to the right.\n\nFor left-moving car, moving left, so front is smaller x, so head is smaller x, tail larger x.\n\nAt t1, span [head, tail] = [small, large], moving to smaller x.\n\nFor right-moving, moving right, front is larger x, so head is larger x, tail smaller x.\n\nAt t1, span [tail, head] = [small, large], moving to larger x.\n\nIn the notation for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for [τ, h] to be increasing, we need τ < h.\n\nBut in freeway 3, first car: (-48,-59, right,12), so τ=-48, h=-59, so τ > h, so [τ, h] = [-48, -59], which is decreasing, but for right-moving, it should be increasing, so this must be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the numbers are swapped.\n\nLet's look at the third car on freeway 3: (24,13, right,12), τ=24, h=13, 24>13, so [24,13], which is from 24 to 13, decreasing, but it should be increasing for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (48,37, right,12), τ=48, h=37, 48>37, [48,37], decreasing.\n\nBut for left-moving cars, like freeway 1: (48,83, left,36), 48<83, [48,83], which is increasing, but moving left, so it should be decreasing over time.\n\nI think there's a consistent issue in the data presentation.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are always defined with head as the position of the head, tail as position of tail, and for left-moving, head is left, for right-moving, head is right.\n\nThen for left-moving, span is [head, tail] with head < tail.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3, first car: head= -48? tail= -59? But -48 > -59, so if head is -48, tail -59, but for right-moving, head should be larger, so head= -48 is larger than tail= -59? -48 > -59, yes, so head= -48, tail= -59, so tail < head, so for right-moving, span [tail, head] = [-59, -48], which is from -59 to -48, increasing.\n\nAh, I see! In the car state, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end, so tail < head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is left end, tail right end, head < tail.\n\nSo for freeway 3, first car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSo tail = -59, head = -48, so at t1=0, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-12, tail=-23? Given (-12,-23, right,12), so head=-12, tail=-23, so tail=-23, head=-12, span [tail, head] = [-23, -12]\n\nThird car: (24,13, right,12), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor left-moving, like freeway 1: head=48, tail=83, so span [head, tail] = [48,83]\n\nNow, back to the car update.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf direction left: [h - sT, τ - sT] since t1=0\n\nIf direction right: [τ + sT, h + sT]  (because [τ + sT, h + sT])\n\nIn general, from t1 to T, delta t = T - t1 = T since t1=0.\n\nSo for each car, at turn T, the span on x-axis.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car on freeway y_T, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=0 at T=0 to y=9 as soon as possible, moving up or down or stay, but since we want min turns, staying might not help, but sometimes to avoid collision, we might need to wait.\n\nBut moving directly up might be fastest, but we have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the critical point is when x=0 is covered by a car span.\n\nFor each freeway, at each turn, I can compute if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nIf not, it's safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut I need to be on the freeway only when I am at that y at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left, speed 36, head=48, tail=83 at T=0, so span at T: [48-36T, 83-36T]\n\nCar covers x=0 when min <=0<=max, so 48-36T <=0 and 0<=83-36T\n\nSince 83-36T >0 for small T, but let's solve.\n\n48-36T <=0 => 36T >=48 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T>=2 since T integer.\n\n0<=83-36T => 36T <=83 => T<=83/36≈2.305, so T<=2.\n\nT>=2 and T<=2, so only at T=2, 48-36*2=48-72=-24<=0, 83-72=11>=0, so 0 in [-24,11]? Span at T: min=48-36T, max=83-36T\n\nAt T=2, min=48-72=-24, max=83-72=11, so 0 between -24 and 11, yes, covered.\n\nAt T=1, min=48-36=12, max=83-36=47, both >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nAt T=3, min=48-108=-60, max=83-108=-25, both <0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo freeway 1: collision only at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so also collision only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) but head=-48, tail=-59, so tail=-59, head=-48, right-moving, so span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 +12T, -48 +12T]\n\nCar covers x=0 when -59+12T <=0 and 0<= -48+12T? No: min <=0<=max.\n\nMin = -59+12T, max = -48+12T\n\nSo -59+12T <=0 and 0 <= -48+12T\n\nFirst: -59+12T <=0 => 12T <=59 => T<=59/12≈4.916, so T<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12T => 12T >=48 => T>=4\n\nSo T>=4 and T<=4, T=4.\n\nAt T=4, min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, so 0<=0, yes covered.\n\nAt T=3, min=-59+36= -23, max=-48+36= -12, both <0\n\nAt T=5, min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, both >0, not covered.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23, so tail=-23, head=-12\n\nSpan at T: [-23+12T, -12+12T]\n\nCover x=0: -23+12T <=0 and 0<= -12+12T\n\nFirst: -23+12T <=0 => 12T<=23 => T<=23/12≈1.916, T<=1\n\nSecond: 0<= -12+12T => 12T>=12 => T>=1\n\nT>=1 and T<=1, T=1.\n\nAt T=1, min=-23+12= -11, max=-12+12=0, covered.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, span [13+12T, 24+12T] since right-moving.\n\nMin=13+12T, max=24+12T\n\nCover x=0: 13+12T <=0? 13+12T >0 for all T, since min at T=0 is 13>0, so never <=0, so 0 never covered by this car. Similarly, max always >0, min always >0, so x=0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, from cars: at T=1, second car covers x=0; at T=4, first car covers x=0. Third car never.\n\nSo unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nSo same as above, unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12), and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37? head=48, tail=37, but for right-moving, head should be larger, tail smaller, so tail=37, head=48, so span [τ + sT, h + sT] = [37+12T, 48+12T]\n\nMin=37+12T >0 for all T, so never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, so tail=-11, head=0\n\nSpan at T: [-11 +12T, 0 +12T] = [-11+12T, 12T]\n\nCover x=0: min <=0<= max, so -11+12T <=0 and 0 <=12T\n\nFirst: -11+12T <=0 => 12T <=11 => T<=11/12<1, so T<=0\n\nSecond: 0<=12T => T>=0\n\nSo at T=0, min=-11, max=0, so 0<=0, covered.\n\nAt T=1, min=-11+12=1, max=12, both>0, not covered.\n\nSo at T=0, covered.\n\nBut at T=0, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so for freeway 5, unsafe only at T=0? But I need to be on freeway 5 at some turn.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on freeway 5, and at that turn, x=0 covered.\n\nAt T=0, covered, but if I am on freeway 5 at T=0, it would be unsafe, but at T=0, I am at y=0, not on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, for other T: at T=1, min=1, max=12, 0 not covered; T=2, min=13, max=24, etc., never covered except T=0.\n\nBut T=0 is the start, I am not on freeway 5, so for freeway 5, it is always safe? Except at T=0, but since I'm not there, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, first car never covers, so freeway 5 is safe at all turns, since only unsafe at T=0, which doesn't affect us.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, cars (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), so same, unsafe only at T=0, but not an issue, so always safe for us.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: different, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=4, span [37+4T, 48+4T], min=37+4T >=37>0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=4, span [-11+4T, 0+4T] = [-11+4T, 4T]\n\nCover x=0: -11+4T <=0 and 0<=4T\n\nFirst: -11+4T <=0 => 4T<=11 => T<=2.75, T<=2\n\nSecond: 0<=4T => T>=0\n\nSo for T=0,1,2.\n\nAt T=0: min=-11, max=0, covered\n\nT=1: min=-7, max=4, -7<=0<=4, covered\n\nT=2: min=-11+8=-3, max=8, -3<=0<=8, covered\n\nT=3: min=-11+12=1, max=12, both>0, not covered\n\nSo unsafe at T=0,1,2.\n\nBut since we start at T=0, y=0, not on freeway 8, so for freeway 8, unsafe when on it at T=1 or T=2.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, when it is unsafe (x=0 covered):\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=1 and T=4\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=1 and T=4\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe only at T=0, but not applicable, so always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=1 and T=2\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 are always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=1,2.\n\nI need to go from y=0 at T=0 to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, I can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nBut since I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and min turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, when I am at a certain y at turn T, if y=k for k=1-8, and T is unsafe for that k, then collision.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nThe path is a sequence of y positions over time.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nT=0: y=0\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the turn index.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nT starts from 0.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAfter action a_T at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nBut y_{T+1} is the position at turn T+1.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we care about y_T and the cars at T.\n\nTo reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H turns, I am at y=9.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_0, at turn 1, y_1, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, I am at y_H.\n\nI want y_H = 9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from T=0 to T=H, with actions at T=0 to T=H-1.\n\nAfter action at T, position at T+1.\n\nSequence: at T=0, y_0=0\n\nChoose a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nChoose a_1, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\nChoose a_{H-1}, then y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1} =9\n\ny_H=9.\n\nThe time at which I am at position is turn index.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T from 0 to H-1, when I am at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and if 1<= y_T <=8, then no car on freeway y_T covering x=0 at turn T.\n\nAt T=H, I am at y_H=9, which is safe.\n\ny_T for T=0 to H.\n\nT=0: y_0=0, safe\n\nT=H: y_H=9, safe\n\nFor T=1 to H-1, if y_T in 1-8, must be safe.\n\nNow, I need min H.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and end at y=9, the minimal H would be 9, if I go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, then after 9 actions, at turn 9, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if I can do this without collision.\n\ny_T = T for T from 0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, safe\n\ny_1=1, at T=1\n\ny_2=2, T=2\n\n...\n\ny_8=8, T=8\n\ny_9=9, safe\n\nNow, for each T, when on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nT=1, y=1, freeway 1\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at T=2, so at T=1, it is safe? From earlier: freeway 1 unsafe only at T=2, so at T=1, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=2, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at T=2, so collision! At T=2, on freeway 2, which is unsafe at T=2.\n\nSo cannot be on y=2 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nIn this path, at T=2, y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nAlso, for example, at T=1, y=1, freeway 1, safe as per above.\n\nBut at T=2, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe.\n\nMoreover, freeway 3 unsafe at T=1 and T=4, etc.\n\nSo for direct up path, problem at T=2.\n\nI need to either not be on y=2 at T=2, or be there at different time.\n\nSince I can move down or stay, I can delay or something.\n\nBut min turns, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the collisions.\n\nList the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=1 and T=4\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=1 and T=4\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=1 and T=2\n\nI need to be at each y from 1 to 8 at some turn, but not at the unsafe times for that freeway.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and end at y=9, I will pass through each y, but not necessarily at consecutive times if I stay or move down.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I should not stay or move down unnecessarily.\n\nThe position changes by at most 1 per turn, so the sequence y_T must change gradually.\n\ny_T+1 = y_T, y_T, or y_T ±1.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, min H=9, with y_T = T.\n\nBut as above, at T=2, y=2, unsafe.\n\nI need to have at T=2, y_T not 2.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=1 at some point or something.\n\nLet me list for each turn, which freeways are unsafe.\n\nTurn T: unsafe freeways\n\nT=0: freeway 5,8? But at T=0, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so no issue. But for freeway, unsafe means if on it at that turn.\n\nBut for planning, we care when we might be on it.\n\nT=1: unsafe freeways: freeway 3,4,8 (since freeway 3 unsafe T=1, freeway 4 T=1, freeway 8 T=1)\n\nAlso freeway 1,2 safe at T=1? Freeway 1 unsafe only T=2, so at T=1 safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 safe at T=1.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 always safe.\n\nT=2: unsafe freeways: 1,2,8 (freeway 1 T=2, freeway 2 T=2, freeway 8 T=2)\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 safe at T=2? Freeway 3 unsafe T=1 and T=4, so at T=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 safe at T=2.\n\nT=3: all freeways safe? Let's see:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only T=2, so T=3 safe\n\nFreeway 2: same, safe\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe T=1,4, so T=3 safe\n\nFreeway 4: same, safe\n\nFreeway 5: safe\n\nFreeway 6: safe\n\nFreeway 7: safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe T=1,2, so T=3 safe\n\nSo at T=3, all freeways safe.\n\nT=4: unsafe freeways: 3 and 4 (since unsafe at T=4)\n\nOthers safe.\n\nT=5 and later: all safe except possibly, but freeway 3 and 4 unsafe only T=4, so after T=4, all safe? Freeway 1 and 2 unsafe only T=2, freeway 8 only T=1,2.\n\nSo for T>=5, all freeways safe.\n\nT=4: freeway 3 and 4 unsafe.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn H.\n\nMin H=9 if possible.\n\nBut with the constraints.\n\nSince at T=2, freeways 1,2,8 are unsafe, I should not be on y=1,2, or 8 at T=2? y=1 is freeway 1, y=2 freeway 2, y=8 freeway 8.\n\nAt T=2, if I am on y=1, freeway 1, unsafe; y=2, freeway 2, unsafe; y=8, freeway 8, unsafe.\n\nBut y=3,4,5,6,7 are safe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=1, unsafe freeways 3,4,8, so if on y=3,4, or 8 at T=1, unsafe.\n\ny=3 freeway 3, y=4 freeway 4, y=8 freeway 8.\n\nAt T=1, y=1,2,5,6,7 safe.\n\nAt T=4, unsafe freeways 3 and 4, so if on y=3 or y=4 at T=4, unsafe.\n\nOther times all safe.\n\nNow, for min H, I can try to go up but avoid the unsafe positions.\n\nFor example, at T=1, I need to be at y=1, which is safe (since freeway 1 safe at T=1), so a_0 = U, y_1=1.\n\nThen at T=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow at T=2, I cannot be at y=2 because unsafe. Options: move down to y=0, but that might delay; or stay at y=1; or move up to y=2, but unsafe, cannot.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at T=2, but y_1=1, at turn T=1, after action a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy.\n\nAt turn T=1, I am at y_1=1.\n\nI choose action a_1.\n\nIf a_1 = S, then y_2 =1, so at turn T=2, I am at y=1.\n\nBut freeway 1 is unsafe at T=2? Freeway 1 unsafe at T=2, and y=1 is freeway 1, so at T=2 on y=1, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if a_1 = D, y_2=0, then at T=2, y=0, safe, but now I am at y=0, which is behind.\n\nIf a_1 = U, y_2=2, unsafe at T=2.\n\nSo at T=1, after being at y=1, I cannot stay or go up, because both lead to unsafe at T=2 if I am on y=1 or y=2.\n\nGo down to y=0, but then I need to come back.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps at T=1, I don't go to y=1 immediately.\n\nBut I started at y=0 T=0.\n\na_0 could be S, so y_1=0, then at T=1, still at y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince freeway 5,6,7 are always safe, I could go to those quickly.\n\nBut I start from y=0.\n\nList possible y_T over time.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical points are T=1,2,4.\n\nAt T=1, I should not be on y=3,4,8\n\nAt T=2, I should not be on y=1,2,8\n\nAt T=4, I should not be on y=3,4\n\nAt other times, all positions are safe.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible except when forced to avoid.\n\nFor example, at T=0, y=0.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=1 at T=1, which is safe.\n\nBut then at T=2, I cannot be at y=1 or y=2.\n\nIf I go down to y=0, then at T=2, y=0, safe, but y=0.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut I lost time.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=2, I can go up to y=1 at T=3, y=2 at T=4, but at T=4, y=2 is safe? Freeway 2 is safe at T=4, since unsafe only T=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=4 is unsafe, but let's see.\n\nAfter y=0 at T=2, I can go up.\n\nT=2: y=0\n\na_2: U, y_3=1 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=1, freeway 1, safe since unsafe only T=2, T=3 safe.\n\na_3: U, y_4=2 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=2, freeway 2, at T=4, safe, since unsafe only T=2.\n\nThen a_4: U, y_5=3 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=3, freeway 3, at T=5, safe, since unsafe only T=1 and T=4.\n\nSimilarly, continue up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nStart: T=0, y=0\n\na_0: ? If I go up, y_1=1 at T=1\n\nBut then at T=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow for a_1: I need to avoid y=1 or y=2 at T=2.\n\nSo I can go down: a_1 = D, then y_2=0 at T=2\n\nT=2: y=0, safe\n\nThen a_2 = U, y_3=1 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=1, safe (freeway 1 safe at T=3)\n\na_3 = U, y_4=2 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=2, freeway 2, safe at T=4\n\na_4 = U, y_5=3 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=3, freeway 3, safe at T=5\n\na_5 = U, y_6=4 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=4, freeway 4, safe at T=6 (unsafe only T=1,4)\n\na_6 = U, y_7=5 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5, always safe\n\na_7 = U, y_8=6 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na_8 = U, y_9=7 at T=9? y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=8, a_10=U, y_11=9.\n\nI reached y=9 at T=11, which is H=11 turns? Let's count actions.\n\nFrom T=0 to T=H, with actions at T=0 to T=H-1.\n\nAt T=0, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, y_1.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H=9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAfter a_0: y_1=1 (T=1)\n\nAfter a_1: y_2=0 (T=2)\n\nAfter a_2: y_3=1 (T=3)\n\nAfter a_3: y_4=2 (T=4)\n\nAfter a_4: y_5=3 (T=5)\n\nAfter a_5: y_6=4 (T=6)\n\nAfter a_6: y_7=5 (T=7)\n\nAfter a_7: y_8=6 (T=8)\n\nAfter a_8: y_9=7 (T=9)\n\nAfter a_9: y_10=8 (T=10)\n\nAfter a_10: y_11=9 (T=11)\n\nSo y_11=9, so H=11 actions.\n\nBut min possible is 9, so this is worse.\n\nI could go up to y=5 or something quickly.\n\nAt T=0, I could stay or go up.\n\nIf I stay at T=0, a_0=S, y_1=0 at T=1.\n\nAt T=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut at T=1, freeways 3,4,8 unsafe, so I should avoid y=3,4,8 at T=1.\n\nSince I am at y=0, I can go to y=1, which is safe at T=1.\n\na_1=U? At T=1, I am at y=0, choose a_1.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=1 at T=2.\n\nBut at T=2, y=1 is unsafe, freeway 1 unsafe at T=2.\n\nIf a_1=S, y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf a_1=D, but y=0, D would go to y=-1, but y must be in [0,9], so cannot, y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=0, cannot go down, only S or U.\n\nSimilarly from y=9, cannot go up.\n\nAt T=1, y=0, actions: S or U.\n\nIf U, y_2=1 at T=2, but unsafe.\n\nIf S, y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0, I can go U to y_3=1 at T=3, as before.\n\nBut delayed.\n\nTo save time, I need to be at a safe position at critical turns.\n\nAt T=2, safe positions are y=0,3,4,5,6,7,9 but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=3,4,5,6,7 are safe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly at T=1, safe positions y=0,1,2,5,6,7\n\nAt T=4, safe positions all except y=3 and y=4.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 T=0.\n\nI can go directly to y=7 or something.\n\nBut I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFor example, from T=0, go up to y=1 at T=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, instead of going down, I can go up but to a different y.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, I can go to y=2, but at T=2, y=2 unsafe.\n\nOr stay, but at T=2, y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr go down to y=0.\n\nAll bad.\n\nBut I can go to y=7 quickly? But from y=1, I can only go to y=2 or y=0 or stay, not jump.\n\nSo I need to pass through intermediate ys.\n\nAnother idea: at T=0, I go up to y=1 at T=1.\n\nThen at T=1, I go up to y=2 at T=2, but unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo I must not be at y=2 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, I must not be at y=1 at T=2.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=1 only at T=1, and at T=2 be at different y.\n\nBut from y=1 at T=1, if I go down to y=0 at T=2, or stay at y=1 at T=2, both unsafe at T=2 for freeway 1.\n\nUnless I go to y=0, but y=0 is not freeway, so at T=2, y=0 is safe, but I was at y=1 at T=1.\n\nLet's list the sequence.\n\nSuppose I want to reach y=9 faster.\n\nI can go up to y=5 or 6 which are always safe.\n\nBut I have to go through lower ys.\n\nFor example, at T=0, y=0, a_0=U, y_1=1 at T=1 (safe)\n\nNow at T=1, I am at y=1, I need to choose a_1 such that at T=2, I am not on y=1 or y=2, and not on freeway 8, but since I am at y=1, I can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0: safe at T=2\n\ny=1: unsafe\n\ny=2: unsafe\n\nSo only choice is to go to y=0, a_1=D, y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen from there, as before, slow.\n\nBut at T=2, I am at y=0, I can go up to y=1 at T=3, etc., but it takes time.\n\nSince at T=2, y=3,4,5,6,7 are safe, if I can be at y=3 at T=2, for example.\n\nBut how to get to y=3 by T=2.\n\nFrom T=0, y=0, to T=2, y=3.\n\nBut each turn change by at most 1, so from y=0 to y=3 in two actions: impossible.\n\nIn two actions, max y=2.\n\nAt T=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 <=1\n\nAfter a_1, y_2 <=2\n\nSo at T=2, max y=2.\n\nSimilarly, min y=0.\n\nSo at T=2, possible y=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are unsafe, so only possible y=0 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=1, I can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at T=1, y=0, then at T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from T=2, y=0, I can start going up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=0, min 9 turns, so at T=11, y=11?

From turn 2 to turn 10, the turns are T=2 to T=10, which is 9 positions.\n\nAt T=2, y=0\n\nAfter action at T=2, y_3\n\n...\n\nAfter action at T=9, y_10\n\ny_10=9.\n\nNumber of actions from T=2 to T=9 inclusive? Actions at T=2 to T=9, 8 actions, to go from y_2=0 to y_10=9.\n\ny_10 = y_2 + sum of Δy from T=2 to T=9.\n\n8 actions, each Δy <=1, so max y_10 = 0 + 8 =8, cannot reach 9.\n\nWith 8 actions, max increase 8, from y=0 to y=8.\n\nSo y_10 <=8 if y_2=0.\n\nThen to reach y_10=9, impossible if y_2=0.\n\ny_2=0, after 8 actions, y_10 <= 0 + 8 =8.\n\nBut we need y_10=9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, H cannot be 10; must be at least 11.\n\nSimilarly, if y_2=0, after 9 actions, y_{11} <=9, and we can reach 9.\n\nSo H=11 is indeed minimal.\n\nAnd we have a sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 1, I moved down, but is that necessary?\n\nIn the sequence, a_1=D, from y=1 to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is allowed.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some point, but not better.\n\nAnother sequence: at T=0, a_0=S, y_1=0 at T=1\n\nThen a_1=S, y_2=0 at T=2? But at T=1, I am at y=0, if I do a_1=S, y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen same as before, but I wasted a turn, then y_2=0, then to y=9 at T=11, but y_11=9, with 11 actions, but started with S, so same number or worse? In this case, actions from T=0 to T=10, 11 actions, y_11=9.\n\nBut in the first sequence, also 11 actions.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I moved up and down, but same H.\n\nIn terms of turns, same.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I used a down move, which is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from turn 0 to turn 10.\n\nNow, let's write the actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut from turn 3 to turn 10, all U, which is fine.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut the player position: at turn 0, (0,0)\n\nAfter a0=U, at turn 1, (0,1)\n\nThen a1=D, at turn 2, (0,0)\n\nThen a2=U, turn 3, (0,1)\n\na3=U, turn 4, (0,2)\n\na4=U, turn 5, (0,3)\n\na5=U, turn 6, (0,4)\n\na6=U, turn 7, (0,5)\n\na7=U, turn 8, (0,6)\n\na8=U, turn 9, (0,7)\n\na9=U, turn 10, (0,8)\n\na10=U, turn 11, (0,9)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, collision checks:\n\nAt turn 1: y=1, freeway 1, at T=1, not unsafe, safe.\n\nTurn 2: y=0, no freeway, safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=1, freeway 1, T=3, safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=2, freeway 2, T=4, safe (unsafe only T=2)\n\nTurn 5: y=3, freeway 3, T=5, safe (unsafe T=1,4)\n\nTurn 6: y=4, freeway 4, T=6, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\netc.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the down move by staying at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at T=0, a0=S, y1=0 at T=1\n\nThen at T=1, a1=U, y2=1 at T=2, but at T=2, y=1, freeway 1, unsafe at T=2, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\na0=S, y1=0 T=1\n\na1=S, y2=0 T=2\n\nThen a2=U, y3=1 T=3, same as before but I have an extra S at the beginning, so y3=1 at T=3, then to y9=7 at T=9, a9=U y10=8, a10=U y11=9, same H=11.\n\nBut I used S instead of D, but same number of actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, with D, I have one down, but H same.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, I think I have it.\n\nFreeway 8: at T=10, y=8, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. The sequence of actions must ensure that at each turn, if the player is on a freeway (i.e., \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)), no car on that freeway covers the position \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Summary of Unsafe Freeways at Critical Turns:\n- **Turn 1**: Freeways 3, 4, and 8 are unsafe (cars cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 2**: Freeways 1, 2, and 8 are unsafe.\n- **Turn 4**: Freeways 3 and 4 are unsafe.\n- All other turns and freeways are safe.\n\n### Optimal Path Explanation:\n- At turn 0, start at \\((0, 0)\\).\n- Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1 (freeway 1 is safe at turn 1).\n- At turn 1, \\(y = 1\\) is safe, but moving up to \\(y = 2\\) or staying at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2 would cause a collision (freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe at turn 2). Thus, move down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 2 (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no freeway).\n- From turn 2, \\(y = 0\\), move up sequentially to \\(y = 9\\):\n  - Turn 2: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3 (freeway 1 safe at turn 3).\n  - Turn 3: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4 (freeway 2 safe at turn 4, as unsafe only at turn 2).\n  - Turn 4: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5 (freeway 3 safe at turn 5, as unsafe at turns 1 and 4).\n  - Turn 5: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6 (freeway 4 safe at turn 6).\n  - Turn 6: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7 (freeway 5 always safe).\n  - Turn 7: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8 (freeway 6 always safe).\n  - Turn 8: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9 (freeway 7 always safe).\n  - Turn 9: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10 (freeway 8 safe at turn 10, as unsafe only at turns 1 and 2).\n  - Turn 10: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway).\n\nThis path avoids all collisions and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 11 turns, which is minimal because:\n- At turn 2, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision (since \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are unsafe, and higher \\(y\\) values are unreachable by turn 2).\n- From \\(y = 0\\) at turn 2, reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 9 more turns (as each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1), leading to a minimum of 11 turns total.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe actions are applied at turns \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 10\\) to achieve \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: D \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,1) at turn t1 = 1. The goal is to reach (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new row until the next turn. So if at turn T, you move to y_{T+1}, you're still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=1. For each car, we have head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction \"left\" means it's moving left, so position decreases over time. \"Right\" means moving right, position increases.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 1 to some turn H where y=9, with minimal H.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn 1 for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): one car: head=12, tail=47, direction=left, speed=36. Since it's left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] = [12,47]. But head and tail: for left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so if it's moving left, head should be the rightmost point? I need to clarify the notation.\n\nThe update rule says:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in Span(T).\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36). So for left-moving, it's given as (h,τ) = (12,47). But 12 to 47, with direction left, so since it's moving left, the head at t1 is at 12, tail at 47? That seems odd because if head is at 12 and moving left, tail should be to the right, so tail at 47 means the car extends from x=12 to x=47? But if moving left, the front is at min x, I think I'm confused.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAssume the x-axis increases to the right.\n\nFor a left-moving car: it is moving towards decreasing x. So the \"head\" is the front, which has smaller x, and \"tail\" has larger x. But in the span, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] and for right-moving, [τ, h].\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,47,left,36). So h=12, τ=47. Since left-moving, Span = [h,τ] = [12,47]. But if moving left, and x decreases, at t1, it occupies from x=12 to x=47. Then as time passes, both decrease, so it moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car, like in freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,12), so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor right-moving: it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head. And since moving right, head has larger x.\n\nIn freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,12), so τ=-47, h=-36? But it says (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this car, head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right.\n\nBut for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head].\n\nτ is tail, which should be the rear, so for right-moving, tail has smaller x, head has larger x.\n\nIn this case, tail=-47, head=-36, so since -47 < -36, tail at -47, head at -36, so the car spans from x=-47 to x=-36, and moving right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head at 12, tail at 47, but 12 < 47, so if head is front and moving left, head should have smaller x, so at x=12, tail at x=47, meaning the car is from 12 to 47, but since moving left, front is at 12, rear at 47? That doesn't make sense because if moving left, front should be left, smaller x.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in the notation.\n\nLet me read the update rule again.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIf h and τ are positions, and moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47.\n\nSince it's moving left, at t1, it spans from min to max? [h,τ] = [12,47], so x from 12 to 47.\n\nAfter time, both decrease, so it moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, freeway 3: one car is (-36,-47,right,12), so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head].\n\nHere τ=-47, h=-36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36], which is from x=-47 to x=-36.\n\nMoving right, so positions increase.\n\nIn the collision check, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\n0 is the player's x-position, since player is always at x=0.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, at turn T, if 0 is in the span, and player is on y=k at turn T, collision.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 at turn 1.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, no cars there, so safe.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, freeways 1 to 8 in between.\n\nPlayer can be at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision risk there.\n\nNow, at turn 1, player is at (0,1), so on freeway 1.\n\nWe need to check if at turn 1, there is a car on freeway 1 where 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 1 at turn t1=1: car with span [12,47], left-moving, speed 36.\n\n0 is not between 12 and 47, so no collision at turn 1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at turn 1.\n\nBut collision is only when player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find for each freeway, for each car, the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen, for a given turn T, freeway k is safe if no car on k has 0 in span at T.\n\nPlayer can be on freeway k at turn T only if k is safe at T.\n\nNow, the player moves vertically, so we need to choose actions to go from y=1 to y=9, changing y by -1,0,1 each turn, staying within 0-9, and at each turn, when on a freeway y_t, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nSince when you move, you are on the current y until the move completes, so for action at turn t, it determines y_{t+1}, but for collision at turn t, it's based on y_t.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen action a_t is chosen: U, D, or S.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy as defined.\n\nThen, for collision at turn t: it depends on y_t, and the car spans at turn t.\n\nBecause the player is on freeway y_t during turn t.\n\nThen after action, at start of turn t+1, player is at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nYes, so at turn T, you are on y_T for collision.\n\nOnly when you are on a freeway at that turn, you check for cars on that freeway.\n\nNow, for the goal: we need to have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, so at turn t1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd we have a sequence of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 2}, I think.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for actions, let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt time t1, action a_{t1}, then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy from a_{t1}.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so after a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe position after H turns: starts at turn t1, after 0 actions, position (0,y_{t1}).\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, position becomes (0, y_{t1+1}) at turn t1+1.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, at turn t1 + k, position is (0, y_{t1 + k}).\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, with y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, we are at (0,9), and since y=9 is not a freeway, no collision check, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, at start, turn t1, we are at (0,1), which is freeway 1, but we already checked no collision at t1.\n\nNow, we need to find minimal H and actions to reach y=9 from y=1.\n\nThe shortest path in terms of moves: from y=1 to y=9, minimum moves are 8 up actions, but we have to avoid the freeways when cars are present, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since we want minimal turns, we should go up as fast as possible, unless blocked.\n\nBut with the car hazards, we might need to delay or take detour.\n\nFirst, I need to compute for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns, T is integer, turns start from t1=1.\n\nLet t be absolute turn number, with t1=1.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and their span over time.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOne car: (h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at time T: [h - s(T-1), τ - s(T-1)] since t1=1.\n\nGeneral: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)] for left-moving.\n\nt1=1.\n\nSo Span(T) = [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nSince the span is a interval, 0 in [A,B] if A <= 0 <= B.\n\nHere A = 12 - 36(T-1), B = 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nSo A <= 0 <= B\n\nFirst, A <= 0: 12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 => 12 <= 36(T-1) => T-1 >= 12/36 = 1/3, so T-1 >= 1 since T integer, T-1 >=1, T>=2\n\nSecond, 0 <= B: 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1) => 36(T-1) <= 47 => T-1 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T-1 <=1 since integer, T-1 <=1, T<=2\n\nSo A <=0 <=B only when T=2.\n\nFor T=2: A = 12 - 36(1) = 12-36= -24, B=47-36=11, so -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nFor T=1: A=12-36(0)=12, B=47, 12<=0<=47? 0<12, false, 0 not >= A, so not in span.\n\nT=3: A=12-36(2)=12-72=-60, B=47-72=-25, -60<=0<=-25? 0 <= -25 false, not in span.\n\nSo only at T=2, freeway 1 is unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nSame as freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so identical, only unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nMultiple cars: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] since t1=1.\n\nGiven (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this car, head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-47, -36]\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-47 + 12(T-1), -36 + 12(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12(T-1) <= 0 <= -36 +12(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: -47 +12(T-1) <=0 => 12(T-1) <=47 => T-1 <=47/12≈3.916, so T-1 <=3 for integer, T<=4\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 +12(T-1) => 36 <=12(T-1) => 12(T-1) >=36 => T-1 >=3, T>=4\n\nSo both: T-1 >=3 and T-1 <=3, so T-1=3, T=4\n\nAt T=4: Span(T) = [-47 +12(3), -36 +12(3)] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], so -11 <=0<=0, yes 0 included.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, dir=right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0] for right-moving? τ=tail=-11, h=head=0, so [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-11 + 12(T-1), 0 + 12(T-1)] = [-11 +12(T-1), 12(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12(T-1) <=0 <= 12(T-1)\n\nFirst: -11 +12(T-1) <=0 => 12(T-1) <=11 => T-1 <=11/12≈0.916, so T-1 <=0, T<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=12(T-1) => T-1 >=0, T>=1\n\nSo T=1\n\nAt T=1: Span = [-11 +0, 0] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25? But for right-moving, head should be larger than tail? 36>25, but tail=25, head=36, so [τ,h] = [25,36]? Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [25,36]\n\nThen Span(T) = [25 +12(T-1), 36 +12(T-1)]\n\n0 in span? 25 +12(T-1) <=0 <=36 +12(T-1)\n\nFirst: 25 +12(T-1) <=0, 12(T-1) <= -25, impossible since left side >=0 for T>=1, so never <=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=36 +12(T-1) always true for T>=1.\n\nBut since A=25+12(T-1) >0 for all T>=1, so 0 not in [A,B] since A>0.\n\nSo this car never has 0 in span.\n\nThus for freeway 3, unsafe when:\n\nFrom first car: unsafe at T=4\n\nSecond car: unsafe at T=1\n\nThird car: always safe\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nSame cars as freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 3, so unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nCars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) head=60, tail=49, dir=right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [49,60] for right-moving? τ=tail=49, h=head=60, so [49,60]\n\nSpan(T) = [49 +12(T-1), 60 +12(T-1)]\n\n0 in span? 49+12(T-1) <=0 <=60+12(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: 49+12(T-1) <=0, 12(T-1) <= -49, impossible for T>=1.\n\nSecond always true, but A>0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) head=12, tail=1, dir=right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nSpan(T) = [1 +12(T-1), 12 +12(T-1)] = [1 +12(T-1), 12(1 + (T-1))] = [1 +12(T-1), 12T]\n\n12 +12(T-1) = 12T, yes.\n\n0 in span if 1 +12(T-1) <=0 <= 12T\n\nFirst: 1 +12(T-1) <=0 => 12(T-1) <= -1, impossible.\n\nSecond: 0 <=12T, always true.\n\nA=1+12(T-1) >=1>0 for T>=1, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus freeway 5 has no cars that cover 0 at any time? Both cars are to the right, min x=1 or 49, so 0 not covered. Always safe.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nFirst car span from 49 to 60, moving right, always x>=49>0.\n\nSecond car: at t1, [1,12], both >0, and increasing, so min x=1 at T=1, to higher, so 0 never in span. Yes, freeway 5 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nSame as freeway 5: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nIdentical, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nAlso same: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4) head=52, tail=41, dir=right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [41,52]\n\nSpan(T) = [41 +4(T-1), 52 +4(T-1)]\n\n0 in span? 41+4(T-1) <=0 <=52+4(T-1)\n\nA=41+4(T-1) >=41>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4) head=4, tail=-7, dir=right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-7,4]\n\nSpan(T) = [-7 +4(T-1), 4 +4(T-1)] = [-7 +4(T-1), 4T]\n\n0 in span if -7 +4(T-1) <=0 <= 4T\n\nFirst inequality: -7 +4(T-1) <=0 => 4(T-1) <=7 => T-1 <=7/4=1.75, so T-1 <=1, T<=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <=4T, always true for T>=1.\n\nNow, 0 in [A,B] if A<=0 and 0<=B.\n\nHere A = -7 +4(T-1), B=4T\n\nFor T=1: A= -7 +4(0) = -7, B=4(1)=4, so -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nT=2: A= -7 +4(1) = -7+4= -3, B=8, -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\nT=3: A= -7 +4(2) = -7+8=1, B=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, false, not <=A, so not in span.\n\nSo unsafe at T=1 and T=2 for this car.\n\nFirst car always safe, so freeway 8 unsafe at T=1 and T=2.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=1 and T=4\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=1 and T=4\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=1 and T=2\n\nNow, player starts at turn t=1, y=1.\n\nAt turn t=1, player is on y=1.\n\ny=1 is unsafe only at T=2, at T=1 it is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt T=1, for y=1, span [12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at T=1.\n\nBut player is on y=1 at T=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since from y=1 to y=9, need to increase y by 8, so minimum 8 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn, so we need at least 8 turns to go from 1 to 9 with only up moves.\n\nBut with hazards, we might need more turns if we have to wait.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nWe start at t=1, y=1.\n\nAt t=1, we choose action a_1, which determines y_2.\n\nThen at t=2, we are on y_2, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are always safe, we can be there any time.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=2\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=2\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=1 and t=4\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=1 and t=4\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=1 and t=2\n\nAt t=1, player is on y=1, which is safe at t=1.\n\nIf we go up immediately, to y=2 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2 is unsafe, because freeway 2 unsafe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=1 at t=2, but y=1 unsafe at t=2.\n\nIf we go down to y=0 at t=2, but y=0 is not freeway, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nOptions at t=1:\n\n- Action U: go to y=2 at t=2. But at t=2, if on y=2, unsafe.\n\n- Action S: stay at y=1 at t=2. But at t=2, y=1 unsafe.\n\n- Action D: go to y=0 at t=2. y=0 safe, no cars.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, from y=0, we can go up to y=1 at t=3, or stay, but we need to go up.\n\nAt t=3, y=1: is it safe?\n\nFor y=1, unsafe only at t=2, at t=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=3: unsafe only at t=2, so at t=3 safe.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, so at t=3 safe? t=1 and t=4 unsafe, t=3 not listed, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe can go directly up if we avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 always safe, we can go through them quickly.\n\nBut we have to pass the lower freeways.\n\nStart at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nWe cannot stay or go up at t=1 because that would put us on y=1 or y=2 at t=2, both unsafe.\n\nSo only option: go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nAction a_1 = D.\n\nThen at t=2, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=2, position (0,0), not freeway, safe.\n\nActions: a_2 can be U, S, or D.\n\nIf we go up, to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=1 is safe, since unsafe only t=2.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=2, etc.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom t=2, y=0.\n\nWe can go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=1 safe.\n\nThen from y=1, we can go up to y=2 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=2: y=2 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=4 safe? Yes.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at t=2, so t=4 safe.\n\nBut we also have y=3 and y=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nWe need to be careful.\n\nAt t=3, if we are at y=1, action a_3: we can go U to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=2 is safe (since unsafe only t=2).\n\nBut if we go to y=3 or y=4 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nNow, from y=2 at t=4, we can go to y=3 at t=5.\n\nt=5: y=3 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, so t=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's plan the sequence.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no hazards, we could go up 8 times in 8 turns.\n\nWith hazards, we might need more.\n\nCurrently, at t=1, we must go down to avoid t=2 hazard.\n\nSo we lose one turn going down, then we need to go up.\n\nFrom y=0, we can go up to y=1 at t=3, then to y=2 at t=4, both safe.\n\nThen from y=2, to y=3 at t=5 (since at t=4 y=3 unsafe if we were there, but we go to y=3 at t=5).\n\nAt t=4, if we are on y=3, unsafe, but we are going to y=3 at t=5.\n\nLet's list turns and positions.\n\nTurn t: position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}\n\nAt turn t, collision based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nStart:\n\nt=1: y_1 = 1, safe (as we saw)\n\nAction a_1: must avoid being on y=1 or y=2 at t=2, since both unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo a_1 cannot be S or U, because:\n\n- If a_1 = S, then y_2 = y_1 =1, at t=2 on y=1, unsafe.\n\n- If a_1 = U, then y_2 =2, at t=2 on y=2, unsafe.\n\n- If a_1 = D, then y_2 =0, at t=2 on y=0, safe, not freeway.\n\nSo a_1 must be D.\n\nThen at t=2: y_2 =0, safe.\n\nNow action a_2: at t=2, we can choose to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=-1? y must be in 0-9, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so from y=0, cannot go down, y=0 is min.\n\nSo a_2 can be S or U.\n\nIf S, y_3=0, stay at y=0.\n\nBut we need to move up, so better to go up.\n\nIf U, y_3=1.\n\nAt t=3, we will be on y=3? No.\n\nAt turn t=3, position y_3.\n\nIf a_2=U, then y_3=1.\n\nAt turn t=3, on y=1.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay, y_3=0, safe but not progressing.\n\nSo better to go up, a_2=U.\n\nThen at t=3: y_3=1, safe.\n\nAction a_3: can go to y=2, or stay, or down to y=0.\n\nIf go to y=2, then at t=4, on y=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=4 safe.\n\nIf stay, y_4=1, also safe at t=4.\n\nBut to progress, go up.\n\na_3=U, then y_4=2.\n\nAt t=4: y_4=2, safe (since unsafe only t=2).\n\nAction a_4: can go to y=3, or stay, or down to y=1.\n\nIf go to y=3, then at t=5, on y=3? No.\n\ny_{t+1} after action.\n\na_4 at t=4 determines y_5.\n\nAt turn t=5, position y_5.\n\nIf a_4=U, then y_5=3.\n\nAt turn t=5, on y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, so at t=5, safe? t=1 and t=4, t=5 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go directly.\n\nBut we have to go through y=4 as well.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, if we were on y=4, unsafe, but we are on y=2 at t=4, going to y=3 or whatever.\n\nLet's continue.\n\nFrom above, at t=4, y_4=2.\n\na_4=U, to y_5=3.\n\nThen at t=5: y_5=3, safe.\n\nAction a_5: can go to y=4.\n\nIf a_5=U, then y_6=4.\n\nAt turn t=6, on y=4? Position y_6=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, so at t=6, safe? t=6 not t=1 or t=4, so safe.\n\nThen at t=6: y_6=4, safe.\n\nAction a_6: go to y=5, U.\n\ny_7=5.\n\nAt t=7: y_7=5, and y=5 always safe.\n\nThen go up to y=6 at t=8, y_8=6, safe.\n\nTo y=7 at t=9, y_9=7, safe.\n\nTo y=8 at t=10, y_10=8.\n\nNow, at t=10, on y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=1 and t=2.\n\nt=10, not t=1 or t=2, so safe? Yes.\n\nThen action a_10: go to y=9, U.\n\ny_11=9.\n\nThen at turn t=11, we are at (0,9), done.\n\nBut we reached at t=11, with y_11=9.\n\nNow, number of turns: started at t=1, reached at t=11, so H such that t1 + H =11? t1=1, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nEarlier: after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nHere, after actions from t=1 to t=10, we have 10 actions? Let's count.\n\nAt turn t=1: position y_1=1, take action a_1\n\nAfter a_1, at turn t=2, y_2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_k, at turn t=k+1, y_{k+1}\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, with actions:\n\nt=1: y_1=1, a_1=D → y_2=0\n\nt=2: y_2=0, a_2=U → y_3=1\n\nt=3: y_3=1, a_3=U → y_4=2\n\nt=4: y_4=2, a_4=U → y_5=3\n\nt=5: y_5=3, a_5=U → y_6=4\n\nt=6: y_6=4, a_6=U → y_7=5\n\nt=7: y_7=5, a_7=U → y_8=6\n\nt=8: y_8=6, a_8=U → y_9=7\n\nt=9: y_9=7, a_9=U → y_10=8\n\nt=10: y_10=8, a_10=U → y_11=9\n\nSo at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nWe took actions from a_1 to a_10, 10 actions, reached at turn 11.\n\nBut we started at turn 1, and after 10 actions, turn 11.\n\nH is the number of actions? The sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, that is H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position.\n\nHere t1=1, after H actions, turn 1+H.\n\nWe want y_{1+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, y_{11}=9, so 1+H=11, H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? We had to go down once, so instead of 8 up, we have 9 moves up and one down, but net +8, from 1 to 9, with one extra turn.\n\nCan we do with fewer turns?\n\nFor example, at the beginning, instead of going down, can we go up later?\n\nBut at t=2, y=1 and y=2 both unsafe, so we must not be on them at t=2.\n\nGoing down is one way.\n\nAnother option: at t=1, go down to y=0.\n\nThen at t=2, at y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, we could stay, but that would take more turns.\n\nOr, from y=0 at t=2, we can go to y=1 at t=3, as before.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 are unsafe at t=4, but we don't have to be there at t=4.\n\nIn the above path, we are at y=2 at t=4, which is safe, and go to y=3 at t=5, safe.\n\nt=4 is unsafe for y=3 and y=4, but we are not on them.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we can go through the always safe freeways earlier.\n\nBut we start at y=1.\n\nAt t=1, we go down to y=0.\n\nThen at t=2, at y=0, we go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, at y=1, we can go up to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, at y=2, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=3 at t=5, can we go directly to higher?\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn.\n\nFrom y=2, we can go to y=3 at t=5, as before.\n\ny=5,6,7 always safe, so we can go quickly through them.\n\nBut we have to pass y=3 and y=4.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=1 and t=2, but at later times safe.\n\nIn the above, we reach y=8 at t=10, which is after t=2, so safe.\n\nCan we arrive earlier?\n\nFor example, if we don't go down, but we have to at t=2.\n\nAnother idea: at t=1, since we must leave y=1 and y=2 for t=2, we go down to y=0.\n\nThen at t=2, at y=0, we could, instead of going to y=1, but we have to go up eventually.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some levels by moving faster, but we can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nMinimal H: from y=1 to y=9, need at least 8 turns if all up, but with hazard at t=2, we need to be not on y=1 or y=2 at t=2, so we must be at y=0 or y=3 or above at t=2.\n\nBut at t=1, we are at y=1.\n\nWith one action, we can go to y=0, y=1 (stay), or y=2.\n\nGo to y=2: at t=2 on y=2 unsafe.\n\nStay: at t=2 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=0: safe.\n\nGo to y=3? Not possible, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo only choice is go to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow from y=0, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 to y=9, minimum 9 up moves, but we can start from t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nWe can go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=4.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=5.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=7.\n\ny=6 at t=8.\n\ny=7 at t=9.\n\ny=8 at t=10.\n\ny=9 at t=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=4, y=3 and y=4 are unsafe, but in this, we are at y=2 at t=4, not on y=3 or y=4.\n\nThen at t=5, we go to y=3, which is safe at t=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nCan we be at y=3 or y=4 at a safe time?\n\nFor example, at t=3, if we can be at y=3, but from y=0 at t=2, we can only be at y=1 at t=3, not y=3 directly.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nPerhaps at t=2, from y=0, we stay or something, but that delays more.\n\nFor example, if at t=2, we stay at y=0, then at t=3, go to y=1, etc., we reach later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the above seems efficient.\n\nBut we have y=5,6,7 always safe, so once we reach y=5, we can go up fast.\n\nIn the sequence, we reach y=5 at t=7 (y_7=5), then to y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=5 at t=7? In the sequence: at t=6, y_6=4, a_6=U to y_7=5 at t=7.\n\nThen a_7=U to y_8=6 at t=8, etc.\n\nBut y=8 is safe except t=1,2, so at t=10 it is safe.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can avoid the down move.\n\nBut at t=2, we must not be on y=1 or y=2.\n\nSo we have to be elsewhere.\n\ny=0 is the only option.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=3 at some point when safe.\n\nBut at t=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\nAll lead to problem at t=2 except y=0.\n\nAnother thought: at t=1, we go down to y=0.\n\nThen at t=2, at y=0, we go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nNow, at t=3, at y=1, we could go directly to y=2, but y=2 at t=4 is safe, as before.\n\nSince y=3 is unsafe at t=4, we should not be on y=3 at t=4.\n\nIn our sequence, we are at y=2 at t=4, not y=3.\n\nAt t=5, we go to y=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe at t=4, so at t=4, we should not be on y=4, which we are not.\n\nAt t=6, we go to y=4, which is safe at t=6.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut we used 10 actions to go from y=1 to y=9 with net 8 up, but one down and one extra up.\n\nTotal turns: from start turn 1 to end turn 11, 11 turns, but with actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nThe minimal possible: since we must be at y=0 at t=2, and from y=0 to y=9 min 9 turns, so from t=2 to t=11, 10 turns? From t=2 to t=11 is 10 turns? Turns: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 that's 10 positions, but we start at t=2 y=0, after k actions, at turn t=2+k.\n\nSet t=2 as starting point.\n\nAt turn t=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nMinimal T: since y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 actions, so after 9 actions, at turn t=2+9=11, y=9.\n\nExactly as we have.\n\nIf we could start from higher, but we start from y=1 at t=1.\n\nBut due to hazard, we go down first.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from a_1 to a_10.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions for turns starting from t_1=1.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn t1=1: a1 = D\n\nThen turn t1+1=2: a2 = U\n\nt1+2=3: a3=U\n\n...\n\nUp to a10 for turn 10.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0,1,2,...,H-1\n\nHere t1=1, so actions a_1, a_2, ..., a_H\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nSo for us, t1 + H =11, H=10.\n\nActions: a1 to a10.\n\nIn the sequence above: a1=D, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn 11.\n\nIn the freeways, y=8 at t=10 is safe, and we go to y=9.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=5 to t=6, we go from y=3 to y=4 at t=6, which is safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=4, but t=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we have to check if at any point we are on a freeway when unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=1: y=1, safe\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=1, safe (y=1 unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=4: y=2, safe (y=2 unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=5: y=3, safe (y=3 unsafe t=1,4; t=5 safe)\n\nt=6: y=4, safe (y=4 unsafe t=1,4; t=6 safe)\n\nt=7: y=5, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, safe\n\nt=10: y=8, safe (y=8 unsafe t=1,2; t=10 safe)\n\nt=11: y=9, goal, not freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd we used only necessary down at start.\n\nCan we go faster through the always safe zones?\n\nFor example, from y=4, we go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=5,6,7 always safe, y=8 safe after t=2.\n\nIn our sequence, we go from y=4 at t=6 to y=5 at t=7, y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 safe, we could stay or move, but moving up is faster.\n\nNo need to stay.\n\nBut we cannot skip levels.\n\nAnother idea: after y=2 at t=4, instead of going to y=3 at t=5, we could go to y=1 or something, but that would not help.\n\nOr, since y=3 safe at t=5, we go up.\n\nI think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=1 and t=2, but at t=10, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=8 at t=10, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by being on y=8 earlier, but y=8 unsafe at t=1,2, so before t=3 not possible.\n\nAt t=3, we are at y=1, which is far.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nNow, the actions: as above.\n\nIn the sequence, a1=D, then a2 to a10 all U, except a2 is U from y=0 to y=1.\n\nIn the list: from turn 1 to turn 10.\n\nt1=1: a1=D\n\nt1+1=2: a2=U\n\nt1+2=3: a3=U\n\nt1+3=4: a4=U\n\nt1+4=5: a5=U\n\nt1+5=6: a6=U\n\nt1+6=7: a7=U\n\nt1+7=8: a8=U\n\nt1+8=9: a9=U\n\nt1+9=10: a10=U\n\nAfter that, at turn t1 + H =1+10=11, y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=10, actions at t=1 to t=10.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut we need to write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions except first are U.\n\nBut let's write the turn numbers.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut turn 10 is a_{10}, which leads to y_{11}=9.\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nIn the box, it should be the actions.\n\nThe sequence is from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, I think.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=1, so turns: 1+0=1, 1+1=2, ..., up to 1 + (H-1) = H\n\nSince H=10, turns 1 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 3 and 4, we have cars, but in the path, we are on y=3 at t=5, y=4 at t=6, both safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 3 at t=5.\n\nFreeway 3: cars, at T=5.\n\nFirst car: left-moving? Freeway 3 has right-moving cars.\n\nEarlier: at T, for first car: (-36,-47,right,12), Span(T) = [-47 +12(T-1), -36 +12(T-1)]\n\nT=5, T-1=4, Span= [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in, good.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), Span(T) = [-11 +12(T-1), 12(T-1)]\n\nT=5, [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (36,25,right,12)? Head=36,tail=25, but earlier we said it doesn't cover 0.\n\nSpan at T=5: [25+12(4), 36+48] = [25+48, 36+48]=[73,84], not near 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, minimal H=10, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the actions, from turn 3 to 10, all U, which is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\nThe car positions and movements are analyzed to determine unsafe turns for each freeway:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 1\\) and \\(T = 4\\).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 1\\) and \\(T = 4\\).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 1\\) and \\(T = 2\\).\n\nAt turn \\(T = 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 1\\), which is safe (no collision). However, at \\(T = 2\\), both \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are unsafe, so the player must not be on these freeways at \\(T = 2\\). The only safe action at \\(T = 1\\) is to move down to \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway, so no collision risk).\n\nFrom \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 2\\), the player can move up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 3\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=2, and I'm at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, the car on that row doesn't have 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T). Span(T) depends on the initial head and tail at t₁=2, and the speed and direction.\n\nLet me denote the time from t₁. So at time t=0 (which is turn t₁=2), I'm at (0,0). I need to reach (0,9) at some turn H, so after H turns, I'm at y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns t₁ to t₁+H-1, and after H actions, I'm at y=9.\n\nThe position is updated after each action, so after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nI start at t=0 (turn t₁) with y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at t=1, y= y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nLet me define τ = T - t₁, so τ is the time offset from current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action at τ, y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for τ=0 to H-1, such that at τ=H, y_H =9? No.\n\nLet's see: at turn t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1, action a_{t₁+t}.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t₁ + H.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is t₁ + H, I think.\n\nStart at turn t₁: position (0, y_{t₁}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, position (0, y_{t₁+1})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t₁+H-1}, at turn t₁+H, position (0, y_{t₁+H})\n\nWe want y_{t₁+H} =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns from t₁ to t₁+H-1, so H actions.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, when I am on some row y_T, I need that for the car on freeway y_T, 0 is not in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is based on the state at t₁.\n\nFor a car, at time T (absolute turn), Span(T) = [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)] for left-moving, or [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] for right-moving? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut h and τ are head and tail, I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSo h = -24, τ = 11? But for left-moving, if head is at -24 and tail at 11, that seems backward because left-moving should have head on left or right?\n\nLet's clarify the direction.\n\nIt says: left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so decreasing x.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, but if it's moving left, the head should be the leftmost point or rightmost?\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the car state:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSpan(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nBut -24 to 11, that's from left to right, but it's left-moving, which is confusing.\n\nPerhaps h and τ are not ordered; it says head and tail.\n\nIn the update for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSince it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nAt T=t₁, Span = [h, τ] = [-24,11] for freeway 1.\n\n-24 to 11, that's a length of 35? 11 - (-24) = 35, and speed 36, which is fast.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: (-24, -35, right, 12), so h and τ, but for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nIn the car update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] with ΔT = T-t₁\n\nRight-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, for right-moving, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), but for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail, which is left, h is head, right.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: first car: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nSo for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But it says (head, tail), so head h = -24, tail τ = -35, so tail is at -35, head at -24, so the car is from x= -35 to x= -24, length 11, and moving right, so Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1: head h = -24, tail τ = 11, so Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11], and moving left, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-24 - 36ΔT, 11 - 36ΔT]\n\nIn this case, at t₁, from -24 to 11, which is from left to right, but moving left, so it will shift left.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: if I move to a different row at turn T, I am not on that row until the next turn. Specifically, when I take action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I am on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision check is at turn T for row y_T.\n\nIf I decide to move to a different y at turn T, meaning a_T is U or D, then at turn T, I am on y_T, and at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo when I am on a row at turn T, I check the car on that row at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if 0 is in span at T, but not at T+1, it's fine.\n\nBut since you are not on that row at T, you don't care about that row at T.\n\nOnly the row you are on at turn T matters for collision at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so only when I am on rows 1-8, I need to avoid the cars.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no collision possible.\n\nI start at y=0 at τ=0 (turn t₁=2).\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn after H actions.\n\nSince I start at 0 and need to go to 9, and I can move up or down or stay, but since 9 is up, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\ny is between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nFrom 0, if I go D, y becomes -1, but y in [0,9], so it must be clamped? The update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so I think it is bounded, so if I try to go down from 0, y stays 0, similarly from 9, up stays 9.\n\nIn this case, from 0, if I do D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1), similarly for up.\n\nBut since I need to go to 9, I probably won't go down, so I can assume I only use U and S, or sometimes D to avoid, but D might not be useful since I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, from 9, I can't go up.\n\nBut I start at 0, end at 9, so minimal turns would be 9 turns of U, but I might have to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, so with 9 U actions, I go from 0 to 9 in 9 turns, but I might have to take S or D to avoid, which increases H.\n\nBut with S, I stay, so H increases, so to minimize H, I should avoid S and D if possible, only U, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nSo I need to find a path from row 0 to row 9 in time, avoiding the car collisions on rows 1-8 at each turn.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so the spans change over time.\n\nI need to simulate the car positions over time.\n\nLet me define Δτ = T - t₁, so at time τ, which is turn t₁ + τ.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t₁=2.\n\nI am at y at time τ.\n\nFor each freeway, I need the span at time τ.\n\nSince the cars on each freeway are given, and for each, I can compute when 0 is in the span.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time τ if 0 is in span of car on k at time τ.\n\nFor a given freeway and time, if there is a car covering x=0 at that time, then it's occupied, I cannot be there.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h= -24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed s=36\n\nSpan at τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] = [-24 -36τ, 11 -36τ]  (since left-moving)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-24,11,left,36), so identical to freeway 1.\n\n| Freeway | Cars |\n\n1: only one car: (-24,11,left,36)\n\n2: (-24,11,left,36) same as 1.\n\n3: three cars: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] for each car.\n\nFirst car: head h= -24? Head is given first, but for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so tail τ= -35, head h= -24, so span [-35, -24] at τ=0.\n\nThen at time τ, Span = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, so span [1,12] at τ=0, at τ: [1 +12τ, 12+12τ]\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, span [37,48] at τ=0, at τ: [37+12τ, 48+12τ]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, span [-59,-48] at τ=0, at τ: [-59+12τ, -48+12τ]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at τ=0, at τ: [13+12τ, 24+12τ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6? (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12) yes.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (56,45,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=56, tail=45, span [45,56] at τ=0, at τ: [45+4τ, 56+4τ]\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4), head=8, tail=-3, span [-3,8] at τ=0, at τ: [-3+4τ, 8+4τ]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which τ, x=0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given k and τ, is 0 in the span of any car on row k.\n\nThen, when I am on row k at time τ, it must be that 0 is not covered, so safe.\n\nNow, let's find for each row, the times when it is occupied (0 covered).\n\nStart with row 1:\n\nOne car: span at τ: [-24 -36τ, 11 -36τ]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36τ\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is decreasing.\n\nLeft inequality: -24 -36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ -36τ ≤ 24 ⇒ τ ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, but τ≥0, so always true for τ≥0? -24 -36τ ≤ 0 is -36τ ≤ 24, divide by -36, reverse inequality, τ ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, and since τ≥0, this is always true.\n\n-24 -36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ -36τ ≤ 24 ⇒ multiply both sides by -1, reverse: 36τ ≥ -24, so τ ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, and since τ≥0, τ ≥0 satisfies, so left inequality always true for τ≥0.\n\nNow right inequality: 0 ≤ 11 -36τ ⇒ 0 ≤ 11 -36τ ⇒ 36τ ≤ 11 ⇒ τ ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo 0 in span when τ ≤ 11/36\n\nSince τ is integer (turns), τ=0,1,2,... but τ≤11/36≈0.305, so only at τ=0.\n\nτ=0: -24 ≤0≤11?

τ integer, τ=2 and τ=3? 35/12=2.916, so τ≤2.916, so τ=2.\n\nCheck: τ=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so -11≤0≤0, yes 0 included.\n\nτ=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nτ=1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2 for first car.\n\nSecond car: span [1+12τ, 12+12τ]\n\n0 in span: 1+12τ ≤0≤12+12τ\n\nLeft: 1+12τ ≤0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ -1 ⇒ τ ≤ -1/12, impossible since τ≥0.\n\nSo never covered by second car, since min x is 1+12τ ≥1 >0 for τ≥0.\n\nThird car: [37+12τ, 48+12τ] min 37>0, so always positive, never cover 0.\n\nSo for row 3, only covered at τ=2 by first car.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 same as row 3, covered only at τ=2.\n\nNow row 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [-59+12τ, -48+12τ]\n\n0 in span: -59+12τ ≤0≤ -48+12τ\n\nLeft: -59+12τ ≤0 ⇒ 12τ ≤59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916\n\nRight: 0≤ -48+12τ ⇒ 48≤12τ ⇒ τ≥4\n\nSo for τ integer, τ=4 and τ=5?

Let's sequence:\n\nτ=0: y=0\n\na_0=U: τ=1, y=1\n\na_1=U: τ=2, y=2\n\na_2=U: τ=3, y=3\n\na_3=U: τ=4, y=4\n\na_4=U: τ=5, y=5\n\na_5=U: τ=6, y=6\n\na_6=U: τ=7, y=7\n\na_7=U: τ=8, y=8\n\na_8=U: τ=9, y=9\n\nNow at each τ, position:\n\nτ=0: y=0, safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, row1: at τ=1, not occupied (only τ=0), safe\n\nτ=2: y=2, row2: at τ=2, not occupied (only τ=0), safe\n\nτ=3: y=3, row3: at τ=3, not occupied (only τ=2), safe\n\nτ=4: y=4, row4: at τ=4, not occupied (only τ=2), safe\n\nτ=5: y=5, row5: at τ=5, not occupied (only τ=4), safe\n\nτ=6: y=6, row6: at τ=6, not occupied (only τ=4), safe\n\nτ=7: y=7, row7: at τ=7, not occupied (only τ=4), safe\n\nτ=8: y=8, row8: at τ=8, not occupied (only τ=0), safe\n\nτ=9: y=9, safe\n\nAll seem fine. But is row 5 occupied at τ=4? Yes, but at τ=4 I am on y=4, not y=5. Row 5 is occupied at τ=4, but I am not on row 5 at τ=4; I am on row 4 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, I am on row 5, but row 5 is not occupied at τ=5, only at τ=4.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut row 8 at τ=0 occupied, but at τ=0 I am on y=0, not row 8.\n\nSo the sequence with all U seems to avoid all collisions.\n\nBut let me confirm row 8 at τ=0: occupied, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2, row 3 occupied, but I am on y=2.\n\nAt τ=4, row 5 occupied, but I am on y=4.\n\nAnd when I am on the row, like row 1 at τ=1, not occupied.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nPerhaps I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) at turn t₁=2.\n\nAfter actions, reaches (0,9) at turn t₁ + H.\n\nIn this case H=9, actions from τ=0 to 8.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t₁=2.\n\nSo actions at turn: t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns 2 to 2+H-1.\n\nReach at turn t₁ + H.\n\nIn this case, with all U, H=9.\n\nActions: turn 2: U\n\nturn 3: U\n\n...\n\nturn 10: U? Let's see.\n\nt from 0 to H-1: action at t₁ + t\n\nSo for t=0: turn t₁ + 0 = 2, action a_{t₁}\n\nt=1: turn 3, action a_{t₁+1}\n\n...\n\nt=8: turn 2+8=10, action a_{t₁+8}\n\nThen at turn t₁ + H = 2+9=11, position y=9.\n\nNow, in terms of τ: at τ=0, turn 2, position y=0\n\nAfter action, at τ=1, turn 3, y=1\n\n...\n\nAt τ=9, turn 11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=0 (turn 2) y=0, not on freeway.\n\nBut row 1 is occupied at τ=0 (turn 2), but at turn 2, I am on y=0, not row 1, so no collision.\n\nAt turn 3 (τ=1), I am on y=1, row 1, which is not occupied at τ=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut is row 1 occupied at τ=0? Yes, turn t₁=2.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can do it faster? But H=9 is minimal since I need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, so at least 9 actions, H=9.\n\nWith D or S, I might take more turns, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut let me double-check the occupied times.\n\nFor row 1: at τ=0, covered, but τ=0 is turn t₁=2.\n\nAt turn 2, if I were on row 1, but I am not, I am on row 0.\n\nAt turn 3 (τ=1), row 1 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at τ=0 (turn 2) covered, but I am not on it.\n\nAt turn 10 (τ=8), I am on row 8, not covered.\n\nNow, but in the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with this, I do.\n\nBut let me see if at some point I must be on a row when it is occupied.\n\nFor example, if I were on row 1 at τ=0, but I start at row 0.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I misread the collision condition.\n\nAnother thing: the note says: if you move to a different row at turn T, you are not on that new row at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, I am moving up each turn, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and I check that row.\n\nIn the sequence, it seems fine.\n\nPerhaps for row 3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2 (turn 4), if I were on row 3, it is occupied, but in my sequence at τ=2 (turn 4), I am on y=2, row 2, not row 3.\n\nAnd row 2 is not occupied at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it works.\n\nBut let me confirm with another row.\n\nRow 5 occupied at τ=4 (turn 6).\n\nAt turn 6 (τ=4), I am on y=4, row 4, not row 5.\n\nAt turn 7 (τ=5), I am on y=5, row 5, not occupied at τ=5.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t₁=2.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter turn 10 action, at turn 11, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to 8, actions at turn 2 to 10.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut H=9 actions, from turn 2 to 10, that's 9 actions.\n\nt_1 to t_1 + H -1 = 2 to 10, yes.\n\nNow, but let me see if I can do it in less than 9? Impossible, since from 0 to 9, need 9 steps up.\n\nUnless I start from 0, after first U, at y=1, etc., must have 9 actions.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nBut earlier I thought rows are occupied, but not when I am on them.\n\nPerhaps for row 8 at τ=0, but I am not on it.\n\nAnother thing: the freeways y=1 to 8, and I pass through them at different times.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut let me check row 8 specifically.\n\nRow 8 occupied at τ=0 (turn 2).\n\nBut at turn 2, I am on y=0.\n\nAt turn 3 (τ=1), I am on y=1, etc.\n\nWhen I reach row 8, at what time? In the sequence, at τ=8 (turn 10), y=8.\n\nRow 8 not occupied at τ=8, only at τ=0.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem might be that at τ=0, multiple rows occupied, but I start at y=0.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car at (8,-3,right,4), but at τ=0, span [-3,8], includes 0, but I am not there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all U.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to wait or something.\n\nFor example, if I had to be on row 1 at τ=0, but I don't.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence is all U from turn 2 to turn 10.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0, y_{t_1}) at turn t_1, so at turn 2, y=0.\n\nThen actions.\n\nSo I think.\n\nBut let me write it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at each turn to increase the vertical position by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThe car occupancy on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each relevant turn is as follows, based on the car states and update rules:\n- Freeway 1: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 2).\n- Freeway 2: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 2).\n- Freeway 3: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 4).\n- Freeway 4: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 4).\n- Freeway 5: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 6).\n- Freeway 6: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 6).\n- Freeway 7: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 6).\n- Freeway 8: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 2).\n\nThe path avoids collisions because:\n- At turn 2 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway), so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 3 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), the player is at \\(y = 1\\); freeway 1 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- At turn 4 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), the player is at \\(y = 2\\); freeway 2 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- At turn 5 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\); freeway 3 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 3\\).\n- At turn 6 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), the player is at \\(y = 4\\); freeway 4 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 4\\).\n- At turn 7 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), the player is at \\(y = 5\\); freeway 5 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 5\\).\n- At turn 8 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), the player is at \\(y = 6\\); freeway 6 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 6\\).\n- At turn 9 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), the player is at \\(y = 7\\); freeway 7 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 7\\).\n- At turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 8\\)), the player is at \\(y = 8\\); freeway 8 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 8\\).\n- At turn 11 (\\(\\tau = 9\\)), the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway).\n\nThus, the sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) at turn t1=3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving, it moves right. The position is given at turn t1=3, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t=3 onwards.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at turn T. Also, when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't check for collision on the new row until the next turn.\n\nNow, my initial position is y=1 at turn 3.\n\nI need to reach y=9. Since y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, as they are not freeways? The vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, but freeways are only y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars there. The player starts at (0,1), which is on freeway y=1, and ends at (0,9), which might not be a freeway, so no collision there.\n\ny=9 is the target, and since it's not a freeway (freeways are 1 to 8), there are no cars there, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9, moving up or down or stay, but since I need to go up, down might not be useful except to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be if I could go straight up without stopping, but I have to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=3.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway k=1: one car, (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nSince direction is left, it's moving left, so at turn T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] with t1=3.\n\nFor k=1: h=-60, τ=-25, d=left, s=36\n\nSo at turn T, span = [ -60 - 36(T-3) , -25 - 36(T-3) ]\n\nSimilarly, k=2: same as k=1, (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nk=3: three cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor the first car on k=3: head h=-12, tail τ=-23? The notation says (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head is larger, tail smaller? Let's see the span.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with ΔT = T-t1\n\nIn the problem, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo for right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end (head).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h is left end? In left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, but if moving left, h might be head or tail.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think in terms of the position.\n\nFor a car, at time t, it occupies a set of x-positions from left end to right end.\n\nFor left-moving car, at t1, it spans from x_left to x_right, with x_left = h, x_right = τ? In the notation, for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], so from h to τ, and since moving left, as T increases, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so from τ to h, and both increase with T.\n\nIn k=3, first car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSo at t1=3, Span = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nFor right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nSo here, tail τ = -23? But -23 is less than -12, so if τ = -23, h = -12, then [τ, h] = [-23, -12], which is from x=-23 to x=-12, and since moving right, at time T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-23 + 12(T-3), -12 + 12(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly, second car on k=3: (24,13,right,12), but 24 and 13, 13<24, so τ=13, h=24? Span = [13,24] at t=3.\n\n(24,13), so head=24, tail=13, so [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nThen at T, [13 + 12(T-3), 24 + 12(T-3)]\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, span [49,60] at t=3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nk=4 same as k=3.\n\nk=5: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47? -47 < -36, so τ=-47, h=-36, span [-47,-36] at t=3.\n\nSecond car: (36,25), head=36, tail=25, span [25,36] at t=3.\n\nk=6 same as k=5.\n\nk=7 same as k=5 and k=6? k=5 and k=6 are the same, k=7 also.\n\nk=5: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nk=6: same, k=7: same.\n\nk=8: (60,49,right,4), (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, span [49,60] at t=3.\n\nSecond car: (12,1), head=12, tail=1, span [1,12] at t=3.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince I start at turn 3 on y=1, I need to check for collision on each row when I'm there.\n\nThe key point is to avoid being on a freeway row y when at that turn, 0 is covered by a car on row y.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I move, I'm not on the new row yet for collision check.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9. The minimum steps without cars would be 8 moves up, but with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since I need to go up, down might not help much, but I could go down to avoid a car or to let it pass.\n\nBut in this case, since the cars are moving, I need to see the times when row y is safe at x=0.\n\nLet me define the safety for each row y and each turn T after t1=3.\n\nBut T starts from 3.\n\nFor a given y and T, it is safe if no car on row y has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nFor row y=1: at turn T, is there a car with 0 in span?\n\nFrom above, y=1 has one car: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nSo span at T: [h - s(T-3), τ - s(T-3)] = [-60 -36(T-3), -25 -36(T-3)]\n\nSet 0 in [left, right], so left <= 0 <= right.\n\n-60 -36ΔT <= 0 <= -25 -36ΔT, where ΔT = T-3\n\nSince T>=3, ΔT >=0.\n\n-60 -36ΔT <=0 always true for ΔT>=0? -60 -36ΔT is negative, so left <0, but we need 0 <= right, so -25 -36ΔT >=0?\n\n0 <= -25 -36ΔT? But -25 -36ΔT is always negative for ΔT>=0, since -25<0 and -36ΔT<0, so -25 -36ΔT <0, so 0 <= negative number? False.\n\nSo for y=1, at any T, the right end is -25 -36ΔT <= -25 <0, so 0 is never in the span because the car is entirely left of 0 and moving left, so it never reaches 0. Similarly for the tail.\n\nLeft end: -60 -36ΔT, right end: -25 -36ΔT, both decreasing, always less than 0, so 0 is never in [left, right], so y=1 is always safe? Is that right?\n\nBut at T=3, span is [-60,-25], which is from -60 to -25, so x from -60 to -25, 0 is not in there, and as time goes, it moves left, so even farther from 0, so yes, for y=1, since the car is far left and moving away, 0 is never occupied, so y=1 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=2: same car as y=1, (-60,-25,left,36), so same thing, always safe.\n\nk=2 is same as k=1.\n\nNow y=3: k=3 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12) but for right-moving, span at t=3: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? τ is tail, h is head, so if tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the notation, (head, tail, direction, speed), so for this car, head=-12, tail=-23? But -23 < -12, so tail=-23, head=-12, so left end τ=-23, right end h=-12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-23 +12ΔT, -12 +12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, so span at T: [13 +12ΔT, 24 +12ΔT]\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, span [49 +12ΔT, 60 +12ΔT]\n\nFor y=3, at turn T, 0 in span if for some car, left <=0<=right.\n\nFirst car: -23 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -12 +12ΔT\n\nSolve: -23 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so ΔT <=1 since ΔT integer? T and ΔT are integers, since turns are discrete.\n\nΔT = T - t1 = T-3, integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -12 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span when ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=1.916, so ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=1, left = -23+12= -11, right= -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nIs 0 included? Span is [left, right], and it says \"0 in Span(T)\", so if right=0, then 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, left= -11 <=0, right=0 >=0.\n\nSo at ΔT=1, T=4, 0 is in span for first car.\n\nNow, second car: [13+12ΔT, 24+12ΔT], both ends positive for ΔT>=0, since min left=13>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: [49+12ΔT, 60+12ΔT] >0, not 0.\n\nSo for y=3, unsafe only when first car has 0 in span, which is at T=4 (ΔT=1).\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nAt T=3, ΔT=0, first car span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=4, ΔT=1, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=5, ΔT=2, span [-23+24, -12+24]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, T=6, [13,24], etc.\n\nSo y=3 unsafe at T=4 only? T=4.\n\nNow y=4: same as y=3, since k=4 same cars, so unsafe at T=4 only.\n\nNow y=5: k=5 cars: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, so τ=-47, h=-36, span at T: [-47 +12ΔT, -36 +12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (36,25), head=36, tail=25, span [25+12ΔT, 36+12ΔT]\n\nNow, 0 in span for first car: -47 +12ΔT <=0 <= -36 +12ΔT\n\nLeft: -47+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <=3\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo for ΔT=3, T=6, span: left= -47+36= -11, right= -36+36=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=4: left= -47+48=1, right= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=6.\n\nFor second car: [25+12ΔT,36+12ΔT] >0, never 0.\n\nSo y=5 unsafe at T=6 only.\n\nSimilarly y=6 same as y=5, unsafe at T=6.\n\ny=7 same, unsafe at T=6.\n\nNow y=8: k=8 cars: (60,49,right,4), (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, span at T: [49 +4ΔT, 60 +4ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (12,1), head=12, tail=1, span [1 +4ΔT, 12 +4ΔT]\n\nNow, 0 in span?\n\nFirst car: [49+4ΔT,60+4ΔT] >=49>0 for ΔT>=0, so never 0.\n\nSecond car: [1+4ΔT,12+4ΔT] >=1>0, so always greater than 0, never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for y=8, always safe? At T=3, span [1,12] for second car, which is from 1 to 12, so 0 not included. Similarly, min left is 1, so 0 never covered. So y=8 always safe.\n\nBut let me confirm: at ΔT=0, T=3, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=1, T=4, [5,16], etc., all >0.\n\nFirst car [49,60] etc., >0.\n\nSo yes, y=8 always safe.\n\nNow, y=1 and y=2 always safe, as we said.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe only at T=4\n\ny=5,6,7 unsafe only at T=6\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\ny=9 no freeway, safe.\n\nI start at y=1 at T=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be small if I can go up quickly.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at T=4, and on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nAlso, when I move, I change row at the end of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter action, at the next turn, I am at new position.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, I think? Let's see.\n\nThe game dynamics: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at (0, y_T), and if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on row y_T at time T, then collision.\n\nIf I choose to move at turn T, to a different row, at turn T I am still on y_T, so collision check for y_T at T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and check for that.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so if there is a car on y_{T+1} at T, it doesn't affect me, only when I arrive at T+1.\n\nNow, I start at T=3, y=1.\n\nI need to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can be there any time.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\n- y=3 and y=4 unsafe at T=4\n\n- y=5,6,7 unsafe at T=6\n\n- Other rows and times are safe.\n\ny=1 always safe, y=2 always safe, y=8 always safe.\n\nI am at T=3, y=1.\n\nI can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up, to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, if I am on y=2, y=2 is always safe, so no problem.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=3 at T=5.\n\nT=5, y=3: is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at T=4, at T=5, it should be safe, since only T=4 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=5 should be safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=4 at T=5, then to y=5 at T=6.\n\nBut y=5 at T=6 is unsafe! T=6, y=5 unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go directly:\n\nT=3: y=1, safe\n\nAction U: go to y=2 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=2, safe (since y=2 always safe)\n\nAction U: go to y=3 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=3, now at T=5, y=3 is safe, since unsafe only T=4.\n\nAction U: go to y=4 at T=6\n\nBut at T=6, y=4: but y=4 unsafe at T=6? y=4 unsafe only at T=4, not at T=6.\n\ny=4: unsafe only at T=4, as per earlier.\n\nFor y=4, same as y=3, unsafe at T=4 only.\n\nAt T=6, y=4 should be safe.\n\nBut I am going to y=4 at T=6? Let's see the turn.\n\nAt T=5, I am at y=3.\n\nI choose action, say U, so at the end of T=5, I move to y=4, so at turn T=6, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, at T=6, y=4: is it safe?\n\ny=4 unsafe only at T=4, and at T=6, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 unsafe at T=6, but y=4 is not in that, y=4 is only unsafe at T=4.\n\nSo at T=6, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen from T=6, y=4, I can go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nBut at T=7, y=5: y=5 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=7 it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's list the path:\n\nStart: T=3, y=1\n\nAction U: to y=2 at T=4\n\nT=4, y=2 (safe, since always)\n\nAction U: to y=3 at T=5\n\nT=5, y=3 (safe, since not T=4)\n\nAction U: to y=4 at T=6\n\nT=6, y=4 (safe, since not T=4)\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=5, but at T=6, if I go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nBut at T=6, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at T=7.\n\nNow T=7, y=5: is it safe? y=5 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go U to y=6 at T=8, but y=6 unsafe at T=6, but T=8 is later, safe.\n\nT=7, y=5, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=6 at T=8\n\nT=8, y=6, safe (since unsafe only T=6)\n\nAction U: to y=7 at T=9\n\nT=9, y=7, safe\n\nAction U: to y=8 at T=10\n\nT=10, y=8, always safe\n\nAction U: to y=9 at T=11\n\nThen at T=11, I am at y=9, done.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from start? Let's see.\n\nI start at turn t1=3, position given.\n\nAfter H turns, I should be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=3 to t=3+H-1, and after H actions, I am at turn t=3+H, position y=3+H? Not necessarily.\n\nLet me index.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn T + H, position y_{T+H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at turn t1 + H -1, I move to position at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo, after applying actions from t=0 to H-1, which are at turns t1 + 0 to t1 + H -1, the position at turn t1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at (0,9).\n\nAnd the actions are applied at turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, I apply action a_{t1}, which affects position at t1+1.\n\nBut the position at turn t1 is given, before any action.\n\nStandard: at turn T, I am at position, then I choose action, which determines next position at T+1.\n\nSo position at T+1 depends on action at T.\n\nBut for the target, I need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nAnd actions from turn t1 to t1 + H -1 are taken.\n\nIn this case, t1=3, so I need to be at (0,9) at turn 3 + H -1.\n\nAnd actions at turns 3,4,5,..., up to 3 + H -1.\n\nNow, in my earlier path, I was at:\n\nT=3: y=1\n\nAfter actions, I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn my sequence, if I go up each turn:\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=3, y=1\n\nAction at T=3: U, then T=4, y=2\n\nAction at T=4: U, then T=5, y=3\n\nAction at T=5: U, then T=6, y=4\n\nAction at T=6: U, then T=7, y=5\n\nAction at T=7: U, then T=8, y=6\n\nAction at T=8: U, then T=9, y=7\n\nAction at T=9: U, then T=10, y=8\n\nAction at T=10: U, then T=11, y=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1.\n\nSet 3 + H -1 = 11, so H-1 = 8, H=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1 =11, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nBut I can do better, since some rows I can skip or go faster.\n\ny=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves up, but I might need to stay or something to avoid.\n\nIn this case, with the unsafe times, I might be able to go faster.\n\nFor example, from T=3, y=1, I can go directly to y=2 at T=4.\n\nBut y=2 is safe.\n\nThen from T=4, y=2, I can go to y=3 at T=5.\n\ny=3 at T=5 is safe.\n\nThen from T=5, y=3, I could go to y=4 at T=6.\n\ny=4 at T=6 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen from T=6, y=4, I want to go to y=5, but at T=6, y=5 is unsafe, but I am not on y=5 yet.\n\nIf I go U at T=6, I move to y=5 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, y=5 is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are unsafe only at T=6, but at other times safe, so I can be on them at T=5 or T=7, etc.\n\nFor example, at T=5, I could be on y=4 or y=5.\n\nLet me list the safe times for each row.\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: safe except T=4\n\ny=4: safe except T=4\n\ny=5: safe except T=6\n\ny=6: safe except T=6\n\ny=7: safe except T=6\n\ny=8: always safe\n\nNow, I start at T=3, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn S, and S = t1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1.\n\nMinimal S, or minimal H.\n\nSince I need to increase y from 1 to 9, minimum 8 steps up, so minimum H=8 actions, reaching at turn 3+8=11? Let's see.\n\nAfter k up moves, I go from y to y+k.\n\nStart at y=1, after m moves up, I am at y=1+m.\n\nSet 1+m=9, m=8, so at least 8 up moves.\n\nEach up move takes one turn, so minimum 8 actions to go from y=1 to y=9 with all up.\n\nBut with possible down or stay, it might take more turns, but not less, since I need net +8 in y.\n\nSo minimal number of actions H is at least 8.\n\nIf I can do exactly 8 up moves without collision, H=8, reaching at turn 3+8=11.\n\nBut turn: after H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1 + H = 3 + H.\n\nAnd I need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nt1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to S, where y_S=9.\n\nIn the case of all up, no delay: after action at T=3: to y=2 at T=4\n\n...\n\nAfter action at T=10: to y=9 at T=11\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nI need this at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo 3 + H -1 =11, thus H=9.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see the definition.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I have applied actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and position at turn (t1+H-1) +1 = t1 + H is set, but I need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H -1 is before the action at t1 + H -1? Confusion.\n\nLet me clarify the timeline.\n\n- At turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\n- I choose action a_T.\n\n- Then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\n- Collision check at turn T for position y_T.\n\nThe sequence: starts at turn t1, position given.\n\nI apply actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter applying action at t1 + H -1, the position at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H is determined, but I need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nThat means at the start of turn t1 + H -1, I am at (0,9), and I may or may not take action, but since I reach at that turn, I don't need to take action after that.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t1 only, then after action, position at t1+1 is set, but I need position at t1 to be (0,9), but at t1 I am at start position, not (0,9) unless I start there.\n\nIn this case, I start at (0,1), not (0,9), so for H=1, position at t1=3 is (0,1), not (0,9).\n\nSo I need to have position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9), which requires that I have taken actions to get there.\n\nThe last action is at turn t1 + H -2? Let's think.\n\nSuppose I reach (0,9) at turn S.\n\nThen S = t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn S, I am at (0,9), and since I am there, no need for further action, so the actions are from turn t1 to S-1, because action at T determines position at T+1.\n\nSo to be at y_S at turn S, I need to have taken actions from t1 to S-1.\n\nThe number of actions is from t1 to S-1, so number of turns with actions is (S-1) - t1 + 1 = S - t1.\n\nThen H = S - t1.\n\nBecause actions at t1, t1+1, ..., S-1, that's S - t1 actions.\n\nThen S = t1 + H.\n\nBut S = t1 + H -1 from the problem? Inconsistency.\n\nProblem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so actions at turns t1 +0 to t1 + H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, position at turn (t1 + H-1) +1 = t1 + H is determined.\n\nBut I need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, I am at (0,9), and I have just taken action a_{t1 + H -1}? No.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at position, then I take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which determines y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut for the position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9), it means that before taking action at that turn, I am already at (0,9).\n\nSo I don't necessarily take an action at that turn if I am already there, but in the sequence, I have to specify actions up to when I reach.\n\nIn this setup, the actions include the one that gets me to the position before the turn.\n\nI think there's confusion.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the position at turn T is after any action or before.\n\nStandard in such games: at the beginning of turn T, I am at position P_T, then I choose action a_T, which determines P_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of turn T for P_T.\n\nIn this case, for turn T, position P_T, if on freeway, check collision.\n\nThen action a_T determines P_{T+1}.\n\nI start at turn t1, P_{t1} given.\n\nI need P_S = (0,9) for some S.\n\nThen the actions from turn t1 to S-1 are taken to move from P_{t1} to P_S.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to S-1, that's (S-1) - t1 + 1 = S - t1 actions.\n\nThen S = t1 + H, because H actions cover turns t1 to t1+H-1 for actions, determining P_{t1+1} to P_{t1+H}, and P_{t1} is given.\n\nThen P_S = P_{t1+H} = (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's read the problem exactly.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd in the answer format, it shows actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + something.\n\nAlso, in the car update, it says \"at turn T\", so turn is discrete.\n\nPerhaps for turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9), and the actions are from t1 to t1 + H -1, but if I take action at t1 + H -1, it would affect position at t1 + H, not at t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for position at turn K to be set, it is determined by actions up to K-1.\n\nSo to have position at turn K be (0,9), actions from t1 to K-1 are taken.\n\nThe number of actions is K - t1.\n\nThen K = t1 + H -1 from the problem.\n\nSo position at t1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nThis requires actions from t1 to (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2.\n\nThen the number of actions is (t1 + H -2) - t1 + 1 = H -1.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for a_{t1+t}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut to reach position at t1+H-1, I need actions from t1 to (t1+H-1)-1 = t1+H-2.\n\nSo the actions should be from t1 to t1+H-2, that's H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the turn when I reach is after the last action.\n\nI think there's a mistake in interpretation.\n\nLet me look back.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t=0, action at t1, t=1 at t1+1, ..., t=H-1 at t1+H-1.\n\nAfter taking action at t1+H-1, position at (t1+H-1)+1 = t1+H is set.\n\nBut I need position at t1+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, before taking action, I am at (0,9).\n\nFor that, the actions up to turn t1+H-2 determine position at t1+H-1.\n\nSo the action at t1+H-1 is not needed if I am already at (0,9), but in the sequence, I have to include H actions up to t1+H-1.\n\nBut if at t1+H-1 I am at (0,9), taking an action might move me away, but I can choose S to stay.\n\nBut the point is, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, I must have arrived there by action at t1+H-2 or earlier.\n\nFor the position at turn K to be (0,9), it is determined by the actions before K.\n\nSpecifically, position at turn K is determined by action at K-1 from position at K-1.\n\nSo for P_K to be (0,9), it depends on P_{K-1} and a_{K-1}.\n\nI start with P_{t1} = (0,1).\n\nI need P_S = (0,9) for S = t1 + H -1.\n\nThen for S, P_S = (0,9), which is achieved by actions from turn t1 to S-1.\n\nActions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., S-1.\n\nNumber of actions: (S-1) - t1 + 1 = S - t1.\n\nThen S = t1 + H -1, so S - t1 = H -1.\n\nNumber of actions is H-1.\n\nBut the sequence is given for H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps for the reach turn, it is after the actions.\n\nI think I found the issue.\n\nIn the problem, it says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nBut in the action sequence, when t=0, action at t1, which determines position at t1+1.\n\nPosition at t1 is given, not determined by action.\n\nAfter action at t1, position at t1+1 is set, and so on, up to after action at t1+H-1, position at t1+H is set.\n\nBut I need position at t1+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, I am at (0,9), and this position is determined by the action at t1+H-2 from position at t1+H-2.\n\nFor that to happen, the actions from t1 to t1+H-2 are needed to get to position at t1+H-1.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, I am at (0,9), and I take action a_{t1+H-1}, which determines position at t1+H, but since I am already at (0,9), and I might stay or move, but to reach and stop, I can choose to stay or not take action, but the sequence includes the action at that turn.\n\nIf I am at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and I take action U or D, I move away, which is not desired, so I should take action S to stay, but then I am still at (0,9) at turn t1+H, but I need to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo for the turn when I first reach (0,9), at that turn, I can choose S to stay, but the position is already (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, for the turn when I reach, if I take action S, I stay, so position remains.\n\nBut in the collision, when I am at y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nTo simplify, in this case, since y=9 is safe, I can be there any time.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, I can assume that when I reach (0,9), I stop or stay.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I need to specify actions until I reach.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H means the number of actions to reach, including the one that gets me there.\n\nLet's assume that at turn S, I am at (0,9), and S = t1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions from t1 to S-1 are taken to get from P_t1 to P_S.\n\nNumber of actions: (S-1) - t1 + 1 = S - t1.\n\nThen S = t1 + H -1, so S - t1 = H -1.\n\nH is the number of turns, which includes the reach turn or not.\n\nI think I should look for the smallest S such that I can be at (0,9) at turn S, with S >= t1.\n\nThen H = S - t1 + 1 or something.\n\nLet's define S as the turn when I am at (0,9).\n\nThen the number of actions taken is from turn t1 to S-1, so number of actions is S - t1.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions at t1, t1+1, ..., S-1, so H = S - t1 actions.\n\nThen the reach turn S = t1 + H.\n\nBut in the problem, S = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps in the problem, \"turns H\" includes the start turn or not.\n\nI think I should proceed with the grid and times.\n\nI start at T=3, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nMinimal T when I can be at y=9.\n\nWith all up moves, I can be at y=9 at T=11, as before.\n\nBut I can do better by going faster in some legs.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=3, I can go U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, at T=5, I am at y=3, I can go U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=4, safe, as established.\n\nNow, at T=6, I am at y=4, but I want to go to y=5, but at T=6, y=5 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=5 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nIf I go U at T=6, I move to y=5 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, y=5 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go U to y=6 at T=8, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I can go multiple steps, but I can only change by +1, -1, 0 per turn, so I can only move to adjacent rows or stay.\n\nSo I cannot jump, so minimum 8 moves up.\n\nThe only way to save time is to avoid waiting turns.\n\nIn this case, with the unsafe times, I might not need to wait, as in the path I have, I never need to stay or go down, I can go up every turn from T=3 to T=10, reaching y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start at T=3 y=1, after 7 up moves, I could be at y=8 at T=10, then to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut y=8 at T=10 is safe.\n\nBut at T=3, y=1, after 1 move U at T=3, to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAfter 2 moves, at T=5, y=3.\n\nAfter 3 moves, at T=6, y=4.\n\nAfter 4 moves, at T=7, y=5.\n\nAfter 5 moves, at T=8, y=6.\n\nAfter 6 moves, at T=9, y=7.\n\nAfter 7 moves, at T=10, y=8.\n\nAfter 8 moves, at T=11, y=9.\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 at an earlier turn?\n\nFor example, if I can be on a row at a time when it is safe but closer.\n\nBut since I start from y=1 at T=3, and I need to go to y=9, the earliest I can be at y=9 is T=11 with all up, no delay.\n\nBut at some points, I might go down to avoid and come back, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nOr stay, more turns.\n\nSo with no delays, T=11 is earliest possible for y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if with all up, I have collision.\n\nIn the path:\n\nT=3: y=1, safe\n\nT=4: y=2, safe\n\nT=5: y=3, safe (since unsafe only T=4)\n\nT=6: y=4, safe (unsafe only T=4)\n\nT=7: y=5, safe (unsafe only T=6)\n\nT=8: y=6, safe (unsafe only T=6)\n\nT=9: y=7, safe (unsafe only T=6)\n\nT=10: y=8, safe\n\nT=11: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nAt each turn I am on the row, and it is safe at that turn.\n\nFor example, at T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nT=6, y=4, safe.\n\nT=7, y=5, safe.\n\netc.\n\nSo no collision, and H=8 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from T=3 to T=10, each U, 8 actions.\n\nThen position at T=11 is y=9.\n\nBut I need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nt1=3, H=8, t1 + H -1 = 3+8-1=10.\n\nAt turn 10, what is my position?\n\nAfter actions from T=3 to T=9, position at T=10 is y=8.\n\nThen at turn T=10, I am at y=8, and I take action a_{10}, which is U, to go to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut at turn T=10, I am at (0,8), not (0,9).\n\nI need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1 =10.\n\nSo at turn 10, I should be at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with actions, after action at T=9, I am at y=8 at T=10.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=10, I need to have taken action at T=9 to go to y=9 from y=8, but from y=8 at T=9, action U at T=9 to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, I am at y=9.\n\nSo for that, I need to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nThen action U at T=9 to y=9 at T=10.\n\nSo at turn T=10, I am at (0,9).\n\nThen for this, actions from T=3 to T=9, that's 7 actions: T=3 to T=9.\n\nT=3,4,5,6,7,8,9: 7 actions.\n\nPosition at T=10 is y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =3 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 10, so 3+H-1=10, H=8.\n\nH=8, t1+H-1=3+8-1=10, yes.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1=7, so actions at t1+0=3 to t1+7=10? t from 0 to H-1=7, so actions at t1 + t for t=0 to 7, so turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nBut action at T=10 determines position at T=11, but I need position at T=10 to be (0,9), which is determined by action at T=9.\n\nSo in the sequence, action at T=10 is not necessary for reaching at T=10, but since I am at (0,9) at T=10, I can take action S to stay, so position at T=11 is still (0,9).\n\nBut for the reach, at T=10 I am there.\n\nIn the sequence, for T=10, I can have a_{10} = S, so I stay at y=9.\n\nBut in the path, when I reach, I can stay.\n\nIn this case, to be at y=9 at T=10, I need to be at y=8 at T=9, then U to y=9 at T=10.\n\nSo let's see the timeline.\n\nStart T=3, y=1\n\nAction at T=3: U, to y=2 at T=4\n\nAction at T=4: U, to y=3 at T=5\n\nAction at T=5: U, to y=4 at T=6\n\nAction at T=6: U, to y=5 at T=7\n\nAction at T=7: U, to y=6 at T=8\n\nAction at T=8: U, to y=7 at T=9\n\nAction at T=9: U, to y=8 at T=10? No.\n\nAction at T=9: from y at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, what is y? After action at T=8.\n\nLet's list position at turn T and action at T.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | next y\n\nT=3: y=1, action a3, then y4 = y3 + Δy\n\nBetter:\n\nAt turn T: position y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy\n\nFor T=3: y3=1, choose a3, then y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nT=4: y4, choose a4, then y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\n...\n\nUp to T=S-1: y_{S-1}, choose a_{S-1}, then y_S = y_{S-1} + Δy_{S-1}\n\nI need y_S =9 for S= t1 + H -1\n\nWith t1=3, S=3+H-1\n\nNow, to have y_S=9.\n\nIn the all-up path, if I go up each turn from T=3 to T=9, I can be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nWith 7 actions.\n\nStart: T=3, y=1\n\na3=U, then y4=2\n\nT=4, y=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7, y=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8, y=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9, y=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nNot yet at 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=10, I need y10=9.\n\nFrom above, at T=9, y9=7, if a9=U, y10=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nI need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=9, if I am at y=8, then a9=U to y10=9.\n\nBut how to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nFrom start, T=3 y=1, after 6 up moves, at T=9 y=7? T=3 to T=9 is 6 turns later, but positions: after 0 moves, T=3 y=1; after 1 move, T=4 y=2; after 2 moves, T=5 y=3; after 3 moves, T=6 y=4; after 4 moves, T=7 y=5; after 5 moves, T=8 y=6; after 6 moves, T=9 y=7; after 7 moves, T=10 y=8; after 8 moves, T=11 y=9.\n\nSo to be at y=8 at T=9, I need to have moved faster, but I can't, since only +1 per turn.\n\nMinimum time to go from y=1 to y=8 is 7 moves, to T=10.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=3 to y=8 at T=10 with 7 moves.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=11 with 8th move.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=10, I need from y=1 at T=3 to y=9 at T=10, which requires 7 moves up in 7 turns, but from T=3 to T=10 is 7 turns later, position at T=10 is after 7 actions from T=3 to T=9.\n\nActions at T=3 to T=9 determine y4 to y10.\n\ny10 is determined by action at T=9 from y9.\n\ny9 is determined by action at T=8 from y8, and so on.\n\nTo have y10=9, I need y9 + Δy9 =9, so y9=8 or 9 or 10, but since y=0 to9, y9=8 or 9.\n\nIf y9=8, then U to 9.\n\nIf y9=9, then S to 9.\n\nBut to have y9=8 or 9 at T=9.\n\ny9 at T=9.\n\nFrom start, after 6 actions, at T=9 y=7 if all up.\n\nTo have y9=8, I need to be at y=7 at T=8, then U to y=8 at T=9.\n\nOr at y=8 at T=8, then S to y=9? No, action at T=8 determines y9.\n\nIf at T=8 y=8, a8=S, then y9=8.\n\nThen to have y10=9, a9=U from y9=8 to y10=9.\n\nBut at T=9, I am at y=8, not 9.\n\nI need y10=9.\n\nBut for the position at turn S= t1+H-1=10 to be 9, so y10=9.\n\nTo have y10=9, as above.\n\nEarliest y10=9 is with all up from start, but from above, with actions at T=3 to T=9 all U, y10=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y10=9, I need to be at y=8 or 9 at T=9.\n\nWith all up, at T=9, y=7, so I need an extra move.\n\nFor example, if at some point I move faster, but I can't.\n\nOr start from higher, but I start at y=1.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=9 is T=11 with y11=9.\n\nThen for that, S=11, t1+H-1=3+H-1=11, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 8, turns 3 to 11, but action at T=11 determines y12, not needed.\n\nI think I should accept that with all up, I can reach at T=11 with H=8 actions, but position at T=11.\n\nBut the problem wants position at t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=8, t1+H-1=3+8-1=10, position at T=10 should be (0,9), but in all-up, at T=10, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have at T=10 y=9, I need to be at y=8 at T=9, then U to y=9 at T=10.\n\nAt T=9, y=8.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nFrom start T=3 y=1, after 6 moves: at T=9 y=7, as above.\n\nAfter 5 moves, at T=8 y=6.\n\nNot y=8.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 or 9 at T=9 with start at T=3 y=1.\n\nMinimal time to y=8 is T=10, to y=9 is T=11.\n\nSo for position at S=11, y=9.\n\nThen S=11 = t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1, so 3+H-1=11, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 8, turns 3 to 11, but action at T=11 is not needed for position at T=11, but for position at T=11, it is determined by action at T=10 from y10.\n\nAt T=10, y10, a10, then y11.\n\nIf at T=10 y10=8, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nThen at T=11, y11=9.\n\nFor S=11, position at T=11.\n\nActions to get there are from T=3 to T=10, 8 actions.\n\nThen H=8, S= t1+H-1=3+8-1=10, but at T=10 y10=8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTo resolve, for the reach at turn S, it requires actions from t1 to S-1.\n\nNumber of actions H = S - t1.\n\nThen S = t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says S = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for this problem, I'll assume that with H actions, I reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nThen for y=9 at T=11, H=8, turn 3+8=11.\n\nBut the problem says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps in this context, since the position is at discrete turns, and actions at each turn, I'll proceed with the sequence.\n\nFor this specific case, with all up, I can reach at T=11 with 8 actions.\n\nBut to match the format, I'll list the actions.\n\nPerhaps for this car situation, I can reach earlier by being on different rows at different times.\n\nFor example, at T=3, I am at y=1.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I could stay or something, but that delays.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo I think T=11 is earliest.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nFor that, I need to be at y=8 at T=9 or y=9 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, from start, after 6 moves, y=7 if all up.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at T=9, how?\n\nFor example, if at T=3, I go U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nT=4, y=2, go U to y=3 at T=5.\n\nT=5, y=3, go U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nT=6, y=4, go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7, y=5, go U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8, y=6, go U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nStill y=7 at T=9.\n\nIf at some point I was at higher y, but I start from low.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, I can be at y=8 with 7 moves, or y=9 if I was at y=8 at T=9 and U, but not.\n\nSo minimum reach turn is T=11 for y=9.\n\nWith H=8 actions.\n\nThen for the problem, set S=11, t1+H-1=11, so 3+H-1=11, H=9.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 8, turns 3 to 11.\n\nBut action at T=11 determines y12, so for T=11, I am at y=9, I can choose a11=S to stay, so y12=9.\n\nBut position at T=11 is y=9.\n\nSo in the sequence, I include a11=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, actions at T=3 to T=10 for moving, and at T=11 S to stay, but I reach at T=11.\n\nLet's list the actions for moving.\n\nActions at T=3 to T=10: all U, then at T=11, action S to stay.\n\nBut number of actions H=9.\n\nThen turns: actions at t1 to t1+8=11.\n\nPosition at turn t1+H-1=3+9-1=11, y=9, good.\n\nAnd the actions are for turns 3 to 11.\n\nBut at turn 11, action S.\n\nIn the sequence, it will be fine.\n\nBut for the car avoidance, in this path, it works with no issue.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 9 turns or actions?\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut with 8 actions, I can be at y=9 at T=11, but position at T=10 is y=8, not 9.\n\nSo for the problem requirement, I need H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at T=10.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nHow?\n\nAt T=10, y=9.\n\nThat means at T=9, y must be 8 or 9, and action U or S.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7 or 8, with start.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at T=9, then at T=9 action U to y=10=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nFrom T=3 y=1 to T=9 y=8, that requires net +7 in y in 6 turns (from T=3 to T=9 is 6 actions? Positions: at T=3 after 0 actions, T=4 after 1 action, ..., T=9 after 6 actions.\n\nAfter k actions, position at T=3+k.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at T=9, y=1+ number of U minus number of D.\n\nTo have y=8 at T=9, I need net +7 from y=1, so 7 more U than D, in 6 actions, impossible since 6 actions can have at most net +6 if all U, y=7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, after 7 actions, I can be at y=8 with all U, or less with down, but not higher than 8.\n\nSo y=9 at T=10 impossible.\n\nThus, earliest at T=11 with y=11=9.\n\nWith 8 actions from T=3 to T=10.\n\nThen for the sequence, with H=9 actions including the stay at the end.\n\nBut let's confirm the car avoidance with the path.\n\nIn the path: all actions U from T=3 to T=10, and S at T=11, but position at T=11 is y=9, and action at T=11 is not necessary, but for the sequence.\n\nSince at T=10, I am at y=8, action U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=11, I am at y=9.\n\nFor the action sequence, actions at T=3 to T=10: all U.\n\nThen position at T=11 is y=9.\n\nBut I need position at t1+H-1=3+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\nWith H=8 actions, t1+H-1=3+8-1=10, position at T=10 is y=8, not 9.\n\nWith H=8 actions, turns 3 to 10, position at T=10 is after action at T=9, which is y=8 if all U.\n\nNot 9.\n\nSo to have position at T=10 be y=9, I need different actions.\n\nFor example, at T=9, if I am at y=9, but I can't.\n\nSo it's impossible to have position at T=10 be y=9 with start at T=3 y=1.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible reach at turn is T=11 for y=9.\n\nFor that, with H=8 actions, position at T=11 is y=9.\n\nThen for the problem, set S=11, t1+H-1=11, so 3+H-1=11, H=9.\n\nThen with H=9, actions at turns 3 to 11.\n\nActions at T=3 to T=10: U, and at T=11: S.\n\nThen position at T=11 is y=9.\n\nAnd at each turn, no collision as per earlier.\n\nBut at T=11, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTo save one action, but I can't.\n\nSo for this case, with the car positions, the all-up path works with H=9 actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach with less actions by being on rows at safe times.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=1, safe.\n\nI could go directly to y=2 at T=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, y=2, I can go to y=3 at T=5, safe.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, I can go to y=4 at T=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, I cannot go to y=5 because at T=6 y=5 is unsafe, but when I go U at T=6, I move to y=5 at T=7, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nThen a6=U, to y=5 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, y=5, safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI could at T=6 stay on y=4 or something, but that delays.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nAnother idea: since y=3 and y=4 are unsafe only at T=4, and y=5,6,7 at T=6, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=3, I am at y=1.\n\nI could go U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=2, I could go U to y=3 at T=5.\n\nT=5, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=4 at T=6, I could go directly to y=5, but I can't, only adjacent.\n\nSo I must go to y=4 first.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, a5=U, to y=4 at T=6.\n\nT=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a6=U, to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7, y=5, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at T=8, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=6, since y=5,6,7 unsafe, but I am on y=4, I could stay or go down, but not helpful.\n\nSo the shortest is with 8 up moves, 9 actions including the last stay or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the answer, I can list 8 actions of U from turn 3 to 10, reaching at turn 11.\n\nBut to match the format, I'll use H=9.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since the car on y=8 is always safe, and others have limited unsafe times, but I think I cannot do better.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nBut in the car list, for y=8, it has cars, but we said always safe because the spans don't cover 0.\n\nOn y=8, at T=3, cars: (60,49,right,4) span [49,60], and (12,1,right,4) span [1,12], both not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly for other T.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nSo the path is clear.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, I am at y=9, but for the action, I need to include up to turn t1+H-1=3+H-1.\n\nWith 8 actions, H=8, t1+H-1=3+8-1=10, position at turn 10 should be (0,9), but it is (0,8).\n\nSo I must have a sequence where at turn 10, I am at (0,9).\n\nTo do that, I need to be at y=8 at turn 9, then U at turn 9 to y=9 at turn 10.\n\nBut at turn 9, with start, I can be at y=7, as before.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, for this problem, since I start from y=1, the earliest I can be at y=9 is turn 11.\n\nFor turn 10, I can be at y=8.\n\nBut the target is (0,9), so turn 11 is the earliest.\n\nSo for the answer, I will set H=9, with actions from turn 3 to 11, with a11=S or something.\n\nLet's write the sequence.\n\nSuppose H=9, then actions at turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nPosition at turn t1+H-1=3+9-1=11 should be (0,9).\n\nWith actions: a3 to a10: U, then a11: S.\n\nThen position at T=11 is y=9.\n\nAt T=3: y=1, a3=U, y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, a10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11: y=9, a11=S, y12=9\n\nPosition at T=11 is y=9, good.\n\nAnd collision avoided as before.\n\nWith H=8, I can't have position at T=10 be y=9.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal for this requirement.\n\nPerhaps the 'turns H' includes the start turn.\n\nBut in the action sequence, it starts from t1.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nSo for this case, the sequence is all U from turn 3 to turn 10, and S at turn 11, but at turn 11, I am already at y=9, so a11=S is fine.\n\nBut to save an action, I can have only 8 actions, but then position at T=10 is not 9.\n\nSo I think H=9 is necessary for the format.\n\nPerhaps for the reach at turn S, with S=11, H= S - t1 +1 or something.\n\nI'll go with H=9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nAnd the actions are for turns 3 to 11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the last S.\n\nWith 8 actions, if I end at turn 10 with y=9, but I can't.\n\nSo this is it.\n\nNow for the car on y=8, is there any issue? No, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 6, I am on y=4 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nThen move to y=5 at T=7, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal H.\n\nBut H=9 turns, but with 8 up moves and one stay.\n\nMinimal actions to reach is 8, but with the format, H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 10 with y=9 by starting from a different position, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=3, I am at y=1, but if I stay at T=3, then at T=4 still y=1, then go up, but that delays.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr go down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but then I need to come back, more turns.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U from turn 3 to 10, and S at turn 11.\n\nBut for turn 11, S is not necessary, but to have the position at turn 11, I include it.\n\nIn the sequence, I can have only up to turn 10 with U, and position at turn 11 is 9, but the action at turn 10 is U from y=8 to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen for turn 11, no action needed, but the sequence includes actions up to H-1.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll write the actions as above.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on a freeway row at a turn when a car occupies \\(x=0\\) on that row.\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Times:\n- **Freeway 1 and 2**: Always safe, as the car spans are always left of \\(x=0\\) and moving away.\n- **Freeway 3 and 4**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T=4\\) (i.e., when \\(\\Delta T = T - 3 = 1\\)).\n- **Freeway 5, 6, and 7**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T=6\\) (i.e., when \\(\\Delta T = 3\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Always safe, as the car spans are always right of \\(x=0\\).\n- **y=0 and y=9**: Safe, as they are not freeways.\n\nThe player starts at turn 3 on row \\(y=1\\). The minimal path to \\(y=9\\) requires at least 8 upward moves (net change of +8 in \\(y\\)), but due to the turn-based movement and collision constraints, the earliest turn to reach \\(y=9\\) is turn 11. This is achieved with 8 consecutive \"U\" (up) actions from turn 3 to turn 10, moving the player to \\(y=9\\) at turn 11. An additional \"S\" (stay) action at turn 11 ensures the player remains at (0, 9) for the required turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 9 - 1 = 11\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 3 (current position: \\(y=1\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=2\\) at turn 4. Safe, as \\(y=1\\) is always safe at turn 3.\n- **Turn 4 (position: \\(y=2\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=3\\) at turn 5. Safe, as \\(y=2\\) is always safe at turn 4.\n- **Turn 5 (position: \\(y=3\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=4\\) at turn 6. Safe, as \\(y=3\\) is safe at turn 5 (unsafe only at turn 4).\n- **Turn 6 (position: \\(y=4\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=5\\) at turn 7. Safe, as \\(y=4\\) is safe at turn 6 (unsafe only at turn 4).\n- **Turn 7 (position: \\(y=5\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=6\\) at turn 8. Safe, as \\(y=5\\) is safe at turn 7 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 8 (position: \\(y=6\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=7\\) at turn 9. Safe, as \\(y=6\\) is safe at turn 8 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 9 (position: \\(y=7\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=8\\) at turn 10. Safe, as \\(y=7\\) is safe at turn 9 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 10 (position: \\(y=8\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y=9\\) at turn 11. Safe, as \\(y=8\\) is always safe at turn 10.\n- **Turn 11 (position: \\(y=9\\))**: Action \"S\" keeps the player at \\(y=9\\) for turn 11. Safe, as \\(y=9\\) is not a freeway.\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 9\\) turns (actions from turn 3 to turn 11) and ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 11 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 9 - 1 = 11\\)) with no collisions. No shorter sequence is possible, as reaching \\(y=9\\) before turn 11 is infeasible due to movement constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\, S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on row y. Then at turn T+1, the player will be on row y'. So:\n- At turn T, the player is on row y_T (which is the row after the action of the previous turn, or initial at t1).\n- The action a_T taken at turn T will determine y_{T+1} = y_T + (U: +1, D: -1, S: 0).\n\nWe start at turn 4: y4 = 2.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1 to 8) when at that turn, the freeway has a car that covers x=0.\n\nCar update: \n  Left-moving: [h, τ] at t1, then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: [τ, h] at t1, then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nNote: The car state is given at turn t1=4.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at future turns T (>=4) for each freeway.\n\nLet's denote the current turn as t1=4. Then for a future turn T (>=4), the elapsed time is dT = T - 4.\n\nWe are to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and each car on that freeway, the span at turn T.\n\nWe must avoid being on row k at turn T if there is any car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nGoal: Find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y4=2 to y=9 (which is the goal, and note that row 9 is not a freeway, so no cars) in minimal H.\n\nNote: The player can only be at y in [0,9]. So if at turn T, the player is at y_T=0 and we try to move down, we stay at 0. Similarly, if at 9 and we move up, we stay at 9.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn t1 (turn 4) until the turn when we first reach 9. The turn when we are at 9 is the last turn of the sequence.\n\nLet me write down the car information for each freeway at turn 4:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36) -> direction left means it moves left, so the car is defined as [h, τ] = [48,83]? But note: for left-moving, the head is at 48 and tail at 83? That seems backward because typically the head would be the front. But the update rule says for left-moving: [h, τ] -> [h - s*dT, τ - s*dT]. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] \n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nSo for left-moving, the head is at h and the tail at τ? But in the example for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> the head is 48 and tail 83? That would mean the car extends from 48 to 83? But then moving left, the head moves left? Actually, if the car is moving left, the entire car moves left. \n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, τ] -> [h - s*dT, τ - s*dT]. So if h=48 and τ=83, then at dT=0, the car is from 48 to 83? That's a length of 36? Actually, 83-48=35? \n\nBut the car's speed is 36? That seems inconsistent. Let me check the car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,12). For right-moving: [τ, h] = [-11,0]? Then at dT=0, the car is from -11 to 0? Then moving right: [τ + s*dT, h + s*dT] = [-11+12*dT, 0+12*dT].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*dT, h + s*dT]. So the car at t1 is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h? Then for the car (0,-11,right,12): τ=-11, h=0? Then the car is from -11 to 0? \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \n  Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" -> becomes [τ + s*dT, h + s*dT]. \n\nSo the initial span is [τ, h] meaning the car covers from τ to h? Then for (0,-11,right,12): τ=-11, h=0 -> the car is from -11 to 0? That makes sense: the car is 11 units long? \n\nBut then for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36): h=48, τ=83 -> the car is from 48 to 83? That's 35 units? and speed 36? \n\nIt's okay, we just compute.\n\nNow, we must avoid when the player is on a freeway row at turn T and 0 is in the car's span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 4: y4=2. So we are on freeway 2? But wait: freeways are from 1 to 8. Row 0 and 9 are not freeways. So at turn 4, we are on row 2 (freeway 2). \n\nBut let me check the cars on freeway 2: only one car: (48,83,left,36). We must check if 0 is in the span of that car at turn 4? \n\nAt turn 4 (dT=0): the car on freeway 2: [48,83] for left-moving? So the car is from 48 to 83? 0 is not in [48,83]. So at turn 4, we are safe.\n\nNow, we plan the actions.\n\nWe want to go from y=2 to y=9. The minimal number of moves if no cars would be 7 moves (all U). But we have to avoid the freeways when there is a car at 0.\n\nWe can also move down to 0 to avoid, but that would take extra moves. And we can stay.\n\nWe must simulate the car movements over time.\n\nLet me denote dT = T - 4.\n\nWe are going to simulate for turns T=4,5,6,... until we reach 9.\n\nWe need to know for each freeway and each turn T, whether there is a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe'll compute the car spans for each freeway for each car at each turn T (for T>=4).\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left-moving, h=48, τ=83, s=36.\n  At T: span = [48 - 36*dT, 83 - 36*dT]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [48 - 36*dT, 83 - 36*dT]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars (all right-moving):\n  Car1: τ=-11, h=0, s=12 -> [ -11 + 12*dT, 0 + 12*dT ]\n  Car2: τ=25, h=36, s=12 -> [25 + 12*dT, 36 + 12*dT]\n  Car3: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12 -> [-59+12*dT, -48+12*dT]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars (right-moving):\n  Car1: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12 -> [-35+12*dT, -24+12*dT]\n  Car2: τ=37, h=48, s=12 -> [37+12*dT, 48+12*dT]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars (right-moving, but note speed 4 for both):\n  Car1: τ=-59, h=-48, s=4 -> [-59+4*dT, -48+4*dT]\n  Car2: τ=5, h=16, s=4 -> [5+4*dT, 16+4*dT]\n\nWe are at turn T=4 (dT=0) and y=2.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns. We must avoid being on a freeway row at turn T if 0 is in any car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can try to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the freeways 3 to 8 when they are dangerous.\n\nWe are currently at row 2. We can only move to row 1, 2, or 3 at the next turn (turn 5) by taking D, S, or U.\n\nBut note: at turn T, we are at row y_T. Then we choose an action a_T to determine y_{T+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: we are at y4=2. We choose an action a4.\n\nThen at turn 5: y5 = y4 + (a4: U->+1, D->-1, S->0).\n\nThen at turn 5, we are at y5. Then we choose a5, etc.\n\nWe need to check for each turn T (>=4) the row we are at and whether that row is a freeway (1-8) and if so, check if 0 is in any car span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate until we reach 9.\n\nWe'll try to go up as much as possible, but if a row at a future turn is blocked, we might have to wait or go down.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) to find the minimal steps to reach y=9. The state: (T, y) and we start at (4,2). The actions: U, D, S. We move to (T+1, y') where y' = clamp(y + delta, 0,9). And we must not be in a collision at (T, y) for every state we are in (except when y=0 or y=9, which are safe).\n\nBut note: at the starting turn (4,2): we are at turn 4, row 2 -> we check freeway 2 at turn 4: we already saw 0 not in [48,83] -> safe.\n\nWe then expand to next states.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nLet me compute the dangerous times for each freeway.\n\nWe need to know for each freeway and for each turn T (>=4) whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe'll compute for T from 4 to, say, 20 (we hope it doesn't take more than 20 turns).\n\nFreeway 1: [48-36*dT, 83-36*dT]\n  0 in [48-36*dT, 83-36*dT]?\n  => 48-36*dT <= 0 <= 83-36*dT\n  => Solve:\n      48 - 36*dT <= 0  => dT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 -> dT>=2\n      0 <= 83-36*dT => 36*dT <=83 -> dT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> dT<=2\n  So dT=2: \n      dT=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11] -> 0 in [-24,11] -> yes.\n  dT=1: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not in.\n  dT=0: [48,83] -> no.\n  dT=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So freeway1 is dangerous at dT=2 -> turn T=4+2=6.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1 -> dangerous at turn 6.\n\nFreeway3: three cars.\n\n  Car1: [ -11+12*dT, 0+12*dT ]\n      0 in [ -11+12*dT, 12*dT ]?\n      Conditions: \n        -11+12*dT <= 0 <= 12*dT\n        => 12*dT >=0 -> always true for dT>=0? but we need both:\n        -11+12*dT <=0 => 12*dT<=11 -> dT<=11/12≈0.916 -> dT=0: then [ -11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, at the boundary? \n        But note: the car is defined as [τ, h] for right-moving? and the problem says the span is [τ+s*dT, h+s*dT]. \n        At dT=0: τ=-11, h=0 -> the car is from -11 to 0. So 0 is included? -> dangerous at dT=0? \n        But at turn T=4 (dT=0): we are at row 2, not row 3. So we are not on freeway3 at turn4 -> safe for us at turn4.\n\n        Actually, we must check for each freeway at each turn, but we only care when we are on that freeway.\n\n        So for freeway3: \n          dT=0: car1: [ -11, 0] -> includes 0? yes. So if we are on freeway3 at turn4, we would collide. But we are not.\n\n        Now, when is car1 dangerous?\n          We need 0 in [ -11+12*dT, 12*dT ].\n          => -11+12*dT <= 0 <= 12*dT\n          => 12*dT <= 11 -> dT <= 11/12 -> only dT=0? \n          and 0<=12*dT -> dT>=0 -> so only dT=0? \n\n        But let me check dT=1: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n        dT=0: [ -11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\n        So car1: dangerous only at dT=0 -> turn T=4.\n\n        Car2: [25+12*dT, 36+12*dT] -> 0 in [25+12*dT, 36+12*dT]? \n          We need 25+12*dT <= 0 <= 36+12*dT -> but 25+12*dT>=25>0 -> no solution. So never.\n\n        Car3: [-59+12*dT, -48+12*dT] -> \n          -59+12*dT <= 0 <= -48+12*dT\n          => 12*dT<=48 -> dT<=4\n          and 12*dT>=59 -> dT>=59/12≈4.916 -> no integer dT satisfies. So never.\n\n        So freeway3: only dangerous at dT=0 (turn4) from car1.\n\n        But note: we are at turn4 and freeway3 is dangerous at turn4? yes, but we are not on freeway3 at turn4 (we are on row2) -> safe for us.\n\n        However, if we are on freeway3 at turn4, we would collide. But we are not.\n\n        So for freeway3: dangerous only at turn4? \n\n        Actually, car1: only at dT=0? \n        But what about dT=1? we saw [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        But wait: at dT=0: car1: [ -11,0] -> 0 is included -> dangerous at turn4.\n\n        But at dT=1: [1,12] -> not dangerous.\n\n        However, note that the car is moving right. At dT=0: at turn4, the car is at [-11,0]. Then at dT=1 (turn5): [1,12]. Then at dT=2: [13,24], etc.\n\n        So freeway3: dangerous only at turn4? \n\n        But wait: what if we are on freeway3 at turn4? we collide. But we are not.\n\n        So for planning: if we are at freeway3 at turn4, we collide. But we are not. So we can be on freeway3 at other turns? \n\n        We must avoid being on freeway3 at turn4? but turn4 is the current turn and we are not on it. For future turns, we don't need to avoid freeway3 at turn4 because that turn is passed.\n\n        Actually, we are concerned with the turn we are on. So for freeway3, we only need to worry about turn4? but turn4 is already passed? \n\n        However, note: we are at turn4, and we are about to choose an action for turn4. The next state we consider is turn5. We will never be at turn4 again.\n\n        So for freeway3: the dangerous turn is only turn4? then for future turns (>=5) freeway3 is safe? \n\n        Let me check car1 at dT=0.5? but we are at integer turns. So only integer dT.\n\n        So freeway3: dangerous only at turn4. Therefore, for turns T>=5, freeway3 is safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway4 is same as freeway3 -> dangerous only at turn4.\n\nFreeway5: two cars (right-moving, s=12)\n\n  Car1: [-35+12*dT, -24+12*dT]\n      0 in this interval: \n        -35+12*dT <=0<=-24+12*dT\n        => 12*dT<=24 -> dT<=2\n        and 12*dT>=35 -> dT>=35/12≈2.916 -> no integer dT. -> never.\n\n  Car2: [37+12*dT,48+12*dT] -> \n        37+12*dT <=0<=48+12*dT -> \n        first inequality: 37+12*dT<=0 -> dT<=-37/12 -> impossible. -> never.\n\n  So freeway5: never dangerous.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5 -> never dangerous.\n\nFreeway7: same -> never dangerous.\n\nFreeway8: two cars (right-moving, s=4)\n\n  Car1: [-59+4*dT, -48+4*dT]\n        0 in [-59+4*dT, -48+4*dT]?\n        => -59+4*dT <=0<=-48+4*dT\n        => 4*dT<=48 -> dT<=12\n        and 4*dT>=59 -> dT>=59/4=14.75 -> no integer dT. -> never.\n\n  Car2: [5+4*dT,16+4*dT]\n        0 in [5+4*dT,16+4*dT]?\n        => 5+4*dT<=0<=16+4*dT -> \n        first: 5+4*dT<=0 -> dT<=-5/4 -> impossible.\n\n  So freeway8: never dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the only dangerous freeways are:\n\n  Freeway1: dangerous at turn 6 (dT=2)\n  Freeway2: dangerous at turn 6 (dT=2)\n  Freeway3: dangerous at turn 4 (dT=0) [but we are not on it at turn4, so safe for us at turn4? but we avoid being on freeway3 at turn4? but we are not, so no issue for future? and after turn4, freeway3 is safe]\n  Freeway4: same as 3 -> dangerous only at turn4.\n\nBut note: at turn4, we are on freeway2, which is safe at turn4 (as we saw).\n\nSo the only dangerous times are:\n  Freeway1 at turn6: dangerous\n  Freeway2 at turn6: dangerous\n\nAnd freeway3 and 4 are dangerous only at turn4 (which is the current turn and we are not on them) so they are safe for future.\n\nBut wait: what if we are on freeway1 or freeway2 at turn6? then we collide.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway1 or freeway2 at turn6.\n\nNow, note that freeway1 is row1, freeway2 is row2.\n\nSo we must not be on row1 or row2 at turn6.\n\nWe are at turn4: y4=2.\n\nWe need to plan actions for turn4, turn5, turn6, ... until we reach 9.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTurn4: y4=2 (safe at turn4 because freeway2 is safe at turn4)\n\nWe choose a4.\n\nOptions: U -> y5=3\n         S -> y5=2\n         D -> y5=1\n\nNow, at turn5: we are at y5.\n\nThen at turn5, we must check if y5 is safe? \n  For freeway1: dangerous at turn6, not at turn5? because freeway1: dangerous only at turn6 (dT=2) -> at turn5: dT=1 -> [48-36,83-36]=[12,47] -> safe.\n  For freeway2: same -> safe at turn5.\n  For other freeways: we know freeway3 and 4 are safe at turn5 (only dangerous at turn4) and freeways5-8 are always safe.\n\nSo at turn5, any row is safe? \n\nBut we must also check the freeway corresponding to the row we are on at turn5.\n\nFor example, if we are at row1 at turn5: freeway1 -> at turn5: dT=1 -> [12,47] -> safe.\nRow2: freeway2 -> safe at turn5.\nRow3: freeway3 -> at turn5: dT=1 -> for freeway3: \n        car1: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        other cars: we know safe -> so freeway3 safe at turn5.\nSimilarly, row4: safe.\n\nSo turn5: any row is safe.\n\nThen at turn6: we must avoid row1 and row2 because they are dangerous at turn6.\n\nSo at turn6, we must be at row0 or row3 or above.\n\nBut note: we are at turn4: we choose a4 -> leads to y5 at turn5.\n\nThen at turn5, we choose a5 -> leads to y6 at turn6.\n\nWe must have y6 not in {1,2} at turn6.\n\nWe are at y4=2.\n\nOption 1: a4=U -> y5=3 (at turn5, safe)\n  Then at turn5, we choose a5: \n      U: y6=4 -> safe at turn6 (because row4 is freeway4, but freeway4 is only dangerous at turn4, and at turn6: dT=2 -> freeway4: \n          car1: [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> safe? \n          so freeway4 is safe at turn6 -> so row4 is safe.\n      S: y6=3 -> row3: freeway3 at turn6: \n          car1: [-11+24, 24] = [13,24] -> safe.\n      D: y6=2 -> row2: dangerous at turn6 -> not allowed.\n\n  So from y5=3, we can choose U or S at turn5 to avoid row2 at turn6.\n\n  Then we can go to y6=4 or 3.\n\nOption 2: a4=S -> y5=2 (at turn5, safe)\n  Then at turn5: \n      U: y6=3 -> safe (row3 at turn6: safe)\n      S: y6=2 -> dangerous -> not allowed.\n      D: y6=1 -> dangerous (row1 at turn6) -> not allowed.\n\n  So only U is allowed.\n\n  Then we go to y6=3.\n\nOption 3: a4=D -> y5=1 (at turn5, safe) \n  Then at turn5: \n      U: y6=2 -> dangerous -> not allowed.\n      S: y6=1 -> dangerous -> not allowed.\n      D: y6=0 -> safe (row0 is safe always)\n\n  So we must go down to 0.\n\n  Then we are at y6=0.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of moves to 9.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nOption1: a4=U -> then at turn5, we can go U or S.\n\n  If we go U: \n      turn4: U -> y5=3\n      turn5: U -> y6=4\n      Then from y6=4, we need to get to 9: 5 more steps? (if we go up 5 times: 4->5->6->7->8->9: 5 moves)\n\n      So total turns: from turn4 to turn8 (if we count the turns: at turn4 we start, then turn5, turn6, turn7, turn8, turn9? and at turn9 we are at 9? \n        Actually, the sequence of actions: \n          turn4: U -> to 3 (at turn5)\n          turn5: U -> to 4 (at turn6)\n          turn6: U -> to 5 (at turn7)\n          turn7: U -> to 6 (at turn8)\n          turn8: U -> to 7 (at turn9)\n          turn9: U -> to 8 (at turn10)\n          turn10: U -> to 9 (at turn11) -> that's 7 actions? \n\n      But wait: we are at turn4: y4=2.\n        After a4 (turn4): at turn5, y5=3.\n        After a5 (turn5): at turn6, y6=4.\n        After a6 (turn6): at turn7, y7=5.\n        After a7 (turn7): at turn8, y8=6.\n        After a8 (turn8): at turn9, y9=7.\n        After a9 (turn9): at turn10, y10=8.\n        After a10 (turn10): at turn11, y11=9.\n\n      So 7 actions? But we only need to go from 4 to 9: 5 steps? \n\n      Actually, from row4 to row9: we need 5 moves up. But we are starting the moves at turn6 (when we are at row4). \n\n        turn6: we are at row4 -> we do U at turn6 -> row5 at turn7.\n        turn7: U -> row6 at turn8.\n        turn8: U -> row7 at turn9.\n        turn9: U -> row8 at turn10.\n        turn10: U -> row9 at turn11.\n\n      So 5 moves from turn6 to turn10 -> total actions: from turn4 to turn10: 7 actions? \n\n      But we have two actions already: turn4 and turn5. Then from turn6 to turn10: 5 actions -> total 7 actions? \n\n      Actually, the number of actions H is the number of moves. We start at turn4 and we do actions at turn4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -> 7 actions to reach at turn11: y11=9.\n\n      But we want to minimize H.\n\n  Alternatively, from y6=4, we could do more than one U per turn? but no, only one per turn.\n\n  What if we do U as much as possible? \n\n  But we have to avoid any dangerous rows at the time? but we determined that only row1 and row2 are dangerous at turn6, and after that, no danger? \n\n  However, we must check: at turn7, we are at row5 (if we go up from row4 at turn6). \n      Freeway5: we said always safe? yes.\n\n  Similarly, row6,7,8: safe.\n\n  So we can go straight up from row4 to row9 in 5 moves.\n\n  So total moves: 2 (from turn4 and turn5) to get to row4 at turn6, then 5 moves: total 7.\n\n  If at turn5 we choose S instead of U: \n      turn4: U -> y5=3\n      turn5: S -> y6=3\n      Then from row3 at turn6: we are safe? because row3 is freeway3, but we said freeway3 is safe at turn6? \n          At turn6: freeway3: \n            car1: [ -11+12*2, 0+12*2] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\n      Then from row3 at turn6, we can go up: \n          turn6: U -> y7=4\n          turn7: U -> y8=5\n          turn8: U -> y9=6\n          turn9: U -> y10=7\n          turn10: U -> y11=8\n          turn11: U -> y12=9 -> 8 moves? (from turn4 to turn11: 8 actions)\n\n      Worse.\n\n  So from option1: best is 7 moves: \n        turn4: U\n        turn5: U\n        then 5 U's: turn6:U, turn7:U, turn8:U, turn9:U, turn10:U -> but that would make us at turn11 at row9.\n\n      Actually, we do 7 actions: at turn4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\n      The last action at turn10: we move to row9 at turn11.\n\n      So H=7.\n\nOption2: a4=S -> then at turn5: we must go U -> y6=3 (safe at turn6)\n      Then from y6=3: we need to go to 9: 6 moves? \n          turn6: U -> 4\n          turn7: U ->5\n          turn8: U->6\n          turn9: U->7\n          turn10: U->8\n          turn11: U->9 -> 6 moves from turn6 to turn11? \n\n      But we have already done two moves (turn4: S, turn5: U) -> total 8 moves? \n          turn4: S -> at turn5: y5=2\n          turn5: U -> at turn6: y6=3\n          then turn6 to turn11: 6 moves -> total 8 actions.\n\n      Worse than 7.\n\nOption3: a4=D -> y5=1 (safe at turn5) \n      Then at turn5: we must go D -> y6=0 (safe at turn6, because row0 is safe)\n      Then from row0 at turn6: \n          We can go U: to row1 at turn7.\n          But at turn7: row1: freeway1? \n              freeway1 at turn7: dT=3 -> [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe? \n          So we can go up.\n\n          But we have to avoid row1 and row2 at turn6? we are not at turn6. At turn6 we are at 0.\n\n          Then we can go up: \n            turn6: U -> y7=1 (at turn7: safe, as above)\n            turn7: U -> y8=2 (at turn8: freeway2 at turn8: dT=4 -> [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe)\n            then continue: \n            turn8: U->3\n            turn9: U->4\n            ... until 9.\n\n          How many from row0? \n            row0->1: turn6:U (to1 at turn7)\n            turn7:U->2 at turn8\n            turn8:U->3 at turn9\n            turn9:U->4 at turn10\n            turn10:U->5 at turn11\n            turn11:U->6 at turn12\n            turn12:U->7 at turn13\n            turn13:U->8 at turn14\n            turn14:U->9 at turn15 -> that's 11 moves? \n\n          But we have already done two moves (turn4:D, turn5:D) -> total 13 moves? \n\n      This is too long.\n\nTherefore, the best so far is option1: 7 moves.\n\nBut is there a way to do in less than 7?\n\nWe start at row2 at turn4.\n\nWe must be at row>=3 at turn6 to avoid row1 and row2 at turn6.\n\nThe minimal moves: we need to gain at least 1 row by turn6 (from row2 to row3) to be safe.\n\nBut we can do:\n\n  turn4: U -> to row3 at turn5\n  turn5: U -> to row4 at turn6 -> safe.\n\nThen from row4 at turn6, we need 5 more moves to get to row9: that's 5 moves -> total 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, can we get to row5 by turn6? \n\n  turn4: U -> row3 at turn5\n  turn5: U -> row4 at turn6 -> that's row4, not row5.\n\n  To get to row5 at turn6: \n      turn4: U -> row3 at turn5\n      turn5: U -> row4 at turn6? then at turn6 we are at row4, not row5.\n\n  We cannot get to row5 at turn6 because we start at row2 and we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo minimal from row2 to row4: 2 moves, then to row9: 5 moves -> total 7.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to get to row9 faster? \n\nWhat if we go up twice to row4 at turn6, then we are at row4. Then we need 5 moves to row9: that takes 5 more turns -> total 7 turns.\n\nBut note: we are at turn4. We do 7 actions: at turn4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -> then at turn11 we are at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions from turn t1 (4) for t=0 to H-1. So H=7.\n\nBut let me check if we can skip some moves? \n\nAlternatively, what if we go up three times in a row? \n\n  turn4: U -> row3 at turn5\n  turn5: U -> row4 at turn6\n  turn6: U -> row5 at turn7\n  turn7: U -> row6 at turn8\n  turn8: U -> row7 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> row8 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> row9 at turn11 -> that's 7 moves.\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut note: we are safe at every step? \n\nWe need to check for each turn and the row we are at:\n\nTurn4: row2 -> safe (as computed)\nTurn5: row3 -> freeway3: at turn5: dT=1 -> [1,12] -> safe? because 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\nTurn6: row4 -> freeway4: at turn6: dT=2 -> car1: [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> safe.\nTurn7: row5 -> freeway5: safe always -> safe.\nTurn8: row6 -> safe always.\nTurn9: row7 -> safe always.\nTurn10: row8 -> freeway8: safe always -> safe.\nTurn11: row9 -> safe (goal).\n\nSo the sequence is: \n  turn4: U\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n\nBut wait: at turn6, we are at row4, and we do U to go to row5 at turn7. But we have to avoid row1 and row2 at turn6: we are at row4 -> safe.\n\nBut is there a way to do 6 moves? \n\nWe need to reach row9 from row2: 7 rows above? so minimal 7 moves? \n\nActually, from row2 to row9: we need to go up 7 times? because 9-2=7? \n\nBut we start at row2. After one U: row3, then row4, then row5, then row6, then row7, then row8, then row9: 7 moves.\n\nSo minimal moves is 7? \n\nBut what if we go down? that would take more.\n\nSo 7 moves is minimal.\n\nBut we have the constraint: we must avoid row1 and row2 at turn6. And we are doing U at turn4 and turn5: so we are at row4 at turn6 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence of 7 U's is safe? \n\nBut wait: at turn6, we are at row4, but we are about to do an action at turn6. The action at turn6 will move us to row5 at turn7. \n\nBut we are safe at turn6 on row4.\n\nSo the sequence: all U from turn4 to turn10.\n\nBut let me check turn by turn:\n\n  Turn4: a4=U -> then at turn5, we are at row3.\n  Turn5: a5=U -> at turn6, we are at row4.\n  Turn6: a6=U -> at turn7, row5.\n  Turn7: a7=U -> row6 at turn8.\n  Turn8: a8=U -> row7 at turn9.\n  Turn9: a9=U -> row8 at turn10.\n  Turn10: a10=U -> row9 at turn11.\n\nBut we are required to reach at the last action: so at turn10, we do the last action and then at turn11 we are at row9.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nBut note: we must avoid being on row1 or row2 at turn6: we are at row4 -> safe.\n\nBut what about other turns? \n\nAt turn5: we are at row3 -> freeway3: at turn5: dT=1 -> car1: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt turn4: safe.\n\nAt turn6: row4 -> freeway4: at turn6: dT=2 -> car1: [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen the rest are safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". We have H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 6 moves? \n\nSuppose we try to go faster? \n\nWe start at row2 at turn4.\n\nIf we do U at turn4: to row3 at turn5.\n\nThen at turn5, if we do U: to row4 at turn6.\n\nThen we are at row4 at turn6. Then we need to get to row9: 5 moves -> total 7 moves.\n\nBut if we could get to row5 at turn6, then we would only need 4 moves to row9 -> total 6 moves.\n\nHow to get to row5 at turn6? \n  We need to move up 3 times in two turns? impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the fact that row0 and row9 are safe and skip the dangerous rows at turn6 by being at row0 or row9 at turn6.\n\nBut to get to row9 at turn6: \n  from row2: we need 7 moves in 2 turns? impossible.\n\nTo get to row0 at turn6: \n  we go down: \n    turn4: D -> row1 at turn5\n    turn5: D -> row0 at turn6 -> safe at turn6? \n        But then from row0 we need to go to row9: 9 moves? total 9 moves? worse.\n\nSo minimal is 7 moves.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is 7 U's.\n\nBut let me write the actions:\n\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere t1=4, so:\n\na4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10.\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check: at turn6, we are at row4. Is that safe? \n\nAt turn6: dT = 6-4=2.\n\nFreeway4: \n  Car1: [ -11 + 12*2, 0 + 12*2] = [13,24] -> safe.\n  Car2: [25+12*2, 36+12*2] = [49,60] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAnd freeway1 and 2 at turn6: we are not on them.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are on row4 at turn6: which is freeway4, but we checked freeway4 at turn6 and it is safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7 moves of U.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the optimal sequence of actions consists of moving upward (\\(U\\)) for 7 consecutive turns. This sequence ensures the player avoids dangerous positions at critical turns, specifically the hazardous conditions on freeways 1 and 2 at turn 6.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initial state (turn 4):** Player at \\((0, 2)\\).\n- **Action sequence:** All actions are \\(U\\) (upward), increasing the player's \\(y\\)-coordinate by 1 each turn.\n- **Path:**\n  - Turn 4: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5.\n  - Turn 5: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6.\n  - Turn 6: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n  - Turn 7: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n  - Turn 8: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n  - Turn 9: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n  - Turn 10: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- **Collision avoidance:**\n  - **Turn 4:** Player at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). Cars on freeway 2 at turn 4: span \\([48, 83]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n  - **Turn 5:** Player at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Cars on freeway 3 at turn 5: \n    - Car 1: \\([-11 + 12 \\times 1, 0 + 12 \\times 1] = [1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.\n    - Other cars: no span contains 0 → safe.\n  - **Turn 6:** Player at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Cars on freeway 4 at turn 6:\n    - Car 1: \\([-11 + 12 \\times 2, 0 + 12 \\times 2] = [13, 24]\\), 0 not in span.\n    - Other cars: no span contains 0 → safe.\n    - Freeways 1 and 2 are dangerous at turn 6 (spans include 0), but player is at \\(y = 4\\) → avoids collision.\n  - **Turns 7–10:** Player moves through \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) (freeways 5–8). These freeways are always safe (no car spans contain 0 at any turn).\n  - **Turn 11:** Player at \\(y = 9\\) (goal, not a freeway) → safe.\n- **Minimal turns:** The sequence requires 7 actions (\\(H = 7\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. Fewer than 7 moves is impossible, as the player must ascend 7 rows (from 2 to 9), and the constraint at turn 6 necessitates being at \\(y \\geq 3\\) by turn 6, which is satisfied.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 5 and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, and k between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway k.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T and on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So if we move at turn T, we are not on the next freeway until the next turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=5. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction: \n- left-moving: the car moves to the left (decreasing x). The span at time t1 is [h, τ] (if h>τ then it's actually [τ, h] but the update rule uses the head and tail in the given order? Let me read the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at time T, [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: if h is the head and the car is left-moving, then typically h > τ (because as it moves left, the head is at a higher x than the tail). However, the problem states the span as [h, τ] and then updates both by subtracting s*(T-t1). So we must interpret the span as an interval that moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the head is at the right end.\n\nBut note: the given car data might have head and tail in arbitrary order? Actually, the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for left-moving, the head is at the higher x? Actually, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the leftmost? No: if the car is moving left, then the head should be the one that is more to the right? Because when moving left, the car extends from the head (rightmost) to the tail (leftmost). But the problem writes [h, τ] for left-moving. However, in the update, both are subtracted by s*(T-t1), so the entire car moves left. Similarly, for right-moving, the entire car moves right.\n\nBut the problem defines the span for left-moving as [h, τ] and then updates both by subtracting. This implies that h and τ are the positions at time t1. However, the collision condition is that the player's x=0 is in the span at time T.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car the times when the car covers x=0.\n\nHowever, note that we are starting at turn 5 and we are going to simulate future turns.\n\nLet me write down the car data:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (12, 47, left, 36) -> left-moving. But wait: 12 and 47? 12 < 47? Then the span at t1=5 is [12,47]. But if the car is moving left, then at time T, the span becomes [12 - 36*(T-5), 47 - 36*(T-5)].\n\nBut note: the car is 35 units long? (47-12=35). And it moves left at 36 per turn? That's very fast.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  (12, 1, right, 12) -> right-moving: so at t1=5, span is [1,12]? But the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] = [1,12]? Then at time T: [1 + 12*(T-5), 12 + 12*(T-5)]\n  (48, 37, right, 12) -> [37,48] at t1=5? Then becomes [37+12*(T-5), 48+12*(T-5)]\n  (-36, -47, right, 12) -> [-47,-36] at t1=5? Then becomes [-47+12*(T-5), -36+12*(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  (-12, -23, right, 12) -> [-23,-12] at t1=5 → becomes [-23+12*(T-5), -12+12*(T-5)]\n  (60, 49, right, 12) -> [49,60] → [49+12*(T-5), 60+12*(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  (-44, -55, right, 4) -> [-55,-44] → becomes [-55+4*(T-5), -44+4*(T-5)]\n  (20,9,right,4) -> [9,20] → [9+4*(T-5), 20+4*(T-5)]\n\nOur goal: we start at y=3 (turn 5). We want to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid being on a freeway k (for k=1..8) at a turn T when there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nNote: the player is at x=0 always.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn 5 (t1=5) for H turns until we reach y=9. We want minimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=3 and need to get to y=9, we must go up at least 6 times. However, we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns. We need to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (>=5) the set of freeways that are dangerous (i.e., if the player is on that freeway at that turn, then collision).\n\nBut note: the cars on each freeway are independent.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (from 5 onwards) whether the freeway k is blocked at turn T (i.e., there is at least one car on freeway k at turn T that covers x=0).\n\nBut note: the cars are moving, so we need to check for each car on that freeway if 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nLet me compute the blocking times for each freeway.\n\nWe define a function blocked(k, T) that returns True if at turn T, freeway k has a car that covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left-moving, span at T: [12 - 36*(T-5), 47 - 36*(T-5)]\nWe need 0 to be in [A, B] where A = 12 - 36*(T-5), B=47 - 36*(T-5). Since the car is moving left and the span is [A,B] and note that A = 12 - 36*(T-5) and B = 47 - 36*(T-5), and since 12<47, then A < B. So the condition is A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSolve:\n12 - 36*(T-5) <= 0 <= 47 - 36*(T-5)\n\nFirst inequality: 12 <= 36*(T-5)  => (T-5) >= 12/36 = 1/3 => T >= 5 + 1/3 -> so T>=6 (since T integer) -> T>=6\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36*(T-5) => 36*(T-5) <= 47 => T-5 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3055 => T<= 5+1.3055 -> T<=6.3055 -> so T<=6.\n\nTherefore, only at T=6: \n  At T=6: A = 12 - 36 = -24, B=47-36=11 -> then 0 is between -24 and 11 -> yes, blocked.\n\nSo freeway 1 is blocked only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1 -> blocked only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars.\n\nCar1: (12,1,right,12) -> at T: [1 + 12*(T-5), 12 + 12*(T-5)]\nCondition: 1 + 12*(T-5) <= 0 <= 12 + 12*(T-5)\nFirst: 1+12*(T-5) <=0 => 12*(T-5) <= -1 => T-5 <= -1/12 -> T<=5-1/12 -> T<5 -> never at T>=5.\nSecond inequality: 0<=12+12*(T-5) -> always true for T>=5? But the first condition fails. So this car never covers 0.\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-5), 48+12*(T-5)]\nCondition: 37+12*(T-5) <=0<=48+12*(T-5)\nFirst: 37+12*(T-5)<=0 -> 12*(T-5)<=-37 -> T-5<=-37/12≈-3.08 -> T<=1.92 -> never for T>=5.\nSecond: 0<=48+12*(T-5) -> always true for T>=5. But first fails.\n\nCar3: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12*(T-5), -36+12*(T-5)]\nCondition: -47+12*(T-5) <=0<= -36+12*(T-5)\n\nFirst: -47+12*(T-5)<=0 -> 12*(T-5)<=47 -> T-5<=47/12≈3.916 -> T<=8.916 -> T<=8 (integer)\nSecond: 0<=-36+12*(T-5) -> 12*(T-5)>=36 -> T-5>=3 -> T>=8.\n\nSo T must be in [8,8.916] -> T=8.\n\nCheck T=8: \n  A = -47+12*(3) = -47+36 = -11\n  B = -36+12*(3) = -36+36=0\n  Then the interval is [-11,0]. So 0 is included? Note: the interval is closed? The problem says \"0 in Span\", and at T=8: the car covers from -11 to 0. So 0 is the right endpoint. Since the span is [A,B] and 0=B, then yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nTherefore, freeway 3 is blocked at T=8.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3 -> blocked at T=8.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nCar1: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+12*(T-5), -12+12*(T-5)]\nCondition: -23+12*(T-5) <=0<= -12+12*(T-5)\n\nFirst: -23+12*(T-5)<=0 -> 12*(T-5)<=23 -> T-5<=23/12≈1.916 -> T<=6.916 -> T<=6\nSecond: 0<=-12+12*(T-5) -> 12*(T-5)>=12 -> T-5>=1 -> T>=6.\n\nSo T=6: \n  A = -23+12*(1) = -11\n  B = -12+12*(1)=0\n  So interval [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\nCar2: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(T-5), 60+12*(T-5)]\nCondition: 49+12*(T-5)<=0<=60+12*(T-5)\nFirst: 49+12*(T-5)<=0 -> 12*(T-5)<=-49 -> T-5<=-49/12≈-4.08 -> T<=0.92 -> never for T>=5.\n\nSo freeway 5 is blocked only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5 -> blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5 -> blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nCar1: (-44,-55,right,4) -> [-55+4*(T-5), -44+4*(T-5)]\nCondition: -55+4*(T-5)<=0<=-44+4*(T-5)\n\nFirst: -55+4*(T-5)<=0 -> 4*(T-5)<=55 -> T-5<=55/4=13.75 -> T<=18.75 -> T<=18\nSecond: 0<=-44+4*(T-5) -> 4*(T-5)>=44 -> T-5>=11 -> T>=16.\n\nSo T in [16,18] -> T=16,17,18.\n\nCheck T=16: A=-55+4*(11)= -55+44=-11, B=-44+44=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 included.\nT=17: A=-55+4*12=-55+48=-7, B=-44+48=4 -> [-7,4] -> 0 included.\nT=18: A=-55+4*13=-55+52=-3, B=-44+52=8 -> [-3,8] -> 0 included.\n\nCar2: (20,9,right,4) -> [9+4*(T-5), 20+4*(T-5)]\nCondition: 9+4*(T-5)<=0<=20+4*(T-5)\nFirst: 9+4*(T-5)<=0 -> 4*(T-5)<=-9 -> T-5<=-9/4=-2.25 -> T<=2.75 -> never for T>=5.\n\nSo freeway 8 is blocked at T=16,17,18.\n\nSummary of blocked freeways by turn:\n\nTurn 5: \n  We are at y=3. Check freeway 3: not blocked (only at 8). Freeway 4,5,6,7,8: not blocked at 5? \n  But note: we are at turn 5, so we check the cars at turn 5? However, the player is at (0,3) at turn 5. So we must check freeway 3 at turn 5: \n    freeway3: cars: \n      car1: [1+12*0, 12+12*0] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]\n      car2: [37,48] -> 0 not in\n      car3: [-47,-36] -> 0 not in\n    so freeway3 is safe at 5.\n  Similarly, freeway4 same as 3 -> safe.\n  freeway5: \n      car1: [-23,-12] -> 0 not in\n      car2: [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  freeway6,7 same as 5 -> safe.\n  freeway8: \n      car1: [-55,-44] -> safe\n      car2: [9,20] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn5, we are safe at y=3.\n\nBut we are going to simulate turns.\n\nBlocking schedule:\n\nTurn 6: \n  freeway1: blocked\n  freeway2: blocked\n  freeway5: blocked\n  freeway6: blocked\n  freeway7: blocked\n  Others: freeway3,4,8: not blocked (freeway3 blocked at 8, freeway8 blocked from 16 to 18)\n\nTurn 7: \n  freeway1: not blocked (only at 6) -> safe\n  freeway2: safe\n  freeway3: safe (blocked at 8) -> safe\n  freeway4: safe\n  freeway5: safe (only at 6) -> safe\n  freeway6: safe\n  freeway7: safe\n  freeway8: safe (blocked from 16)\n\nTurn 8:\n  freeway3: blocked\n  freeway4: blocked\n  freeway5: safe\n  freeway8: safe (until 16)\n  Others: safe\n\nTurns 9-15: no blocking? \n  freeway1: only 6\n  freeway2: only 6\n  freeway3,4: only 8\n  freeway5,6,7: only 6\n  freeway8: starting at 16\n\nSo turns 9-15: all freeways are safe.\n\nTurn 16,17,18: freeway8 blocked.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3.\n\nWe must get to y=9. The minimal number of moves if we only go up: 6 moves (so 6 turns). But we have to avoid the blocked freeways.\n\nWe are at turn5 at y=3. We are safe at turn5.\n\nNow, if we try to go up as fast as possible:\n\nTurn5: at y=3 -> safe.\n\nTurn6: we are going to move at turn5: action a5. \n\nIf we go up at turn5: then at turn6 we are at y=4.\nBut at turn6, we are at freeway4? No: at turn5 we are at y=3. Then we move up: so at turn6 we are at y=4.\n\nBut note: at turn6, we are on freeway4? \n  - At turn5, we are at freeway3? Actually, at turn5 we are at (0,3) -> so freeway3? \n  - But the freeway numbers correspond to the y-coordinate? Yes: the freeways are at y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo at turn5: y=3 -> we are on freeway3? But freeway3 is at y=3? Actually, the problem says freeways y=1,...,8. So when the player is at (0, y), then if y is between 1 and 8, they are on freeway y.\n\nSo at turn5: we are at y=3 -> freeway3.\n\nAt turn6: we are at y=4 -> freeway4.\n\nNow, at turn6: \n  freeway4 is safe? But our summary says at turn6: freeway4 is not blocked (only freeway1,2,5,6,7 are blocked). \n  But wait: our summary for freeway4: we said freeway4 is blocked only at T=8. So at turn6, freeway4 is safe.\n\nSo if we go up at turn5: \n  turn5: action U -> at turn6: y=4 -> freeway4 is safe.\n\nThen at turn6: we can go up again: \n  turn6: action U -> at turn7: y=5 -> freeway5.\n\nAt turn7: freeway5 is safe? Our summary: freeway5 is blocked at turn6, but not at turn7 -> so safe.\n\nThen at turn7: U -> turn8: y=6 -> freeway6.\n\nAt turn8: freeway6 is safe? (only blocked at turn6) -> safe.\n\nThen at turn8: U -> turn9: y=7 -> freeway7: safe (only blocked at turn6).\n\nAt turn9: U -> turn10: y=8 -> freeway8.\n\nAt turn10: freeway8 is safe? (blocked at 16,17,18) -> safe.\n\nAt turn10: U -> turn11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: from turn5 to turn11: 6 moves (actions) and 6 turns of movement? Actually:\n\nWe start at turn5: we take 6 actions: at turn5, turn6, turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10. Then at turn11 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: the position after an action: \n  At turn5: we start at y3. Then we do an action at turn5: \n      turn5: action U -> at the end of turn5, we move to y4? \n  But the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo after turn5 (action at turn5), we are at y4 at the beginning of turn6? \n\nThe problem says: \"at turn T, the player is at y_T\". And then we choose an action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at the start of turn5: we are at (0,3). Then we choose a5. Then at the start of turn6: we are at (0, y6) = (0, 3 + Δy5).\n\nTherefore, we are at the goal when at the start of turn T we are at y=9.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the start of turn (t1 + H) for some H. But note: we are starting at turn5 (t1=5) and we are at y=3. Then we take H actions: at turns 5, 6, ..., 5+H-1. Then at the start of turn 5+H, we are at the position after the last action.\n\nWe want that at the start of turn (5+H) we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\n  Start turn5: y5=3 -> action U -> then at turn6: y6=4.\n  turn6: U -> turn7: y7=5.\n  turn7: U -> turn8: y8=6.\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y9=7.\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y10=8.\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y11=9.\n\nSo at the start of turn11, we are at y=9. So H = 6 (we take 6 actions: at turns5 to turn10). Then the minimal H is 6? \n\nBut we must check that we never collide. We are at:\n\n  turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3: safe (as we checked above).\n  turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4: safe (since freeway4 is blocked only at turn8).\n  turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5: safe (blocked only at turn6, and we are at turn7 -> safe).\n  turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6: safe (blocked at turn6, not at turn8).\n  turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7: safe (blocked only at turn6).\n  turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8: safe (blocked at 16,17,18, and we are at turn10).\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, and the actions are all U.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps required. So minimal H is 6.\n\nBut what if we use down or stay? That would only make H larger. So we have a solution.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait: at turn5 we are at y=3 and we do U -> at turn6 we are at y=4. Then we do U at turn6 -> at turn7 at y=5, etc.\n\nBut we must check if there is any collision at the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nWe already did: at turn5: freeway3 is safe, turn6: freeway4 is safe, etc.\n\nBut note: at turn6, we are at freeway4. And we said freeway4 is safe at turn6. But let me double-check freeway4 at turn6.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? Actually, no: freeway4 has the same cars as freeway3? The table says freeway4 has the same set of cars as freeway3: \n  (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nAt turn6 (T=6): \n  car1: [1+12*(1)=13, 12+12=24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> not.\n  car3: [-47+12=-35, -36+12=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo indeed safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at turn7 (T=7): \n  car1: [-23+12*(2)= -23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [49+24=73, 60+24=84] -> not.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6 and the sequence is U repeated 6 times.\n\nBut note: we start at turn5 and we do 6 actions: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10. Then at turn11 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence for turns starting at t1 (which is 5) and for H turns? The answer format: \n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nSo for H=6, we have actions at t1=5, t1+1=6, ..., t1+5=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut is there a problem at turn8? We are at freeway6 at turn8? But freeway6 is safe at turn8. \n\nHowever, note that at turn8, freeway3 and 4 are blocked. But we are at freeway6, which is safe.\n\nSo it's okay.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We cannot because we need 6 moves.\n\nAlternatively, could we go down? That would only make it longer.\n\nSo we have the minimal.\n\nBut note: we might consider if we can avoid the blocked freeways by waiting? But we don't need to wait because we can go straight through without hitting any blocked freeway.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me check if at turn8 we are at freeway6: yes, because we did U at turn7 (from y5 to y6) so at turn8 we are at y6 -> freeway6.\n\nAnd freeway6 is not blocked at turn8: only at turn6.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns is 6.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and H is the number of actions? And then we have H actions. And we end at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then a sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1? \n\nBut then the player position at turn t1+H is (0,9). \n\nWe have:\n\n  After H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1), the player position at turn t1+H is (0,9).\n\nIn our case: \n  Start at turn5: y5=3.\n  After 1st action (turn5): y6 = 3+1 =4.\n  After 2nd: y7=5.\n  After 3rd: y8=6.\n  After 4th: y9=7.\n  After 5th: y10=8.\n  After 6th: y11=9.\n\nSo we need H=6, and we are at turn5+6 = turn11 at (0,9).\n\nSo the sequence is for t=0 to 5 (i.e., H=6 actions).\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t=0: a_{t1+0}=a5, t=1: a6, ... t=5: a10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait, what about the cars on freeway8 at later turns? We don't go there until turn10, and we leave freeway8 by moving up to y9 at turn10? \n\nAt turn10: we are at y8 (freeway8) at the start of the turn. Then we do an action U at turn10, which moves us to y9 at the start of turn11.\n\nAt turn10: we are at freeway8. Is freeway8 safe at turn10? \n  We computed freeway8 is blocked at turns 16,17,18. Turn10 is before 16 -> safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check freeway8 at turn10:\n\nCar1: [-55+4*(10-5)= -55+20 = -35, -44+20=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\nCar2: [9+4*5=9+20=29, 20+20=40] -> [29,40] -> 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is correct.\n\nBut note: what if we try to go faster? We cannot because we must go up 6 times.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up 5 times and then one more? But no, we start at 3 and need to get to 9: difference 6.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Blocked Freeways\nThe blocking status of each freeway at each turn is determined by checking if any car on that freeway covers \\(x = 0\\) at the given turn. The summary of blocked freeways is:\n- **Turn 6**: Freeways 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 are blocked.\n- **Turn 8**: Freeways 3 and 4 are blocked.\n- **Turns 16, 17, 18**: Freeway 8 is blocked.\n- All other turns (5, 7, 9-15, and beyond 18) are safe for all freeways.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9)\n- The player starts at (0, 3) at turn 5.\n- To reach y = 9, the player must move up 6 times (since 9 - 3 = 6).\n- The sequence of actions must avoid blocked freeways at each turn:\n  - At turn 5: Position is (0, 3) (freeway 3), which is safe (not blocked).\n  - Move up: At turn 6, position is (0, 4) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 6 (blocked only at turn 8).\n  - Move up: At turn 7, position is (0, 5) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at turn 7 (blocked only at turn 6).\n  - Move up: At turn 8, position is (0, 6) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is safe at turn 8 (blocked only at turn 6).\n  - Move up: At turn 9, position is (0, 7) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is safe at turn 9 (blocked only at turn 6).\n  - Move up: At turn 10, position is (0, 8) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is safe at turn 10 (blocked at turns 16-18, not turn 10).\n  - Move up: At turn 11, position is (0, 9), which is the goal (not on any freeway).\n\nThis path requires 6 actions (moves) over 6 turns (from turn 5 to turn 10), with \\(H = 6\\). The sequence is all \"U\" (up) actions, as no waiting or downward moves are needed to avoid collisions.\n\n### Output Sequence\nThe minimal sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- U: y increases by 1 (unless at 9, then stays)\n- D: y decreases by 1 (unless at 0, then stays)\n- S: stay (y unchanged)\n\nCollision condition:\n- At turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and the player's x-coordinate (which is always 0) is in the span of any car on that freeway at that same turn T, then collision.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is on freeway y. Only at the next turn (T+1) will the player be on y'. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway we are currently on (y) for collision.\n\nCar update:\n- For a car at freeway i (which is fixed, the car doesn't change freeway), at turn T (relative to t1=6), the car's position is updated as:\n  - If left-moving: span becomes [h - s*(T - t1), tau - s*(T - t1)]\n  - If right-moving: span becomes [tau + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nBut note: the description says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, note the initial state at t1 is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and since it's moving left, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the representation for left-moving: the head is the right end and tail the left? But the update for left-moving: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] so the entire car moves left. Similarly, for right-moving, the head is the leading end? Actually, the representation says for right-moving: span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h? and then at T: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] so the car moves right.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, y) and 0 is in the span of the car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 6. We need to plan from turn 6 to turn (6+H-1) such that at turn (6+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at y=4 at turn 6.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span at turn T includes 0.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). We want the minimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=4 and need to get to y=9, we must go up at least 5 times. We can also go down or stay, but that would increase H. So the minimal H without cars would be 5 (all U moves). But with cars, we might have to wait (use S) or even go down to avoid collisions.\n\nSo H will be at least 5.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn, starting from turn 6, and for each turn we decide an action (U, D, S) and then update the player's y and also compute the car positions at that turn to check for collision.\n\nWe need to check for collision at each turn T (for T>=6) when the player is on a freeway between 1 and 8.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T. If y_T is in {1,2,...,8}, then we must check all cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=6.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway at turn 6:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36) -> left-moving, so at turn 6: head=-24, tail=11? \nWait, the representation: for left-moving, the span is [h, tau] = [-24, 11]. But that doesn't make sense because -24 < 11, so the car would be from -24 to 11? That's a length of 35? Actually, the head is the rightmost? Then the car should be from left to right: tail to head? But the representation says [h, tau] and then moves left. \n\nBut note: the update rule for left-moving: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So at dt=0, the car is from h to tau? But if h=-24 and tau=11, then the car is from -24 to 11? That's a long car. However, the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". Typically, head is the front. For a left-moving car, the front (head) would be at the rightmost? So the car extends from the head (right) to the tail (left). But here, the head is -24 and tail is 11? That would mean the tail is to the right of the head? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem: \nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then it becomes [h-s*dt, tau-s*dt]. \nBut if h=-24 and tau=11, then the car spans from -24 to 11? That would be a car of length 35? Then when it moves left, both endpoints decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and becomes [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. \nSo for example, freeway 3: (24,13,right,12) -> at t1: [13,24] (because tau=13, h=24) -> then the car is from 13 to 24? Then moves right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning from tau to h? So if tau=13 and h=24, then the car is from 13 to 24? That makes sense.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" meaning from h to tau? But if h=-24 and tau=11, then the car is from -24 to 11? That is a very long car (length 35). \n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at t1: [ -11, 0 ]? Because for right-moving: [tau, h] = [-11, 0] -> so the car is from -11 to 0? Then moves right.\n\nBut then at turn 6, on freeway 5, there is a car from -11 to 0? Then at x=0, which is the head? So 0 is included? Then if the player is on freeway 5 at turn 6, they would collide? But we are at freeway 4 at turn 6? So not an issue.\n\nBut let me clarify: the player starts at (0,4) at turn 6. So we are on freeway 4? But freeway 4 has three cars? Let me list:\n\nFreeway 4 at turn 6: \n- (24,13,right,12) -> [13,24] -> so the car is from 13 to 24? Then 0 is not in [13,24].\n- (60,49,right,12) -> [49,60] -> not including 0.\n- (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35,-24] -> not including 0.\n\nSo at turn 6, on freeway 4, no car covers 0? So we are safe at turn 6.\n\nBut note: the player is at (0,4) and freeway 4 is safe at turn 6.\n\nNow, we need to plan the moves.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 6 (current) to when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must check for each turn T (starting at T=6) and for the freeway we are on at T (if between 1 and 8) whether there is a car on that freeway at T that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as fast as possible, but if we see a collision, we might have to wait or even go down.\n\nWe'll compute the car positions at each turn for each freeway.\n\nLet me define dt = T - 6.\n\nSo for a car, at turn T = 6 + dt, the span is:\n\n- If left-moving: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n- If right-moving: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nBut note: for left-moving, the initial span at dt=0 is [h, tau]. For right-moving, initial span at dt=0 is [tau, h].\n\nWe are only concerned with whether 0 is in the interval.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway that we might traverse: freeways 4,5,6,7,8 (and we start at 4, and we go up to 5,6,7,8,9). But note we might go down? But going down would be counterproductive. However, if we are forced to wait and there is a car coming that will pass, we might have to wait.\n\nBut note: we are at y=4 at turn 6. We must get to y=9. The minimal moves are 5 U moves. So we can try to do 5 U moves in a row, but we must check for collisions.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn.\n\nTurn 6: we are at y=4. We choose an action for turn 6 that will determine y_7. But note: at turn 6, we are already at y=4 and we are safe (as computed above). Now, we choose an action for turn 6.\n\nWe want to go up, so let's try U at turn 6.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 6, so we are on freeway 4 at turn 6 -> safe.\n\nAfter action at turn 6: we move to y_7 = 4 + 1 = 5? But wait, the update is: at turn t, we do action a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at turn 6: we do a_6, then y_7 = y_6 + delta.\n\nSo at turn 6, we are at y=4. Then we do an action, and then at turn 7 we are at y_7.\n\nBut the collision at turn 6 is already passed (we are safe). The next collision check is at turn 7, when we are at y_7.\n\nSo we need to know: at turn 7, what is y_7? That depends on a_6.\n\nWe are free to choose a_6. We want to go up, so let a_6 = U. Then y_7 = 5.\n\nNow, at turn 7: we are at y=5. We must check freeway 5 at turn 7.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars at turn 6 (dt=0):\n\n1. (0, -11, right, 12) -> right-moving, so initial span: [tau, h] = [-11, 0] -> at turn 6: car is from -11 to 0.\n2. (-48, -59, right, 12) -> [ -59, -48] -> not including 0.\n\nAt turn 7 (dt=1): \n- For the first car: [ -11 + 12*1, 0 + 12*1 ] = [1, 12] -> does 0 fall in [1,12]? No.\n- Second car: [ -59 + 12, -48 + 12] = [-47, -36] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 5 at turn 7 is safe.\n\nNow, we choose a_7. We try U: then y_8 = 6.\n\nAt turn 8: y=6, check freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 at turn 6: same as freeway 5? \n| 6 | (0, -11, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12) |\n\nAt turn 8 (dt=2 from turn 6):\n- First car: [ -11 + 12*2, 0 + 12*2] = [13, 24] -> 0 not in there.\n- Second car: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nWe choose a_8 = U -> y_9 = 7.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: same cars as 5 and 6? \n| 7 | (0, -11, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12) |\n\nAt turn 9 (dt=3):\n- First car: [ -11 + 12*3, 0 + 12*3] = [25, 36] -> no.\n- Second car: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23, -12] -> no.\n\nSafe.\n\na_9 = U -> y_10 = 8.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 6: \n| 8 | (-40, -51, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4) |\n\nBut note: the second car: (24,13,right,4) -> the representation: [tau, h] = [13,24]? But the problem says: (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front? So the car is from tail to head? Then [tail, head] = [13,24]? That matches.\n\nAt turn 10 (dt=4):\n\nFirst car: (-40, -51, right, 4) -> [tau, h] = [-51, -40]? Because the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving: span = [tail, head]? \n\nBut wait: the representation says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and the input is (head, tail, ...). So the head and tail are given, and then for right-moving we form [tau, head]? \n\nIn the input: the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nFor right-moving: the span is [tail, head]? \n\nSo for the first car on freeway 8: head=-40, tail=-51? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-51, -40]. \n\nSimilarly, the second car: head=24, tail=13? Then span = [13,24].\n\nAt turn 10 (dt=4):\n\nFirst car: [ -51 + 4*4, -40 + 4*4] = [-51+16, -40+16] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSecond car: [13 + 4*4, 24 + 4*4] = [13+16, 24+16] = [29,40] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, a_10 = U -> y_11 = 9.\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y=9. Since y=9 is the goal and there are no freeways above 8 (and the goal is safe), we are done.\n\nBut note: at turn 11, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check.\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn 6: U -> y_7=5\nTurn 7: U -> y_8=6\nTurn 8: U -> y_9=7\nTurn 9: U -> y_10=8\nTurn 10: U -> y_11=9\n\nTotal turns: from turn 6 to turn 10 (inclusive) we did 5 actions? Then at turn 11 we are at 9. How many turns? We started at turn 6 (position at turn 6) and after H turns we are at turn 6+H. We want to be at y=9 at turn 6+H-1? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\" such that after H actions, at turn t1+H, we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: at turn t1 (6) we start at y=4. Then:\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 6, y=4.\nAfter 1 action (t=0): turn 6+1 = 7, y_7 = y_6 + delta(a_6)\n...\nAfter k actions: turn 6+k, y_{6+k} = ?\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me read: \n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so H actions: a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThen the position after these H actions is at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the update: \nAt turn t1, we are at (0,y_{t1}). Then we apply a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1}).\n\nThen after the last action a_{t1+H-1}, we are at turn t1+H, and the position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at the turn after the last action? \n\nActually, the last action is applied at turn t1+H-1, and then we get y_{t1+H}? But the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWait, I think I misread.\n\nThe sequence is applied at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nAt the start of turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,4). Then we choose a_{t1} (for turn t1). After applying a_{t1}, we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1}).\n\nThen at the start of turn t1+1, we are at (0, y_{t1+1}).\n\nSimilarly, after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? Or at turn t1+H?\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But note: we are going to apply an action at turn t1+H-1? Then we move to y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut wait: at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we apply an action a_{t1+H-1} to get y_{t1+H}. But we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo the last action we apply is at turn t1+H-1, but we require that at the beginning of that turn we are already at 9? That doesn't make sense because we are applying an action at that turn.\n\nActually, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and the condition is \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note: the player position at turn t is (0, y_t). We start at turn t1 at (0,4). Then we take action at turn t1 to go to y_{t1+1}. We are at (0,9) at turn T for some T. We want T = t1+H-1.\n\nSo we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But that means we arrived there at the end of the previous action? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t is the state after the previous action? \n\nI think the timeline is:\n\n- At the beginning of turn t1: we are at (0,4).\n- We choose a_{t1} (for this turn) and then update to y_{t1+1} at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"current turn is t1\" and we are at (0,y_{t1}) = (0,4). Then we are to choose actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until we are at (0,9).\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn. \n\nAnd we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? Because after taking the action at turn t1+H-2, we become at y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen we do nothing at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1? That would be H actions, but the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would then be applied to the state at turn t1+H-1 (which is (0,9)), and then we move to y_{t1+H} which might be 10? But we cannot go above 9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the sequence of actions leads to being at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. That means we achieved that at the end of the previous action (at turn t1+H-2). Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are at 9? But then we might move away? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of H actions? \n\nWe must have H actions? But if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so t=0,...,H-1 -> H actions. \n\nBut then we have:\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and the state is y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? But that is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, which is after H-1 actions? \n\nSo we require that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9? Then why do we have H actions? The last action (the H-th) would be taken at turn t1+H-1 when we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says we are to reach (0,9) and stop. So we don't need to take an action after reaching? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". So we stop when we reach. Therefore, the last action that moves us to 9 should be the last one. \n\nBut according to the indexing, if we take H actions, then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back: the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo they require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But that means we achieved that at the end of the previous action (at turn t1+H-2). \n\nThen the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are at 9? And then we move to y_{t1+H} which is either 9 (if we do S or U/D that is blocked) or 8 or 10? \n\nBut we don't want to move away? \n\nAlternatively, we might do nothing at turn t1+H-1? But that would be an action S? \n\nBut the problem requires the sequence to have H actions. \n\nAnd we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we can do S at turn t1+H-1 to stay at 9? \n\nBut then we have taken an extra action? \n\nFor example, in our plan, we are at y=9 at turn 11 (which is t1+5 = 6+5=11). So at the beginning of turn 11, we are at 9. Then we would need to have H such that t1+H-1 = 11 -> 6+H-1=11 -> H=6.\n\nBut then we have 6 actions? But we only took 5 moves (all U) to get to 9 at turn 11. \n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U -> then at turn 7: y=5\nTurn 7: U -> turn 8: y=6\nTurn 8: U -> turn 9: y=7\nTurn 9: U -> turn 10: y=8\nTurn 10: U -> turn 11: y=9\n\nSo we have taken 5 actions (from turn 6 to turn 10) and at the beginning of turn 11, we are at 9.\n\nNow, to satisfy the condition: we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Here t1=6, so 6+H-1 = 11 -> H-1=5 -> H=6.\n\nThen the sequence must have 6 actions: from t1+0 to t1+5, i.e., turn 6 to turn 11? But we don't have turn 11 as an action? \n\nThe actions are for the turns: we have actions at turn 6,7,8,9,10 (5 actions). Then at turn 11, we don't take an action? \n\nBut the sequence must have H=6 actions? Then we need one more action? \n\nAlternatively, we can do an extra S at turn 11? But we are already at 9, so we can do S at turn 11? Then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 12? \n\nBut then we would be at 9 at turn 12, so t1+H-1=12 -> 6+H-1=12 -> H=7? That is worse.\n\nBut the problem says: we must reach at turn t1+H-1. So we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 6+H-1.\n\nIn our plan, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 11. So we set 6+H-1=11 -> H=6.\n\nBut we have only taken 5 actions? The problem says the sequence has H=6 actions? Then we must include an action for turn 11? \n\nBut at turn 11, we are already at 9. So we can do any action? But if we do U, we try to go to 10, but that is blocked, so we stay at 9? Then at turn 12 we are at 9. But then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 12, which is after 6 actions? \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 11? \n\nHow can we be at 9 at the beginning of turn 11? That means after 5 actions (turn 6 to 10) we are at 9 at turn 11. Then the sixth action would be at turn 11? But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn 11, so the action at turn 11 is taken from 9? \n\nBut the problem requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 6+6-1 = 11. So that matches. Then the sixth action is taken at turn 11? \n\nBut we don't need to do anything? But we have to output an action for turn 11? \n\nWe can do S at turn 11? Then we stay at 9. \n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut is that minimal? We have H=6, but we could have been at 9 at turn 11 without the extra S? \n\nBut the problem says we must output H actions? \n\nAlternatively, we can stop the sequence when we reach? But the problem says the sequence has exactly H actions.\n\nBut note: we are at 9 at turn 11 (beginning) and then we take an action at turn 11. That action is necessary for the count? \n\nBut H is defined as the minimal number of turns? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". \n\nWhat is a \"turn\" here? The player takes a turn? Or the game turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for H actions.\n\nIn our plan, we moved in 5 turns (actions) to get to 9 at turn 11. Then if we do an extra action, that would be 6 actions. \n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 earlier? \n\nWe started at turn 6 at y=4. The earliest we can be at 9 is turn 6+5=11? Because we need 5 moves. So we cannot be at 9 at turn 10? \n\nAt turn 10: we are at y=8 (if we did 4 U's from turn 6 to 9). Then at turn 10 we do U to get to 9 at turn 11. \n\nSo the earliest arrival is at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at turn 11. Then H must satisfy 6+H-1=11 -> H=6.\n\nSo we need 6 actions. The first 5 are U, and the last one (at turn 11) can be S (or even U or D, but S is safe).\n\nBut we must check that at turn 11, when we are at y=9, we don't need to check collision? Because freeways are only 1-8. So safe.\n\nBut what about during the moves? We already checked the moves from turn 6 to 10 and they were safe. And at turn 11, we are at 9, so no collision.\n\nBut wait: at turn 11, we are at y=9? Then we do an action (S) and then we are still at 9 at turn 12? But we don't care.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so:\n\na_{t1+0} = a_6 = U\na_{t1+1} = a_7 = U\na_{t1+2} = a_8 = U\na_{t1+3} = a_9 = U\na_{t1+4} = a_{10} = U\na_{t1+5} = a_{11} = S\n\nBut note: at turn 11, we are already at 9 at the beginning, so we can choose any action? S is fine.\n\nBut is there a problem with the car at turn 11? We are at freeway 9? Not a freeway, so no car check.\n\nBut we must check the turn when we are on freeways. So during the journey, we were on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 at turns 6,7,8,9,10 respectively? And we checked and they were safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn 6: we are at freeway 4 -> we checked and safe? Actually, at the beginning of turn 6 we are at y=4. Then we take action U. But the collision check at turn 6: we are at y=4 and freeway 4 at turn 6. We checked the cars on freeway 4 at turn 6 and they did not cover 0? So safe.\n\nThen we move to y=5 at turn 7. At turn 7: we are at y=5, and we check freeway 5 at turn 7: we did that and safe.\n\nSimilarly for the rest.\n\nBut what about freeway 8 at turn 10: we are at y=8 at turn 10? And we checked freeway 8 at turn 10: safe.\n\nBut note: we are going to be at freeway 8 at turn 10? And we did an action U at turn 10: then we move to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut at turn 10, we are at y=8, and we are safe? Then we do U, and then at turn 11 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the only extra action is at turn 11: we do S.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we don't need the extra action? \n\nThe problem requires that we output a sequence of H actions that leads to being at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWith our sequence: \n- After 0 actions: at turn 6, y=4 -> not 9.\n- After 1 action (turn 6): at turn 7, y=5 -> not 9.\n- ...\n- After 5 actions: at turn 11, y=9 -> then we are at 9 at turn 11, which is t1+5 = 6+5=11. \nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Here H=6, so t1+H-1 = 6+6-1=11 -> yes.\n\nBut after the 5th action (at turn 10) we get to y=9 at turn 11. Then we take a 6th action at turn 11 (which is S). But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn 11, so the 6th action does not change that we were at 9 at the beginning of turn 11? \n\nThe condition is about the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, which is turn 11. And at the beginning of turn 11, we are at 9. Then we take the action at turn 11 (which is the 6th action) and then we are at turn 12. But that doesn't affect the condition.\n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\nBut note: we could do the 6th action as U? But then we try to go to 10, but we can't, so we stay at 9? Same as S. Or D? Then we go to 8? But then we are not at 9 at the beginning of turn 12? But we don't care because we already were at 9 at the beginning of turn 11. \n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9) and we are at (0,9) at turn 11. Then we can do anything? But the problem doesn't say we have to stay. It only says \"reach\". \n\nHowever, to be safe, we do S.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWe start at turn 6 at y=4. To get to 9, we need at least 5 upward moves. The earliest we can be at 9 is turn 11. So no.\n\nBut what if we do some S (waiting) in between? That would make H larger, so not minimal.\n\nBut we might avoid collisions by waiting? In our current plan, we didn't have any collision. But let me double-check the freeways at the turns we are on them.\n\nTurn 6: freeway 4 -> cars: \n- (24,13,right,12) -> [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n- (60,49,right,12) -> [49,60] -> no\n- (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35,-24] -> no\nSafe.\n\nTurn 7: freeway 5 -> cars at turn 7 (dt=1):\n- First car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> becomes [ -11+12*1, 0+12*1] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]\n- Second car: (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> no\nSafe.\n\nTurn 8: freeway 6 -> same as freeway 5 at dt=2:\n- First car: [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> no\n- Second car: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> no\nSafe.\n\nTurn 9: freeway 7 -> same at dt=3:\n- First car: [-11+36, 0+36] = [25,36] -> no\n- Second car: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> no\nSafe.\n\nTurn 10: freeway 8 -> cars at dt=4 (since t1=6, T=10 -> dt=4)\nFirst car: (-40,-51,right,4) -> [tail, head] = [-51, -40] -> update: [-51+4*4, -40+4*4] = [-51+16, -40+16] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4) -> [13,24] -> [13+16, 24+16] = [29,40] -> no.\nSafe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with actions: U, U, U, U, U, S.\n\nBut the last action is at turn 11: we do S. But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn 11, so we could do anything? But doing U or D might be unnecessary, so S is best.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence must be for the turns starting at t1=6 to t1+5=11.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut wait: at turn 10, we do U, which moves us from 8 to 9 at turn 11. Then at turn 11, we are at 9 and do S.\n\nBut the condition is satisfied: at the beginning of turn 11 (which is t1+H-1=6+6-1=11) we are at 9.\n\nBut note: we were at 8 at the beginning of turn 10. Then we did U at turn 10, so we moved to 9 at the beginning of turn 11.\n\nSo the sequence is correct.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 at an earlier turn? For example, if we could be at 9 at turn 10? Then we would set H such that t1+H-1=10 -> 6+H-1=10 -> H=5.\n\nBut to get to 9 at turn 10, we would have to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 10. But we start at 4 at turn 6. We need 5 moves. The moves:\n\nAt turn 6: U -> y7=5\nTurn 7: U -> y8=6\nTurn 8: U -> y9=7\nTurn 9: U -> y10=8\n\nThen we are at 8 at the beginning of turn 10. To be at 9 at the beginning of turn 10, we would have to have done 4 moves and be at 9? But we are at 8. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6.\n\nBut note: what if we do an extra move earlier? For example, if we do a down move? That would only delay.\n\nSo the plan is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut the turn numbering: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn 11, which is t1+5 (since 6+5=11). And H=6, so t from 0 to 5.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for t=0: a_6, t=1: a_7, ..., t=5: a_{11}.\n\nSo we have to output:\n\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\nTurn 11: a_{11} = S\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" meaning we write \"Turn 6: U\", etc.\n\nSo that's the output.\n\nBut to be sure, let me check if we can avoid the extra S? \n\nSuppose we do only 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U for turns 6 to 10. Then we have:\n\nAfter 5 actions: we are at turn 11 at y=9. \n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn 11. \n\nNow, we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. If H=5, then t1+H-1 = 6+5-1 = 10. But at turn 10, we are at y=8 (if we did the first 4 U's: at turn 10, we are at y=8). \n\nHow so:\n\n- After turn 6: U -> turn7:5\n- After turn7: U -> turn8:6\n- After turn8: U -> turn9:7\n- After turn9: U -> turn10:8\n- After turn10: U -> turn11:9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn 10: we are at 8, not 9. At the beginning of turn 11: we are at 9. \n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need t1+H-1=11 -> H=6.\n\nSo we must have 6 actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut what if we do an action that is not U? For example, if we wait at some turn? Then we might be at 9 later? So H would be larger. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is the one we have.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn 6. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal number of turns required is H = 6, as it takes at least 5 upward moves to go from y = 4 to y = 9, and an additional turn (with a stay action) to satisfy the condition that the player is at (0, 9) at the beginning of turn 11 (t₁ + H - 1 = 6 + 6 - 1 = 11).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 6: Move up (U) to y = 5.\n- Turn 7: Move up (U) to y = 6.\n- Turn 8: Move up (U) to y = 7.\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to y = 8.\n- Turn 10: Move up (U) to y = 9.\n- Turn 11: Stay (S) to remain at y = 9.\n\nCollision checks are performed at each turn when the player is on a freeway (y = 1 to 8):\n- Turn 6 (y = 4): Cars on freeway 4 at turn 6 do not cover x = 0 (spans [13,24], [49,60], [-35,-24]). Safe.\n- Turn 7 (y = 5): Cars on freeway 5 at turn 7 do not cover x = 0 (spans [1,12], [-47,-36]). Safe.\n- Turn 8 (y = 6): Cars on freeway 6 at turn 8 do not cover x = 0 (spans [13,24], [-35,-24]). Safe.\n- Turn 9 (y = 7): Cars on freeway 7 at turn 9 do not cover x = 0 (spans [25,36], [-23,-12]). Safe.\n- Turn 10 (y = 8): Cars on freeway 8 at turn 10 do not cover x = 0 (spans [-35,-24], [29,40]). Safe.\n- Turn 11 (y = 9): No collision check, as y = 9 is not a freeway.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 6 turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 7. The player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move at turn T, you're on y_T for that turn, and you move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, so for turn T, you're still on y_T.\n\nThe key point is: if at turn T you are on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in its span at turn T, then collision. But if you change freeways, during turn T you are on the starting freeway.\n\nAlso, for the car positions: they move left or right based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease position, right-moving increase.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t₁=7. I need to compute where the cars are at future turns relative to t₁.\n\nLet τ = T - t₁ be the number of turns after t₁. So at turn T = t₁ + τ, for a car, its span changes based on speed and direction.\n\nFor left-moving cars: span at T is [h - s * τ, τ - s * τ], but tail and head: in the table, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), and since it's left, h should be greater than τ because it's moving left, so head is on the right, tail on left? Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], which I think means from h to τ, and since it's left-moving, h > τ probably, so the car is from τ to h, with τ left, h right? But the interval is given as [h, τ], which might imply h < τ if we think of positions, but that doesn't make sense for left-moving.\n\nLook at the example: for freeway 1, cars: (-60, -25, left, 36). So h = -60, τ = -25? But -60 < -25, so [h, τ] = [-60, -25], which is from -60 to -25, and since it's left-moving, moving to decreasing positions.\n\nAt T, [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ] = [-60 - 36τ, -25 - 36τ], where τ = T - t₁.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t₁), h + s*(T-t₁)]\n\nIn freeway 3, for example: (36, 25, right, 12), so [τ, h] = [25, 36]? But it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). Let's parse the table.\n\nThe table says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nSo for a car, head and tail positions.\n\nFor left-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, and since left-moving, head > tail, I assume? In freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36), here h=-60, τ=-25, and -60 < -25, so if positions increase to the right, head is at -60, tail at -25, but -60 is left of -25? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates: let's assume x=0 is the point we care about for collision. So positions are on the x-axis.\n\nFor a car, span is the segment it occupies.\n\nFor left-moving car on freeway 1: head at h=-60, tail at τ=-25. Since it's left-moving, and h=-60, τ=-25, -60 < -25, so tail is at -25, head at -60? That doesn't make sense because if it's moving left, the head should be leading, so for left-moving, head should have smaller x, I think.\n\nPerhaps I have the head and tail confused.\n\nLet's look at the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] and it becomes [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the example, h=-60, τ=-25, so [ -60, -25 ] at t₁.\n\nAs it moves left, both decrease, so at T, [ -60 - sτ, -25 - sτ] with τ=T-t₁.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn freeway 3: (36, 25, right, 12), so [τ, h] = [25, 36]? But it says head h=36, tail τ=25, so for right-moving, head at 36, tail at 25, so the car spans from 25 to 36, and since right-moving, it moves to increasing x, so at T, [25 + sτ, 36 + sτ].\n\nBut in the span notation, for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h] which is [25,36] meaning from 25 to 36.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h=-60, τ=-25, from -60 to -25, so from left to right? But if x increases to the right, from -60 to -25 is from left to right, but it's left-moving, which means it's moving towards decreasing x, so at next turn, positions decrease.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on k at that turn.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is at (0,y).\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to know when cars have 0 in their span at a given turn.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, I need to ensure that when on a freeway at turn T, no car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, the player starts at y=5 at turn t₁=7.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y from 5 to 9, and freeways 1 to 8, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars to collide with.\n\nThe player is at (0,y), and for y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible, only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, since we need to increase y from 5 to 9, that's 4 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 4.\n\nBut probably we can go directly up if possible, but need to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions at turn t₁=7.\n\nt₁=7.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-60, tail τ=-25, direction left, speed 36. Span at t₁: [-60, -25]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-60, -25, left, 36), so same, span [-60,-25]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\n1. (36, 25, right, 12) → head=36, tail=25, direction right, so span [25,36] at t₁\n\n2. (-48, -59, right, 12) → head=-48? tail=-59? For right-moving, it should be tail to head increasing. head=-48, tail=-59, since -48 > -59, so tail at -59, head at -48, so span from min to max, but in the notation, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Let's see the update.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, d, s)\n\nFor right-moving, [τ, h] is the span, with τ and h, but τ could be less or more? In this case, for car 2: (-48, -59, right, 12), so h=-48, τ=-59. Since right-moving, and h=-48, τ=-59, with -48 > -59, so tail at -59, head at -48, so the car spans from -59 to -48. And [τ, h] = [-59, -48] which is correct, from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly, car 3: (-12, -23, right, 12) → h=-12, τ=-23, -12 > -23, so span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAnd car 1: (36, 25, right, 12) → h=36, τ=25, 36>25, span [25,36]\n\nNow, for freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \" (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12) \" so identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (12, 1, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nCar1: (12,1,right,12) → h=12, τ=1, span [1,12]\n\nCar2: (-36,-47,right,12) → h=-36, τ=-47, span [-47,-36]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \" (12, 1, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12) \" yes.\n\nFreeway 7: same? \" (12, 1, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12) \" identical.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 4), and (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 4) → h=-36, τ=-47, right, so span [-47,-36]\n\nSecond car: (28, 17, right, 4) → h=28, τ=17, span [17,28]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when x=0 is covered by any car at a given turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, collision if on that freeway and 0 in car span at that turn.\n\nNow, let τ = T - t₁ = T - 7, so for turn T, τ = T-7.\n\nFor each car, the span at turn T is:\n\nFor left-moving: [h - sτ, τ - sτ] but for freeway 1 and 2, left-moving, span at T: [h - sτ, τ - sτ] with h and τ from above.\n\nIn general, for a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] where τ = T - t₁\n\nBut since for left-moving, in the initial, h and τ, with h < τ I think for freeway 1, h=-60, τ=-25, h < τ.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] no.\n\nFrom update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t₁), h + s (T-t₁)] = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] with τ = T-t₁.\n\nBut τ here is the tail position, not to confuse with time.\n\nI should use delta for time.\n\nSet δ = T - t₁, so at turn T = t₁ + δ.\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\n- If left-moving: span at T is [h - s δ, τ - s δ]  where (h, τ) are at t₁.\n\n- If right-moving: span at T is [τ + s δ, h + s δ]\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at turn T if the player is on k (i.e., y_T = k) and there exists a car on k such that 0 is in [min, max] of its span.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 in [a,b] means a <= 0 <= b.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for the player path, when moving to y, at turn T, if y between 1 and 8, it must be safe for that freeway at turn T.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at T=t₁=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we need to go up to 9, and 5 to 9 is 4 steps, but may need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the set of δ (time since t₁) when it is unsafe.\n\nδ = 0,1,2,... since turns are discrete.\n\nFor each freeway, compute for which δ, 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one left-moving car, s=36, h=-60, τ=-25 at δ=0.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s δ, τ - s δ] = [-60 - 36δ, -25 - 36δ]\n\n0 in this interval if -60 -36δ <= 0 <= -25 -36δ\n\nBut -25 -36δ is always negative since δ>=0, and 0 <= negative? 0 <= -25 -36δ is false because right side <= -25 <0.\n\nSimilarly, -60 -36δ <=0 is true for small δ, but since 0 <= -25-36δ is false, so 0 is never in the interval because the upper bound is negative and decreasing, so always negative, 0 cannot be <= negative number.\n\nSo for freeway 1, the car span is always negative, so 0 never covered. Similarly for freeway 2, same car, so also always safe? Freeway 2 has same car, so also no car covers 0.\n\nBut let's confirm: at δ=0, span [-60,-25], 0 not in. As δ increases, it shifts left, more negative, so 0 never in. So freeway 1 and 2 are always safe, no collision possible.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) so τ=25, h=36, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [25 + 12δ, 36 + 12δ]\n\n0 in [25+12δ, 36+12δ]? Since 25+12δ >=25 >0 for δ>=0, so lower bound >0, so 0 not in, always safe for this car.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48, τ=-59? tail τ=-59, head h=-48, so span [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-59 + 12δ, -48 + 12δ]\n\n0 in this if -59 +12δ <= 0 <= -48 +12δ\n\nSince -59 +12δ <=0 when 12δ <=59, δ <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so δ<=4 since integer.\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +12δ when -48 +12δ >=0, so 12δ >=48, δ>=4.\n\nSo for δ=4: -59 +48 = -11 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0? 0 <=0 true, so at δ=4, 0 in [-11,0]? span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\nSo 0 in [-11,0], yes, since -11 <=0 <=0.\n\nFor δ=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nδ=4: [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nδ=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at δ=4 for this car.\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (-12,-23,right,12) h=-12, τ=-23, span [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-23 +12δ, -12 +12δ]\n\n0 in this if -23+12δ <=0 <= -12+12δ\n\n-23+12δ <=0 when 12δ <=23, δ<=23/12≈1.916, δ<=1\n\n0 <= -12+12δ when -12+12δ >=0, 12δ>=12, δ>=1\n\nSo at δ=1: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0, so span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nδ=0: [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nδ=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at δ=1 for this car.\n\nNow, freeway 3 has three cars, but the first one never covers 0, so unsafe when either second or third car covers 0, so at δ=1 and δ=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 has identical cars, so also unsafe at δ=1 and δ=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) τ=1, h=12, span [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [1 +12δ, 12 +12δ] >0 always, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) τ=-47? h=-36, τ=-47, span [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-47 +12δ, -36 +12δ]\n\n0 in if -47+12δ <=0 <= -36+12δ\n\n-47+12δ <=0 when 12δ<=47, δ<=47/12≈3.916, δ<=3\n\n0 <= -36+12δ when -36+12δ>=0, 12δ>=36, δ>=3\n\nSo at δ=3: -47+36= -11 <=0, -36+36=0 <=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nδ=2: -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nδ=4: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at δ=3 for this car.\n\nFirst car not, so freeway 5 unsafe only at δ=3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 and 7 same, so unsafe at δ=3.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,4) τ=-47, h=-36, s=4, span [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-47 +4δ, -36 +4δ]\n\n0 in if -47+4δ <=0 <= -36+4δ\n\n-47+4δ <=0 when 4δ<=47, δ<=47/4=11.75, δ<=11\n\n0 <= -36+4δ when -36+4δ>=0, 4δ>=36, δ>=9\n\nSo for δ from 9 to 11 inclusive.\n\nCheck: δ=9: -47+36= -11 <=0, -36+36=0 <=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nδ=10: -47+40= -7 <=0, -36+40=4, span [-7,4], 0 in\n\nδ=11: -47+44= -3 <=0, -36+44=8, span [-3,8], 0 in\n\nδ=8: -47+32= -15 <=0? True, but 0 <= -36+32= -4? 0 <= -4 false, so not\n\nδ=12: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, span [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe for δ=9,10,11\n\nSecond car on freeway 8: (28,17,right,4) τ=17, h=28, s=4, span [17 +4δ, 28 +4δ] >17>0, always, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe only for first car at δ=9,10,11.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe at δ (time from t₁):\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at δ=1 and δ=4\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at δ=1 and δ=4\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at δ=3\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at δ=3\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at δ=3\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at δ=9,10,11\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at δ=0 (turn t₁=7).\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is unsafe at δ=3, but at δ=0, is it safe?\n\nAt δ=0, turn T=7, player on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: at δ=0, cars: [1+0,12+0]=[1,12] not cover 0, [-47,-36] not cover 0, so safe. Unsafe only at δ=3.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at their unsafe times.\n\nNow, player needs to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nMinimal steps: if no cars, could go U,U,U,U in 4 steps to y=9 at turn 11 (since start turn 7, after 4 actions: turn 7: at y=5, action U to y=6 at end of turn? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nThen during turn T, action a_T is taken, which determines Δy, and y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with constraints.\n\nAfter action, at end of turn, position is updated for next turn.\n\nBut for collision, during turn T, player is on y_T, and we check cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo for turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, must not collide with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} set.\n\nStart: turn t₁=7, y_7 = 5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9. When y_T =9 for some T, and since y=9 safe, we stop at that turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so H actions, and after H actions, we are at y_{t₁ + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t₁, position y_{t₁}, after action a_{t₁}, y_{t₁ +1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{t₁}\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t₁ + H} = y_{t₁} + sum of Δy over t=t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H} =9, starting from y_{t₁}=5, so sum of Δy = +4, since each U is +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nThe number of U minus number of D must be 4.\n\nAnd we need min H such that we can achieve this without collision during the path.\n\nH is the number of turns from t₁ to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nDuring the turns t = t₁ to t₁ + H -1, we take actions, and for each turn t, we are at y_t, which must be safe if between 1 and 8.\n\nAt turn t₁ + H, we are at y=9, which is safe, no action needed or checked? At turn t, when we are at y_t, we take action a_t, and during that turn, we are on y_t, so collision check for y_t at turn t.\n\nWhen we reach y=9 at turn T, for turn T, if y_T=9, it is safe, no collision, so we don't need to check for action or anything.\n\nThe last turn is when we first have y_T=9.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nPlayer at y=5 at turn 7 (δ=0).\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which at δ=0 is safe, as we saw.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFreeways 6,7,8 are above, but we can go directly up if no conflicts.\n\nBut freeway 5 is unsafe at δ=3, which is turn T=7+3=10.\n\nδ=3, T=10.\n\nAt turn T=10, if on y=5, unsafe.\n\nBut we might not be on y=5 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nSince we start at δ=0, and need to increase y.\n\nThe unsafe times for freeways:\n\nFreeway 3 and 4: unsafe at δ=1 and δ=4\n\nFreeway 5,6,7: unsafe at δ=3\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at δ=9,10,11\n\nFreeway 1,2 always safe.\n\nPlayer at y=5 at δ=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some point.\n\nThe minimal time: if we go up every turn, actions: at turn 7 (δ=0), action U, then y_8=6\n\nTurn 8 (δ=1), action U, y_9=7\n\nTurn 9 (δ=2), action U, y_10=8\n\nTurn 10 (δ=3), action U, y_11=9\n\nNow, at turn 11, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn if on freeway, it is safe.\n\nTurn 7 (δ=0): y=5, freeway 5, which is safe at δ=0, as we saw.\n\nTurn 8 (δ=1): y=6, freeway 6. Freeway 6 is unsafe at δ=3, but δ=1, is it safe? Freeway 6 at δ=1: cars similar to freeway 5, but freeway 6 has cars: (12,1,right,12) span [1+12δ,12+12δ], at δ=1 [13,24] not cover 0.\n\n(-36,-47,right,12) span [-47+12δ, -36+12δ], at δ=1 [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], not cover 0. So safe at δ=1.\n\nTurn 9 (δ=2): y=7, freeway 7, similar, at δ=2: first car [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] no, second car [-47+24, -36+24]=[-23,-12] no, so safe.\n\nTurn 10 (δ=3): y=8, freeway 8. Freeway 8 unsafe at δ=9,10,11? δ=3, T=10? δ=T-t₁, t₁=7, T=10, δ=3.\n\nFreeway 8 at δ=3: cars: first (-36,-47,right,4) span [-47+4*3, -36+4*3] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] not cover 0.\n\nSecond car (28,17,right,4) span [17+12,28+12]=[29,40] no. So safe at δ=3.\n\nThen turn 10 action U, y_11=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 10, we are on y=8, which is safe, then after U, to y=9.\n\nAnd at turn 11, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, we reached y=9 at turn 11, with H=4 actions? Turns: action at turn 7,8,9,10, so 4 actions, and after 4 actions, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t₁ to the end, but in the sequence, actions from t=t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=7,8,9,10, so H=4 actions, and y_{7+4}=y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, during turns: turn 7: y=5 safe, action U\n\nTurn 8: y=6 safe, action U\n\nTurn 9: y=7 safe, action U\n\nTurn 10: y=8 safe, action U\n\nAll safe, and freeway 8 at δ=3 is safe, as above.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 5 unsafe at δ=3, but at δ=3, turn 10, we are on y=8, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe times don't conflict.\n\nIn this path, we are on freeway 6 at δ=1, which is safe, freeway 7 at δ=2 safe, freeway 8 at δ=3 safe.\n\nAnd we reach in 4 turns.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more? Probably not, since 4 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at δ=1, freeway 3 and 4 unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, δ=3, freeway 5,6,7 unsafe, but at δ=3, turn 10, we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, and freeway 8 at δ=3 is safe, as computed.\n\nFreeway 5 at δ=3 unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, δ=4, freeway 3 and 4 unsafe, but we are at y=9 or something.\n\nIn this path, at turn 10 (δ=3), we are on y=8, then after U, at turn 11 y=9.\n\nδ=4 is turn 11, y=9 safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player starts at y=5, and we go directly to y=9 in 4 steps.\n\nBut in freeway 8, there is a car that makes it unsafe at δ=9,10,11, but δ=9 is turn 16, δ=10 turn 17, etc., which is later, not relevant since we reach by turn 11.\n\nt₁=7, δ=9: T=16, etc.\n\nSo in this case, no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4, with actions U,U,U,U.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t₁=7: action U, so y_8=6\n\nTurn 8: action U, y_9=7\n\nTurn 9: action U, y_10=8\n\nTurn 10: action U, y_11=9\n\nAnd all safe.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be actions for turns starting from t₁.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nH=4.\n\nBut is there a catch?\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, if we move to a new y, we are not on that freeway until next turn, but in this case, since we are moving up, at each turn, we are on the current y, and move to next.\n\nFor example, at turn 8 (δ=1), we are on y=6, which is freeway 6, and we take action U, so at that turn, we are on freeway 6, which at δ=1 is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, at δ=3 unsafe, but we avoid it.\n\nBut in this path, we never stay or go down, so no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions quickly.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, δ=3, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCars: first car (-36,-47,right,4) at δ=3: [-47 +4*3, -36 +4*3] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car (28,17,right,4) [17+12,28+12]=[29,40], not cover 0. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, earlier turns fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if going directly is possible, but seems so.\n\nBut in the freeway 3 and 4, at δ=1 unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nMaybe at some point we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps for y=5 at turn 10, but we are not there.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is vertical, and cars horizontal, so only when on same row at same time.\n\nIn this sequence, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me see if we can do in less than 4? From y=5 to y=9, difference 4, so minimum 4 actions, all U, no S or D, since S or D would require more U, so H at least 4. So 4 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we achieved it, so should be fine.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 8, there is a car with speed 4, but at early times, it is fine.\n\nPerhaps I miscomputed the unsafe times.\n\nFor freeway 5, unsafe at δ=3, which is turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, if on y=5, unsafe.\n\nBut in our path, at turn 10, we are on y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nMaybe at turn 7, δ=0, y=5 safe.\n\nTurn 8, δ=1, y=6 safe.\n\nTurn 9, δ=2, y=7 safe.\n\nTurn 10, δ=3, y=8 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in freeway 6 and 7, they are unsafe at δ=3, but at δ=3, turn 10, we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, not 6 or 7.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 unsafe at δ=3, but if we were on them at that time, collision, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, at δ=3, we are on freeway 8, which is safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is straightforward.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nSo for H=4, actions at turn 7,8,9,10: all U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 11, after 4 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from t=t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nIn this case, t₁=7, H=4, so actions at t=7,8,9,10.\n\nPosition after action at t is y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=10, action U, y_{11}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 10, y=8 is safe, which it is.\n\nBut in freeway 8, there is a car that will be unsafe later, but not at δ=3.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway at turn T, only on the starting one.\n\nBut in this case, it doesn't affect.\n\nFor example, at turn T, you are on y_T, take action, move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nSo when you move to a new freeway, you start on it next turn.\n\nIn this path, all is fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason to take a different path.\n\nSuppose we stay or go down to avoid something, but since we can go directly, and no conflict, it should be minimal.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at some time unsafe, but at the time we are there, it is safe.\n\nIn freeway 8, unsafe only at δ=9,10,11, which is turn 16,17,18, late.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4 with all U actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so yes.\n\nH=4.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be up to turn t_1 + H -1, which is 10.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway, relative to \\(\\delta = T - t_1\\) (where \\(T\\) is the turn number), are:\n- Freeways 1 and 2: Always safe.\n- Freeways 3 and 4: Unsafe at \\(\\delta = 1\\) and \\(\\delta = 4\\).\n- Freeways 5, 6, and 7: Unsafe at \\(\\delta = 3\\).\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at \\(\\delta = 9, 10, 11\\).\n\nThe minimal path to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 5\\) requires at least 4 upward moves (U actions), as the vertical distance is 4 units. The sequence of actions U, U, U, U over turns 7 to 10 achieves this in \\(H = 4\\) turns, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nCollision analysis for each turn:\n- Turn 7 (\\(\\delta = 0\\)): Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at \\(\\delta = 0\\) (cars: [1, 12] and [-47, -36], neither covers x=0). Action: U, moving to \\(y = 6\\).\n- Turn 8 (\\(\\delta = 1\\)): Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6).

Action: U, moving to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAt turn 11 (\\(\\delta = 4\\)), the player is at (0, 9), which is safe.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 6) on turn t_1 = 8. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, at that turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span. The span is the position of the car's head and tail at that turn.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=8, and I need to compute their positions for future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new row, you are not on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are still on y, and at turn T+1 you are on y+1. So you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T, which is the row you're on at the start of the turn. After you move, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T.\n\nThe note says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only care about cars on row y_T at that turn. When you move, you change row for the next turn.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are multiple cars with their positions at t_1=8.\n\nI need to find when a car on a certain row has 0 in its span at a given turn.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving cars, head is larger, tail smaller, and they move left, so position decreases. For right-moving, head is smaller? Let's see the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIt says for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is the head, τ is the tail, and since it's moving left, head should be the front, so if moving left, head is larger, tail smaller, so [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume? But in the example, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), 48 and 83, but 48 to 83, if left-moving, but 48 to 83, 83 is larger, so if moving left, head should be at larger x, but here it says head h=48, tail τ=83? That can't be right because if moving left, head should be at higher x, tail at lower.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in notation.\n\nLook at the car update rule:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t_1, head at h, tail at τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut for this to make sense, for a left-moving car, head should be at a higher x position, so if it's moving left, decreasing x, so h should be larger than τ? But in the example, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83? 48 to 83, but 83>48, so [48,83] is from 48 to 83, which is increasing, but if moving left, it should be decreasing.\n\nPerhaps the span is always given with min and max, but the direction indicates how it moves.\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving, it subtracts s per turn, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIt says: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, they define Span(t_1) as [τ, h], which might be from τ to h, and since moving right, τ is tail, h is head, so h > τ probably.\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), but it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), so for this car, h=48, τ=37, direction right, speed 12.\n\nBut for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48], so from 37 to 48, and moving right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, like freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], so from 48 to 83, but if moving left, it should be that head is at 83, tail at 48, but here it's listed as (head, tail) = (48,83), but 48<83, so if moving left, head should be at higher x, so perhaps head is 83, tail is 48, but the notation says \"head h, tail τ\", so for left-moving, h should be larger than τ.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48,83, left,36), 48 and 83, 83>48, so h=48, τ=83, but if h is head and τ is tail, and moving left, head should be at higher x, so here h=48 is less than τ=83, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the notation or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps the span is given as (position1, position2, direction, speed), and based on direction, we know which is head and tail.\n\nBut the text says \"head h, tail τ\" for each car.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\" Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) \"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), so for left-moving, Span = [h, τ] = [48,83], so it's from 48 to 83, which is a length of 35, but moving left, so at t_1, it occupies x from 48 to 83.\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [48 - 36*(T-8), 83 - 36*(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), but it says (h, τ, d, s) = (48,37, right,12), and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], so from 37 to 48, moving right.\n\nIn the list, for freeway 3, there are three cars: (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), and (0,-11,right,12).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, the collision is at position x=0, so we care when 0 is in the span for a car on the player's row at that turn.\n\nPlayer is at x=0 always, I assume, since it's (0, y).\n\nThe position is (0, y), so x=0, y from 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on the freeways, which are rows y=1 to 8, and they have x positions.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player on row y_T, and for that row, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when 0 is in its span.\n\nThe span changes with time.\n\nLet me denote t = T - t_1 = T - 8, so t is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nFor a car, at time t after t_1, the span depends on direction.\n\nFor left-moving car: Span at T = [h - s*t, τ - s*t] where t = T - t_1\n\nSince Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\n0 is in the span if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span) for that car at that turn.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in it if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor left-moving, min is h - s*t, max is τ - s*t? No.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s*t, τ - s*t]\n\nBut since the car is moving left, and if h and τ are such that at t_1, h < τ or what? In the example, for left-moving, like freeway 1, [h,τ] = [48,83], so at T, [48 -36t, 83-36t], so the min is 48-36t, max is 83-36t, so 0 in span if 48-36t <= 0 <= 83-36t.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s*t, h + s*t], so min is τ + s*t, max is h + s*t, 0 in span if τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t.\n\nIn the right-moving case, for freeway 3 car1: (h,τ) = (48,37) for right, so Span(t_1) = [τ,h] = [37,48], so at T, [37 +12t, 48+12t], min=37+12t, max=48+12t.\n\n0 in span if 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t, but since t>=0, 37+12t >0, so 0 <= min, so it can only be if min <=0, but min>0, so never for t>=0. Similarly, 48+12t>0, so 0 < min <= max, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars, we need to see when min <=0 and max >=0.\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 and max >=0.\n\nIf min <=0 and max >=0, then 0 is in the interval.\n\nIf min >0 or max <0, then not.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there are multiple cars, so for a given row and turn, if any car on that row has 0 in its span, then collision if player is on that row.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6, turn t_1=8.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is top, both no cars, so only when on y=1 to 8, collision possible.\n\nPlayer at (0,6), so on row 6 at turn 8.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nTo minimize turns, since I need to go up 3 rows (from 6 to 7,8,9), but I can also move down or stay, but moving down might not help, since I need to go up, so probably best to go up directly if possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nEach move U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nFrom y=6 to y=9, I need at least 3 turns if I move up each time, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nBut since the cars move, I need to find a sequence where at each turn, when on a row with cars, 0 is not in any car's span for that row at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway at t_1=8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36)\n\nFor left-moving, Span(T) = [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t] where t = T - 8\n\n0 in span if 48-36t <= 0 <= 83-36t\n\nSolve: 48-36t <=0 => 36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nAnd 0 <= 83-36t => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for t=2, since t integer, t=2: T=10, 48-72= -24 <=0, 83-72=11>=0, yes.\n\nt=1: T=9, 48-36=12>0, so min=12>0, not <=0.\n\nt=2: min=48-72=-24<=0, max=83-72=11>=0, yes.\n\nt=3: min=48-108=-60<=0, max=83-108=-25<0, not >=0.\n\nSo only at t=2, T=10, 0 in span for freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (48, 83, left, 36)\" so identical to freeway 1, so same, only at T=10, collision possible on row 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) but for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], so at T, [37 +12t, 48+12t]\n\nmin=37+12t >0 for t>=0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) h=-36? τ=-47? (head h, tail τ) = (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? Since τ=-47, h=-36, so min= -47, max= -36.\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 +12t, -36 +12t]\n\n0 in span if -47+12t <=0 and -36+12t >=0\n\n-47+12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈3.916\n\n-36+12t >=0 => 12t >=36 => t>=3\n\nSo t=3,4? t=3: min=-47+36= -11 <=0, max=-36+36=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nt=4: min=-47+48=1>0? min=1, max=12, both >0, not <=0.\n\nt=3: min=-47+36= -11 <=0, max= -36+36=0 >=0, so 0 in [ -11, 0 ], yes.\n\nt=2: min=-47+24= -23 <=0, max=-36+24= -12 <0, not >=0.\n\nSo only t=3, T=11, 0 in span.\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,12) h=0, τ=-11, right-moving.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? τ=-11, h=0, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 +12t, 0 +12t ] = [-11+12t, 12t]\n\n0 in span: min=-11+12t <=0, max=12t >=0\n\nmax=12t >=0 always for t>=0.\n\nmin=-11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so for t=0 only? t=0: min=-11 <=0, max=0, so 0 in span at t=0, T=8.\n\nt=0: T=t_1=8, min=-11+0=-11<=0, max=0+0=0>=0, yes.\n\nBut at turn T, for collision, at turn T, if player on that row.\n\nAt t=0, T=8, player is on row y=6, not row 3, so no collision at that time for player, but for the car, at T=8, on row 3, 0 is in span.\n\nBut player is not on row 3 at T=8.\n\nNow for t>0, min=-11+12t, at t=1, min=1>0, so not <=0, so only at t=0.\n\nSo for freeway 3, car 3 has 0 in span only at T=8.\n\nBut for player, we care about future turns.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"4 | (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\" identical to freeway 3.\n\nSo same cars, so on row 4, 0 in span for car3 at T=8, and for car2 at T=11? Let's summarize per row.\n\nFirst, for each row, when is 0 in some car's span.\n\nRow 1: only at T=10, from the car.\n\nRow 2: same, at T=10.\n\nRow 3: cars:\n\nCar1: (48,37,right,12) never 0 in span.\n\nCar2: (-36,-47,right,12) at T=11, t=3, 0 in span.\n\nCar3: (0,-11,right,12) at T=8, t=0, 0 in span.\n\nSo for row 3, at T=8 and T=11, 0 in span for some car.\n\nRow 4: identical to row 3, so at T=8 and T=11.\n\nNow row 5: \"5 | (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\"\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) h=24, τ=13? For right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [13,24], at T, [13+12t, 24+12t], min>0, never 0.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12) h=-24, τ=-35, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24], at T, [-35+12t, -24+12t]\n\n0 in span if -35+12t <=0 and -24+12t >=0\n\n-35+12t <=0 => 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈2.916\n\n-24+12t >=0 => 12t >=24 => t>=2\n\nSo t=2,3? t=2: min=-35+24= -11 <=0, max=-24+24=0 >=0, yes.\n\nt=3: min=-35+36=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo at t=2, T=10, 0 in span.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5? \"6 | (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\" identical, so at T=10, 0 in span.\n\nRow 7: \"7 | (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\" same as 5 and 6, so at T=10, 0 in span.\n\nRow 8: \"8 | (-32,-43,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\"\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4) h=-32, τ=-43? For right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-43, -32], at T, [-43 +4t, -32 +4t]\n\n0 in span if -43+4t <=0 and -32+4t >=0\n\n-43+4t <=0 => 4t <=43 => t <= 10.75\n\n-32+4t >=0 => 4t >=32 => t>=8\n\nSo t=8,9,10? t=8: min=-43+32= -11 <=0, max=-32+32=0 >=0, yes\n\nt=9: min=-43+36= -7 <=0, max=-32+36=4 >=0, yes\n\nt=10: min=-43+40= -3 <=0, max=-32+40=8 >=0, yes\n\nt=11: min=-43+44=1>0, not\n\nSo at T=16,17,18? t= T-8, so t=8: T=16, t=9: T=17, t=10: T=18.\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4) h=32, τ=21, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [21,32], at T, [21+4t, 32+4t], min>0, never 0.\n\nSo for row 8, 0 in span at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow summarize for each row, the turns where collision occurs if player is on that row:\n\nRow 1: T=10\n\nRow 2: T=10\n\nRow 3: T=8 and T=11\n\nRow 4: T=8 and T=11\n\nRow 5: T=10\n\nRow 6: T=10\n\nRow 7: T=10\n\nRow 8: T=16,17,18\n\nPlayer starts at turn T=8, y=6.\n\nAt T=8, on row 6, but row 6 has collision at T=10, not at T=8. At T=8, row 6: cars on row 6 at T=8, for row 6, cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=8, first car [13+0,24+0]=[13,24], min=13>0, not 0.\n\nSecond car [-35+0,-24+0]=[-35,-24], min=-35<0, max=-24<0, not >=0, so 0 not in span at T=8 for row 6. Similarly, collision only at T=10 for row 6.\n\nBut at T=8, for row 3 and 4, there is collision, but player not there.\n\nNow, player at y=6, T=8, no collision since no car on row 6 at T=8 has 0 in span.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nTo go from y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 moves up.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn where I am.\n\nSince I start at y=6, and I need to be at y=9, and rows 7 and 8 might have issues.\n\nFirst, row 7: collision at T=10.\n\nRow 8: collision at T=16,17,18, which is later.\n\nBut T=16 is far, so for early turns, only T=10 is critical for rows 1-7 except 3 and 4 which have other times.\n\nList of dangerous turns:\n\nFor row 1: danger at T=10\n\nRow 2: T=10\n\nRow 3: T=8 and T=11\n\nRow 4: T=8 and T=11\n\nRow 5: T=10\n\nRow 6: T=10\n\nRow 7: T=10\n\nRow 8: T=16,17,18\n\nPlayer at T=8, y=6.\n\nI need to move to y=7,8,9.\n\nSuppose I go up directly: actions U,U,U.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn T=8: start y=6, action a_{8}, after action, y_{9} = y_8 + Δy.\n\nLet's define the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, then chooses action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T and cars on row y_T at T.\n\nFor T=8: y_8 =6, row 6, at T=8, as above, no car has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nThen I choose a_8, say U, so y_9 = 6 +1 =7.\n\nNow turn T=9: y_9=7, row 7.\n\nAt T=9, row 7: cars? Row 7 has cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=9, t=1, first car: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], min>0\n\nSecond car: [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], min=-23<0, max=-12<0, not >=0, so 0 not in span. Safe.\n\nThen I choose a_9, U, y_{10} =7+1=8.\n\nTurn T=10: y_{10}=8, row 8.\n\nBut row 8 at T=10: t=2, cars: first car (-32,-43,right,4), Span(T) = [-43 +4*2, -32 +4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35, -24], min=-35<0, max=-24<0, not >=0.\n\nSecond car (32,21,right,4), [21+8,32+8]=[29,40], min>0.\n\nSo at T=10, row 8, no car has 0 in span? But row 8 danger at T=16,17,18, not at T=10.\n\nEarlier I have row 7 danger at T=10, but at T=10, I am on row 8.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=10, I am on row 8, which is safe at that time.\n\nThen I choose a_{10}, U, y_{11} =8+1=9.\n\nTurn T=11: y_{11}=9, which is goal, and no cars, so safe.\n\nBut the turn when I reach y=9 is T=11, after action at T=10.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=8: y=6, action U, to y=7\n\nT=9: y=7, action U, to y=8\n\nT=10: y=8, action U, to y=9\n\nT=11: y=9, which is goal.\n\nNow, at each turn, collision check:\n\nT=8: y=6, row 6, at T=8: as before, no collision.\n\nT=9: y=7, row 7, at T=9: row 7 cars: as above, min and max both negative or positive? Second car [-35+12t, -24+12t] at t=1: [-23,-12], both negative, 0 not in. First car [25,36] both positive. Safe.\n\nT=10: y=8, row 8, at T=10: as above, [-35,-24] and [29,40], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen at T=10 action U, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which is at turn T=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so turns t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=8, after H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1=8, position at beginning of turn.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=0 to H-1, actions at t_1 to t_1+H-1, then position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format: sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9?\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 is the turn when position is 9.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter actions, but y_T is position at turn T.\n\nWith actions from t=0 to H-1, corresponding to turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t_1, then y_{t_1} should be 9? But y_{t_1} is given, not changed by action at t_1.\n\nThe action at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo at the start of turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAfter choosing a_T, we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nWe need that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the task, it says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\", so at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nFor that to happen, the actions before must have brought us there.\n\nFor example, start at t_1=8, y_8=6.\n\nIf I do nothing, y_8=6, not 9.\n\nWith actions: after action at turn 8, y_9 set; at turn 9, y_9, action, y_10 set, etc.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T_final = t_1 + H -1, we need y_{T_final} =9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to T_final -1? Let's index.\n\nLet k = H, number of actions.\n\nActions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + k -1.\n\nAfter these k actions, the position at turn t_1 + k is y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + k -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + k -1} is the position at turn t_1 + k -1, which is before the last action or something.\n\nExample: suppose k=1, one action at t_1, then y_{t_1} is current, not changed, so y_{t_1} must be 9, but it is 6, not.\n\nSo need k at least 3? From y=6 to y=9, need to change y by 3, each action can change by at most 1, so min k=3 actions.\n\nWith k actions, y_{t_1 + k} = y_{t_1} + sum Δy from t=0 to k-1.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + k -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + k -1} is the position at turn t_1 + k -1.\n\nAt that turn, it must be 9.\n\nThe actions from t_1 to t_1 + k -2 affect y up to t_1 + k -1.\n\nSet T = t_1 + k -1, we need y_T =9.\n\nT is the turn when we are at 9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to T-1? Since actions at turn S affect y_{S+1}.\n\nTo have y_T =9, the actions at turns before T determine y_T.\n\nSpecifically, actions at turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., T-1.\n\nThe number of actions is from t_1 to T-1, so number of turns for actions is (T-1) - t_1 +1 = T - t_1.\n\nThen H = T - t_1.\n\nSince y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so t_1 + H -1 = T, so H = T - t_1 +1? Let's solve.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nThen the actions are from t=0 to H-1, so turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = T.\n\nActions at turns from t_1 to T.\n\nBut at turn T, we are at y_T, which is 9, and we choose an action, but since we are already at 9, we might choose S or something, but the position is already 9 at start of turn T.\n\nThe sequence includes action at turn T, but it doesn't change position for that turn, only for next.\n\nIn this case, for turn T, we need to be at y_T=9, and we can choose any action, but since we are done, we can choose S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify actions up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the direct up case, with 3 actions:\n\nStart T=8, y=6\n\nAction a8: U, then y9=7\n\nT=9, y=7, action a9: U, then y10=8\n\nT=10, y=8, action a10: U, then y11=9\n\nNow, at turn T=10, y10=8, not 9.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere t_1=8, so if H=3, then t_1 + H -1 =8+3-1=10, y10=8 ≠9.\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf we go to T=11, y11=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =11, so 8 + H -1 =11, thus H=4.\n\nActions at turns 8,9,10,11? But at turn 11, if y11=9, we don't need action, but the sequence includes actions from t=0 to H-1, for H turns? H is the number of actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor y11=9, t_1 + H -1 =11, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =11, thus H=4.\n\nThen actions at turns: t_1 + t for t=0 to 3, so turns 8,9,10,11.\n\nBut at turn 11, if y11=9, we can choose action S, for example, to stay.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions at 8,9,10: U,U,U, we have y11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, we are at y11=9, and we need to include action at turn 11 for H=4.\n\nSince we are at 9, we can choose S.\n\nSo sequence: turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U, turn 11: S.\n\nBut with S at 11, we stay at 9.\n\nBut H=4, but we reached at turn 11 with only 3 moves, but the position is at turn 11.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{8+4-1}=y11=9, yes.\n\nBut we used an extra S action, but since we need to be at 9 at that turn, and we are, S is fine.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nWith H=3, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{8+3-1}=y10.\n\nIf y10=9, then we reach at turn 10.\n\nBut from y8=6, to y10=9, that means in two actions, from turn 8 to turn 10, we need to increase y by 3, but each action changes by at most 1, so impossible to go from 6 to 9 in two steps: after one action, y9 <=7, after second action, y10<=8, so y10 <=8 <9, cannot reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, min H: since start at y=6, need to reach y=9, which requires at least 3 actions to change y by 3.\n\nAfter 3 actions, y_{t1+3} = y11.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn t1 + k is y_{t1 + k} = y_{t1} + sum Δy.\n\ny_{t1 + k} >=6 + (-k) but since we go up, assume positive.\n\ny_{t1 + k} <=6 + k.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is before the H-th action? At turn t1 + H -1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, then we choose a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we must have taken actions that brought us to 9 by turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSince start at t1, y=6, to reach 9 at some turn T, min T is t1 + 3 if we move up each time, so T=11.\n\nThen y11=9.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} =11, so 8 + H -1 =11, H=4.\n\nThen actions at turns 8,9,10,11: for turns 8,9,10 we need to move to increase y, and at turn 11, since y11=9, we can do S.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have actions that by turn 11, we are at 9.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, with U at 8,9,10, y11=9, and at turn 11, action S.\n\nBut at turn 11, y11=9, and we do S, stay.\n\nNow, collision: we need to check from turn 8 to turn 11, but at turn T, we check based on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn 8: y=6, action U → y9=7\n\n- Turn 9: y=7, action U → y10=8\n\n- Turn 10: y=8, action U → y11=9\n\n- Turn 11: y=9, action S → y12=9, but we don't care.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H-1}=y11=9.\n\nNow, collision check for each turn from 8 to 11:\n\nTurn 8: y=6, row 6, at T=8, as before, no car has 0 in span. Safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, row 7, at T=9: cars on row 7: min and max both not including 0, as before. Safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, row 8, at T=10: row 8 cars, at T=10, as computed, spans not including 0. Safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd at turn 11, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have action at turn 11, which is S, but since we are already at 9, it's fine.\n\nBut H=4, with actions U,U,U,S at turns 8,9,10,11.\n\nBut can we reach earlier? No, because y10 cannot be 9, as explained.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 10 with y=9, but impossible from y=6 in two actions.\n\nSo min H=4.\n\nBut in the actions, at turn 11, we do S, but we could do nothing, but we have to specify action.\n\nNow, is there a problem with the cars?\n\nIn this sequence, all seems safe.\n\nBut earlier for row 8, at T=10, it was safe, but let's confirm the car positions.\n\nRow 8 at T=10: t=2 (since T-8=2)\n\nCars: first car (-32,-43,right,4), Span(T) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-43 + 4*2, -32 + 4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35, -24], so min=-35, max=-24, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (32,21,right,4), [21 + 8, 32 + 8] = [29,40], min=29>0.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut row 3 and 4 have danger at T=11, but at T=11, if we are on row 9, no issue.\n\nIn this case, we are on row 8 at T=10, and row 9 at T=11.\n\nT=11 row 3 has danger, but we are not there.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? No, since H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can have H=3.\n\nH=3, then y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{8+3-1} = y_{10} =9.\n\nBut y10=9 only if from y8=6, with two actions: action at 8 and 9.\n\nAfter action at 8, y9 = 6 + Δy8 <=7\n\nAfter action at 9, y10 = y9 + Δy9 <=8 <9, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, if we do U and U, y9=7, y10=8, or if U at 8 and U at 9, y10=8 max.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nSo min H=4.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to specify actions for turns 8,9,10,11.\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y=9, so action must be S or D, but D would go to 8, not good, so S.\n\nU would go to 10, but y=10 invalid, since y<=9, so must stay or down, but down to 8, not 9.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so from y=9, U is invalid? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=9, cannot go U, because y_{t+1}=10 invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=0, cannot go D.\n\nSo from y=9, possible actions: S or D.\n\nBut if we do D, we go to 8, not 9.\n\nBut at turn t1+H-1=11, we need y11=9, so if we do D at 11, y12=8, which is not 9, but y11=9, it is at turn 11.\n\nAfter action at 11, y12 set, but we care about y at turn 11.\n\nSo at turn 11, y11=9, we can do S to stay or D to go down, but since we need to reach and stay? The task is to reach (0,9), meaning position at some turn is (0,9), and we stop, I think.\n\nBut in the sequence, we specify actions, and after that, position is 9.\n\nBut if at turn 11, y11=9, we do D, then y12=8, so position at turn 12 is not 9.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1+H-1} =9, which is y11=9, regardless of later actions.\n\nBut to minimize H, and since we are at 9 at turn 11, we can just do S.\n\nNo need to do D.\n\nIn the answer, we can do S at turn 11.\n\nNow, back to the car avoidance.\n\nIn the sequence above, it seems safe.\n\nBut let's confirm row 7 at T=9.\n\nRow 7: cars at T=9, t=1\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12), Span(T) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [13 +12*1, 24+12*1] = [25,36]\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12), Span(T) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-35 +12, -24+12] = [-23,-12]\n\n0 not in [25,36] nor in [-23,-12], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at T=8: safe as before.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nThe player is at (0,6), and we move up.\n\nBut rows 3 and 4 have dangers, but we are not on them.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach faster, but I cannot.\n\nAnother thing: at turn T=10, row 1,2,5,6,7 have danger, but in the sequence, at T=10, I am on row 8, which is safe.\n\nIf I were on row 7 at T=10, it would be dangerous, but I am not.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nH=4\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nIn answer: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo Turn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut at turn 11, action S is not necessary, but we need to specify for H actions.\n\nSince H=4, we need four actions.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, after three actions, at turn 11, we are at 9, but the turn index includes the action at 11.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we start later, but no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can move down to avoid something, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nBut let's see if row 8 is safe at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=11, row 8: t=3, cars: first car [-43 +4*3, -32+12] = [-43+12, -32+12] = [-31, -20], both negative.\n\nSecond car [21+12,32+12]=[33,44], positive. Safe.\n\nT=12: similar, no issue until T=16.\n\nBut in our case, we are not there at those times.\n\nSo the sequence seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nIn the car list, for row 8, there is a car at T=16,17,18, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on row 3 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, row 3: t=3, cars:\n\nCar2: (-36,-47,right,12), at T=11, t=3, Span= [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 +12*3, -36 +12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], so min=-11<=0, max=0>=0, so 0 in span, so if player on row 3 at T=11, collision.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are not on row 3.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 same.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4, with actions: U, U, U, S for turns 8,9,10,11.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 11, we do S, but since we are at 9, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can do only three actions, but then we need y_{t1+H-1} with H=3, y10=9, impossible.\n\nSo must be H=4.\n\nIn the actions, we can do U,U,U, and then for turn 11, since we need to include, we do S.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,6), and we go directly to (0,9) in three moves, arriving at turn 11.\n\nWith actions.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial position.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 8, when we are at y=6, and we move U, to y=7 at turn 9.\n\nBut is there a car on row 6 at turn 8? No collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving down helps to avoid, but since no danger on path, not necessary.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I move down to y=5 at some point.\n\nBut y=5 has danger at T=10, same as others.\n\nFor example, if I go down to 5 at turn 8, then y=5 at turn 9? Turn 8: y=6, action D, then y9=5.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=5, row 5, which at T=9: row 5 cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=9, t=1: first car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36]\n\nSecond car [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12]\n\n0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 9, action U, to y10=6.\n\nThen turn 10, y=6, row 6, at T=10: row 6 has collision! At T=10, row 6: cars at T=10, t=2.\n\nFirst car: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48]? t=2, [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], min>0.\n\nSecond car: [-35+24, -24+24]= [-11,0], min=-11<=0, max=0>=0, so 0 in span, collision!\n\nSo if on row 6 at T=10, collision.\n\nSimilarly, in my direct path, I was on row 8 at T=10, not 6.\n\nIf I go to row 6 at T=10, collision.\n\nBut in the down then up, I might be on row 6 at T=10.\n\nIn the sequence above: if at turn 8 D, y9=5; turn 9 U, y10=6; then at turn 10, y=6, and T=10, row 6, car has 0 in span, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I stay or something.\n\nBut in direct up, I avoid row 6 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, other rows at T=10 are dangerous.\n\nBut row 8 is safe at T=10.\n\nSo my sequence is good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4, with actions U at turn 8, U at turn 9, U at turn 10, S at turn 11.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nSo for t_1=8:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut H=4, and turns from 8 to 11.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) on turn \\(t_1 = 8\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the span of any car on that freeway contains position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\nThe car positions and movements are analyzed for each freeway to determine when \\(x = 0\\) is in any car's span (i.e., when collision occurs if the player is on that row). The results are summarized below, with \\(t = T - t_1 = T - 8\\):\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Collision at \\(T = 10\\) (only).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Collision at \\(T = 10\\) (only).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Collisions at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 11\\).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Collisions at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 11\\).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Collision at \\(T = 10\\) (only).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Collision at \\(T = 10\\) (only).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Collision at \\(T = 10\\) (only).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Collisions at \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\).\n\nAt the start of turn 8, the player is on row 6. The car analysis shows no collision on row 6 at \\(T = 8\\). To reach row 9, the player must increase their y-coordinate from 6 to 9, requiring at least three \"up\" actions (U). However, due to the game mechanics, the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\) must be (0, 9), and \\(H\\) must be minimized.\n\n- With \\(H = 3\\), \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{10} = 9\\) is required. But starting from \\(y_8 = 6\\), after two actions (at turns 8 and 9), \\(y_{10} \\leq 8\\) (since each action changes y by at most 1), so \\(y_{10} = 9\\) is impossible.\n- With \\(H = 4\\), \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{11} = 9\\) is achievable. The sequence must include actions at turns 8, 9, 10, and 11, with \\(y_{11} = 9\\).\n\n### Minimal Path\nThe sequence to reach (0, 9) in \\(H = 4\\) turns without collisions:\n- **Turn 8**: Start at (0, 6). Action U moves to (0, 7) at turn 9.\n  - Collision check at turn 8 (y=6): No collision (safe).\n- **Turn 9**: Position (0, 7). Action U moves to (0, 8) at turn 10.\n  - Collision check at turn 9 (y=7): No collision (cars on row 7 at T=9 do not have 0 in span).\n- **Turn 10**: Position (0, 8). Action U moves to (0, 9) at turn 11.\n  - Collision check at turn 10 (y=8): No collision (cars on row 8 at T=10 do not have 0 in span).\n- **Turn 11**: Position (0, 9). Action S (stay) to remain at (0, 9) for turn 12.\n  - Collision check at turn 11 (y=9): No cars, safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{11} = 9\\) with no collisions. \\(H = 4\\) is minimal because \\(H = 3\\) cannot reach y=9 by turn 10. Alternative paths (e.g., moving down) risk collisions or take more turns.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 4, with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For left-moving cars, the span [h, τ] moves left by s per turn, so at time T, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. For right-moving, [τ, h] moves right, so [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car with 0 in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on the destination row at the current turn.\n\nt1 is 9, and I need to find actions from t=9 onwards.\n\nCurrent position: y=7 at t=9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, and I start on y=7, which is a freeway with cars.\n\ny=7 has cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12). But since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h], so for the first car, τ=25, h=36? The notation says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger than tail, I think, because it moves right.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: span is [h, τ] with h > τ? No, in the update, for left-moving, span [h, τ] becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if it's moving left, h should be greater than τ, I think, so that decreasing both moves it left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, so increasing moves it right.\n\nIn the car list:\n\nFor freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), so head=60, tail=49? But for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h, so tail should be left, head right.\n\nHere head=60, tail=49, and direction right, so since head > tail, and moving right, the span should be from tail to head, so [49,60] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), head=12, tail=47? 12<47, but moving left, so if head is smaller, and moving left, span [h,τ] with h<τ might not make sense for decreasing.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet me read the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, and span is [h, τ], then to move left, h and τ should both decrease, so if h < τ, decreasing both would move the left end left, but the span might be from min to max? No, [h,τ] implies h to τ, but if h<τ, [h,τ] is from smaller to larger, decreasing both moves it left. If h>τ, [h,τ] would be decreasing sequence, but usually we think min to max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIf τ < h, [τ,h] increasing moves right. If τ > h, it would be decreasing, but that might not be intended.\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47. Since left-moving, span at t1 is [12,47]. But 12<47, so [12,47] is from 12 to 47. Moving left: at T, [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT], so for ΔT>0, both decrease, so the span moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), h=60, τ=49, direction right. But for right-moving, it says [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. Here τ=49, h=60, so [49,60] at t1, and moving to [49 + sΔT, 60 + sΔT], so since τ=49 < h=60, it moves right.\n\nBut in the notation, head and tail might not be in order; we need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFor collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nAlso, note that the grid position is x=0, and cars are on the freeway, so we check if 0 is in the car's span at that turn for the freeway we are on.\n\nNow, player starts at y=7 at t=9.\n\nI need to go to y=9. Since y=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so when I reach (0,9), I don't care about cars, as there are no cars on y=9.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, no freeway, I think, but player can be at y=0.\n\nIn the player update, y in [0,9], and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut we start from y=7, which has cars, and need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since from y=7 to y=9, if no cars, I could go up twice: U,U to y=9 in two moves, at t=10 and t=11? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=9, position y=7.\n\nAfter action at t=9, at the end of turn, y changes to new position for next turn.\n\nThe update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn T when the player is on y_T, which is a freeway, and for that freeway, if 0 is in some car's span at time T.\n\nNow, at turn T, when we are on y_T, we check the cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nThe span is given at T for the cars.\n\nIn this case, t1=9, so at any turn T, the car spans are determined based on t1.\n\nFor freeway k, cars are given at t1, so for turn T, we compute span as per the rule.\n\nNow, for y=7, at t=9, we are on it, so we need to check if at t=9, for freeway 7, is 0 in any car's span?\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst, direction right, so for each car, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] since right-moving.\n\nt1=9.\n\nFor first car: head h=36, tail τ=25? The notation is (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this car, h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=12.\n\nSo at time T, span = [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [25 + 12(T-9), 36 + 12(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-12? head=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-23 + 12(T-9), -12 + 12(T-9)]\n\nNow at t=9, T=9, for freeway 7:\n\nFirst car: [25 + 12(0), 36 +12(0)] = [25,36]\n\n0 not in [25,36], 0<25.\n\nSecond car: [-23 +0, -12 +0] = [-23,-12], 0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSo at t=9, on y=7, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions when on freeways.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, I am on y_T, and I take action U, then I move to y_{T+1} = y_T +1, but at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision check. Then at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nIf at turn T, I am on y_T, and I take action to go to y_{T+1} = y_T, then at turn T+1, I am still on the same row.\n\nBut collision is per turn on the row I am on.\n\nNow, to go from y=7 to y=9, I need to increase y by 2, so minimum 2 actions if I go U,U.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down if there are cars blocking.\n\nFirst, let's see if U,U is possible from t=9.\n\nStart at t=9, y=7.\n\nAction at t=9: if I take U, then y_{10} = 7 +1 =8.\n\nBut at turn t=9, I am on y=7, collision? We already saw at t=9, on y=7, no collision.\n\nThen at turn t=10, I am on y=8? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at t=9, y_{10} =8.\n\nThen at turn t=10, position is y=8.\n\nI need to check at turn t=10, for freeway y=8, is 0 in any car's span?\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (-28,-39,right,4) and (36,25,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head h=-28? Notation: (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4), so h=-28, τ=-39, d=right, s=4.\n\nSince right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-39 + 4(T-9), -28 + 4(T-9)]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4), h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=4.\n\nSpan: [25 + 4(T-9), 36 + 4(T-9)]\n\nNow at t=10, T=10.\n\nFirst car: [-39 +4(1), -28 +4(1)] = [-39+4, -28+4] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 not in [-35,-24]\n\nSecond car: [25 +4(1), 36 +4(1)] = [29,40], 0 not in [29,40]\n\nSo at t=10, on y=8, no collision.\n\nThen action at t=10: if I take U, y_{11} =8+1=9.\n\nThen at turn t=11, position y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I reached the goal.\n\nNow, at turn t=11, y=9, which is the goal, so H should be the number of actions? Let's see.\n\nI started at t=9, position at t=9 is given.\n\nI take actions at t=9, t=10, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nSequence: action at t=9, then t=10, ..., up to t=9 + H -1, and after that action, at time t=9 + H, position is y=9.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nI start at t=9, y_9 =7.\n\nI take actions a_9, a_{10}, ..., up to some a_{9 + K}, then y_{10} to y_{10+K}.\n\nI want y_{9 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=9 + H, position is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=9 to t=9 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=2, actions at t=9 and t=10, then y_{10} and y_{11}, with y_{11}=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, it's from t=9 to t=9+H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1+H-1}, and after that, at time t1+H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, with U at t=9 and U at t=10, y_{10}=8, y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt t=9, on y=7, no collision as before.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8, we checked for t=10, no collision.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo with H=2, it seems possible.\n\nBut is there a problem? I need to confirm for all freeways I might be on.\n\nIn this path, I only was on y=7 at t=9 and y=8 at t=10.\n\ny=7 at t=9: we have cars, but 0 not in span.\n\nFreeway 7 cars at t=9: as above, [25,36] and [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8: cars at t=10.\n\nFreeway 8: first car [-35,-24], second [29,40], 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut is there any car on other freeways? I wasn't on them, so no need.\n\nThe player is only at risk when on a freeway row at that turn.\n\nIn this case, I moved directly up.\n\nBut let me check if at t=10, when I am on y=8, is it safe? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I should verify the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: the car spans might cover 0 at some times, but since I am not on that row, it's fine.\n\nFor example, on y=7, at other times, but I was only there at t=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, only at t=10.\n\nIn this sequence, I was on y=7 only at t=9, and y=8 only at t=10.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 7, there is another car? Freeway 7 has two cars, both right-moving.\n\nBut at t=9, spans don't include 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nBut let me see for freeway 8, what about the cars.\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4), at t=9, span [-39 +0, -28 +0] = [-39,-28], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=10, [-39+4, -28+4] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4), at t=9: [25,36], at t=10: [29,40], etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 7 that might have 0 at some point? But I wasn't there, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, I need to reach y=9, so I might go through other rows, but in this case, direct up seems fine.\n\nBut let me check the other freeways to see if there are any issues, but since I don't go there, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=10, it's safe.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and 2 seems minimal since I need to go up twice.\n\nCould I go up in one action? No, because from y=7, if I go up, I go to y=8, not directly to 9. Each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo minimum 2 actions.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, there are multiple cars, but again, not on those rows.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot go directly.\n\nPerhaps at t=10, on y=8, one of the cars might be at 0, but no, as calculated.\n\nAnother thing: the car spans might be large or something, but in this case, no.\n\nLet me list all freeways and their cars to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 1: (12,47,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at T: [h - s(T-9), τ - s(T-9)] = [12 - 36(T-9), 47 - 36(T-9)]\n\nSince left-moving, and h=12, τ=47, so at T=9, [12,47]\n\nAt T=10, [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]\n\nNow, 0 is in [-24,11]? -24 <= 0 <=11, yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nBut this is for freeway 1, which is y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (12,47,left,36), identical to freeway 1.\n\nBut different freeway, so separate.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 both have cars that might have 0 in span at some times.\n\nBut I am not on y=1 or y=2, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: cars (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor each, span at T: [τ +12(T-9), h +12(T-9)]\n\nFirst car: τ=49, h=60, so [49 +12ΔT, 60+12ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [49,60]\n\nAt T=10, [61,72], etc.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, so τ=-35, h=-24, span at T: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [-35,-24]\n\nAt T=10, [-23,-12], etc.\n\n0 not in.\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1? τ=1, h=12, span: [1 +12ΔT, 12+12ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [1,12]\n\n0 not in [1,12]? 0 <1, not included? Assuming integers, [1,12] from 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nAt T=10, [13,24], etc.\n\nNow, 0 could be in if span includes 0, but here not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=25, h=36, span [25+12ΔT, 36+12ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [25,36]\n\nSecond car: head=-12, tail=-23, τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23+12ΔT, -12+12ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5? Freeway 6: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7: as before, (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nAt T=9, [25,36] and [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 8: (-28,-39,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=-28, tail=-39, τ=-39, h=-28, span [-39 +4ΔT, -28 +4ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [-39,-28]\n\nAt T=10, [-35,-24]\n\nAt T=11, [-31,-20], etc.\n\nSecond car: τ=25, h=36, span [25+4ΔT, 36+4ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [25,36]\n\nAt T=10, [29,40]\n\nAt T=11, [33,44], etc.\n\nNow, back to my plan: at t=9, on y=7, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8, check cars: first car [-35,-24], 0 not in; second [29,40], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen action U: to y=9 at t=11.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 that covers 0 at some time? For example, the first car: when is 0 in the span?\n\nSet -39 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -28 +4ΔT\n\nSo -39 +4ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -28 +4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 4ΔT <= 39, ΔT <= 9.75, so T <= 18.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -28 +4ΔT, so 4ΔT >=28, ΔT >=7, T>=16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 18, 0 in span? Let's see.\n\nAt T=16, ΔT=7, span [-39+28, -28+28] = [-11,0]\n\n0 <=0, so 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the endpoint, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17, [-39+32, -28+32] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=18, [-39+36, -28+36] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=19, [-39+40, -28+40] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut at t=10, T=10, ΔT=1, [-35,-24], not including 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car never includes 0 since min is 25 at T=9.\n\nBut I am on y=8 only at t=10, which is fine.\n\nIn my sequence, I am not on y=8 at other times.\n\nBut what about freeway 7? Similarly, cars might cover 0 at some times.\n\nFor example, freeway 7, first car: [25+12ΔT,36+12ΔT], min at T=9 is 25>0, never 0.\n\nSecond car: [-23+12ΔT, -12+12ΔT]\n\nSet -23+12ΔT <= 0 <= -12+12ΔT\n\nFirst: 12ΔT <=23, ΔT <=23/12≈1.916, T<=10.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+12ΔT, 12ΔT >=12, ΔT>=1, T>=10\n\nSo at T=10, ΔT=1, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt T=11, [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=10, on freeway 7, if I were there, collision.\n\nBut in my sequence, at t=10, I am on y=8, not y=7.\n\nAt t=9, on y=7, T=9, ΔT=0, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to the plan: actions U at t=9 and U at t=10, to reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nH=2.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm if y=8 is safe at t=10 with the cars.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=10: first car [-35,-24], second [29,40], 0 not in, yes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go slower or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: when I move from y=7 to y=8, at turn t=9, I am on y=7, after action, I go to y=8, but at turn t=9, I am still on y=7 for collision purpose. Then at turn t=10, I am on y=8.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, you are only at risk from the cars on your current row y_T.\n\nIn my case, fine.\n\nNow, but what about the goal? y=9, which I reach at t=11.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=1? If I go U, to y=8 at t=10, but y=8 ≠9, not goal. Or S, stay at y=7, not goal. D down to y=6, worse. So H=1 not possible. Minimum 2.\n\nSo with H=2, actions: a9=U, a10=U.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t1: a_{t1}, so Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 first car, at t=10, not at 0, but suppose I stayed or something, but I don't.\n\nPerhaps I should check if going up immediately is fine.\n\nAnother freeway: freeway 3 has a car (12,1,right,12), at T=9, [1,12], which includes x=0? [1,12], x=0 not included, since 1 to 12, 0<1.\n\nBut at some time it might, but not at t=9 or 10 for me.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=10, it is safe.\n\nBut let me see the second car on freeway 8: (36,25,right,4), at t=10, [29,40], fine.\n\nBut is there any car that is at 0 exactly at t=10 on some row? For example, on freeway 1 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 1: left-moving, h=12, τ=47, s=36, span at T: [12 -36ΔT, 47 -36ΔT]\n\nAt T=10, ΔT=1, [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], so if I were on y=1 at t=10, collision, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nBut I'm on y=8.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I only have two actions.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be minimal H, and sequence.\n\nBut is there a reason to have more turns? Probably not.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can go down or stay to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but I reach it directly.\n\nBut let me check if at t=11, when I reach y=9, but no cars, fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the cars on other rows, but not needed.\n\nBut in the car list for freeway 3, there is a car (12,1,right,12), at T=9, [1,12], which does not include 0, but at T=10, [13,24], etc., never includes 0 since min 1.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nFreeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSecond car: [-23+12ΔT, -12+12ΔT]\n\nAt T=9, [-23,-12]\n\nAt T=10, [-11,0], 0 in at T=10.\n\nBut again, I'm not on y=5 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7: same as above, at T=10, second car [-11,0], 0 in, so if on y=7 at t=10, collision.\n\nBut in my sequence, at t=10, I am on y=8, not y=7.\n\nAt t=9, on y=7, T=9, second car [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, with two actions: U at t=9 and U at t=10.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=9, so Turn t1: a9, Turn t1+1: a10, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=2, two actions: at t=9 and t=10.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} \\newline Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} \\newline ... }\n\nSo for H=2, only two lines.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car that might be at 0 later, but not at t=10.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait, but no.\n\nAnother thought: when I go from y=7 to y=8 at t=9 action, I arrive at y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=11.\n\nIs there a car on y=8 at t=10 that I need to avoid? No.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, the first car is at [-35,-24], which is far left, second at [29,40], far right, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in one turn, impossible.\n\nOr if I go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be in the specified format.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc., so I think it's fine.\n\nBut t1 is 9, so Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that at t=10, if I were to stay on y=8, but I don't, I move up.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nI think I'm confident.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis for Minimal Path:\n- From \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\), the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate by 2. The minimal number of actions required is 2, achieved by moving up twice (\\(U, U\\)).\n- Collision must be checked only when the player is on a freeway row (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) at a given turn, based on the car spans at that exact turn.\n\n#### Collision Check for Proposed Path:\n- **Turn 9 (\\(t = 9\\)):** Player is at \\(y = 7\\).\n  - Freeway 7 cars at \\(T = 9\\):\n    - Car 1: \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 12)\\), span at \\(T = 9\\): \\([25 + 12(0), 36 + 12(0)] = [25, 36]\\), \\(0 \\notin [25, 36]\\).\n    - Car 2: \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\), span at \\(T = 9\\): \\([-23 + 12(0), -12 + 12(0)] = [-23, -12]\\), \\(0 \\notin [-23, -12]\\).\n  - No collision. Action \\(U\\) is taken, moving to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 10.\n- **Turn 10 (\\(t = 10\\)):** Player is at \\(y = 8\\).\n  - Freeway 8 cars at \\(T = 10\\):\n    - Car 1: \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\), span at \\(T = 10\\): \\([-39 + 4(1), -28 + 4(1)] = [-35, -24]\\), \\(0 \\notin [-35, -24]\\).\n    - Car 2: \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 4)\\), span at \\(T = 10\\): \\([25 + 4(1), 36 + 4(1)] = [29, 40]\\), \\(0 \\notin [29, 40]\\).\n  - No collision. Action \\(U\\) is taken, moving to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 11.\n- **Turn 11 (\\(t = 11\\)):** Player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway (no cars), so no collision check is needed. The goal is reached.\n\nSince the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 after 2 actions (at turns 9 and 10), \\(H = 2\\). This is minimal, as fewer actions (e.g., \\(H = 1\\)) cannot achieve a \\(\\Delta y\\) of 2.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Action at turn 9: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\)).\n- Action at turn 10: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 10, and the player is at (0,8). We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nNote: The player moves at each turn by choosing U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1) or S (stay: y unchanged). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision condition: At turn T, if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, which is between 1 and 8) and if at that turn T, the car on freeway k has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player), then collision occurs.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on freeway y_T. Only at the next turn (T+1) will the player be on freeway y_{T+1}. So when we are at turn T and we move, we are only at risk from the freeway we are currently on (y_T) at that turn T.\n\nGoal: We start at y=8 at turn 10. We want to get to y=9. Note that y=9 is the goal and is not a freeway (since freeways are y=1..8). So once we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nHowever, to get to y=9 from y=8, we must use an 'U' action. But note that when we are at y=8 at some turn T, we are on freeway 8. Then we choose U at turn T: then at turn T+1 we are at y=9.\n\nBut at turn T (when we are at y=8) we must not collide with any car on freeway 8 at that turn T.\n\nAlso, during the journey, if we are on any freeway (y=1..8) at any turn, we must avoid the cars on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=10. We need to compute the positions of the cars at any future turn T (>=10) using:\n\nFor left-moving cars (direction 'left'): \n   Span(T) = [h - s*(T-10), tau - s*(T-10)]\n\nFor right-moving cars (direction 'right'):\n   Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]\n\nBut note: the representation of the car at t1=10 is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, the problem states:\n\nFor left-moving: at turn t1, the car span is [h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: at turn t1, the car span is [tau, h] and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the initial representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail, direction, speed) but the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". This is confusing.\n\nLooking at the example for freeway 3 and 4, we have right-moving cars: \n   (-48, -59, right, 12): so if at t1=10, the span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? \nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost? But in the representation, it's written as (head, tail). \n\nActually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So in the input, for a right-moving car, the first number is the head? and the second is the tail? and then the span is [tail, head] because it's right-moving? \n\nBut the problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the tail is the left end and head is the right end. Therefore, when moving right, the entire car moves to the right.\n\nSo for a car represented as (h, tau, d, s):\n   if d = 'left': the initial span at t1 is [h, tau] (with h >= tau, because the head is at the right and tail at the left) and then moves left.\n   if d = 'right': the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] (so tau is the left end and h the right end) and then moves right.\n\nBut in the input, for a right-moving car, the numbers might not be in order? For example, freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 12). Then the initial span at t1=10 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]. Then at time T, the span becomes [-59 + 12*(T-10), -48 + 12*(T-10)].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 3: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> initial span [-23, -12] and then moves right.\n\nAnd (24, 13, right, 12): wait, 24 and 13? Then initial span [13, 24]? But 13<24 so that's okay. But note: 13 is the tail (left end) and 24 is the head (right end). Then moves right.\n\nHowever, the problem says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So if we are given (head, tail) for the representation, then for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost. Therefore, the initial span is [tail, head]. \n\nBut in the input, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, the tail is the left end and head is the right end. Therefore, the initial span is [tail, head]. \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the representation (h, tau) and the initial span is [h, tau] meaning h is the head (right end) and tau the tail (left end). Then the car moves left, so the entire span moves left.\n\nNow, we are at turn 10, starting at y=8. We are on freeway 8 at turn 10. We must check if at turn 10, freeway 8 has a car that covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 8 at t1=10 has two cars:\n   car1: (-24, -35, right, 4) -> direction right, so initial span = [tail, head] = [-35, -24] (because tail=-35, head=-24). \n   car2: (40, 29, right, 4) -> wait, 40 and 29? Then initial span = [29,40] (because tail=29, head=40).\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [-35, -24] or in [29,40]? \n   [-35, -24] does not contain 0? because -35 <= 0 <= -24? -> no, because 0 is greater than -24? Actually, -24 < 0, so 0 is not in [-35,-24]. \n   [29,40] also doesn't contain 0.\n\nSo at turn 10, we are safe on freeway 8.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. The minimal way would be to go up immediately. But let's see: if we go up at turn 10 (i.e., a_{10}=U), then at turn 11 we are at y=9. But we must check that at turn 10, when we are at y=8, we are safe (which we are). Then at turn 11 we are at y=9 and that's the goal.\n\nBut note: when we are at turn 10, we are at y=8. We take action U at turn 10. Then at turn 11 we are at y=9. So we are done in 1 turn? Then H=1.\n\nBut wait: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. So if H=1, we only have one action: at t=0 (which is turn t1=10). Then the sequence is:\n   Turn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11 (which is t1+1) we are at (0,9). So that should be it.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision condition for the entire journey. We are only at turn 10 at freeway 8, and we already checked that at turn 10, freeway 8 is safe.\n\nIs there any requirement to check the freeway we leave? When we move, we are only at risk at the freeway we are currently on at that turn. At turn 10, we are at freeway 8 and we are safe. Then we move to y=9 at turn 11, and then we are not on any freeway.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 1 turn.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many cars? Maybe we need to check if at turn 10, freeway 8 is safe? We did. But let me recheck freeway 8 at turn 10:\n\nCar1: (-24, -35, right, 4) -> so tail=-35, head=-24 -> span = [-35, -24] -> 0 is not in this interval? Correct.\nCar2: (40, 29, right, 4) -> tail=29, head=40 -> span = [29,40] -> 0 is not in this interval.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 1, and the action is U.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ...\". And we are at turn 10 at y=8, and we want to reach (0,9) at turn 10+H-1? \n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (which corresponds to turns t1 to t1+H-1). Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nWe are at turn 10 (t1=10) at (0,8). We take action at turn 10: U. Then at turn 11 (which is t1+1) we are at (0,9). So we have taken H=1 action, and we are at (0,9) at turn 10+1-1? That would be turn 10? That doesn't match.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n   t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{10}\n   t=1: a_{11}\n   ...\n   t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd after these H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Let me read:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo we require that at the turn when we have taken the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the player position is updated after the action. So:\n\nAt turn t1 (10): we are at (0,8). Then we take action a_{10}. Then we update to y_{11} = y_{10} + Delta y_{10}. Then at turn 11, we are at y_{11}. \n\nSo if we take one action (H=1), then the last action is at turn 10 (t1+0) and then at turn 11 (which is t1+1) we are at y=9. But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 10+1-1 = 10? But at turn 10 we are still at y=8.\n\nThis is a confusion in the problem statement.\n\nLooking back: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we are at the state after having taken the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nWait, the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H (i.e., after the last action) is the state after the last action. \n\nBut the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThat doesn't make sense because at turn t1+H-1 we are taking the last action, and then the update happens to get to the next turn.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we are taking actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the player position after these actions? The position at turn t1+H (which is after the last action) is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is ambiguous. Let me see the example: if H=1, then we take one action at turn t1 (10). Then at turn t1+1 (11) we are at a new position. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 10+1-1=10? But at turn 10 we are still at the starting position (0,8) and then we take the action, so after the action we are at (0,9) at turn 11? \n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", meaning at the moment of taking the action? But at that moment we haven't moved yet.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, note: the player update rule: at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), and we choose action a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo if we want to be at y=9 at turn T, then we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that led us there.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have been at y=8 at turn t1+H-2 and taken U at that turn? \n\nBut we start at turn t1 at y=8. So if H=1, then we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+1-1 = t1=10. But at turn 10 we are at (0,8). \n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the problem must mean: we are to be at (0,9) at the turn immediately after the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nAlternatively, let me check the problem statement: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut that would imply that we are at (0,9) at the same turn we take the last action? But that's not how the update works.\n\nThis is critical. Let me re-read the problem: \n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nAnd the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have T = t1+H-1? But then we are at y=9 at the moment of taking the action? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turn\" in \"minimal number of turns H\" refers to the number of actions? And then we are to be at the state after H actions? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nI think there might be a misalignment. Let me look at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\", then \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\", etc.\n\nAnd we are to list the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we update to the next state at turn t1+H. So at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be the state before taking the last action.\n\nI think the problem has a typo. It should be: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H (i.e., after H actions).\n\nAlternatively, note the example: if we do nothing (H=0?) then at turn t1 we are at (0,8). But we want (0,9). So we need to move.\n\nBut let me assume that we must be at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1. That means at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nAnother interpretation: perhaps \"turns\" here refers to the number of game turns that pass. We start at turn t1. We are at (0,8) at turn t1. We want to be at (0,9) at some future turn. The minimal H is the number of turns that pass (so the number of actions taken) and the last turn we are at (0,9) is turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then if we take one action: \n   turn t1: we take action U -> then at turn t1+1 we are at (0,9). So we are at (0,9) at turn t1+1. Then H would be 2? because we went from turn t1 to turn t1+1 (two turns: t1 and t1+1) but we only took one action.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nLet me look at the update: the turn counter increases by one after an action. So if we take H actions, then we go from turn t1 to turn t1+H.\n\nWe start at turn t1 at (0,8). After H actions, we are at turn t1+H at some position. We want that position to be (0,9).\n\nTherefore, we want at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). And we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (total H actions). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is a clear discrepancy.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will look at the example provided in the car states. The freeway 8 at turn 10 is safe, and we are at y=8. The goal is y=9. The minimal action is to go up. But if we go up at turn 10, then at turn 11 we are at y=9. So we have taken one action (H=1) and we are at the goal at turn 11.\n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\", which would be turn 10+1-1=10. But we are not at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nSo either the problem meant to say \"at turn t1+H\", or there is a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, note that the player is at (0,8) at turn 10. If we want to be at (0,9) at turn 10, that's impossible because we start at (0,8) at turn 10. So the earliest we can be at (0,9) is turn 11.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem has a typo and it should be \"at turn t1+H\". \n\nBecause if we take one action (H=1), then we are at (0,9) at turn 11 = t1+1 = t1+H.\n\nSo I'll assume that.\n\nTherefore, for this problem: we are to find minimal H such that at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9), and we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the minimal H is 1, and the action at turn 10 is U.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 0 turns? That means H=0, then we are at turn 10 at (0,8) and we want (0,9) -> not satisfied.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nBut wait, what if freeway 8 at turn 10 is not safe? Then we couldn't go up at turn 10. But in this case it is safe.\n\nBut the problem has many cars on other freeways. Why are they there? Maybe if we had to traverse other freeways? But we are already at y=8, and we only need to go to y=9. We don't need to go through any other freeway.\n\nBut note: if we do not go up at turn 10, we might be forced to move down? But we are at y=8, and we can only move to y=7,8,9. But y=9 is the goal.\n\nSo the only move that gets us closer is U.\n\nBut what if freeway 8 at turn 10 is safe, but at turn 11 if we were to be on freeway 8 again? But we are moving to 9 at turn 11, so we won't be on freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut let me reexamine the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nAt turn 10, we are on freeway 8 -> we check freeway 8 at turn 10 -> safe.\nAt turn 11, we are at y=9 -> not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is just one action: U at turn 10.\n\nBut why are there cars on freeway 5,6,7? They are not relevant because we are only on freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nBut what if we had to go through other freeways? In this case, we don't.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there is a reason we cannot go up at turn 10. We already checked freeway 8 at turn 10: safe.\n\nBut what about the next turns? We are not staying, so we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". For H=1, t=0 only.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway 8 cars at turn 10:\n\nCar1: (head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right, speed=4) -> initial span at turn 10: [tail, head] = [-35, -24]. 0 is not in this interval.\n\nCar2: (head=40, tail=29, direction=right, speed=4) -> initial span: [29,40]. 0 not in there.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut wait, the representation for car2: (40,29,right,4). Is tail=29 and head=40? That makes sense: a car of length 12 (from 29 to 40) moving right.\n\nBut the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> [29,40]. Correct.\n\nSo I think we are good.\n\nBut the problem might be that at turn 10, we are at y=8, and then we move to y=9 at turn 11. But what if at turn 10, when we are at freeway 8, we are safe, but then at turn 11, if we were to be at freeway 8 again, we would have to check? But we are moving to y=9 at turn 11, so at turn 11 we are not on freeway 8.\n\nBut note: the action at turn 10 moves us to y=9 at turn 11. So at turn 11, we are at y=9 -> not a freeway.\n\nSo the entire journey is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what if we try to go down? That would be away from the goal. Or stay? Then we are still at y=8 at turn 11. Then at turn 11, we would be on freeway 8 again, so we must check freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nLet me compute freeway 8 at turn 11 (T=11, so T-t1=1):\n\nCar1: right-moving, speed=4. At T=10: [-35,-24]. At T=11: [-35+4, -24+4] = [-31, -20] -> doesn't contain 0.\n\nCar2: [29,40] -> at T=11: [29+4,40+4] = [33,44] -> doesn't contain 0.\n\nSo even if we stayed, we would be safe. But that doesn't help us reach y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we must eventually go up. And going up immediately is safe and takes one action.\n\nBut what if freeway 8 at turn 10 was not safe? Then we would have to wait or move down. But in this case it is safe.\n\nSo I think the answer is one action: U at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=1.\n\nBut let me see the format: we are to write:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\", etc. Since we have only one action, we only write one line.\n\nBut wait, the answer format says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then next turn, etc. So for one action, we only have one turn: turn 10.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 10, the player is on freeway y = 8. The cars on freeway 8 at turn 10 are:\n- Car 1: (-24, -35, right, 4) → Span at turn 10: [tail, head] = [-35, -24] (0 not in interval)\n- Car 2: (40, 29, right, 4) → Span at turn 10: [tail, head] = [29, 40] (0 not in interval)\n\nSince 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 10, the player can safely move up to y = 9 by taking action U at turn 10. After this action, at turn 11, the player reaches (0, 9), which is the goal and not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThis takes one action (H = 1), and the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\n}",
