Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Return the original buffer unmodified when trimming is disabled or base64 is requested.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Modify AudioBlock.resolve_audio to add trimming logic\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 173-186 (replace entire method body and signature)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve audio to a BytesIO buffer.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): If True, return audio as base64-encoded bytes in a buffer.\n            trim (bool): If True and `as_base64` is False, remove leading and trailing null bytes\n                (b\"\\x00\") from the resolved buffer before returning.\n\n        Returns:\n            BytesIO: The resolved audio buffer, optionally trimmed.\n        \"\"\"\n        buf = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n\n        # Only trim when working with raw binary (not base64) to avoid decode/encode overhead.\n        if trim and not as_base64:\n            data = buf.getvalue()\n            # Strip leading and trailing null bytes\n            trimmed = data.lstrip(b\"\\x00\").rstrip(b\"\\x00\")\n            return BytesIO(trimmed)\n\n        return buf\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve backward compatibility by defaulting `trim=False`.\n- Do not trim when `as_base64=True` to avoid altering base64 representation and incurring extra work.\n- New BytesIO created after trimming starts at position 0, suitable for immediate reads.\n- No import changes are required; BytesIO is already imported in this file.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Other agent owns additions:\n  - ImageBlock.resolve_image_with_size() inserted immediately after ImageBlock.resolve_image().\n  - AudioBlock.resolve_audio_with_size(as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = True) inserted immediately after my updated AudioBlock.resolve_audio(), and should pass `trim` through to ensure the size reflects trimmed audio by default.\n  - DocumentBlock.resolve_document_with_size() inserted immediately after DocumentBlock.resolve_document().\n- Other agent may add `from typing import Tuple` at the top as needed. I will not modify imports, avoiding conflicts.\n- File ownership:\n  - I own: modification of AudioBlock.resolve_audio method (lines 173-186 replacement).\n  - Shared file: llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py; insertion points are non-overlapping based on method anchors to prevent conflicts.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Currently, this requires manually seeking the buffer, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n\n**Solution**:\nImplement new method variants that encapsulate both resolution and size calculation. The original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged for backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n* llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Callers of resolve_* methods often need the size of the resolved BytesIO buffer and currently must measure it manually.\n- Goal: Add resolve_image_with_size(), resolve_audio_with_size(), and resolve_document_with_size() variants that return a tuple (BytesIO, int) to provide both the buffer and its byte length.\n- Requirements:\n  - Do not alter existing resolve_* methods for backward compatibility.\n  - Audio variant should default to reflecting trimmed audio size by passing trim=True to the (other agent\u2019s) updated resolve_audio().\n  - Compute size without consuming the buffer or altering its position (use len(buf.getbuffer())).\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File to modify: llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n- Add typing: Tuple to typing import list.\n- Implement three new instance methods:\n  - ImageBlock.resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> Tuple[BytesIO, int]\n  - AudioBlock.resolve_audio_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = True) -> Tuple[BytesIO, int]\n  - DocumentBlock.resolve_document_with_size(self) -> Tuple[BytesIO, int]\n- Size computation: len(buf.getbuffer()) avoids seek/read and leaves stream position intact.\n- Coordination: AudioBlock.resolve_audio signature is owned by the other agent and will include trim: bool = False (default).

The type: ignore is included only if the checker runs before the other change lands; it may be removed if not desired. If your environment has the updated signature, you can omit the `# type: ignore` comment.\n- Default trim=True so returned size reflects trimmed audio by default when not base64.\n\n### Step 4: Add DocumentBlock.resolve_document_with_size\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Immediately after DocumentBlock.resolve_document() (current end at line 224).
