Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Currently, Image.decode_example returns PIL.Image.Image only, requiring extra conversions.\n- Goal: Add an opt-in flag to Image to return a float32 NumPy array scaled to [0, 1] at decode time.\n- Requirements:\n  - Introduce a new public parameter as_array: bool = False on the Image dataclass.\n  - Persist the flag via features serialization (to_dict/from_dict) without breaking defaults.\n  - When as_array=True, convert the decoded PIL image to a NumPy float32 array in [0, 1] just before returning.\n  - Default behavior (as_array=False) remains unchanged (returns PIL.Image.Image).\n  - Avoid merge conflicts with the other agent\u2019s EXIF auto-orientation feature.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File ownership:\n  - Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n  - Other agent owns: [EXIF] logic inside Image.decode_example, inserted right after opening the image and before image.load(). They will import PIL.ImageOps locally inside decode_example.\n  - I own: the new dataclass field as_array, persistence (automatic via asdict/generate_from_dict), and the [AS_ARRAY] conversion block just before the final return of decode_example.\n- Serialization:\n  - datasets.utils.py_utils.asdict only includes fields when value != default. With default as_array=False, it\u2019ll be omitted unless True, which is the desired behavior.\n  - Features.from_dict/generate_from_dict will use dataclass defaults if the key is absent; therefore, no extra code is needed for persistence.\n- Type hints:\n  - Keep existing decode_example return annotation unchanged to minimize diffs and avoid conflicts with the EXIF edits. It will sometimes return np.ndarray when as_array=True (type hints are not enforced at runtime).\n- Normalization rule:\n  - If the image array dtype is integer: cast to float32 and divide by the dtype max (e.g., 255 for uint8, 65535 for uint16, etc.).\n  - If the image array dtype is floating: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1] without rescaling.\n- Order of operations in decode_example after both features:\n  1) Open/load image (existing logic)\n  2) [EXIF] auto-orientation (other agent)\n  3) image.load() (existing)\n  4) Optional mode conversion (existing)\n  5) [AS_ARRAY] optional NumPy float32 normalization (this plan)\n  6) Return\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add the `as_array` flag to the Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around class fields definition (after `decode: bool = True`)\nAction: Insert a new dataclass field and update the docstring Args section\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     as_array: bool = False\n87     id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nDocstring update (at the top of class Image, Args section): add a new bullet after `decode` explaining the new flag.\nBefore Docstring (excerpt around Args):\n```\n62     Args:\n63         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n64             The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n65         decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n66             Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n67             returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Docstring addition:\n```\n62     Args:\n63         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n64             The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n65         decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n66             Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n67             returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n68         as_array (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n69             If `True`, return the decoded image as a NumPy array of dtype `float32` scaled to [0, 1].\n70             If `False`, return a `PIL.Image.Image`.\n```\n\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the default `False` so existing behavior and tests remain unchanged.\n- No changes to dtype or pa_type.\n\n### Step 2: Add a private helper `_maybe_to_array` for conditional conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Inside class Image, directly after `decode_example` and before `flatten`\nAction: Add a new method\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n191         return image\n\n193     def flatten(self) -> Union[\"FeatureType\", Dict[str, \"FeatureType\"]]:\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n191         return image\n\n    # [AS_ARRAY] helper to optionally normalize decoded image to float32 NumPy array in [0, 1]\n    def _maybe_to_array(self, image):\n        if not self.as_array:\n            return image\n        # Convert to NumPy and normalize\n        arr = np.asarray(image)\n        if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer):\n            denom = np.float32(np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max)\n            arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / denom\n        else:\n            arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n            # Clip to [0, 1] in case of float images\n            arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n        return arr\n\n193     def flatten(self) -> Union[\"FeatureType\", Dict[str, \"FeatureType\"]]:\n```\n\nCritical Details:\n- Use existing top-level `import numpy as np` (already present at line 8 per HEAD) \u2014 no new imports needed.\n- Keep method simple and side-effect free.\n\n### Step 3: Invoke `_maybe_to_array` at the end of decoding\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: In `Image.decode_example`, replace the final return statement\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n190             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n191         return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n190             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n191         # [AS_ARRAY] optional NumPy float32 normalization\n192         return self._maybe_to_array(image)\n```\n\nCritical Details:\n- This call site sits after any EXIF orientation correction the other agent inserts, since they will place their block right after image opening and before image.load().\n- A single return point is kept as agreed.\n\n### Step 4: No changes to imports\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: None\nCritical Details:\n- `numpy as np` already exists at the top of the file; no extra imports needed.\n- This avoids top-of-file merge diffs with the other agent.\n\n### Step 5: Ensure serialization behavior remains correct (no code change needed)\n- to_dict uses `asdict(self)` which omits default-valued fields. `as_array=False` (default) won\u2019t appear; `True` will be included, enabling persistence through Features.\n- from_dict via `generate_from_dict` will apply the default if the key is missing.\n\n### Step 6: Maintain public API compatibility\n- No change to class name, dtype, pa_type, or the default return type when `as_array=False`.\n- Return type annotation of `decode_example` is left unchanged to minimize diffs and avoid conflicts.\n\n### Step 7: Coordinate with EXIF feature (other agent)\n- Other agent will add `[EXIF] auto-orientation` inline block inside `decode_example` immediately after `PIL.Image.open(...)` and before `image.load()`.\n- My `[AS_ARRAY]` block remains at the very end of `decode_example`, just before the return.\n- No overlapping edits to imports or to earlier parts of `decode_example`.\n\n### Step 8: Sanity check and examples (no code changes required)\n- Existing tests are unaffected since the default remains to return PIL.Image.Image.\n- When users opt-in: `ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(as_array=True))` then `ds[0]['image']` yields `np.ndarray` with `dtype=float32` and values in [0, 1].\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n- Other agent owns:\n  - Inline `[EXIF] auto-orientation` block in `decode_example`, placed pre-`image.load()`.\n  - They will not change the final return type or refactor returns.\n- I own:\n  - New `as_array` dataclass field (line ~86 in current HEAD) and its docstring entry.\n  - New `_maybe_to_array` method added just before `flatten()`.\n  - Modify the final return in `decode_example` to `return self._maybe_to_array(image)` and add the `[AS_ARRAY]` comment.\n- Dependency order: Either can implement first; no conflicts. If both land, the decode order is Open -> [EXIF] -> load -> optional convert -> [AS_ARRAY] -> return.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature1\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:20:37.058185\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Images with EXIF orientation tags appear rotated/flipped when decoded via PIL in datasets Image feature, leading to inconsistent orientation and dimensions for downstream tasks.\n- Goal: Automatically correct EXIF orientation during image decoding so returned images have the proper orientation without requiring user preprocessing.\n- Requirements:\n  - Modify only internal decoding in Image.decode_example to apply EXIF orientation correction.\n  - Do not change public API or return types when decode=True and as_array (other agent\u2019s flag) is False.\n  - Keep a single return site to allow the other agent to add their optional array conversion block at the end.\n  - Avoid broad file changes; add a small, clearly labeled block.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File to modify: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- Function: Image.decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n- Import strategy: Import PIL.ImageOps locally inside decode_example (after ensuring PIL availability) to reduce top-level import churn.\n- Placement order in decode_example:\n  1) Open image from path or bytes (existing code)\n  2) [EXIF] auto-orientation: apply ImageOps.exif_transpose(image) in a try/except block\n  3) image.load() (existing), mode conversion if requested (existing)\n  4) Final return (existing)\n- Safety:\n  - ImageOps.exif_transpose is idempotent on images without EXIF orientation, and won\u2019t raise if EXIF is missing.\n  - Wrap in try/except to be robust to Pillow versions lacking exif_transpose or unusual errors; on failure, fall back to original image without interrupting flow.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add EXIF auto-orientation block inside decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around current line 188, immediately after the image is opened from path/bytes and before `image.load()`.\nAction: Insert labeled block.\nBefore Code:\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n\n        # [EXIF] auto-orientation: apply EXIF-based transpose if available\n        try:\n            from PIL import ImageOps  # local import to minimize global changes\n            # ImageOps.exif_transpose will no-op if there is no EXIF orientation tag\n            image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n        except Exception:\n            # Be conservative: on any failure (e.g., Pillow version or corrupt EXIF), proceed without altering the image\n            pass\n\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the single return at the end of decode_example.\n- Do not modify signatures, dataclass fields, or other parts of the file.\n- The try/except is intentionally broad to avoid surfacing Pillow-specific errors to users.\n\n### Step 2: Add inline comment markers for coordination\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Same insertion block inside decode_example.\nAction: Ensure the comment marker `# [EXIF] auto-orientation` is present for clarity and future coordination.\nBefore Code: N/A (covered in Step 1)\nAfter Code: As shown above, includes the marker comment.\nCritical Details:\n- This marker helps the other agent identify the block and place their `[AS_ARRAY]` block just before the final return.\n\n### Step 3: Verify no top-level imports added\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Top of file\nAction: No change required.\nCritical Details:\n- numpy is already imported; we do not add PIL.ImageOps at top-level to reduce chance of conflicts.\n\n### Step 4: Maintain single return site\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: decode_example return\nAction: No change to the return statement, to ensure the other agent can insert their `[AS_ARRAY]` block just before `return image`.\nCritical Details:\n- The function continues to return a PIL.Image.Image when as_array is False (per coordination plan).\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership:\n  - Mine: `src/datasets/features/image.py` \u2014 only the `[EXIF] auto-orientation` block inside `decode_example` after image open and before `image.load()`.\n  - Theirs: `src/datasets/features/image.py` \u2014 add `as_array: bool = False` dataclass field and persistence in to_dict/from_dict/eq/repr if needed, and the `[AS_ARRAY]` conversion block just before the final return.\n- Insertion order in decode_example (agreed):\n  1) Open image\n  2) [EXIF] auto-orientation (mine)\n  3) image.load() and mode conversion (existing)\n  4) [AS_ARRAY] optional NumPy float32 normalization (theirs, just before return)\n  5) return image\n- No other files will be modified by me.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature5\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:20:37.058805\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Downstream users often need images as NumPy arrays with normalized float32 values in [0, 1]. Currently, Image.decode_example returns PIL.Image.Image only, requiring extra conversions.\n- Goal: Add an opt-in flag to Image to return a float32 NumPy array scaled to [0, 1] at decode time.\n- Requirements:\n  - Introduce a new public parameter as_array: bool = False on the Image dataclass.\n  - Persist the flag via features serialization (to_dict/from_dict) without breaking defaults.\n  - When as_array=True, convert the decoded PIL image to a NumPy float32 array in [0, 1] just before returning.\n  - Default behavior (as_array=False) remains unchanged (returns PIL.Image.Image).\n  - Avoid merge conflicts with the other agent\u2019s EXIF auto-orientation feature.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File ownership:\n  - Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n  - Other agent owns: [EXIF] logic inside Image.decode_example, inserted right after opening the image and before image.load(). They will import PIL.ImageOps locally inside decode_example.\n  - I own: the new dataclass field as_array, persistence (automatic via asdict/generate_from_dict), and the [AS_ARRAY] conversion block just before the final return of decode_example.\n- Serialization:\n  - datasets.utils.py_utils.asdict only includes fields when value != default. With default as_array=False, it\u2019ll be omitted unless True, which is the desired behavior.\n  - Features.from_dict/generate_from_dict will use dataclass defaults if the key is absent; therefore, no extra code is needed for persistence.\n- Type hints:\n  - Keep existing decode_example return annotation unchanged to minimize diffs and avoid conflicts with the EXIF edits. It will sometimes return np.ndarray when as_array=True (type hints are not enforced at runtime).\n- Normalization rule:\n  - If the image array dtype is integer: cast to float32 and divide by the dtype max (e.g., 255 for uint8, 65535 for uint16, etc.).\n  - If the image array dtype is floating: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1] without rescaling.\n- Order of operations in decode_example after both features:\n  1) Open/load image (existing logic)\n  2) [EXIF] auto-orientation (other agent)\n  3) image.load() (existing)\n  4) Optional mode conversion (existing)\n  5) [AS_ARRAY] optional NumPy float32 normalization (this plan)\n  6) Return\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add the `as_array` flag to the Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around class fields definition (after `decode: bool = True`)\nAction: Insert a new dataclass field and update the docstring Args section\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     as_array: bool = False\n87     id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nDocstring update (at the top of class Image, Args section): add a new bullet after `decode` explaining the new flag.\nBefore Docstring (excerpt around Args):\n```\n62     Args:\n63         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n64             The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n65         decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n66             Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n67             returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Docstring addition:\n```\n62     Args:\n63         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n64             The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n65         decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n66             Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n67             returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n68         as_array (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n69             If `True`, return the decoded image as a NumPy array of dtype `float32` scaled to [0, 1].\n70             If `False`, return a `PIL.Image.Image`.\n```\n\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the default `False` so existing behavior and tests remain unchanged.\n- No changes to dtype or pa_type.\n\n### Step 2: Add a private helper `_maybe_to_array` for conditional conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Inside class Image, directly after `decode_example` and before `flatten`\nAction: Add a new method\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n191         return image\n\n193     def flatten(self) -> Union[\"FeatureType\", Dict[str, \"FeatureType\"]]:\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n191         return image\n\n    # [AS_ARRAY] helper to optionally normalize decoded image to float32 NumPy array in [0, 1]\n    def _maybe_to_array(self, image):\n        if not self.as_array:\n            return image\n        # Convert to NumPy and normalize\n        arr = np.asarray(image)\n        if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer):\n            denom = np.float32(np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max)\n            arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / denom\n        else:\n            arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n            # Clip to [0, 1] in case of float images\n            arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n        return arr\n\n193     def flatten(self) -> Union[\"FeatureType\", Dict[str, \"FeatureType\"]]:\n```\n\nCritical Details:\n- Use existing top-level `import numpy as np` (already present at line 8 per HEAD) \u2014 no new imports needed.\n- Keep method simple and side-effect free.\n\n### Step 3: Invoke `_maybe_to_array` at the end of decoding\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: In `Image.decode_example`, replace the final return statement\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n190             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n191         return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n190             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n191         # [AS_ARRAY] optional NumPy float32 normalization\n192         return self._maybe_to_array(image)\n```\n\nCritical Details:\n- This call site sits after any EXIF orientation correction the other agent inserts, since they will place their block right after image opening and before image.load().\n- A single return point is kept as agreed.\n\n### Step 4: No changes to imports\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: None\nCritical Details:\n- `numpy as np` already exists at the top of the file; no extra imports needed.\n- This avoids top-of-file merge diffs with the other agent.\n\n### Step 5: Ensure serialization behavior remains correct (no code change needed)\n- to_dict uses `asdict(self)` which omits default-valued fields. `as_array=False` (default) won\u2019t appear; `True` will be included, enabling persistence through Features.\n- from_dict via `generate_from_dict` will apply the default if the key is missing.\n\n### Step 6: Maintain public API compatibility\n- No change to class name, dtype, pa_type, or the default return type when `as_array=False`.\n- Return type annotation of `decode_example` is left unchanged to minimize diffs and avoid conflicts.\n\n### Step 7: Coordinate with EXIF feature (other agent)\n- Other agent will add `[EXIF] auto-orientation` inline block inside `decode_example` immediately after `PIL.Image.open(...)` and before `image.load()`.\n- My `[AS_ARRAY]` block remains at the very end of `decode_example`, just before the return.\n- No overlapping edits to imports or to earlier parts of `decode_example`.\n\n### Step 8: Sanity check and examples (no code changes required)\n- Existing tests are unaffected since the default remains to return PIL.Image.Image.\n- When users opt-in: `ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(as_array=True))` then `ds[0]['image']` yields `np.ndarray` with `dtype=float32` and values in [0, 1].\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n- Other agent owns:\n  - Inline `[EXIF] auto-orientation` block in `decode_example`, placed pre-`image.load()`.\n  - They will not change the final return type or refactor returns.\n- I own:\n  - New `as_array` dataclass field (line ~86 in current HEAD) and its docstring entry.\n  - New `_maybe_to_array` method added just before `flatten()`.\n  - Modify the final return in `decode_example` to `return self._maybe_to_array(image)` and add the `[AS_ARRAY]` comment.\n- Dependency order: Either can implement first; no conflicts. If both land, the decode order is Open -> [EXIF] -> load -> optional convert -> [AS_ARRAY] -> return.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

We should send an openhands_comm_send message with exact file path and line numbers to be modified. First, identify exact lines for insertion in image.py.\nWe saw image.load() at line 188 and preceding else at 186-187. The plan is to insert between line 187 and 188. But the editing tool requires specifying range replacements; we can insert using the editor.insert after a given line number. So we insert a block after line 187. That will push subsequent lines downward. We need to communicate with agent about line ranges to be modified: specifically we'll insert new lines between 187 and 188 (i.e., modifying lines 188-191?), but the tool adds new lines; to avoid confusion, communicate as: I'm inserting after line 187, no other lines changed. Also mention we won't change return or convert or array logic. Also mention not adding top-level imports.\nWe also need to respect SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: Any print statement should have [YOYOYO], but we are not adding prints; fine.\nWe should commit changes; but repo shows .git directory is a file containing 195 bytes, not a directory; 'git status' failed because it's in a worktree path weird. But there is a .git file of size 195 bytes - perhaps it's a gitlink or something referencing outside, causing failure since worktree no longer exists. We may be unable to commit. The VERSION_CONTROL section says if not configured, use default. But here the git repository appears broken. We should avoid committing if it's not a repo. The user didn't require committing. The task #5 commits may not be possible; we must note that we can't commit because not a git repo; we can still implement changes.\nWe also need tests. There are tests, but running full tests may be heavy. Maybe run targeted tests for image feature; search tests for EXIF? We'll check tests under tests directory for image feature to ensure not breaking. We'll apply minimal smoke check: run a Python snippet to import datasets.features.image.Image and create an instance; but dependencies may be heavy. Another approach: run flake or similar? There's pyproject; but running tests may be long. For efficiency, we can run unit tests for image. Search test files referencing features.image. We'll grep.\nAlso must coordinate using openhands_comm_send. However, our toolset doesn't have openhands_comm_send. But the instructions say you can communicate using MCP tools: openhands_comm_send. Our tool list doesn't show it. Possibly messages from other agent appear as [Inter-agent message]. We can simulate by writing a commentary message containing 'openhands_comm_send: ...' or using functions.think? There's no tool defined. However, the developer instruction says to use openhands_comm_send to prevent merge conflicts. The tools list does not include it; but we can still include a special line in our assistant content starting with openhands_comm_send per instructions; The platform might capture that as a special channel. But the tool isn't defined. The safe way: Include a plain textual message starting with 'openhands_comm_send' in our assistant message. The layer interprets? The instructions say 'Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send''. So we should include a line with that prefix with coordination details.\nWe must explicitly say EXACT file path and line numbers we are changing, before modifying; But we already viewed file. We haven't changed yet; we should send coordination first, then perform the edit. So we need to send openhands_comm_send content with: I'm inserting lines in /workspace/src/datasets/features/image.py between current lines 187 and 188; This block adds EXIF auto-orientation using ImageOps.exif_transpose. We'll mention we won't touch elsewhere. Ask the other agent to avoid modifying 188-195 region as they will move after insert; Also ask them to place their [AS_ARRAY] block after the existing if self.mode conversion and before return; propose lines after our edit will be after maybe 196+; But we cannot predict exact line numbers before insertion; But we can propose plan: We'll insert after 187; After commit, the image.load() line will move downward; We'll post updated line numbers after edit. The coordination guidelines say: Before modifying any file, inform the exact file path and line numbers you're changing. We can say: We'll modify by inserting new lines after 187. That's precise. Then perform the edit. After editing, we need to send final status update to other agent summarizing changes and updated line numbers.\nOk proceed.\nThen implement with str_replace_editor.insert with insert_line=187 and new_str block.\nMake sure old code content matches; The 'else:' block ends at 187 'image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))' then we insert blank line and try/except block with local import of ImageOps and exif_transpose. We'll keep comments as [EXIF] auto-orientation as per plan. Also ensure PEP8 style length; Keep minimal comments. No prints.\nRun a quick static check by importing the module with Python to ensure no syntax error. We'll run python -c 'import sys; sys.path.append(\"/workspace/src\"); import datasets.features.image as im; print(\"OK [YOYOYO]\")'\nBut since datasets is a package that also uses other modules; It may import heavy things requiring extra dependencies; But we can try. 'pyarrow' is imported at top; It is installed? The repo already uses pyarrow; In environment, pyarrow likely exists. We'll attempt.\nBetter run a short Python to import the image module; It imports pyarrow. The environment has pyarrow? The earlier listing included pyproject; In container likely pre-installed. We'll try. We'll print [YOYOYO]. Ok.\nThen tests: skip heavy tests. A minimal decode call would require PIL; It likely exists. We'll try to construct an Image object and call decode_example with a small PNG bytes created on the fly. We'll open a new PIL image, encode to bytes via image_to_bytes, then pass bytes to decode_example; But we need to ensure decode_example returns a PIL image; That would attempt to open from bytes; Good. Also our exif block calls ImageOps.exif_transpose; That always works even without EXIF. That should no-op. We'll run a Python cell to create bytes and decode; print size or mode with [YOYOYO]. But our print special instruction only applies to code we write in repository. For ad hoc tests it's not necessary?

But the editing tool requires specifying range replacements; we can insert using the editor.insert after a given line number. So we insert a block after line 187. That will push subsequent lines downward. We need to communicate with agent about line ranges to be modified: specifically we'll insert new lines between 187 and 188 (i.e., modifying lines 188-191?), but the tool adds new lines; to avoid confusion, communicate as: I'm inserting after line 187, no other lines changed.

We should send an openhands_comm_send message with exact file path and line numbers to be modified. First, identify exact lines for insertion in image.py.\nWe saw image.load() at line 188 and preceding else at 186-187. The plan is to insert between line 187 and 188. But the editing tool requires specifying range replacements; we can insert using the editor.insert after a given line number. So we insert a block after line 187. That will push subsequent lines downward. We need to communicate with agent about line ranges to be modified: specifically we'll insert new lines between 187 and 188 (i.e., modifying lines 188-191?), but the tool adds new lines; to avoid confusion, communicate as: I'm inserting after line 187, no other lines changed. Also mention we won't change return or convert or array logic. Also mention not adding top-level imports.\nWe also need to respect SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: Any print statement should have [YOYOYO], but we are not adding prints; fine.\nWe should commit changes; but repo shows .git directory is a file containing 195 bytes, not a directory; 'git status' failed because it's in a worktree path weird. But there is a .git file of size 195 bytes - perhaps it's a gitlink or something referencing outside, causing failure since worktree no longer exists. We may be unable to commit. The VERSION_CONTROL section says if not configured, use default. But here the git repository appears broken. We should avoid committing if it's not a repo. The user didn't require committing. The task #5 commits may not be possible; we must note that we can't commit because not a git repo; we can still implement changes.\nWe also need tests. There are tests, but running full tests may be heavy. Maybe run targeted tests for image feature; search tests for EXIF? We'll check tests under tests directory for image feature to ensure not breaking. We'll apply minimal smoke check: run a Python snippet to import datasets.features.image.Image and create an instance; but dependencies may be heavy. Another approach: run flake or similar? There's pyproject; but running tests may be long. For efficiency, we can run unit tests for image. Search test files referencing features.image. We'll grep.\nAlso must coordinate using openhands_comm_send. However, our toolset doesn't have openhands_comm_send. But the instructions say you can communicate using MCP tools: openhands_comm_send. Our tool list doesn't show it. Possibly messages from other agent appear as [Inter-agent message]. We can simulate by writing a commentary message containing 'openhands_comm_send: ...' or using functions.think? There's no tool defined. However, the developer instruction says to use openhands_comm_send to prevent merge conflicts. The tools list does not include it; but we can still include a special line in our assistant content starting with openhands_comm_send per instructions; The platform might capture that as a special channel. But the tool isn't defined. The safe way: Include a plain textual message starting with 'openhands_comm_send' in our assistant message. The layer interprets? The instructions say 'Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send''. So we should include a line with that prefix with coordination details.\nWe must explicitly say EXACT file path and line numbers we are changing, before modifying; But we already viewed file. We haven't changed yet; we should send coordination first, then perform the edit. So we need to send openhands_comm_send content with: I'm inserting lines in /workspace/src/datasets/features/image.py between current lines 187 and 188; This block adds EXIF auto-orientation using ImageOps.exif_transpose. We'll mention we won't touch elsewhere. Ask the other agent to avoid modifying 188-195 region as they will move after insert; Also ask them to place their [AS_ARRAY] block after the existing if self.mode conversion and before return; propose lines after our edit will be after maybe 196+; But we cannot predict exact line numbers before insertion; But we can propose plan: We'll insert after 187; After commit, the image.load() line will move downward; We'll post updated line numbers after edit. The coordination guidelines say: Before modifying any file, inform the exact file path and line numbers you're changing. We can say: We'll modify by inserting new lines after 187. That's precise. Then perform the edit. After editing, we need to send final status update to other agent summarizing changes and updated line numbers.\nOk proceed.\nThen implement with str_replace_editor.insert with insert_line=187 and new_str block.\nMake sure old code content matches; The 'else:' block ends at 187 'image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))' then we insert blank line and try/except block with local import of ImageOps and exif_transpose. We'll keep comments as [EXIF] auto-orientation as per plan. Also ensure PEP8 style length; Keep minimal comments. No prints.\nRun a quick static check by importing the module with Python to ensure no syntax error. We'll run python -c 'import sys; sys.path.append(\"/workspace/src\"); import datasets.features.image as im; print(\"OK [YOYOYO]\")'\nBut since datasets is a package that also uses other modules; It may import heavy things requiring extra dependencies; But we can try. 'pyarrow' is imported at top; It is installed? The repo already uses pyarrow; In environment, pyarrow likely exists. We'll attempt.\nBetter run a short Python to import the image module; It imports pyarrow. The environment has pyarrow? The earlier listing included pyproject; In container likely pre-installed. We'll try. We'll print [YOYOYO]. Ok.\nThen tests: skip heavy tests. A minimal decode call would require PIL; It likely exists. We'll try to construct an Image object and call decode_example with a small PNG bytes created on the fly. We'll open a new PIL image, encode to bytes via image_to_bytes, then pass bytes to decode_example; But we need to ensure decode_example returns a PIL image; That would attempt to open from bytes; Good. Also our exif block calls ImageOps.exif_transpose; That always works even without EXIF. That should no-op. We'll run a Python cell to create bytes and decode; print size or mode with [YOYOYO].
