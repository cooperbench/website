Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature2\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:39:40.677720\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Many image datasets have non-square aspect ratios. Some CV models require square inputs. Users currently perform center-cropping outside the datasets library.\n- Goal: Add an optional crop_to_square flag to the Image feature so decoded images can be center-cropped to a square automatically during decode.\n- Requirements:\n  - Add a new dataclass field crop_to_square: bool = False (opt-in, default off).\n  - Apply center-crop before any mode conversion and before other transforms.\n  - Maintain backward compatibility when crop_to_square is False.\n  - Coordinate with another feature adding an auto CMYK->RGB conversion in decode_example.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Class: Image (src/datasets/features/image.py) handles encoding and decoding of images.\n- We will modify only src/datasets/features/image.py.\n- Center-crop logic will be placed immediately after image.load() and before any mode conversion. It must be bounded by comments to avoid merge conflicts.\n- Coordination with Other Agent (CMYK->RGB): Final order in decode_example must be:\n  1) image.load()\n  2) center-crop-to-square (this feature)\n  3) CMYK->RGB conversion (other agent)\n  4) user-specified conversion via self.mode\n- Backward compatibility: with crop_to_square=False (default), behavior is unchanged.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add dataclass field crop_to_square and update Image docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Class docstring Args section (around lines 62-69) and dataclass fields (around lines 84-91)\nAction: Modify (insert new argument description and new dataclass field)\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature2\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:39:40.677720\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Many image datasets have non-square aspect ratios. Some CV models require square inputs. Users currently perform center-cropping outside the datasets library.\n- Goal: Add an optional crop_to_square flag to the Image feature so decoded images can be center-cropped to a square automatically during decode.\n- Requirements:\n  - Add a new dataclass field crop_to_square: bool = False (opt-in, default off).\n  - Apply center-crop before any mode conversion and before other transforms.\n  - Maintain backward compatibility when crop_to_square is False.\n  - Coordinate with another feature adding an auto CMYK->RGB conversion in decode_example.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Class: Image (src/datasets/features/image.py) handles encoding and decoding of images.\n- We will modify only src/datasets/features/image.py.\n- Center-crop logic will be placed immediately after image.load() and before any mode conversion. It must be bounded by comments to avoid merge conflicts.\n- Coordination with Other Agent (CMYK->RGB): Final order in decode_example must be:\n  1) image.load()\n  2) center-crop-to-square (this feature)\n  3) CMYK->RGB conversion (other agent)\n  4) user-specified conversion via self.mode\n- Backward compatibility: with crop_to_square=False (default), behavior is unchanged.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add dataclass field crop_to_square and update Image docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Class docstring Args section (around lines 62-69) and dataclass fields (around lines 84-91)\nAction: Modify (insert new argument description and new dataclass field)\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format {\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}.\n```\nAfter Code (replace the Args block with the following, leaving existing text intact and adding the new arg):\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format {\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            If `True`, center-crop the decoded image to a square using the shorter side\n            before any mode conversion or other transforms. The crop is applied only during\n            decoding and does not affect stored bytes/paths.\n```\n\nBefore Code (dataclass fields excerpt around lines 84-91):\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nAfter Code (insert new field between decode and id):\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep default as False to preserve behavior.\n- Do not modify any other fields or class variables.\n\n### Step 2: Insert center-crop block in decode_example after image.load()\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: In Image.decode_example, immediately after `image.load()` (currently line 188), before any conversion. If the CMYK->RGB block from the other agent exists, insert this block above it.\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code (excerpt around lines 186-191):\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code (insert the center-crop block, bounded by comments, and keep the existing conversion block untouched):\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n\n        # Optional center-crop to square (applied before any mode conversion)\n        if getattr(self, \"crop_to_square\", False):\n            w, h = image.size\n            if w != h:\n                side = w if w < h else h\n                left = (w - side) // 2\n                top = (h - side) // 2\n                right = left + side\n                bottom = top + side\n                image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n        # End center-crop block\n\n        # [CMYK->RGB conversion block by other agent is expected to be placed here]\n\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Use integer arithmetic to avoid float coordinates.\n- Only crop when crop_to_square is True and the image is not already square.\n- Keep explicit bounding comments to clearly separate this block for coordination.\n\n### Step 3: No changes to encoding or storage methods\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: None (explicit)\nCritical Details:\n- The encode_example, cast_storage, embed_storage, and other functions remain unchanged to preserve existing behavior.\n\n### Step 4: Coordinate line positioning with the other agent\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: Ensure ordering and anchors are respected\n- After both features are merged, the decode_example order must be:\n  1) `image.load()`\n  2) This center-crop block (bounded by comments)\n  3) The other agent\u2019s CMYK->RGB block (commented as: `# Auto-convert CMYK to RGB prior to any user-specified conversion`)\n  4) Existing `if self.mode ...` conversion\n- If their block already exists right after `image.load()`, insert this block above it. The anchor comments will help avoid conflicts.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership:\n  - I own: `src/datasets/features/image.py` modifications to dataclass signature, docstring, and the center-crop block in `decode_example`.\n  - Other agent owns: `src/datasets/features/image.py` insertion of the CMYK->RGB conversion block located between my crop block and the existing `self.mode` conversion. They do not touch the dataclass or docstring.\n- Line positioning:\n  - My crop block sits immediately after `image.load()` and is bounded by:\n    - Start: `# Optional center-crop to square (applied before any mode conversion)`\n    - End: `# End center-crop block`\n  - Other agent will place their CMYK->RGB block immediately after my end comment and before the `if self.mode ...` block.\n- Dependency order:\n  - Other agent indicated they will implement first by adding their CMYK->RGB conversion after `image.load()`.\n  - I will then place my crop block above theirs, preserving the agreed final order. If I implement first, I will still leave a placeholder comment indicating where their block should go.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Many downstream vision models and tools expect RGB images and may error or render incorrectly when receiving CMYK.\n- Goal: Automatically convert any CMYK images to RGB during decode so downstream components always receive RGB when input was CMYK, without requiring users to set `mode`.\n- Requirements:\n  - No API change.\n  - Apply conversion in the decode path only.\n  - Respect coordination with the other agent adding optional center-cropping. Final order in `decode_example` must be: `image.load()` -> center-crop (if enabled by the other agent) -> CMYK\u2192RGB conversion (this feature) -> user-specified conversion (`self.mode`).\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File impacted: `src/datasets/features/image.py` only.\n- Implementation point: Inside `Image.decode_example`, directly after `image.load()` and before the existing `if self.mode ... convert(...)` block.\n- Conversion logic: Check `if image.mode == \"CMYK\": image = image.convert(\"RGB\")`.\n- Comments: Add a clear comment header `# Auto-convert CMYK to RGB prior to any user-specified conversion`.\n- Ordering with the other agent:\n  - I will place my conversion block immediately after `image.load()` (current line numbers shown below).

I insert my block starting at new line 189.\n  - Other agent will insert their crop block directly above my comment `# Auto-convert CMYK to RGB prior to any user-specified conversion` and will bound it with comments:\n    - `# Optional center-crop to square (applied before any mode conversion)`\n    - `# End center-crop block`\n- Dependency order:\n  - I implement first (this plan). The other agent then adds their crop block and dataclass/docstring updates.

Many downstream vision models and tools expect RGB images and may error or render incorrectly when receiving CMYK.\n- Goal: Automatically convert any CMYK images to RGB during decode so downstream components always receive RGB when input was CMYK, without requiring users to set `mode`.\n- Requirements:\n  - No API change.\n  - Apply conversion in the decode path only.\n  - Respect coordination with the other agent adding optional center-cropping. Final order in `decode_example` must be: `image.load()` -> center-crop (if enabled by the other agent) -> CMYK\u2192RGB conversion (this feature) -> user-specified conversion (`self.mode`).\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File impacted: `src/datasets/features/image.py` only.\n- Implementation point: Inside `Image.decode_example`, directly after `image.load()` and before the existing `if self.mode ... convert(...)` block.\n- Conversion logic: Check `if image.mode == \"CMYK\": image = image.convert(\"RGB\")`.\n- Comments: Add a clear comment header `# Auto-convert CMYK to RGB prior to any user-specified conversion`.\n- Ordering with the other agent:\n  - I will place my conversion block immediately after `image.load()` (current line numbers shown below).
