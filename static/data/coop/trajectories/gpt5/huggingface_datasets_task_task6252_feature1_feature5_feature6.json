Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Users often need images as normalized float32 NumPy arrays in [0, 1]. The Image feature currently always returns PIL.Image on decode, requiring extra conversion steps.\nGoal: Add an option Image(as_array=True) that makes decode_example return a NumPy array (dtype=float32) normalized to [0, 1]. Default behavior remains unchanged (PIL.Image.Image).\nRequirements:\n- Add as_array: bool = False to Image dataclass\n- When as_array=True, decode_example returns np.ndarray (float32) with values in [0, 1]\n- Work alongside two other changes in the same function: EXIF orientation fix (Agent 1) and CMYK->RGB with target_mode refactor (Agent 3)\n- Update type hints and docstrings accordingly\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared for src/datasets/features/image.py. I will add the as_array flag, update type hints/docstrings, and append the normalization block after the mode conversion section.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: Adds EXIF orientation correction immediately after image.load(), before any mode conversion.\n- Agent 3: Inserts CMYK->RGB guard and refactors the mode conversion block to use target_mode. Their block sits after EXIF and before the mode conversion.\nShared File Strategy:\n- I will not modify or rely on their variables (except acknowledging that the mode conversion block may be refactored). My normalization block will be placed strictly AFTER the mode conversion block (either the original or the refactored target_mode version). I\u2019ll wrap my block with BEGIN/END comments. I will also update the Image class field list and function signature/docstrings in non-overlapping sections.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: This change is a decoding-time post-processing path within Image.decode_example(). It does not alter Arrow storage, encode paths, or pa_type. It only affects the Python-returned object when decode=True.\nCritical Notes:\n- Keep dtype ClassVar and pa_type unchanged for backward compatibility.\n- Type hint for decode_example will be updated to Union[PIL.Image.Image, np.ndarray].\n- Normalization rules:\n  - Unsigned ints: arr.astype(np.float32) / iinfo.max\n  - Signed ints: (arr.astype(np.float32) - iinfo.min) / (iinfo.max - iinfo.min)\n  - Bool: arr.astype(np.float32) (already 0/1)\n  - Floats: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1]\n- Place normalization AFTER all image conversions (EXIF transpose, CMYK guard, and final mode conversion), so it reflects the final image state.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array flag to Image dataclass and extend class docstring Args\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared (I own this exact addition block)\nLocation: Around lines 84-91 (fields section under the Image dataclass)\nAction: Modify (insert a new field after `decode` and update the class docstring Args section)\nBefore Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAnd fields:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Compatible with both the original 2-line mode conversion and the refactored target_mode version from Agent 3.\nLocation: Immediately after the mode conversion section in decode_example() (currently after lines 189-191). If Agent 3\u2019s refactor is present, place this after the block marked `# END MODE-CONVERSION-WITH-TARGET`.\nAction: Add\nBefore Code (current local section):\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # (Agent 1) EXIF orientation correction is expected here\n        # (Agent 3) CMYK->RGB and target_mode logic is expected before mode conversion\n\n        # Existing or refactored mode conversion block remains here\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # BEGIN AS-ARRAY-NORMALIZATION\n        if self.as_array:\n            arr = np.asarray(image)\n            if arr.dtype == np.bool_:\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n            elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.unsignedinteger):\n                denom = np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / float(denom)\n            elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.signedinteger):\n                info = np.iinfo(arr.dtype)\n                arr = (arr.astype(np.float32) - float(info.min)) / float(info.max - info.min)\n            else:\n                # float types or other numeric dtypes\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n                arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            return arr\n        # END AS-ARRAY-NORMALIZATION\n\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- This block must be placed after the mode conversion handling, regardless of whether the original or Agent 3\u2019s refactored version is present.\n- The code path returns early when `self.as_array` is True.\n- Handles boolean, unsigned int, signed int, and float image arrays robustly.\n- No additional imports required; `np` is already imported at the top of the file.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_5 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Option to Normalize Image Pixels to Float32 NumPy Array\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces support for normalizing image pixel values by converting them into a `float32` NumPy array scaled to the range [0, 1], controlled by a new `as_array` flag in the `Image` feature. This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Users often need images as normalized float32 NumPy arrays in [0, 1]. The Image feature currently always returns PIL.Image on decode, requiring extra conversion steps.\nGoal: Add an option Image(as_array=True) that makes decode_example return a NumPy array (dtype=float32) normalized to [0, 1]. Default behavior remains unchanged (PIL.Image.Image).\nRequirements:\n- Add as_array: bool = False to Image dataclass\n- When as_array=True, decode_example returns np.ndarray (float32) with values in [0, 1]\n- Work alongside two other changes in the same function: EXIF orientation fix (Agent 1) and CMYK->RGB with target_mode refactor (Agent 3)\n- Update type hints and docstrings accordingly\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared for src/datasets/features/image.py. I will add the as_array flag, update type hints/docstrings, and append the normalization block after the mode conversion section.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: Adds EXIF orientation correction immediately after image.load(), before any mode conversion.\n- Agent 3: Inserts CMYK->RGB guard and refactors the mode conversion block to use target_mode. Their block sits after EXIF and before the mode conversion.\nShared File Strategy:\n- I will not modify or rely on their variables (except acknowledging that the mode conversion block may be refactored). My normalization block will be placed strictly AFTER the mode conversion block (either the original or the refactored target_mode version). I\u2019ll wrap my block with BEGIN/END comments. I will also update the Image class field list and function signature/docstrings in non-overlapping sections.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: This change is a decoding-time post-processing path within Image.decode_example(). It does not alter Arrow storage, encode paths, or pa_type. It only affects the Python-returned object when decode=True.\nCritical Notes:\n- Keep dtype ClassVar and pa_type unchanged for backward compatibility.\n- Type hint for decode_example will be updated to Union[PIL.Image.Image, np.ndarray].\n- Normalization rules:\n  - Unsigned ints: arr.astype(np.float32) / iinfo.max\n  - Signed ints: (arr.astype(np.float32) - iinfo.min) / (iinfo.max - iinfo.min)\n  - Bool: arr.astype(np.float32) (already 0/1)\n  - Floats: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1]\n- Place normalization AFTER all image conversions (EXIF transpose, CMYK guard, and final mode conversion), so it reflects the final image state.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array flag to Image dataclass and extend class docstring Args\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared (I own this exact addition block)\nLocation: Around lines 84-91 (fields section under the Image dataclass)\nAction: Modify (insert a new field after `decode` and update the class docstring Args section)\nBefore Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata load with incorrect orientation when decoded via PIL in datasets.features.Image, causing rotated/flipped visuals and inconsistent spatial dimensions.\nGoal: Automatically apply EXIF orientation correction during decoding so returned PIL images have correct orientation by default.\nRequirements: \n- Integrate EXIF correction into Image.decode_example without changing user-facing defaults.\n- Apply correction after PIL opens and loads the image, and before any further conversions.\n- Avoid interfering with other agents\u2019 planned changes (CMYK->RGB, as_array feature) and prevent merge conflicts.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: \n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- I only add an EXIF orientation correction block inside Image.decode_example().
