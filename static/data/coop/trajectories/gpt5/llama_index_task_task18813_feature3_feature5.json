Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

They currently compute size manually by seeking the buffer, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n- Goal: Add new helper variants that return a tuple (BytesIO, int) for images, audio, and documents, without altering existing resolve_* methods or changing behavior for backward compatibility.\n- Requirements:\n  - Implement resolve_image_with_size(), resolve_audio_with_size(), resolve_document_with_size() alongside existing methods in the same classes.\n  - Return type: Tuple[BytesIO, int] providing the buffer and byte count.\n  - Do not modify existing resolve_* methods.\n  - Ensure buffer cursor position is preserved when computing size.\n  - Keep imports unchanged unless necessary; no __all__ in this file.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File ownership and coordination:\n  - Shared file: llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n  - Other agent will first modify:\n    - typing import block (insert Callable)\n    - AudioBlock.resolve_audio signature and internals to accept on_resolve callback.

This provides both the resolved buffer and its byte size in a single call.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nConsumers of the `resolve_*` methods often need to determine the size of the resolved content. Currently, this requires manually seeking the buffer, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n\n**Solution**:\nImplement new method variants that encapsulate both resolution and size calculation. The original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged for backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n* llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for llama_index_task_task18813_feature3\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T16:12:37.318414\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Callers often need both the resolved buffer and its byte size from resolve_* methods. They currently compute size manually by seeking the buffer, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n- Goal: Add new helper variants that return a tuple (BytesIO, int) for images, audio, and documents, without altering existing resolve_* methods or changing behavior for backward compatibility.\n- Requirements:\n  - Implement resolve_image_with_size(), resolve_audio_with_size(), resolve_document_with_size() alongside existing methods in the same classes.\n  - Return type: Tuple[BytesIO, int] providing the buffer and byte count.\n  - Do not modify existing resolve_* methods.\n  - Ensure buffer cursor position is preserved when computing size.\n  - Keep imports unchanged unless necessary; no __all__ in this file.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File ownership and coordination:\n  - Shared file: llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n  - Other agent will first modify:\n    - typing import block (insert Callable)\n    - AudioBlock.resolve_audio signature and internals to accept on_resolve callback. They will not relocate functions.\n  - I will then add new with_size helper methods immediately after each corresponding resolve_* method inside the same class. I will not touch imports or the modified resolve_audio.\n- Size calculation approach:\n  - Prefer len(buf.getbuffer()) when available.\n  - Fallback: save position = buf.tell(); seek to end; size = buf.tell(); restore position.\n- Placement:\n  - ImageBlock: add resolve_image_with_size() after resolve_image()\n  - AudioBlock: add resolve_audio_with_size() after resolve_audio()\n  - DocumentBlock: add resolve_document_with_size() after resolve_document() and before _get_b64_string()\n- Type hints: Return Tuple[BytesIO, int]. Since typing.Tuple is not imported explicitly, use from typing import Tuple if needed; but Python 3.10+ supports tuple[int, ...] syntax. To avoid import churn and remain consistent with style, use tuple[BytesIO, int]. No extra imports needed.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add resolve_image_with_size helper\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Inside class `ImageBlock`, immediately after the existing `resolve_image` method. In current file after the other agent's change, `resolve_image` ends at line 127; insert starting at line 128.\nAction: Add\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple[BytesIO, int]: (buffer, size_in_bytes)\n        \"\"\"\n        buf = self.resolve_image(as_base64=as_base64)\n        # Compute size without disturbing caller's read position\n        try:\n            size = len(buf.getbuffer())\n        except Exception:\n            pos = buf.tell()\n            buf.seek(0, 2)\n            size = buf.tell()\n            buf.seek(pos)\n        return buf, size\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Do not modify existing resolve_image.\n- Keep indentation aligned with class methods.\n\n### Step 2: Add resolve_audio_with_size helper\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Inside class `AudioBlock`, immediately after the updated `resolve_audio` method. After the other agent's change, `resolve_audio` ends at line 197; insert starting at line 198.\nAction: Add\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def resolve_audio_with_size(\n        self,\n        as_base64: bool = False,\n    ) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve audio and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple[BytesIO, int]: (buffer, size_in_bytes)\n        \"\"\"\n        buf = self.resolve_audio(as_base64=as_base64)\n        try:\n            size = len(buf.getbuffer())\n        except Exception:\n            pos = buf.tell()\n            buf.seek(0, 2)\n            size = buf.tell()\n            buf.seek(pos)\n        return buf, size\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Do not pass or depend on the other agent's on_resolve callback; simply call self.resolve_audio so we inherit any fixes.\n- Keep method inside AudioBlock.\n\n### Step 3: Add resolve_document_with_size helper\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Inside class `DocumentBlock`, immediately after `resolve_document` and before `_get_b64_string`. After the other agent's change, `resolve_document` ends at line 235; insert starting at line 236.\nAction: Add\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def resolve_document_with_size(self) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve a document and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple[BytesIO, int]: (buffer, size_in_bytes)\n        \"\"\"\n        buf = self.resolve_document()\n        try:\n            size = len(buf.getbuffer())\n        except Exception:\n            pos = buf.tell()\n            buf.seek(0, 2)\n            size = buf.tell()\n            buf.seek(pos)\n        return buf, size\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Ensure placement before private helpers `_get_b64_string` and `_get_b64_bytes` to match requested location.\n\n### Step 4: Ensure no import changes or __all__ edits\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Top of file\nAction: Verify no additional imports needed. We use tuple[...] typing which needs no import. Do not change import lines.\nCritical Details:\n- This avoids conflicts with the other agent\u2019s import change.\n\n### Step 5: Minimal docstrings and consistency\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nAction: Ensure docstrings align with existing style. No changes to other methods.\nCritical Details:\n- Keep naming consistently `resolve_*_with_size`.\n\n### Step 6: Run static checks (conceptual)\n- Ensure functions return (BytesIO, int) and do not mutate buffer position after computing size.\n- Ensure no reformatting alters other agent\u2019s touched lines.\n\n### Step 7: Dependency order\n- Wait for the other agent\u2019s changes to land first (they modify imports and resolve_audio). Then apply Steps 1-3 so line positions match agreed plan.\n\n### Step 8: Coordination Notes and Ownership\n- Other agent handles:\n  - Typing import block (insert Callable)\n  - AudioBlock.resolve_audio() signature/body modification, lines 173-186 replaced (ends ~line 197 afterwards)\n- I own additions:\n  - ImageBlock.resolve_image_with_size() at line ~128\n  - AudioBlock.resolve_audio_with_size() at line ~198\n  - DocumentBlock.resolve_document_with_size() at line ~236\n- Shared file: types.py, but non-overlapping regions as coordinated.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "action": "system", "args": {"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enhancement supports UI progress indicators, logging, and custom metric collection.\n\n**Description**\nThis feature allows developers to pass a progress hook via the `on_resolve` parameter when calling `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()`. The callback receives the byte count of the resolved audio buffer, providing visibility into data size at runtime. This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nConsumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.\n\n**Solution**\nAn optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for llama_index_task_task18813_feature5\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T16:12:37.319069\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Consumers of audio blocks need insight into processed data size during resolution without duplicating logic.\n- Goal: Add an optional callback hook to AudioBlock.resolve_audio() that receives the final byte size of the resolved BytesIO buffer.\n- Requirements:\n  - Modify only llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n  - Add on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] parameter to resolve_audio()\n  - Call the callback with the final buffer size after resolving\n  - Backward compatible; do not change resolve_image() or resolve_document()\n  - Do not move/relocate functions\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- The buffer resolution is delegated to llama_index.core.utils.resolve_binary which returns a BytesIO.\n- Compute final size using len(buf.getbuffer()). Provide a safe fallback using seek/tell to handle any edge cases while preserving cursor position.\n- Add Callable to typing imports; no other import or __all__ changes.\n- After this change, the other agent will add with_size helper methods immediately after existing resolve_* methods inside each class.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Update typing imports to add Callable\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 9-19 (within the existing `from typing import (...)` block)\nAction: Modify (insert `Callable,` after `Any,`)\nBefore Code:\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\nAfter Code:\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    Callable,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\nCritical Details: Do not add new lines or reorder existing names beyond inserting `Callable,` to avoid shifting line numbers unnecessarily.\n\n### Step 2: Replace AudioBlock.resolve_audio() to include on_resolve callback\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 173-186 (replace entire method body and signature in place; do not relocate)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code (Lines 173-186):\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\nAfter Code (Replace Lines 173-186 with):\n    def resolve_audio(\n        self,\n        as_base64: bool = False,\n        on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None,\n    ) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio buffer.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n            on_resolve (Optional[Callable[[int], None]]): optional callback invoked with the final byte length\n                of the resolved audio buffer.\n        \"\"\"\n        buf = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n        if on_resolve is not None:\n            try:\n                size = len(buf.getbuffer())\n            except Exception:\n                pos = buf.tell()\n                buf.seek(0, 2)\n                size = buf.tell()\n                buf.seek(pos)\n            on_resolve(size)\n        return buf\nCritical Details:\n- Keep method in the same class and location.\n- Maintain backward compatibility: the first positional parameter after `self` remains `as_base64`, and `on_resolve` is optional.\n- Ensure the buffer cursor position is restored after the fallback size computation.\n\n### Step 3: Run static checks and format\nFile: N/A\nLocation: N/A\nAction: Run linters/formatters to ensure imports and code style are compliant (e.g., ruff/black).\nCritical Details: No functional change; ensure no additional reordering of imports that could shift line numbers referenced by the other agent.\n\n### Step 4: Verify local behavior manually (sanity check)\nFile: N/A\nAction: Quick REPL test snippet (not committed):\n- Create AudioBlock(audio=b\"abc\") and call resolve_audio(on_resolve=print) -> should print 3.\n- Create AudioBlock(audio=base64.b64encode(b\"abcd\")) and call resolve_audio(on_resolve=print) -> should print 4.\n- Call resolve_audio(True, on_resolve=print) -> size should reflect base64-encoded bytes length.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership and order agreed with the other agent:\n  - Mine: types.py import edit (lines 9-19) and resolve_audio() replacement (lines 173-186). I land first.\n  - Theirs: additive helpers only:\n    \u2022 ImageBlock.resolve_image_with_size(): immediately after ImageBlock.resolve_image() (which ends at line 127).\n    \u2022 AudioBlock.resolve_audio_with_size(): immediately after updated AudioBlock.resolve_audio() (which will end around line 197 after my change).\n    \u2022 DocumentBlock.resolve_document_with_size(): immediately after DocumentBlock.resolve_document() (which will end around line 235 after my change), before _get_b64_string().\n- I will not alter resolve_image() or resolve_document() and will not touch any exports.\n- No additional imports beyond adding Callable; no __all__ present.\n- If linting shifts exact line numbers slightly, the invariant remains: their helper methods must be placed immediately after the corresponding resolve_* method within each class.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

The callback receives the byte count of the resolved audio buffer, providing visibility into data size at runtime. This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nConsumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.\n\n**Solution**\nAn optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for llama_index_task_task18813_feature5\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T16:12:37.319069\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Consumers of audio blocks need insight into processed data size during resolution without duplicating logic.\n- Goal: Add an optional callback hook to AudioBlock.resolve_audio() that receives the final byte size of the resolved BytesIO buffer.\n- Requirements:\n  - Modify only llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n  - Add on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] parameter to resolve_audio()\n  - Call the callback with the final buffer size after resolving\n  - Backward compatible; do not change resolve_image() or resolve_document()\n  - Do not move/relocate functions\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- The buffer resolution is delegated to llama_index.core.utils.resolve_binary which returns a BytesIO.\n- Compute final size using len(buf.getbuffer()).

Import block and your edited lines 173\u2013186 were not touched.\n  - Behavior: Calls resolve_audio(as_base64), computes size using len(buf.getbuffer()) with a safe seek/tell fallback, returns (buf, size).\n\n- Added resolve_document_with_size(self) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]\n  - Placement: Immediately after DocumentBlock.resolve_document and before _get_b64_string\n  - Current file lines: 265\u2013280\n  - Behavior: Calls resolve_document(), computes size using len(buf.getbuffer()) with a safe seek/tell fallback, returns (buf, size).\n\nImportant coordination details\n- I did not modify any existing resolve_* methods; all helpers are new methods placed immediately after their corresponding resolve_* functions, as requested for backward compatibility.\n- I did not change imports. You added Callable in the import block lines 9\u201319; I left those lines intact.\n- Your changes to AudioBlock.resolve_audio at lines 173\u2013186 remain untouched on my branch. My audio helper is placed below resolve_audio without overlap.\n- Anchors in your environment vs mine differ slightly. To avoid conflicts, I ensured all my insertions are in non-overlapping regions relative to your specified edited ranges:\n  - Your edited ranges: 9\u201319 (typing imports), 173\u2013186 (resolve_audio with on_resolve).\n  - My helper placements: 128\u2013146 (image), 207\u2013225 (audio), 265\u2013280 (document).\n\nVerification\n- Local inspections confirm:\n  - Image helper is immediately after resolve_image.\n  - Audio helper is immediately after resolve_audio\u2019s return block in my file and does not overlap your 173\u2013186 change.\n  - Document helper sits between resolve_document and _get_b64_string.\n- No tests or linting run due to environment limitations and repo not being a valid git worktree here.
