Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`.

This can lead to errors or incorrect colors downstream.\n- Goal: Automatically convert any decoded CMYK images to RGB so downstream components always receive RGB images.\n- Requirement: Avoid merge conflicts with Agent 1\u2019s EXIF orientation feature by not editing the decode/open/load logic. Provide a private post-processing hook that Agent 1 will call from the decode path.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Add a private instance method on Image that normalizes decoded PIL images. It will:\n  - If the PIL image mode is \"CMYK\", convert to \"RGB\" using Pillow\u2019s standard convert.\n  - Otherwise, return the image unchanged.\n- No new imports needed (PIL is already a dependency for this file and guarded by config.PIL_AVAILABLE in decode).\n- Type hints will use forward references \"PIL.Image.Image\" to avoid import-time overhead.\n- Agent 1 will call this hook inside the decode path after EXIF transpose and any initial convert/open operations, right before returning the image.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add private post-processing hook method to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Inside class `Image`, after the existing `embed_storage` method ends. In the current file version, insert starting at new line 284 (i.e., immediately after line 283 which contains `return array_cast(storage, self.pa_type)`), before the class dedents and module-level functions begin.\nAction: Add\nBefore Code (ending lines of the `embed_storage` method):\n```\n        storage = pa.StructArray.from_arrays([bytes_array, path_array], [\"bytes\", \"path\"], mask=bytes_array.is_null())\n        return array_cast(storage, self.pa_type)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        storage = pa.StructArray.from_arrays([bytes_array, path_array], [\"bytes\", \"path\"], mask=bytes_array.is_null())\n        return array_cast(storage, self.pa_type)\n\n    def _postprocess_decoded_image(self, image: \"PIL.Image.Image\") -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n        \"\"\"Internal hook to normalize decoded PIL images.\n\n        Currently performs:\n        - Automatic CMYK \u2192 RGB conversion to ensure downstream compatibility.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Only convert when the image is explicitly in CMYK mode.\n        # Leave other modes (e.g., RGB, RGBA, L, P, YCbCr) untouched.\n        try:\n            if hasattr(image, \"mode\") and image.mode == \"CMYK\":\n                return image.convert(\"RGB\")\n        except Exception:\n            # Be conservative: if conversion fails for any reason, return the original image.\n            return image\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the indentation level consistent (method is part of the Image class). Leave a blank line after the method if the project\u2019s style enforces it.\n- Do not add imports.

If line numbers shift due to Agent 1\u2019s changes, the anchor is: place the new method immediately after the closing lines of `def embed_storage(...)` and before any module-level functions (e.g., `def list_image_compression_formats`).\n- Dependency/order\n  - Agent 1 will implement EXIF transpose and insert the call site first, then I will add this hook method (or vice versa is safe because the method name and placement are agreed; however, to avoid CI errors from a missing symbol, it\u2019s preferable that I add the method promptly and Agent 1 references it afterward).\n- Call site for Agent 1 (for clarity; they implement this):\n  - In `decode_example`, after EXIF handling and any initial conversion, right before returning the image, add:\n    `image = self._postprocess_decoded_image(image)`\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This is safe even before the other agent adds the hook since we guard with hasattr.\n- Safety:\n  - Use hasattr(ImageOps, \"exif_transpose\") and a try/except around the transpose to avoid failures on older Pillow or malformed EXIF.\n  - Do not modify any other behavior beyond adding EXIF correction and the optional hook call.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Modify EXIF handling and add post-processing hook call in Image.decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 155-191 (inside `Image.decode_example`)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n\n        if token_per_repo_id is None:\n            token_per_repo_id = {}\n\n        path, bytes_ = value[\"path\"], value[\"bytes\"]\n        if bytes_ is None:\n            if path is None:\n                raise ValueError(f\"An image should have one of 'path' or 'bytes' but both are None in {value}.\")\n            else:\n                if is_local_path(path):\n                    image = PIL.Image.open(path)\n                else:\n                    source_url = path.split(\"::\")[-1]\n                    pattern = (\n                        config.HUB_DATASETS_URL\n                        if source_url.startswith(config.HF_ENDPOINT)\n                        else config.HUB_DATASETS_HFFS_URL\n                    )\n                    try:\n                        repo_id = string_to_dict(source_url, pattern)[\"repo_id\"]\n                        token = token_per_repo_id.get(repo_id)\n                    except ValueError:\n                        token = None\n                    download_config = DownloadConfig(token=token)\n                    with xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n                        bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\n                    image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n            from PIL import ImageOps\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n\n        if token_per_repo_id is None:\n            token_per_repo_id = {}\n\n        path, bytes_ = value[\"path\"], value[\"bytes\"]\n        if bytes_ is None:\n            if path is None:\n                raise ValueError(f\"An image should have one of 'path' or 'bytes' but both are None in {value}.\")\n            else:\n                if is_local_path(path):\n                    image = PIL.Image.open(path)\n                else:\n                    source_url = path.split(\"::\")[-1]\n                    pattern = (\n                        config.HUB_DATASETS_URL\n                        if source_url.startswith(config.HF_ENDPOINT)\n                        else config.HUB_DATASETS_HFFS_URL\n                    )\n                    try:\n                        repo_id = string_to_dict(source_url, pattern)[\"repo_id\"]\n                        token = token_per_repo_id.get(repo_id)\n                    except ValueError:\n                        token = None\n                    download_config = DownloadConfig(token=token)\n                    with xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n                        bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\n                    image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n\n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if available\n        if \"ImageOps\" in locals() and hasattr(ImageOps, \"exif_transpose\"):\n            try:\n                image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n            except Exception:\n                # If EXIF processing fails for any reason, fall back to the original image\n                pass\n\n        # Ensure underlying file is closed\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n\n        # Optional explicit mode conversion requested by the user\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # Post-processing hook (provided by the other feature);

No changes to the body of `decode_example` are needed from their side.\n- Dependency order:\n  - My changes can be merged independently; the hook call is guarded with `hasattr` to avoid AttributeError before the other agent\u2019s method is added.\n  - Once the other agent adds the `_postprocess_decoded_image` method, it will be invoked automatically during decoding.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature1\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:21:15.548862\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata can appear rotated/flipped when decoded with PIL, leading to inconsistent orientations and mismatched dimensions.\n- Goal: Automatically apply EXIF orientation correction during image decoding within the datasets.features.Image class.\n- Requirements:\n  - Integrate EXIF correction using ImageOps.exif_transpose during decoding.\n  - Keep default behavior otherwise unchanged.\n  - Coordinate with the other agent who will add a CMYK\u2192RGB post-processing hook method without causing merge conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Target file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- Target function: Image.decode_example\n- Approach:\n  - Import ImageOps inside decode_example when PIL is available.\n  - After opening the image, apply ImageOps.exif_transpose if available.\n  - Ensure we call image.load() on the final image object to avoid open file descriptor issues.\n  - Preserve existing user-requested mode conversion (self.mode) after EXIF correction.\n  - Call a post-processing hook if present: image = self._postprocess_decoded_image(image).
