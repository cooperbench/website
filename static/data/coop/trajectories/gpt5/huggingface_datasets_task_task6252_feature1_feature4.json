Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Returns the (possibly) transposed image.\n317     Falls back to the original image if EXIF data is missing or on any error.\n318     \"\"\"\n319     try:\n320         from PIL import ImageOps\n321         return ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n322     except Exception:\n323         return image\n324 \n325 \n326 def encode_np_array(array: np.ndarray) -> dict:\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the helper minimal and safe. Do not add top-level imports.\n- Use quoted type hints for consistency with the file.\n\n### Step 2: Apply EXIF orientation in decode_example before mode conversion\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Lines 189-191 (replace block after image.load())\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code (lines 185-191):\n```\n185                     image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n186         else:\n187             image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n190             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n191         return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n185                     image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n186         else:\n187             image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         # [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\n190         image = _apply_exif_orientation(image)\n191         # [MODE] Convert if requested\n192         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n193             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n194         return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve image.load() line as-is for file descriptor safety.\n- Add both comment markers exactly as shown for other agent coordination.\n- Maintain indentation and return behavior.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership:\n  - I own only the EXIF-related changes detailed above in src/datasets/features/image.py.\n  - Other agent owns crop_margin parameter addition, validation (via __post_init__), docstring updates, serialization/deserialization (natural via dataclass), and crop helper insertion.\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n  - My insertion points:\n    - Add helper at line 315.\n    - Replace lines 189-191 in decode_example.\n  - I added markers:\n    - # [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\n    - # [MODE] Convert if requested\n  - Other agent will:\n    - Insert their crop application right after line 190 (after calling _apply_exif_orientation) and before the # [MODE] marker.\n    - Add their helper after encode_np_array to avoid conflict with my helper placement.\n- Dependency order:\n  - My EXIF PR should be merged first.\n  - The other agent will rebase and add their crop changes anchored to the markers.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2025-10-22T03:06:23.378142", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:54242": 54242, "http://localhost:56479": 56479}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-10-22", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-10-22T03:06:56.555603", "source": "agent", "message": "Managing 7 task items.", "action": "task_tracking", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "task_tracker", "tool_call_id": "call_EdcU4lKGBmfoB7cs3JkXUUts", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-CTJT7jNYoSe0jXI30IJKYTK51M03i", "created": 1761102385, "model": "litellm_proxy/gpt-5-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"plan\",\"task_list\":[{\"id\":\"t1\",\"title\":\"Explore repository to locate src/datasets/features/image.py and understand current Image.decode_example implementation\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t2\",\"title\":\"Coordinate with other agent about planned edits with exact file path and line ranges before modifying\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t3\",\"title\":\"Implement helper _apply_exif_orientation in src/datasets/features/image.py at safe module scope\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t4\",\"title\":\"Apply EXIF orientation correction in decode_example after image.load() and before any mode conversion\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t5\",\"title\":\"Run quick static checks/grep and any available tests to ensure no breakage\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t6\",\"title\":\"Commit changes with appropriate message and co-author trailer\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t7\",\"title\":\"Send final status update to the other agent summarizing implemented changes and line ranges\",\"status\":\"todo\"}]}", "name": "task_tracker"}, "id": "call_EdcU4lKGBmfoB7cs3JkXUUts", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 988, "prompt_tokens": 7654, "total_tokens": 8642, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 768, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 7424, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.019447500000000003, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 7654, "completion_tokens": 988, "cache_read_tokens": 7424, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 272000, "per_turn_token": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "plan", "task_list": [{"id": "t1", "title": "Explore repository to locate src/datasets/features/image.py and understand current Image.decode_example implementation", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t2", "title": "Coordinate with other agent about planned edits with exact file path and line ranges before modifying", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t3", "title": "Implement helper _apply_exif_orientation in src/datasets/features/image.py at safe module scope", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t4", "title": "Apply EXIF orientation correction in decode_example after image.load() and before any mode conversion", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t5", "title": "Run quick static checks/grep and any available tests to ensure no breakage", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t6", "title": "Commit changes with appropriate message and co-author trailer", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t7", "title": "Send final status update to the other agent summarizing implemented changes and line ranges", "status": "todo"}], "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 6, "timestamp": "2025-10-22T03:06:56.569112", "source": "agent", "message": "Task list has been updated with 7 items.

Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "action": "system", "args": {"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature4\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:14:31.561350\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Some datasets have consistent border artifacts (e.g., watermarks) that should be removed automatically during image decoding.\n- Goal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to the Image feature that crops a uniform number of pixels from all four edges during decoding.\n- Requirements:\n  - New parameter crop_margin: Optional[int], validated to be >= 0 or None.\n  - Automatic cropping to be applied during decode, after EXIF orientation is handled and before mode conversion.\n  - Update docstring to document crop_margin.\n  - Ensure compatibility with existing serialization/deserialization (dataclass asdict + Features.from_dict behavior).\n  - Avoid merge conflicts with the other agent\u2019s EXIF feature in the same file, honoring their markers.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- The Image feature is a dataclass; adding a new field with a default preserves backward compatibility and is automatically handled by Features.to_dict/asdict serialization.\n- Cropping must occur after EXIF orientation is applied (so we crop the correctly oriented image), and before any mode conversion.\n- We\u2019ll add a private helper _apply_crop_margin to perform safe cropping with bounds clamping to ensure image dimensions remain at least 1x1.\n- Coordination markers from the EXIF feature will be used:\n  - \u201c# [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\u201d (present in decode_example)\n  - \u201c# [MODE] Convert if requested\u201d (present just above mode conversion)\n- No new top-level imports are required. TYPE_CHECKING already covers PIL.Image in type annotations.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Other agent ownership:\n  - Owns EXIF auto-orientation: adding helper _apply_exif_orientation and calling it in Image.decode_example.\n  - Will insert the marker comment \u201c# [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\u201d at the call site and \u201c# [MODE] Convert if requested\u201d above the mode conversion block.\n  - They will add their helper between encode_pil_image and encode_np_array. I will not modify that region.\n- My ownership:\n  - Owns adding crop_margin field to the Image dataclass and validation in __post_init__.\n  - Owns updating class docstring Args to include crop_margin.\n  - Owns adding _apply_crop_margin helper after encode_np_array.\n  - Owns inserting the crop call in decode_example immediately after the \u201c[EXIF]\u201d marker and before the \u201c[MODE]\u201d marker.\n- Dependency/order: The EXIF PR must land first. I will rebase and then apply my changes using the agreed markers to avoid line conflicts.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Update Image docstring to document crop_margin\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 63-69 (within the Image class docstring Args section)\nAction: Insert new argument description for crop_margin after the existing `decode` argument.\nBefore Code (excerpt around lines 62-69):\n\"\"\"\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n\"\"\"\nAfter Code:\n\"\"\"\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data.

Features.from_dict reconstructs dataclasses with matching keys; when absent, the default `None` applies. No edits required.\n\n### Step 6: Minimal smoke-test guidance (for reviewer)\n- Construct: `Image()` -> behavior unchanged.\n- Construct: `Image(crop_margin=10)` -> should include crop in repr (dataclass default) and apply cropping during decode.\n- Invalid: `Image(crop_margin=-1)` -> raises ValueError.\n- Invalid: `Image(crop_margin=1.5)` -> raises TypeError.\n\n### Step 7: Coordination/merge order\n- Wait for the EXIF PR to merge (adds markers and helper).\n- Rebase this branch to include those changes.\n- Apply Steps 1-4.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature4\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:14:31.561350\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Some datasets have consistent border artifacts (e.g., watermarks) that should be removed automatically during image decoding.\n- Goal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to the Image feature that crops a uniform number of pixels from all four edges during decoding.\n- Requirements:\n  - New parameter crop_margin: Optional[int], validated to be >= 0 or None.\n  - Automatic cropping to be applied during decode, after EXIF orientation is handled and before mode conversion.\n  - Update docstring to document crop_margin.\n  - Ensure compatibility with existing serialization/deserialization (dataclass asdict + Features.from_dict behavior).\n  - Avoid merge conflicts with the other agent\u2019s EXIF feature in the same file, honoring their markers.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- The Image feature is a dataclass; adding a new field with a default preserves backward compatibility and is automatically handled by Features.to_dict/asdict serialization.\n- Cropping must occur after EXIF orientation is applied (so we crop the correctly oriented image), and before any mode conversion.\n- We\u2019ll add a private helper _apply_crop_margin to perform safe cropping with bounds clamping to ensure image dimensions remain at least 1x1.\n- Coordination markers from the EXIF feature will be used:\n  - \u201c# [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\u201d (present in decode_example)\n  - \u201c# [MODE] Convert if requested\u201d (present just above mode conversion)\n- No new top-level imports are required.

Insert immediately on the next line.\nAction: Add new helper function.\nAfter Code:\n\ndef _apply_crop_margin(image: \"PIL.Image.Image\", margin: int) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n    \"\"\"Safely crop a uniform margin from all sides of the image.\n\n    Ensures at least 1 pixel remains along each dimension.\n    Returns the original image if margin is None, <= 0, or if an error occurs.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        if margin is None or margin <= 0:\n            return image\n        # Ensure integer margin\n        m = int(margin)\n        w, h = image.size\n        # Clamp to keep at least 1 pixel in width/height\n        max_m_w = max((w - 1) // 2, 0)\n        max_m_h = max((h - 1) // 2, 0)\n        m = min(m, max_m_w, max_m_h)\n        if m <= 0:\n            return image\n        return image.crop((m, m, w - m, h - m))\n    except Exception:\n        # Be conservative: on any unexpected error, return the original image\n        return image\n\nCritical Details: Place this after encode_np_array to avoid overlapping the other agent\u2019s EXIF helper region (which is between encode_pil_image and encode_np_array). Keep PIL type hints as string annotations to avoid import side-effects.\n\n### Step 4: Apply crop in decode_example after EXIF step and before mode conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: In `Image.decode_example`, immediately after the line containing the marker \u201c# [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\u201d and the subsequent call `image = _apply_exif_orientation(image)`, and before the line containing the marker \u201c# [MODE] Convert if requested\u201d.\nAction: Insert the crop application block.\nBefore Code (post-EXIF PR by other agent):\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\n        image = _apply_exif_orientation(image)\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\nAfter Code:\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # [EXIF] Orientation transpose applied\n        image = _apply_exif_orientation(image)\n        # [CROP] Crop margin applied\n        if self.crop_margin:\n            image = _apply_crop_margin(image, self.crop_margin)\n        # [MODE] Convert if requested\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\nCritical Details:\n- Do not modify or remove the EXIF call or markers.\n- Ensure the crop step runs before mode conversion.\n- The condition `if self.crop_margin:` treats `None` and `0` as no-ops; validation already ensures non-negative values.\n\n### Step 5: No changes needed for serialization/deserialization\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py` (no edits)\nExplanation: The Image feature is a dataclass and Features.to_dict uses asdict, so crop_margin will serialize automatically. Features.from_dict reconstructs dataclasses with matching keys; when absent, the default `None` applies. No edits required.\n\n### Step 6: Minimal smoke-test guidance (for reviewer)\n- Construct: `Image()` -> behavior unchanged.\n- Construct: `Image(crop_margin=10)` -> should include crop in repr (dataclass default) and apply cropping during decode.\n- Invalid: `Image(crop_margin=-1)` -> raises ValueError.\n- Invalid: `Image(crop_margin=1.5)` -> raises TypeError.\n\n### Step 7: Coordination/merge order\n- Wait for the EXIF PR to merge (adds markers and helper).\n- Rebase this branch to include those changes.\n- Apply Steps 1-4. Steps 5-6 are explanatory only.\n\n### Step 8: Ownership summary\n- I own: all changes in Steps 1-4 in src/datasets/features/image.py, excluding any modifications to EXIF helper or its call.\n- Other agent owns: EXIF helper definition and invocation with markers in decode_example.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

E.g. you could push changes with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\n```"}]}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 10, "timestamp": "2025-10-22T04:06:23.343544", "source": "agent", "message": "Managing 7 task items.", "action": "task_tracking", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "task_tracker", "tool_call_id": "call_WDJt3SxTluNuz7EqBnH4A6mS", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-CTKOtmCRu0pTpYTPRvLdkpGVfIcQN", "created": 1761105967, "model": "litellm_proxy/gpt-5-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"plan\",\"task_list\":[{\"id\":\"t1\",\"title\":\"Explore src/datasets/features/image.py to locate anchors and exact line numbers\",\"status\":\"in_progress\"},{\"id\":\"t2\",\"title\":\"Update Image class docstring to document crop_margin\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t3\",\"title\":\"Add crop_margin field to Image dataclass and __post_init__ validation\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t4\",\"title\":\"Add _apply_crop_margin helper after encode_np_array\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t5\",\"title\":\"Insert crop application in decode_example between EXIF and MODE anchors\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t6\",\"title\":\"Run static checks (import, lint-like sanity) and commit changes\",\"status\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"t7\",\"title\":\"Coordinate line ranges with other agent and send final status update\",\"status\":\"todo\"}]}", "name": "task_tracker"}, "id": "call_WDJt3SxTluNuz7EqBnH4A6mS", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 645, "prompt_tokens": 10338, "total_tokens": 10983, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 448, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 6144, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}, "prompt_index": 0}]}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.033612500000000003, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 18978, "completion_tokens": 989, "cache_read_tokens": 12288, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 272000, "per_turn_token": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "plan", "task_list": [{"id": "t1", "title": "Explore src/datasets/features/image.py to locate anchors and exact line numbers", "status": "in_progress"}, {"id": "t2", "title": "Update Image class docstring to document crop_margin", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t3", "title": "Add crop_margin field to Image dataclass and __post_init__ validation", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t4", "title": "Add _apply_crop_margin helper after encode_np_array", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t5", "title": "Insert crop application in decode_example between EXIF and MODE anchors", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t6", "title": "Run static checks (import, lint-like sanity) and commit changes", "status": "todo"}, {"id": "t7", "title": "Coordinate line ranges with other agent and send final status update", "status": "todo"}], "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 11, "timestamp": "2025-10-22T04:06:24.026639", "source": "agent", "message": "Task list has been updated with 7 items.

This is within the Image class.\n4) INSERT helper function `_apply_crop_margin(...)` after line 356 (module scope, ~20 lines).
