Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Each callable signature: (feature: FeatureType, metadata: Optional[dict]) -> Optional[bool]. It can return True/False to override, or None to defer to default behavior.\n- require_decoding signature extended to include metadata: Optional[dict] = None. It will consult the registry first (short-circuit on first non-None decision), then fallback to existing recursive logic.\n- keep_features_dicts_synced decorator will pass Features-level metadata to require_decoding via getattr(self, \"_require_decoding_metadata\", None).\n- Features gains two methods set_require_decoding_metadata and get_require_decoding_metadata after decode_batch, clearly separated by a comment. The setter recomputes _column_requires_decoding using the updated metadata.\n- Minimal import change: add Callable from typing.\n- Backward compatible: Existing calls to require_decoding remain valid; metadata defaults to None.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add Callable import\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 25 (modify import list)\nAction: Replace line 25 to include Callable\nBefore Code:\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nAfter Code:\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Callable\nCritical Details: Do not change other imports.

Short-circuit based on registry. Propagate metadata in recursive calls.\n\n### Step 4: Update keep_features_dicts_synced decorator to pass metadata\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Lines 1208\u20131278 (three specific spots)\nAction: Modify three require_decoding calls to pass metadata\nChanges:\n1) In _recompute (around line 1210)\nBefore Code:\nself._column_requires_decoding = {col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()}\nAfter Code:\nself._column_requires_decoding = {\n    col: require_decoding(feature, metadata=getattr(self, \"_require_decoding_metadata\", None))\n    for col, feature in self.items()\n}\n\n2) In __setitem__ wrapper (around line 1225)\nBefore Code:\nself._column_requires_decoding[key] = require_decoding(value)\nAfter Code:\nself._column_requires_decoding[key] = require_decoding(\n    value, metadata=getattr(self, \"_require_decoding_metadata\", None)\n)\n\n3) In setdefault wrapper (around line 1270)\nBefore Code:\nself._column_requires_decoding[key] = require_decoding(value)\nAfter Code:\nself._column_requires_decoding[key] = require_decoding(\n    value, metadata=getattr(self, \"_require_decoding_metadata\", None)\n)\nCritical Details: Do not alter the structure of the decorator; only pass metadata via getattr to remain safe if attribute not set. Leave other wrappers unchanged.\n\n### Step 5: Add Features metadata setter/getter after decode_batch\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Insert after line 1477 (immediately after the end of Features.decode_batch), before def copy\nAction: Add\nAfter Code:\n        # Decoding criteria extension \u2013 do not edit\n        def set_require_decoding_metadata(self, metadata: Optional[dict]) -> \"Features\":\n            \"\"\"Set optional metadata used by custom require_decoding criteria.\n\n            This also recomputes the internal mapping of columns requiring decoding.\n            Returns self to allow chaining.\n            \"\"\"\n            self._require_decoding_metadata = metadata\n            # Recompute mapping to reflect new metadata\n            self._column_requires_decoding = {\n                col: require_decoding(feature, metadata=metadata) for col, feature in self.items()\n            }\n            return self\n\n        def get_require_decoding_metadata(self) -> Optional[dict]:\n            \"\"\"Get the current metadata used by custom require_decoding criteria.\"\"\"\n            return getattr(self, \"_require_decoding_metadata\", None)\nCritical Details: Keep indentation aligned with other methods in the class. The comment clearly marks the extension block. Ensure these methods are inside the Features class, placed before def copy.\n\n### Step 6: No changes to other files and coordination boundaries\n- No other files are modified. All changes are confined to `src/datasets/features/features.py`.\n- Coordination notes (ownership confirmed with the other agent):\n  - I own the require_decoding function (lines 1181\u20131199 originally) and the new registry block inserted just above it (line ~1180), plus the related metadata setter/getter added after decode_batch, and the small parameter passing changes in keep_features_dicts_synced (lines ~1208\u20131278).\n  - The other agent owns Features.update and their two helpers, which they will insert inside the Features class right after __reduce__ (around lines 1320\u20131330). They will not touch the decorator or require_decoding regions.\n  - The other agent will not add imports; I only add Callable to the typing import line.\n\nEnvironment/Config: No environment variables or configuration changes required.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

The enhancement allows for more flexible control over the decoding process, enabling users to define their own conditions for whether a feature requires decoding.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `require_decoding` function only uses predefined rules to determine whether a feature requires decoding, limiting customization for complex datasets.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new extension to `require_decoding` allows users to define custom decoding conditions, using metadata or specific feature properties. This is implemented without disrupting the existing functionality of the `Features` class.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task3997_feature2\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T10:51:00.449057\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: The existing require_decoding function uses fixed rules, limiting customization for complex datasets.\n- Goal: Extend require_decoding to support custom decoding criteria based on metadata or feature-specific logic, while keeping backward compatibility and maintaining alignment with the Features class.\n- Requirements:\n  - Add a registry for custom criteria callables to influence decoding decisions.\n  - Allow passing metadata to require_decoding to evaluate custom criteria.\n  - Expose Features methods to set/get metadata and ensure the internal _column_requires_decoding mapping is recomputed when metadata changes.\n  - Update keep_features_dicts_synced decorator to pass metadata into require_decoding consistently when columns are modified.\n  - Avoid conflicts with the other agent\u2019s work on Features.update and their helpers.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- New global registry: _REQUIRE_DECODING_CRITERIA (list of callables). Each callable signature: (feature: FeatureType, metadata: Optional[dict]) -> Optional[bool]. It can return True/False to override, or None to defer to default behavior.\n- require_decoding signature extended to include metadata: Optional[dict] = None. It will consult the registry first (short-circuit on first non-None decision), then fallback to existing recursive logic.\n- keep_features_dicts_synced decorator will pass Features-level metadata to require_decoding via getattr(self, \"_require_decoding_metadata\", None).\n- Features gains two methods set_require_decoding_metadata and get_require_decoding_metadata after decode_batch, clearly separated by a comment.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

It also doesn\u2019t normalize JSON specs into FeatureType instances.\n- Goal: Extend Features.update to:\n  - Accept mappings or iterable of (key, value) pairs (preserve dict API)\n  - Accept batch updates: list/tuple of mappings or list/tuple of (key, value) pairs\n  - Normalize JSON-like dict/list feature specs (with \u201c_type\u201d) into FeatureType instances using generate_from_dict\n  - Leave other class logic and the keep_features_dicts_synced decorator intact so recomputation of _column_requires_decoding remains handled by the decorator\n- Constraints/Coordination:\n  - Only modify src/datasets/features/features.py\n  - Do not touch require_decoding (lines 1181\u20131199) or keep_features_dicts_synced decorator (1203\u20131280)\n  - Do not add imports at top; use existing in-scope symbols\n  - Insert changes within Features class right after __reduce__\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- The keep_features_dicts_synced class decorator wraps Features.update at class-definition time. Our override must exist in the class body so the decorator wraps our implementation (orig_update), and then recomputes _column_requires_decoding after our update runs.\n- Normalization strategy:\n  - Values already being FeatureType instances (Value, ClassLabel, Sequence, Array2D/3D/4D/5D, Audio, Image, Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages) are passed through untouched\n  - Dicts with key \u201c_type\u201d get deep-copied and converted via generate_from_dict (which mutates the dict by popping \u201c_type\u201d)\n  - Dicts without \u201c_type\u201d are treated as nested feature mappings; their values are normalized recursively\n  - Lists/Tuples are normalized element-wise and tuples are converted to lists for consistency\n  - Any other type raises TypeError (consistent with strict feature schema expectations)\n- Batch updates:\n  - iterable can be a mapping (has items()), an iterable of pairs, or a list/tuple of mappings or pairs; keywords are merged as last-in-wins\n  - Implementation applies using dict.__setitem__ to set each normalized key/value; the decorator will recompute the requires-decoding map afterwards\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add extended update and helpers inside Features\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1323 (immediately after `def __reduce__` and before `@property def type`)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n1320     def __reduce__(self):\n1321         return Features, (dict(self),)\n1322 \n1323     @property\n1324     def type(self):\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n1320     def __reduce__(self):\n1321         return Features, (dict(self),)\n1322 \n1323     def update(self, iterable=None, **kwds):\n1324         \"\"\"\n1325         Extended update supporting:\n1326           - Standard dict.update semantics: mapping or iterable of (key, value) pairs plus kwargs\n1327           - Batch updates: list/tuple of mappings or list/tuple of (key, value) pairs\n1328           - JSON-like feature specs normalization (dict/list containing \"_type\") into FeatureType instances\n1329 \n1330         Note:\n1331           - Value normalization converts JSON-like specs using generate_from_dict;

my update implementation is independent. The decorator will wrap my update regardless of Agent 1\u2019s changes (they only pass metadata into require_decoding)\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

The enhanced method improves flexibility when working with diverse data types, though it may conflict with the existing decorator-enhanced update method.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `update` method in `Features` only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe method is modified to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates. Careful attention was given to ensure compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method, though there is potential for conflict.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task3997_feature4\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T10:51:00.449492\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Features.update currently mirrors dict.update and doesn\u2019t support JSON-like feature specs or batch updates (list of mappings/pairs). It also doesn\u2019t normalize JSON specs into FeatureType instances.\n- Goal: Extend Features.update to:\n  - Accept mappings or iterable of (key, value) pairs (preserve dict API)\n  - Accept batch updates: list/tuple of mappings or list/tuple of (key, value) pairs\n  - Normalize JSON-like dict/list feature specs (with \u201c_type\u201d) into FeatureType instances using generate_from_dict\n  - Leave other class logic and the keep_features_dicts_synced decorator intact so recomputation of _column_requires_decoding remains handled by the decorator\n- Constraints/Coordination:\n  - Only modify src/datasets/features/features.py\n  - Do not touch require_decoding (lines 1181\u20131199) or keep_features_dicts_synced decorator (1203\u20131280)\n  - Do not add imports at top; use existing in-scope symbols\n  - Insert changes within Features class right after __reduce__\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- The keep_features_dicts_synced class decorator wraps Features.update at class-definition time. Our override must exist in the class body so the decorator wraps our implementation (orig_update), and then recomputes _column_requires_decoding after our update runs.\n- Normalization strategy:\n  - Values already being FeatureType instances (Value, ClassLabel, Sequence, Array2D/3D/4D/5D, Audio, Image, Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages) are passed through untouched\n  - Dicts with key \u201c_type\u201d get deep-copied and converted via generate_from_dict (which mutates the dict by popping \u201c_type\u201d)\n  - Dicts without \u201c_type\u201d are treated as nested feature mappings; their values are normalized recursively\n  - Lists/Tuples are normalized element-wise and tuples are converted to lists for consistency\n  - Any other type raises TypeError (consistent with strict feature schema expectations)\n- Batch updates:\n  - iterable can be a mapping (has items()), an iterable of pairs, or a list/tuple of mappings or pairs; keywords are merged as last-in-wins\n  - Implementation applies using dict.__setitem__ to set each normalized key/value; the decorator will recompute the requires-decoding map afterwards\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add extended update and helpers inside Features\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1323 (immediately after `def __reduce__` and before `@property def type`)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n1320     def __reduce__(self):\n1321         return Features, (dict(self),)\n1322 \n1323     @property\n1324     def type(self):\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n1320     def __reduce__(self):\n1321         return Features, (dict(self),)\n1322 \n1323     def update(self, iterable=None, **kwds):\n1324         \"\"\"\n1325         Extended update supporting:\n1326           - Standard dict.update semantics: mapping or iterable of (key, value) pairs plus kwargs\n1327           - Batch updates: list/tuple of mappings or list/tuple of (key, value) pairs\n1328           - JSON-like feature specs normalization (dict/list containing \"_type\") into FeatureType instances\n1329 \n1330         Note:\n1331           - Value normalization converts JSON-like specs using generate_from_dict;

If you need me to adjust any boundaries or forward metadata elsewhere, let me know.\n\nFinal coordination message to agent_4\n- Implemented:\n  - require_decoding updated at 1202\u20131242 to accept metadata and consult the registry\n  - __init__ and __setitem__ updated at 1280\u20131283 and 1286\u20131289 to pass metadata\n  - Added set_require_decoding_metadata and get_require_decoding_metadata at 1464\u20131480\n- Confirmed: I did not edit within your update ranges (1252\u20131361) nor the removed old update (1248\u20131256).
