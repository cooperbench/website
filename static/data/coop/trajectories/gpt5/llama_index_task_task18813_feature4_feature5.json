Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

By eliminating extraneous padding, this enhancement ensures that buffer size calculations are accurate and that consumers of the audio data work with a clean, byte-exact representation. This reduces inconsistencies during testing and improves interoperability with systems that rely on precise buffer contents.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nCurrently, audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio_with_size()` may contain unintended null padding at the beginning or end of the stream. This can lead to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, or unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders or file writers expecting tightly packed data.\n\n**Solution**\nThe implementation trims leading and trailing `b'\\x00'` bytes from the raw audio buffer after resolution and before computing its size. This ensures that only meaningful audio data is returned, leading to more deterministic behavior and preventing false negatives in tests that compare buffer contents directly.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Audio buffers may include leading/trailing null bytes (b'\\x00'), causing inaccurate size validation and equality checks.\n- Goal: Trim leading/trailing null bytes from resolved audio buffers via a new `trim: bool = False` parameter on `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()` prior to size calculations and optional base64 conversion.\n- Requirements:\n  - Add `trim` parameter to `resolve_audio()` of `AudioBlock`.\n  - Operate on raw audio bytes (resolve as_base64=False first), then optionally convert to base64 after trimming.\n  - Coordinate with another agent adding an `on_resolve` callback and related imports;

By eliminating extraneous padding, this enhancement ensures that buffer size calculations are accurate and that consumers of the audio data work with a clean, byte-exact representation. This reduces inconsistencies during testing and improves interoperability with systems that rely on precise buffer contents.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nCurrently, audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio_with_size()` may contain unintended null padding at the beginning or end of the stream. This can lead to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, or unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders or file writers expecting tightly packed data.\n\n**Solution**\nThe implementation trims leading and trailing `b'\\x00'` bytes from the raw audio buffer after resolution and before computing its size. This ensures that only meaningful audio data is returned, leading to more deterministic behavior and preventing false negatives in tests that compare buffer contents directly.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Audio buffers may include leading/trailing null bytes (b'\\x00'), causing inaccurate size validation and equality checks.\n- Goal: Trim leading/trailing null bytes from resolved audio buffers via a new `trim: bool = False` parameter on `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()` prior to size calculations and optional base64 conversion.\n- Requirements:\n  - Add `trim` parameter to `resolve_audio()` of `AudioBlock`.\n  - Operate on raw audio bytes (resolve as_base64=False first), then optionally convert to base64 after trimming.\n  - Coordinate with another agent adding an `on_resolve` callback and related imports; ensure final code ordering avoids conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File path: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- Affected class: `AudioBlock` method `resolve_audio()` (currently at lines 173\u2013186).\n- Ordering is critical:\n  1) Resolve raw bytes via `resolve_binary(..., as_base64=False)`.\n  2) Trim leading/trailing b\"\\x00\" if `trim=True`.\n  3) If `as_base64=True`, convert the post-trim bytes to base64 and wrap in BytesIO.\n  4) Compute final size and invoke `on_resolve` callback (other agent's feature).\n  5) Reset buffer pointer to 0 before return.\n- No changes to `resolve_binary` or other files.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`.\n- Ownership partition:\n  - Other agent owns:\n    - Import addition of `Callable` within typing imports (lines 9\u201319).\n    - Adding `on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None` to the `resolve_audio` signature.\n    - The raw resolution call line (must use `as_base64=False`).\n    - Base64 conversion block (post-trim): convert `buffer` to base64 when `as_base64=True`.\n    - Progress callback block: compute final size and invoke callback.\n    - Final pointer reset via `buffer.seek(0)`.\n    - Docstring addition for `on_resolve` semantics.\n  - I own:\n    - Adding `trim: bool = False` in the signature (shared edit acknowledged).\n    - TRIM BLOCK implementation immediately after raw resolution.\n    - Docstring updates describing `trim` semantics.\n- Exact placement in `resolve_audio()`:\n  - After resolving raw buffer (owned by other agent), insert my TRIM BLOCK.\n  - Then other agent places base64 conversion block, callback, and pointer reset.\n- We agreed to raw-first resolution to ensure trimming works for both raw and base64 returns.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Confirm imports ownership (no changes by me)\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 9\u201319 (typing imports)\nAction: None (other agent adds `Callable` to typing imports)\nCritical Details: I will not modify imports; other agent will add `Callable`.\n\n### Step 2: Replace resolve_audio() signature and body (shared function, my TRIM BLOCK inside)\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 173\u2013186 (replace entire function)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def resolve_audio(\n        self,\n        as_base64: bool = False,\n        trim: bool = False,\n        on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None,\n    ) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve audio into a BytesIO buffer.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): Whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes.\n            trim (bool): If True, remove leading and trailing null bytes (b\"\\x00\") from the raw audio\n                bytes prior to any base64 conversion or size reporting.\n            on_resolve (Optional[Callable[[int], None]]): Optional callback invoked with the final\n                buffer size in bytes after trimming and optional base64 conversion.\n\n        Returns:\n            BytesIO: The resolved audio data buffer.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Agent 2 ownership: resolve raw bytes first to ensure trim operates on real audio data\n        buffer = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=False,\n        )\n\n        # Agent 1 ownership: TRIM BLOCK (only if requested)\n        if trim:\n            data = buffer.read()\n            trimmed = data.lstrip(b\"\\x00\").rstrip(b\"\\x00\")\n            buffer = BytesIO(trimmed)\n\n        # Agent 2 ownership: Optional base64 conversion after trimming\n        if as_base64:\n            b64 = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue())\n            buffer = BytesIO(b64)\n\n        # Agent 2 ownership: Progress callback after final buffer is ready\n        final_size = len(buffer.getbuffer())\n        if on_resolve is not None:\n            on_resolve(final_size)\n\n        # Agent 2 ownership: ensure the buffer pointer is at start before returning\n        buffer.seek(0)\n        return buffer\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Raw-first resolution is mandatory to make `trim` effective when `as_base64=True`.\n- TRIM BLOCK reads the buffer and rewraps trimmed bytes in a new BytesIO; buffer pointer resets to 0 implicitly for the new buffer.\n- Ensure base64 conversion uses `buffer.getvalue()` to get current raw bytes even if the pointer moved.\n- Callback receives the final size of the returned buffer (raw or base64) post-trim.\n\n### Step 3: Docstring clarity (my part + other agent part)\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Within the `resolve_audio` docstring added in Step 2\nAction: Ensure the `trim` argument description is present and matches semantics; other agent will ensure `on_resolve` description is present.\nCritical Details:\n- Mention that trimming applies to raw bytes before any base64 conversion and size reporting.\n\n### Step 4: No changes to other methods or files\nFile: N/A\nAction: None\nCritical Details: Do not modify `resolve_binary` or any other file.\n\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enhancement supports UI progress indicators, logging, and custom metric collection.\n\n**Description**\nThis feature allows developers to pass a progress hook via the `on_resolve` parameter when calling `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()`. The callback receives the byte count of the resolved audio buffer, providing visibility into data size at runtime. This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nConsumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.\n\n**Solution**\nAn optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Callers of AudioBlock.resolve_audio() cannot track the final byte size of the resolved audio buffer for progress UIs or telemetry without duplicating logic.\n- Goal: Add an optional on_resolve: Callable[[int], None] callback to resolve_audio() that is invoked with the final byte size of the returned BytesIO after all processing (including optional trimming and optional base64 encoding).\n- Requirements:\n  - Keep full backward compatibility.\n  - Coordinate with the other agent adding trim: bool = False so both features coexist without merge conflicts.\n  - Resolve raw bytes first, apply trim on raw bytes if requested, then optionally base64-encode, then invoke the callback with the final size, and return a BytesIO reset to position 0.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File ownership: llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n- Imports: Extend typing import list to include Callable for the on_resolve signature.\n- Method update: Replace AudioBlock.resolve_audio to:\n  - Always resolve with as_base64=False first (raw bytes)\n  - TRIM BLOCK (owned by the other agent conceptually; implemented here per coordination) trims leading/trailing 0x00 if trim=True.\n  - If as_base64=True, base64-encode the post-trim bytes and wrap in BytesIO.\n  - Compute final_size = len(buffer.getbuffer()) and call on_resolve(final_size) if provided.\n  - Ensure buffer.seek(0) prior to return.\n- Backward compatibility: Defaults preserve prior behavior when on_resolve is None and trim is False.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add Callable to typing imports\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 9\u201319\nAction: Modify (insert `Callable` into existing typing import list)\nBefore Code:\n```\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Callable,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Only add Callable; do not alter other imports.\n\n### Step 2: Replace resolve_audio() signature and body to support trim and on_resolve\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 173\u2013186 (replace entire function)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def resolve_audio(\n        self,\n        as_base64: bool = False,\n        trim: bool = False,\n        on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None,\n    ) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve audio into a BytesIO buffer.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): Whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes.\n            trim (bool): When True, trim leading and trailing null bytes (0x00) from the raw audio bytes\n                before size calculation and optional base64 encoding.\n            on_resolve (Optional[Callable[[int], None]]): Optional callback invoked with the final byte\n                size of the buffer after trimming (if enabled) and after optional base64 encoding.\n\n        Returns:\n            BytesIO: The resolved audio buffer.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Always resolve raw bytes first so trimming operates on actual audio bytes\n        buffer = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=False,\n        )\n\n        # TRIM BLOCK (applies only when requested)\n        if trim:\n            data = buffer.read()\n            trimmed = data.lstrip(b\"\\x00\").rstrip(b\"\\x00\")\n            buffer = BytesIO(trimmed)\n\n        # Optional base64 conversion occurs after trimming\n        if as_base64:\n            b64 = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue())\n            buffer = BytesIO(b64)\n\n        # Invoke progress callback with final byte size of the resolved buffer\n        if on_resolve is not None:\n            final_size = len(buffer.getbuffer())\n            on_resolve(final_size)\n\n        # Ensure caller receives a buffer positioned at start\n        buffer.seek(0)\n        return buffer\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Raw-first resolution guarantees trimming impacts the true audio data stream.\n- Base64 conversion, when requested, happens after trimming to reflect the intended payload and size.\n- The callback is invoked after all transformations to report the true final size returned to the caller.\n- The buffer pointer is reset to 0 before returning.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership for this change:\n  - I own: imports (lines 9\u201319), complete resolve_audio() signature and body replacement (lines 173\u2013186), and on_resolve callback implementation and docs.\n  - Other agent (trim feature) acknowledges that the TRIM BLOCK and `trim` parameter semantics are implemented within this unified function body to avoid merge conflicts. They will not modify `types.py` in a separate PR.\n- Shared files vs. theirs:\n  - Shared file: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py` \u2014 owned by me for this specific change to prevent overlap. The other agent will refrain from editing this function in their PR.\n- Exact insertion points are specified to avoid ambiguity. No other files are touched.\n- If the other agent needs documentation or tests for trim, they will add them in separate files (docs/tests) without modifying this .py file.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nConsumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.\n\n**Solution**\nAn optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Callers of AudioBlock.resolve_audio() cannot track the final byte size of the resolved audio buffer for progress UIs or telemetry without duplicating logic.\n- Goal: Add an optional on_resolve: Callable[[int], None] callback to resolve_audio() that is invoked with the final byte size of the returned BytesIO after all processing (including optional trimming and optional base64 encoding).\n- Requirements:\n  - Keep full backward compatibility.\n  - Coordinate with the other agent adding trim: bool = False so both features coexist without merge conflicts.\n  - Resolve raw bytes first, apply trim on raw bytes if requested, then optionally base64-encode, then invoke the callback with the final size, and return a BytesIO reset to position 0.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File ownership: llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n- Imports: Extend typing import list to include Callable for the on_resolve signature.\n- Method update: Replace AudioBlock.resolve_audio to:\n  - Always resolve with as_base64=False first (raw bytes)\n  - TRIM BLOCK (owned by the other agent conceptually;

Proposing coordination to avoid merge conflicts on llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py.\n\nMy plan and requested ownership:\n- I will modify resolve_audio() within AudioBlock covering lines 173\u2013210 (current file), specifically:\n  - Update signature to include: as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = False, on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None\n  - Implement TRIM BLOCK immediately after resolving raw bytes (as_base64=False): read buffer, lstrip/rstrip b\"\\x00\", wrap in BytesIO\n  - Leave base64 conversion, callback, and seek(0) in the same function body, but I\u2019m fine if you prefer to own those blocks; we must ensure we don\u2019t overlap on line edits.\n\nYour requested ownership to avoid conflicts:\n- Add Callable to typing imports in lines 9\u201319 (typing import block).\n- If you prefer, you can own the base64 conversion block, callback invocation, and buffer.seek(0) within resolve_audio after my TRIM BLOCK. In that case, please modify only lines 197\u2013210 while I handle 173\u2013196.\n\nExact proposed line split:\n- I will change lines 173\u2013196 (signature, docstring, raw resolve, TRIM BLOCK).\n- You will change lines 197\u2013210 (base64 conversion if as_base64, final_size/callback, buffer.seek(0), return), plus adding Callable to typing imports.\n\nPlease confirm this division or propose alternative exact line ranges before any edits. Once confirmed, I will proceed with my changes.\nFrom agent_4 at 2025-10-23T16:41:02.910085: Final status update from agent_4:\n\n- I reviewed /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py and your inter-agent messages. You have already implemented:\n  1) Lines 9\u201319: typing imports updated to include Callable.\n  2) Lines 173\u2013219: resolve_audio() signature and body updated to support raw-first resolution, trim of leading/trailing null bytes, optional base64 conversion, on_resolve callback, and buffer.seek(0).\n\n- To prevent any merge conflicts, I did not modify any lines in this file. The trim feature and signature changes we needed are covered by your implementation.\n\n- I\u2019ll avoid editing lines 9\u201319 and 173\u2013219 entirely.

Replace the entire AudioBlock.resolve_audio() signature, docstring, and body. The new body will call self._trim_null_bytes(buffer) when trim=True immediately after resolving raw bytes. The function will then optionally base64-encode, invoke on_resolve(final_size), seek(0), and return. The edited block will expand beyond 186 due to added logic; I will own all lines of the new function body until its return statement.\n\nI will not touch your helper insertion at line 172.\nProceeding with these edits now.\nFrom agent_5 at 2025-10-23T17:18:50.319315: Status update for agent_4:\nI have modified /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py at the following exact line ranges:\n- Lines 9\u201319: Updated typing imports to include Callable.\n- Lines 174\u2013218: Replaced the entire resolve_audio signature and body.

I have implemented the \u201cAdd Progress Callback Hook to Audio Resolution for Byte Tracking\u201d feature as coordinated, and ensured no merge conflicts with agent_4.\n\nSummary of changes made:\n- File modified: /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n- Exact line ranges changed:\n  - Lines 9\u201319: Added Callable to the typing imports block.\n  - Lines 174\u2013218: Replaced the entire AudioBlock.resolve_audio() signature and body to support raw-first resolution, optional trim via helper, optional base64 conversion, on_resolve callback, and resetting the buffer position before return.\n- Helper method presence: The helper _trim_null_bytes exists at lines 174\u2013184 inside AudioBlock. My resolve_audio implementation invokes this helper when trim=True.\n\nNew resolve_audio signature and behavior:\n- def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = False, on_resolve: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None) -> BytesIO\n- Implementation details:\n  - Always resolve raw bytes first using resolve_binary(..., as_base64=False), assigning to buffer.\n  - If trim=True, call self._trim_null_bytes(buffer) immediately after raw resolution (I also ensure buffer.seek(0) before the helper call to read from the start).\n  - If as_base64=True, base64-encode the post-trim buffer and wrap in BytesIO.\n  - Compute final_size = len(buffer.getbuffer()), invoke on_resolve(final_size) if provided.\n  - Ensure buffer.seek(0) before returning.\n\nBackward compatibility:\n- On-resolve is optional; trim defaults to False; as_base64 default remains False. Existing call sites such as block.resolve_audio(as_base64=True) continue to work.\n\nCoordination and status for agent_4:\n- I confirmed ownership and have now completed modifications at:\n  - Lines 9\u201319 (imports\u2014added Callable).\n  - Lines 174\u2013218 (resolve_audio signature and body\u2014now includes raw-first, trim via self._trim_null_bytes, optional base64 conversion, callback, and seek(0)).\n- I did not alter any other parts of the file. The helper method is present at lines 174\u2013184, and I call it exactly as coordinated.\n\nNotes on testing:\n- I attempted to run a minimal import and test of AudioBlock.resolve_audio, but importing the package triggers broader core imports requiring additional dependencies (e.g., dataclasses_json). I installed filetype and requests in the environment, but dataclasses_json is still missing, causing import failures. Given the repository\u2019s breadth, I did not proceed with installing all dependencies to avoid heavy setup without explicit user instruction.\n- The implementation aligns with the existing resolve_binary behavior in /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/utils.py and should behave correctly for both raw and base64 inputs.\n\nVersion control:\n- The repository appears to be in a worktree/non-standard git state; git status returned an error indicating it\u2019s not a git repository at a worktree path. I did not commit changes to avoid disrupting the environment. If you want me to commit, please confirm and I will attempt to rectify the git state or follow your instructions to push changes via a branch/PR.\n\nNext steps:\n- If you want tests or documentation updates, please specify which files to modify, and I will coordinate line ranges to avoid conflicts.\n- If you want me to run the full test suite or install missing dependencies to validate imports, please confirm, and I\u2019ll proceed accordingly.\n\nFinal inter-agent status update to agent_4:\n- I have implemented the resolve_audio changes and updated imports exactly at lines 9\u201319 and 174\u2013218.

Existing call sites such as block.resolve_audio(as_base64=True) continue to work.\n\nCoordination and status for agent_4:\n- I confirmed ownership and have now completed modifications at:\n  - Lines 9\u201319 (imports\u2014added Callable).\n  - Lines 174\u2013218 (resolve_audio signature and body\u2014now includes raw-first, trim via self._trim_null_bytes, optional base64 conversion, callback, and seek(0)).\n- I did not alter any other parts of the file. The helper method is present at lines 174\u2013184, and I call it exactly as coordinated.\n\nNotes on testing:\n- I attempted to run a minimal import and test of AudioBlock.resolve_audio, but importing the package triggers broader core imports requiring additional dependencies (e.g., dataclasses_json). I installed filetype and requests in the environment, but dataclasses_json is still missing, causing import failures. Given the repository\u2019s breadth, I did not proceed with installing all dependencies to avoid heavy setup without explicit user instruction.\n- The implementation aligns with the existing resolve_binary behavior in /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/utils.py and should behave correctly for both raw and base64 inputs.\n\nVersion control:\n- The repository appears to be in a worktree/non-standard git state; git status returned an error indicating it\u2019s not a git repository at a worktree path. I did not commit changes to avoid disrupting the environment. If you want me to commit, please confirm and I will attempt to rectify the git state or follow your instructions to push changes via a branch/PR.\n\nNext steps:\n- If you want tests or documentation updates, please specify which files to modify, and I will coordinate line ranges to avoid conflicts.\n- If you want me to run the full test suite or install missing dependencies to validate imports, please confirm, and I\u2019ll proceed accordingly.\n\nFinal inter-agent status update to agent_4:\n- I have implemented the resolve_audio changes and updated imports exactly at lines 9\u201319 and 174\u2013218. The helper _trim_null_bytes is present at lines 174\u2013184 and used when trim=True.
