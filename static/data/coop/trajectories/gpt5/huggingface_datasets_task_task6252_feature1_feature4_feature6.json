Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding.

Users currently need to post-process crops manually after decoding.\nGoal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to the Image feature to crop a uniform number of pixels from each edge during decoding.\nRequirements:\n- New dataclass field: crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n- Document crop_margin in Image class docstring under Args\n- Perform cropping in decode_example only if crop_margin is a positive integer\n- Cropping happens after EXIF-transpose (Agent 1), after image.load(), after CMYK->RGB fix (Agent 3), and after optional user-specified mode conversion, then return\n- Do not modify other behaviors or files\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership:\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- I own: crop_margin field, docstring update, crop logic insertion at the end of decode_example\n- Agent 1 owns: EXIF orientation correction insertions immediately after each PIL.Image.open(...)\n- Agent 3 owns: CMYK->RGB conversion immediately after image.load()\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: EXIF orientation correction at open sites only\n- Agent 3: CMYK->RGB conversion after image.load() and before mode conversion\nShared File Strategy:\n- I will not touch the PIL.Image.open(...) call sites or the image.load() line\n- My crop block will be inserted after the existing user mode conversion block and before return image\n- Docstring and dataclass field additions are disjoint from Agents 1 and 3\u2019s changes\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature is a dataclass representing image decoding/encoding. We add a new optional field to control cropping and apply it in decode_example after all earlier normalization steps.\nCritical Notes:\n- Maintain import style (no new imports are required for cropping)\n- Ensure cropping clamps margin so it never exceeds half of width/height to avoid invalid boxes\n- Keep existing comments and structure intact; only insertions where specified\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Update Image class docstring to document crop_margin\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 62-68 (within Image class docstring under Args)\nOwnership: Shared file - I own this docstring edit\nAction: Modify (insert an additional Args entry)\nBefore Code:\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

We add a new optional field to control cropping and apply it in decode_example after all earlier normalization steps.\nCritical Notes:\n- Maintain import style (no new imports are required for cropping)\n- Ensure cropping clamps margin so it never exceeds half of width/height to avoid invalid boxes\n- Keep existing comments and structure intact; only insertions where specified\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Update Image class docstring to document crop_margin\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 62-68 (within Image class docstring under Args)\nOwnership: Shared file - I own this docstring edit\nAction: Modify (insert an additional Args entry)\nBefore Code:\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\nAfter Code:\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_margin (`int`, *optional*):\n            If provided and > 0, crops a uniform number of pixels from all four sides of the decoded image.\n            Cropping is applied after EXIF orientation correction, loading, and any automatic CMYK->RGB fix,\n            and after the optional user-specified mode conversion.\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve indentation and backticks; keep the Args order logical (place crop_margin after decode)\n\n### Step 2: Add `crop_margin` dataclass field to Image\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around lines 84-91 (Image dataclass field declarations)\nOwnership: Shared file - I own this field addition\nAction: Insert a new field\nBefore Code:\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\nAfter Code:\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the new field before the ClassVar attributes and after existing init fields\n- No additional imports required; typing.Optional is already imported\n\n### Step 3: Insert crop logic in decode_example after mode conversion and before return\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: After the existing mode conversion block in decode_example (after line 190), before `return image` (line 191)\nOwnership: Shared file - I own this insertion block\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\nAfter Code:\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # Optional border crop if crop_margin is set (> 0)\n        if getattr(self, \"crop_margin\", None) is not None:\n            try:\n                m = int(self.crop_margin)  # type: ignore[arg-type]\n            except Exception:\n                m = None\n            if m is not None and m > 0:\n                w, h = image.size\n                # ensure the crop margin does not exceed half the dimensions\n                m = min(m, w // 2, h // 2)\n                if m > 0:\n                    image = image.crop((m, m, w - m, h - m))\n\n        return image\nCritical Details:\n- Do not modify the `image.load()` line or the mode conversion conditional (reserved anchors for Agent 1 and 3 ordering)\n- The crop occurs strictly after potential EXIF transpose (Agent 1), after `image.load()`, after CMYK->RGB fix (Agent 3 insertion sits between load and mode conversion), and after mode conversion\n- Keep exact indentation (8 spaces inside method body)\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Some datasets contain consistent edge artifacts (e.g., watermarks/borders).

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Automatic EXIF Orientation Correction for Images\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis feature introduces automatic correction for images with EXIF orientation metadata by applying a transpose operation during image decoding. This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation tags load with incorrect orientation when decoded via PIL, causing rotated/flipped visuals and mismatched dimensions.\nGoal: Automatically correct EXIF orientation during image decoding in datasets.features.Image so returned PIL images are correctly oriented without extra user preprocessing.\nRequirements: Apply EXIF transpose immediately after opening the image and before any load/convert/crop steps. Avoid modifying other logic and keep compatibility with environments where EXIF or ImageOps may not be available.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py. I will only modify the three PIL.Image.open(...) call sites within Image.decode_example() to insert EXIF transpose blocks.\nOther Agent Handles: \n- Agent 2: Add crop_margin field and docs; add crop logic after mode conversion and before return.\n- Agent 3: Add CMYK\u2192RGB conversion immediately after image.load() and before the mode conversion.\nShared File Strategy: \n- My insertions occur strictly after each image open and before image.load().\n- I will not touch dataclass fields, docstrings, image.load(), user-specified mode conversion, or the new crop block.\n- Content-based anchors are provided to prevent conflicts if line numbers shift.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: datasets.features.Image.decode_example opens images from path or bytes. We will insert a try/except block calling PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose(image) right after image is opened in each code path (local path open, remote bytes open, and direct bytes open). This ensures orientation is corrected early.\nCritical Notes: \n- Keep insertion before image.load().\n- Use from PIL import ImageOps inside a try/except to avoid hard dependency changes and handle Pillow versions without EXIF or ImageOps gracefully.\n- Do not add top-level imports.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Insert EXIF transpose after opening local-path images\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 169 (inside Image.decode_example, in the branch `if is_local_path(path):`), immediately after `image = PIL.Image.open(path)`\nOwnership: Shared file - I handle only this insertion point\nAction: Modify (insert lines after the assignment)\nBefore Code:\n```\nif is_local_path(path):\n    image = PIL.Image.open(path)\nelse:\n    source_url = path.split(\"::\")[-1]\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\nif is_local_path(path):\n    image = PIL.Image.open(path)\n    try:\n        from PIL import ImageOps\n        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n    except Exception:\n        pass\nelse:\n    source_url = path.split(\"::\")[-1]\n```\nCritical Details: Maintain existing indentation. Do not move or alter surrounding logic.\n\n### Step 2: Insert EXIF transpose after opening remote-bytes images\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 185 (inside Image.decode_example, after bytes_ is read from xopen and `image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)`)\nOwnership: Shared file - I handle only this insertion point\nAction: Modify (insert lines after the assignment)\nBefore Code:\n```\nwith xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n    bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\nimage = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\nwith xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n    bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\nimage = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\ntry:\n    from PIL import ImageOps\n    image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\nexcept Exception:\n    pass\n```\nCritical Details: Keep comments and structure intact. Do not add imports at the top of the file.\n\n### Step 3: Insert EXIF transpose after opening direct-bytes images\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 187 (inside Image.decode_example, in the `else:` branch when `bytes_` is not None), immediately after `image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))`\nOwnership: Shared file - I handle only this insertion point\nAction: Modify (insert lines after the assignment)\nBefore Code:\n```\nelse:\n    image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\nimage.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\nelse:\n    image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n    try:\n        from PIL import ImageOps\n        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n    except Exception:\n        pass\nimage.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n```\nCritical Details: Ensure this block remains before `image.load()` so Agent 3\u2019s CMYK\u2192RGB conversion can be inserted immediately after `image.load()` and Agent 2\u2019s crop logic will go after the optional mode conversion later.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.
