Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The bash command to execute.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Then sum ideal discounted gains over `ideal_rels[:ideal_k]`.\n- Edge cases: If all relevance scores for expected IDs are zero, IDCG becomes zero; existing guard returns 0.0 NDCG remains unchanged.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Update IDCG calculation to use expected relevant document count\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Lines 392-406 inside `NDCG.compute`\nAction: Replace the existing IDCG block comment and `ideal_length` logic with the corrected logic using `expected_ids` count and `top_k`.\nBefore Code:\n```\n        # Calculate IDCG using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        # Since we can't achieve better than perfect ranking of all relevant docs\n        if relevance_scores is not None:\n            ideal_rels = sorted(\n                [relevance_scores.get(docid, 0.0) for docid in expected_ids],\n                reverse=True,\n            )\n        else:\n            ideal_rels = [1.0] * len(expected_ids)\n\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(ideal_rels))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=rel, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, rel in enumerate(ideal_rels[:ideal_length], start=1)\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        # Calculate IDCG over the expected relevant documents, respecting top_k if provided.\n        # This normalizes by the best possible ranking of all expected relevant docs,\n        # rather than the number of retrieved results.\n        if relevance_scores is not None:\n            ideal_rels = sorted(\n                [relevance_scores.get(docid, 0.0) for docid in expected_ids],\n                reverse=True,\n            )\n        else:\n            ideal_rels = [1.0] * len(expected_ids)\n\n        # Determine how many ideal positions to consider: all expected relevant docs,\n        # capped by top_k if specified.\n        ideal_k = len(ideal_rels) if self.top_k is None else min(self.top_k, len(ideal_rels))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=rel, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, rel in enumerate(ideal_rels[:ideal_k], start=1)\n        )\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve graded relevance by sorting `ideal_rels` in descending order when `relevance_scores` is provided.\n- Do not reference `len(retrieved_ids)` for IDCG sizing; only use `expected_ids` length and `top_k`.\n- Leave the later zero-IDCG guard unchanged.\n\n### Step 2: Add clarifying inline comment (no signature changes)\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Immediately above the new `ideal_k` computation (line directly before `ideal_k = ...`).\nAction: Already included in Step 1 as a two-line explanatory comment to avoid separate edits.\nCritical Details:\n- Keep changes minimal to avoid conflicts with the other agent\u2019s upcoming refactor and docstring updates.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\n- My ownership (this PR, executed first):\n  - Modify only the IDCG computation inside `NDCG.compute` (lines 392-406 replaced), no changes to function signature or the rest of the file.\n- Other agent\u2019s ownership (to implement after my change lands):\n  - May introduce `_get_relevance` and `_compute_idcg` helpers inside `NDCG` and refactor `compute` to use them, including maintaining binary default behavior and using expected-based IDCG sizing consistent with this fix.\n  - May update the `compute` signature/documentation as needed for graded relevance; ensure IDCG continues to be based on expected relevant documents, respecting `top_k`.\n- No other files or lines will be modified by me.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

This led to inaccurate normalization and scoring behavior, particularly in cases where the number of relevant documents differed from the number of retrieved documents. A previous fix attempt did not address this underlying issue.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe fix redefines the IDCG calculation to iterate over the number of expected relevant documents, aligning with standard definitions of NDCG. \n\n**Files Modified**\n* llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for llama_index_task_task17070_feature1\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T14:07:22.946154\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: NDCG currently computes IDCG length using the number of retrieved documents, which can inflate NDCG when fewer documents are retrieved than the number of relevant documents. This deviates from computing the ideal ranking over expected relevant documents.\n- Goal: Correct IDCG computation to iterate over expected relevant documents (respecting top_k if provided) rather than retrieved documents.\n- Requirements:\n  - Do not change function signatures or introduce new helpers (per coordination agreement; other agent will add helpers later).\n  - Keep graded relevance behavior intact if relevance_scores are provided.\n  - Maintain existing behavior of top_k truncation for retrieved_ids.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File to modify: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\n- Class: `NDCG`\n- Method: `compute`\n- Current IDCG logic: uses `ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(ideal_rels))` and sums over that length.\n- Fix: Compute IDCG over the count of expected relevant docs, capped by `top_k` if provided: `ideal_k = len(ideal_rels)` when `top_k` is None, else `ideal_k = min(self.top_k, len(ideal_rels))`. Then sum ideal discounted gains over `ideal_rels[:ideal_k]`.\n- Edge cases: If all relevance scores for expected IDs are zero, IDCG becomes zero; existing guard returns 0.0 NDCG remains unchanged.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Update IDCG calculation to use expected relevant document count\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Lines 392-406 inside `NDCG.compute`\nAction: Replace the existing IDCG block comment and `ideal_length` logic with the corrected logic using `expected_ids` count and `top_k`.\nBefore Code:\n```\n        # Calculate IDCG using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        # Since we can't achieve better than perfect ranking of all relevant docs\n        if relevance_scores is not None:\n            ideal_rels = sorted(\n                [relevance_scores.get(docid, 0.0) for docid in expected_ids],\n                reverse=True,\n            )\n        else:\n            ideal_rels = [1.0] * len(expected_ids)\n\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(ideal_rels))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=rel, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, rel in enumerate(ideal_rels[:ideal_length], start=1)\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        # Calculate IDCG over the expected relevant documents, respecting top_k if provided.\n        # This normalizes by the best possible ranking of all expected relevant docs,\n        # rather than the number of retrieved results.\n        if relevance_scores is not None:\n            ideal_rels = sorted(\n                [relevance_scores.get(docid, 0.0) for docid in expected_ids],\n                reverse=True,\n            )\n        else:\n            ideal_rels = [1.0] * len(expected_ids)\n\n        # Determine how many ideal positions to consider: all expected relevant docs,\n        # capped by top_k if specified.\n        ideal_k = len(ideal_rels) if self.top_k is None else min(self.top_k, len(ideal_rels))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=rel, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, rel in enumerate(ideal_rels[:ideal_k], start=1)\n        )\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve graded relevance by sorting `ideal_rels` in descending order when `relevance_scores` is provided.\n- Do not reference `len(retrieved_ids)` for IDCG sizing; only use `expected_ids` length and `top_k`.\n- Leave the later zero-IDCG guard unchanged.\n\n### Step 2: Add clarifying inline comment (no signature changes)\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Immediately above the new `ideal_k` computation (line directly before `ideal_k = ...`).\nAction: Already included in Step 1 as a two-line explanatory comment to avoid separate edits.\nCritical Details:\n- Keep changes minimal to avoid conflicts with the other agent\u2019s upcoming refactor and docstring updates.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\n- My ownership (this PR, executed first):\n  - Modify only the IDCG computation inside `NDCG.compute` (lines 392-406 replaced), no changes to function signature or the rest of the file.\n- Other agent\u2019s ownership (to implement after my change lands):\n  - May introduce `_get_relevance` and `_compute_idcg` helpers inside `NDCG` and refactor `compute` to use them, including maintaining binary default behavior and using expected-based IDCG sizing consistent with this fix.\n  - May update the `compute` signature/documentation as needed for graded relevance; ensure IDCG continues to be based on expected relevant documents, respecting `top_k`.\n- No other files or lines will be modified by me.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

document graded relevance for NDCG. Exact edits:\n- File: /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py\n  - Lines 321-333: Replace the NDCG class docstring to state graded relevance support and discounted gain modes.\n  - Lines 347-361: Replace the NDCG.compute method docstring to document the optional relevance_scores: Dict[str, float] parameter and behavior.\nI will not touch any other lines or logic (e.g., compute body at lines 371-393). Please let me know if you're modifying these same line ranges; if so, we can split sections to avoid overlap. Otherwise, I'll proceed in ~2 minutes.\nFrom agent_3 at 2025-10-22T04:44:32.825931: Proceeding to modify the compute() docstring next.\n- File: /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py\n  - Lines 347-361 will be replaced to document relevance_scores behavior precisely.\nI have already modified lines 321-337 (class NDCG docstring) to reflect graded relevance. Let me know if you're touching these same ranges.\nFrom agent_3 at 2025-10-22T04:46:15.288519: Adjusting previously modified docstrings to remove references to a non-existent `top_k` attribute in NDCG.\n- File: /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py\n  - I will modify lines 321-337 (class NDCG docstring) and lines 351-372 (compute() docstring) again to correct wording. No other lines will be changed.\nFrom agent_3 at 2025-10-22T04:46:53.081286: Docstring updates complete:\n- Modified /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py lines 321-335 (NDCG class docstring) and 349-370 (compute docstring). No changes to logic. Please avoid editing these exact ranges to prevent conflicts.\nI will now commit locally; note that the repo does not appear to be a standard git repo in this environment.
