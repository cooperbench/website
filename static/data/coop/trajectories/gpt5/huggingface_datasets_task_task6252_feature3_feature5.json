Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Users currently need to manually resize after decoding.\n- Goal: Add an optional max_resolution parameter to the Image feature that clamps the image\u2019s longest side during decode while maintaining aspect ratio.\n- Requirements:\n  - Add new dataclass field: max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n  - Perform proportional downscale in decode_example using Pillow\u2019s thumbnail method if either dimension exceeds max_resolution\n  - Maintain existing behavior when max_resolution is None\n  - Do not modify docstrings (the other agent will add documentation updates for both features)\n  - Place resize before mode conversion and before the other agent\u2019s as_array conversion\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File to modify: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- New field placement: directly after existing field `mode`\n- Decode flow:\n  1) Open image\n  2) image.load() (already present)\n  3) NEW: If self.max_resolution is a positive integer and the image is larger than that size in either dimension, call image.thumbnail((max_res, max_res), resample=<LANCZOS fallback>)\n  4) Existing: mode conversion if self.mode is set\n  5) Other agent will add optional as_array conversion after mode conversion\n- Resampling fallback for Pillow versions:\n  - Prefer PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS\n  - Else PIL.Image.LANCZOS\n  - Else PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS (very old Pillow)\n- Validation: If max_resolution is not None but not a positive int, issue a warning and skip resizing (no exception to preserve backward compatibility)\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution dataclass field\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: After line 84 (inside the Image dataclass fields)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code (lines 84-86):\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Do not change any other lines in the dataclass block.\n- Keep field order as: mode, max_resolution, decode, id.\n\n### Step 2: Add resize logic in decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Insert immediately after line 188 (right after `image.load()` and before the existing mode-conversion block)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code (lines 188-191):\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # Optionally clamp image size to a maximum resolution while preserving aspect ratio\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            try:\n                max_res = int(self.max_resolution)\n            except Exception:\n                max_res = None\n            if max_res is not None and max_res > 0 and (image.width > max_res or image.height > max_res):\n                # Select a robust resampling filter across Pillow versions\n                try:\n                    resample = PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS  # Pillow >= 9.1\n                except AttributeError:\n                    resample = getattr(PIL.Image, \"LANCZOS\", getattr(PIL.Image, \"ANTIALIAS\", PIL.Image.BICUBIC))\n                image.thumbnail((max_res, max_res), resample=resample)\n            elif self.max_resolution is not None and (max_res is None or max_res <= 0):\n                warnings.warn(\n                    f\"Image(max_resolution={self.max_resolution!r}) is not a positive integer. Skipping resize.\")\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Do not alter the existing mode-conversion logic and return statement positions beyond adding the new block before them.\n- The thumbnail method modifies the image in-place and keeps aspect ratio.\n- This logic must precede any subsequent conversion to arrays (to be added by the other agent) so arrays reflect resized content.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- My ownership:\n  - Add dataclass field: `max_resolution: Optional[int] = None` (after `mode`)\n  - Add resize logic in `decode_example` (after `image.load()` and before mode conversion)\n- Other agent\u2019s ownership:\n  - Add dataclass field: `as_array: bool = False` (to be inserted after `decode`)\n  - Add decode-time conversion to normalized float32 NumPy array in [0,1] immediately after the mode conversion block\n  - Update docstrings (Args and Returns) to document both `max_resolution` and `as_array` parameters and note the array return when `as_array=True`\n- Dependency/order:\n  - My resize logic runs before their array conversion ensuring arrays reflect clamped size.\n  - I will not modify docstrings; the other agent will perform a single-pass docstring update to avoid merge conflicts.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature5\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:50:06.547276\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Downstream pipelines often require NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. The current Image feature returns PIL.Image objects, requiring extra conversion and normalization.\n- Goal: Add an option to return a NumPy array normalized to [0, 1] with dtype float32 directly from the Image feature during decode.\n- Requirements:\n  - Introduce a new dataclass field as_array: bool = False in Image.\n  - When as_array is True, decode_example should return a NumPy array (float32, values in [0, 1]).\n  - Preserve existing behavior when as_array is False.\n  - Update Image docstring (Args and Returns) to reflect both the new as_array and the other agent\u2019s max_resolution parameter.\n  - Avoid merge conflicts with the other agent\u2019s max_resolution feature by coordinating insertion points.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File impacted: src/datasets/features/image.py (shared ownership with the other agent).\n- Coordination with other agent:\n  - Other agent owns: max_resolution field insertion (after mode) in the dataclass and the resize logic after image.load() and before mode conversion in decode_example.\n  - I own: as_array field insertion (after decode) and the array conversion/normalization logic added immediately after the mode conversion block and before the final return in decode_example; I also own all docstring updates (Args/Returns) for both features in one pass.\n  - Import changes: None required (numpy is already imported; PIL is imported locally in decode_example).\n- Normalization rules:\n  - Integer types: divide by the dtype max (np.iinfo(dtype).max) after casting to float32.\n  - Floating types: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1] (no dynamic rescaling based on image content).\n  - Boolean (rare with PIL): treat as integer with max of 1.\n  - Shapes preserved (e.g., HxW or HxWxC).\n- Type hints:\n  - Update decode_example return type to Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray].\n  - ClassVar dtype remains \"PIL.Image.Image\" to avoid broader breaking changes in the feature system.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Insert as_array dataclass field\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Line 86 (insert a new line after the decode field at line 85)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    as_array: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: The other agent will add max_resolution: Optional[int] = None directly after mode as per coordination. My insertion remains after decode and before id.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring (Args section) to include max_resolution and as_array\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Lines 62-68 (replace and extend the Args block lines)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n        Args:\n            mode (`str`, *optional*):\n                The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n                Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n                returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        Args:\n            mode (`str`, *optional*):\n                The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            max_resolution (`int`, *optional*):\n                If provided, clamps the longest side of the image to this value while preserving aspect ratio using\n                Pillow's thumbnail. Applied during decode.\n            decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n                Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n                returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n            as_array (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n                If `True`, returns a NumPy array with dtype `float32` and values scaled to the range [0, 1]\n                instead of a `PIL.Image.Image`.\n```\nCritical Details: This consolidates both features' documentation in one pass per our agreement. The other agent will not modify docstrings.\n\n### Step 3: Update decode_example return type annotation\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Line 134\nAction: Replace function signature line\nBefore Code:\n```\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray]:\n```\nCritical Details: Union is already imported from typing. np is imported at top of file.\n\n### Step 4: Update decode_example docstring Returns to mention NumPy array when as_array=True\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Lines 149-151\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image`\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image` or `np.ndarray`:\n                If `as_array=True`, returns a NumPy array of dtype `float32` with values in [0, 1]. Otherwise, returns\n                a `PIL.Image.Image`.\n```\nCritical Details: Keep indentation and docstring formatting consistent.\n\n### Step 5: Add as_array conversion and normalization just before the final return in decode_example\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Line 191 (replace the single return line at the end of decode_example)\nAction: Replace (expand the return block)\nBefore Code:\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # If requested, return a normalized float32 NumPy array in [0, 1]\n        if self.as_array:\n            arr = np.asarray(image)\n            if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating):\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n                # Ensure values lie within [0, 1]\n                if arr.size > 0 and (arr.min() < 0.0 or arr.max() > 1.0):\n                    arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) or arr.dtype == np.bool_:\n                # Scale by the maximum representable value of the integer dtype\n                denom = float(np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max) if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) else 1.0\n                if denom == 0.0:\n                    denom = 1.0\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / denom\n            else:\n                # Fallback: cast then clip into [0,1]\n                arr = np.asarray(image, dtype=np.float32)\n                if arr.size > 0:\n                    arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            return arr\n\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- This block must come after any resize logic (owned by the other agent) and after the optional mode conversion.\n- The other agent agreed not to modify this tail return; they only insert their resize logic between image.load() and the mode conversion block.\n\n### Step 6: No import changes required\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Top of file\nAction: None\nCritical Details: numpy is already imported as np; PIL is imported locally inside decode_example.\n\n### Step 7: Coordination boundary confirmation (non-code)\n- Other agent will:\n  - Insert `max_resolution: Optional[int] = None` after `mode` in the dataclass fields.\n  - Insert thumbnail-based resize after `image.load()` and before the mode conversion, with a resampling fallback as they specified.\n  - Avoid editing docstrings and the tail end of decode_example where the as_array logic and final return reside.\n- I will:\n  - Implement as_array field, docstrings (including their parameter docs), return type update, and the conversion logic after mode conversion.\n\n### Step 8: Sanity check guidance (non-code)\n- After both changes, the decode flow should be:\n  1) Open and load image bytes/path (existing behavior).\n  2) Resize via max_resolution (other agent).\n  3) Optional mode conversion (existing behavior).\n  4) If as_array=True: convert to NumPy, normalize to float32 in [0,1], return array.\n  5) Else return PIL.Image.Image as before.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature5\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:50:06.547276\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Downstream pipelines often require NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. The current Image feature returns PIL.Image objects, requiring extra conversion and normalization.\n- Goal: Add an option to return a NumPy array normalized to [0, 1] with dtype float32 directly from the Image feature during decode.\n- Requirements:\n  - Introduce a new dataclass field as_array: bool = False in Image.\n  - When as_array is True, decode_example should return a NumPy array (float32, values in [0, 1]).\n  - Preserve existing behavior when as_array is False.\n  - Update Image docstring (Args and Returns) to reflect both the new as_array and the other agent\u2019s max_resolution parameter.\n  - Avoid merge conflicts with the other agent\u2019s max_resolution feature by coordinating insertion points.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File impacted: src/datasets/features/image.py (shared ownership with the other agent).\n- Coordination with other agent:\n  - Other agent owns: max_resolution field insertion (after mode) in the dataclass and the resize logic after image.load() and before mode conversion in decode_example.\n  - I own: as_array field insertion (after decode) and the array conversion/normalization logic added immediately after the mode conversion block and before the final return in decode_example; I also own all docstring updates (Args/Returns) for both features in one pass.\n  - Import changes: None required (numpy is already imported; PIL is imported locally in decode_example).\n- Normalization rules:\n  - Integer types: divide by the dtype max (np.iinfo(dtype).max) after casting to float32.\n  - Floating types: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1] (no dynamic rescaling based on image content).\n  - Boolean (rare with PIL): treat as integer with max of 1.\n  - Shapes preserved (e.g., HxW or HxWxC).\n- Type hints:\n  - Update decode_example return type to Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray].\n  - ClassVar dtype remains \"PIL.Image.Image\" to avoid broader breaking changes in the feature system.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Insert as_array dataclass field\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Line 86 (insert a new line after the decode field at line 85)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    as_array: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: The other agent will add max_resolution: Optional[int] = None directly after mode as per coordination. My insertion remains after decode and before id.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring (Args section) to include max_resolution and as_array\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Lines 62-68 (replace and extend the Args block lines)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n        Args:\n            mode (`str`, *optional*):\n                The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n                Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n                returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        Args:\n            mode (`str`, *optional*):\n                The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            max_resolution (`int`, *optional*):\n                If provided, clamps the longest side of the image to this value while preserving aspect ratio using\n                Pillow's thumbnail. Applied during decode.\n            decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n                Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n                returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n            as_array (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n                If `True`, returns a NumPy array with dtype `float32` and values scaled to the range [0, 1]\n                instead of a `PIL.Image.Image`.\n```\nCritical Details: This consolidates both features' documentation in one pass per our agreement. The other agent will not modify docstrings.\n\n### Step 3: Update decode_example return type annotation\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Line 134\nAction: Replace function signature line\nBefore Code:\n```\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray]:\n```\nCritical Details: Union is already imported from typing. np is imported at top of file.\n\n### Step 4: Update decode_example docstring Returns to mention NumPy array when as_array=True\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Lines 149-151\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image`\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image` or `np.ndarray`:\n                If `as_array=True`, returns a NumPy array of dtype `float32` with values in [0, 1]. Otherwise, returns\n                a `PIL.Image.Image`.\n```\nCritical Details: Keep indentation and docstring formatting consistent.\n\n### Step 5: Add as_array conversion and normalization just before the final return in decode_example\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Line 191 (replace the single return line at the end of decode_example)\nAction: Replace (expand the return block)\nBefore Code:\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # If requested, return a normalized float32 NumPy array in [0, 1]\n        if self.as_array:\n            arr = np.asarray(image)\n            if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating):\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n                # Ensure values lie within [0, 1]\n                if arr.size > 0 and (arr.min() < 0.0 or arr.max() > 1.0):\n                    arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) or arr.dtype == np.bool_:\n                # Scale by the maximum representable value of the integer dtype\n                denom = float(np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max) if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) else 1.0\n                if denom == 0.0:\n                    denom = 1.0\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / denom\n            else:\n                # Fallback: cast then clip into [0,1]\n                arr = np.asarray(image, dtype=np.float32)\n                if arr.size > 0:\n                    arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            return arr\n\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- This block must come after any resize logic (owned by the other agent) and after the optional mode conversion.\n- The other agent agreed not to modify this tail return; they only insert their resize logic between image.load() and the mode conversion block.\n\n### Step 6: No import changes required\nFile: src/datasets/features/image.py\nLocation: Top of file\nAction: None\nCritical Details: numpy is already imported as np; PIL is imported locally inside decode_example.\n\n### Step 7: Coordination boundary confirmation (non-code)\n- Other agent will:\n  - Insert `max_resolution: Optional[int] = None` after `mode` in the dataclass fields.\n  - Insert thumbnail-based resize after `image.load()` and before the mode conversion, with a resampling fallback as they specified.\n  - Avoid editing docstrings and the tail end of decode_example where the as_array logic and final return reside.\n- I will:\n  - Implement as_array field, docstrings (including their parameter docs), return type update, and the conversion logic after mode conversion.\n\n### Step 8: Sanity check guidance (non-code)\n- After both changes, the decode flow should be:\n  1) Open and load image bytes/path (existing behavior).\n  2) Resize via max_resolution (other agent).\n  3) Optional mode conversion (existing behavior).\n  4) If as_array=True: convert to NumPy, normalize to float32 in [0,1], return array.\n  5) Else return PIL.Image.Image as before.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Based on your updates, the fields currently span lines 84-87. I will modify by inserting a new line after line 86.
