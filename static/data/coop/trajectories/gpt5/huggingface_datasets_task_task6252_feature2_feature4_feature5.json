Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Some images contain unwanted borders/watermarks at the edges, requiring manual post-decoding cropping which adds overhead.\nGoal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to the Image feature to automatically crop a uniform pixel margin from all four sides during decoding.\nRequirements:\n- New dataclass field: crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n- Update Image docstring Args to document crop_margin\n- In decode_example(), after image.load() and before any mode conversion, crop borders using Pillow\u2019s crop\n- Coordinate with Agent 1 (crop_to_square) and Agent 3 (as_array) to avoid merge conflicts with shared file src/datasets/features/image.py\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared file with Agent 1 and Agent 3: src/datasets/features/image.py\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: crop_to_square bool field and center-cropping logic after border crop and before mode conversion; docstring entry\n- Agent 3: as_array bool field and conversion logic after mode conversion; docstring entry; adjust return annotation\nShared File Strategy:\n- Field order: mode, decode, as_array (Agent 3), crop_margin (mine), crop_to_square (Agent 1), id\n- Docstring order under Args: decode (existing), as_array (Agent 3), crop_margin (mine), crop_to_square (Agent 1), then Examples\n- decode_example() order: image.load(); [crop_margin block]; [crop_to_square block]; mode conversion; [as_array conversion block]; return image\n- Insert explicit comment anchors: # [crop_margin block START]/END, # [crop_to_square block], # [as_array conversion block]\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature is a dataclass used by datasets to encode/decode images.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Optional Image Border Cropping Support\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature, allowing users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding. This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Some images contain unwanted borders/watermarks at the edges, requiring manual post-decoding cropping which adds overhead.\nGoal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to the Image feature to automatically crop a uniform pixel margin from all four sides during decoding.\nRequirements:\n- New dataclass field: crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n- Update Image docstring Args to document crop_margin\n- In decode_example(), after image.load() and before any mode conversion, crop borders using Pillow\u2019s crop\n- Coordinate with Agent 1 (crop_to_square) and Agent 3 (as_array) to avoid merge conflicts with shared file src/datasets/features/image.py\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared file with Agent 1 and Agent 3: src/datasets/features/image.py\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: crop_to_square bool field and center-cropping logic after border crop and before mode conversion; docstring entry\n- Agent 3: as_array bool field and conversion logic after mode conversion; docstring entry; adjust return annotation\nShared File Strategy:\n- Field order: mode, decode, as_array (Agent 3), crop_margin (mine), crop_to_square (Agent 1), id\n- Docstring order under Args: decode (existing), as_array (Agent 3), crop_margin (mine), crop_to_square (Agent 1), then Examples\n- decode_example() order: image.load(); [crop_margin block]; [crop_to_square block]; mode conversion; [as_array conversion block]; return image\n- Insert explicit comment anchors: # [crop_margin block START]/END, # [crop_to_square block], # [as_array conversion block]\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature is a dataclass used by datasets to encode/decode images. We extend it with an optional crop stage in decode_example(). Cropping uses PIL.Image.crop with a rectangle (margin, margin, width - margin, height - margin). Margin is clamped to avoid over-cropping beyond image center.\nCritical Notes:\n- crop_margin applies only when decode=True\n- Accept None or 0 as no-op; non-positive values result in no crop\n- Clamp crop to at most half the smaller image dimension\n- Keep mode conversion and other agents\u2019 blocks placement intact to respect agreed pipeline order\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add dataclass field `crop_margin`\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 84-87 (between existing decode and id fields)\nOwnership: Shared - I handle insertion of crop_margin\nAction: Modify (insert new field)\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep indentation aligned with existing fields\n- Do not change existing field names or order beyond this insertion (Agent 3 will add as_array above, Agent 1 will add crop_to_square after this field per agreement)\n\n### Step 2: Document `crop_margin` in the Image docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: After the decode argument description and immediately before the \"Examples:\" section (around lines 66-69)\nOwnership: Shared - I add crop_margin docs\nAction: Insert lines in docstring\nBefore Code (excerpt lines 63-71):\n```\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n\n        Examples:\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "action": "system", "args": {"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Optional Center-Cropping to Square for Decoded Images\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis feature introduces a `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class, enabling automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding. The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Add an optional center-cropping-to-square capability to the Image feature so decoded images can be uniformly square without external preprocessing.\nGoal: Introduce a new parameter crop_to_square: bool = False on the Image feature and apply a centered square crop during decode before mode conversion.\nRequirements:\n- Add dataclass field crop_to_square: bool = False.\n- Document the parameter in the Image class docstring under Args.\n- In decode_example(), after image.load() and after border-crop (Agent 2), perform center-crop-to-square when enabled, before any mode conversion. Add anchor comments for coordination.\n- Avoid changing return annotations or other behavior to preserve compatibility with other agents\u2019 planned changes.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared file with other agents: `src/datasets/features/image.py`.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 2: Adds crop_margin and corresponding border-crop block.\n- Agent 3: Adds as_array flag and conversion block, and updates return annotation/docstring for decode_example.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Dataclass fields order: mode, decode, as_array (Agent 3), crop_margin (Agent 2), crop_to_square (mine), id.\n- Add explicit anchor comments in code for shared blocks: `# [crop_margin block]`, `# [crop_to_square block START/END]`, `# [as_array conversion block]`.\n- Place my crop_to_square field after the placeholders for as_array and crop_margin fields, before id.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature decodes with PIL. We\u2019ll add a boolean flag to the dataclass and, if set, crop the loaded PIL image to a centered square using the shorter side, prior to mode conversion and any as_array post-processing.\nCritical Notes:\n- Cropping occurs after `image.load()` to ensure the file handle is closed and image is fully loaded.\n- Cropping happens before mode conversion to minimize any secondary processing artifacts.\n- The block is guarded by `if self.crop_to_square:` and only runs when needed.\n- Add non-functional anchor comments for Agents 2 and 3 to patch their logic without conflicts.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Insert crop_to_square dataclass field (with anchors for other fields)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 86 (immediately before the existing `id: Optional[str] = None`)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    # [as_array field]  # Agent 3 will insert their field here\n    # [crop_margin field]  # Agent 2 will insert their field here\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Maintain 4-space indentation inside the dataclass. Do not modify the surrounding dtype/pa_type/_type fields.\n\n### Step 2: Document the new parameter in the class docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 62-69 (Args section, insert before \"Examples:\")\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format {\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}.\n\n    Examples:\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format {\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            If `True`, center-crops the image to a square after any border crop and before mode conversion.\n\n    Examples:\n```\nCritical Details: Keep indentation and backticks exactly as shown. Other agents will add their own doc entries above this one per coordination, but this block stands alone without referencing those entries.\n\n### Step 3: Add center-crop-to-square logic during decoding\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: After `image.load()` at current line 188 and before mode conversion block\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # [crop_margin block]\n        # [crop_to_square block START]\n        if self.crop_to_square:\n            width, height = image.size\n            if width != height:\n                side = min(width, height)\n                left = (width - side) // 2\n                upper = (height - side) // 2\n                right = left + side\n                lower = upper + side\n                image = image.crop((left, upper, right, lower))\n        # [crop_to_square block END]\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve existing indentation (8 spaces within the method body).\n- The marker `# [crop_margin block]` is a placeholder for Agent 2.\n- Do not alter the mode conversion block or return statement positions beyond inserting our block directly above them.\n- No changes to function annotations or return type; Agent 3 will handle as_array conversion after mode conversion.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Add an optional center-cropping-to-square capability to the Image feature so decoded images can be uniformly square without external preprocessing.\nGoal: Introduce a new parameter crop_to_square: bool = False on the Image feature and apply a centered square crop during decode before mode conversion.\nRequirements:\n- Add dataclass field crop_to_square: bool = False.\n- Document the parameter in the Image class docstring under Args.\n- In decode_example(), after image.load() and after border-crop (Agent 2), perform center-crop-to-square when enabled, before any mode conversion. Add anchor comments for coordination.\n- Avoid changing return annotations or other behavior to preserve compatibility with other agents\u2019 planned changes.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared file with other agents: `src/datasets/features/image.py`.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 2: Adds crop_margin and corresponding border-crop block.\n- Agent 3: Adds as_array flag and conversion block, and updates return annotation/docstring for decode_example.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Dataclass fields order: mode, decode, as_array (Agent 3), crop_margin (Agent 2), crop_to_square (mine), id.\n- Add explicit anchor comments in code for shared blocks: `# [crop_margin block]`, `# [crop_to_square block START/END]`, `# [as_array conversion block]`.\n- Place my crop_to_square field after the placeholders for as_array and crop_margin fields, before id.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature decodes with PIL. We\u2019ll add a boolean flag to the dataclass and, if set, crop the loaded PIL image to a centered square using the shorter side, prior to mode conversion and any as_array post-processing.\nCritical Notes:\n- Cropping occurs after `image.load()` to ensure the file handle is closed and image is fully loaded.\n- Cropping happens before mode conversion to minimize any secondary processing artifacts.\n- The block is guarded by `if self.crop_to_square:` and only runs when needed.\n- Add non-functional anchor comments for Agents 2 and 3 to patch their logic without conflicts.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Insert crop_to_square dataclass field (with anchors for other fields)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 86 (immediately before the existing `id: Optional[str] = None`)\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    # [as_array field]  # Agent 3 will insert their field here\n    # [crop_margin field]  # Agent 2 will insert their field here\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Maintain 4-space indentation inside the dataclass. Do not modify the surrounding dtype/pa_type/_type fields.\n\n### Step 2: Document the new parameter in the class docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 62-69 (Args section, insert before \"Examples:\")\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

If None or 0, no crop.\n     - I did not touch the existing decode docs and left space for other agents\u2019 entries.\n\n  3) decode_example() body:\n     - Insert border-crop block immediately AFTER image.load() and BEFORE mode conversion.\n     - Current lines after my change:\n       193: image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n       194-208: border-crop block\n       210-211: mode conversion\n       212: return image\n     - I did not alter the mode conversion or return placement.\n\nWhat I implemented\n- Dataclass field: Added crop_margin: Optional[int] = None before id.\n- Docstring: Added crop_margin argument description under Args, explaining behavior and no-op for None/0.\n- Decoding pipeline: After image.load(), if self.crop_margin is a positive int, clamp margin to at most half of min(width, height) and crop via image.crop((m, m, w - m, h - m)).\n\nImportant notes\n- crop_margin only applies when decode=True (decode_example() is used).\n- Invalid values (None, 0, negative, or non-int) result in no cropping.\n- I carefully inserted the border-crop block after image.load() and before mode conversion, leaving room for other agents\u2019 crop_to_square and as_array conversions in the agreed order.\n- I ensured the earlier accidental misplaced insertion (briefly put inside the xopen context) was corrected; the crop block is now right after image.load().\n\nStatus\n- All planned edits done.\n- File parses successfully (syntax OK).\n- No tests were provided; I didn\u2019t run a test suite.\n- This branch hasn\u2019t made any Git commits because this workspace isn\u2019t a Git repo.\n\nMessage to collaborating agents\n- Dataclass fields final:\n  - mode at 88, decode at 89, crop_margin at 90, id at 91, auto-constructed at 92.\n- Docstring Args final:\n  - crop_margin docs at 69-71; Examples start at 73+.\n- decode_example body final:\n  - image.load() at 193\n  - border-crop block at 194-208\n  - mode conversion at 210-211\n  - return image at 212\n- Please avoid editing these exact lines to prevent conflicts.
