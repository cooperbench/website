Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The bash command to execute.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

If `self.mode` is set, that conversion still applies after our normalization.\n\n### Step 2: Add a Notes section to the Image class docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Image class docstring, after the Examples code block and before the closing triple quote (currently ends at line 82)\nAction: Insert lines\nBefore Code (context lines 74-82):\n```\n74     >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n75     Image(decode=True, id=None)\n76     >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n77     <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n78     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n79     {'bytes': None,\n80      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n81     ```\n82     \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n74     >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n75     Image(decode=True, id=None)\n76     >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n77     <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n78     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n79     {'bytes': None,\n80      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n81     ```\n82 \n83     Notes:\n84         - During decoding, images with mode 'CMYK' are automatically converted to 'RGB' to improve compatibility\n85           with downstream libraries and models.

Use the added comment anchor `# Normalize CMYK images to RGB for downstream compatibility` and the guidance line `# (Other agent) Place crop_margin ...` to position the code safely.\n- Dependency/order:\n  - I implement first. My normalization runs immediately after image.load(). The other agent then adds cropping just below my block. No other dependencies.\n- Imports/signatures: I will not add imports or change method signatures. The other agent will not modify the anchor lines I added nor the `if self.mode ...` conversion line order.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

This does not modify the Parameters section (owned by the other agent).\n- Preserve existing behavior: If `self.mode` is set, that conversion still runs after our normalization step (e.g., if `mode='L'`, the image will end up in L after passing through RGB normalization for CMYK sources).\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add CMYK\u2192RGB normalization in decode path\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Image.decode_example, After line 188 (right after `image.load()`), before line 189 (`if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:`)\nAction: Insert block\nBefore Code (context lines 184-191):\n```\n184                     with xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n185                         bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\n186                     image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n187         else:\n188             image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n189         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n190         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n191             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n184                     with xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n185                         bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\n186                     image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n187         else:\n188             image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n189         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n190         # Normalize CMYK images to RGB for downstream compatibility\n191         try:\n192             im_mode = image.mode\n193         except Exception:\n194             im_mode = None\n195         if isinstance(im_mode, str) and (im_mode == \"CMYK\" or im_mode.startswith(\"CMYK\")):\n196             image = image.convert(\"RGB\")\n197         # (Other agent) Place crop_margin cropping logic immediately after this block and before the mode conversion\n198         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n199             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Do not add new imports.\n- Keep the comment line as an anchor for the other agent to insert cropping logic below it and above the `if self.mode ...` block.\n- We intentionally run this before any user-specified `mode` conversion. If `self.mode` is set, that conversion still applies after our normalization.\n\n### Step 2: Add a Notes section to the Image class docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Image class docstring, after the Examples code block and before the closing triple quote (currently ends at line 82)\nAction: Insert lines\nBefore Code (context lines 74-82):\n```\n74     >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n75     Image(decode=True, id=None)\n76     >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n77     <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n78     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n79     {'bytes': None,\n80      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n81     ```\n82     \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n74     >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n75     Image(decode=True, id=None)\n76     >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n77     <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n78     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n79     {'bytes': None,\n80      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n81     ```\n82 \n83     Notes:\n84         - During decoding, images with mode 'CMYK' are automatically converted to 'RGB' to improve compatibility\n85           with downstream libraries and models.

Use the added comment anchor `# Normalize CMYK images to RGB for downstream compatibility` and the guidance line `# (Other agent) Place crop_margin ...` to position the code safely.\n- Dependency/order:\n  - I implement first. My normalization runs immediately after image.load(). The other agent then adds cropping just below my block. No other dependencies.\n- Imports/signatures: I will not add imports or change method signatures. The other agent will not modify the anchor lines I added nor the `if self.mode ...` conversion line order.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

Serialization is handled by datasets.utils.py_utils.asdict and features.generate_from_dict. Adding a new dataclass field is sufficient for persistence when value != default.\n- Decoding path is Image.decode_example; image opening occurs and image.load() is called.

The margin is clamped so that the resulting\n            width and height remain non-negative (at least 1 pixel in each dimension).\n\n    Examples:\n\"\"\"\nCritical Details:\n- Keep formatting and indentation consistent with existing Args section.\n- Do not alter the Examples section.\n- Leave room for the other agent to add a short Notes section after the Parameters section.\n\n### Step 2: Add crop_margin dataclass field\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Inside the Image dataclass field definitions, after `id: Optional[str] = None`.\nAction: Insert a new optional field.\nBefore Code (lines 84-91):\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\nAfter Code:\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\nCritical Details:\n- The default is None. This ensures asdict will include it only when set (value != default), enabling backward/forward compatibility in serialization.\n- No additional serialization methods are needed; Features.generate_from_dict will populate the field when present.\n\n### Step 3: Apply cropping in decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: In `Image.decode_example`, insert cropping block after the optional self.mode conversion (`if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode: ...`) and before `return image`.\nAction: Insert cropping logic.\nBefore Code (lines 188-191):\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\nAfter Code:\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # Optional uniform border cropping\n        if self.crop_margin is not None:\n            try:\n                margin = int(self.crop_margin)\n            except (TypeError, ValueError):\n                margin = 0\n            if margin > 0:\n                w, h = image.size\n                if w > 0 and h > 0:\n                    mw = min(margin, w // 2)\n                    mh = min(margin, h // 2)\n                    if mw > 0 or mh > 0:\n                        image = image.crop((mw, mh, w - mw, h - mh))\n        return image\nCritical Details:\n- Cropping runs after image.load() and after any requested mode conversion.\n- The other agent\u2019s CMYK->RGB conversion is placed immediately after `PIL.Image.open(...)`, so our cropping will still occur after their conversion.\n- Margin is clamped to ensure the resulting width/height are non-negative and at least 1 pixel when possible.\n- If crop_margin is 0/None/invalid, cropping is skipped gracefully.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm serialization/deserialization behavior (no code changes)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py` and `src/datasets/utils/py_utils.py`\nLocation: N/A (reference only)\nAction: None (documentation/validation).\nCritical Details:\n- `asdict` (src/datasets/utils/py_utils.py) includes fields when value != default; thus crop_margin will serialize when set.\n- `Features.from_dict` uses `generate_from_dict` to pass known dataclass fields to constructors; the Image class will accept `crop_margin` transparently.\n\n### Step 5: Minimal doc maintenance (no code outside image.py)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Within the Image class docstring only.\nAction: Ensure parameter documentation for crop_margin is present and clearly separated so the other agent can add their \u201cNotes\u201d block afterward without conflict.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership:\n  - I own: `src/datasets/features/image.py` changes related to crop_margin (docstring parameter block, dataclass field addition, cropping logic in decode_example).\n  - Other agent owns: CMYK->RGB auto-conversion snippet placed immediately after image open in `decode_example`, and a short \u201cNotes\u201d paragraph in the Image class docstring after the Parameters section documenting the CMYK->RGB behavior.\n- Line positioning:\n  - My changes are anchored at:\n    - Docstring Args section (after decode param, before Examples)\n    - Dataclass fields (immediately after `id` field)\n    - In `decode_example`, after the self.mode conversion and before the `return image` line.\n  - I will not modify the lines where the other agent plans to insert their conversion (right after `PIL.Image.open(...)`).\n- Dependency/order:\n  - The other agent\u2019s CMYK->RGB conversion runs first (right after open).\n  - My cropping runs after load and after optional user mode conversion, before return.\n- Imports and signatures:\n  - No new imports or signature changes beyond adding the dataclass field.

This does not modify the Parameters section (owned by the other agent).\n- Preserve existing behavior: If `self.mode` is set, that conversion still runs after our normalization step (e.g., if `mode='L'`, the image will end up in L after passing through RGB normalization for CMYK sources).\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add CMYK\u2192RGB normalization in decode path\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Image.decode_example, After line 188 (right after `image.load()`), before line 189 (`if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:`)\nAction: Insert block\nBefore Code (context lines 184-191):\n```\n184                     with xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n185                         bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\n186                     image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n187         else:\n188             image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n189         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n190         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n191             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n184                     with xopen(path, \"rb\", download_config=download_config) as f:\n185                         bytes_ = BytesIO(f.read())\n186                     image = PIL.Image.open(bytes_)\n187         else:\n188             image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n189         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n190         # Normalize CMYK images to RGB for downstream compatibility\n191         try:\n192             im_mode = image.mode\n193         except Exception:\n194             im_mode = None\n195         if isinstance(im_mode, str) and (im_mode == \"CMYK\" or im_mode.startswith(\"CMYK\")):\n196             image = image.convert(\"RGB\")\n197         # (Other agent) Place crop_margin cropping logic immediately after this block and before the mode conversion\n198         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n199             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Do not add new imports.\n- Keep the comment line as an anchor for the other agent to insert cropping logic below it and above the `if self.mode ...` block.\n- We intentionally run this before any user-specified `mode` conversion. If `self.mode` is set, that conversion still applies after our normalization.\n\n### Step 2: Add a Notes section to the Image class docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Image class docstring, after the Examples code block and before the closing triple quote (currently ends at line 82)\nAction: Insert lines\nBefore Code (context lines 74-82):\n```\n74     >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n75     Image(decode=True, id=None)\n76     >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n77     <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n78     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n79     {'bytes': None,\n80      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n81     ```\n82     \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n74     >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n75     Image(decode=True, id=None)\n76     >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n77     <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n78     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n79     {'bytes': None,\n80      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n81     ```\n82 \n83     Notes:\n84         - During decoding, images with mode 'CMYK' are automatically converted to 'RGB' to improve compatibility\n85           with downstream libraries and models.

Use the added comment anchor `# Normalize CMYK images to RGB for downstream compatibility` and the guidance line `# (Other agent) Place crop_margin ...` to position the code safely.\n- Dependency/order:\n  - I implement first. My normalization runs immediately after image.load(). The other agent then adds cropping just below my block. No other dependencies.\n- Imports/signatures: I will not add imports or change method signatures.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature4\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T13:05:53.908442\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Some datasets contain consistent edge artifacts (watermarks/borders) that should be removed during decoding to simplify preprocessing.\n- Goal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to the Image feature to crop a uniform pixel margin from all four sides of an image during decoding.\n- Requirements:\n  - Introduce crop_margin: Optional[int] = None on Image.\n  - Apply cropping only when decode=True and crop_margin is a positive integer.\n  - Crop must happen after the other agent\u2019s CMYK->RGB auto-conversion and after image.load(), and before the final return. It should be safe with or without a user-specified mode conversion (self.mode).\n  - Serialize/deserialize seamlessly via existing dataclass/asdict mechanism.\n  - Update Image class docstring to document crop_margin.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Image is a dataclass in src/datasets/features/image.py. Serialization is handled by datasets.utils.py_utils.asdict and features.generate_from_dict. Adding a new dataclass field is sufficient for persistence when value != default.\n- Decoding path is Image.decode_example; image opening occurs and image.load() is called. We will insert cropping logic after image.load() and after the optional self.mode conversion block. The other agent will add a CMYK->RGB conversion block immediately after PIL.Image.open(...); our crop will therefore occur after their block as agreed.\n- Cropping implementation uses PIL.Image.Image.crop with a box (left, top, right, bottom). Margins are clamped to ensure non-negative size: margin_w = min(crop_margin, width // 2), margin_h = min(crop_margin, height // 2).\n- No new imports beyond Pillow already used.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Update Image class docstring to include crop_margin parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Class Image docstring Args section, after current `decode` parameter description.\nAction: Insert new parameter description lines.\nBefore Code (lines 62-69):\n\"\"\"\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Here are the exact edits I plan to make in /workspace/src/datasets/features/image.py to avoid conflicts:\n\n1) Docstring Args section: Insert new parameter docs for crop_margin immediately after line 67 (i.e., after the decode parameter description and before the 'Examples:' line at 69). I will only insert lines after 67; I won't touch any other docstring lines.\n\n2) Dataclass fields: Insert a new field `crop_margin: Optional[int] = None` after line 86 (right after `id: Optional[str] = None`). This is an insertion only.\n\n3) decode_example: Insert the cropping block after line 190 (right after the optional mode conversion and before the existing `return image` at line 191). This is an insertion only; I won't change existing lines.\n\nPlease avoid modifying those specific lines/ranges. For your CMYK->RGB auto-conversion, please place your changes strictly earlier in decode_example\u2014e.g., immediately after each PIL.Image.open(...) assignment occurring around lines 169, 185, and 187, or in a block right after the image variable is set and before line 188 (image.load()). Also, to prevent docstring conflicts, please do NOT edit the docstring; I'll include a short 'Notes' paragraph mentioning CMYK->RGB normalization so you can skip doc changes entirely.\n\nIf you need a different arrangement, let me know the exact line ranges you plan to change so we can divide them cleanly.", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 20, "timestamp": "2025-10-22T16:33:48.260569", "source": "agent", "message": "Task list has been updated with 8 items.

The other agent will add the docstring Notes and crop_margin parameter docs, as well as the crop_margin dataclass field and cropping block after the mode conversion and before return.\n- No new imports were added; behavior remains unchanged for non-CMYK images.\n\nValidation\n- Static syntax check via py_compile succeeded. Importing the module in this environment fails due to missing optional dependency pyarrow, which is unrelated to this change.\n\nCoordination status for agent_4\n- My changes are complete.
