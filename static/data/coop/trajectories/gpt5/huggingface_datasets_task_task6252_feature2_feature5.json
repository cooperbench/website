Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature2\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:33:12.127056\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Vision models often require square inputs, but images in datasets have varied aspect ratios. Users currently perform custom preprocessing to center-crop images to squares outside of datasets.\n- Goal: Add an optional boolean flag to the Image feature that, when decoding, center-crops images to a square using the shorter side before any mode conversion occurs.\n- Requirements:\n  - New flag name: crop_to_square: bool = False\n  - Apply crop during decode_example(), before mode conversion\n  - Default behavior unchanged when crop_to_square is False\n  - Ensure automatic serialization and deserialization of the flag within the features system\n  - Coordinate with another agent who adds as_array flag and array conversion at the end of decode\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- The Image feature is a dataclass serialized via Features.to_dict() (asdict) and reconstructed via features.generate_from_dict(). Adding a new dataclass field automatically participates in serialization/deserialization; no explicit to_dict/from_dict methods are present on Image.\n- Crop implementation will be inline using PIL.Image.crop, after image.load() and before any mode conversion.\n- Maintain current behavior for all other code paths. No changes to encode_example, cast_storage, embed_storage, etc.\n- The other agent will append an as_array flag and late-stage conversion to NumPy float32 array in [0,1]. We\u2019ll leave a clearly commented section sequencing to avoid conflicts.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square field to Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 84-87 (immediately after `decode: bool = True` and before `id`)\nAction: Insert new dataclass field\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Field order coordination: Other agent will add `as_array: bool = False` after `crop_to_square` and before `id` (or after id if they prefer end-of-args), but per our agreement, suggested final order is: mode, decode, crop_to_square, as_array, id.\n- No additional imports required.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring to document crop_to_square\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Docstring Args section around lines 62-69\nAction: Edit docstring to add parameter description\nBefore Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            If `True`, center-crop the decoded image to a square using the shorter side before any mode conversion.\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep existing formatting and indentation in the docstring.\n\n### Step 3: Apply center-crop to square during decode_example before mode conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: After `image.load()` (current line ~189) and before the mode conversion `if self.mode ...` block\nAction: Insert crop logic block\nBefore Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n\n        # Center-crop to square (crop_to_square feature)\n        if getattr(self, \"crop_to_square\", False):\n            w, h = image.size\n            if w != h:\n                side = w if w < h else h\n                left = (w - side) // 2\n                top = (h - side) // 2\n                image = image.crop((left, top, left + side, top + side))\n\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- The crop operation happens before mode conversion as agreed.\n- We used integer division to ensure pixel indices are integers; for odd differences, the crop is centered with a one-pixel bias acceptable by design.\n- No change to behavior if `crop_to_square` is False.\n\n### Step 4: Serialization/deserialization note (no code change)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py` and `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nAction: None (document behavior)\nDetails:\n- Because Image is a dataclass, Features.to_dict() uses asdict and features.generate_from_dict() reconstructs via dataclass field names. The new `crop_to_square` field is automatically serialized and deserialized; no explicit to_dict/from_dict additions are required.\n\n### Step 5: Preserve other behavior and avoid touching encoding paths\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: None\nDetails:\n- encode_example, cast_storage, embed_storage, and helpers remain unchanged.\n- This feature only affects decode-time behavior.\n\n### Step 6: Coordination placeholder for other agent (no code change by me)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Same decode_example section\nAction: Reserve placement order and comments for the other agent\nDetails:\n- The other agent will add after the mode conversion and before the final `return` a block marked:\n  `# Convert to NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature)`\n- They will return the NumPy array if `as_array` is True; otherwise, the function continues to return the PIL.Image.Image.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- Ownership:\n  - I own: crop_to_square field, docstring update, and center-crop logic insertion in decode_example\n  - Other agent owns: as_array field and the final-stage array conversion inside decode_example\n- Field order: I add `crop_to_square` right after `decode`. Other agent adds `as_array` immediately after `crop_to_square`.

Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature5\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:33:12.127439\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Downstream NumPy pipelines often require normalized float arrays, but Image currently returns PIL.Image only, forcing extra conversions.\n- Goal: Add a flag `as_array` to Image so that decoded images can be returned as NumPy arrays with dtype float32 scaled to [0, 1].\n- Requirements:\n  - New dataclass field: `as_array: bool = False` on Image.\n  - Serialization: rely on existing Features.asdict()/from_dict() so `as_array` is persisted when True, and omitted when False (default).\n  - Decoding: At the very end of decode_example(), after all PIL operations (including any cropping and mode conversions), if `as_array=True`, return a NumPy float32 array in [0,1] instead of a PIL.Image.\n  - Backward compatibility: When `as_array=False`, behavior remains unchanged. No change to Arrow storage.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File impacted: src/datasets/features/image.py only.\n- Field order coordination (shared with other agent): mode, decode, crop_to_square (theirs), as_array (mine), id.\n  - Other agent adds `crop_to_square: bool = False` after `decode` and before `id`.\n  - I insert `as_array: bool = False` immediately before the `id` field (i.e., after their `crop_to_square`) to avoid conflicts and match the agreed order.\n- Serialization: Features.to_dict() uses datasets.utils.py_utils.asdict which only serializes dataclass fields if they differ from default (or have special metadata). This is acceptable: if `as_array=True` it will be serialized, else omitted and default to False at load time.\n- decode_example flow ordering (agreed):\n  1) Load/ensure PIL.Image\n  2) Other agent: optional center-crop to square (crop_to_square feature)\n  3) Existing mode conversion (if self.mode)\n  4) My conversion: optional NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature), then return\n  5) Otherwise return PIL.Image\n- Normalization logic:\n  - If image array dtype is integer: divide by max value for that dtype (e.g., 255 for uint8, 65535 for uint16), cast to float32.\n  - If dtype is float: clip to [0,1], cast to float32.\n  - If dtype is boolean: cast to float32 (values 0 or 1 already comply).\n- Return type annotation of decode_example updated to Union[PIL.Image.Image, np.ndarray] for clarity (no runtime impact).\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- The other agent owns and implements:\n  - New field: `crop_to_square: bool = False` positioned after `decode` and before `id`.\n  - decode_example() center-crop block placed between `image.load()` and the existing mode conversion, with header comment: `# Center-crop to square (crop_to_square feature)`.\n- I own and implement:\n  - New field: `as_array: bool = False` positioned after their `crop_to_square` and before `id`.\n  - decode_example() array conversion block placed after the mode conversion and before the return, with header comment: `# Convert to NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature)`.\n- Dependency order:\n  - Their crop_to_square code lands first.\n  - My as_array conversion must be applied after any PIL-based operations and after mode conversion.\n- No helper functions added by either party; no changes to Arrow pa_type.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add `as_array` field to Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Immediately before the existing `id: Optional[str] = None` line (currently line 86). This ensures placement after the other agent's `crop_to_square` field once it is added.\nAction: Insert one new dataclass field line\nBefore Code (excerpt around fields, current):\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     id: Optional[str] = None\n87     # Automatically constructed\n88     dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nAfter Code (inserted line 86; `id` moves down by one line):\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     as_array: bool = False\n87     id: Optional[str] = None\n88     # Automatically constructed\n89     dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nCritical Details:\n- If the other agent\u2019s `crop_to_square: bool = False` field is already present between `decode` and `id`, keep it untouched and still insert `as_array: bool = False` immediately before `id`.\n- Do not modify any other fields or class variables.\n\n### Step 2: Update decode_example return type annotation\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 134 (function signature)\nAction: Replace return type annotation to reflect possible ndarray return\nBefore Code:\n```\n134     def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n134     def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray]:\n```\nCritical Details:\n- No functional changes here; just an annotation update. `Union` is already imported at top.\n\n### Step 3: Add array conversion and normalization at the end of decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Just before the final `return image` (currently line 191). Ensure this block is after the existing mode conversion block, and after the other agent\u2019s crop block.\nAction: Insert new block\nBefore Code (tail of function):\n```\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n190             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n191         return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n188         image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n189         if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n190             image = image.convert(self.mode)\n191         # Convert to NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature)\n192         if getattr(self, \"as_array\", False):\n193             arr = np.array(image)\n194             # Normalize based on dtype\n195             if arr.dtype == np.bool_:\n196                 arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n197             elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer):\n198                 max_value = np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max\n199                 arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / float(max_value) if max_value > 0 else arr.astype(np.float32)\n200             elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating):\n201                 arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n202                 arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n203             else:\n204                 # Fallback: ensure float32 dtype\n205                 arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n206             return arr\n207         return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the other agent\u2019s crop block earlier (between `image.load()` and mode conversion) intact.\n- Keep behavior identical when `as_array=False`.\n- Ensure output is HWC np.ndarray with dtype np.float32 and values in [0,1] for integer inputs; floats are clipped to [0,1].\n\n### Step 4: No changes required to serialization helpers\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nAction: None\nCritical Details:\n- Image.feature serialization is handled by datasets.utils.py_utils.asdict and features.generate_from_dict. Adding a new dataclass field is automatically supported. When `as_array=True`, it will appear in to_dict()/from_dict(); when False, it will be omitted and default back to False.\n\n### Step 5: No helper functions or new imports required\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: None\nCritical Details:\n- numpy is already imported as np at top of file; no additional imports required.\n\n### Step 6: Comment markers for coordination\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: Ensure the inserted block includes the exact header comment for clarity:\n- `# Convert to NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature)` right before the new conversion block.\n\n### Step 7: Backward compatibility check (documentation note, no code change)\n- Behavior remains unchanged for Image() instances without `as_array=True`.\n- Arrow storage and dtype remain identical; only the decoded return type is optionally np.ndarray when `as_array=True`.\n\n### Step 8: Minimal sanity test (manual, not part of repo code)\n- After implementation, locally verify:\n  - Image(as_array=False): returns PIL.Image.Image, unchanged.\n  - Image(as_array=True): returns np.ndarray dtype float32; for uint8 JPEG, values close to [0,1] with max \u22481.0, min \u22650.0.\n  - With mode=\"L\" and as_array=True: output is HxW float32 in [0,1].\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 1 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature2\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:33:12.127056\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Vision models often require square inputs, but images in datasets have varied aspect ratios. Users currently perform custom preprocessing to center-crop images to squares outside of datasets.\n- Goal: Add an optional boolean flag to the Image feature that, when decoding, center-crops images to a square using the shorter side before any mode conversion occurs.\n- Requirements:\n  - New flag name: crop_to_square: bool = False\n  - Apply crop during decode_example(), before mode conversion\n  - Default behavior unchanged when crop_to_square is False\n  - Ensure automatic serialization and deserialization of the flag within the features system\n  - Coordinate with another agent who adds as_array flag and array conversion at the end of decode\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- The Image feature is a dataclass serialized via Features.to_dict() (asdict) and reconstructed via features.generate_from_dict(). Adding a new dataclass field automatically participates in serialization/deserialization; no explicit to_dict/from_dict methods are present on Image.\n- Crop implementation will be inline using PIL.Image.crop, after image.load() and before any mode conversion.\n- Maintain current behavior for all other code paths. No changes to encode_example, cast_storage, embed_storage, etc.\n- The other agent will append an as_array flag and late-stage conversion to NumPy float32 array in [0,1]. We\u2019ll leave a clearly commented section sequencing to avoid conflicts.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square field to Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 84-87 (immediately after `decode: bool = True` and before `id`)\nAction: Insert new dataclass field\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Field order coordination: Other agent will add `as_array: bool = False` after `crop_to_square` and before `id` (or after id if they prefer end-of-args), but per our agreement, suggested final order is: mode, decode, crop_to_square, as_array, id.\n- No additional imports required.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring to document crop_to_square\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Docstring Args section around lines 62-69\nAction: Edit docstring to add parameter description\nBefore Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            If `True`, center-crop the decoded image to a square using the shorter side before any mode conversion.\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep existing formatting and indentation in the docstring.\n\n### Step 3: Apply center-crop to square during decode_example before mode conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: After `image.load()` (current line ~189) and before the mode conversion `if self.mode ...` block\nAction: Insert crop logic block\nBefore Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n\n        # Center-crop to square (crop_to_square feature)\n        if getattr(self, \"crop_to_square\", False):\n            w, h = image.size\n            if w != h:\n                side = w if w < h else h\n                left = (w - side) // 2\n                top = (h - side) // 2\n                image = image.crop((left, top, left + side, top + side))\n\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- The crop operation happens before mode conversion as agreed.\n- We used integer division to ensure pixel indices are integers; for odd differences, the crop is centered with a one-pixel bias acceptable by design.\n- No change to behavior if `crop_to_square` is False.\n\n### Step 4: Serialization/deserialization note (no code change)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py` and `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nAction: None (document behavior)\nDetails:\n- Because Image is a dataclass, Features.to_dict() uses asdict and features.generate_from_dict() reconstructs via dataclass field names. The new `crop_to_square` field is automatically serialized and deserialized; no explicit to_dict/from_dict additions are required.\n\n### Step 5: Preserve other behavior and avoid touching encoding paths\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nAction: None\nDetails:\n- encode_example, cast_storage, embed_storage, and helpers remain unchanged.\n- This feature only affects decode-time behavior.\n\n### Step 6: Coordination placeholder for other agent (no code change by me)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Same decode_example section\nAction: Reserve placement order and comments for the other agent\nDetails:\n- The other agent will add after the mode conversion and before the final `return` a block marked:\n  `# Convert to NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature)`\n- They will return the NumPy array if `as_array` is True; otherwise, the function continues to return the PIL.Image.Image.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- Ownership:\n  - I own: crop_to_square field, docstring update, and center-crop logic insertion in decode_example\n  - Other agent owns: as_array field and the final-stage array conversion inside decode_example\n- Field order: I add `crop_to_square` right after `decode`. Other agent adds `as_array` immediately after `crop_to_square`. Suggested final order: mode, decode, crop_to_square, as_array, id.\n- Line placement in decode_example:\n  - My crop block is inserted right after `image.load()` and before any mode conversion, commented as `# Center-crop to square (crop_to_square feature)`.\n  - Their conversion block goes after mode conversion and before the `return image`, commented as `# Convert to NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature)`.\n- Dependency order: My crop runs before any PIL mode conversion and definitely before their NumPy conversion. They should not alter earlier logic to preserve this order.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n# Implementation Plan 2 for huggingface_datasets_task_task6252_feature5\n\n**Model**: gpt-5\n**Generated**: 2025-09-07T12:33:12.127439\n\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n- Problem: Downstream NumPy pipelines often require normalized float arrays, but Image currently returns PIL.Image only, forcing extra conversions.\n- Goal: Add a flag `as_array` to Image so that decoded images can be returned as NumPy arrays with dtype float32 scaled to [0, 1].\n- Requirements:\n  - New dataclass field: `as_array: bool = False` on Image.\n  - Serialization: rely on existing Features.asdict()/from_dict() so `as_array` is persisted when True, and omitted when False (default).\n  - Decoding: At the very end of decode_example(), after all PIL operations (including any cropping and mode conversions), if `as_array=True`, return a NumPy float32 array in [0,1] instead of a PIL.Image.\n  - Backward compatibility: When `as_array=False`, behavior remains unchanged. No change to Arrow storage.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- File impacted: src/datasets/features/image.py only.\n- Field order coordination (shared with other agent): mode, decode, crop_to_square (theirs), as_array (mine), id.\n  - Other agent adds `crop_to_square: bool = False` after `decode` and before `id`.\n  - I insert `as_array: bool = False` immediately before the `id` field (i.e., after their `crop_to_square`) to avoid conflicts and match the agreed order.\n- Serialization: Features.to_dict() uses datasets.utils.py_utils.asdict which only serializes dataclass fields if they differ from default (or have special metadata). This is acceptable: if `as_array=True` it will be serialized, else omitted and default to False at load time.\n- decode_example flow ordering (agreed):\n  1) Load/ensure PIL.Image\n  2) Other agent: optional center-crop to square (crop_to_square feature)\n  3) Existing mode conversion (if self.mode)\n  4) My conversion: optional NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature), then return\n  5) Otherwise return PIL.Image\n- Normalization logic:\n  - If image array dtype is integer: divide by max value for that dtype (e.g., 255 for uint8, 65535 for uint16), cast to float32.\n  - If dtype is float: clip to [0,1], cast to float32.\n  - If dtype is boolean: cast to float32 (values 0 or 1 already comply).\n- Return type annotation of decode_example updated to Union[PIL.Image.Image, np.ndarray] for clarity (no runtime impact).\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- The other agent owns and implements:\n  - New field: `crop_to_square: bool = False` positioned after `decode` and before `id`.\n  - decode_example() center-crop block placed between `image.load()` and the existing mode conversion, with header comment: `# Center-crop to square (crop_to_square feature)`.\n- I own and implement:\n  - New field: `as_array: bool = False` positioned after their `crop_to_square` and before `id`.\n  - decode_example() array conversion block placed after the mode conversion and before the return, with header comment: `# Convert to NumPy float32 array in [0,1] (as_array feature)`.\n- Dependency order:\n  - Their crop_to_square code lands first.\n  - My as_array conversion must be applied after any PIL-based operations and after mode conversion.\n- No helper functions added by either party; no changes to Arrow pa_type.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Add `as_array` field to Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Immediately before the existing `id: Optional[str] = None` line (currently line 86).
