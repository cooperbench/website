Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Downstream users often want image pixels as normalized NumPy arrays without extra conversion steps from PIL, which adds overhead and inconsistency.\nGoal: Add an option that returns decoded images as float32 NumPy arrays scaled to [0, 1] directly from the Image feature.\nRequirements:\n- Introduce a new Image dataclass flag `as_array: bool = False`.\n- If `as_array=True`, `decode_example` should return a NumPy array (dtype float32) with values in [0, 1].\n- Maintain backward compatibility and avoid modifying Arrow storage or other modules.\n- Coordinate with other agents editing the same file to prevent conflicts.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared file `src/datasets/features/image.py` with Agents 1 and 3.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: Adds `max_resolution` field, docs, and thumbnail clamp in `decode_example` after mode conversion.\n- Agent 3: CMYK auto-convert logic right after `image.load()` and a Note in the docstring.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Field order in dataclass: mode, decode, max_resolution (Agent 1), as_array (mine), id.\n- Docstring Args order: I\u2019ll add `as_array` right after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` entry; Agent 3 adds a Note paragraph after Args and before Examples.\n- decode_example ordering: load -> Agent 3 CMYK block -> optional self.mode convert -> Agent 1 thumbnail clamp -> my `as_array` conversion and early return -> final `return image`.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: Extend the existing Image feature with a new flag and post-decode processing path. No changes to Arrow schema (`pa_type`) or storage encoding. Reuse existing NumPy import. No additional external dependencies.\nCritical Notes:\n- Do not touch Pillow import logic; rely on existing config.PIL_AVAILABLE gates.\n- Normalization details:\n  - For integer arrays: convert to float32 and divide by the dtype max using `np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max`.\n  - For float arrays: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1].\n- Keep indentation consistent (4 spaces). No new top-level imports needed.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add `as_array` dataclass field\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared \u2014 I add my field after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` and before `id`.\nLocation: Around line 86-90, directly above the existing `id` field.\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n    as_array: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve field order and defaults exactly.\n- No other class variables or methods are modified in this step.\n\n### Step 2: Document `as_array` in the class docstring Args\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared \u2014 I add only my arg entry after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` entry; Agent 3 will add a separate Note paragraph after Args.\nLocation: In the Image class docstring Args block (currently near lines 62-71). Insert after the `max_resolution` arg docs and before Examples.\nAction: Add\nAfter Code (to insert as a new paragraph under Args):\n```\n        as_array (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):\n            If `True`, decoded images are returned as a NumPy `ndarray` of `dtype=float32` with pixel values scaled to\n            the range [0, 1]. If `False`, a `PIL.Image.Image` is returned.\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Indentation must match other Args entries (8 spaces before text to align inside docstring).\n- Do not modify other sections (Examples, Returns) to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Step 3: Add `as_array` normalization/return logic in `decode_example`\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared \u2014 I add logic immediately before the final `return image`, after Agent 1\u2019s thumbnail clamp.\nLocation: Inside `Image.decode_example`, just before the last `return image` (currently around line 191).\nAction: Add\nBefore Code (tail of the function as it stands prior to my change; new blocks by other agents will appear above, but the final return remains):\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        # --- Agent 1 inserts optional thumbnail clamp above this return ---\n        # Normalize to float32 NumPy array in [0, 1] if requested\n        if getattr(self, \"as_array\", False):\n            arr = np.asarray(image)\n            if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer):\n                max_val = np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / float(max_val)\n            else:\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n                arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            return arr\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the `getattr(self, \"as_array\", False)` to be resilient to any older pickled objects without the field.\n- No additional imports; use the existing `import numpy as np` at the top of the file.\n- This block must come after Agent 1\u2019s thumbnail clamp to ensure arrays reflect the resized dimensions.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_5 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

If `False`, a `PIL.Image.Image` is returned.\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Indentation must match other Args entries (8 spaces before text to align inside docstring).\n- Do not modify other sections (Examples, Returns) to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Step 3: Add `as_array` normalization/return logic in `decode_example`\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared \u2014 I add logic immediately before the final `return image`, after Agent 1\u2019s thumbnail clamp.\nLocation: Inside `Image.decode_example`, just before the last `return image` (currently around line 191).\nAction: Add\nBefore Code (tail of the function as it stands prior to my change; new blocks by other agents will appear above, but the final return remains):\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        # --- Agent 1 inserts optional thumbnail clamp above this return ---\n        # Normalize to float32 NumPy array in [0, 1] if requested\n        if getattr(self, \"as_array\", False):\n            arr = np.asarray(image)\n            if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer):\n                max_val = np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / float(max_val)\n            else:\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n                arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            return arr\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the `getattr(self, \"as_array\", False)` to be resilient to any older pickled objects without the field.\n- No additional imports; use the existing `import numpy as np` at the top of the file.\n- This block must come after Agent 1\u2019s thumbnail clamp to ensure arrays reflect the resized dimensions.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Downstream users often want image pixels as normalized NumPy arrays without extra conversion steps from PIL, which adds overhead and inconsistency.\nGoal: Add an option that returns decoded images as float32 NumPy arrays scaled to [0, 1] directly from the Image feature.\nRequirements:\n- Introduce a new Image dataclass flag `as_array: bool = False`.\n- If `as_array=True`, `decode_example` should return a NumPy array (dtype float32) with values in [0, 1].\n- Maintain backward compatibility and avoid modifying Arrow storage or other modules.\n- Coordinate with other agents editing the same file to prevent conflicts.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared file `src/datasets/features/image.py` with Agents 1 and 3.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: Adds `max_resolution` field, docs, and thumbnail clamp in `decode_example` after mode conversion.\n- Agent 3: CMYK auto-convert logic right after `image.load()` and a Note in the docstring.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Field order in dataclass: mode, decode, max_resolution (Agent 1), as_array (mine), id.\n- Docstring Args order: I\u2019ll add `as_array` right after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` entry; Agent 3 adds a Note paragraph after Args and before Examples.\n- decode_example ordering: load -> Agent 3 CMYK block -> optional self.mode convert -> Agent 1 thumbnail clamp -> my `as_array` conversion and early return -> final `return image`.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: Extend the existing Image feature with a new flag and post-decode processing path. No changes to Arrow schema (`pa_type`) or storage encoding. Reuse existing NumPy import. No additional external dependencies.\nCritical Notes:\n- Do not touch Pillow import logic; rely on existing config.PIL_AVAILABLE gates.\n- Normalization details:\n  - For integer arrays: convert to float32 and divide by the dtype max using `np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max`.\n  - For float arrays: cast to float32 and clip to [0, 1].\n- Keep indentation consistent (4 spaces). No new top-level imports needed.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add `as_array` dataclass field\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared \u2014 I add my field after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` and before `id`.\nLocation: Around line 86-90, directly above the existing `id` field.\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n    as_array: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Preserve field order and defaults exactly.\n- No other class variables or methods are modified in this step.\n\n### Step 2: Document `as_array` in the class docstring Args\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared \u2014 I add only my arg entry after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` entry; Agent 3 will add a separate Note paragraph after Args.\nLocation: In the Image class docstring Args block (currently near lines 62-71). Insert after the `max_resolution` arg docs and before Examples.\nAction: Add\nAfter Code (to insert as a new paragraph under Args):\n```\n        as_array (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):\n            If `True`, decoded images are returned as a NumPy `ndarray` of `dtype=float32` with pixel values scaled to\n            the range [0, 1]. If `False`, a `PIL.Image.Image` is returned.\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Indentation must match other Args entries (8 spaces before text to align inside docstring).\n- Do not modify other sections (Examples, Returns) to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Step 3: Add `as_array` normalization/return logic in `decode_example`\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared \u2014 I add logic immediately before the final `return image`, after Agent 1\u2019s thumbnail clamp.\nLocation: Inside `Image.decode_example`, just before the last `return image` (currently around line 191).\nAction: Add\nBefore Code (tail of the function as it stands prior to my change; new blocks by other agents will appear above, but the final return remains):\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        # --- Agent 1 inserts optional thumbnail clamp above this return ---\n        # Normalize to float32 NumPy array in [0, 1] if requested\n        if getattr(self, \"as_array\", False):\n            arr = np.asarray(image)\n            if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer):\n                max_val = np.iinfo(arr.dtype).max\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32) / float(max_val)\n            else:\n                arr = arr.astype(np.float32)\n                arr = np.clip(arr, 0.0, 1.0)\n            return arr\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the `getattr(self, \"as_array\", False)` to be resilient to any older pickled objects without the field.\n- No additional imports; use the existing `import numpy as np` at the top of the file.\n- This block must come after Agent 1\u2019s thumbnail clamp to ensure arrays reflect the resized dimensions.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 2, "timestamp": "2026-01-07T21:20:04.255831", "source": "user", "message": "Retrieving content for: You are agent_3 working on the following feature i", "action": "recall", "args": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "query": "You are agent_3 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Optional Image Size Clamping with Max Resolution Threshold\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces an optional `max_resolution` parameter to the `Image` feature, which clamps image dimensions during decoding. If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nHigh-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Decoding very high-resolution images can be memory heavy and slow. Users currently resize images manually after decoding.\nGoal: Add an optional max_resolution parameter to the Image feature to clamp the decoded image size by downscaling proportionally while preserving aspect ratio.\nRequirements:\n- Add a new optional dataclass field max_resolution: Optional[int] = None to Image\n- Document max_resolution in the Image class docstring under Args\n- In decode_example, if max_resolution is set and the image exceeds the limit on either dimension, downscale in-place using Pillow\u2019s thumbnail() to fit within (max_resolution, max_resolution)\n- Maintain backward compatibility and avoid touching other files or schemas\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership:\n- I modify src/datasets/features/image.py only\n- This file is shared with other agents (Agent 2 and Agent 3)\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 2: Add as_array: bool = False field, docstring for as_array, and decode_example conversion to NumPy array after my resize block\n- Agent 3: Add a Note paragraph in the docstring about CMYK auto-conversion and add decode_example logic to auto-convert CMYK to RGB right after image.load() and before mode conversion\nShared File Strategy:\n- Dataclass fields order: mode, decode, max_resolution (mine), as_array (Agent 2), id\n- Docstring Args order: document max_resolution right after decode; Agent 2 documents as_array right after max_resolution; Agent 3 adds a Note paragraph after the Args block and before Examples\n- decode_example order: image.load() -> Agent 3 CMYK auto-convert -> mode convert -> my max_resolution thumbnail clamp -> Agent 2 as_array conversion and early return -> return image\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture:\n- This is a minimal, backward-compatible change within the Image feature\n- New field defaults to None and is not serialized when at default, consistent with current asdict behavior\n- No changes to Arrow storage, schemas, or external APIs beyond the new optional parameter\nCritical Notes:\n- Use Pillow\u2019s thumbnail for proportional downscale; it modifies the image in place\n- Choose resample filter dynamically for Pillow versions: prefer Resampling.LANCZOS; fall back to LANCZOS; then ANTIALIAS\n- Place resize only after potential mode conversion to ensure resizing applies to the final mode\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution dataclass field\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 84-87 (after `decode` and before `id`)\nOwnership: Shared file \u2013 I own this insertion. Agent 2 will later add `as_array` after this new field.\nAction: Modify (insert new field)\nBefore Code:\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     id: Optional[str] = None\n87     # Automatically constructed\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n84     mode: Optional[str] = None\n85     decode: bool = True\n86     max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n87     id: Optional[str] = None\n88     # Automatically constructed\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep indentation and typing consistent\n- Do not add imports; Optional is already imported\n- Agent 2 will insert `as_array: bool = False` after line 86 and before line 87 in their change; final order will be: mode, decode, max_resolution, as_array, id\n\n### Step 2: Document max_resolution in the class docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around the Args section (Lines 62-71)\nOwnership: Shared file \u2013 I own only the max_resolution addition in Args. Agent 2 will add `as_array` lines after mine. Agent 3 will add a Note paragraph after Args and before Examples.\nAction: Modify (insert docstring lines for max_resolution)\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n62     Args:\n63         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n64             The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n65         decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n66             Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n67             returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code (excerpt with insertion following decode):\n```\n62     Args:\n63         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n64             The mode to convert the image to.
