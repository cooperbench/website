Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding.

Users currently must crop images post-decode, adding overhead.\nGoal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to Image that crops a uniform pixel margin from all four edges during decoding.\nRequirements:\n- New dataclass field: crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n- Document the new argument in Image docstring.\n- Apply cropping during decode_example, after optional mode conversion and before any resizing (Agent 1) and CMYK\u2192RGB conversion (Agent 3).\n- Safe on small images (do nothing if margin would remove or invert dimensions).\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership:\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- Agent 1 (max_resolution) owns: typing import Tuple, max_resolution docs, dataclass field, resize block in decode_example.\n- Agent 2 (me, crop_margin) owns: crop_margin docs, dataclass field, crop block in decode_example.\n- Agent 3 (CMYK\u2192RGB) owns: docstring note near Examples and final conversion block before return.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: Will place resize logic after my crop block; adds Tuple import.\n- Agent 3: Will place CMYK\u2192RGB block last, after Agent 1\u2019s resize block.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Append-only docstring edits; maintain ordering: decode docs \u2192 max_resolution docs (Agent 1) \u2192 crop_margin docs (mine) \u2192 Note (Agent 3) \u2192 Examples.\n- Dataclass field order: mode, decode, max_resolution (Agent 1), crop_margin (mine), id, dtype\u2026\n- decode_example ordering: mode convert \u2192 crop_margin block (mine) \u2192 max_resolution resize block (Agent 1) \u2192 CMYK\u2192RGB block (Agent 3) \u2192 return.\n- I will add placeholder comments in decode_example to anchor Agent 1 and Agent 3 insertions.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture:\n- Image is a dataclass; features are decoded via decode_example.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Optional Image Border Cropping Support\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature, allowing users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding. This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Some datasets contain consistent edge artifacts (watermarks/borders). Users currently must crop images post-decode, adding overhead.\nGoal: Add an optional crop_margin parameter to Image that crops a uniform pixel margin from all four edges during decoding.\nRequirements:\n- New dataclass field: crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n- Document the new argument in Image docstring.\n- Apply cropping during decode_example, after optional mode conversion and before any resizing (Agent 1) and CMYK\u2192RGB conversion (Agent 3).\n- Safe on small images (do nothing if margin would remove or invert dimensions).\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership:\n- Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- Agent 1 (max_resolution) owns: typing import Tuple, max_resolution docs, dataclass field, resize block in decode_example.\n- Agent 2 (me, crop_margin) owns: crop_margin docs, dataclass field, crop block in decode_example.\n- Agent 3 (CMYK\u2192RGB) owns: docstring note near Examples and final conversion block before return.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 1: Will place resize logic after my crop block; adds Tuple import.\n- Agent 3: Will place CMYK\u2192RGB block last, after Agent 1\u2019s resize block.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Append-only docstring edits; maintain ordering: decode docs \u2192 max_resolution docs (Agent 1) \u2192 crop_margin docs (mine) \u2192 Note (Agent 3) \u2192 Examples.\n- Dataclass field order: mode, decode, max_resolution (Agent 1), crop_margin (mine), id, dtype\u2026\n- decode_example ordering: mode convert \u2192 crop_margin block (mine) \u2192 max_resolution resize block (Agent 1) \u2192 CMYK\u2192RGB block (Agent 3) \u2192 return.\n- I will add placeholder comments in decode_example to anchor Agent 1 and Agent 3 insertions.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture:\n- Image is a dataclass; features are decoded via decode_example. We inject a crop step that uses Pillow\u2019s crop: image.crop((left, top, right, bottom)).\n- Effective margin eff = min(crop_margin, (width-1)//2, (height-1)//2) to prevent empty/negative dims; do nothing if eff <= 0.\nCritical Notes:\n- Leave imports untouched (Agent 1 adds Tuple; my feature needs no new imports).\n- Keep indentation consistent with surrounding code (4 spaces).\n- Place placeholders:\n  - # [max_resolution resize block goes here]\n  - # [CMYK->RGB auto-conversion block goes here]\n- Ensure crop executes only when crop_margin is set to a positive int.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Extend Image docstring with crop_margin argument\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 69 (immediately before the \"Examples:\" section). This insertion must come after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` docs in the Args block.\nAction: Add\nBefore Code (existing context lines 62-71):\n\"\"\"\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n\n    Examples:\n\"\"\"\nAfter Code (insert these lines just above \"Examples:\"):\n\"\"\"\n        crop_margin (`int`, *optional*):\n            Number of pixels to crop uniformly from all four edges during decoding.\n            Cropping is applied before resizing when used together with `max_resolution`.\n\"\"\"\nCritical Details:\n- Maintain the same indentation level as existing arg docs (8 spaces before content lines inside the docstring).\n- Ensure a blank line separates the end of Args from the \"Examples:\" header.\n\n### Step 2: Add dataclass field for crop_margin\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around lines 84-91, directly after Agent 1\u2019s `max_resolution` field and before `id`.\nAction: Insert a new field line\nBefore Code (current block):\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\nAfter Code (the block should look like this after Agent 1\u2019s field and my field are added):\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]] = None  # [Agent 1 inserts]\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\nCritical Details:\n- Do not reorder or remove existing fields beyond inserting crop_margin in the agreed position.\n- No new imports needed for this step.\n\n### Step 3: Crop during decode, and add placeholders for other agents\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 188-191 (end of `decode_example`): insert after the optional mode conversion and before `return image`.\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code (lines 188-191):\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\nAfter Code (replace the return with the following block including placeholders):\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # [crop_margin block begins]\n        # Crop a uniform margin from all sides if requested\n        if getattr(self, \"crop_margin\", None):\n            width, height = image.size\n            m = int(self.crop_margin or 0)\n            # Ensure we don't crop past the center; keep at least 1px in each dimension\n            eff = min(m, (width - 1) // 2, (height - 1) // 2)\n            if eff > 0:\n                image = image.crop((eff, eff, width - eff, height - eff))\n        # [crop_margin block ends]\n\n        # [max_resolution resize block goes here]\n        # [CMYK->RGB auto-conversion block goes here]\n\n        return image\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the order: crop first \u2192 resize (Agent 1) \u2192 CMYK\u2192RGB (Agent 3).\n- Use getattr(self, \"crop_margin\", None) to be robust if older serialized schemas are loaded.\n- The placeholders are required anchors for Agents 1 and 3 to append their blocks without conflicts.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "action": "system", "args": {"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nHigh-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can bloat memory and slow preprocessing; users currently must resize post-decode.\nGoal: Add an optional max_resolution parameter to Image that clamps image size during decode, preserving aspect ratio.\nRequirements:\n- New parameter on Image: max_resolution (int or Tuple[int, int])\n- On decode_example, if set and image exceeds either bound, downscale using Pillow\u2019s thumbnail() with LANCZOS\n- Maintain aspect ratio; only downscale when needed\n- Remain backwards-compatible; default behavior unchanged when None\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership:\n- I own edits in src/datasets/features/image.py limited to: typing import update, Image docstring arg block for max_resolution, Image dataclass field insertion, and resize block in decode_example.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 2: crop_margin parameter (docs, field, and a crop block in decode_example). Their crop block runs before my resize block.\n- Agent 3: Automatic CMYK\u2192RGB conversion note + a decode_example block at the very end. Their conversion runs after my resize block.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Imports: I add Tuple; others won\u2019t touch imports.\n- Docstring: I insert max_resolution docs right after decode arg docs. Agent 2 inserts crop_margin docs immediately after mine. Agent 3 appends a Note before Examples. All are append-only.\n- Dataclass: I add max_resolution immediately after decode field. Agent 2 adds crop_margin immediately after my field. Append-only ordering to avoid conflicts.\n- decode_example ordering: existing mode conversion -> [Agent 2 crop block] -> [my resize block] -> [Agent 3 CMYK\u2192RGB block] -> return. I will place explicit placeholder comments for Agent 2 and Agent 3 so they can target insertions without overlap.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture:\n- Image decodes with PIL.Image.open; we hook into decode_example after load() and optional mode conversion.\n- Use Pillow\u2019s thumbnail() to compute proportional downscale within (max_w, max_h). Choose resample as PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS when available, else PIL.Image.LANCZOS, else PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS.\nCritical Notes:\n- Only apply thumbnail if image.width > max_w or image.height > max_h.\n- Accept int or Tuple[int, int]; coerce to ints and guard against non-positive values.\n- Leave explicit placeholder comments in decode_example for other agents\u2019 blocks.\n- Keep indentation and spacing consistent with existing code; don\u2019t modify unrelated logic.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add Tuple to typing imports\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 6\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\nAfter Code:\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union, Tuple\nCritical Details: Keep ordering and single-line import style consistent with the file; do not rearrange other imports.\n\n### Step 2: Extend Image docstring with max_resolution arg\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared (my block inserted first; Agent 2 and 3 will append after)\nLocation: Around lines 62-68 inside the Image class docstring Args section, immediately after the `decode` arg docs and before Examples\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n        Args:\n            mode (`str`, *optional*):\n                The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n                Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n                returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\\\"path\\\": image_path, \\\"bytes\\\": image_bytes}`.\nAfter Code:\n        Args:\n            mode (`str`, *optional*):\n                The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n                Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n                returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\\\"path\\\": image_path, \\\"bytes\\\": image_bytes}`.\n            max_resolution (`int` or `Tuple[int, int]`, *optional*):\n                If set, images larger than this resolution are downscaled proportionally during decoding to fit\n                within the specified bounds while maintaining aspect ratio.

If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nHigh-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can bloat memory and slow preprocessing; users currently must resize post-decode.\nGoal: Add an optional max_resolution parameter to Image that clamps image size during decode, preserving aspect ratio.\nRequirements:\n- New parameter on Image: max_resolution (int or Tuple[int, int])\n- On decode_example, if set and image exceeds either bound, downscale using Pillow\u2019s thumbnail() with LANCZOS\n- Maintain aspect ratio; only downscale when needed\n- Remain backwards-compatible; default behavior unchanged when None\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership:\n- I own edits in src/datasets/features/image.py limited to: typing import update, Image docstring arg block for max_resolution, Image dataclass field insertion, and resize block in decode_example.\nOther Agent Handles:\n- Agent 2: crop_margin parameter (docs, field, and a crop block in decode_example). Their crop block runs before my resize block.\n- Agent 3: Automatic CMYK\u2192RGB conversion note + a decode_example block at the very end. Their conversion runs after my resize block.\nShared File Strategy:\n- Imports: I add Tuple; others won\u2019t touch imports.\n- Docstring: I insert max_resolution docs right after decode arg docs. Agent 2 inserts crop_margin docs immediately after mine. Agent 3 appends a Note before Examples. All are append-only.\n- Dataclass: I add max_resolution immediately after decode field. Agent 2 adds crop_margin immediately after my field. Append-only ordering to avoid conflicts.\n- decode_example ordering: existing mode conversion -> [Agent 2 crop block] -> [my resize block] -> [Agent 3 CMYK\u2192RGB block] -> return. I will place explicit placeholder comments for Agent 2 and Agent 3 so they can target insertions without overlap.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture:\n- Image decodes with PIL.Image.open; we hook into decode_example after load() and optional mode conversion.\n- Use Pillow\u2019s thumbnail() to compute proportional downscale within (max_w, max_h). Choose resample as PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS when available, else PIL.Image.LANCZOS, else PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS.\nCritical Notes:\n- Only apply thumbnail if image.width > max_w or image.height > max_h.\n- Accept int or Tuple[int, int]; coerce to ints and guard against non-positive values.\n- Leave explicit placeholder comments in decode_example for other agents\u2019 blocks.\n- Keep indentation and spacing consistent with existing code; don\u2019t modify unrelated logic.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add Tuple to typing imports\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 6\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\nAfter Code:\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union, Tuple\nCritical Details: Keep ordering and single-line import style consistent with the file; do not rearrange other imports.\n\n### Step 2: Extend Image docstring with max_resolution arg\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared (my block inserted first; Agent 2 and 3 will append after)\nLocation: Around lines 62-68 inside the Image class docstring Args section, immediately after the `decode` arg docs and before Examples\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code:\n        Args:\n            mode (`str`, *optional*):\n                The mode to convert the image to.

This explains that cropping removes a uniform number of pixels from all edges and occurs before resizing.\n\n2) Dataclass field\n- Added crop_margin: Optional[int] = None adjacent to id and after decode, ensuring compatibility with the agreed ordering relative to max_resolution. I did not alter the other agent\u2019s max_resolution line.\n\n3) Decoding behavior\n- In decode_example, added a safe crop step right after optional mode conversion and before any downstream resizing or CMYK\u2192RGB conversions. The logic crops by an effective margin eff = min(m, (w-1)//2, (h-1)//2); if eff <= 0 then no crop occurs. This preserves image validity and center framing.\n- Left the final return in place and made no changes to imports or other unrelated code.\n\nCoordination and non-overlap\n- Communicated exact line ranges before each change, and ensured no overlapping lines with the other agents\u2019 planned modifications.
