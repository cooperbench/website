Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The bash command to execute.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

My change does not depend on image size.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Modify decode_example to auto-convert CMYK to RGB when no explicit mode is requested\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around lines 186-191 inside Image.decode_example (after `image.load()` and before `if self.mode ...`).\nAction: Insert a new block.\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n\n        # BEGIN datasets: auto-convert CMYK to RGB\n        # Convert CMYK images to RGB only when no explicit output mode was requested,\n        # to improve compatibility with downstream tools/models expecting RGB.\n        if image.mode == \"CMYK\" and self.mode is None:\n            image = image.convert(\"RGB\")\n        # END datasets: auto-convert CMYK to RGB\n\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep this block strictly between `image.load()` and the existing `self.mode` conversion.\n- Do not alter any other logic in the function.\n- The other agent will place their optional downscale block immediately after `image.load()` and before this block.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring to note automatic CMYK->RGB conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 62-68 inside the Image class docstring (Args section under `mode`).\nAction: Modify the docstring text to include the behavior.\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format {\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            Note: When `mode` is `None` and the input image is in CMYK, it is automatically converted to RGB\n            during decoding to improve compatibility with tools and models expecting RGB.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format {\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}.\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep the rest of the docstring unchanged.\n- Do not add new parameters or change behavior beyond the documented note.\n\n### Step 3: No changes to imports, serialization, or other files\nFile: N/A\nAction: None\nCritical Details:\n- This feature is fully contained to the decode path and documentation. No to_dict/from_dict updates are needed.\n- Ensure no conflict with the other agent\u2019s new parameter handling.\n\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

Lines/regions owned:\n    - Line 6 import augmentation\n    - Docstring Args augmentation at Lines 62-69\n    - Dataclass field insertion around Lines 84-91 (specifically after decode field)\n    - New __post_init__ method after Line 92\n    - Clamping block inserted after Line 188 in decode_example\n  - Other agent owns: `src/datasets/features/image.py` CMYK->RGB conversion block and its docstring note.\n    - Placement: Between my clamping block and the existing user-specified mode conversion in decode_example (see sentinel comments in Step 5)\n    - Docstring: Append their note after my max_resolution documentation in the Image class docstring.\n- Line positioning:\n  - My clamping block goes immediately after `image.load()` (current Line 188) and before any mode conversions.\n  - Other agent\u2019s CMYK->RGB block must be placed after my clamping block and before `if self.mode ...` conversion.\n- Dependency order:\n  - My clamping has no dependency on other changes; it can be committed first.\n  - Other agent does not depend on pre-clamped size, so order is satisfied. If they need original size later, they will move their logic before clamping and we will adjust accordingly.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

Preserve explicit user requests via the `mode` parameter.\n- Requirements:\n  - Detect CMYK images during decode and convert to RGB when no explicit `mode` is requested.\n  - Respect user-specified `mode` conversions (e.g., \"L\", \"RGBA\", or even \"CMYK\").\n  - Keep changes minimal and localized to avoid conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Feature location: src/datasets/features/image.py, within Image.decode_example.\n- Insert conversion block after image is loaded (image.load()) and before the existing user-specified mode conversion.\n- Order relative to the other agent\u2019s feature (max_resolution clamp):\n  1) image.load()\n  2) [OTHER AGENT] optional downscale block\n  3) [THIS FEATURE] CMYK->RGB auto-conversion (only if self.mode is None)\n  4) existing user-specified conversion via `self.mode` (if provided)\n- Sentinel comments will be added only around this feature\u2019s block for clarity. The other agent will place their block above ours to maintain the agreed order.\n- No new imports are necessary; PIL is imported inside decode_example guarded by config.PIL_AVAILABLE.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership:\n  - Shared file: src/datasets/features/image.py\n  - Other agent owns: constructor parameter additions/validation/serialization for max_resolution, repr/eq/hash updates, and the downscaling block in decode flow.\n  - I own: the CMYK->RGB auto-conversion block in decode flow, and a minimal docstring update to document the behavior.\n- Line positioning:\n  - Other agent will insert their max_resolution clamp block immediately after image.load().\n  - I will insert my CMYK->RGB block right after their block and before the existing user-specified mode conversion.\n- Dependency order:\n  - Other agent\u2019s downscaling runs before my color-space conversion. My change does not depend on image size.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Modify decode_example to auto-convert CMYK to RGB when no explicit mode is requested\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around lines 186-191 inside Image.decode_example (after `image.load()` and before `if self.mode ...`).\nAction: Insert a new block.\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n\n        # BEGIN datasets: auto-convert CMYK to RGB\n        # Convert CMYK images to RGB only when no explicit output mode was requested,\n        # to improve compatibility with downstream tools/models expecting RGB.\n        if image.mode == \"CMYK\" and self.mode is None:\n            image = image.convert(\"RGB\")\n        # END datasets: auto-convert CMYK to RGB\n\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details:\n- Keep this block strictly between `image.load()` and the existing `self.mode` conversion.\n- Do not alter any other logic in the function.\n- The other agent will place their optional downscale block immediately after `image.load()` and before this block.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring to note automatic CMYK->RGB conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 62-68 inside the Image class docstring (Args section under `mode`).\nAction: Modify the docstring text to include the behavior.\nBefore Code (excerpt):\n```\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`.

Users must manually resize after decoding.\n- Goal: Add an optional max_resolution parameter to Image that clamps decoded image dimensions. If width or height exceeds the threshold, downscale proportionally with Pillow.thumbnail() while keeping aspect ratio.\n- Requirements:\n  - Non-breaking default behavior (max_resolution=None)\n  - Validate input (int > 0 or 2-tuple/list of positive ints)\n  - Apply clamping immediately after image is loaded, before any color/mode conversions\n  - Serialize/deserialize via existing dataclass machinery\n  - Minimal, well-isolated changes with clear sentinel comments\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Image is a @dataclass and participates in automatic to_dict/from_dict via Features.asdict/generate_from_dict. Adding a dataclass field is sufficient for serialization. A __post_init__ will normalize/validate the parameter.\n- The decode_example flow is:\n  1) open image (local/remote/bytes)\n  2) image.load()\n  3) optional user-requested mode conversion\n  4) return image\n- New flow with both features coordinated:\n  1) open image\n  2) image.load()\n  3) [NEW] max_resolution clamping via thumbnail()\n  4) [OTHER AGENT] CMYK->RGB auto-conversion when self.mode is None or \"RGB\"\n  5) existing user-specified mode conversion (if self.mode is set and differs)\n- Pillow compatibility: Resampling enum may differ by version.

No return value.\n- Keeps feature backward-compatible when unset (None).\n\n### Step 5: Insert clamping logic in decode_example immediately after image.load()\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: After current Line 188 (right after `image.load()`), before existing mode conversion block at Lines 189-190\nAction: Insert\nBefore Code (excerpt around the insertion point):\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\nAfter Code (replace the above excerpt with the following, preserving unmodified lines):\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n\n        # BEGIN datasets: max_resolution clamp\n        max_res = getattr(self, \"max_resolution\", None)\n        if max_res is not None:\n            if isinstance(max_res, int):\n                max_w, max_h = max_res, max_res\n            else:\n                try:\n                    max_w, max_h = max_res\n                except Exception:\n                    max_w, max_h = None, None\n            if (\n                isinstance(max_w, int)\n                and isinstance(max_h, int)\n                and (image.width > max_w or image.height > max_h)\n            ):\n                try:\n                    # Prefer Pillow >=9.1 enum, fallback to legacy constants\n                    resampling = getattr(PIL.Image, \"Resampling\", None)\n                    if resampling is not None:\n                        resample_filter = getattr(resampling, \"LANCZOS\", getattr(resampling, \"BICUBIC\", None))\n                    else:\n                        resample_filter = getattr(PIL.Image, \"LANCZOS\", getattr(PIL.Image, \"BICUBIC\", None))\n                    if resample_filter is not None:\n                        image.thumbnail((max_w, max_h), resample=resample_filter)\n                    else:\n                        image.thumbnail((max_w, max_h))\n                except Exception:\n                    # Safety net: default behavior\n                    image.thumbnail((max_w, max_h))\n        # END datasets: max_resolution clamp\n\n        # BEGIN datasets: auto-convert CMYK to RGB (reserved for other agent)\n        # The other agent will insert their CMYK->RGB block here, before user-requested conversions.\n        # END datasets: auto-convert CMYK to RGB\n\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\nCritical Details:\n- Sentinel comments clearly demarcate new blocks for both features.\n- Clamping only occurs if dimensions exceed thresholds; preserves aspect ratio via thumbnail().\n- No change to user-specified mode conversion block and its behavior.\n\n### Step 6: No changes needed to serialization helpers\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: N/A\nAction: None\nRationale: Dataclass asdict/construct via Features handles `max_resolution` automatically. __repr__/eq/hash will include the new field by default; no overrides required.\n\n### Step 7: Minimal docstring alignment (for other agent\u2019s note)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Immediately following the newly added max_resolution docs in the Image class docstring\nAction: Coordination note for the other agent to append their docstring line noting CMYK->RGB auto-conversion when mode is None.\nCritical Details: Other agent will add:\n- A docstring note that when `mode` is None, CMYK images are automatically converted to RGB during decoding.\n\n### Step 8: Sanity check and backwards compatibility\n- Default `max_resolution=None` yields no behavior change.\n- No external imports added at module scope; Pillow used only inside methods where already imported.\n- Works with both local and remote image sources.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- File ownership:\n  - I own: `src/datasets/features/image.py` additions for max_resolution (imports, docstring arg, dataclass field, __post_init__, and the clamping block in decode_example). Lines/regions owned:\n    - Line 6 import augmentation\n    - Docstring Args augmentation at Lines 62-69\n    - Dataclass field insertion around Lines 84-91 (specifically after decode field)\n    - New __post_init__ method after Line 92\n    - Clamping block inserted after Line 188 in decode_example\n  - Other agent owns: `src/datasets/features/image.py` CMYK->RGB conversion block and its docstring note.\n    - Placement: Between my clamping block and the existing user-specified mode conversion in decode_example (see sentinel comments in Step 5)\n    - Docstring: Append their note after my max_resolution documentation in the Image class docstring.\n- Line positioning:\n  - My clamping block goes immediately after `image.load()` (current Line 188) and before any mode conversions.\n  - Other agent\u2019s CMYK->RGB block must be placed after my clamping block and before `if self.mode ...` conversion.\n- Dependency order:\n  - My clamping has no dependency on other changes; it can be committed first.\n  - Other agent does not depend on pre-clamped size, so order is satisfied. If they need original size later, they will move their logic before clamping and we will adjust accordingly.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

Expected change: append `, Tuple`.\n\n2) Docstring: Augment Args section to include `max_resolution` parameter description. I will insert the new block immediately after the existing `decode` arg description and before any following args. Agent_6 noted they inserted a CMYK note after line 64. I will avoid touching that and add my block after the decode arg lines; I will confirm exact line numbers after viewing file.\n\n3) Dataclass field: Insert `max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int], List[int]]] = None` between `decode: bool = True` and `id: Optional[str] = None`. I will report precise lines after viewing.\n\n4) __post_init__: Add a new method `__post_init__` to normalize/validate `max_resolution`. I will place it near other init-time logic\u2014if a __post_init__ already exists, I will integrate; otherwise, I\u2019ll insert the new method after the field definitions and before other methods. I will specify exact lines after viewing.\n\n5) decode_example clamping: Insert the downscale block immediately after `image.load()` and before Agent_6\u2019s CMYK->RGB block. Based on Agent_6, `image.load()` is at line 191 and their block starts at 192.

feature):\n\nI have completed my edits to src/datasets/features/image.py with the following exact changes and current line ranges:\n\n1) Docstring (Args > mode):\n- INSERTED 2 lines AFTER line 64 (current file) documenting automatic CMYK->RGB when mode=None.\n- Current lines:\n  65: Note: When `mode` is `None` and the input image is in CMYK, it is automatically converted to RGB\n  66: during decoding to improve compatibility with tools and models expecting RGB.\n- Please insert your max_resolution docstring block AFTER line 69 to avoid overlapping the decode arg lines. My lines 65-66 are unaffected by your docstring addition.\n\n2) decode_example CMYK->RGB block:\n- REPLACED the old stanza (previously lines 189-191) and placed my block right after image.load().\n- Current anchors:\n  190: image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n  191-196: [MY CMYK->RGB block]\n  198-200: user-specified mode conversion and return\n- To avoid overlap, please INSERT your downscale block AFTER line 190 and BEFORE line 191. Do not modify lines 191-200.\n\nI have not touched imports or dataclass fields. If your earlier changes (typing import and docstring insertion) shift line numbers in your branch, please still anchor your downscale insertion after the exact `image.load()` call and before the `if image.mode == \"CMYK\" ...` block. I will not modify any lines in that region further.\n\nLet me know if you need me to adjust any ranges; otherwise you can proceed safely with:\n- Import line 6 (append Tuple)\n- REPLACE the dataclass field block currently at lines 86-89 with your block that adds max_resolution\n- INSERT __post_init__ AFTER line 95 (immediately after __call__ ends; adjust if your import/doc changes shift lines)\n- INSERT downscale AFTER line 190 (before line 191)\n\nI\u2019ll wait for your confirmation after you complete your edits.", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 57, "timestamp":

to the image file (i.e. random access is allowed).\n    - A `dict` with the keys:\n\n        - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n        - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n      This is useful for archived files with sequential access.\n\n    - An `np.ndarray`: NumPy array representing an image.\n    - A `PIL.Image.Image`: PIL image object.\n\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n            max_resolution (`int` or `tuple[int, int]`, *optional*):\n                If set, clamp the decoded image size by proportionally downscaling when either dimension exceeds the\n                limit. An integer applies to both width and height; a `(max_width, max_height)` tuple sets distinct\n                limits. Downscaling uses Pillow's `thumbnail()` to preserve aspect ratio. Defaults to `None` (no\n                clamping).\n\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>>

to the image file (i.e. random access is allowed).\n    - A `dict` with the keys:\n\n        - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n        - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n      This is useful for archived files with sequential access.\n\n    - An `np.ndarray`: NumPy array representing an image.\n    - A `PIL.Image.Image`: PIL image object.\n\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data.

\"\"\"Image [`Feature`] to read image data from an image file.\n    49\n    50      Input: The Image feature accepts as input:\n    51      - A `str`: Absolute path to the image file (i.e. random

image file.\n    56\n    57        This is useful for archived files with sequential access.\n    58\n    59      - An `np.ndarray`: NumPy array representing an image.\n    60      - A `PIL.Image.Image`: PIL image object.\n    61\n    62      Args:\n    63          mode (`str`, *optional*):\n    64              The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n    65          decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n    66              Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n    67              returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n    68              max_resolution (`int` or `tuple[int, int]`, *optional*):\n    69                  If set, clamp the decoded image size by proportionally downscaling when either dimension exceeds the\n    70                  limit. An integer applies to both width and height; a `(max_width, max_height)` tuple sets distinct\n    71                  limits. Downscaling uses Pillow's `thumbnail()` to preserve aspect ratio.
