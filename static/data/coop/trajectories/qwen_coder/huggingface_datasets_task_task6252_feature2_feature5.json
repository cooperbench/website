Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios that need to be converted to square format for vision models requiring square inputs. Currently, users must implement separate preprocessing logic outside the datasets library.\n\nGoal: Add an optional `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class that enables automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding, before any mode conversion.\n\nRequirements: \n- Add `crop_to_square: bool = False` parameter to Image class\n- When enabled, crop image to centered square using shorter side as reference\n- Apply cropping before mode conversion\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Preserve existing functionality when parameter is False or not provided\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own entirely `src/datasets/features/image.py` \nOther Agent Handles: Based on our conversation, you'll be working on a different feature set\nShared File Strategy: Since I'm only modifying one file, there should be no conflicts\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image class uses dataclass decorator and has a decode_example method that processes image data. The new parameter will be added to the dataclass fields and the decode_example method will be modified to conditionally apply cropping.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to import PIL.Image for cropping operations\n- The crop should happen before mode conversion to maintain consistency\n- Should handle edge cases like already-square images gracefully\n- Follow existing code style and docstring conventions\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Place right after the existing parameters, maintaining alphabetical order where possible\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 62 (in the Args section of docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Many machine learning workflows require image pixel values as NumPy arrays with normalized values in the range [0, 1]. Currently, the Image feature returns PIL.Image objects which require additional conversion steps.\n\nGoal: Add an `as_array` flag to the Image feature that, when enabled, converts decoded images to float32 NumPy arrays scaled to [0, 1] range for direct use in ML pipelines.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PIL Image behavior\n- Support conversion to float32 NumPy arrays with values scaled to [0, 1]\n- Follow existing code patterns and architecture\n- Add appropriate documentation and examples\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I will own entirely `src/datasets/features/image.py` \nOther Agent Handles: Based on the conversation history, the other agent is working on a different feature\nShared File Strategy: Since I'm only modifying one file (`src/datasets/features/image.py`) and the other agent mentioned they're working on a different feature, there should be no conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature uses a dataclass with `decode` parameter and returns PIL images by default. I need to add an `as_array` parameter that controls the output format. When `as_array=True`, images should be converted to NumPy arrays with dtype float32 and normalized to [0, 1].\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to maintain backward compatibility - when `as_array=False` (default), behavior should remain unchanged\n- When `as_array=True`, the output should be a NumPy array with dtype=np.float32\n- Need to handle all input types properly (paths, bytes, dicts, etc.)\n- Must update docstrings and examples appropriately\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array parameter to Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    as_array: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter right after decode to keep related parameters together\n\n### Step 2: Update the docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 62 (in the docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        as_array (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            Whether to return the image data as a NumPy array.

Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_5 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Option to Normalize Image Pixels to Float32 NumPy Array\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces support for normalizing image pixel values by converting them into a `float32` NumPy array scaled to the range [0, 1], controlled by a new `as_array` flag in the `Image` feature. This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Many machine learning workflows require image pixel values as NumPy arrays with normalized values in the range [0, 1]. Currently, the Image feature returns PIL.Image objects which require additional conversion steps.\n\nGoal: Add an `as_array` flag to the Image feature that, when enabled, converts decoded images to float32 NumPy arrays scaled to [0, 1] range for direct use in ML pipelines.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PIL Image behavior\n- Support conversion to float32 NumPy arrays with values scaled to [0, 1]\n- Follow existing code patterns and architecture\n- Add appropriate documentation and examples\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I will own entirely `src/datasets/features/image.py` \nOther Agent Handles: Based on the conversation history, the other agent is working on a different feature\nShared File Strategy: Since I'm only modifying one file (`src/datasets/features/image.py`) and the other agent mentioned they're working on a different feature, there should be no conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature uses a dataclass with `decode` parameter and returns PIL images by default. I need to add an `as_array` parameter that controls the output format. When `as_array=True`, images should be converted to NumPy arrays with dtype float32 and normalized to [0, 1].\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to maintain backward compatibility - when `as_array=False` (default), behavior should remain unchanged\n- When `as_array=True`, the output should be a NumPy array with dtype=np.float32\n- Need to handle all input types properly (paths, bytes, dicts, etc.)\n- Must update docstrings and examples appropriately\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array parameter to Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    as_array: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter right after decode to keep related parameters together\n\n### Step 2: Update the docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 62 (in the docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Option to Normalize Image Pixels to Float32 NumPy Array\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces support for normalizing image pixel values by converting them into a `float32` NumPy array scaled to the range [0, 1], controlled by a new `as_array` flag in the `Image` feature. This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Many machine learning workflows require image pixel values as NumPy arrays with normalized values in the range [0, 1]. Currently, the Image feature returns PIL.Image objects which require additional conversion steps.\n\nGoal: Add an `as_array` flag to the Image feature that, when enabled, converts decoded images to float32 NumPy arrays scaled to [0, 1] range for direct use in ML pipelines.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PIL Image behavior\n- Support conversion to float32 NumPy arrays with values scaled to [0, 1]\n- Follow existing code patterns and architecture\n- Add appropriate documentation and examples\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I will own entirely `src/datasets/features/image.py` \nOther Agent Handles: Based on the conversation history, the other agent is working on a different feature\nShared File Strategy: Since I'm only modifying one file (`src/datasets/features/image.py`) and the other agent mentioned they're working on a different feature, there should be no conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature uses a dataclass with `decode` parameter and returns PIL images by default. I need to add an `as_array` parameter that controls the output format. When `as_array=True`, images should be converted to NumPy arrays with dtype float32 and normalized to [0, 1].\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to maintain backward compatibility - when `as_array=False` (default), behavior should remain unchanged\n- When `as_array=True`, the output should be a NumPy array with dtype=np.float32\n- Need to handle all input types properly (paths, bytes, dicts, etc.)\n- Must update docstrings and examples appropriately\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array parameter to Image dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    as_array: bool = False\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter right after decode to keep related parameters together\n\n### Step 2: Update the docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 62 (in the docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

makes sense since it's designed to decode the data back to a PIL image. However, I need to think about what happens when someone tries to use `as_array=True` with `decode=True`. In that case, they'd expect to get a numpy array, but the decode_example method is hardcoded to return PIL images.\n\nBut looking at the design, I think the intention is that when `as_array=True`, the data should be stored as a numpy array in the Arrow table, and when `decode=True`, the user would get the numpy array directly. However, the current implementation stores the data in the standard format (bytes/path) and the conversion to array happens during encoding.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the approach. Looking at the current implementation, I think I misunderstood how the data flows. The `encode_example` method is responsible for converting inputs to the storage format (which is bytes/path), and then the `decode_example` method converts back to the user-facing format.\n\nBut the problem is that when `as_array=True`, we want the user to get a numpy array directly, not the bytes. This is a bit tricky because the storage format is still bytes/path, but the user-facing format should be different.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Looking at the existing code, I think I should modify the approach to make it work with the existing architecture. The key insight is that I need to make sure that when `as_array=True`, the data is stored in a way that allows it to be retrieved as a numpy array.\n\nBut wait, let me re-read the problem description and the plan.
