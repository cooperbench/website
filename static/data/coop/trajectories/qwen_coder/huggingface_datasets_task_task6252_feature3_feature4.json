Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Users need to remove edge artifacts like watermarks or unwanted framing from images, currently requiring manual post-processing.\nGoal: Add optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature to automatically crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge during decoding.\nRequirements: \n- Add `crop_margin` parameter to Image class constructor\n- Apply cropping using PIL's crop() method during decode_example\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Handle edge cases appropriately\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire src/datasets/features/image.py file for implementing the crop_margin feature\nOther Agent Handles: The max_resolution feature (their separate implementation)\nShared File Strategy: We're both modifying the same file but targeting different parameters/functionalities, so we'll place our changes in different sections of the file\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class already has decode_example method that processes images, so we'll extend this method to handle cropping\nCritical Notes: \n- Crop margin should be an integer specifying pixels to crop from each side (top, bottom, left, right)\n- Need to validate that crop_margin is non-negative\n- Should maintain aspect ratio by cropping from all sides equally\n- PIL's crop method uses (left, upper, right, lower) coordinates\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 84-86 (in the dataclass fields)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add the crop_margin parameter with default None to maintain backward compatibility\n\n### Step 2: Modify decode_example method to handle cropping\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 190 in the decode_example method (after mode conversion)\nAction: Insert cropping logic before returning the image\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply cropping if crop_margin is specified\n        if self.crop_margin is not None:\n            if not isinstance(self.crop_margin, int) or self.crop_margin < 0:\n                raise ValueError(\"crop_margin must be a non-negative integer\")\n            \n            width, height = image.size\n            margin = self.crop_margin\n            \n            # Ensure margin doesn't exceed image dimensions\n            if margin >= width // 2 or margin >= height // 2:\n                raise ValueError(f\"crop_margin ({margin}) is too large for image size ({width}x{height})\")\n            \n            # Crop margins from all sides: (left, upper, right, lower)\n            cropped_image = image.crop((margin, margin, width - margin, height - margin))\n            image = cropped_image\n        \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Check that crop_margin is a non-negative integer\n- Validate that margin isn't larger than half the image dimensions to avoid empty images\n- Use PIL's crop method with coordinates (left, upper, right, lower)\n- Place this logic after mode conversion but before return statement\n- Preserve all existing functionality and error handling\n\n### Step 3: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 62-82 (in the docstring)\nAction: Add documentation for crop_margin parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_margin (`int`, *optional*):\n            The number of pixels to crop from each edge of the image. If `None`, no cropping is applied.\n            The crop is applied symmetrically from all four sides.\n```\nCritical Details: Add clear documentation explaining the parameter behavior and default value\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\nGoal: Introduce an optional `max_resolution` parameter to the `Image` feature that automatically downscales images during decoding to fit within specified width/height limits while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\nRequirements: \n- Add `max_resolution` parameter to Image class constructor\n- Implement automatic downscaling in decode_example method using Pillow's thumbnail() method\n- Maintain backward compatibility \n- Support both integer and tuple inputs for max_resolution\n- Preserve aspect ratio during resizing\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own src/datasets/features/image.py entirely for my implementation\nOther Agent Handles: Adding crop_margin parameter to Image class\nShared File Strategy: We're both modifying the same file but targeting different parameters. I'll add max_resolution parameter near the top of the class definition and implement the logic in decode_example. My changes won't interfere with their crop_margin parameter since we're adding different attributes.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class will accept a new max_resolution parameter that gets stored as an instance variable. In decode_example, I'll check if the image exceeds the max resolution and apply proportional scaling using PIL's thumbnail() method which maintains aspect ratio.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The max_resolution parameter will be optional with default None (no limiting)\n- It can accept either int (for maximum width/height) or tuple (width, height) \n- Uses PIL's thumbnail() method for efficient proportional resizing\n- Maintains backward compatibility by defaulting to no restriction\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing parameters and before the class docstring\n\n### Step 2: Import necessary types for type hints\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 6 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Union\n```\nCritical Details: Added Tuple to the existing import statement\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to implement max_resolution logic\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 190 (before return statement)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply max resolution clamping if specified\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            if isinstance(self.max_resolution, int):\n                max_width = max_height = self.max_resolution\n            else:\n                max_width, max_height = self.max_resolution\n            \n            # Only resize if image exceeds max dimensions\n            if image.width > max_width or image.height > max_height:\n                # Use thumbnail to maintain aspect ratio and perform in-place resizing\n                image.thumbnail((max_width, max_height), PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)\n        \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added after the mode conversion and before returning the image. Used PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS for high-quality downsampling.\n\n### Step 4: Update class docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 62 (in the docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        max_resolution (`int` or `tuple`, *optional*):\n            Maximum width and height (in pixels) of the image. If the image exceeds these dimensions,\n            it will be downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit. If an integer is provided,\n            it will be used for both width and height. If a tuple is provided, it should contain\n            (width, height) values.\n```\nCritical Details: Added documentation for the new parameter in the docstring right after the existing parameters.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nHigh-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines.
