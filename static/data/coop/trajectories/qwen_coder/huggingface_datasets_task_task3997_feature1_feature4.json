Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The enhanced method improves flexibility when working with diverse data types, though it may conflict with the existing decorator-enhanced update method.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `update` method in `Features` only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe method is modified to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates.

The `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` methods properly maintain this synchronization, but the `update` method does not.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The current update method at line 1248 only handles basic iteration over key-value pairs\n- The `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary needs to be updated for each item added/updated\n- Need to ensure the update method works correctly with both dictionary-like iterables and other iterables\n- Must maintain compatibility with existing code that uses the update method\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Understand current update method behavior\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1248-1256\nAction: Analyze existing implementation\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nAfter Code: [Will be replaced with extended version]\n\n### Step 2: Extend update method to support additional data types and batch updates\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1248 (replacing existing method)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        \"\"\"\n        Update the Features dictionary with key-value pairs from iterable and keyword arguments.\n        \n        Supports batch updates from dictionaries, sequences of key-value pairs, and JSON-like structures.\n        Maintains synchronization with the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary.\n        \n        Args:\n            iterable: An iterable of key-value pairs or a dictionary-like object\n            **kwds: Additional key-value pairs to update with\n        \"\"\"\n        #

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Sync Features dictionaries\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis PR introduces a wrapper function for the `Features` class to keep the secondary dictionary, `_column_requires_decoding`, synchronized with the main features dictionary. The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The Features class has a separate dictionary `_column_requires_decoding` to track whether features require decoding, but this dictionary is not kept fully synchronized with the main features dictionary across all operations. The current implementation only handles `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` but not all dictionary operations.\n\nGoal: Implement a decorator-based solution to automatically synchronize `_column_requires_decoding` with the main features dictionary for all dictionary operations to prevent inconsistencies.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Ensure all dictionary operations (setitem, delitem, update, etc.) keep both dictionaries in sync\n- Use decorator approach instead of subclassing to avoid performance issues\n- Follow existing code patterns and style\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire `src/datasets/features/features.py` file for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature involves extending the `update` method in the same file\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate on line numbers and make sure our changes don't overlap in the same method implementations\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution uses a decorator pattern to wrap dictionary operations on the Features class to ensure that any modification to the main dictionary also updates the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. This approach avoids the complexity and performance issues of subclassing UserDict while maintaining all functionality.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The decorator approach will wrap methods like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update`\n- Need to ensure that the decorator is applied correctly to maintain the existing behavior\n- Will need to carefully consider the order of operations to avoid recursion issues\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Define the decorator function for keeping features dictionaries synced\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the existing imports and before the Features class definition (around line 42)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\nfrom .translation import Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom .translation import Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages\n\n\ndef keep_features_dicts_synced(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decorator to ensure that the _column_requires_decoding dictionary stays in sync with the main features dictionary.\n    \n    This decorator should be applied to methods that modify the Features dictionary to ensure that\n    the _column_requires_decoding dictionary is updated accordingly.\n    \"\"\"\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Call the original method\n        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Rebuild _column_requires_decoding from scratch to ensure consistency\n        # This is safer than trying to manually update individual entries\n        self._column_requires_decoding = {col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()}\n        \n        return result\n    return wrapper\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing imports, before class definitions. Used a simple approach of rebuilding the entire `_column_requires_decoding` dict rather than trying to manually manage individual updates to prevent potential issues.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the decorator to __setitem__ method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1240 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __setitem__(self, column_name: str, feature: FeatureType):\n        super().__setitem__(column_name, feature)\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    @keep_features_dicts_synced\n    def __setitem__(self, column_name: str, feature: FeatureType):\n        super().__setitem__(column_name, feature)\n        # Note: _column_requires_decoding will be rebuilt by the decorator\n```\nCritical Details: Applied the decorator to the existing `__setitem__` method. Removed the manual update since the decorator handles it.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the decorator to __delitem__ method  \nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1244 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __delitem__(self, column_name: str):\n        super().__delitem__(column_name)\n        del self._column_requires_decoding[column_name]\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    @keep_features_dicts_synced\n    def __delitem__(self, column_name: str):\n        super().__delitem__(column_name)\n        # Note: _column_requires_decoding will be rebuilt by the decorator\n```\nCritical Details: Applied the decorator to the existing `__delitem__` method. Removed the manual deletion since the decorator handles it.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the decorator to update method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1248 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    @keep_features_dicts_synced\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nCritical Details: Applied the decorator to the existing `update` method. This ensures that when update is called, the synchronization happens automatically.\n\n### Step 5: Update the __init__ method to remove redundant initialization\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1234 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {\n            col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()\n        }\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        # _column_requires_decoding will be initialized by the decorator on first access\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {}\n```\nCritical Details: Simplified the initialization to just create an empty dict, since the decorator approach will handle the proper initialization.\n\n### Step 6: Add missing imports needed for the decorator\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 25 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n\nfrom .features import require_decoding\n```\nCritical Details: Added import for `require_decoding` function which is used in the decorator.\n\n### Step 7: Verify that other methods accessing _column_requires_decoding still work correctly\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 1374 (in the Features class)\nAction: Check\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        return {\n            column_name: decode_nested_example(feature, value)\n            if self._column_requires_decoding[column_name]\n            else value\n            for column_name, (feature, value) in zip_dict(\n                self, example, ordered=True\n            ).items()\n        }\n```\nAfter Code: No change needed, this usage pattern is correct\n\nCritical Details: This usage of `_column_requires_decoding` is fine as it's just reading from the dict, not modifying it. The decorator ensures it's always in sync.\n\n### Step 8: Final verification of the complete implementation\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 1201 (Features class beginning)\nAction: Review\nBefore Code:\n```python\nclass Features(dict):\n    \"\"\"A special dictionary that defines the internal structure of a dataset.\n```\nAfter Code: \nAll changes should be present, ensuring the decorator approach works correctly with all methods\n\nCritical Details: Final review to confirm all methods are properly decorated and the implementation is complete.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The Features class has a separate dictionary `_column_requires_decoding` to track whether features require decoding, but this dictionary is not kept fully synchronized with the main features dictionary across all operations. The current implementation only handles `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` but not all dictionary operations.\n\nGoal: Implement a decorator-based solution to automatically synchronize `_column_requires_decoding` with the main features dictionary for all dictionary operations to prevent inconsistencies.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Ensure all dictionary operations (setitem, delitem, update, etc.) keep both dictionaries in sync\n- Use decorator approach instead of subclassing to avoid performance issues\n- Follow existing code patterns and style\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire `src/datasets/features/features.py` file for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature involves extending the `update` method in the same file\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate on line numbers and make sure our changes don't overlap in the same method implementations\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution uses a decorator pattern to wrap dictionary operations on the Features class to ensure that any modification to the main dictionary also updates the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. This approach avoids the complexity and performance issues of subclassing UserDict while maintaining all functionality.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The decorator approach will wrap methods like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update`\n- Need to ensure that the decorator is applied correctly to maintain the existing behavior\n- Will need to carefully consider the order of operations to avoid recursion issues\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Define the decorator function for keeping features dictionaries synced\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the existing imports and before the Features class definition (around line 42)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\nfrom .translation import Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom .translation import Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages\n\n\ndef keep_features_dicts_synced(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decorator to ensure that the _column_requires_decoding dictionary stays in sync with the main features dictionary.\n    \n    This decorator should be applied to methods that modify the Features dictionary to ensure that\n    the _column_requires_decoding dictionary is updated accordingly.\n    \"\"\"\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Call the original method\n        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Rebuild _column_requires_decoding from scratch to ensure consistency\n        # This is safer than trying to manually update individual entries\n        self._column_requires_decoding = {col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()}\n        \n        return result\n    return wrapper\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing imports, before class definitions. Used a simple approach of rebuilding the entire `_column_requires_decoding` dict rather than trying to manually manage individual updates to prevent potential issues.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the decorator to __setitem__ method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1240 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __setitem__(self, column_name: str, feature: FeatureType):\n        super().__setitem__(column_name, feature)\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    @keep_features_dicts_synced\n    def __setitem__(self, column_name: str, feature: FeatureType):\n        super().__setitem__(column_name, feature)\n        # Note: _column_requires_decoding will be rebuilt by the decorator\n```\nCritical Details: Applied the decorator to the existing `__setitem__` method. Removed the manual update since the decorator handles it.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the decorator to __delitem__ method  \nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1244 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __delitem__(self, column_name: str):\n        super().__delitem__(column_name)\n        del self._column_requires_decoding[column_name]\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    @keep_features_dicts_synced\n    def __delitem__(self, column_name: str):\n        super().__delitem__(column_name)\n        # Note: _column_requires_decoding will be rebuilt by the decorator\n```\nCritical Details: Applied the decorator to the existing `__delitem__` method. Removed the manual deletion since the decorator handles it.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the decorator to update method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1248 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    @keep_features_dicts_synced\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nCritical Details: Applied the decorator to the existing `update` method. This ensures that when update is called, the synchronization happens automatically.\n\n### Step 5: Update the __init__ method to remove redundant initialization\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1234 (in the Features class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {\n            col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()\n        }\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        # _column_requires_decoding will be initialized by the decorator on first access\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {}\n```\nCritical Details: Simplified the initialization to just create an empty dict, since the decorator approach will handle the proper initialization.\n\n### Step 6: Add missing imports needed for the decorator\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 25 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n\nfrom .features import require_decoding\n```\nCritical Details: Added import for `require_decoding` function which is used in the decorator.\n\n### Step 7: Verify that other methods accessing _column_requires_decoding still work correctly\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 1374 (in the Features class)\nAction: Check\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        return {\n            column_name: decode_nested_example(feature, value)\n            if self._column_requires_decoding[column_name]\n            else value\n            for column_name, (feature, value) in zip_dict(\n                self, example, ordered=True\n            ).items()\n        }\n```\nAfter Code: No change needed, this usage pattern is correct\n\nCritical Details: This usage of `_column_requires_decoding` is fine as it's just reading from the dict, not modifying it. The decorator ensures it's always in sync.\n\n### Step 8: Final verification of the complete implementation\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 1201 (Features class beginning)\nAction: Review\nBefore Code:\n```python\nclass Features(dict):\n    \"\"\"A special dictionary that defines the internal structure of a dataset.\n```\nAfter Code: \nAll changes should be present, ensuring the decorator approach works correctly with all methods\n\nCritical Details: Final review to confirm all methods are properly decorated and the implementation is complete.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

The changes are focused specifically on the `update` method, so they won't conflict with any other agent's work on decorator-based synchronization.\n\n"}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 23, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T17:19:20.298751", "source": "agent", "message": "", "action": "edit", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-c5dfc151a0ea4926863ed3c0f3879f00", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-08d1926694a242c2b23f01e41784ae27", "created": 1765127948, "model": "qwen3-coder", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"path\": \"/workspace/src/datasets/features/features.py\", \"command\": \"str_replace\", \"old_str\": \"from .translation import Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages\\n\\n\\nlogger = logging.get_logger(__name__)\\n\\n\\ndef _arrow_to_datasets_dtype(arrow_type: pa.DataType) -> str:\", \"new_str\": \"from .translation import Translation, TranslationVariableLanguages\\n\\n\\ndef keep_features_dicts_synced(func):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Decorator to ensure that the _column_requires_decoding dictionary stays in sync with the main features dictionary.\\n    \\n    This decorator should be applied to methods that modify the Features dictionary to ensure that\\n    the _column_requires_decoding dictionary is updated accordingly.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\\n        #
