Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`.

The NDCG class inherits from BaseRetrievalMetric and implements the compute method to calculate normalized discounted cumulative gain.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The fix involves changing the IDCG calculation logic from using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids)) to using len(expected_ids) directly for the ideal ranking\n- Need to maintain the same function signature and return type\n- Must handle edge cases where there are no relevant documents properly\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Locate the problematic IDCG calculation in NDCG class\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Lines 380-386 in the NDCG.compute() method\nAction: Identify and replace the incorrect IDCG calculation\n\nBefore Code:\n```python\n# Calculate IDCG using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n# Since we can't achieve better than perfect ranking of all relevant docs\nideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\nidcg = sum(\n    discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n    for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Replace the IDCG calculation with correct implementation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Lines 380-386 in the NDCG.compute() method\nAction: Modify to use expected_ids length for ideal ranking calculation\n\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Calculate IDCG using the number of expected relevant documents\n# This represents the best possible ranking of relevant documents\nidcg = sum(\n    discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n    for i in range(1, len(expected_ids) + 1)\n)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Verify the fix handles edge cases correctly\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Lines 388-393 in the NDCG.compute() method\nAction: Ensure existing edge case handling remains intact\n\nBefore Code:\n```python\n# Handle edge case where there are no relevant documents\nif idcg == 0:\n    return RetrievalMetricResult(score=0.0)\n```\n\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Handle edge case where there are no relevant documents\nif idcg == 0:\n    return RetrievalMetricResult(score=0.0)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the complete modified section matches expected behavior\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Lines 374-393 in the NDCG.compute() method\nAction: Replace entire IDCG calculation section\n\nComplete Updated Code:\n```python\n        # Calculate DCG\n        dcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=docid in expected_set, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, docid in enumerate(retrieved_ids, start=1)\n        )\n\n        # Calculate IDCG using the number of expected relevant documents\n        # This represents the best possible ranking of relevant documents\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, len(expected_ids) + 1)\n        )\n\n        # Handle edge case where there are no relevant documents\n        if idcg == 0:\n            return RetrievalMetricResult(score=0.0)\n\n        ndcg_score = dcg / idcg\n        return RetrievalMetricResult(score=ndcg_score)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Review and verify the complete NDCG class remains intact\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nLocation: Lines 320-393 (complete NDCG class)\nAction: Ensure the entire class structure is preserved correctly\n\nThe modification maintains all existing functionality while fixing the core issue with IDCG calculation. The change ensures that when computing NDCG, the ideal ranking (IDCG) is based on the expected relevant documents rather than the retrieved documents, which is the correct mathematical definition of NDCG.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This allows for more nuanced assessments of ranked retrieval results by reflecting varying degrees of importance among retrieved items. Users can now compute NDCG using float relevance scores rather than being restricted to binary relevance.\n\n**Technical Background**\nPreviously, the `NDCG` metric treated all relevant documents equally, assigning them a default score of 1.0. This binary treatment limited the expressiveness of the evaluation, especially in tasks where some documents are more relevant than others. Graded relevance is a standard extension in IR systems to address this limitation.\n\n**Solution**\nThe `compute` method in `NDCG` is extended to accept a new optional parameter: `relevance_scores`, a dictionary mapping `expected_ids` to float relevance values. During computation, these scores are used to calculate both discounted gains and ideal gains. If `relevance_scores` is not provided, the default binary behavior is preserved. \n\n**Files Modified**\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The NDCG retrieval evaluation metric currently only supports binary relevance (all relevant documents get a score of 1.0). The requirement is to enhance it to support graded relevance by allowing users to supply custom float-based relevance scores per expected_id.\n\nGoal: Modify the NDCG class to accept an optional `relevance_scores` parameter that maps expected_ids to float relevance values, enabling more nuanced assessment of ranked retrieval results.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing binary relevance behavior\n- Support custom float relevance scores for each expected document\n- Properly calculate both DCG and IDCG using these relevance scores\n- Handle edge cases appropriately\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire file `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature is different and doesn't conflict with this file\nShared File Strategy: No shared file conflicts\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The NDCG class extends BaseRetrievalMetric and follows the existing pattern of compute methods that take expected_ids and retrieved_ids parameters. The enhancement adds optional relevance_scores parameter to enable graded relevance scoring while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to maintain backward compatibility - when no relevance_scores provided, default to binary (1.0 for relevant, 0.0 for irrelevant)\n- The discounted_gain function already handles the mode parameter correctly\n- Need to properly calculate IDCG using the actual number of relevant documents, not just the minimum of retrieved/expected\n- Must update docstrings to reflect the new parameter\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Update the NDCG class docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 321-328 (within the class docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\nclass NDCG(BaseRetrievalMetric):\n    \"\"\"NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) metric.\n\n    The position `p` is taken as the size of the query results (which is usually\n    `top_k` of the retriever).\n\n    Currently only supports binary relevance\n    (``rel=1`` if document is in ``expected_ids``, otherwise ``rel=0``)\n    since we assume that ``expected_ids`` is unordered.\n\n    Attributes:\n        metric_name (str): The name of the metric.\n        mode (DiscountedGainMode): Determines the formula for each item in the summation.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nclass NDCG(BaseRetrievalMetric):\n    \"\"\"NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) metric.\n\n    The position `p` is taken as the size of the query results (which is usually\n    `top_k` of the retriever).\n\n    Supports both binary relevance (default) and graded relevance.\n    For binary relevance, documents in ``expected_ids`` are assigned relevance 1.0,\n    otherwise relevance 0.0.

This allows for more nuanced assessments of ranked retrieval results by reflecting varying degrees of importance among retrieved items. Users can now compute NDCG using float relevance scores rather than being restricted to binary relevance.\n\n**Technical Background**\nPreviously, the `NDCG` metric treated all relevant documents equally, assigning them a default score of 1.0. This binary treatment limited the expressiveness of the evaluation, especially in tasks where some documents are more relevant than others. Graded relevance is a standard extension in IR systems to address this limitation.\n\n**Solution**\nThe `compute` method in `NDCG` is extended to accept a new optional parameter: `relevance_scores`, a dictionary mapping `expected_ids` to float relevance values. During computation, these scores are used to calculate both discounted gains and ideal gains. If `relevance_scores` is not provided, the default binary behavior is preserved. \n\n**Files Modified**\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The NDCG retrieval evaluation metric currently only supports binary relevance (all relevant documents get a score of 1.0).
