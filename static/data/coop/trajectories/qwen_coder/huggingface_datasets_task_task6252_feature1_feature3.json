Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nHigh-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\nGoal: Introduce an optional `max_resolution` parameter to the `Image` feature that automatically downscales images during decoding to maintain memory efficiency and processing speed.\n\nRequirements: \n- Add `max_resolution` parameter to `Image` feature constructor\n- When an image exceeds the specified width or height, resize it proportionally using Pillow's thumbnail method\n- Maintain backward compatibility - default behavior unchanged\n- Preserve aspect ratio during resizing\n- Handle edge cases gracefully\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire `src/datasets/features/image.py` file modification\nOther Agent Handles: EXIF orientation correction in the same file\nShared File Strategy: We'll both modify the same file but target different methods/parameters:\n- My changes: Constructor (__init__) and decode_example method \n- Their changes: decode_example method for EXIF handling\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class will be extended with a new optional parameter that gets processed during the decode_example phase. The implementation uses Pillow's thumbnail() method which maintains aspect ratio and is efficient for downscaling.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The `max_resolution` parameter will be optional and default to None (backward compatibility)\n- When provided, it should accept a tuple of (max_width, max_height) \n- Implementation will happen in the decode_example method after image loading but before mode conversion\n- Will use Pillow's thumbnail method with `THUMBNAIL` resampling filter for optimal quality\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[tuple] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add the parameter with proper type hint and default value None\n\n### Step 2: Modify decode_example method to handle max_resolution\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I handle lines 134-191 (the decode_example method)\nLocation: After line 190, before return statement\nAction: Insert new logic to handle resolution clamping\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            max_width, max_height = self.max_resolution\n            # Check if image dimensions exceed max resolution\n            if image.width > max_width or image.height > max_height:\n                # Use thumbnail method to resize while preserving aspect ratio\n                image.thumbnail((max_width, max_height), PIL.Image.LANCZOS)\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Place the resolution check after image loading but before mode conversion\n- Use PIL.Image.LANCZOS for high-quality downscaling\n- The thumbnail method modifies the image in-place and maintains aspect ratio\n- Handle None case gracefully with early exit\n\n### Step 3: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I handle lines 62-82 (the docstring)\nLocation: After line 68, before examples section\nAction: Add documentation for max_resolution parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        max_resolution (`tuple`, *optional*):\n            The maximum resolution (width, height) for the decoded image.\n            If the image dimensions exceed these values, it will be downsampled\n            proportionally to fit within the specified bounds while maintaining aspect ratio.\n            Uses Pillow's thumbnail method for efficient resizing.\n```\nCritical Details: Follow the existing docstring format and style exactly\n\n### Step 4: Add validation for max_resolution parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I handle lines 84-87 (parameter initialization)\nLocation: After line 87, before class definition ends\nAction: Add validation for max_resolution parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n    \n    def __post_init__(self):\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            if not isinstance(self.max_resolution, tuple) or len(self.max_resolution) != 2:\n                raise ValueError(\"max_resolution must be a tuple of (max_width, max_height)\")\n            max_width, max_height = self.max_resolution\n            if not isinstance(max_width, int) or not isinstance(max_height, int):\n                raise ValueError(\"max_resolution dimensions must be integers\")\n            if max_width <= 0 or max_height <= 0:\n                raise ValueError(\"max_resolution dimensions must be positive integers\")\n```\nCritical Details: Add validation in __post_init__ to ensure correct format and values\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5.

If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected when loaded via PIL, leading to inconsistent image orientations that cause issues in tasks requiring spatial alignment (object detection, layout modeling).\n\nGoal: Implement automatic EXIF orientation correction by applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during image decoding in the `Image` feature class.\n\nRequirements: \n- Apply EXIF correction automatically when decoding images\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Don't break existing functionality\n- Handle cases where EXIF data might not exist\n- Integrate cleanly with existing code structure\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own `src/datasets/features/image.py` entirely for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature (max resolution clamping) will modify the same file but in different areas\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate on the decode_example method location. My changes will be applied right before the return statement in decode_example, while their changes will likely affect the constructor/__init__ method.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution modifies the `decode_example` method in the `Image` class to automatically detect and correct EXIF orientation data using PIL's `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` function. This is done right before returning the image to ensure proper orientation without affecting other processing.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to import `PIL.ImageOps` \n- EXIF correction should only happen when PIL is available\n- Should not interfere with existing mode conversion or other processing\n- The fix should be transparent to users (no API changes)\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add import for PIL.ImageOps\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 18 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add import statement\nBefore Code: \n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nCritical Details: Add the PIL.ImageOps import right after the existing PIL imports\n\n### Step 2: Modify the decode_example method to add EXIF correction\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 190 (before the return statement in decode_example)\nAction: Insert EXIF correction logic\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if available\n        try:\n            # Check if image has EXIF data and orientation tag\n            if hasattr(image, '_getexif') and image._getexif() is not None:\n                exif = image._getexif()\n                if exif is not None and 274 in exif:\n                    # Apply EXIF orientation correction\n                    from PIL import ImageOps\n                    image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n        except Exception:\n            # If there's any error with EXIF processing, continue without correction\n            pass\n            \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Place this logic right before the return statement\n- Use try/except to avoid breaking on malformed EXIF data\n- Import ImageOps inside the function to avoid circular imports\n- Only perform correction when EXIF data exists\n- Preserve existing behavior for all other cases\n\n### Step 3: Update imports section to include PIL.ImageOps\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 106 (in the encode_example method where PIL is imported)\nAction: Add import for ImageOps when needed\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support encoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support encoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nCritical Details: No change needed here as we'll import ImageOps locally in the decode_example method\n\n### Step 4: Update imports section around line 156 (in decode_example method)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 156 (in the decode_example method where PIL is imported)\nAction: Add import for ImageOps when needed\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nCritical Details: No change needed here as we'll import ImageOps locally in the decode_example method\n\n### Step 5: Verify the complete decode_example method structure\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 134-191\nAction: Confirm the final structure includes our EXIF correction\nBefore Code: \nThe full decode_example method as shown in previous reads\nAfter Code:\nThe full decode_example method with EXIF correction inserted before return\nCritical Details: The structure should now include EXIF correction logic right before the final return statement\n\nThis approach ensures:\n1. Backward compatibility is maintained\n2. EXIF correction is only applied when appropriate\n3. Errors in EXIF processing don't break the entire decoding pipeline\n4. The feature works seamlessly with existing code\n5. No conflicts with other agents' changes to the same file\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected when loaded via PIL, leading to inconsistent image orientations that cause issues in tasks requiring spatial alignment (object detection, layout modeling).\n\nGoal: Implement automatic EXIF orientation correction by applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during image decoding in the `Image` feature class.\n\nRequirements: \n- Apply EXIF correction automatically when decoding images\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Don't break existing functionality\n- Handle cases where EXIF data might not exist\n- Integrate cleanly with existing code structure\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own `src/datasets/features/image.py` entirely for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature (max resolution clamping) will modify the same file but in different areas\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate on the decode_example method location. My changes will be applied right before the return statement in decode_example, while their changes will likely affect the constructor/__init__ method.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution modifies the `decode_example` method in the `Image` class to automatically detect and correct EXIF orientation data using PIL's `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` function. This is done right before returning the image to ensure proper orientation without affecting other processing.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to import `PIL.ImageOps` \n- EXIF correction should only happen when PIL is available\n- Should not interfere with existing mode conversion or other processing\n- The fix should be transparent to users (no API changes)\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add import for PIL.ImageOps\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 18 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add import statement\nBefore Code: \n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nCritical Details: Add the PIL.ImageOps import right after the existing PIL imports\n\n### Step 2: Modify the decode_example method to add EXIF correction\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Line 190 (before the return statement in decode_example)\nAction: Insert EXIF correction logic\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if available\n        try:\n            # Check if image has EXIF data and orientation tag\n            if hasattr(image, '_getexif') and image._getexif() is not None:\n                exif = image._getexif()\n                if exif is not None and 274 in exif:\n                    # Apply EXIF orientation correction\n                    from PIL import ImageOps\n                    image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n        except Exception:\n            # If there's any error with EXIF processing, continue without correction\n            pass\n            \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Place this logic right before the return statement\n- Use try/except to avoid breaking on malformed EXIF data\n- Import ImageOps inside the function to avoid circular imports\n- Only perform correction when EXIF data exists\n- Preserve existing behavior for all other cases\n\n### Step 3: Update imports section to include PIL.ImageOps\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 106 (in the encode_example method where PIL is imported)\nAction: Add import for ImageOps when needed\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support encoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support encoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nCritical Details: No change needed here as we'll import ImageOps locally in the decode_example method\n\n### Step 4: Update imports section around line 156 (in decode_example method)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Around line 156 (in the decode_example method where PIL is imported)\nAction: Add import for ImageOps when needed\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nCritical Details: No change needed here as we'll import ImageOps locally in the decode_example method\n\n### Step 5: Verify the complete decode_example method structure\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nLocation: Lines 134-191\nAction: Confirm the final structure includes our EXIF correction\nBefore Code: \nThe full decode_example method as shown in previous reads\nAfter Code:\nThe full decode_example method with EXIF correction inserted before return\nCritical Details: The structure should now include EXIF correction logic right before the final return statement\n\nThis approach ensures:\n1. Backward compatibility is maintained\n2. EXIF correction is only applied when appropriate\n3. Errors in EXIF processing don't break the entire decoding pipeline\n4. The feature works seamlessly with existing code\n5. No conflicts with other agents' changes to the same file\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.
