Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class.

This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected when loaded via PIL, leading to inconsistent image orientations that cause issues in tasks requiring spatial alignment (object detection, layout modeling).\n\nGoal: Implement automatic EXIF orientation correction by applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during image decoding in the `datasets.features.Image` class.\n\nRequirements: \n- Preserve backward compatibility\n- Only apply correction when EXIF orientation data exists\n- Work seamlessly with existing image loading mechanisms\n- Handle all image formats that support EXIF data\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Both agents will modify `src/datasets/features/image.py` \nOther Agent Handles: Center-cropping feature implementation\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate placement of our modifications in the decode_example method:\n- Agent 1 (EXIF correction): Will insert EXIF correction logic after image loading but before mode conversion\n- Agent 2 (Center-crop): Will insert crop logic after image loading but before mode conversion\nBoth modifications will be placed at similar locations to avoid conflicts\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The implementation will modify the `decode_example` method in the `Image` class to check for EXIF orientation data and apply automatic correction using PIL's `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` function.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to import `ImageOps` from PIL\n- Should only apply transformation when EXIF data is present\n- Must maintain existing behavior for images without EXIF data\n- The fix should happen right after the image is loaded but before it's returned\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Update imports in decode_example method to include ImageOps\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own this modification (shared with other agent)\nLocation: Around line 155-157, inside the decode_example method\nAction: Add ImageOps import to the conditional import block\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n            from PIL import ImageOps\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nCritical Details: Added ImageOps import alongside PIL.Image in the same conditional block\n\n### Step 2: Modify the decode_example method to add EXIF correction\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own this modification (shared with other agent)\nLocation: Around line 187-190, after image is loaded but before returning\nAction: Insert EXIF orientation correction logic\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        \n        # Apply automatic EXIF orientation correction\n        try:\n            # Check if image has EXIF data and orientation tag\n            if hasattr(image, '_getexif') and image._getexif() is not None:\n                exif = image._getexif()\n                if exif is not None and 270 in exif:\n                    # Apply EXIF orientation correction\n                    image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n        except Exception:\n            # If there's any issue with EXIF processing, continue without correction\n            pass\n            \n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Added try/except to prevent crashes from malformed EXIF data\n- Used hasattr check to safely test for EXIF support\n- Applied exif_transpose only when EXIF orientation data exists\n- Placed correction right after image loading and before mode checks\n- Maintained all existing functionality\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios, but many computer vision models expect square inputs. Users need to manually preprocess images to ensure uniform dimensions.\nGoal: Add optional center-cropping to square aspect ratio for decoded images in the Image feature class.\nRequirements: \n- Add `crop_to_square` parameter to Image class constructor\n- Implement automatic center-cropping in decode_example method\n- Apply crop before mode conversion to ensure consistent square output\n- Maintain backward compatibility (default to False)\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own `src/datasets/features/image.py` entirely for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: EXIF orientation correction in the same file\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate placement in the decode_example method - I'll handle crop logic and they'll handle EXIF correction, both in the same location (after image loading but before mode conversion)\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class will be extended with a new boolean parameter `crop_to_square` that, when enabled, automatically crops images to a square aspect ratio by taking the center portion of the image using the shorter dimension as reference.\nCritical Notes: \n- Import `PIL.ImageOps` for center cropping functionality\n- Crop operation must happen before mode conversion to maintain consistency\n- Default value for `crop_to_square` is False to preserve backward compatibility\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Place after existing parameters and before the ClassVar declarations\n\n### Step 2: Add PIL.ImageOps import\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 16 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n\n    from PIL import ImageOps\n```\nCritical Details: Add the import inside the TYPE_CHECKING block to avoid runtime overhead\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to add crop functionality\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 188-190 (before mode conversion)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.crop_to_square:\n            # Center crop to square\n            min_dimension = min(image.size)\n            left = (image.width - min_dimension) // 2\n            top = (image.height - min_dimension) // 2\n            right = left + min_dimension\n            bottom = top + min_dimension\n            image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Place the crop logic right after image loading but before mode conversion to ensure consistent square output regardless of original aspect ratio\n\n### Step 4: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Lines 62-68 (inside class docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios, but many computer vision models expect square inputs.

If True, the image is cropped to the largest possible square centered in the image.\"\n\n### Key Features of Implementation:\n\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Default value is False, so existing code continues to work unchanged\n- **Proper Placement**: Crop happens before mode conversion, ensuring consistent square output\n- **Correct Algorithm**: Uses the minimum dimension to determine square size and centers the crop\n- **Edge Cases Handled**: Works with portrait, landscape, and square images\n- **Minimal Impact**: Only adds functionality when explicitly enabled\n\n### Testing Performed:\n\n1. Verified basic instantiation works with and without the parameter\n2. Tested backward compatibility (default behavior unchanged)\n3. Tested forward compatibility (new parameter works correctly)\n4. Tested cropping logic with various image dimensions:\n   - Wide images (600x400 \u2192 400x400)\n   - Portrait images (400x600 \u2192 400x400) \n   - Square images (400x400 \u2192 400x400)\n   - Very wide images (1000x200 \u2192 200x200)\n\nThe implementation exactly matches the requirements in the plan and handles all edge cases properly.
