Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The Features class in `src/datasets/features/features.py` maintains a secondary dictionary `_column_requires_decoding` to track whether columns require decoding, but this dictionary is not consistently synchronized with the main features dictionary across all operations. Currently, only `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` methods manually synchronize the dictionaries, but other operations like `update()` are not handled.\n\nGoal: Implement a decorator that automatically keeps the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary for all dictionary operations.\n\nRequirements: \n- Ensure that all dictionary operations (add, remove, update, etc.) automatically maintain synchronization\n- Avoid subclassing `UserDict` to prevent performance issues and breaking changes\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Handle all relevant dictionary methods properly\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire modification of `src/datasets/features/features.py` for the decorator implementation\nOther Agent Handles: They are working on extending the `require_decoding` function and related functionality\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate to ensure our changes don't conflict in the same file. I will implement the decorator in a way that doesn't interfere with their modifications to the `require_decoding` function.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution will use a decorator approach to wrap dictionary methods instead of subclassing `UserDict`. This approach avoids performance penalties and breaking changes while ensuring automatic synchronization.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The decorator must wrap all methods that modify the dictionary contents\n- Need to preserve the existing `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` implementations but enhance them\n- The decorator should handle both individual operations and bulk operations like `update()`\n- Must maintain proper error handling and behavior consistency\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add the keep_features_dicts_synced decorator\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: After the existing imports and before the Features class definition (around line 45)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\nlogger = logging.get_logger(__name__)\n\n\ndef _arrow_to_datasets_dtype(arrow_type: pa.DataType) -> str:\n```\n\nAfter Code:\n```python\nlogger = logging.get_logger(__name__)\n\n\ndef keep_features_dicts_synced(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decorator to keep the _column_requires_decoding dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary.\n    \n    This decorator ensures that all modifications to the Features dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.)\n    are automatically reflected in the _column_requires_decoding tracking dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        #

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T17:11:11.860846", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:53418": 53418, "http://localhost:56759": 56759}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-12-07", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T17:11:12.150503", "source": "agent", "message": "Reading file: /workspace/src/datasets/features/features.py", "action": "read", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-232b28a9dd8048449ba51304ba8791be", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-fc5a10205a1a4b32bae245900bbf2deb", "created": 1765127468, "model": "qwen3-coder", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I'll implement the feature to sync the Features dictionaries as described in the plan.
