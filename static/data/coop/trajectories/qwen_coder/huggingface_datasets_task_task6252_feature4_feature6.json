Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The bash command to execute.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Users need to remove edge artifacts like watermarks or borders from images during dataset preparation, which currently requires manual post-processing. \nGoal: Add an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature that automatically crops a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding.\nRequirements: The parameter should accept integer values specifying pixels to crop from all four edges, preserve the original image center, and integrate seamlessly with existing functionality.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire `src/datasets/features/image.py` file modification for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: The other agent will implement CMYK to RGB conversion in the same file\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate on line placement to avoid merge conflicts by making minimal, well-scoped changes\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The implementation will extend the existing Image class dataclass with a new crop_margin parameter and modify the decode_example method to apply cropping when needed. This follows existing patterns in the codebase where additional parameters are added to dataclass constructors.\nCritical Notes: The crop operation uses PIL's built-in crop() method, maintaining backward compatibility since the parameter is optional with a default value of None. The cropping happens after image loading but before mode conversion.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int], Tuple[int, int, int, int]]] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added the crop_margin parameter with appropriate type hints (Union of int, tuple of 2 ints, or tuple of 4 ints) and default value of None to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 67 (after existing docstring parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data.

If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_margin (`int` or `tuple`, *optional*):\n            The number of pixels to crop from each edge of the image. If an `int`, the same margin is applied to all four edges.\n            If a `tuple` of 2 ints, the first is applied to top/bottom and the second to left/right.\n            If a `tuple` of 4 ints, they represent (top, right, bottom, left) margins respectively.\n            If `None`, no cropping is performed.\n```\nCritical Details: Added comprehensive documentation for the new parameter including examples of valid inputs.\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to apply cropping when needed\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 190 (before returning image)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.crop_margin is not None:\n            # Apply cropping if crop_margin is specified\n            width, height = image.size\n            if isinstance(self.crop_margin, int):\n                # Uniform margin for all edges\n                left = top = right = bottom = self.crop_margin\n            elif len(self.crop_margin) == 2:\n                # Different margins for vertical and horizontal\n                top = bottom = self.crop_margin[0]\n                left = right = self.crop_margin[1]\n            else:\n                # Specific margins for each edge\n                top, right, bottom, left = self.crop_margin\n            \n            # Ensure margins don't exceed image dimensions\n            left = min(left, width // 2)\n            right = min(right, width // 2)\n            top = min(top, height // 2)\n            bottom = min(bottom, height // 2)\n            \n            # Crop the image\n            image = image.crop((left, top, width - right, height - bottom))\n        \n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added cropping logic that handles different input formats (int, 2-tuple, 4-tuple) and ensures margins don't exceed half the image dimensions to prevent negative cropping.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Optional Image Border Cropping Support\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature, allowing users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding. This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Users need to remove edge artifacts like watermarks or borders from images during dataset preparation, which currently requires manual post-processing. \nGoal: Add an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature that automatically crops a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding.\nRequirements: The parameter should accept integer values specifying pixels to crop from all four edges, preserve the original image center, and integrate seamlessly with existing functionality.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire `src/datasets/features/image.py` file modification for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: The other agent will implement CMYK to RGB conversion in the same file\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate on line placement to avoid merge conflicts by making minimal, well-scoped changes\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The implementation will extend the existing Image class dataclass with a new crop_margin parameter and modify the decode_example method to apply cropping when needed. This follows existing patterns in the codebase where additional parameters are added to dataclass constructors.\nCritical Notes: The crop operation uses PIL's built-in crop() method, maintaining backward compatibility since the parameter is optional with a default value of None. The cropping happens after image loading but before mode conversion.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int], Tuple[int, int, int, int]]] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added the crop_margin parameter with appropriate type hints (Union of int, tuple of 2 ints, or tuple of 4 ints) and default value of None to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 67 (after existing docstring parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_margin (`int` or `tuple`, *optional*):\n            The number of pixels to crop from each edge of the image. If an `int`, the same margin is applied to all four edges.\n            If a `tuple` of 2 ints, the first is applied to top/bottom and the second to left/right.\n            If a `tuple` of 4 ints, they represent (top, right, bottom, left) margins respectively.\n            If `None`, no cropping is performed.\n```\nCritical Details: Added comprehensive documentation for the new parameter including examples of valid inputs.\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to apply cropping when needed\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 190 (before returning image)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.crop_margin is not None:\n            # Apply cropping if crop_margin is specified\n            width, height = image.size\n            if isinstance(self.crop_margin, int):\n                # Uniform margin for all edges\n                left = top = right = bottom = self.crop_margin\n            elif len(self.crop_margin) == 2:\n                # Different margins for vertical and horizontal\n                top = bottom = self.crop_margin[0]\n                left = right = self.crop_margin[1]\n            else:\n                # Specific margins for each edge\n                top, right, bottom, left = self.crop_margin\n            \n            # Ensure margins don't exceed image dimensions\n            left = min(left, width // 2)\n            right = min(right, width // 2)\n            top = min(top, height // 2)\n            bottom = min(bottom, height // 2)\n            \n            # Crop the image\n            image = image.crop((left, top, width - right, height - bottom))\n        \n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added cropping logic that handles different input formats (int, 2-tuple, 4-tuple) and ensures margins don't exceed half the image dimensions to prevent negative cropping. The cropping is applied before mode conversion to maintain consistency.\n\n### Step 4: Add example to docstring showing usage\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 80 (end of docstring examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n     {'bytes': None,\n      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n     ```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n     {'bytes': None,\n      'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n     >>> # Crop 10 pixels from each edge\n     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(crop_margin=10))\n     >>> # Crop 5 pixels from top/bottom, 10 from left/right\n     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(crop_margin=(5, 10)))\n     >>> # Crop specific margins (top, right, bottom, left)\n     >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(crop_margin=(5, 10, 5, 10)))\n     ```\nCritical Details: Added three usage examples demonstrating different ways to specify the crop_margin parameter.\n\n### Step 5: Import necessary types for type hints\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 6 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Union\n```\nCritical Details: Added Tuple to the imports to support the type hints for the crop_margin parameter.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

I have successfully implemented the optional image border cropping support feature. Let me summarize what I've accomplished:\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nI have successfully added the optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature in `/workspace/src/datasets/features/image.py` according to the implementation plan. Here are the specific changes made:\n\n### 1. Added crop_margin parameter to Image class dataclass (line 87)\n- Added `crop_margin: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int], Tuple[int, int, int, int]]] = None` \n- Maintained backward compatibility with default value of None\n\n### 2. Updated docstring documentation (lines 68-72)\n- Added comprehensive documentation for the new parameter\n- Explained all valid input formats: int, 2-tuple, 4-tuple\n- Clarified behavior when parameter is None\n\n### 3. Added usage examples to docstring (lines 86-91)\n- Example 1: Crop 10 pixels from each edge (`crop_margin=10`)\n- Example 2: Different margins for vertical/horizontal (`crop_margin=(5, 10)`)\n- Example 3: Specific margins for each edge (`crop_margin=(5, 10, 5, 10)`)\n\n### 4. Enhanced type hints (line 6)\n- Added `Tuple` to the import statement to support the new parameter types\n\n### 5. Implemented cropping logic in decode_example method (lines 201-222)\n- Added cropping functionality that handles all three input formats\n- Implemented proper bounds checking to prevent negative cropping\n- Applied cropping before mode conversion to maintain consistency\n- Used PIL's built-in `crop()` method for efficient implementation\n\nThe implementation follows all requirements:\n- \u2705 Backward compatible (default value of None)\n- \u2705 Supports all specified input formats (int, 2-tuple, 4-tuple)\n- \u2705 Prevents invalid cropping operations\n- \u2705 Integrates seamlessly with existing functionality\n- \u2705 Uses PIL's efficient crop method\n- \u2705 Properly positioned in the codebase\n\nAll changes are properly scoped and won't conflict with any other agent's work on CMYK conversion in the same file.\n\n", "action": "finish", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "finish", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-47886beebad743cd86d8e11446bd2f45", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-48caf2efa60449e9bdcbf56d76881db8", "created": 1765134862, "model": "qwen3-coder", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "Perfect!
