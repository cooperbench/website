Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The caching mechanism stores results of decoding checks for each feature and reuses them for subsequent checks. This enhancement may impact the synchronization behavior in the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator, and adjustments have been made to accommodate this.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe `require_decoding` function recalculates decoding requirements each time it is called, which can result in unnecessary performance overhead, especially when called multiple times for the same features.\n\n**Solution**:\nA caching mechanism is introduced to store the results of decoding checks for features. This improves performance by reducing redundant calculations. Changes are also made to ensure compatibility with the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The `require_decoding` function recalculates decoding requirements each time it is called, resulting in unnecessary performance overhead when called multiple times for the same features.\n\nGoal: Introduce a caching mechanism in the `require_decoding` function to improve performance by avoiding redundant recalculations of decoding requirements.\n\nRequirements: \n- Cache results of decoding checks for each feature\n- Reuse cached results for subsequent checks with identical features\n- Ensure compatibility with the existing `Features` class and its `_column_requires_decoding` caching\n- Handle potential synchronization issues with the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator (mentioned in PR description)\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the modification of `src/datasets/features/features.py` specifically for the `require_decoding` function caching\nOther Agent Handles: They are working on extending the `update` method in the Features class\nShared File Strategy: We are both modifying the same file but working on different sections (require_decoding function vs update method)\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The caching will be implemented using Python's functools.lru_cache decorator or a manual cache mechanism.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`.

The enhanced method improves flexibility when working with diverse data types, though it may conflict with the existing decorator-enhanced update method.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `update` method in `Features` only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe method is modified to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates. Careful attention was given to ensure compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method, though there is potential for conflict.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The current `update` method in the `Features` class only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.\n\nGoal: Extend the `update` method to support additional types (like JSON) and allow for batch updates while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nRequirements: \n- Support additional data types beyond the current implementation\n- Enable batch updates for multiple features at once\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n- Handle both dict-like and iterable inputs properly\n- Follow existing code patterns and conventions\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire modification to the `update` method in src/datasets/features/features.py\nOther Agent Handles: Caching for the `require_decoding` function around line 1181\nShared File Strategy: The files are different sections of the same file, so no direct conflicts expected\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `Features` class inherits from `dict`, and the update method needs to be enhanced to handle more flexible input types and batch operations while preserving the existing functionality.\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing dict and iterable inputs\n- Should support JSON-style dictionaries with proper feature conversion\n- Must handle keyword arguments correctly\n- Should integrate well with existing `_column_requires_decoding` logic\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Read current update method implementation\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Lines 1248-1256\nAction: Examine existing implementation to understand current behavior\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nCritical Details: This current implementation only handles basic dict-like objects and iterables, but doesn't support JSON or more complex batch operations.\n\n### Step 2: Enhance update method to support JSON and additional types\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Lines 1248-1256 (replace existing method)\nAction: Replace with enhanced implementation that supports additional types and batch updates\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable=None, **kwds):\n        #
