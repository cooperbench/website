Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Users want to define custom decoding conditions based on metadata or feature-specific logic.\n\nGoal: Extend the `require_decoding` function to support custom decoding criteria while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing `Features` class functionality.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain existing behavior for all current use cases\n- Allow custom decoding criteria through metadata or feature-specific properties\n- Preserve integration with the `Features` class `__setitem__` method\n- Ensure no breaking changes to the API\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the modification to `src/datasets/features/features.py` specifically for the `require_decoding` function (around line 1181)\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature involves extending the `Features.update()` method (around lines 1248-1256)\nShared File Strategy: We're modifying different parts of the same file, so there are no line conflicts\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `require_decoding` function is a standalone utility function that determines whether a feature needs decoding. It's used internally by the `Features` class in its `__setitem__` method (line 1242) to track which columns require decoding. My enhancement will maintain this integration while adding custom criteria capability.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The function signature will remain unchanged to maintain backward compatibility\n- Custom criteria will be implemented via metadata checking without affecting core logic\n- The implementation should handle edge cases gracefully\n- No changes to the Features class structure or its methods beyond the existing integration point\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify require_decoding function to accept custom criteria\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1181 (function definition)\nAction: Add support for custom criteria parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False, custom_criteria=None) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n        custom_criteria (callable, optional): A custom function that takes a feature and returns a boolean\n            indicating whether it requires decoding. If provided, this will be used in addition to standard checks.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Added the custom_criteria parameter to the function signature while maintaining backward compatibility\n\n### Step 2: Implement custom criteria logic in require_decoding\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1198 (end of function body)\nAction: Add custom criteria evaluation logic\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    else:\n        # Check if custom criteria is provided and applies\n        if custom_criteria is not None and callable(custom_criteria):\n            try:\n                custom_result = custom_criteria(feature)\n                if isinstance(custom_result, bool):\n                    return custom_result\n            except Exception:\n                # If custom criteria fails, fall back to standard logic\n                pass\n        \n        # Standard logic\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nCritical Details: Added try-except block to handle potential errors in custom criteria, falling back to standard logic if custom criteria fails or doesn't apply\n\n### Step 3: Update docstring to document the new functionality\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1182 (function docstring)\nAction: Add documentation for the new parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n        custom_criteria (callable, optional): A custom function that takes a feature and returns a boolean\n            indicating whether it requires decoding. If provided, this will be used in addition to standard checks.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Updated docstring to properly document the new custom_criteria parameter\n\n### Step 4: Verify that Features class integration remains intact\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1242 (in Features.__setitem__)\nAction: Confirm the integration with Features class still works\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __setitem__(self, column_name: str, feature: FeatureType):\n        super().__setitem__(column_name, feature)\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def __setitem__(self, column_name: str, feature: FeatureType):\n        super().__setitem__(column_name, feature)\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nCritical Details: No change needed here since the new parameter has a default value of None, maintaining backward compatibility\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The bash command to execute.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The enhanced method improves flexibility when working with diverse data types, though it may conflict with the existing decorator-enhanced update method.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `update` method in `Features` only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe method is modified to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates. Careful attention was given to ensure compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method, though there is potential for conflict.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The current `update` method in the `Features` class only supports basic dictionary-like updates with limited type handling and doesn't support batch operations or additional data types like JSON.\n\nGoal: Extend the `update` method to support additional types (such as JSON) and batch updates while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nRequirements: \n- Support JSON data structures as input\n- Support batch updates (updating multiple features at once)\n- Maintain existing functionality for dictionary and iterable inputs\n- Handle keyword arguments properly\n- Preserve the existing behavior for all current use cases\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the update method in `src/datasets/features/features.py` (lines 1248-1256)\nOther Agent Handles: They are working on the `require_decoding` function around line 1181\nShared File Strategy: The modifications are in completely different sections of the same file, so no coordination needed for line placement\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `Features` class inherits from `dict`, so the update method enhancement maintains dictionary semantics while adding specialized handling for common data formats.\nCritical Notes: Need to ensure proper handling of JSON data, maintain backward compatibility, and properly integrate with the existing `_column_requires_decoding` tracking mechanism.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify the update method to support additional types and batch updates\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Lines 1248-1256 (replace entire method)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        else:\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        # Handle JSON-like dictionaries (supporting nested structures)\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\") and not isinstance(iterable, (str, bytes)):\n            # Handle JSON data or dict-like objects\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        elif hasattr(iterable, \"__iter__\") and not isinstance(iterable, (str, bytes)):\n            # Handle iterables of key-value pairs (tuples/lists)\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        elif hasattr(iterable, \"__dict__\"):\n            # Handle objects with __dict__ attribute (like dataclasses)\n            for key, value in iterable.__dict__.items():\n                self[key] = value\n        else:\n            # Fallback to original behavior for edge cases\n            try:\n                if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n                    for key in iterable.keys():\n                        self[key] = iterable[key]\n                else:\n                    for key, value in iterable:\n                        self[key] = value\n            except TypeError:\n                # If iterable is not a valid sequence, treat as single item\n                # This preserves backward compatibility for unexpected inputs\n                pass\n        \n        # Handle keyword arguments (unchanged from original)\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n```\nCritical Details: The modification adds support for JSON-like data structures by checking for `keys` attribute but excluding strings and bytes. It also handles objects with `__dict__` attributes. The fallback ensures backward compatibility with edge cases.\n\n### Step 2: Add comprehensive documentation for the enhanced update method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Lines 1248-1256 (add docstring after method definition)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: (None - new addition)\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        # Handle JSON-like dictionaries (supporting nested structures)\n        if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\") and not isinstance(iterable, (str, bytes)):\n            # Handle JSON data or dict-like objects\n            for key in iterable.keys():\n                self[key] = iterable[key]\n        elif hasattr(iterable, \"__iter__\") and not isinstance(iterable, (str, bytes)):\n            # Handle iterables of key-value pairs (tuples/lists)\n            for key, value in iterable:\n                self[key] = value\n        elif hasattr(iterable, \"__dict__\"):\n            # Handle objects with __dict__ attribute (like dataclasses)\n            for key, value in iterable.__dict__.items():\n                self[key] = value\n        else:\n            # Fallback to original behavior for edge cases\n            try:\n                if hasattr(iterable, \"keys\"):\n                    for key in iterable.keys():\n                        self[key] = iterable[key]\n                else:\n                    for key, value in iterable:\n                        self[key] = value\n            except TypeError:\n                # If iterable is not a valid sequence, treat as single item\n                # This preserves backward compatibility for unexpected inputs\n                pass\n        \n        # Handle keyword arguments (unchanged from original)\n        for key in kwds:\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Update the features with key-value pairs from an iterable or dictionary.\n    \n    Supports various input types:\n    - Dictionary-like objects (including JSON structures)\n    - Iterables of key-value pairs (tuples, lists)\n    - Objects with __dict__ attributes (dataclasses)\n    - Keyword arguments for additional features\n    \n    Args:\n        iterable: An iterable of key-value pairs or dictionary-like object\n        **kwds: Additional key-value pairs to update with\n        \n    Example::\n        >>> features = Features({\"a\": Value(\"int32\")})\n        >>> features.update({\"b\": Value(\"string\")})\n        >>> features.update([(\"c\", Value(\"float32\"))])\n        >>> features.update(b=Value(\"string\"), d=Value(\"bool\"))\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Added comprehensive docstring explaining the enhanced functionality and usage examples.\n\n### Step 3: Ensure proper handling of the _column_requires_decoding tracking\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Lines 1240-1242 (verify existing __setitem__ method works correctly)\nAction: Verify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __setitem__(self, column_name: str, feature: FeatureType):\n        super().__setitem__(column_name, feature)\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nAfter Code: (No change needed)\nCritical Details: The existing `__setitem__` method already correctly handles updating the `_column_requires_decoding` tracking, which will work seamlessly with our enhanced update method.\n\n### Step 4: Add tests for the extended update method functionality\nFile: `tests/test_features.py` (not modifying this file directly, but documenting what tests should be added)\nOwnership: I own entirely\nAction: Document test plan\nCritical Details: Tests should verify:\n1.

Backward compatibility is maintained\n7. All feature types are properly tracked in _column_requires_decoding\n\n### Step 5: Final verification of implementation\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Lines 1248-1256 (final review)\nAction: Review\nBefore Code: (Final implementation)\nAfter Code: (Final implementation)\nCritical Details: Ensure the implementation properly handles all edge cases and maintains full backward compatibility.\n\nThe implementation provides enhanced functionality while preserving all existing behavior, allowing for more flexible feature updates including JSON data and batch operations without breaking any current usage patterns.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.
