Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The thumbnail method modifies images in-place and respects the \"preserve aspect ratio\" behavior.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely \nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing parameters, default value is None to indicate no resolution limitation\n\n### Step 2: Import required modules for PIL operations\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 15 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\nCritical Details: No changes needed here since PIL is already imported in decode_example\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to apply max_resolution constraint\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 190 (before return statement)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply max resolution constraint if specified\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            # Use thumbnail method which preserves aspect ratio and clamps dimensions\n            image.thumbnail((self.max_resolution, self.max_resolution), PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)\n        \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added after mode conversion but before returning the image. Uses PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS for high-quality downsampling.\n\n### Step 4: Add documentation for the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 62 (in docstring, after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios, but many computer vision models expect square inputs.

Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`.

The solution uses Pillow's thumbnail() method which maintains aspect ratio while respecting maximum dimensions.\nCritical Notes: Need to ensure the parameter is optional with default None to maintain backward compatibility. The thumbnail method modifies images in-place and respects the \"preserve aspect ratio\" behavior.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely \nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing parameters, default value is None to indicate no resolution limitation\n\n### Step 2: Import required modules for PIL operations\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 15 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\nCritical Details: No changes needed here since PIL is already imported in decode_example\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to apply max_resolution constraint\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 190 (before return statement)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply max resolution constraint if specified\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            # Use thumbnail method which preserves aspect ratio and clamps dimensions\n            image.thumbnail((self.max_resolution, self.max_resolution), PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)\n        \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added after mode conversion but before returning the image.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios, but many computer vision models expect square inputs.
