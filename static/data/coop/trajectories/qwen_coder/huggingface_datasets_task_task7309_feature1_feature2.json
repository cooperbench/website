Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Users can now provide a `sort_by` parameter in the `ParquetConfig` class, enabling the sorting of data as it streams. This is particularly useful in cases where ordered data is required before further processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nStreaming data in its original order can be inefficient or impractical when ordered data is required for subsequent operations.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution adds a `sort_by` parameter to the `ParquetConfig` class, which allows users to specify a column for sorting while streaming parquet data. This improves the usability of the dataset in scenarios where data order is crucial.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Users need the ability to specify a column for sorting during streaming of parquet data to ensure ordered data for subsequent processing operations.\nGoal: Add a `sort_by` parameter to the `ParquetConfig` class that enables sorting data as it streams from parquet files.\nRequirements: \n- The sort_by parameter should accept a column name string\n- When specified, data should be sorted by that column during streaming\n- The implementation should maintain backward compatibility\n- Should integrate cleanly with existing parquet streaming functionality\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py` entirely for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature involves adding a `filters` parameter to `ParquetConfig` and modifying `_generate_tables` for buffered reading\nShared File Strategy: We're both working on the same file but adding completely different functionality, so no coordination needed on line placement\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The feature extends the existing ParquetConfig dataclass to include a sort_by parameter and modifies the data generation logic to support sorting when requested. The sorting will happen at the batch level during iteration.\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to add proper type hints for the new parameter\n- The sorting should be done efficiently using PyArrow's sorting capabilities\n- Must maintain the existing API contract and not break backward compatibility\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add sort_by parameter to ParquetConfig dataclass\nFile: `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 21 (after features parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n    sort_by: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added the new parameter with default None value to maintain backward compatibility\n\n### Step 2: Modify _generate_tables method to support sorting\nFile: `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 86 (inside the iter_batches loop)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```\n                        for batch_idx, record_batch in enumerate(\n                            parquet_file.iter_batches(batch_size=batch_size, columns=self.config.columns)\n                        ):\n                            pa_table = pa.Table.from_batches([record_batch])\n                            # Uncomment for debugging (will print the Arrow table size and elements)\n                            # logger.warning(f\"pa_table: {pa_table} num rows: {pa_table.num_rows}\")\n                            # logger.warning('\\n'.join(str(pa_table.slice(i, 1).to_pydict()) for i in range(pa_table.num_rows)))\n                            yield f\"{file_idx}_{batch_idx}\", self._cast_table(pa_table)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n                        for batch_idx, record_batch in enumerate(\n                            parquet_file.iter_batches(batch_size=batch_size, columns=self.config.columns)\n                        ):\n                            pa_table = pa.Table.from_batches([record_batch])\n                            # Sort the table if sort_by parameter is specified\n                            if self.config.sort_by is not None:\n                                try:\n                                    pa_table = pa_table.sort_by([(self.config.sort_by, \"ascending\")])\n                                except Exception as e:\n                                    logger.warning(f\"Failed to sort table by '{self.config.sort_by}': {e}\")\n                            # Uncomment for debugging (will print the Arrow table size and elements)\n                            # logger.warning(f\"pa_table: {pa_table} num rows: {pa_table.num_rows}\")\n                            # logger.warning('\\n'.join(str(pa_table.slice(i, 1).to_pydict()) for i in range(pa_table.num_rows)))\n                            yield f\"{file_idx}_{batch_idx}\", self._cast_table(pa_table)\n```\nCritical Details: Added sorting logic that uses PyArrow's sort_by method and includes error handling to avoid breaking the stream if sorting fails\n\n### Step 3: Add validation for sort_by parameter in __post_init__\nFile: `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 24 (after super().__post_init__())\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```\n    def __post_init__(self):\n        super().__post_init__()\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n    def __post_init__(self):\n        super().__post_init__()\n        if self.sort_by is not None and not isinstance(self.sort_by, str):\n            raise ValueError(\"sort_by must be a string or None\")\n```\nCritical Details: Added validation to ensure sort_by is either a string or None, maintaining type safety\n\n### Step 4: Update docstring for ParquetConfig\nFile: `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 17 (after class definition)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```\n@dataclass\nclass ParquetConfig(datasets.BuilderConfig):\n    \"\"\"BuilderConfig for Parquet.\"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```\n@dataclass\nclass ParquetConfig(datasets.BuilderConfig):\n    \"\"\"BuilderConfig for Parquet.\n\n    Args:\n        batch_size: Number of rows to read at a time.\n        columns: List of columns to read from the parquet file.\n        features: Features to use for the dataset.\n        sort_by: Column name to sort by during streaming. If None, no sorting is performed.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Updated the docstring to document the new sort_by parameter\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "action": "system", "args": {"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Additionally, a new `filters` configuration parameter has been introduced, enabling predicate pushdown when reading Parquet files. This feature allows users to filter data on the fly, reducing the amount of data read into memory and improving query efficiency.\n\nFor example, you can filter a dataset by specific column values as shown below:\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nfilters = [('problem_source', '==', 'math')]\nds = load_dataset(\"nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2\", streaming=True, filters=filters)\nfirst_example = next(iter(ds[\"train\"]))\nprint(first_example[\"problem_source\"])\n# 'math'\n```\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nStreaming data from Parquet files can be slow, especially for large datasets. Additionally, applying filters while loading data was not natively supported, which resulted in unnecessary data being loaded into memory.\n\n**Solution**:\n* Implement faster Parquet streaming using a buffered stream to enhance data reading performance.\n* Introduce the `filters` configuration parameter to support predicate pushdown, which applies filters directly during data reading, reducing memory usage and speeding up data loading.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Parquet streaming is slow and lacks filtering capability. Users cannot apply predicates during data reading, resulting in unnecessary data loading into memory.\nGoal: Implement faster Parquet streaming using buffered streams and add predicate pushdown filtering capability.\nRequirements: \n- Add buffered stream for faster Parquet reading (approximately 2x speed improvement)\n- Add filters parameter to enable predicate pushdown when reading Parquet files\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Support standard filter syntax like [('column', 'operator', 'value')]\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I will own entirely `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature is separate from parquet functionality\nShared File Strategy: No shared files - I'm working exclusively on the parquet module\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The implementation modifies the existing Parquet class in the packaged_modules/parquet module to:\n1. Accept a new 'filters' parameter in the config\n2. Use buffered streams for faster reading\n3.

Additionally, a new `filters` configuration parameter has been introduced, enabling predicate pushdown when reading Parquet files. This feature allows users to filter data on the fly, reducing the amount of data read into memory and improving query efficiency.\n\nFor example, you can filter a dataset by specific column values as shown below:\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nfilters = [('problem_source', '==', 'math')]\nds = load_dataset(\"nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2\", streaming=True, filters=filters)\nfirst_example = next(iter(ds[\"train\"]))\nprint(first_example[\"problem_source\"])\n# 'math'\n```\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nStreaming data from Parquet files can be slow, especially for large datasets. Additionally, applying filters while loading data was not natively supported, which resulted in unnecessary data being loaded into memory.\n\n**Solution**:\n* Implement faster Parquet streaming using a buffered stream to enhance data reading performance.\n* Introduce the `filters` configuration parameter to support predicate pushdown, which applies filters directly during data reading, reducing memory usage and speeding up data loading.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Parquet streaming is slow and lacks filtering capability. Users cannot apply predicates during data reading, resulting in unnecessary data loading into memory.\nGoal: Implement faster Parquet streaming using buffered streams and add predicate pushdown filtering capability.\nRequirements: \n- Add buffered stream for faster Parquet reading (approximately 2x speed improvement)\n- Add filters parameter to enable predicate pushdown when reading Parquet files\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Support standard filter syntax like [('column', 'operator', 'value')]\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I will own entirely `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature is separate from parquet functionality\nShared File Strategy: No shared files - I'm working exclusively on the parquet module\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The implementation modifies the existing Parquet class in the packaged_modules/parquet module to:\n1.

Users cannot apply predicates during data reading, resulting in unnecessary data loading into memory.\nGoal: Implement faster Parquet streaming using buffered streams and add predicate pushdown filtering capability.\nRequirements: \n- Add buffered stream for faster Parquet reading (approximately 2x speed improvement)\n- Add filters parameter to enable predicate pushdown when reading Parquet files\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Support standard filter syntax like [('column', 'operator', 'value')]\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I will own entirely `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature is separate from parquet functionality\nShared File Strategy: No shared files - I'm working exclusively on the parquet module\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The implementation modifies the existing Parquet class in the packaged_modules/parquet module to:\n1. Accept a new 'filters' parameter in the config\n2. Use buffered streams for faster reading\n3. Apply filters during Parquet file iteration via predicate pushdown\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n- The filters parameter should be optional and default to None\n- Buffering will be implemented at the file reading level\n- Filter syntax follows standard conventions: [('column', 'operator', 'value')]\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify ParquetConfig dataclass to add filters parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nLocation: Lines 15-25 (after batch_size and columns definitions)\nAction: Add filters attribute to ParquetConfig\nBefore Code:\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass ParquetConfig(datasets.BuilderConfig):\n    \"\"\"BuilderConfig for Parquet.\"\"\"\n\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n\n    def __post_init__(self):\n        super().__post_init__()\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass ParquetConfig(datasets.BuilderConfig):\n    \"\"\"BuilderConfig for Parquet.\"\"\"\n\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n    filters: Optional[List[tuple]] = None\n\n    def __post_init__(self):\n        super().__post_init__()\n```\nCritical Details: Added filters parameter with type hint List[tuple] and default value None\n\n### Step 2: Update _generate_tables method to support buffering and filtering\nFile: `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\nLocation: Lines 74-97 (entire _generate_tables method)\nAction: Replace method to implement buffered reading and filter application\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def _generate_tables(self, files):\n        if self.config.features is not None and self.config.columns is not None:\n            if sorted(field.name for field in self.info.features.arrow_schema) != sorted(self.config.columns):\n                raise ValueError(\n                    f\"Tried to load parquet data with columns '{self.config.columns}' with mismatching features '{self.info.features}'\"\n                )\n        for file_idx, file in enumerate(itertools.chain.from_iterable(files)):\n            with open(file, \"rb\") as f:\n                parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile(f)\n                if parquet_file.metadata.num_row_groups > 0:\n                    batch_size = self.config.batch_size or parquet_file.metadata.row_group(0).num_rows\n                    try:\n                        for batch_idx, record_batch in enumerate(\n                            parquet_file.iter_batches(batch_size=batch_size, columns=self.config.columns)\n                        ):\n                            pa_table = pa.Table.from_batches([record_batch])\n                            #

Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T19:21:50.005446", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:51937": 51937, "http://localhost:59000": 59000}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-12-07", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T19:21:54.020692", "source": "agent", "message": "Reading file: /workspace/src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py", "action": "read", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-12293ccb62b048a590f8416521423790", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-0974c578f69b49ad85c5f01b9e85db7a", "created": 1765135310, "model": "qwen3-coder", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I'll implement the sorting functionality for streaming parquet data as described in the feature plan.

Let me summarize what I've accomplished:\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nI've completed all four steps of the implementation plan:\n\n1. **Added `sort_by` parameter to `ParquetConfig` dataclass** (lines 29): Added the new parameter with default `None` value to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n2. **Enhanced the docstring** (lines 17-24): Updated documentation to describe the new `sort_by` parameter.\n\n3. **Added validation for `sort_by` parameter** (lines 33-34): Implemented type checking to ensure `sort_by` is either a string or None.\n\n4. **Modified `_generate_tables` method** (lines 100-105): Added sorting logic that uses PyArrow's `sort_by` method when the parameter is specified, with proper error handling to prevent stream interruption.\n\n## Key Features of the Implementation\n\n- **Backward Compatibility**: The new `sort_by` parameter defaults to `None`, so existing code continues to work unchanged\n- **Type Safety**: Added validation to ensure `sort_by` is properly typed\n- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of sorting failures with logging warnings\n- **Efficient Sorting**: Uses PyArrow's native sorting capabilities for performance\n- **Clear Documentation**: Updated docstring explains the new functionality\n\nThe implementation follows all requirements from the feature plan and integrates seamlessly with the existing parquet streaming functionality. The changes are minimal and focused, ensuring no disruption to existing functionality while adding the requested sorting capability.\n\n"}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 13, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T19:23:04.263013", "source": "agent", "message": "Perfect!
