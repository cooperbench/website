Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This approach maintains backward compatibility while adding the requested functionality.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- The function signature will be extended to accept a new optional parameter\n- The existing logic must remain unchanged for backward compatibility\n- The solution should be minimal and focused\n- Need to consider how this integrates with the Features class's usage of this function\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify the require_decoding function signature\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1181 (function definition)\nAction: Add new optional parameter for custom criteria\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False, custom_criteria=None) -> bool:\n```\nCritical Details: This is a simple signature modification that preserves all existing behavior while allowing for extension.\n\n### Step 2: Update the docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Lines 1182-1190 (docstring)\nAction: Add documentation for the new parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\n\"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n\"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n        custom_criteria (optional): Custom criteria to determine if decoding is required.\n            Can be a callable function that accepts a feature and returns a boolean,\n            or a metadata-based condition.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Clear documentation explaining the new parameter and its usage.\n\n### Step 3: Implement custom criteria logic in the function body\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Line 1198 (return statement)\nAction: Add logic to handle custom criteria\nBefore Code:\n```python\nelse:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nelse:\n        # Check custom criteria first if provided\n        if custom_criteria is not None:\n            # Handle callable criteria\n            if callable(custom_criteria):\n                try:\n                    return custom_criteria(feature)\n                except Exception:\n                    # Fall back to default behavior if custom criteria fails\n                    pass\n            # Handle metadata-based criteria (if it's a dict with metadata conditions)\n            elif isinstance(custom_criteria, dict):\n                # For now, we'll just fall through to default behavior for metadata-based criteria\n                # More sophisticated implementation can be added later\n                pass\n        \n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nCritical Details: The implementation handles callable custom criteria gracefully with exception handling, falling back to default behavior if the custom criteria fails. For metadata-based criteria, it currently falls through to default behavior but provides a framework for future expansion.\n\n### Step 4: Ensure Features class integration remains intact\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Lines 1236-1238 and 1242\nAction: Verify that existing usage patterns remain unaffected\nBefore Code:\n```python\nself._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {\n            col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()\n        }\n```\nAnd:\n```python\nself._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nAfter Code: No changes needed - these calls use default parameters so they'll work exactly as before.\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION\nThe implementation provides backward compatibility while extending functionality to support custom decoding criteria. The solution is minimal and focused, addressing the core requirement without disrupting existing code paths.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The caching mechanism stores results of decoding checks for each feature and reuses them for subsequent checks. This enhancement may impact the synchronization behavior in the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator, and adjustments have been made to accommodate this.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe `require_decoding` function recalculates decoding requirements each time it is called, which can result in unnecessary performance overhead, especially when called multiple times for the same features.\n\n**Solution**:\nA caching mechanism is introduced to store the results of decoding checks for features. This improves performance by reducing redundant calculations. Changes are also made to ensure compatibility with the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The `require_decoding` function recalculates decoding requirements each time it is called, resulting in unnecessary performance overhead, especially when called multiple times for the same features.\n\nGoal: Introduce a caching mechanism in the `require_decoding` function to improve performance by avoiding redundant recalculations of decoding requirements.\n\nRequirements: \n- Cache results of decoding checks for each feature\n- Reuse cached results for subsequent checks\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n- Handle synchronization issues with the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator appropriately\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire `src/datasets/features/features.py` file modification for this caching implementation\nOther Agent Handles: Custom criteria feature for require_decoding (separate implementation)\nShared File Strategy: We're modifying the same function but with different aspects - I'm adding caching, they're adding custom criteria\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: Using Python's functools.lru_cache decorator for efficient caching mechanism\nCritical Notes: Need to ensure cache doesn't interfere with the synchronization behavior in related decorators\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Import functools for caching\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 25 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add import\nBefore Code: \n```python\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n```\nCritical Details: Added lru_cache import right after other standard library imports\n\n### Step 2: Modify require_decoding function to add caching\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1181 (function definition)\nAction: Replace function with cached version\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n@lru_cache(maxsize=128)\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nCritical Details: Added @lru_cache(maxsize=128) decorator to cache results. The maxsize is chosen to balance memory usage and performance benefits. The function logic remains identical to preserve all existing behavior.\n\n### Step 3: Ensure proper cache invalidation handling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: End of file (around line 1523)\nAction: Add cache clearing method to Features class if needed\nBefore Code: [No specific code to modify here]\nAfter Code: [No changes needed as lru_cache handles automatic cache management]\nCritical Details: The lru_cache decorator automatically manages cache lifecycle, including eviction based on maxsize, so no explicit cache clearing is necessary for this implementation.\n\n### Step 4: Update docstring to mention caching behavior\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1182 (function docstring)\nAction: Update docstring to reflect caching behavior\nBefore Code:\n```python\n\"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n\"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    This function uses caching to avoid redundant calculations. Results are cached based on\n    the feature object and ignore_decode_attribute parameter.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Enhanced documentation to inform users about the caching behavior and how it affects performance.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_3 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.
