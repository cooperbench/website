Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nHigh-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\nGoal: Introduce an optional `max_resolution` parameter to the `Image` feature that automatically clamps image dimensions during decoding to prevent memory issues.\n\nRequirements: \n- Add optional `max_resolution` parameter to Image class constructor\n- When an image exceeds the specified width or height, downscale proportionally using PIL's thumbnail method\n- Maintain aspect ratio during resizing\n- Only apply resizing when decode=True\n- Preserve backward compatibility\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own entirely src/datasets/features/image.py\nOther Agent Handles: Their separate feature (unknown at this time)\nShared File Strategy: No shared files - I'll implement exclusively in the Image feature file\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class already has a decode_example method that processes images. I'll extend this method to optionally apply resizing based on the new parameter.\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to handle the case where max_resolution is None (default behavior)\n- Need to check if PIL is available before using thumbnail method\n- Should maintain existing functionality when max_resolution is not specified\n- Will use PIL's thumbnail method which modifies images in-place\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely \nLocation: Line 84 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing parameters, keeping same indentation and style\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 67 (after decode parameter documentation)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        max_resolution (`int`, *optional*):\n            Maximum image resolution in pixels (width or height). If specified, images larger than this\n            resolution will be downsampled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining\n            aspect ratio. If `None`, no resizing is applied.\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing parameter docs, consistent formatting\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to handle max_resolution\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 155 (before returning the image)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply max resolution clamping if specified\n        if self.max_resolution is not None and self.max_resolution > 0:\n            # Use PIL's thumbnail method which modifies the image in-place\n            # and maintains aspect ratio\n            image.thumbnail((self.max_resolution, self.max_resolution), resample=PIL.Image.LANCZOS)\n        \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added before the final return statement, imported PIL if needed, used LANCZOS resampling for quality\n\n### Step 4: Add necessary PIL import check\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 145 (in decode_example method)\nAction: Add import check\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n        \n        # Check if max_resolution is specified and PIL is available for resizing\n        if self.max_resolution is not None and self.max_resolution > 0 and not config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support max_resolution parameter, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nCritical Details: Added validation to ensure PIL is available when max_resolution is used\n\n### Step 5: Import PIL in the module-level section (if not already present)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 19 (module imports)\nAction: Verify/Update imports\nBefore Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n\n    from .features import FeatureType\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n\n    from .features import FeatureType\n```\nCritical Details: No change needed since PIL is already imported in TYPE_CHECKING block\n\n### Step 6: Update the class docstring examples to include max_resolution\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 78 (after existing example)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> # Resize images to maximum 512 pixels in width or height\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=True, max_resolution=512))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"].size\n    (512, 341)  # Resized while maintaining aspect ratio\n    ```\nCritical Details: Added example showing usage with max_resolution parameter\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "action": "system", "args": {"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\nThe goal is to implement a user authentication system with token-based authentication. This includes creating endpoints for user registration, login, and protected routes that require valid tokens. The system should generate secure JWT tokens upon successful login and validate these tokens for protected routes. Requirements include secure password hashing, token expiration, and proper error handling.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Use Flask for web framework\n- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication\n- Use bcrypt for password hashing\n- Store users in-memory (for simplicity, can be extended to database)\n- Create three main routes: /register, /login, /protected\n- Protected route requires valid Authorization header with Bearer token\n- Token expiry set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)\n- All code will be in single file for simplicity\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Set up basic Flask app structure\nFile: `app.py`\nLocation: Beginning of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none -

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\nThe goal is to implement a user authentication system with token-based authentication. This includes creating endpoints for user registration, login, and protected routes that require valid tokens. The system should generate secure JWT tokens upon successful login and validate these tokens for protected routes. Requirements include secure password hashing, token expiration, and proper error handling.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- Use Flask for web framework\n- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication\n- Use bcrypt for password hashing\n- Store users in-memory (for simplicity, can be extended to database)\n- Create three main routes: /register, /login, /protected\n- Protected route requires valid Authorization header with Bearer token\n- Token expiry set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)\n- All code will be in single file for simplicity\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Max 8 steps)\n\n### Step 1: Set up basic Flask app structure\nFile: `app.py`\nLocation: Beginning of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none -
