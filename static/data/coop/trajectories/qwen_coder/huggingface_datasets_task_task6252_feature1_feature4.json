Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Users need to remove border artifacts (watermarks, framing) from images in datasets, requiring manual post-processing that adds overhead.\nGoal: Add optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature to automatically crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge during decoding.\nRequirements: \n- New parameter `crop_margin` (int, optional) that specifies pixels to crop from each side\n- Should work with existing image decoding pipeline\n- Should maintain backward compatibility\n- Should only apply cropping when crop_margin > 0\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own entirely `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOther Agent Handles: EXIF orientation correction in the same file\nShared File Strategy: We'll both modify `decode_example` method but with different logic:\n- My changes: Add crop_margin functionality to decode_example method\n- Their changes: Add EXIF orientation correction to decode_example method\nWe'll coordinate on placement to avoid conflicts\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class follows a standard pattern where `__init__` sets up parameters and `decode_example` processes the image data. The crop functionality will be added to the decode_example method after image loading but before returning.\nCritical Notes: Need to ensure PIL.Image import is available, handle edge cases where crop_margin exceeds image dimensions, maintain existing functionality when crop_margin is not specified.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class __init__\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add crop_margin parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added after existing parameters, default None to maintain backward compatibility\n\n### Step 2: Import PIL.ImageOps for image operations\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 16 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add PIL.ImageOps import\nBefore Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n\n    from .features import FeatureType\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n\n    from .features import FeatureType\n\n# For image operations like cropping\ntry:\n    import PIL.ImageOps\nexcept ImportError:\n    PIL.ImageOps = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added import guard to maintain compatibility\n\n### Step 3: Add cropping logic to decode_example method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely  \nLocation: Line 190 (before return statement)\nAction: Add crop logic after mode conversion\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply cropping if crop_margin is specified\n        if self.crop_margin is not None and self.crop_margin > 0:\n            width, height = image.size\n            left = self.crop_margin\n            upper = self.crop_margin\n            right = width - self.crop_margin\n            lower = height - self.crop_margin\n            \n            # Ensure crop coordinates are valid\n            if left >= right or upper >= lower:\n                raise ValueError(f\"crop_margin {self.crop_margin} is too large for image size {width}x{height}\")\n            \n            image = image.crop((left, upper, right, lower))\n        \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added validation to prevent invalid crops, placed before return statement, handles edge cases appropriately\n\n### Step 4: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Lines 62-68 (in the docstring)\nAction: Add documentation for crop_margin parameter\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected when loaded via PIL, leading to inconsistent image orientations that cause issues in tasks like object detection or layout modeling.\n\nGoal: Implement automatic EXIF orientation correction by applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during image decoding, ensuring consistent image orientation regardless of EXIF metadata.\n\nRequirements: \n- Integrate EXIF correction seamlessly into existing image decoding workflow\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Only apply correction when EXIF orientation data is present\n- Handle all image loading paths (from file, from bytes, from streaming)\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own `src/datasets/features/image.py` entirely for this feature\nOther Agent Handles: Border cropping functionality in the same file (will modify `__init__` and `decode_example`)\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate line placement in `decode_example` method to avoid conflicts\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The implementation will extend the existing `decode_example` method in the `Image` class to check for EXIF orientation data and apply automatic correction using PIL's `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` function.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to import `PIL.ImageOps` at the top of the file\n- EXIF correction should happen after image loading but before mode conversion\n- Should only apply correction when EXIF data is present to maintain performance\n- Must preserve all existing functionality and error handling\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add PIL.ImageOps import to the imports section\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 19 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add import for PIL.ImageOps\nBefore Code: \n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\n\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add EXIF orientation correction logic to decode_example method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely \nLocation: Line 188 (after image.load() and before mode conversion)\nAction: Insert EXIF correction logic\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\n\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        \n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if present\n        try:\n            # Check if image has EXIF data and orientation tag\n            if hasattr(image, '_getexif') and image._getexif() is not None:\n                exif = image._getexif()\n                if exif is not None and 270 in exif:\n                    # Apply EXIF orientation correction\n                    from PIL import ImageOps\n                    image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n        except Exception:\n            # If there's any issue with EXIF processing, continue without correction\n            pass\n            \n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\n\nCritical Details: \n- Added try-except block to ensure EXIF processing errors don't break the entire pipeline\n- Used `hasattr(image, '_getexif')` to safely check for EXIF availability\n- Applied correction using `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` which is the standard PIL method\n- Positioned the EXIF correction right after image loading but before mode conversion\n- Maintained all existing error handling and functionality\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.
