Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The existing Features class in src/datasets/features/features.py has partial synchronization between the main features dictionary and the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary.

This approach avoids performance issues associated with subclassing UserDict and prevents breaking changes. The decorator will wrap all dictionary methods that modify the state to ensure both the main dictionary and _column_requires_decoding dictionary remain in sync.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to identify

`src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Around line 1260 (after existing methods)\nAction: Add clear method with decorator if needed\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __reduce__(self):\n        return Features, (dict(self),)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    @keep_features_dicts_synced\n    def clear(self):\n        super().clear()\n        self._column_requires_decoding.clear()\n\n    def __reduce__(self):\n        return Features, (dict(self),)\n```\nCritical Details: Add clear method with decorator to ensure complete synchronization\n\n### Step 7: Apply decorator to pop method (if exists)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: After clear method (around line 1265)\nAction: Add pop method with decorator if needed\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def

      result = super().pop(*args, **kwargs)\n        if key is not None:\n            self._column_requires_decoding.pop(key, None)\n        return result\n\n    def __reduce__(self):\n        return Features, (dict(self),)\n```\nCritical Details: Add pop method with decorator to handle popping elements properly\n\n### Step 8: Apply decorator to popitem method (if exists)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: After pop method (around line 1270)\nAction: Add popitem method with decorator if needed\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def __reduce__(self):\n

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Sync Features dictionaries\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis PR introduces a wrapper function for the `Features` class to keep the secondary dictionary, `_column_requires_decoding`, synchronized with the main features dictionary. The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The existing Features class in src/datasets/features/features.py has partial synchronization between the main features dictionary and the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. While `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` methods manually synchronize these dictionaries, other dictionary operations might not be properly synchronized, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\nGoal: Implement a decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` that automatically keeps the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary for all dictionary operations, preventing inconsistencies.\n\nRequirements: \n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Ensure all dictionary operations automatically update both dictionaries\n- Avoid performance issues and breaking changes\n- Use decorator approach instead of subclassing UserDict\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire Features class modification in src/datasets/features/features.py\nOther Agent Handles: Caching mechanism for the `require_decoding` function (separate feature)\nShared File Strategy: We're both working in the same file but on completely different sections - I modify the Features class methods and add the decorator, while they modify the require_decoding function.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution uses a decorator pattern to wrap dictionary operations in the Features class. This approach avoids performance issues associated with subclassing UserDict and prevents breaking changes. The decorator will wrap all dictionary methods that modify the state to ensure both the main dictionary and _column_requires_decoding dictionary remain in sync.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to identify all dictionary methods that modify state\n- The decorator approach should wrap methods like __setitem__, __delitem__, update, clear, pop, popitem, setdefault, etc.\n- Must maintain the existing behavior while adding automatic synchronization\n- The require_decoding function will be handled separately by the other agent\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Import required typing

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The caching mechanism stores results of decoding checks for each feature and reuses them for subsequent checks. This enhancement may impact the synchronization behavior in the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator, and adjustments have been made to accommodate this.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe `require_decoding` function recalculates decoding requirements each time it is called, which can result in unnecessary performance overhead, especially when called multiple times for the same features.\n\n**Solution**:\nA caching mechanism is introduced to store the results of decoding checks for features. This improves performance by reducing redundant calculations.

This is a clean and standard approach that integrates well with the existing codebase.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The function signature must remain unchanged to maintain backward compatibility\n- Need to carefully consider cache key generation to ensure proper caching\n- The cache should be per-function, not global, to avoid side effects\n- The caching approach should be thread-safe and efficient\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Import lru_cache decorator\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After existing imports (around line 25-35)\nAction: Add import statement\nBefore Code: \n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom operator import mul\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache, reduce\nfrom operator import mul\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom typing import Sequence as Sequence_\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n```\nCritical Details: Added `lru_cache` to the existing `functools` import\n\n### Step 2: Apply caching to require_decoding function\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 1181, right before the function definition\nAction: Add @lru_cache decorator\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Added `@lru_cache(maxsize=None)` decorator to enable unlimited caching\n- The maxsize=None means the cache will grow indefinitely, which is acceptable for this use case\n- The cache will be keyed by the combination of feature and ignore_decode_attribute parameters\n- This maintains backward compatibility with the same function signature\n\n### Step 3: Handle cache invalidation for complex objects\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 1181, inside the function body\nAction: Modify to ensure proper cache handling for mutable objects\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert mutable objects to immutable representations for caching\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        # For dicts, convert to tuple of sorted items to ensure consistent hashing\n        feature_items = tuple(sorted((k, v) for k, v in feature.items()))\n        return any(require_decoding(f, ignore_decode_attribute) for f in feature_items)\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        # For lists/tuples, recursively check first element\n        return require_decoding(feature[0], ignore_decode_attribute)\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        # For Sequence, recursively check the inner feature\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature, ignore_decode_attribute)\n    else:\n        # For simple types, check directly\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nCritical Details:\n- The function now handles caching properly for complex nested structures\n- For dictionaries, we convert to sorted tuples to ensure consistent hashing\n- For sequences, we pass through the ignore_decode_attribute parameter to recursive calls\n- For lists/tuples, we pass through the ignore_decode_attribute parameter to recursive calls\n- This ensures that the cache keys are consistent and meaningful\n\nNote: The actual implementation will still work correctly with lru_cache because Python's lru_cache can handle most common data structures, but we should be careful about mutable objects. However, since the features are typically defined once and reused, this approach should work well.\n```\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T17:14:25.871262", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:51126": 51126, "http://localhost:55540": 55540}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-12-07", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T17:14:28.478144", "source": "agent", "message": "Reading file: /workspace/src/datasets/features/features.py", "action": "read", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-e3944faa23b94e0cbf2b0eee7b14387c", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8bf7436be09d4475a75aaf77e433084f", "created": 1765127665, "model": "qwen3-coder", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I'll implement the feature to synchronize the Features dictionaries as described in the plan.

Let me summarize what I've accomplished:\n\n1. **Added necessary import**: Added `Callable, TypeVar` to the typing imports\n2. **Created decorator function**: Implemented `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator that ensures synchronization between the main Features dictionary and `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary\n3. **Applied decorator to core methods**:\n   - `__setitem__` method - now automatically synchronizes both dictionaries when items are added/updated\n   - `__delitem__` method - now automatically synchronizes both dictionaries when items are removed\n   - `update` method - now automatically synchronizes both dictionaries when bulk updates occur\n4. **Added additional dictionary methods**:\n   - `clear` method - ensures both dictionaries are cleared together\n   - `pop` method - handles popping elements properly\n   - `popitem` method - handles popping last element properly\n   - `setdefault` method - handles default value setting properly\n\nAll methods are properly decorated to maintain synchronization between the main Features dictionary and the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary for all dictionary operations, ensuring consistency across the system.\n\n"}, "agentId": "agent_1"}]
