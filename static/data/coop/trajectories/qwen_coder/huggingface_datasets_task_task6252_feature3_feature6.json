Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The decode_example method is where image processing occurs and is the ideal place to apply the resizing logic.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to add proper imports for PIL.Image in decode_example if not already present\n- Will use Pillow's thumbnail() method for proportional resizing\n- max_resolution should accept a tuple of (width, height) or single integer for square constraint\n- Should maintain backward compatibility by defaulting to None\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 86 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Added the parameter with proper type hints and default value of None for backward compatibility\n\n### Step 2: Modify decode_example method to apply max_resolution resizing\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely  \nLocation: Line 190 (before return statement)\nAction: Add resizing logic\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply max_resolution clamping if specified\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            # Handle both single integer (square) and tuple formats\n            if isinstance(self.max_resolution, int):\n                max_width, max_height = self.max_resolution, self.max_resolution\n            else:\n                max_width, max_height = self.max_resolution\n            \n            # Check if image exceeds max resolution and resize if needed\n            if image.width > max_width or image.height > max_height:\n                # Use thumbnail method to maintain aspect ratio\n                image.thumbnail((max_width, max_height), PIL.Image.LANCZOS)\n        \n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Added import check for PIL.Image (already handled in existing code)\n- Used PIL.Image.LANCZOS for high-quality resampling\n- Implemented proper handling for both integer (square) and tuple formats\n- Applied resizing only when needed to avoid unnecessary processing\n- Maintained the original return statement\n\n### Step 3: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 67 (after existing parameter documentation)\nAction: Add documentation for max_resolution\nBefore Code:\n```python\n     Args:\n         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n             The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n         decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n             Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n             returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n     Args:\n         mode (`str`, *optional*):\n             The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n         decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n             Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n             returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n         max_resolution (`int` or `tuple`, *optional*):\n             Maximum resolution (width, height) for the decoded image. If the image exceeds\n             these dimensions, it will be downscaled proportionally to fit within the limits.\n             If an integer is provided, it will be used for both width and height.\n```\nCritical Details: Added comprehensive documentation matching the existing style\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This maintains consistency with existing code patterns where image.mode is checked and converted.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to handle PIL import properly (it's currently imported locally in decode_example)\n- The conversion should happen early in the process, right after loading but before any mode-specific operations\n- Should preserve all existing functionality and error handling\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add CMYK conversion logic in decode_example method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own this section entirely\nLocation: Line 188-191 (after image.load() and before mode conversion)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # Convert CMYK images to RGB to ensure downstream compatibility\n        if image.mode == \"CMYK\":\n            image = image.convert(\"RGB\")\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Added the CMYK detection and conversion right after image.load() but before any existing mode conversion logic. This ensures CMYK images are converted to RGB before any other processing.\n\n### Step 2: Ensure PIL import is available at module level (if needed)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own this section entirely\nLocation: Lines 1-17 (top of file)\nAction: Check and potentially add import\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n```\nCritical Details: This ensures PIL is properly imported for type checking. Note that PIL is imported locally in decode_example, but for consistency and potential future use, we keep the type checking import.\n\n### Step 3: Add documentation for the CMYK conversion behavior\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own this section entirely\nLocation: Around line 62-65 (in the docstring for the Image class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            Note: CMYK images are automatically converted to RGB for downstream compatibility.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nCritical Details: Updated the docstring to document the automatic CMYK to RGB conversion behavior for users of the feature.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_6 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

This ensures CMYK images are converted to RGB before any other processing.\n\n### Step 2: Ensure PIL import is available at module level (if needed)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own this section entirely\nLocation: Lines 1-17 (top of file)\nAction: Check and potentially add import\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\nfrom .. import config\nfrom ..download.download_config import DownloadConfig\nfrom ..download.streaming_download_manager import xopen\nfrom ..table import array_cast\nfrom ..utils.file_utils import is_local_path\nfrom ..utils.py_utils import first_non_null_value, no_op_if_value_is_null, string_to_dict\n\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n```\nCritical Details: This ensures PIL is properly imported for type checking. Note that PIL is imported locally in decode_example, but for consistency and potential future use, we keep the type checking import.\n\n### Step 3: Add documentation for the CMYK conversion behavior\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own this section entirely\nLocation: Around line 62-65 (in the docstring for the Image class)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n            Note: CMYK images are automatically converted to RGB for downstream compatibility.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nCritical Details: Updated the docstring to document the automatic CMYK to RGB conversion behavior for users of the feature.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "file_urls": null, "image_urls": null, "wait_for_response": false}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 2, "timestamp": "2025-12-07T19:02:34.788003", "source": "user", "message": "Retrieving content for: You are agent_6 working on the following feature i", "action": "recall", "args": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "query": "You are agent_6 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.
