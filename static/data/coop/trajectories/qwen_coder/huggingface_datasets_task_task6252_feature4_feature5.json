Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Some datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\nGoal: Introduce an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature, allowing users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding.\n\nRequirements: \n- Add `crop_margin` parameter to Image class constructor\n- Modify `decode_example` method to apply cropping when crop_margin is specified\n- Use PIL's `crop()` method to remove uniform margin from all four sides\n- Maintain backward compatibility (default behavior unchanged)\n- Handle edge cases like negative margins or margins larger than image dimensions\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own the entire `src/datasets/features/image.py` file for implementing the crop_margin feature\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature (normalization to float32 NumPy arrays) will be implemented in the same file but in different sections\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate on the exact line numbers where we modify the Image class to avoid conflicts\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class will be extended with a new parameter that gets processed during image decoding. The cropping logic will be applied right after image loading but before mode conversion in the decode_example method.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- The crop_margin parameter should default to None to maintain backward compatibility\n- Crop margin should be validated to ensure it's non-negative integer\n- When crop_margin is applied, we crop from all four edges equally (top, bottom, left, right)\n- The cropping operation uses PIL's crop() method with coordinates (left, upper, right, lower)\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely \nLocation: Line 84 (after existing parameters)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Place right after the existing parameters, maintain same indentation and style\n\n### Step 2: Modify decode_example method to handle crop_margin\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 190 (before returning image)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.crop_margin is not None:\n            # Apply cropping to remove margin from all sides\n            margin = int(self.crop_margin)\n            if margin < 0:\n                raise ValueError(f\"crop_margin must be non-negative, got {margin}\")\n            width, height = image.size\n            if margin * 2 >= min(width, height):\n                raise ValueError(f\"crop_margin {margin} is too large for image of size {width}x{height}\")\n            left = margin\n            upper = margin\n            right = width - margin\n            lower = height - margin\n            image = image.crop((left, upper, right, lower))\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Add the cropping logic right before the mode conversion, validate margin values, and ensure proper type conversion\n\n### Step 3: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 62 (in the docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Many machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\nGoal: Introduce support for normalizing image pixel values by converting them into a `float32` NumPy array scaled to the range [0, 1], controlled by a new `as_array` flag in the `Image` feature.\n\nRequirements: \n- Add `as_array` parameter to Image feature constructor\n- When `as_array=True`, decoded images should be converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PIL Image behavior\n- Enable direct NumPy array usage in downstream ML pipelines\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own `src/datasets/features/image.py` entirely for my implementation\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature (image border cropping with `crop_margin` parameter)\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate on line modifications in the same file. They'll modify constructor and decoding logic for cropping; I'll modify constructor and decoding logic for array conversion.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class already has a `decode_example` method that handles the core image processing logic. My changes will extend this to support NumPy array output when requested. The feature maintains backward compatibility by defaulting to PIL Image behavior.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to handle both PIL Image objects and raw bytes/paths appropriately\n- When converting to arrays, ensure proper scaling to [0, 1] range\n- Must maintain proper dtype handling for NumPy arrays\n- Should integrate cleanly with existing feature type system\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    as_array: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Add the parameter with default False to maintain backward compatibility\n\n### Step 2: Import necessary modules for NumPy handling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 8 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nCritical Details: No changes needed here as numpy is already imported\n\n### Step 3: Modify the decode_example method to handle as_array conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 140 (in the decode_example method)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict) -> Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray]:\n        \"\"\"Decode example from Arrow format to image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Data to decode.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image` or `np.ndarray`:\n                Decoded image.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.decode:\n            return value\n        try:\n            import PIL.Image\n        except ImportError as err:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'PIL'.\") from err\n        if \"bytes\" in value and value[\"bytes\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(value[\"bytes\"]))\n        elif \"path\" in value and value[\"path\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(value[\"path\"])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Image data must contain either 'bytes' or 'path'\")\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict) -> Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray]:\n        \"\"\"Decode example from Arrow format to image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Data to decode.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image` or `np.ndarray`:\n                Decoded image.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.decode:\n            return value\n        try:\n            import PIL.Image\n        except ImportError as err:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'PIL'.\") from err\n        if \"bytes\" in value and value[\"bytes\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(value[\"bytes\"]))\n        elif \"path\" in value and value[\"path\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(value[\"path\"])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Image data must contain either 'bytes' or 'path'\")\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        if self.as_array:\n            # Convert to numpy array and normalize to [0, 1]\n            image_array = np.array(image)\n            # Normalize to [0, 1] range\n            if image_array.dtype != np.float32:\n                image_array = image_array.astype(np.float32) / 255.0\n            return image_array\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Added conditional check for `self.as_array`\n- When as_array=True, convert PIL image to numpy array using `np.array(image)`\n- Normalize to [0, 1] range by dividing by 255.0\n- Ensure float32 dtype for consistency\n- Preserve original behavior when as_array=False\n\n### Step 4: Update the docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 62 (in the docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data.

Let me revise this approach.\n\n### Step 6: Fix the dtype assignment issue (revised approach)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 87 (the dtype class variable)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n```\nCritical Details: Actually, I need to reconsider how to properly handle the dtype. Looking at the code more carefully, this is a class variable that doesn't depend on instance parameters. The dtype represents the expected return type, but since this is a class variable and can vary by instance, we might need a different approach. However, for simplicity and maintaining compatibility, I'll leave the dtype as is since it's a class variable that describes the general type. The actual return type will be determined at runtime based on the instance's as_array setting.\n\n### Step 7: Add comprehensive example to docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 81 (end of examples section)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> # Using as_array=True to get normalized NumPy arrays\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(as_array=True))\n    >>> array = ds[0][\"image\"]\n    >>> array.shape\n    (500, 500, 3)\n    >>> array.dtype\n    dtype('float32')\n    >>> array.min(), array.max()\n    (0.0, 1.0)\n    ```\n```\nCritical Details: Added a comprehensive example showing the new functionality with as_array=True\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Let me revise this approach.\n\n### Step 6: Fix the dtype assignment issue (revised approach)\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 87 (the dtype class variable)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    # Automatically constructed\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n```\nCritical Details: Actually, I need to reconsider how to properly handle the dtype. Looking at the code more carefully, this is a class variable that doesn't depend on instance parameters. The dtype represents the expected return type, but since this is a class variable and can vary by instance, we might need a different approach. However, for simplicity and maintaining compatibility, I'll leave the dtype as is since it's a class variable that describes the general type. The actual return type will be determined at runtime based on the instance's as_array setting.\n\n### Step 7: Add comprehensive example to docstring\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 81 (end of examples section)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> # Using as_array=True to get normalized NumPy arrays\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(as_array=True))\n    >>> array = ds[0][\"image\"]\n    >>> array.shape\n    (500, 500, 3)\n    >>> array.dtype\n    dtype('float32')\n    >>> array.min(), array.max()\n    (0.0, 1.0)\n    ```\n```\nCritical Details: Added a comprehensive example showing the new functionality with as_array=True\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Many machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\nGoal: Introduce support for normalizing image pixel values by converting them into a `float32` NumPy array scaled to the range [0, 1], controlled by a new `as_array` flag in the `Image` feature.\n\nRequirements: \n- Add `as_array` parameter to Image feature constructor\n- When `as_array=True`, decoded images should be converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PIL Image behavior\n- Enable direct NumPy array usage in downstream ML pipelines\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: I own `src/datasets/features/image.py` entirely for my implementation\nOther Agent Handles: Their feature (image border cropping with `crop_margin` parameter)\nShared File Strategy: We'll coordinate on line modifications in the same file. They'll modify constructor and decoding logic for cropping; I'll modify constructor and decoding logic for array conversion.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature class already has a `decode_example` method that handles the core image processing logic. My changes will extend this to support NumPy array output when requested. The feature maintains backward compatibility by defaulting to PIL Image behavior.\n\nCritical Notes: \n- Need to handle both PIL Image objects and raw bytes/paths appropriately\n- When converting to arrays, ensure proper scaling to [0, 1] range\n- Must maintain proper dtype handling for NumPy arrays\n- Should integrate cleanly with existing feature type system\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 84 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    as_array: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Add the parameter with default False to maintain backward compatibility\n\n### Step 2: Import necessary modules for NumPy handling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 8 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nCritical Details: No changes needed here as numpy is already imported\n\n### Step 3: Modify the decode_example method to handle as_array conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 140 (in the decode_example method)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict) -> Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray]:\n        \"\"\"Decode example from Arrow format to image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Data to decode.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image` or `np.ndarray`:\n                Decoded image.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.decode:\n            return value\n        try:\n            import PIL.Image\n        except ImportError as err:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'PIL'.\") from err\n        if \"bytes\" in value and value[\"bytes\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(value[\"bytes\"]))\n        elif \"path\" in value and value[\"path\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(value[\"path\"])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Image data must contain either 'bytes' or 'path'\")\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict) -> Union[\"PIL.Image.Image\", np.ndarray]:\n        \"\"\"Decode example from Arrow format to image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Data to decode.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image` or `np.ndarray`:\n                Decoded image.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.decode:\n            return value\n        try:\n            import PIL.Image\n        except ImportError as err:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'PIL'.\") from err\n        if \"bytes\" in value and value[\"bytes\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(value[\"bytes\"]))\n        elif \"path\" in value and value[\"path\"] is not None:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(value[\"path\"])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Image data must contain either 'bytes' or 'path'\")\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        if self.as_array:\n            # Convert to numpy array and normalize to [0, 1]\n            image_array = np.array(image)\n            # Normalize to [0, 1] range\n            if image_array.dtype != np.float32:\n                image_array = image_array.astype(np.float32) / 255.0\n            return image_array\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Added conditional check for `self.as_array`\n- When as_array=True, convert PIL image to numpy array using `np.array(image)`\n- Normalize to [0, 1] range by dividing by 255.0\n- Ensure float32 dtype for consistency\n- Preserve original behavior when as_array=False\n\n### Step 4: Update the docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Around line 62 (in the docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Here's a summary of what I've accomplished:\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\n### 1. Added `crop_margin` Parameter to Image Class\n- **File**: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n- **Location**: Constructor parameters (line 87)\n- **Change**: Added `crop_margin: Optional[int] = None` parameter\n- **Result**: Maintains backward compatibility with default `None` value\n\n### 2. Updated Documentation\n- **File**: `src/datasets/features/image.py` \n- **Location**: Docstring (lines 62-71)\n- **Change**: Added comprehensive documentation for the new parameter\n- **Details**: Explained usage with example `crop_margin=10` to remove 10px from each side\n\n### 3. Implemented Cropping Logic\n- **File**: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n- **Location**: `decode_example` method (lines 194-206)\n- **Features**:\n  - Validates that crop_margin is non-negative\n  - Checks that crop_margin isn't too large for the image dimensions\n  - Uses PIL's `crop()` method to remove uniform margin from all four sides\n  - Applies cropping before mode conversion for consistency\n\n### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests\n- **File**: `tests/features/test_image.py`\n- **Tests Added**:\n  - `test_image_crop_margin`: Tests basic functionality, different margin sizes, and backward compatibility\n  - `test_image_crop_margin_validation`: Tests error conditions (negative margins, oversized margins)\n  - Enhanced `test_image_instantiation`: Verifies crop_margin parameter is properly stored\n\n## Key Features\n- **Backward Compatible**: Default behavior unchanged when `crop_margin=None`\n- **Robust Error Handling**: Validates inputs and prevents invalid cropping operations\n- **Efficient Implementation**: Cropping happens during decoding, reducing post-processing overhead\n- **Flexible Usage**: Works with any positive integer margin value\n\nThe implementation follows the exact specification provided and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
