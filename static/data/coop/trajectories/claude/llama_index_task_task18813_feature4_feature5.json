Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

By eliminating extraneous padding, this enhancement ensures that buffer size calculations are accurate and that consumers of the audio data work with a clean, byte-exact representation. This reduces inconsistencies during testing and improves interoperability with systems that rely on precise buffer contents.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nCurrently, audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio_with_size()` may contain unintended null padding at the beginning or end of the stream. This can lead to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, or unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders or file writers expecting tightly packed data.\n\n**Solution**\nThe implementation trims leading and trailing `b'\\x00'` bytes from the raw audio buffer after resolution and before computing its size. This ensures that only meaningful audio data is returned, leading to more deterministic behavior and preventing false negatives in tests that compare buffer contents directly.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n\n**Problem**: Audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio()` may contain unintended null padding (`b'\\x00'`) at the beginning or end of the stream.

By eliminating extraneous padding, this enhancement ensures that buffer size calculations are accurate and that consumers of the audio data work with a clean, byte-exact representation. This reduces inconsistencies during testing and improves interoperability with systems that rely on precise buffer contents.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nCurrently, audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio_with_size()` may contain unintended null padding at the beginning or end of the stream. This can lead to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, or unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders or file writers expecting tightly packed data.\n\n**Solution**\nThe implementation trims leading and trailing `b'\\x00'` bytes from the raw audio buffer after resolution and before computing its size. This ensures that only meaningful audio data is returned, leading to more deterministic behavior and preventing false negatives in tests that compare buffer contents directly.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n\n**Problem**: Audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio()` may contain unintended null padding (`b'\\x00'`) at the beginning or end of the stream. This leads to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, and unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders or file writers expecting tightly packed data.\n\n**Goal**: Add trimming functionality to remove leading and trailing null bytes from resolved audio buffers to ensure accurate size validation and cleaner downstream processing.\n\n**Requirements**: \n- Add a `trim` boolean parameter to the `resolve_audio()` method\n- When `trim=True`, strip leading and trailing `b'\\x00'` bytes from the audio buffer\n- Maintain backward compatibility (default `trim=False`)\n- Work with BytesIO objects returned by `resolve_binary()`\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n\n**Current Architecture**:\n- File: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- Class: `AudioBlock` (lines 130-186)\n- Method: `resolve_audio()` (lines 173-186)\n- Current method simply returns result from `resolve_binary()` utility function\n\n**Critical Implementation Notes**:\n1. `resolve_binary()` returns a `BytesIO` object, not raw bytes\n2. Must call `.getvalue()` to extract bytes, apply `.strip(b'\\x00')`, then wrap in new `BytesIO`\n3. The `trim` parameter comes BEFORE the `on_resolve` parameter (coordinated with Agent 1)\n4. Trimming logic executes BEFORE callback invocation (Agent 1's feature)\n5.

Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enhancement supports UI progress indicators, logging, and custom metric collection.\n\n**Description**\nThis feature allows developers to pass a progress hook via the `on_resolve` parameter when calling `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()`.

existing parameter documentation\n- Use 12-space indentation for parameter descriptions (matching existing style)\n- Keep descriptions concise and clear\n\n### Step 4: Replace single-line return with multi-line implementation\n\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n**Location**: Lines 181-186 (current implementation)\n\n**Action**: Replace\n\n**Before Code**:\n```python\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n```\n\n**After Code**:\n```python\n        buffer = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n        \n        if trim:\n            raw_data = buffer.getvalue()\n            trimmed_data = raw_data.strip(b'\\x00')\n            buffer = BytesIO(trimmed_data)\n        \n        if on_resolve:\n            on_resolve(len(buffer.getvalue()))\n        \n        return buffer\n```\n\n**Critical Details**:\n- Store the result from `resolve_binary()` in a `buffer` variable instead of returning directly\n- Add blank line after the `resolve_binary()` call for readability\n- The `trim` logic block comes first (Agent 2's feature), followed by the `on_resolve` callback (my feature)\n- The callback receives `len(buffer.getvalue())` to get the byte count of the BytesIO buffer\n- Both conditional blocks (`if trim:` and `if on_resolve:`) use proper 8-space indentation\n- The callback is only invoked if `on_resolve` is not None\n- Final `return buffer` statement at the end\n- Maintain consistent 8-space indentation for all code within the method body\n\n### Step 5: Verification checklist\n\n**File**: N/A (verification step)\n\n**Action**: Verify\n\n**Critical Details**:\nAfter implementing all changes, verify:\n1. \u2713 `Callable` is imported from typing module\n2. \u2713 Method signature includes all three parameters: `as_base64`, `trim`, `on_resolve`\n3. \u2713 All parameters have appropriate default values\n4. \u2713 Docstring documents all three parameters\n5. \u2713 Implementation stores buffer instead of immediate return\n6. \u2713 Trim logic executes before callback (correct order)\n7. \u2713 Callback receives byte count via `len(buffer.getvalue())`\n8. \u2713 Callback invocation is conditional on `on_resolve` not being None\n9. \u2713 Method returns the buffer at the end\n10. \u2713 All indentation is consistent (4 spaces for class level, 8 spaces for method body)\n\n## COORDINATION SUMMARY\n\n**File Ownership**: \n- Shared file: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- Both Agent 1 (me) and Agent 2 modify the same method\n\n**Division of Changes**:\n- Import addition: Both agents add `Callable` to typing imports (identical change)\n- Method signature: Both agents add their respective parameters (`on_resolve` for me, `trim` for Agent 2)\n- Docstring: Both agents document their parameters\n- Implementation: Agent 2's trim logic executes first, then my callback logic\n\n**Final State Agreement**:\nBoth agents target the exact same final state for the `resolve_audio()` method, ensuring merge compatibility. The features are independent but coordinated:\n- Agent 2's feature: Trim null bytes from audio buffer\n- My feature: Invoke callback with final byte count\n\nThis coordination ensures no merge conflicts while maintaining independent feature implementations.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2025-11-28T01:54:13.294010", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:53399": 53399, "http://localhost:56108": 56108}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-11-28", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-11-28T01:54:26.998689", "source": "agent", "message": "I am interacting with the MCP server with name:\n```\nopenhands_comm_send\n```\nand arguments:\n```\n{'content': \"Hello!
