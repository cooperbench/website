Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enhancement supports UI progress indicators, logging, and custom metric collection.\n\n**Description**\nThis feature allows developers to pass a progress hook via the `on_resolve` parameter when calling `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()`. The callback receives the byte count of the resolved audio buffer, providing visibility into data size at runtime. This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nConsumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.\n\n**Solution**\nAn optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\n**Problem:** Consumers of audio blocks need visibility into the byte size of resolved audio buffers for UI progress indicators, logging, and metric collection, but currently have no way to extract this information without duplicating resolution logic.\n\n**Goal:** Add an optional `on_resolve` callback parameter to the `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()` method that receives the final byte count of the resolved audio buffer.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Add optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None] | None = None` parameter to `resolve_audio()` method\n- Invoke callback with byte size after resolution if provided\n- Maintain backward compatibility (callback is optional)\n- Import `Callable` type from typing module\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Modify `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()` in `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- The method calls `resolve_binary()` which returns a `BytesIO` object\n- We need to get the buffer size using `buffer.getbuffer().nbytes` and invoke the callback\n- Return the BytesIO object as before\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n- `resolve_binary()` returns `BytesIO` object (confirmed in llama_index/core/utils.py lines 624-670)\n- BytesIO has a `getbuffer()` method that returns a memoryview with `.nbytes` attribute\n- The callback is optional and should only be invoked if provided\n- This feature is completely backward compatible\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- **Agent 2** is adding new `resolve_*_with_size()` methods AFTER existing resolve methods\n- **I own:** Lines 9-19 (imports) and lines 173-186 (resolve_audio method)\n- **Agent 2 owns:** New methods added after lines 126, 186, and 223\n- **No conflicts:** I modify existing lines, Agent 2 adds new lines after my changes\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add Callable import to typing imports\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location:** Line 9-19 (typing imports section)\n**Action:** Modify\n**Before Code:**\n```python\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\n```\n**After Code:**\n```python\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Callable,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\n```\n**Critical Details:** \n- Add `Callable,` after `AsyncGenerator,` on line 13 (alphabetically sorted)\n- Maintain 4-space indentation\n- Keep the comma after `Callable`\n\n### Step 2: Modify resolve_audio() method signature and implementation\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location:** Lines 173-186 (entire resolve_audio method)\n**Action:** Replace\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can

resolve_audio(\n        self, as_base64: bool = False, on_resolve: Callable[[int], None] | None = None\n    ) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n            on_resolve (Callable[[int], None] | None): optional callback invoked with the byte size of the resolved audio buffer\n\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n        if on_resolve is not None:\n            on_resolve(buffer.getbuffer().nbytes)\n        return buffer\n```\n**Critical Details:**\n- Method signature spans 2 lines now (line 173-174) due to new parameter\n- Add `on_resolve` parameter with type hint `Callable[[int], None] | None = None`\n- Update docstring to document the new parameter (line 179)\n- Store result of `resolve_binary()` in `buffer` variable (line 181)\n- Add conditional check: `if on_resolve is not None:` before invoking callback (line 187)\n- Invoke callback with `buffer.getbuffer().nbytes` to get byte count (line 188)\n- Return `buffer` at the end (line 189)\n- Maintain 4-space indentation for method body, 8-space for nested code\n- The method ends at line 189 (Agent 2 will add their new method starting at line 190)\n\n### Step 3: Verify no other changes needed\n**File:** None\n**Action:** Verification\n**Critical Details:**\n- No changes to `resolve_image()` or `resolve_document()` methods\n- No changes to AudioBlock class initialization or other methods\n- No changes to imports beyond adding `Callable`\n- Feature is complete with just these two modifications\n- Backward compatible: existing code without `on_resolve` parameter continues to work\n\n## TESTING CONSIDERATIONS\n- Test with callback provided: verify it receives correct byte count\n- Test without callback (None): verify backward compatibility\n- Test with base64 encoding enabled: verify callback receives correct size\n- Test with different audio sources (raw_bytes, path, url)\n\n## FINAL VERIFICATION\nAfter implementation:\n- Lines 1-172: Unchanged (except line 13 has added Callable import)\n- Lines 173-189: Modified resolve_audio() method with callback support\n- Lines 190+: Unchanged (Agent 2 will add their methods here)\n- Total changes: 1 import addition, 1 method modification (14 lines \u2192 17 lines)\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Modify `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()` in `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- The method calls `resolve_binary()` which returns a `BytesIO` object\n- We need to get the buffer size using `buffer.getbuffer().nbytes` and invoke the callback\n- Return the BytesIO object as before\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n- `resolve_binary()` returns `BytesIO` object (confirmed in llama_index/core/utils.py lines 624-670)\n- BytesIO has a `getbuffer()` method that returns a memoryview with `.nbytes` attribute\n- The callback is optional and should only be invoked if provided\n- This feature is completely backward compatible\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- **Agent 2** is adding new `resolve_*_with_size()` methods AFTER existing resolve methods\n- **I own:** Lines 9-19 (imports) and lines 173-186 (resolve_audio method)\n- **Agent 2 owns:** New methods added after lines 126, 186, and 223\n- **No conflicts:** I modify existing lines, Agent 2 adds new lines after my changes\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add Callable import to typing imports\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location:** Line 9-19 (typing imports section)\n**Action:** Modify\n**Before Code:**\n```python\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\n```\n**After Code:**\n```python\nfrom typing import (\n    Annotated,\n    Any,\n    AsyncGenerator,\n    Callable,\n    Generator,\n    List,\n    Literal,\n    Optional,\n    Union,\n    cast,\n)\n```\n**Critical Details:** \n- Add `Callable,` after `AsyncGenerator,` on line 13 (alphabetically sorted)\n- Maintain 4-space indentation\n- Keep the comma after `Callable`\n\n### Step 2: Modify resolve_audio() method signature and implementation\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location:** Lines 173-186 (entire resolve_audio method)\n**Action:** Replace\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n```\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_audio(\n        self, as_base64: bool = False, on_resolve: Callable[[int], None] | None = None\n    ) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n            on_resolve (Callable[[int], None] | None): optional callback invoked with the byte size of the resolved audio buffer\n\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n        if on_resolve is not None:\n            on_resolve(buffer.getbuffer().nbytes)\n        return buffer\n```\n**Critical Details:**\n- Method signature spans 2 lines now (line 173-174) due to new parameter\n- Add `on_resolve` parameter with type hint `Callable[[int], None] | None = None`\n- Update docstring to document the new parameter (line 179)\n- Store result of `resolve_binary()` in `buffer` variable (line 181)\n- Add conditional check: `if on_resolve is not None:` before invoking callback (line 187)\n- Invoke callback with `buffer.getbuffer().nbytes` to get byte count (line 188)\n- Return `buffer` at the end (line 189)\n- Maintain 4-space indentation for method body, 8-space for nested code\n- The method ends at line 189 (Agent 2 will add their new method starting at line 190)\n\n### Step 3: Verify no other changes needed\n**File:** None\n**Action:** Verification\n**Critical Details:**\n- No changes to `resolve_image()` or `resolve_document()` methods\n- No changes to AudioBlock class initialization or other methods\n- No changes to imports beyond adding `Callable`\n- Feature is complete with just these two modifications\n- Backward compatible: existing code without `on_resolve` parameter continues to work\n\n## TESTING CONSIDERATIONS\n- Test with callback provided: verify it receives correct byte count\n- Test without callback (None): verify backward compatibility\n- Test with base64 encoding enabled: verify callback receives correct size\n- Test with different audio sources (raw_bytes, path, url)\n\n## FINAL VERIFICATION\nAfter implementation:\n- Lines 1-172: Unchanged (except line 13 has added Callable import)\n- Lines 173-189: Modified resolve_audio() method with callback support\n- Lines 190+: Unchanged (Agent 2 will add their methods here)\n- Total changes: 1 import addition, 1 method modification (14 lines \u2192 17 lines)\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The bash command to execute.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Currently, this requires manually seeking the buffer to find its size, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n\n**Goal:** Implement new method variants `resolve_image_with_size()`, `resolve_audio_with_size()`, and `resolve_document_with_size()` that return a tuple `(BytesIO, int)` containing both the resolved buffer and its byte size in a single call.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Add three new methods, one in each block class (ImageBlock, AudioBlock, DocumentBlock)\n- Methods return `tuple[BytesIO, int]` where the int is the byte count\n- Original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged for backward compatibility\n- Use existing `resolve_binary()` function for resolution logic\n- Calculate size by seeking to end of buffer and returning position\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- File: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- Three classes to modify: ImageBlock, AudioBlock, DocumentBlock\n- Each class gets one new method added after its existing resolve method\n- Methods will call the existing resolve method, then calculate size\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n- Agent 1 is modifying lines 173-186 (resolve_audio method) and adding Callable to imports\n- I am adding NEW methods only, no modifications to existing methods\n- No new imports needed (BytesIO and int are already available)\n- After calling resolve to get BytesIO, seek to end to get size, then seek back to 0\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**File Ownership for llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py:**\n- **Agent 1 owns:**\n  - Lines 9-19: Adding `Callable` to imports\n  - Lines 173-186: Modifying `resolve_audio()` method signature and body\n- **I own (Agent 2):**\n  - After line 126: Add `resolve_image_with_size()` in ImageBlock\n  - After line 186: Add `resolve_audio_with_size()` in AudioBlock\n  - After line 223: Add `resolve_document_with_size()` in DocumentBlock\n\n**No Conflicts:** Agent 1 modifies existing lines, I insert new methods after.

Currently, this requires manually seeking the buffer to find its size, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n\n**Goal:** Implement new method variants `resolve_image_with_size()`, `resolve_audio_with_size()`, and `resolve_document_with_size()` that return a tuple `(BytesIO, int)` containing both the resolved buffer and its byte size in a single call.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Add three new methods, one in each block class (ImageBlock, AudioBlock, DocumentBlock)\n- Methods return `tuple[BytesIO, int]` where the int is the byte count\n- Original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged for backward compatibility\n- Use existing `resolve_binary()` function for resolution logic\n- Calculate size by seeking to end of buffer and returning position\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- File: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- Three classes to modify: ImageBlock, AudioBlock, DocumentBlock\n- Each class gets one new method added after its existing resolve method\n- Methods will call the existing resolve method, then calculate size\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n- Agent 1 is modifying lines 173-186 (resolve_audio method) and adding Callable to imports\n- I am adding NEW methods only, no modifications to existing methods\n- No new imports needed (BytesIO and int are already available)\n- After calling resolve to get BytesIO, seek to end to get size, then seek back to 0\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**File Ownership for llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py:**\n- **Agent 1 owns:**\n  - Lines 9-19: Adding `Callable` to imports\n  - Lines 173-186: Modifying `resolve_audio()` method signature and body\n- **I own (Agent 2):**\n  - After line 126: Add `resolve_image_with_size()` in ImageBlock\n  - After line 186: Add `resolve_audio_with_size()` in AudioBlock\n  - After line 223: Add `resolve_document_with_size()` in DocumentBlock\n\n**No Conflicts:** Agent 1 modifies existing lines, I insert new methods after. Line ranges are non-overlapping.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add resolve_image_with_size() method to ImageBlock class\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`  \n**Location:** After line 126 (immediately after the resolve_image method in ImageBlock class)  \n**Action:** Add  \n**Before Code:** \n```python\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.image,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.image,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n\n    def resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple[BytesIO, int]: A tuple containing the resolved image buffer and its size in bytes\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = self.resolve_image(as_base64=as_base64)\n        buffer.seek(0, 2)  #
