Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Additionally, a new `filters` configuration parameter has been introduced, enabling predicate pushdown when reading Parquet files. This feature allows users to filter data on the fly, reducing the amount of data read into memory and improving query efficiency.\n\nFor example, you can filter a dataset by specific column values as shown below:\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nfilters = [('problem_source', '==', 'math')]\nds = load_dataset(\"nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2\", streaming=True, filters=filters)\nfirst_example = next(iter(ds[\"train\"]))\nprint(first_example[\"problem_source\"])\n# 'math'\n```\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nStreaming data from Parquet files can be slow, especially for large datasets. Additionally, applying filters while loading data was not natively supported, which resulted in unnecessary data being loaded into memory.\n\n**Solution**:\n* Implement faster Parquet streaming using a buffered stream to enhance data reading performance.\n* Introduce the `filters` configuration parameter to support predicate pushdown, which applies filters directly during data reading, reducing memory usage and speeding up data loading.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\n**Problem:** Streaming data from Parquet files can be slow, especially for large datasets. Additionally, applying filters while loading data was not natively supported, which resulted in unnecessary data being loaded into memory.\n\n**Goal:** Implement faster Parquet streaming using a buffered stream to enhance data reading performance and introduce a `filters` configuration parameter to support predicate pushdown, which applies filters directly during data reading.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add `import io` for buffered stream support\n2. Add `filters` parameter to `ParquetConfig` class to accept filter expressions\n3. Modify file reading to use `io.BufferedReader` for performance improvement\n4. Pass filters to PyArrow's `iter_batches()` method for predicate pushdown\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nfilters = [('problem_source', '==', 'math')]\nds = load_dataset(\"nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2\", streaming=True, filters=filters)\nfirst_example = next(iter(ds[\"train\"]))\nprint(first_example[\"problem_source\"])\n# 'math'\n```\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n**Architecture:**\n- Modify `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py` only\n- The `filters` parameter follows PyArrow's filter syntax (list of tuples)\n- BufferedReader wraps the file handle to improve I/O performance\n- PyArrow's `iter_batches()` natively supports filters for predicate pushdown\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n1. PyArrow ParquetFile already supports filters in `iter_batches()` - we just need to pass them through\n2. BufferedReader improves streaming performance by approximately 2x on some machines\n3. Filters use PyArrow's native predicate pushdown, reducing memory usage and improving query efficiency\n4. The other agent is adding `sort_by` parameter at line 22 and sorting logic at lines 90-91 - no conflicts\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**Shared File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n**My Ownership (Filters + Buffered Streaming):**\n- Line 1: Add `import io`\n- Line 21: Add `filters: Optional[List] = None` parameter to ParquetConfig\n- Line 82: Modify to use `io.BufferedReader(f)` for buffered streaming\n- Line 87: Add `filters=self.config.filters` parameter to iter_batches call\n\n**Other Agent's Ownership (Sorting Feature):**\n- Line 22: Adds `sort_by: Optional[str] = None` parameter to ParquetConfig (right after my filters line)\n- Lines 90-91: Adds sorting logic after pa_table creation (after my changes)\n\n**No Conflicts:** All changes are at distinct line numbers with clear separation of concerns.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add io import for BufferedReader support\n**File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n**Location:** Line 1 (top of file, in imports section)\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\nimport itertools\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\nimport io\nimport itertools\n```\n\n**Critical Details:** \n- Add `import io` as the very first line of the file\n- This is needed for `io.BufferedReader` used in Step 3\n- Keep all other imports exactly as they are (itertools, dataclasses, typing, pyarrow, datasets remain unchanged)\n\n### Step 2: Add filters parameter to ParquetConfig class\n**File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n**Location:** Line 21 (after line 20 `columns: Optional[List[str]] = None`, before line 21 `features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None`)\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    filters: Optional[List] = None\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add `filters: Optional[List] = None` as a new line between `columns` and `features`\n- Maintain exact same indentation (4 spaces) as other parameters\n- The type is `Optional[List]` to accept PyArrow filter expressions like `[('column', '==', 'value')]`\n- The other agent will add their `sort_by` parameter after this line\n- This is inside the `ParquetConfig` dataclass (lines 15-24)\n\n### Step 3: Modify file reading to use BufferedReader for performance\n**File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n**Location:** Line 82 (inside _generate_tables method)\n**Action:** Modify\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n            with open(file, \"rb\") as f:\n                parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile(f)\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n            with open(file, \"rb\") as f:\n                parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile(io.BufferedReader(f))\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Only modify line 82, where `pq.ParquetFile(f)` is called\n- Wrap the file handle `f` with `io.BufferedReader(f)`\n- Keep the `with open(file, \"rb\") as f:` statement on line 81 unchanged\n- Maintain exact same indentation (16 spaces for line 82)\n- This change improves streaming performance by approximately 2x\n- The `with` block structure and all subsequent code remain unchanged\n\n### Step 4: Add filters parameter to iter_batches call for predicate pushdown\n**File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n**Location:** Line 87 (inside _generate_tables method, in the for loop)\n**Action:** Modify\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n                        for batch_idx, record_batch in enumerate(\n                            parquet_file.iter_batches(batch_size=batch_size, columns=self.config.columns)\n                        ):\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n                        for batch_idx, record_batch in enumerate(\n                            parquet_file.iter_batches(batch_size=batch_size, columns=self.config.columns, filters=self.config.filters)\n                        ):\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Only modify line 87, adding `, filters=self.config.filters` at the end of the iter_batches call\n- Keep the line continuation and closing parenthesis on line 88 exactly as is\n- Maintain exact same indentation (28 spaces for the iter_batches call)\n- PyArrow's `iter_batches()` natively supports filters for predicate pushdown\n- If `self.config.filters` is None, PyArrow will ignore it (no filtering applied)\n- The other agent's sorting logic will be added after line 89 (pa_table creation) - no conflict here\n\n## VALIDATION\nAfter implementation, the feature can be tested with:\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# Test with filters\nfilters = [('problem_source', '==', 'math')]\nds = load_dataset(\"nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2\", streaming=True, filters=filters)\nfirst_example = next(iter(ds[\"train\"]))\nassert first_example[\"problem_source\"] == 'math'\n\n# Test without filters (backwards compatibility)\nds = load_dataset(\"nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2\", streaming=True)\nfirst_example = next(iter(ds[\"train\"]))\n# Should work as before\n```\n\n## FINAL NOTES\n- All changes are minimal and focused on the specific feature requirements\n- BufferedReader improves I/O performance without changing functionality\n- Filters parameter enables predicate pushdown via PyArrow's native support\n- No conflicts with other agent's sorting feature (different line numbers)\n- Backwards compatible: filters=None (default) means no filtering applied\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5.

Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Users can now provide a `sort_by` parameter in the `ParquetConfig` class, enabling the sorting of data as it streams. This is particularly useful in cases where ordered data is required before further processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nStreaming data in its original order can be inefficient or impractical when ordered data is required for subsequent operations.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution adds a `sort_by` parameter to the `ParquetConfig` class, which allows users to specify a column for sorting while streaming parquet data. This improves the usability of the dataset in scenarios where data order is crucial.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Support for Sorting During Streaming\n\n## CONTEXT\n\n**Problem:** Streaming data in its original order can be inefficient or impractical when ordered data is required for subsequent operations.\n\n**Goal:** Add ability to specify a column for sorting during streaming of parquet data by introducing a `sort_by` parameter to the `ParquetConfig` class.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Add `sort_by` parameter to `ParquetConfig` class\n- Apply sorting to streamed data before yielding\n- Maintain compatibility with existing functionality\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Modify `ParquetConfig` dataclass to include optional `sort_by` parameter\n- Modify `_generate_tables` method to apply sorting after table creation but before yielding\n- Use PyArrow's native `sort_by()` method for efficient sorting\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n- PyArrow is already imported, no additional imports needed\n- Sorting happens after table is created from batches but before yield\n- Sorting is optional and only applied when `sort_by` is not None\n- Must maintain same indentation (12 spaces) within the `_generate_tables` method\n\n## COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENT\n\n**Other Agent's Feature:** Faster Parquet Streaming + Filters with Predicate Pushdown\n\n**Shared File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n**Other Agent Handles:**\n- Line 1: Adding `import io`\n- Line 21: Adding `filters: Optional[List] = None` to ParquetConfig\n- Line 82: Modifying to `parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile(io.BufferedReader(f))`\n- Line 87: Adding `filters=self.config.filters` parameter to iter_batches\n\n**I Handle:**\n- Line 22: Adding `sort_by: Optional[str] = None` (after other agent's filters line)\n- Lines 90-91: Adding sorting logic\n\n**No Conflicts:** Changes are at distinct lines with clear separation.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add sort_by parameter to ParquetConfig class\n\n**File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n**Location:** Line 22 (new line after line 21 where other agent adds filters parameter)\n\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass ParquetConfig(datasets.BuilderConfig):\n    \"\"\"BuilderConfig for Parquet.\"\"\"\n\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    filters: Optional[List] = None  # Added by other agent at line 21\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass ParquetConfig(datasets.BuilderConfig):\n    \"\"\"BuilderConfig for Parquet.\"\"\"\n\n    batch_size: Optional[int] = None\n    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None\n    filters: Optional[List] = None  # Added by other agent at line 21\n    sort_by: Optional[str] = None\n    features: Optional[datasets.Features] = None\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add exactly at line 22, immediately after the `filters` parameter added by other agent\n- Maintain exact same indentation as other parameters (4 spaces)\n- Use `Optional[str]` type hint with default value `None`\n- Keep `features` parameter as the last parameter in the class\n\n### Step 2: Add sorting logic in _generate_tables method\n\n**File:** `src/datasets/packaged_modules/parquet/parquet.py`\n\n**Location:** Lines 90-91 (new lines inserted after line 89 where pa_table is created)\n\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n                        for batch_idx, record_batch in enumerate(\n                            parquet_file.iter_batches(batch_size=batch_size, columns=self.config.columns, filters=self.config.filters)\n                        ):\n                            pa_table = pa.Table.from_batches([record_batch])\n                            #

The sorting is applied after filtering, which is the correct order of operations.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

The final merged version will have both features working together - filtering with predicate pushdown and sorting during streaming.\n\nImplementation complete! \ud83c\udf89"}}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 71, "timestamp": "2025-11-04T17:36:26.111871", "source": "agent", "message": "Managing 3 task items.", "action": "task_tracking", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "task_tracker", "tool_call_id": "tooluse_RkeqKibLRFuyVnVQ1staOw", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-c00fa69e-060a-41bc-bc78-75a96c68b3aa", "created": 1762277786, "model": "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "Please continue.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"task_list\": [{\"id\": \"1\", \"notes\": \"Add 'sort_by: Optional[str] = None' parameter to ParquetConfig class between columns and features parameters\", \"title\": \"Add sort_by parameter to ParquetConfig class\", \"status\": \"done\"}, {\"id\": \"2\", \"notes\": \"Add conditional sorting logic after pa_table creation (lines 90-91) to sort by specified column if sort_by is not None\", \"title\": \"Add sorting logic in _generate_tables method\", \"status\": \"done\"}, {\"id\": \"3\", \"notes\": \"Ensure changes are compatible with agent_1's changes and send final status update\", \"title\": \"Verify implementation and coordinate with agent_1\", \"status\": \"done\"}], \"command\": \"plan\"}", "name": "task_tracker"}, "id": "tooluse_RkeqKibLRFuyVnVQ1staOw", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 23420, "total_tokens": 23664, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 1.101294, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 340233, "completion_tokens": 5373, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 200000, "per_turn_token": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "plan", "task_list": [{"id": "1", "notes": "Add 'sort_by: Optional[str] = None' parameter to ParquetConfig class between columns and features parameters", "title": "Add sort_by parameter to ParquetConfig class", "status": "done"}, {"id": "2", "notes": "Add conditional sorting logic after pa_table creation (lines 90-91) to sort by specified column if sort_by is not None", "title": "Add sorting logic in _generate_tables method", "status": "done"}, {"id": "3", "notes": "Ensure changes are compatible with agent_1's changes and send final status update", "title": "Verify implementation and coordinate with agent_1", "status": "done"}], "thought": "Please continue."}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 72, "timestamp": "2025-11-04T17:36:26.116585", "source": "agent", "message": "Task list has been updated with 3 items.
