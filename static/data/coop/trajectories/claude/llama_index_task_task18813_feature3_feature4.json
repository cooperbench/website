Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This ensures that only meaningful audio data is returned, leading to more deterministic behavior and preventing false negatives in tests that compare buffer contents directly.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\n**Problem:** Audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio()` may contain unintended null padding (`b'\\x00'`) at the beginning or end of the stream, leading to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, and unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders.\n\n**Goal:** Add a `trim` parameter to the `resolve_audio()` method to enable trimming of leading and trailing null bytes from audio buffers.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add a `trim` boolean parameter to `resolve_audio()` method with default value `False` (backward compatible)\n2. When `trim=True`, strip leading and trailing `b'\\x00'` bytes from the resolved audio buffer\n3. Return a BytesIO object containing the trimmed audio data\n4. Maintain existing functionality when `trim=False`\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- The `resolve_audio()` method in the `AudioBlock` class currently calls `resolve_binary()` which returns a `BytesIO` object\n- The trimming logic must be applied AFTER `resolve_binary()` returns the buffer but BEFORE returning to the caller\n- The implementation reads the buffer content, strips null bytes from both ends, and wraps the result in a new BytesIO object\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n- The other agent is adding `resolve_audio_with_size()` method after line 186 that will call this modified `resolve_audio()` method and pass through the `trim` parameter\n- Must maintain backward compatibility by defaulting `trim=False`\n- BytesIO objects need to be read with `.getvalue()` to get the bytes content\n- Python's `bytes.strip(b'\\x00')` removes all leading and trailing null bytes efficiently\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**File Ownership:**\n- **I own:** Modifications to existing `resolve_audio()` method (lines 173-186) in `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- **Other agent owns:** Three new `*_with_size()` methods to be added after lines 126, 186, and 223 in the same file\n\n**Integration:**\n- Other agent's `resolve_audio_with_size(as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = False)` method will call my modified `self.resolve_audio(as_base64=as_base64, trim=trim)` to leverage the trimming feature\n- No merge conflicts expected as I'm modifying existing method lines (173-186) and other agent is adding new methods after line 186\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify the resolve_audio() method signature\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location:** Line 173\n**Action:** Replace\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add `trim: bool = False` parameter after `as_base64` parameter\n- Default to `False` for backward compatibility\n- Keep exact same indentation (4 spaces)\n- Keep the return type annotation `-> BytesIO`\n\n### Step 2: Update the docstring\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location:** Lines 174-179\n**Action:** Replace\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n            trim (bool): whether to trim leading and trailing null bytes from the audio buffer\n\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add the `trim` parameter documentation after the `as_base64` documentation\n- Keep exact same indentation (8 spaces for the Args section)\n- Maintain the blank line before the closing triple quotes\n\n### Step 3: Implement the trimming logic\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location:** Lines 181-186\n**Action:** Replace\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n        buffer = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n        \n        if trim:\n            # Read the buffer content, trim null bytes, and create a new BytesIO\n            audio_bytes = buffer.getvalue()\n            trimmed_bytes = audio_bytes.strip(b'\\x00')\n            return BytesIO(trimmed_bytes)\n        \n        return buffer\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Store the result of `resolve_binary()` in a variable named `buffer` instead of returning immediately\n- Add a blank line after the `resolve_binary()` call for readability\n- Use `if trim:` to conditionally apply trimming logic\n- Use `buffer.getvalue()` to extract bytes from the BytesIO object\n- Use `audio_bytes.strip(b'\\x00')` to remove all leading and trailing null bytes\n- Wrap the trimmed bytes in a new `BytesIO` object before returning\n- If `trim=False`, return the original buffer unchanged\n- Maintain proper indentation (8 spaces for method body, 12 spaces for if block)\n- Ensure there's no extra blank line before the DocumentBlock class that starts at line 188\n\n## VALIDATION\nAfter implementation:\n1. The `resolve_audio()` method signature should include both `as_base64` and `trim` parameters\n2. When called with `trim=False` (default), behavior should be identical to before\n3. When called with `trim=True`, the returned BytesIO should contain audio data with no leading or trailing null bytes\n4. The other agent's `resolve_audio_with_size()` method should be able to call this method and pass through the `trim` parameter\n5. Line 187 should be the blank line before the DocumentBlock class, allowing the other agent to add their method after line 186\n\n## IMPORTS REQUIRED\nNo new imports required - all necessary imports already exist:\n- `BytesIO` from `io` module (already imported at top of file)\n- `resolve_binary` from `llama_index.core.utils` (already imported at top of file)\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world!

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Currently, this requires manually seeking the buffer, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n\n**Goal:** Implement new method variants `resolve_image_with_size()`, `resolve_audio_with_size()`, and `resolve_document_with_size()` that return a tuple `(BytesIO, int)` containing both the resolved buffer and its byte size.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add three new methods to their respective classes in `types.py`\n2. Each method returns a tuple of (BytesIO buffer, int size)\n3. Maintain backward compatibility - original methods remain unchanged\n4. Integrate with Agent 1's trim feature for `resolve_audio_with_size()`\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- File: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- Three classes to modify: ImageBlock, AudioBlock, DocumentBlock\n- Each new method will call the existing `resolve_*()` method, then calculate size\n- Size calculation: seek to end, get position, seek back to start\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n1. Agent 1 is modifying `resolve_audio()` at lines 173-186 to add `trim: bool = False` parameter\n2. My `resolve_audio_with_size()` must accept and pass through the `trim` parameter\n3. All methods calculate size using: `buffer.seek(0, 2)` to get end position, then `buffer.seek(0)` to reset\n4. Tuple return type is `tuple[BytesIO, int]` for Python 3.9+ compatibility\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**Agent 1 owns:**\n- Modifications to existing `resolve_audio()` method (lines 173-186)\n- Adding `trim: bool = False` parameter and trimming logic\n\n**I own:**\n- All three new `_with_size()` method additions\n- No line conflicts since I'm adding after Agent 1's modifications\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add resolve_image_with_size() method to ImageBlock class\n\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n**Location:** After line 126 (after the `resolve_image()` method ends)\n\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_image(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.image,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_image(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.image,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n\n    def resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple[BytesIO, int]: A tuple containing the resolved image buffer and its size in bytes\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = self.resolve_image(as_base64=as_base64)\n        buffer.seek(0, 2)  #

All three methods return `tuple[BytesIO, int]`\n5. All three methods properly reset buffer position to start before returning\n6. `resolve_audio_with_size()` correctly passes through the `trim` parameter to Agent 1's modified `resolve_audio()` method\n\n**Testing considerations:**\n- Each method should be callable independently\n- Size should match actual buffer content length\n- Buffer position should be at start (0) when returned\n- `resolve_audio_with_size(trim=True)` should work with Agent 1's trimming feature\n\n**No imports needed** - All required types and functions already imported at top of file.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Currently, this requires manually seeking the buffer, which is repetitive and error-prone.\n\n**Goal:** Implement new method variants `resolve_image_with_size()`, `resolve_audio_with_size()`, and `resolve_document_with_size()` that return a tuple `(BytesIO, int)` containing both the resolved buffer and its byte size.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add three new methods to their respective classes in `types.py`\n2. Each method returns a tuple of (BytesIO buffer, int size)\n3. Maintain backward compatibility - original methods remain unchanged\n4. Integrate with Agent 1's trim feature for `resolve_audio_with_size()`\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- File: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- Three classes to modify: ImageBlock, AudioBlock, DocumentBlock\n- Each new method will call the existing `resolve_*()` method, then calculate size\n- Size calculation: seek to end, get position, seek back to start\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n1. Agent 1 is modifying `resolve_audio()` at lines 173-186 to add `trim: bool = False` parameter\n2. My `resolve_audio_with_size()` must accept and pass through the `trim` parameter\n3. All methods calculate size using: `buffer.seek(0, 2)` to get end position, then `buffer.seek(0)` to reset\n4. Tuple return type is `tuple[BytesIO, int]` for Python 3.9+ compatibility\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**Agent 1 owns:**\n- Modifications to existing `resolve_audio()` method (lines 173-186)\n- Adding `trim: bool = False` parameter and trimming logic\n\n**I own:**\n- All three new `_with_size()` method additions\n- No line conflicts since I'm adding after Agent 1's modifications\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add resolve_image_with_size() method to ImageBlock class\n\n**File:** `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n**Location:** After line 126 (after the `resolve_image()` method ends)\n\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_image(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.image,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    def resolve_image(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.image,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n\n    def resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an image and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple[BytesIO, int]: A tuple containing the resolved image buffer and its size in bytes\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = self.resolve_image(as_base64=as_base64)\n        buffer.seek(0, 2)  #

The method will be able to call `self.resolve_audio(as_base64=as_base64, trim=trim)` and pass through the trim parameter as planned.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification!"}}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 17, "timestamp": "2025-11-05T03:26:03.577757", "source": "agent", "message": "Running Python code interactively: \n# Test the implementation\nfrom io import BytesIO\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, '/workspace/llama-index-core')\n\nfrom llama_index.core.base.llms.types import AudioBlock\n\n# Test 1: Create an audio block with null bytes padding\naudio_data_with_padding = b'\\x00\\x00\\x00test audio data\\x00\\x00\\x00'\naudio_block = AudioBlock(audio=audio_data_with_padding)\n\n# Test without trimming (default behavior)\nresult_no_trim = audio_block.resolve_audio(trim=False)\nprint(f\"Without trim: {result_no_trim.getvalue()} [YOYOYO]\")\nprint(f\"Length without trim: {len(result_no_trim.getvalue())} [YOYOYO]\")\n\n# Test with trimming\nresult_with_trim = audio_block.resolve_audio(trim=True)\nprint(f\"With trim: {result_with_trim.getvalue()} [YOYOYO]\")\nprint(f\"Length with trim: {len(result_with_trim.getvalue())} [YOYOYO]\")\n\n# Verify the trimming worked correctly\nassert result_with_trim.getvalue() == b'test audio data', \"Trimming should remove null bytes\"\nassert result_no_trim.getvalue() == audio_data_with_padding, \"Without trim should preserve original data\"\n\nprint(\"\\nAll tests passed!

According to the plan, I need to:\\n1. Add resolve_image_with_size() after line 126\\n2. Add resolve_audio_with_size() after line 186 (after the other agent's modifications)\\n3. Add resolve_document_with_size() after line 223\\n\\nLooking at the current file, I can see that:\\n- resolve_audio() is currently at lines 173-186 and does NOT have the trim parameter yet\\n- This means the other agent hasn't made their changes yet\\n\\nI should wait or check if there's a way to coordinate. However, since I can't send messages directly, let me proceed with my implementation. I'll implement my methods in a way that will work with the other agent's changes. The key is that my resolve_audio_with_size() method will need to accept the trim parameter and pass it through to resolve_audio().\\n\\nLet me start implementing the three methods as planned.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "tooluse_ihiEZHPDRr-lD8Twvtw7_w", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 399, "prompt_tokens": 17956, "total_tokens": 18355, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 17, "timestamp": "2025-11-05T03:30:05.287682", "source": "agent", "message": "Clearing the task list.", "action": "task_tracking", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "task_tracker", "tool_call_id": "tooluse_WXo4u78rQXWcFf_QIXOLLw", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-d489dc71-feda-4148-83cb-831e2bec3939", "created": 1762313405, "model": "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "Let me create a task tracker to organize my work:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\"}", "name": "task_tracker"}, "id": "tooluse_WXo4u78rQXWcFf_QIXOLLw", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 65, "prompt_tokens": 18372, "total_tokens": 18437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.303897, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 95149, "completion_tokens": 1230, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 200000, "per_turn_token": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "view", "task_list": [], "thought": "Let me create a task tracker to organize my work:"}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 18, "timestamp": "2025-11-05T03:30:05.295612", "source": "agent", "message": "No task list found.

`resolve_document_with_size()`\n\n### File Modified\n- `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n#### 1. ImageBlock.resolve_image_with_size()\n- **Location**: Lines 128-142 (after `resolve_image()` method)\n- **Signature**: `def resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]`\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `as_base64`: Whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n- **Returns**: Tuple of (BytesIO buffer, int size)\n- **Implementation**: Calls `resolve_image()`, calculates size, resets buffer position\n\n#### 2. AudioBlock.resolve_audio_with_size()\n- **Location**: Lines 204-219 (after `resolve_audio()` method)\n- **Signature**: `def resolve_audio_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]`\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `as_base64`: Whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n  - `trim`: Whether to trim leading and trailing null bytes from the audio buffer\n- **Returns**: Tuple of (BytesIO buffer, int size)\n- **Implementation**: Calls `resolve_audio()` with trim parameter, calculates size, resets buffer position\n- **Integration**: Designed to work with Agent 1's modification that adds trim parameter to `resolve_audio()`\n\n#### 3.
