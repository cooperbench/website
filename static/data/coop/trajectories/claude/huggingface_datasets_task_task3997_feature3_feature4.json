Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This limits its usability for diverse data types (especially JSON) and more complex workflows.\n\n**Goal**: Extend the `update` method to:\n1. Support additional types, particularly JSON strings/objects\n2. Enable batch updates for multiple features at once\n3. Maintain compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method\n4. Preserve the existing behavior for standard dict/iterable updates\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Detect and parse JSON input (both string and dict formats)\n- Support batch updates through list of tuples or dict of dicts\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing update behavior\n- Use the existing `__setitem__` method to ensure proper handling of `_column_requires_decoding`\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**Agent 1 (Other Agent) Ownership**:\n- Lines ~23: Modifying functools import to add `lru_cache`\n- Lines 1181-1199: Adding `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` decorator to `require_decoding` function\n- Total line shift from Agent 1: +1 line\n\n**Agent 2 (My) Ownership**:\n- Lines 1249-1257: The `update` method in Features class (after Agent 1's +1 line shift)\n- Original lines were 1248-1256, shifted to 1249-1257 due to Agent 1's decorator addition\n\n**No Conflicts**: \n- Agent 1's changes are in the `require_decoding` function area (before the Features class)\n- My changes are in the Features.update method (inside Features class, ~50 lines later)\n- Clean separation between modification zones\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture**:\n- The `Features` class extends `dict` and maintains a `_column_requires_decoding` internal cache\n- The existing `__setitem__` method (line 1240-1242) handles proper storage and cache updates\n- The `update` method should leverage `__setitem__` to maintain consistency\n- JSON module is already imported (line 18)\n\n**Critical Notes**:\n1.

only if enhanced validation is desired)\n\n**Before Code**: \n```python\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n\n    def __reduce__(self):\n```\n\n**After Code**:\n```python\n            self[key] = kwds[key]\n\n    def _validate_feature_type(self, feature):\n        \"\"\"\n        Internal helper to validate feature types for update operations.\n        \n        Args:\n            feature: Feature object to validate\n            \n        Returns:\n            bool: True if valid feature type\n        \"\"\"\n        # Accept standard feature types\n        from .features import FeatureType\n        valid_types = (dict, list, tuple, Value, Sequence)\n        \n        # Check if it's a known feature type or nested structure\n        if isinstance(feature, valid_types):\n            return True\n        # Check if it has required feature attributes\n        if hasattr(feature, '__class__') and hasattr(feature.__class__, '__mro__'):\n            # Check if it's a dataclass feature (Value, ClassLabel, etc.)\n            return hasattr(feature, '__dataclass_fields__')\n        return False\n\n    def __reduce__(self):\n```\n\n**Critical Details**:\n- This is an OPTIONAL addition for enhanced type validation\n- Only add if you want stricter type checking for the update method\n- If skipped, the existing `__setitem__` method will handle validation\n- Indentation: method at 4 spaces, docstring at 8 spaces, code at 8 spaces\n- The blank line before `def __reduce__` must be preserved\n\n**RECOMMENDATION**: Skip Step 3 unless explicit validation is required. The existing `__setitem__` method already handles type validation appropriately.\n\n## FINAL LINE POSITIONS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**After Agent 1's changes (+1 line shift)**:\n- Original update method: Lines 1248-1256 \u2192 New position: Lines 1249-1257\n\n**After My changes (Step 1 only - recommended)**:\n- Extended update method: Lines 1249-1303 (55 lines, replaces original 9 lines, net +46 lines)\n- Next method `__reduce__`: Shifts from line 1258 to line 1304\n\n**After My changes (Step 1 + Step 3 - if optional validation added)**:\n- Extended update method: Lines 1249-1303 (55 lines)\n- Validation helper: Lines 1305-1327 (23 lines)\n- Next method `__reduce__`: Shifts from line 1258 to line 1328\n\n## TESTING CONSIDERATIONS\n\n**Test scenarios to validate**:\n1. Standard dict update: `features.update({\"col1\": Value(\"int32\")})`\n2. JSON string update: `features.update('{\"col1\": {\"dtype\": \"int32\", \"_type\": \"Value\"}}')`\n3. Batch update with list: `features.update([(\"col1\", Value(\"int32\")), (\"col2\", Value(\"string\"))])`\n4. Keyword argument update: `features.update(col1=Value(\"int32\"), col2=Value(\"string\"))`\n5. Mixed update: `features.update({\"col1\": Value(\"int32\")}, col2=Value(\"string\"))`\n6. Invalid JSON handling: Should raise ValueError\n7. Backward compatibility: Existing code using update should continue to work\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY\n\n**Total Changes**: \n- 1 method replacement (update method)\n- 0 new imports (json already available)\n- Optional: 1 validation helper method (recommended to skip)\n\n**Lines Modified**: \n- Lines 1249-1257 (9 lines) \u2192 Lines 1249-1303 (55 lines)\n- Net change: +46 lines (without optional validation)\n\n**Coordination**: \n- Agent 1's +1 line shift is accounted for in all line numbers\n- No conflicts with Agent 1's require_decoding modifications\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

The enhanced method improves flexibility when working with diverse data types, though it may conflict with the existing decorator-enhanced update method.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `update` method in `Features` only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe method is modified to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates. Careful attention was given to ensure compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method, though there is potential for conflict.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\n**Problem**: The current `update` method in the `Features` class (lines 1248-1256 in original file) only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates. This limits its usability for diverse data types (especially JSON) and more complex workflows.\n\n**Goal**: Extend the `update` method to:\n1. Support additional types, particularly JSON strings/objects\n2. Enable batch updates for multiple features at once\n3. Maintain compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method\n4. Preserve the existing behavior for standard dict/iterable updates\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Detect and parse JSON input (both string and dict formats)\n- Support batch updates through list of tuples or dict of dicts\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing update behavior\n- Use the existing `__setitem__` method to ensure proper handling of `_column_requires_decoding`\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**Agent 1 (Other Agent) Ownership**:\n- Lines ~23: Modifying functools import to add `lru_cache`\n- Lines 1181-1199: Adding `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` decorator to `require_decoding` function\n- Total line shift from Agent 1: +1 line\n\n**Agent 2 (My) Ownership**:\n- Lines 1249-1257: The `update` method in Features class (after Agent 1's +1 line shift)\n- Original lines were 1248-1256, shifted to 1249-1257 due to Agent 1's decorator addition\n\n**No Conflicts**: \n- Agent 1's changes are in the `require_decoding` function area (before the Features class)\n- My changes are in the Features.update method (inside Features class, ~50 lines later)\n- Clean separation between modification zones\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture**:\n- The `Features` class extends `dict` and maintains a `_column_requires_decoding` internal cache\n- The existing `__setitem__` method (line 1240-1242) handles proper storage and cache updates\n- The `update` method should leverage `__setitem__` to maintain consistency\n- JSON module is already imported (line 18)\n\n**Critical Notes**:\n1. The update method must use `self[key] = value` syntax to trigger `__setitem__` and maintain `_column_requires_decoding` consistency\n2. JSON input can be either a JSON string or a dict that needs feature type conversion\n3. Batch updates should iterate and use the same `__setitem__` mechanism\n4. Must maintain backward compatibility with existing dict/iterable/kwargs patterns\n5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The caching mechanism stores results of decoding checks for each feature and reuses them for subsequent checks. This enhancement may impact the synchronization behavior in the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator, and adjustments have been made to accommodate this.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe `require_decoding` function recalculates decoding requirements each time it is called, which can result in unnecessary performance overhead, especially when called multiple times for the same features.\n\n**Solution**:\nA caching mechanism is introduced to store the results of decoding checks for features. This improves performance by reducing redundant calculations. Changes are also made to ensure compatibility with the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Caching for `require_decoding`\n\n## CONTEXT\n\n**Problem:** \nThe `require_decoding` function in `src/datasets/features/features.py` (lines 1181-1198) recalculates decoding requirements each time it is called, which results in unnecessary performance overhead, especially when called multiple times for the same features. The function is called by `__setitem__` (line 1242) and `__delitem__` (line 1246) in the Features class, making caching beneficial.\n\n**Goal:**\nIntroduce a caching mechanism to store the results of decoding checks for features and reuse them for subsequent checks, improving performance by reducing redundant calculations.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add caching to the `require_decoding` function\n2. Ensure compatibility with existing code (no behavioral changes, only performance improvement)\n3. Handle the recursive nature of the function properly (dict, list, tuple, Sequence types)\n4. The feature description mentions potential impact on `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator, but this decorator does NOT exist in the codebase (verified)\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Use Python's `functools.lru_cache` decorator to cache results of `require_decoding` function\n- The function has two parameters: `feature` (FeatureType) and `ignore_decode_attribute` (bool, default False)\n- The function is recursive and handles multiple types: dict, list, tuple, Sequence, and objects with `decode_example` attribute\n- Cache key will be based on both parameters (feature object and ignore_decode_attribute flag)\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n1. The `require_decoding` function is currently at lines 1181-1198\n2. Must handle hashability of feature objects for caching - some FeatureType objects may not be hashable by default\n3. Need to import `functools` at the top of the file (around line 23, after the existing `functools` import of `reduce`)\n4. The function is standalone (not a class method), making it straightforward to apply lru_cache\n5. Need to consider whether features are mutable and if cache invalidation is needed\n\n**Coordination Notes:**\n- Agent 1 is modifying the `update` method in the Features class (lines 1248-1256)\n- Agent 1 may add imports AFTER my functools import\n- No overlap in our implementation areas - clean separation\n- The `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator mentioned in the feature description does not exist in the codebase\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add functools.lru_cache import\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location:** Line 23 (in the existing functools import line)  \n**Action:** Modify  \n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache, reduce\n```\n\n**Critical Details:** \n- This is an existing import line that needs to be extended\n- Line 23 currently imports `reduce` from functools\n- Add `lru_cache` to the same import statement, maintaining alphabetical order\n- Keep all other imports on lines 15-27 unchanged\n- Agent 1 will add any additional imports they need AFTER this section\n\n### Step 2: Apply lru_cache decorator to require_decoding function\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location:** Line 1181 (immediately before the function definition)  \n**Action:** Add decorator  \n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n@lru_cache(maxsize=128)\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` decorator on line 1181 (a new line before the function definition)\n- The decorator should be the only content on the new line 1181\n- The function definition will now start on line 1182 (shifted down by 1 line)\n- Keep all existing function implementation unchanged (lines 1182-1198 in the original, now 1183-1199)\n- The maxsize=128 is chosen as a reasonable cache size for feature type checking\n- This will cache results based on (feature, ignore_decode_attribute) tuple\n- The function body remains completely unchanged - only adding the decorator\n- All existing calls to `require_decoding` (e.g., in `__setitem__` at line 1242) will automatically benefit from caching\n\n**Important:** After this change, the function will span lines 1181-1199 (increased by 1 line due to the decorator). This does NOT conflict with Agent 1's work area (lines 1248-1256 in the original file, which will become lines 1249-1257 after our changes).\n\n### Step 3: Verify no conflicts with other implementations\n**File:** N/A  \n**Action:** Verification step  \n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Agent 1 is implementing changes to the `update` method starting at line 1248\n- Our changes add exactly 1 line (the decorator line), shifting all subsequent lines down by 1\n- Agent 1's `update` method will now be at lines 1249-1257 (shifted by 1 line)\n- No functional conflicts - the changes are completely independent\n- Agent 1 will need to account for this 1-line shift when implementing their changes\n- The caching mechanism is transparent to all callers of `require_decoding`\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThis implementation adds a simple, non-invasive caching mechanism to the `require_decoding` function:\n\n1. **Step 1:** Import `lru_cache` from functools (modify line 23)\n2. **Step 2:** Add `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` decorator before the `require_decoding` function (new line 1181)\n3. **Step 3:** Verification that no conflicts exist with Agent 1's changes\n\n**Total lines added:** 1 (the decorator line)  \n**Total lines modified:** 1 (the import line)  \n**Lines shifted:** All lines after 1181 shift down by 1  \n\n**Agent 1 coordination note:** The line shift of +1 means Agent 1's update method will now be at lines 1249-1257 instead of 1248-1256.\n\n**Testing considerations:**\n- The caching should be transparent to existing functionality\n- Performance improvement will be noticeable when `require_decoding` is called multiple times with the same feature\n- No behavioral changes expected - only performance improvement\n- The cache will automatically handle the recursive calls within the function\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Need to consider whether features are mutable and if cache invalidation is needed\n\n**Coordination Notes:**\n- Agent 1 is modifying the `update` method in the Features class (lines 1248-1256)\n- Agent 1 may add imports AFTER my functools import\n- No overlap in our implementation areas - clean separation\n- The `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator mentioned in the feature description does not exist in the codebase\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add functools.lru_cache import\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location:** Line 23 (in the existing functools import line)  \n**Action:** Modify  \n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache, reduce\n```\n\n**Critical Details:** \n- This is an existing import line that needs to be extended\n- Line 23 currently imports `reduce` from functools\n- Add `lru_cache` to the same import statement, maintaining alphabetical order\n- Keep all other imports on lines 15-27 unchanged\n- Agent 1 will add any additional imports they need AFTER this section\n\n### Step 2: Apply lru_cache decorator to require_decoding function\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location:** Line 1181 (immediately before the function definition)  \n**Action:** Add decorator  \n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n@lru_cache(maxsize=128)\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` decorator on line 1181 (a new line before the function definition)\n- The decorator should be the only content on the new line 1181\n- The function definition will now start on line 1182 (shifted down by 1 line)\n- Keep all existing function implementation unchanged (lines 1182-1198 in the original, now 1183-1199)\n- The maxsize=128 is chosen as a reasonable cache size for feature type checking\n- This will cache results based on (feature, ignore_decode_attribute) tuple\n- The function body remains completely unchanged - only adding the decorator\n- All existing calls to `require_decoding` (e.g., in `__setitem__` at line 1242) will automatically benefit from caching\n\n**Important:** After this change, the function will span lines 1181-1199 (increased by 1 line due to the decorator). This does NOT conflict with Agent 1's work area (lines 1248-1256 in the original file, which will become lines 1249-1257 after our changes).\n\n### Step 3: Verify no conflicts with other implementations\n**File:** N/A  \n**Action:** Verification step  \n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Agent 1 is implementing changes to the `update` method starting at line 1248\n- Our changes add exactly 1 line (the decorator line), shifting all subsequent lines down by 1\n- Agent 1's `update` method will now be at lines 1249-1257 (shifted by 1 line)\n- No functional conflicts - the changes are completely independent\n- Agent 1 will need to account for this 1-line shift when implementing their changes\n- The caching mechanism is transparent to all callers of `require_decoding`\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThis implementation adds a simple, non-invasive caching mechanism to the `require_decoding` function:\n\n1. **Step 1:** Import `lru_cache` from functools (modify line 23)\n2. **Step 2:** Add `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` decorator before the `require_decoding` function (new line 1181)\n3. **Step 3:** Verification that no conflicts exist with Agent 1's changes\n\n**Total lines added:** 1 (the decorator line)  \n**Total lines modified:** 1 (the import line)  \n**Lines shifted:** All lines after 1181 shift down by 1  \n\n**Agent 1 coordination note:** The line shift of +1 means Agent 1's update method will now be at lines 1249-1257 instead of 1248-1256.\n\n**Testing considerations:**\n- The caching should be transparent to existing functionality\n- Performance improvement will be noticeable when `require_decoding` is called multiple times with the same feature\n- No behavioral changes expected - only performance improvement\n- The cache will automatically handle the recursive calls within the function\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2025-11-28T00:14:46.614547", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:53991": 53991, "http://localhost:55765": 55765}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-11-28", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-11-28T00:14:57.344172", "source": "agent", "message": "Running command: cd /workspace && pwd", "action": "run", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "toolu_vrtx_01BuFxrZoiStWyQCpYqYtVih", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-63824d6f-14d1-4d44-8157-af87ccfdffbe", "created": 1764288897, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5@20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I'll start by exploring the repository structure and coordinating with the other agent to avoid merge conflicts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"cd /workspace && pwd\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_vrtx_01BuFxrZoiStWyQCpYqYtVih", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 78, "prompt_tokens": 10862, "total_tokens": 10940, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 10862, "completion_tokens": 78, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 200000, "per_turn_token": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "cd /workspace && pwd", "is_input": false, "thought": "I'll start by exploring the repository structure and coordinating with the other agent to avoid merge conflicts.", "blocking": false, "is_static": false, "cwd": null, "hidden": false, "confirmation_state": "confirmed"}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 6, "timestamp": "2025-11-28T00:14:57.556723", "source": "agent", "message": "Command `cd /workspace && pwd` executed with exit code 0.", "cause": 5, "observation": "run", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "toolu_vrtx_01BuFxrZoiStWyQCpYqYtVih", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-63824d6f-14d1-4d44-8157-af87ccfdffbe", "created": 1764288897, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5@20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I'll start by exploring the repository structure and coordinating with the other agent to avoid merge conflicts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"cd /workspace && pwd\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_vrtx_01BuFxrZoiStWyQCpYqYtVih", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 78, "prompt_tokens": 10862, "total_tokens": 10940, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "/workspace", "extras": {"command": "cd /workspace && pwd", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "openhands", "hostname": "32a90fbcfbb3", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-11-28T00:15:00.473159", "source": "agent", "message": "I am interacting with the MCP server with name:\n```\nopenhands_comm_send\n```\nand arguments:\n```\n{'content': \"Hello!

However, the user mentioned in the guidelines that if the environment is not set up to run tests, I should consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies. But the user also said \"IMPORTANT: YOU SHOULD NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN RESPONSE\" and told me to continue on whatever approach I think is suitable.\n\nGiven this, I have a few options:\n1.
