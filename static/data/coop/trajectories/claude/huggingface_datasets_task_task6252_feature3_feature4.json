Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Goal:** Add optional `crop_margin` parameter to the Image feature that allows users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Add `crop_margin` parameter to Image class\n- Implement cropping logic using Pillow's `crop()` method\n- Crop uniform margin from all four sides during decode\n- Preserve original image center\n- Documentation for the new parameter\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Modify `src/datasets/features/image.py` Image class\n- Add optional `crop_margin: Optional[int] = None` parameter\n- Cropping happens in `decode_example` method after `image.load()` and before mode conversion\n- Uses PIL.Image.crop() with calculated coordinates\n\n**Critical Implementation Notes:**\n1. Cropping occurs BEFORE downscaling (coordinated with Agent 2's max_resolution feature)\n2. Processing pipeline order: Load \u2192 **Crop (this feature)** \u2192 Mode Convert \u2192 Downscale (Agent 2) \u2192 Return\n3. Crop coordinates: (left, top, right, bottom) = (crop_margin, crop_margin, width - crop_margin, height - crop_margin)\n4. Must validate that crop_margin doesn't exceed image dimensions\n\n**Coordination with Agent 2 (max_resolution feature):**\n- Agent 2 adds `max_resolution: Optional[int] = None` at line 87 (after line 86, id parameter)\n- I add `crop_margin: Optional[int] = None` at line 88 (after Agent 2's max_resolution parameter)\n- Agent 2 adds max_resolution documentation first in docstring Args section (lines ~68-72)\n- I add crop_margin documentation after Agent 2's documentation (lines ~73-77)\n- Agent 2 adds downscaling logic after mode conversion (lines ~197-202)\n- I add cropping logic after image.load(), before mode conversion (lines ~189-195)\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n**Location:** Line 88 (new line after Agent 2 adds max_resolution at line 87)\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**After Code (showing both parameters for context, but I only add crop_margin):**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None  # Added by Agent 2\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add this as a new line 88 AFTER Agent 2 adds max_resolution at line 87\n- Keep exact same indentation as other parameters (4 spaces)\n- Ensure comma at end of id parameter line if not already present\n- This parameter comes after max_resolution and before the \"# Automatically constructed\" comment\n\n### Step 2: Add crop_margin documentation to docstring\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n**Location:** Lines ~73-77 (after Agent 2's max_resolution documentation in Args section)\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code (showing context with Agent 2's addition):**\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        max_resolution (`int`, *optional*):  # Added by Agent 2\n            [Agent 2's documentation text]\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Error handling for invalid crop_margin values (too large for image)\n4. Compatibility with other parameters (mode, decode, max_resolution)\n5. Works with all image input types (path, bytes, dict)\n\n## DEPENDENCIES\n\n- Pillow (PIL) - already imported and used in the file\n- No additional imports required\n- Uses existing `PIL.Image.crop()` method with standard coordinate system\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\n**Problem:** Some datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Goal:** Add optional `crop_margin` parameter to the Image feature that allows users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Add `crop_margin` parameter to Image class\n- Implement cropping logic using Pillow's `crop()` method\n- Crop uniform margin from all four sides during decode\n- Preserve original image center\n- Documentation for the new parameter\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Modify `src/datasets/features/image.py` Image class\n- Add optional `crop_margin: Optional[int] = None` parameter\n- Cropping happens in `decode_example` method after `image.load()` and before mode conversion\n- Uses PIL.Image.crop() with calculated coordinates\n\n**Critical Implementation Notes:**\n1. Cropping occurs BEFORE downscaling (coordinated with Agent 2's max_resolution feature)\n2. Processing pipeline order: Load \u2192 **Crop (this feature)** \u2192 Mode Convert \u2192 Downscale (Agent 2) \u2192 Return\n3. Crop coordinates: (left, top, right, bottom) = (crop_margin, crop_margin, width - crop_margin, height - crop_margin)\n4. Must validate that crop_margin doesn't exceed image dimensions\n\n**Coordination with Agent 2 (max_resolution feature):**\n- Agent 2 adds `max_resolution: Optional[int] = None` at line 87 (after line 86, id parameter)\n- I add `crop_margin: Optional[int] = None` at line 88 (after Agent 2's max_resolution parameter)\n- Agent 2 adds max_resolution documentation first in docstring Args section (lines ~68-72)\n- I add crop_margin documentation after Agent 2's documentation (lines ~73-77)\n- Agent 2 adds downscaling logic after mode conversion (lines ~197-202)\n- I add cropping logic after image.load(), before mode conversion (lines ~189-195)\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n**Location:** Line 88 (new line after Agent 2 adds max_resolution at line 87)\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**After Code (showing both parameters for context, but I only add crop_margin):**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[int] = None  # Added by Agent 2\n    crop_margin: Optional[int] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add this as a new line 88 AFTER Agent 2 adds max_resolution at line 87\n- Keep exact same indentation as other parameters (4 spaces)\n- Ensure comma at end of id parameter line if not already present\n- This parameter comes after max_resolution and before the \"# Automatically constructed\" comment\n\n### Step 2: Add crop_margin documentation to docstring\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n**Location:** Lines ~73-77 (after Agent 2's max_resolution documentation in Args section)\n**Action:** Add\n\n**Before Code (showing context with Agent 2's addition):**\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Goal:** Introduce an optional `max_resolution` parameter to the `Image` feature that enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Add `max_resolution` parameter to Image class\n- Implement proportional downscaling logic in decode_example method\n- Maintain aspect ratio during downscaling\n- Only downscale if image exceeds threshold\n- Update docstring documentation\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- The Image class is a dataclass with parameters: mode, decode, id (lines 84-86)\n- The decode_example method (lines 134-191) handles image decoding from path/bytes\n- Image processing happens after image.load() at line 188\n- Current flow: Load \u2192 Mode Convert \u2192 Return\n\n**New Flow (Coordinated with Agent 1's crop_margin feature):**\n- Load \u2192 Crop (Agent 1) \u2192 Mode Convert \u2192 Downscale (Agent 2/Mine) \u2192 Return\n\n**Critical Notes:**\n- Agent 1 adds crop_margin parameter on line 88 (after my max_resolution on line 87)\n- Agent 1 adds cropping logic at lines ~189-195 (before mode conversion)\n- I add downscaling logic at lines ~197-202 (after mode conversion)\n- Agent 1 adds crop_margin docs at lines ~73-77 (after my max_resolution docs)\n- Use Pillow's thumbnail() method: `image.thumbnail((max_resolution, max_resolution), PIL.Image.LANCZOS)`\n- thumbnail() modifies in-place and maintains aspect ratio\n- Only apply if max_resolution is set and image exceeds threshold\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**Shared File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**Agent 1 (crop_margin feature) handles:**\n- Line 88: Adding crop_margin parameter (after my max_resolution)\n- Lines ~73-77: Adding crop_margin documentation (after my max_resolution docs)\n- Lines ~189-195: Adding cropping logic (after image.load(), before mode conversion)\n\n**I handle (max_resolution feature):**\n- Line 87: Adding max_resolution parameter (immediately after line 86)\n- Lines ~68-72: Adding max_resolution documentation (after decode parameter docs)\n- Lines ~197-202: Adding downscaling logic (after mode conversion)\n\n**Processing Order in decode_example:**\n1. image.load() - existing line 188\n2. Cropping logic - Agent 1 owns lines ~189-195\n3. Mode conversion - existing lines 189-190, will shift to ~195-196\n4. Downscaling logic - I own lines ~197-202\n5.

Documentation Addition (Lines 68-70)\\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\\n**Location:** Lines 68-70 (in the Args section of the Image class docstring)\\n\\n```python\\nmax_resolution (`int`, *optional*):\\n    Maximum width or height for the image. If the image exceeds this threshold in either dimension,\\n    it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\\n```\\n\\n### 3.
