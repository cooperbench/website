Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Goal:** Add an optional `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class that enables automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add `crop_to_square: bool = False` parameter to the Image class constructor\n2. Apply center-cropping before mode conversion in the `decode_example()` method\n3. Maintain backward compatibility (opt-in feature)\n4. Coordinate with Agent 1's EXIF orientation correction feature\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**Shared File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**Agent 1's Changes (EXIF Orientation Correction):**\n- Line 189: Adds `from PIL import ImageOps` import\n- Line 190: Adds `image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)` for EXIF correction\n\n**My Changes (Center-Crop to Square):**\n- Lines 84-86: I OWN the constructor - adding `crop_to_square` parameter\n- Line 191+: I add center-crop logic AFTER Agent 1's EXIF correction (lines 189-190)\n\n**Processing Pipeline Order:**\n1. Load image with PIL (existing, lines 169-187)\n2. Call image.load() (existing, line 188)\n3. Apply EXIF orientation correction (Agent 1's feature, lines 189-190)\n4. Apply center-crop to square (MY feature, starting line 191)\n5. Apply mode conversion (existing, will be pushed down after my changes)\n\n**No Conflicts:** Clean sequential additions with clear ownership boundaries.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- The `Image` class is a dataclass (using `@dataclass` decorator) located in `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n- Current constructor parameters (lines 84-86): `mode`, `decode`, `id`\n- The `decode_example()` method (lines 134-191) handles image decoding and transformations\n\n**Critical Implementation Notes:**\n1. The crop must use the minimum dimension (shorter side) as the reference for the square size\n2. Center-cropping formula: \n   - `width, height = image.size`\n   - `min_dim = min(width, height)`\n   - `left = (width - min_dim) // 2`\n   - `top = (height - min_dim) // 2`\n   - `right = left + min_dim`\n   - `bottom = top + min_dim`\n   - `image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))`\n3. The crop must be applied AFTER Agent 1's EXIF correction (line 190) and BEFORE mode conversion\n4. PIL's `crop()` method is already available through `PIL.Image` - no additional imports needed\n5. Must maintain backward compatibility by making the parameter optional with default `False`\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class constructor\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`  \n**Location:** Line 86 (add new line after the `id` parameter)  \n**Action:** Add new parameter line\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add the new line EXACTLY at line 86 (between `id: Optional[str] = None` and the comment `# Automatically constructed`)\n- Use the same indentation level as the other parameters (4 spaces)\n- Set default value to `False` to maintain backward compatibility\n- The parameter type is `bool` with no Optional wrapper\n- Leave a blank line after the parameter before the comment\n\n### Step 2: Add center-cropping logic in decode_example method\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`  \n**Location:** Line 191 (after Agent 1's EXIF correction at line 190, before mode conversion)  \n**Action:** Add conditional center-crop logic\n\n**Context - What comes before (Agent 1's changes):**\n```python\n        image.load()  # line 188\n        from PIL import ImageOps  # line 189 (Agent 1's addition)\n        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)  # line 190 (Agent 1's addition)\n```\n\n**After Code (MY ADDITION starting at line 191):**\n```python\n        # Apply center-crop to square if requested\n        if self.crop_to_square:\n            width, height = image.size\n            min_dim = min(width, height)\n            left = (width - min_dim) // 2\n            top = (height - min_dim) // 2\n            right = left + min_dim\n            bottom = top + min_dim\n            image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n```\n\n**Context - What comes after:**\n```python\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:  # mode conversion (now pushed down)\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add this code block starting at line 191, immediately after Agent 1's line 190\n- Use 8-space indentation (2 levels: 4 for method, 4 for the if block)\n- Add a comment line before the if statement: `# Apply center-crop to square if requested`\n- The conditional `if self.crop_to_square:` checks if the feature is enabled\n- Inside the if block (12-space indentation):\n  - Line 1: `width, height = image.size` - get current image dimensions\n  - Line 2: `min_dim = min(width, height)` - find the shorter side\n  - Line 3: `left = (width - min_dim) // 2` - calculate left edge (center horizontally)\n  - Line 4: `top = (height - min_dim) // 2` - calculate top edge (center vertically)\n  - Line 5: `right = left + min_dim` - calculate right edge\n  - Line 6: `bottom = top + min_dim` - calculate bottom edge\n  - Line 7: `image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))` - perform the crop with a 4-tuple\n- Use integer division `//` to ensure integer coordinates\n- The `crop()` method takes a 4-tuple: `(left, top, right, bottom)` in absolute pixel coordinates\n- Do NOT add any blank lines between the new code and the existing mode conversion code\n- The existing mode conversion code (lines 189-190 in original) will automatically be pushed down\n\n### Step 3: Verify the complete method structure\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`  \n**Location:** Lines 188-201 (after all changes)  \n**Action:** Verification reference\n\n**Expected final structure of the decode_example method ending:**\n```python\n        image.load()  # line 188 (existing)\n        from PIL import ImageOps  # line 189 (Agent 1)\n        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)  # line 190 (Agent 1)\n        # Apply center-crop to square if requested  # line 191 (MY addition)\n        if self.crop_to_square:  # line 192 (MY addition)\n            width, height = image.size  # line 193 (MY addition)\n            min_dim = min(width, height)  # line 194 (MY addition)\n            left = (width - min_dim) // 2  # line 195 (MY addition)\n            top = (height - min_dim) // 2  # line 196 (MY addition)\n            right = left + min_dim  # line 197 (MY addition)\n            bottom = top + min_dim  # line 198 (MY addition)\n            image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))  # line 199 (MY addition)\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:  # line 200 (existing, pushed down)\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)  # line 201 (existing, pushed down)\n        return image  # line 202 (existing, pushed down)\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- The total addition is 9 lines (1 comment + 8 code lines)\n- Agent 1 adds 2 lines (189-190)\n- I add 9 lines (191-199)\n- Original mode conversion (lines 189-190) moves to lines 200-201\n- Original return statement (line 191) moves to line 202\n- Maintain all existing indentation levels\n- No additional imports are needed (PIL.Image is already imported at line 156)\n\n## VALIDATION NOTES\n\n**Testing considerations:**\n1. Test with `crop_to_square=False` (default) - should behave exactly as before\n2. Test with `crop_to_square=True` on landscape images (width > height)\n3. Test with `crop_to_square=True` on portrait images (height > width)\n4. Test with `crop_to_square=True` on already-square images (width == height)\n5. Verify the crop is centered correctly by checking pixel coordinates\n6. Verify crop happens AFTER EXIF correction (so orientation is correct before cropping)\n7. Verify crop happens BEFORE mode conversion\n\n**Example usage:**\n```python\nfrom datasets import Image\n\n# Enable center-crop to square\nfeature = Image(decode=True, crop_to_square=True)\n\n# Decode an image - will be automatically cropped to square\nimage = feature.decode_example({\"path\": \"example.jpg\", \"bytes\": None})\n# If original was 640x480, result will be 480x480 (centered crop)\n```\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThis implementation adds an optional center-cropping feature that integrates seamlessly with Agent 1's EXIF orientation correction. The changes are minimal, focused, and maintain full backward compatibility. The feature is disabled by default, ensuring existing code continues to work without modification.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

Test with `crop_to_square=False` (default) - should behave exactly as before\n2. Test with `crop_to_square=True` on landscape images (width > height)\n3. Test with `crop_to_square=True` on portrait images (height > width)\n4. Test with `crop_to_square=True` on already-square images (width == height)\n5. Verify the crop is centered correctly by checking pixel coordinates\n6. Verify crop happens AFTER EXIF correction (so orientation is correct before cropping)\n7. Verify crop happens BEFORE mode conversion\n\n**Example usage:**\n```python\nfrom datasets import Image\n\n# Enable center-crop to square\nfeature = Image(decode=True, crop_to_square=True)\n\n# Decode an image - will be automatically cropped to square\nimage = feature.decode_example({\"path\": \"example.jpg\", \"bytes\": None})\n# If original was 640x480, result will be 480x480 (centered crop)\n```\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThis implementation adds an optional center-cropping feature that integrates seamlessly with Agent 1's EXIF orientation correction. The changes are minimal, focused, and maintain full backward compatibility. The feature is disabled by default, ensuring existing code continues to work without modification.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\n**Problem:** Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Goal:** Add an optional `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class that enables automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add `crop_to_square: bool = False` parameter to the Image class constructor\n2. Apply center-cropping before mode conversion in the `decode_example()` method\n3. Maintain backward compatibility (opt-in feature)\n4. Coordinate with Agent 1's EXIF orientation correction feature\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n**Shared File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**Agent 1's Changes (EXIF Orientation Correction):**\n- Line 189: Adds `from PIL import ImageOps` import\n- Line 190: Adds `image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)` for EXIF correction\n\n**My Changes (Center-Crop to Square):**\n- Lines 84-86: I OWN the constructor - adding `crop_to_square` parameter\n- Line 191+: I add center-crop logic AFTER Agent 1's EXIF correction (lines 189-190)\n\n**Processing Pipeline Order:**\n1. Load image with PIL (existing, lines 169-187)\n2. Call image.load() (existing, line 188)\n3. Apply EXIF orientation correction (Agent 1's feature, lines 189-190)\n4. Apply center-crop to square (MY feature, starting line 191)\n5. Apply mode conversion (existing, will be pushed down after my changes)\n\n**No Conflicts:** Clean sequential additions with clear ownership boundaries.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture:**\n- The `Image` class is a dataclass (using `@dataclass` decorator) located in `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n- Current constructor parameters (lines 84-86): `mode`, `decode`, `id`\n- The `decode_example()` method (lines 134-191) handles image decoding and transformations\n\n**Critical Implementation Notes:**\n1. The crop must use the minimum dimension (shorter side) as the reference for the square size\n2. Center-cropping formula: \n   - `width, height = image.size`\n   - `min_dim = min(width, height)`\n   - `left = (width - min_dim) // 2`\n   - `top = (height - min_dim) // 2`\n   - `right = left + min_dim`\n   - `bottom = top + min_dim`\n   - `image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))`\n3. The crop must be applied AFTER Agent 1's EXIF correction (line 190) and BEFORE mode conversion\n4. PIL's `crop()` method is already available through `PIL.Image` - no additional imports needed\n5. Must maintain backward compatibility by making the parameter optional with default `False`\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class constructor\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`  \n**Location:** Line 86 (add new line after the `id` parameter)  \n**Action:** Add new parameter line\n\n**Before Code:**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**After Code:**\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n    # Automatically constructed\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- Add the new line EXACTLY at line 86 (between `id: Optional[str] = None` and the comment `# Automatically constructed`)\n- Use the same indentation level as the other parameters (4 spaces)\n- Set default value to `False` to maintain backward compatibility\n- The parameter type is `bool` with no Optional wrapper\n- Leave a blank line after the parameter before the comment\n\n### Step 2: Add center-cropping logic in decode_example method\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`  \n**Location:** Line 191 (after Agent 1's EXIF correction at line 190, before mode conversion)  \n**Action:** Add conditional center-crop logic\n\n**Context -

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The feature automatically corrects images with EXIF orientation metadata during the decoding process.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- File: src/datasets/features/image.py\n- Method: decode_example (lines 134-193)\n- Changes:\n  * Line 189: `from PIL import ImageOps` (inline import)\n  * Line 190: `image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)` (automatic correction)\n\n**Key Features:**\n\u2705 Automatic correction - no configuration needed\n\u2705 Gracefully handles images with or without EXIF data\n\u2705 Applied before any other transformations (crop, mode conversion)\n\u2705 Follows existing code patterns (inline imports)\n\u2705 Syntax validated and tested\n\n**Coordination:**\n\u2705 No conflicts with Agent 2's crop_to_square feature\n\u2705 Agent 2's changes will come after my EXIF correction in the pipeline\n\u2705 Clean sequential additions - no overlapping line modifications\n\n**Processing Pipeline:**\n1. Load image \u2192 2. image.load() \u2192 3. EXIF correction (NEW) \u2192 4. Agent 2's crop (pending) \u2192 5. Mode conversion \u2192 6.
