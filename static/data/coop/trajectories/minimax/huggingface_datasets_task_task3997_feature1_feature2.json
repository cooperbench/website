Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`.

The enhancement allows for more flexible control over the decoding process, enabling users to define their own conditions for whether a feature requires decoding.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `require_decoding` function only uses predefined rules to determine whether a feature requires decoding, limiting customization for complex datasets.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new extension to `require_decoding` allows users to define custom decoding conditions, using metadata or specific feature properties.

Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Sync Features Dictionaries\n\n## CONTEXT\nI'm implementing a synchronization decorator for the `Features` class to keep the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary. This ensures consistency when features are added, removed, or modified.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nThe `Features` class inherits from `dict` and has a `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary that tracks whether each column requires decoding. Currently, only `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` are manually synchronized, but methods like `pop`, `clear`, `setdefault`, and others are not.\n\nMy solution is a class decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` that wraps the `Features` class and overrides key dictionary methods to maintain synchronization automatically.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- **Shared File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n- **Other Agent**: Will implement \"Custom require_decoding Criteria\" feature second, which will read from the synchronized `_column_requires_decoding`\n- **Compatibility**: My decorator preserves all existing method signatures and functionality, ensuring seamless integration\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add the synchronization decorator\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n**Location**: After line 1200, before the Features class definition (lines 1201)\n**Action**: Add new code block\n**Before Code**: [blank lines 1200-1201]\n**After Code**: \n```python\ndef keep_features_dicts_synced(cls):\n    \"\"\"Class decorator to keep _column_requires_decoding synchronized with the main dictionary.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Store the original methods\n    original_init = cls.__init__\n    original_setitem = cls.__setitem__\n    original_delitem = cls.__delitem__\n    original_pop = getattr(cls, 'pop', dict.pop)\n    original_clear = getattr(cls, 'clear', dict.clear)\n    original_setdefault = getattr(cls, 'setdefault', dict.setdefault)\n    original_update = cls.update\n    original_ior = getattr(cls, '__ior__', dict.__ior__)\n    \n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        # Ensure _column_requires_decoding is properly initialized\n        if not hasattr(self, '_column_requires_decoding'):\n            self._column_requires_decoding = {}\n        # Sync any existing items\n        for column_name, feature in self.items():\n            self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n    \n    def __setitem__(self, column_name, feature):\n        original_setitem(self, column_name, feature)\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n    \n    def __delitem__(self, column_name):\n        original_delitem(self, column_name)\n        if column_name in self._column_requires_decoding:\n            del self._column_requires_decoding[column_name]\n    \n    def pop(self, key, *args):\n        result = original_pop(self, key, *args)\n        if key in self._column_requires_decoding:\n            del self._column_requires_decoding[key]\n        return result\n    \n    def clear(self):\n        original_clear(self)\n        self._column_requires_decoding.clear()\n    \n    def setdefault(self, key, default=None):\n        result = original_setdefault(self, key, default)\n        self._column_requires_decoding[key] = require_decoding(result)\n        return result\n    \n    def update(self, iterable, **kwds):\n        original_update(self, iterable, **kwds)\n        # update() already calls __setitem__ for each key, which handles sync\n    \n    def __ior__(self, other):\n        result = original_ior(self, other)\n        # __ior__ (|=) already calls update internally, which handles sync\n        return result\n    \n    # Replace the methods with our synchronized versions\n    cls.__init__ = __init__\n    cls.__setitem__ = __setitem__\n    cls.__delitem__ = __delitem__\n    cls.pop = pop\n    cls.clear = clear\n    cls.setdefault = setdefault\n    cls.update = update\n    cls.__ior__ = __ior__\n    \n    return cls\n\n\n@keep_features_dicts_synced\nclass Features(dict):\n    # ... existing class definition continues unchanged\n```\n\n### Step 2: Verify compatibility with existing methods\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n**Location**: Check existing `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` methods (lines 1240-1246)\n**Action**: Review - no changes needed\n**Critical Details**: The existing `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` methods in the Features class (lines 1240-1246) are now redundant since the decorator provides the same functionality. However, I'll keep them as they are since they won't cause conflicts - the decorator will simply override them with synchronized versions.\n\n### Step 3: Test the implementation\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n**Location**: Add test validation (temporarily for verification)\n**Action**: Add a simple test to verify synchronization\n**Before Code**: [none]\n**After Code**: \n```python\n# Temporary test - remove after verification\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    from . import Value\n    features = Features({\"col1\": Value(\"string\"), \"col2\": Value(\"int64\")})\n    print(\"Initial sync check:\", features._column_requires_decoding)\n    \n    # Test adding a new column\n    features[\"col3\"] = Value(\"float32\")\n    print(\"After adding col3:\", features._column_requires_decoding)\n    \n    # Test removing a column\n    del features[\"col1\"]\n    print(\"After removing col1:\", features._column_requires_decoding)\n    \n    # Test pop\n    popped = features.pop(\"col2\")\n    print(\"After popping col2:\", features._column_requires_decoding)\n    \n    # Test clear\n    features.clear()\n    print(\"After clear:\", features._column_requires_decoding)\n```\n\n## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\n1. **Method Chaining**: The decorator calls the original method first, then synchronizes\n2. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing method signatures are preserved\n3. **Performance**: Minimal overhead - synchronization happens only on modifications\n4. **Integration**: The decorator works seamlessly with the existing `update` method which relies on `__setitem__`\n\n## EXPECTED OUTCOME\nAfter implementation:\n- All dictionary modification operations will automatically sync `_column_requires_decoding`\n- The existing manual `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` methods become redundant but harmless\n- Custom criteria feature (implemented by the other agent) can safely read from `_column_requires_decoding` knowing it's always synchronized\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2025-11-13T08:36:18.872266", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:50636": 50636, "http://localhost:55770": 55770}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-11-13", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 7, "timestamp": "2025-11-13T08:36:22.281007", "source": "agent", "message": "Managing 6 task items.", "action": "task_tracking", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "task_tracker", "tool_call_id": "call_function_zg33m5rvyjsc_1", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-4784dc69-e66b-43c0-bc72-07a4522d1708", "created": 1763022982, "model": "MiniMax-M2", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"plan\", \"task_list\": [{\"id\": \"1\", \"notes\": \"Examine the features.py file to understand current structure and locate the require_decoding function and Features class\", \"status\": \"in_progress\", \"title\": \"Explore current codebase structure\"}, {\"id\": \"2\", \"notes\": \"Add Callable import to typing imports in features.py\", \"status\": \"todo\", \"title\": \"Update type imports\"}, {\"id\": \"3\", \"notes\": \"Replace existing require_decoding function with enhanced version supporting custom_criteria parameter\", \"status\": \"todo\", \"title\": \"Extend require_decoding function\"}, {\"id\": \"4\", \"notes\": \"Modify Features.__init__ to support custom_decoding_criteria parameter\", \"status\": \"todo\", \"title\": \"Update Features constructor\"}, {\"id\": \"5\", \"notes\": \"Implement register_custom_decoding_criteria, unregister_custom_decoding_criteria, and require_decoding_with_criteria methods\", \"status\": \"todo\", \"title\": \"Add custom criteria registration methods\"}, {\"id\": \"6\", \"notes\": \"Verify all changes work correctly and maintain backward compatibility\", \"status\": \"todo\", \"title\": \"Test implementation\"}]}", "name": "task_tracker"}, "id": "call_function_zg33m5rvyjsc_1", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "I need to create a task list first to track my work on this feature implementation.", "thinking_blocks": [{"type": "thinking", "thinking": "I need to create a task list first to track my work on this feature implementation.", "signature": "06b036d5a110f760d4789e49476436dc8230cdb1676cfdfade79f4626e5d66b8"}]}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 9028, "total_tokens": 9324, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 17, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 17970, "completion_tokens": 578, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 0, "per_turn_token": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "plan", "task_list": [{"id": "1", "notes": "Examine the features.py file to understand current structure and locate the require_decoding function and Features class", "status": "in_progress", "title": "Explore current codebase structure"}, {"id": "2", "notes": "Add Callable import to typing imports in features.py", "status": "todo", "title": "Update type imports"}, {"id": "3", "notes": "Replace existing require_decoding function with enhanced version supporting custom_criteria parameter", "status": "todo", "title": "Extend require_decoding function"}, {"id": "4", "notes": "Modify Features.__init__ to support custom_decoding_criteria parameter", "status": "todo", "title": "Update Features constructor"}, {"id": "5", "notes": "Implement register_custom_decoding_criteria, unregister_custom_decoding_criteria, and require_decoding_with_criteria methods", "status": "todo", "title": "Add custom criteria registration methods"}, {"id": "6", "notes": "Verify all changes work correctly and maintain backward compatibility", "status": "todo", "title": "Test implementation"}], "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 8, "timestamp": "2025-11-13T08:36:22.309549", "source": "agent", "message": "Task list has been updated with 6 items.

This suggests the core implementation is functioning, and the test's lack of data might indicate a different underlying issue.\n\nI'll investigate by simplifying the test scenario and carefully tracing the method execution sequence.\n\nRunning the test in isolation could provide clearer insights into why the synchronization isn't working as expected.", "signature": "7bf43294305e91fc095165bd2f218f45eeb5f0d03e2ce9bceb89a7a58431b7bd"}]}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1102, "prompt_tokens": 31739, "total_tokens": 32841, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 711, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "The file /workspace/test_sync_decorator.py has been edited.
