Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

The original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged for backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n* llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- **Other Agent**: Will modify existing `resolve_audio()` method in `AudioBlock` class (lines 173-186)\n- **My Implementation**: Adding entirely NEW methods that will be placed after existing resolve methods in each class\n- **File Ownership**: Both agents share `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py` with clear separation of responsibilities\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add `resolve_image_with_size()` method to ImageBlock class\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: After existing `resolve_image()` method (line 126-127, add on new lines 127-138)\n**Action**: Add new method\n\n**Code to Add**:\n```python\ndef resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolve an image and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n    Args:\n        as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[BytesIO, int]: A tuple containing the resolved image buffer and its byte size\n    \"\"\"\n    buffer = resolve_binary(\n        raw_bytes=self.image,\n        path=self.path,\n        url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n        as_base64=as_base64,\n    )\n    \n    # Get current position and seek to end to get size\n    current_pos = buffer.tell()\n    buffer.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to end\n    size = buffer.tell()\n    buffer.seek(current_pos)  # Restore original position\n    \n    return buffer, size\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add `resolve_audio_with_size()` method to AudioBlock class\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: After existing `resolve_audio()` method (line 186-187, add on new lines 187-198)\n**Action**: Add new method\n\n**Code to Add**:\n```python\ndef resolve_audio_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolve an audio and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n    Args:\n        as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[BytesIO, int]: A tuple containing the resolved audio buffer and its byte size\n    \"\"\"\n    buffer = resolve_binary(\n        raw_bytes=self.audio,\n        path=self.path,\n        url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n        as_base64=as_base64,\n    )\n    \n    # Get current position and seek to end to get size\n    current_pos = buffer.tell()\n    buffer.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to end\n    size = buffer.tell()\n    buffer.seek(current_pos)  # Restore original position\n    \n    return buffer, size\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add `resolve_document_with_size()` method to DocumentBlock class\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: After existing `resolve_document()` method (line 223-224, add on new lines 224-235)\n**Action**: Add new method\n\n**Code to Add**:\n```python\ndef resolve_document_with_size(self) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolve a document and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[BytesIO, int]: A tuple containing the resolved document buffer and its byte size\n    \"\"\"\n    buffer = resolve_binary(\n        raw_bytes=self.data,\n        path=self.path,\n        url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n        as_base64=False,\n    )\n    \n    # Get current position and seek to end to get size\n    current_pos = buffer.tell()\n    buffer.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to end\n    size = buffer.tell()\n    buffer.seek(current_pos)  # Restore original position\n    \n    return buffer, size\n```\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n### Key Implementation Points:\n1. **Backward Compatibility**: Original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged\n2. **Size Calculation**: Uses `buffer.seek(0, 2)` to get byte size without consuming the buffer\n3. **Position Preservation**: Saves and restores original buffer position to avoid side effects\n4. **Return Type**: All methods return `tuple[BytesIO, int]` as specified\n\n### Code Style:\n- Follows existing method documentation patterns\n- Maintains consistent parameter naming (`as_base64` where applicable)\n- Uses same `resolve_binary` calls as original methods\n\n### Coordination Benefits:\n- **Clean Separation**: New methods don't interfere with existing functionality\n- **No Line Conflicts**: Placed after existing methods (lines 127, 187, 224)\n- **Clear Intent**: Each method has distinct name to avoid confusion with originals\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

By eliminating extraneous padding, this enhancement ensures that buffer size calculations are accurate and that consumers of the audio data work with a clean, byte-exact representation. This reduces inconsistencies during testing and improves interoperability with systems that rely on precise buffer contents.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nCurrently, audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio_with_size()` may contain unintended null padding at the beginning or end of the stream.

By eliminating extraneous padding, this enhancement ensures that buffer size calculations are accurate and that consumers of the audio data work with a clean, byte-exact representation. This reduces inconsistencies during testing and improves interoperability with systems that rely on precise buffer contents.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nCurrently, audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio_with_size()` may contain unintended null padding at the beginning or end of the stream. This can lead to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, or unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders or file writers expecting tightly packed data.\n\n**Solution**\nThe implementation trims leading and trailing `b'\\x00'` bytes from the raw audio buffer after resolution and before computing its size. This ensures that only meaningful audio data is returned, leading to more deterministic behavior and preventing false negatives in tests that compare buffer contents directly.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n**Problem**: Audio buffers returned by `resolve_audio()` may contain unintended null padding at the beginning or end of the stream, leading to discrepancies during equality checks, incorrect size reporting, and unexpected behavior when interfacing with audio decoders.\n\n**Goal**: Add trimming of leading and trailing null bytes (`b'\\x00'`) from audio buffers to ensure accurate size validation and cleaner downstream processing.\n\n**Requirements**: \n- Add `trim: bool = False` parameter to existing `resolve_audio()` method\n- When `trim=True`, remove leading and trailing null bytes from the resolved audio buffer\n- Maintain backward compatibility (default `trim=False`)\n- Ensure buffer size calculations are accurate after trimming\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- **File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- **Class**: `AudioBlock` \n- **Method**: `resolve_audio()` at lines 173-186\n- **Approach**: Modify existing method signature and implementation, add trimming logic after `resolve_binary()` call\n- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes, only adding optional parameter\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify resolve_audio() method signature\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: Line 173 (method signature)\n**Action**: Replace\n**Before Code**:\n```python\ndef resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n```\n**After Code**:\n```python\ndef resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False, trim: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n```\n**Critical Details**: Maintain exact same indentation and spacing\n\n### Step 2: Update resolve_audio() docstring\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: Lines 174-180 (docstring)\n**Action**: Replace\n**Before Code**:\n```\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n        \"\"\"\n```\n**After Code**:\n```\n        \"\"\"\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\n\n        Args:\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n            trim (bool): whether to remove leading and trailing null bytes from the audio buffer\n\n        \"\"\"\n```\n**Critical Details**: Preserve exact formatting and indentation\n\n### Step 3: Implement trimming logic in resolve_audio()\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: Lines 181-187 (method body)\n**Action**: Replace\n**Before Code**:\n```python\n        return resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n```\n**After Code**:\n```python\n        resolved_buffer = resolve_binary(\n            raw_bytes=self.audio,\n            path=self.path,\n            url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n            as_base64=as_base64,\n        )\n        \n        if trim:\n            #

I'm not touching the existing methods - only adding new methods after them.\n\nIs this coordinate plan okay to proceed with?", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 17, "timestamp": "2025-11-09T18:30:42.650879", "source": "agent", "message": "I edited the file /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py.", "cause": 14, "observation": "edit", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "call_function_7htph68q4at5_1", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-11b606be-1a05-444d-a696-b61a78973ead", "created": 1762713042, "model": "MiniMax-M2", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "Now Step 2: Update the docstring to include the trim parameter.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 2, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"new_str\": \"        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\\n            trim (bool): whether to remove leading and trailing null bytes from the audio buffer\\n\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\", \"old_str\": \"        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\\n\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\", \"path\": \"/workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "call_function_7htph68q4at5_1", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "Good, step 1 is complete.
