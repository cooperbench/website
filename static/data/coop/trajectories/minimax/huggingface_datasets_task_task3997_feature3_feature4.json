Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Changes are also made to ensure compatibility with the `keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Caching for `require_decoding`\n\n## CONTEXT: Problem, Goal, Requirements\n**Problem**: The `require_decoding` function recalculates decoding requirements each time it's called, causing unnecessary performance overhead when called multiple times for the same features.\n\n**Goal**: Implement a caching mechanism that stores and reuses results of decoding checks to improve performance while maintaining exact same behavior and compatibility.\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Maintain identical function signature and return behavior\n- Add performance caching without changing external API\n- Ensure compatibility with any existing or future decorators\n- Handle recursive nature of the function\n- Consider memory usage of cache\n- No conflicts with other agent's `update` method changes\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n**Current Function Location**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`, lines 1181-1198\n\n**Key Challenge**: Feature objects may not be directly hashable, so cache key creation needs careful handling.\n\n**Cache Strategy**:\n- Use module-level dictionary cache\n- Create cache key using feature type and relevant attributes\n- Handle different feature types (dict, list, tuple, Sequence, others)\n- Store both parameter combination (feature + ignore_decode_attribute)\n\n**Cache Invalidation**: \n- Module-level cache persists for session\n- Suitable for features that don't change frequently\n- Consider manual cache clearing for long-running applications\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add module-level cache dictionary\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location**: Line ~1179 (before the `require_decoding` function)  \n**Action**: Add  \n**Before Code**: [none - new addition]  \n**After Code**:\n```python\n# Cache for require_decoding function to avoid redundant calculations\n_require_decoding_cache = {}\n```  \n**Critical Details**: Place at module level, before function definition, with clear comment explaining purpose\n\n### Step 2: Create cache key generation function\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location**: Line ~1180 (between cache dict and require_decoding function)  \n**Action**: Add  \n**Before Code**: [none - new addition]  \n**After Code**:\n```python\ndef _make_require_decoding_cache_key(feature, ignore_decode_attribute):\n    \"\"\"Create a cache key for the require_decoding function.\"\"\"\n    # Handle different feature types for caching\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        # For dict features, use sorted items for consistent caching\n        return ('dict', tuple(sorted(feature.items())), ignore_decode_attribute)\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        # For list/tuple features, use first element\n        return (type(feature).__name__, id(feature[0]) if feature else None, ignore_decode_attribute)\n    elif hasattr(feature, '__dict__'):\n        # For objects with attributes, use type and relevant attributes\n        feature_type = type(feature).__name__\n        # Check for common attributes that might affect decoding\n        relevant_attrs = []\n        if hasattr(feature, 'decode'):\n            relevant_attrs.append(('decode', feature.decode))\n        if hasattr(feature, 'decode_example'):\n            relevant_attrs.append(('decode_example', feature.decode_example))\n        return (feature_type, tuple(relevant_attrs), ignore_decode_attribute)\n    else:\n        # For basic types, use type and value\n        return (type(feature).__name__, str(feature), ignore_decode_attribute)\n```  \n**Critical Details**: Handle all feature types the main function processes, ensure consistent keys\n\n### Step 3: Modify require_decoding function with caching\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location**: Lines 1181-1198 (replace entire function)  \n**Action**: Replace  \n**Before Code**: [existing require_decoding function]  \n**After Code**:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature (FeatureType): the feature type to be checked\n        ignore_decode_attribute (:obj:`bool`, default ``False``): Whether to ignore the current value\n            of the `decode` attribute of the decodable feature types.\n    Returns:\n        :obj:`bool`\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check cache first\n    cache_key = _make_require_decoding_cache_key(feature, ignore_decode_attribute)\n    if cache_key in _require_decoding_cache:\n        return _require_decoding_cache[cache_key]\n    \n    # Original logic with result caching\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        result = any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        result = require_decoding(feature[0])\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        result = require_decoding(feature.feature)\n    else:\n        result = hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n    \n    # Store in cache\n    _require_decoding_cache[cache_key] = result\n    return result\n```  \n**Critical Details**: Preserve exact original logic, add cache check and storage, maintain same function signature\n\n### Step 4: Add cache management function\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location**: Line ~1210 (after require_decoding function)  \n**Action**: Add  \n**Before Code**: [none - new addition]  \n**After Code**:\n```python\ndef clear_require_decoding_cache():\n    \"\"\"Clear the require_decoding cache. Useful for testing or long-running applications.\"\"\"\n    global _require_decoding_cache\n    _require_decoding_cache.clear()\n```  \n**Critical Details**: Provide way to clear cache if needed, useful for testing\n\n### Step 5: Add cache info function\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`  \n**Location**: Line ~1215 (after cache clear function)  \n**Action**: Add  \n**Before Code**: [none - new addition]  \n**After Code**:\n```python\ndef get_require_decoding_cache_info():\n    \"\"\"Get information about the require_decoding cache.\"\"\"\n    return {\n        'size': len(_require_decoding_cache),\n        'keys': list(_require_decoding_cache.keys())\n    }\n```  \n**Critical Details**: Provide introspection capability for debugging and monitoring\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES WITH OTHER AGENT\n- **Other Agent's Scope**: Modifies `update` method (lines 1248-1256) for extended functionality\n- **My Scope**: Modifies `require_decoding` function (lines 1181-1198) with caching\n- **No Line Conflicts**: Our changes are well-separated (~50 lines apart)\n- **Independent Changes**: Our implementations don't interact directly\n- **Decorator Compatibility**: Both ensure compatibility with existing decorator patterns\n\n## VALIDATION PLAN\n1. **Function Signature**: Ensure `require_decoding(feature, ignore_decode_attribute=False)` remains identical\n2. **Behavior Preservation**: All existing logic paths return same results\n3. **Cache Functionality**: Verify cache hits improve performance\n4. **Recursive Handling**: Ensure nested features cache correctly\n5. **Memory Management**: Monitor cache size for potential issues\n6. **Integration**: Test with `Features` class methods that call `require_decoding`\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The bash command to execute.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The goal is to extend the method to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates while maintaining compatibility with any existing decorator patterns.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS: Architecture, Critical Notes\n- **Target File**: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n- **Current Method**: Located at lines 1248-1256, takes iterable and kwargs\n- **Extension Requirements**: Support JSON data, batch updates, maintain decorator compatibility\n- **Critical**: Preserve existing functionality while adding new capabilities\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Examine Current `update` Method Structure\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Lines 1248-1256 (current method)\nAction: Read and analyze existing implementation\nCritical Details: Understand current parameter handling and iteration pattern\n\n### Step 2: Design Extended Method Signature\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nLocation: Replace existing method (lines 1248-1256)\nAction: Replace entire method\nBefore Code: Current `update` method (8 lines)\nAfter Code: Extended `update` method with type detection and batch support\nCritical Details: Maintain method name, ensure backward compatibility\n\n### Step 3: Add Type Detection Logic\nLocation: Within the new `update` method\nAction: Add logic to detect input types (dict, JSON-like, iterable)\nCritical Details: Handle various input formats gracefully\n\n### Step 4: Implement Batch Update Support\nLocation: Within the new `update` method\nAction: Add logic to handle multiple feature updates efficiently\nCritical Details: Use existing `__setitem__` method for each update\n\n### Step 5: Add JSON Support\nLocation: Within the new `update` method\nAction: Add JSON parsing and validation\nCritical Details: Ensure JSON data is properly converted to feature updates\n\n### Step 6: Test Backward Compatibility\nAction: Verify existing usage patterns still work\nCritical Details: Ensure no breaking changes to current API\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nThe extended method will:\n1. Detect input type (dict, JSON string, iterable of tuples, etc.)\n2. Normalize input to a format suitable for batch processing\n3. Apply updates efficiently using the existing `__setitem__` mechanism\n4. Maintain all existing functionality and parameter handling\n5. Support new JSON and batch capabilities seamlessly\n\n## COORDINATION COMPLETE\n- File ownership: Other agent owns lines 1181-1198 (`require_decoding`)\n- My scope: Lines 1248-1256 (`update` method) - complete ownership\n- No shared modifications or overlapping concerns\n- Both features can be implemented independently without conflicts\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

Here's a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## Changes Made to `src/datasets/features/features.py`:\n\n### 1. Module-level cache dictionary (line 1182)\n- Added `_require_decoding_cache = {}` for storing cached results\n\n### 2. Cache key generation function (lines 1185-1206)  \n- Added `_make_require_decoding_cache_key()` function\n- Handles dict, list/tuple, object, and basic types\n- Creates consistent cache keys for different feature combinations\n\n### 3. Enhanced require_decoding function (lines 1209-1236)\n- Added cache lookup at function entry\n- Added result caching after calculation\n- Preserves exact original logic and behavior\n- Maintains identical function signature\n\n### 4. Cache management functions (lines 1239-1250)\n- `clear_require_decoding_cache()` for testing/long-running apps\n- `get_require_decoding_cache_info()` for debugging/monitoring\n\n## Key Implementation Details:\n- **Performance**: Cache reduces redundant calculations for repeated checks\n- **Compatibility**: No changes to function signature or external behavior  \n- **Memory**: Module-level cache persists for session duration\n- **Safety**: Proper handling of different feature types for cache keys\n- **Integration**: Fully compatible with existing decorators and class methods\n\n## Line Ranges Used:\n- Cache dictionary: line 1182\n- Cache key function: lines 1185-1206  \n- Enhanced require_decoding: lines 1209-1236\n- Cache management: lines 1239-1250\n\nYour work on the `update` method (lines 1248-1256) should have clear separation with ~50 lines between our implementations.

Change the version in:\n    21\t   - __init__.py\n    22\t   - setup.py\n    23\t\n    24\t2. Commit these changes: \"git commit -m 'Release: VERSION'\"\n    25\t\n    26\t3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: \"git tag VERSION -m 'Add tag VERSION for pypi'\"\n    27\t   Push the tag to remote: git push --tags origin master\n    28\t\n    29\t4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n    30\t   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n    31\t\n    32\t   First, delete any \"build\" directory that may exist from previous builds.\n    33\t\n    34\t   For the wheel, run: \"python setup.py bdist_wheel\" in the top level directory.\n    35\t   (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).\n    36\t\n    37\t   For the sources, run: \"python setup.py sdist\"\n    38\t   You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n    39\t\n    40\t5.
