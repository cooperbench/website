Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

If `False`,\n            returns the underlying dictionary in the format `{\"path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            Whether to center-crop the image to a square aspect ratio during decoding.\n            Uses the shorter side as the reference for the crop size.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add center-cropping logic to decode_example method\n**File:** `src/datasets/features/image.py`  \n**Location:** Line 189 (after image loading, before mode conversion)  \n**Action:** Add cropping logic  \n**Before Code:**\n```python\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\n**After Code:**\n```python\n        else:\n            image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(bytes_))\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        \n        # Apply center-cropping if enabled\n        if self.crop_to_square:\n            width, height = image.size\n            if width != height:\n                # Use the smaller dimension as the crop size\n                crop_size = min(width, height)\n                # Calculate center coordinates\n                left = (width - crop_size) // 2\n                top = (height - crop_size) // 2\n                right = left + crop_size\n                bottom = top + crop_size\n                # Crop the image to square\n                image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n        \n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\n\n## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES\n- **PIL import:** PIL.Image is already imported within the method (line 156), so no additional import needed\n- **Cropping logic:** Uses PIL.Image.crop() with center coordinates calculated from image dimensions\n- **Backward compatibility:** Default value `False` ensures existing behavior is preserved\n- **Timing:** Cropping happens after loading but before mode conversion, as agreed\n- **Dimension check:** Only crops if width != height, avoiding unnecessary operations\n- **Center calculation:** Uses integer division for precise centering, handles odd dimensions correctly\n\n## TESTING CONSIDERATIONS\n- Test with rectangular images (non-square) to verify cropping works\n- Test with already square images to ensure no unnecessary operations  \n- Test interaction with mode conversion to ensure proper processing order\n- Test backward compatibility when `crop_to_square=False` (default behavior)\n\nThis implementation provides a clean, opt-in center-cropping feature that integrates seamlessly with the existing image processing pipeline.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Prerequisites:\n    14\t   - Dependencies:\n    15\t     - twine: `pip install twine`\n    16\t   - Create an account in (and join the 'datasets' project):\n    17\t     - PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n    18\t     - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/\n    19\t   - Don't break `transformers`: run the `transformers` CI using the `main` branch and make sure it's green.\n    20\t     - In `transformers`, use `datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets`\n    21\t       Add a step to install `datasets@main` after `save_cache` in .circleci/create_circleci_config.py:\n    22\t       ```\n    23\t       steps.append({\"run\": {\"name\": \"Install `datasets@main`\", \"command\": 'pip uninstall datasets -y && pip install \"datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets\"'}})\n    24\t       ```\n    25\t     - and then run the CI\n    26\t\n    27\t1. Create the release branch from main branch:\n    28\t     ```\n    29\t     git checkout main\n    30\t     git pull upstream main\n    31\t     git checkout -b release-VERSION\n    32\t     ```\n    33\t\n    34\t2. Change the version to the release VERSION in:\n    35\t   - __init__.py\n    36\t   - setup.py\n    37\t\n    38\t3. Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n    39\t     ```\n    40\t     git add -u\n    41\t     git commit -m \"Release: VERSION\"\n    42\t     git push upstream release-VERSION\n    43\t     ```\n    44\t   - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/release-VERSION\n    45\t   - Create pull request\n    46\t\n    47\t4. From your local release branch, build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n    48\t   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n    49\t   - First, delete any building directories that may exist from previous builds:\n    50\t     - build\n    51\t     - dist\n    52\t   - From the top level directory, build the wheel and the sources:\n    53\t       ```\n    54\t       python setup.py bdist_wheel\n    55\t       python setup.py sdist\n    56\t       ```\n    57\t   - You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n    58\t\n    59\t5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the test PyPI server:\n    60\t     ```\n    61\t     twine upload dist/* -r testpypi\n    62\t     ```\n    63\t   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:\n    64\t     ```\n    65\t     pip install huggingface-hub fsspec aiohttp pyarrow-hotfix\n    66\t     pip install -U tqdm\n    67\t     pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets\n    68\t     ```\n    69\t\n    70\t6.

Make the release on GitHub once everything is looking hunky-dory:\n    76\t   - Merge the release Pull Request\n    77\t   - Create a new release: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/releases/new\n    78\t   - Choose a tag: Introduce the new VERSION as tag, that will be created when you publish the release\n    79\t     - Create new tag VERSION on publish\n    80\t   - Release title: Introduce the new VERSION as well\n    81\t   - Describe the release\n    82\t     - Use \"Generate release notes\" button for automatic generation\n    83\t   - Publish release\n    84\t\n    85\t8. Set the dev version\n    86\t   - Create the dev-version branch from the main branch:\n    87\t       ```\n    88\t       git checkout main\n    89\t       git pull upstream main\n    90\t       git branch -D dev-version\n    91\t       git checkout -b dev-version\n    92\t       ```\n    93\t   - Change the version to X.X.X+1.dev0 (e.g. VERSION=1.18.3 -> 1.18.4.dev0) in:\n    94\t     -
