Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference).

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1.

Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

If specified, images larger than this\n        value will be downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining\n        aspect ratio. Only applied during decoding.\n```\n\n**Critical Details**: \n- Add after the `decode` parameter documentation\n- Clearly explain the behavior (proportional downscaling, maintains aspect ratio)\n- Note that it's only applied during decoding\n\n### Step 3: Implement max_resolution clamping logic in decode_example method\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n**Location**: Lines 188-191 (after mode conversion, before return statement)\n**Action**: Add image size clamping logic\n\n**Before Code**:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        return image\n```\n\n**After Code**:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n        \n        # Apply max resolution clamping if specified\n        if self.max_resolution is not None:\n            width, height = image.size\n            if width > self.max_resolution or height > self.max_resolution:\n                # Use thumbnail() to maintain aspect ratio while downscaling\n                image.thumbnail((self.max_resolution, self.max_resolution), PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)\n        \n        return image\n```\n\n**Critical Details**: \n- Add after mode conversion but before return\n- Check if either dimension exceeds max_resolution threshold\n- Use PIL.Image.thumbnail() with LANCZOS resampling for quality\n- thumbnail() modifies image in-place and maintains aspect ratio\n- Import PIL.Image.Resampling for the resampling method\n\n### Step 4: Update imports for PIL.Image.Resampling\n**File**: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n**Location**: Lines 155-158 (PIL import section in decode_example method)\n**Action**: Ensure PIL.Image.Resampling is available\n\n**Before Code**:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\n\n**After Code**:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\n\n**Critical Details**: \n- PIL.Image.Resampling is already available in the PIL.Image namespace\n- No import changes needed - PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS works directly\n- The existing import structure is sufficient\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION\n- Parameter added to constructor with proper type hint and default value\n- Docstring updated with clear parameter description  \n- Logic implemented using PIL.Image.thumbnail() for quality downscaling\n- Maintains aspect ratio and only downsizes when necessary\n- Processing order respects coordination agreement (after center-cropping)\n\n## EDGE CASE HANDLING\n- max_resolution=None (default): No clamping applied\n- Very small max_resolution: thumbnail() handles gracefully\n- Already small images: No unnecessary processing\n- Memory efficiency: Uses in-place thumbnail() modification\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Prerequisites:\n    14\t   - Dependencies:\n    15\t     - twine: `pip install twine`\n    16\t   - Create an account in (and join the 'datasets' project):\n    17\t     - PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n    18\t     - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/\n    19\t   - Don't break `transformers`: run the `transformers` CI using the `main` branch and make sure it's green.\n    20\t     - In `transformers`, use `datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets`\n    21\t       Add a step to install `datasets@main` after `save_cache` in .circleci/create_circleci_config.py:\n    22\t       ```\n    23\t       steps.append({\"run\": {\"name\": \"Install `datasets@main`\", \"command\": 'pip uninstall datasets -y && pip install \"datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets\"'}})\n    24\t       ```\n    25\t     - and then run the CI\n    26\t\n    27\t1. Create the release branch from main branch:\n    28\t     ```\n    29\t     git checkout main\n    30\t     git pull upstream main\n    31\t     git checkout -b release-VERSION\n    32\t     ```\n    33\t\n    34\t2. Change the version to the release VERSION in:\n    35\t   - __init__.py\n    36\t   - setup.py\n    37\t\n    38\t3. Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n    39\t     ```\n    40\t     git add -u\n    41\t     git commit -m \"Release: VERSION\"\n    42\t     git push upstream release-VERSION\n    43\t     ```\n    44\t   - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/release-VERSION\n    45\t   - Create pull request\n    46\t\n    47\t4. From your local release branch, build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n    48\t   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n    49\t   - First, delete any building directories that may exist from previous builds:\n    50\t     - build\n    51\t     - dist\n    52\t   - From the top level directory, build the wheel and the sources:\n    53\t       ```\n    54\t       python setup.py bdist_wheel\n    55\t       python setup.py sdist\n    56\t       ```\n    57\t   - You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n    58\t\n    59\t5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the test PyPI server:\n    60\t     ```\n    61\t     twine upload dist/* -r testpypi\n    62\t     ```\n    63\t   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:\n    64\t     ```\n    65\t     pip install huggingface-hub fsspec aiohttp pyarrow-hotfix\n    66\t     pip install -U tqdm\n    67\t     pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets\n    68\t     ```\n    69\t\n    70\t6.
