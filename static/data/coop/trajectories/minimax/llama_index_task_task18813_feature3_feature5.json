Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged for backward compatibility.\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n\n**File Ownership**: \n- **Shared File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n- **Coordination**: Other agent modifies existing `resolve_audio()` method (lines 173-187) to add callback parameter\n- **My Changes**: Add 3 new methods in specific empty line locations to avoid conflicts\n\n**Conflict Prevention**: \n- Other agent: Modifies `resolve_audio()` signature at line 173, adds callback logic within lines 173-187\n- I place my new methods in empty lines after existing method groups (lines 128, 188, 225)\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Architecture**:\n- Each new method calls the corresponding existing `resolve_*()` method\n- Calculates byte size using `len(buffer.getvalue())`\n- Returns `(BytesIO, int)` tuple for buffer and size\n- `resolve_audio_with_size()` includes optional `on_resolve` callback for API consistency with other agent's changes\n\n**Import Requirements**:\n- `from typing import Tuple`\n- `from io import BytesIO` (likely already imported)\n- `from typing import Callable` (likely needed for callback parameter)\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add resolve_image_with_size() method\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: After line 126 (before empty line 128)\n**Action**: Add new method\n**Before Code**: \n```python\n        return buffer\n\n[empty line 128]\n```\n**After Code**:\n```python\n        return buffer\n\n    def resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> Tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"Resolve image data and return both buffer and byte count.\n        \n        Args:\n            as_base64: Whether to return data as base64 encoded\n            \n        Returns:\n            Tuple of (BytesIO buffer, byte count)\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = self.resolve_image(as_base64=as_base64)\n        byte_count = len(buffer.getvalue())\n        return buffer, byte_count\n\n[empty line 128]\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add resolve_audio_with_size() method  \n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: After line 186 (before empty line 188)\n**Action**: Add new method\n**Before Code**:\n```python\n        return buffer\n\n[empty line 188]\n```\n**After Code**:\n```python\n        return buffer\n\n    def resolve_audio_with_size(\n        self, \n        as_base64: bool = False, \n        on_resolve: Callable[[int], None] = None\n    ) -> Tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"Resolve audio data and return both buffer and byte count.\n        \n        Args:\n            as_base64: Whether to return data as base64 encoded\n            on_resolve: Optional callback receiving byte count for progress tracking\n            \n        Returns:\n            Tuple of (BytesIO buffer, byte count)\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = self.resolve_audio(as_base64=as_base64, on_resolve=on_resolve)\n        byte_count = len(buffer.getvalue())\n        return buffer, byte_count\n\n[empty line 188]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add resolve_document_with_size() method\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: After line 223 (before empty line 225)\n**Action**: Add new method\n**Before Code**:\n```python\n        return buffer\n\n[empty line 225]\n```\n**After Code**:\n```python\n        return buffer\n\n    def resolve_document_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> Tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n        \"\"\"Resolve document data and return both buffer and byte count.\n        \n        Args:\n            as_base64: Whether to return data as base64 encoded\n            \n        Returns:\n            Tuple of (BytesIO buffer, byte count)\n        \"\"\"\n        buffer = self.resolve_document(as_base64=as_base64)\n        byte_count = len(buffer.getvalue())\n        return buffer, byte_count\n\n[empty line 225]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify imports and type annotations\n**File**: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n**Location**: Top of file imports section\n**Action**: Verify/ensure imports present\n**Required imports**:\n- `from typing import Tuple` \n- `from io import BytesIO`\n- `from typing import Callable`\n\n## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES\n\n1. **API Consistency**: `resolve_audio_with_size()` includes `on_resolve` callback parameter to match other agent's modifications to the base `resolve_audio()` method\n2. **Buffer State**: Each method calls the existing `resolve_*()` method first, then calculates size - this ensures proper buffer positioning\n3. **Backward Compatibility**: Original `resolve_*()` methods remain unchanged \n4. **Error Handling**: Delegates to existing method error handling - no additional error cases introduced\n5. **Performance**: Minimal overhead - only adds one `len()` call per resolution\n\n## VERIFICATION STEPS\n\n1. Import statements include required types\n2. All three methods compile without syntax errors  \n3. Method signatures match expected `Tuple[BytesIO, int]` return types\n4. Audio method signature includes `on_resolve` callback parameter\n5. Methods placed in correct empty line locations to avoid conflicts\n6. Docstrings follow existing code patterns\n\nThis implementation provides a clean, backward-compatible API for users who need both buffer content and size information in a single call.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "action": "system", "args": {"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\n- Other agent handles adding three new `resolve_*_with_size()` methods:\n  - `resolve_image_with_size()` after line 126 in ImageBlock class\n  - `resolve_audio_with_size()` after line 186 in AudioBlock class  \n  - `resolve_document_with_size()` after line 223 in DocumentBlock class\n- Other agent will include `on_resolve` parameter in their `resolve_audio_with_size()` method for API consistency\n- I own modifying the existing `resolve_audio()` method to add the progress callback hook\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION\n### Step 1: Add progress callback parameter to resolve_audio method\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Line 173 (method signature)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> BytesIO:\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\ndef resolve_audio(self, as_base64: bool = False, on_resolve: Callable[[int], None] = None) -> BytesIO:\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add callback invocation logic\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nLocation: Lines 181-186 (method implementation)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n```python\nreturn resolve_binary(\n    raw_bytes=self.audio,\n    path=self.path,\n    url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n    as_base64=as_base64,\n)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nbuffer = resolve_binary(\n    raw_bytes=self.audio,\n    path=self.path,\n    url=str(self.url) if self.url else None,\n    as_base64=as_base64,\n)\n\n# Invoke callback with byte count if provided\nif on_resolve is not None:\n    byte_count = len(buffer.getvalue())\n    on_resolve(byte_count)\n\nreturn buffer\n```\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n- The callback receives the final byte count of the resolved audio buffer\n- Uses `len(buffer.getvalue())` to calculate byte count after resolution\n- Fully backward compatible - parameter is optional with default `None`\n- Callback is invoked after resolution but before returning the buffer\n- Requires importing `Callable` from typing module (already imported in file)\n\n## CRITICAL NOTES\n- Ensure callback is only invoked if not None to avoid unnecessary overhead\n- Buffer must be read using `.getvalue()` to get accurate byte count\n- Method signature change is minimal and maintains existing API\n- No changes to existing behavior when callback is not provided\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.

This shouldn't conflict since I'm adding new methods in empty line locations.\n\nHowever, I need to be aware that they're adding a callback parameter to `resolve_audio()` which means my `resolve_audio_with_size()` method will need to include this callback parameter to match the API.\n\nLet me start by exploring the current file to understand the structure and then implement my changes.", "signature": "a2530aa237d6c83c794a924078bb267af6d6eb4fa9ee562be607843b91eeb670"}]}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 542, "prompt_tokens": 8533, "total_tokens": 9075, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 297, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py:\n     1\tfrom __future__ import annotations\n     2\t\n     3\timport base64\n     4\timport filetype\n     5\tfrom binascii import Error as BinasciiError\n     6\tfrom enum import Enum\n     7\tfrom io import BytesIO\n     8\tfrom pathlib import Path\n     9\tfrom typing import (\n    10\t    Annotated,\n    11\t    Any,\n    12\t    AsyncGenerator,\n    13\t    Generator,\n    14\t    List,\n    15\t    Literal,\n    16\t    Optional,\n    17\t    Union,\n    18\t    cast,\n    19\t)\n    20\t\n    21\timport filetype\n    22\tfrom typing_extensions import Self\n    23\t\n    24\tfrom llama_index.core.bridge.pydantic import (\n    25\t    AnyUrl,\n    26\t    BaseModel,\n    27\t    ConfigDict,\n    28\t    Field,\n    29\t    FilePath,\n    30\t    field_serializer,\n    31\t    field_validator,\n    32\t    model_validator,\n    33\t)\n    34\tfrom llama_index.core.constants import DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOW, DEFAULT_NUM_OUTPUTS\n    35\tfrom llama_index.core.schema import ImageDocument\n    36\tfrom llama_index.core.utils import resolve_binary\n    37\t\n    38\t\n    39\tclass MessageRole(str, Enum):\n    40\t    \"\"\"Message role.\"\"\"\n    41\t\n    42\t    SYSTEM = \"system\"\n    43\t    DEVELOPER = \"developer\"\n    44\t    USER = \"user\"\n    45\t    ASSISTANT = \"assistant\"\n    46\t    FUNCTION = \"function\"\n    47\t    TOOL = \"tool\"\n    48\t    CHATBOT = \"chatbot\"\n    49\t    MODEL = \"model\"\n    50\t\n    51\t\n    52\tclass TextBlock(BaseModel):\n    53\t    block_type: Literal[\"text\"] = \"text\"\n    54\t    text: str\n    55\t\n    56\t\n    57\tclass ImageBlock(BaseModel):\n    58\t    block_type: Literal[\"image\"] = \"image\"\n    59\t    image: bytes | None = None\n    60\t    path: FilePath | None = None\n    61\t    url: AnyUrl | str | None = None\n    62\t    image_mimetype: str | None = None\n    63\t    detail: str | None = None\n    64\t\n    65\t    @field_validator(\"url\", mode=\"after\")\n    66\t    @classmethod\n    67\t    def urlstr_to_anyurl(cls, url: str | AnyUrl | None) -> AnyUrl | None:\n    68\t        \"\"\"Store the url as Anyurl.\"\"\"\n    69\t        if isinstance(url, AnyUrl):\n    70\t            return url\n    71\t        if url is None:\n    72\t            return None\n    73\t\n    74\t        return AnyUrl(url=url)\n    75\t\n    76\t    @model_validator(mode=\"after\")\n    77\t    def image_to_base64(self) -> Self:\n    78\t        \"\"\"\n    79\t        Store the image as base64 and guess the mimetype when possible.\n    80\t\n    81\t        In case the model was built passing image data but without a mimetype,\n    82\t        we try to guess it using the filetype library.
