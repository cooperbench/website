Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "file_urls": null, "image_urls": null, "wait_for_response": false}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 2, "timestamp": "2025-12-13T04:51:30.710077", "source": "user", "message": "Retrieving content for: You are agent_4 working on the following feature i", "action": "recall", "args": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "query": "You are agent_4 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Extended `update` Method\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis PR extends the `update` method of the `Features` class to support additional types, such as JSON, and allows for batch updates. The enhanced method improves flexibility when working with diverse data types, though it may conflict with the existing decorator-enhanced update method.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `update` method in `Features` only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe method is modified to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates. Careful attention was given to ensure compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method, though there is potential for conflict.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The current `update` method in the `Features` class only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and complex workflows.\nGoal: Extend the `update` method to support additional types (like JSON) and allow for batch updates while maintaining compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method.\nRequirements: \n- Support JSON type in addition to existing types\n- Enable batch updates (accepting lists of dictionaries)\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n- Avoid conflicts with the decorator implementation\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/features.py (Shared - I handle the update method implementation, you handle the decorator)\nOther Agent Handles: Implementing the sync_features_dicts decorator\nShared File Strategy: I will implement the extended update method starting at line 1248, and you will implement the decorator above this line. We will coordinate on the method signature to ensure compatibility.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `update` method is a core method of the `Features` class that merges feature specifications. The extension will add type checking for JSON and batch processing logic.\nCritical Notes: \n- Must maintain the existing method signature and behavior for backward compatibility\n- JSON type should be handled as a special case in the type checking\n- Batch updates should process lists of dictionaries and merge them sequentially\n- Use existing type checking patterns from the file\n- Add new type check for JSON at the appropriate location\n- Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Extend the update method to handle JSON type and batch updates\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: Shared -

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Sync Features dictionaries\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis PR introduces a wrapper function for the `Features` class to keep the secondary dictionary, `_column_requires_decoding`, synchronized with the main features dictionary. The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The Features class has a secondary dictionary `_column_requires_decoding` that tracks decoding requirements for columns, but it is not automatically synchronized with the main features dictionary. This can lead to inconsistencies when dictionary operations are performed.\n\nGoal: Implement a decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` that ensures all modifications to the Features dictionary (add, update, delete) are automatically reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary, maintaining consistency between the two.\n\nRequirements:\n- The decorator must wrap standard dictionary operations: `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, `update`, `pop`, `popitem`, `clear`, and `setdefault`\n- The decorator must preserve existing functionality and performance\n- The implementation must not break existing code\n- The decorator must be applied to the Features class without subclassing UserDict to avoid performance issues\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: **Shared - I own the decorator implementation, you own the update method extension**\nOther Agent Handles: Extending the `update` method to support additional types (JSON, batch updates)\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate on line positioning in src/datasets/features/features.py. I will implement the decorator and its wrapper functions before your update method changes. I will place my code at the top of the file (after imports) and you will modify the `update` method after my implementation.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution uses a decorator pattern to wrap dictionary methods without subclassing UserDict. This avoids performance overhead and breaking changes.\nCritical Notes: \n- Must use `@keep_features_dicts_synced` decorator on the Features class\n- Must maintain exact method signatures and return types\n- Must preserve existing error handling\n- Must not modify the `__init__` method or `__new__` method\n- Must not change the class inheritance (Features is already a dict)\n- Must use `super()` calls correctly for base dictionary operations\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Define the keep_features_dicts_synced decorator\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After imports, before Features class definition (around line 150)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none -

The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The Features class has a secondary dictionary `_column_requires_decoding` that tracks decoding requirements for columns, but it is not automatically synchronized with the main features dictionary. This can lead to inconsistencies when dictionary operations are performed.\n\nGoal: Implement a decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` that ensures all modifications to the Features dictionary (add, update, delete) are automatically reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary, maintaining consistency between the two.\n\nRequirements:\n- The decorator must wrap standard dictionary operations: `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, `update`, `pop`, `popitem`, `clear`, and `setdefault`\n- The decorator must preserve existing functionality and performance\n- The implementation must not break existing code\n- The decorator must be applied to the Features class without subclassing UserDict to avoid performance issues\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: **Shared - I own the decorator implementation, you own the update method extension**\nOther Agent Handles: Extending the `update` method to support additional types (JSON, batch updates)\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate on line positioning in src/datasets/features/features.py. I will implement the decorator and its wrapper functions before your update method changes. I will place my code at the top of the file (after imports) and you will modify the `update` method after my implementation.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution uses a decorator pattern to wrap dictionary methods without subclassing UserDict.

Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id":
