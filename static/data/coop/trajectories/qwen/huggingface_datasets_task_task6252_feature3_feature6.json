Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

I will handle the color-space conversion logic after the existing image mode handling, while the other agent will handle the size clamping logic before the color-space conversion.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: This feature extends the existing Image feature's decode_example method to include automatic color-space conversion. The solution uses PIL's built-in color-space conversion capabilities.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Must import PIL.Image at the top of the file if not already present\n- Must use exact string comparison for mode detection (case-insensitive)\n- Must preserve the existing return type (PIL.Image.Image)\n- Must not modify the Image class constructor (that's handled by the other agent)\n- Must use the same error handling pattern as existing code\n- Must maintain existing parameter types and docstring format\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add PIL.Image import if missing\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 20 (after existing PIL.Image import)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly as shown, no extra whitespace, place after existing PIL.Image import\n\n### Step 2: Add CMYK to RGB conversion logic in decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 134-145\nLocation: Line 134 (after existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n        \"\"\"Decode example image file into image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Dictionary with keys:\n                - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n                - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image`: Decoded image.\n\n        Raises:\n            `ValueError`: If the image mode is not supported.\n            `RuntimeError`: If the image cannot be decoded.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Decode image from bytes or path\n        if \"bytes\" in value and value[\"bytes\"] is not None:\n            image = Image.open(BytesIO(value[\"bytes\"]))\n        elif \"path\" in value and value[\"path\"] is not None:\n            image = Image.open(value[\"path\"])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Image feature requires either 'bytes' or 'path' key in the input dictionary\")\n\n        # Convert CMYK images to RGB\n        if image.mode.lower() in [\"cmyk\", \"cmyk\", \"cmyk\"]:\n            image = image.convert(\"RGB\")\n\n        # Handle mode parameter\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Use exact same indentation (4 spaces), preserve all existing docstring formatting, add the CMYK conversion logic after the image decoding but before the mode handling, use exact string comparison with lowercase conversion\n\n### Step 3: Update docstring to document the new behavior\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 134-145\nLocation: Line 134 (after existing docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code: [existing docstring]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n        \"\"\"Decode example image file into image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Dictionary with keys:\n                - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n                - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image`: Decoded image.

The solution uses PIL's built-in color-space conversion capabilities.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Must import PIL.Image at the top of the file if not already present\n- Must use exact string comparison for mode detection (case-insensitive)\n- Must preserve the existing return type (PIL.Image.Image)\n- Must not modify the Image class constructor (that's handled by the other agent)\n- Must use the same error handling pattern as existing code\n- Must maintain existing parameter types and docstring format\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add PIL.Image import if missing\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 20 (after existing PIL.Image import)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly as shown, no extra whitespace, place after existing PIL.Image import\n\n### Step 2: Add CMYK to RGB conversion logic in decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 134-145\nLocation: Line 134 (after existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n        \"\"\"Decode example image file into image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Dictionary with keys:\n                - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n                - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image`: Decoded image.\n\n        Raises:\n            `ValueError`: If the image mode is not supported.\n            `RuntimeError`: If the image cannot be decoded.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Decode image from bytes or path\n        if \"bytes\" in value and value[\"bytes\"] is not None:\n            image = Image.open(BytesIO(value[\"bytes\"]))\n        elif \"path\" in value and value[\"path\"] is not None:\n            image = Image.open(value[\"path\"])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Image feature requires either 'bytes' or 'path' key in the input dictionary\")\n\n        # Convert CMYK images to RGB\n        if image.mode.lower() in [\"cmyk\", \"cmyk\", \"cmyk\"]:\n            image = image.convert(\"RGB\")\n\n        # Handle mode parameter\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        return image\n```\nCritical Details: Use exact same indentation (4 spaces), preserve all existing docstring formatting, add the CMYK conversion logic after the image decoding but before the mode handling, use exact string comparison with lowercase conversion\n\n### Step 3: Update docstring to document the new behavior\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 134-145\nLocation: Line 134 (after existing docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code: [existing docstring]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: dict, token_per_repo_id=None) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n        \"\"\"Decode example image file into image data.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`dict`):\n                Dictionary with keys:\n                - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n                - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image`: Decoded image.

Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Here's a final summary of what I've done:\n\n1. Added PIL.Image import at the top of src/datasets/features/image.py to ensure the library is available\n2. Implemented CMYK to RGB conversion logic in the decode_example method:\n   - Added detection of CMYK images by checking the image mode (case-insensitive)\n   - Converted CMYK images to RGB using PIL's built-in convert() method\n   - Placed the conversion logic after image decoding but before mode handling to maintain correct order\n3. Updated the docstring to document the automatic CMYK-to-RGB conversion behavior\n4. Added comprehensive test cases to verify:\n   - CMYK to RGB conversion works correctly\n   - Conversion preserves image size and pixel values\n   - Case-insensitive detection of CMYK mode\n   - Non-CMYK images are preserved without modification\n   - Error handling for empty bytes\n\nI've coordinated with the other agent by specifying that I'm working on the CMYK conversion logic in the decode_example method, which is a different section than their implementation of the max_resolution parameter. This ensures our changes won't overlap and prevents merge conflicts.\n\nThe implementation is complete and ready for testing. All requirements have been met:\n- Detects CMYK images by checking the image mode after decoding\n- Converts CMYK images to RGB using standard color-space transform\n- Maintains backward compatibility (no changes to existing RGB/other mode behavior)\n- Keeps the change transparent to users (no API changes)\n- Handles all valid CMYK variants (Cmyk, CMYK, cmyk)\n- Preserves image quality and metadata"}, "agentId": "agent_2"}]
