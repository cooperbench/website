Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected during decoding, causing incorrect orientation in downstream tasks like object detection or layout modeling. This leads to inconsistent image dimensions and spatial misalignment.\n\nGoal: Automatically correct EXIF orientation metadata during image decoding in the datasets.features.Image class, ensuring images are displayed in their correct orientation without requiring manual preprocessing.\n\nRequirements:\n- Detect EXIF orientation metadata in image files\n- Apply PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose() to correct orientation when needed\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing behavior\n- Add correction before mode conversion to preserve correct dimensions\n- Use minimal overhead and no additional dependencies\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (Shared - I handle lines 189-190, Other agent handles lines 191-192)\nOther Agent Handles: CMYK-to-RGB conversion in the same file (lines 191-192)\nShared File Strategy: EXIF correction added at line 189, CMYK conversion added at line 191, creating clear non-overlapping sections\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: Integration into the existing decode_example method of the Image class, which handles image decoding from various sources\nCritical Notes: Must import PIL.ImageOps at the top of the file (already present), add correction after image.load() but before mode conversion, use the same error handling pattern as existing code\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add EXIF orientation correction after image loading\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 189-190\nLocation: Line 189 (after image.load() and before self.mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  #

Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected during decoding, causing incorrect orientation in downstream tasks like object detection or layout modeling.

Images with orientation tags (3, 6, 8) are rotated/transformed to their correct orientation. This ensures consistent image orientation for downstream tasks like object detection or layout modeling.\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new paragraph exactly as shown, maintain existing formatting and spacing, add after the existing feature documentation, use the same rst syntax and indentation\n\n### Step 7: Update changelog for the new feature\nFile: `CHANGELOG.md`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the latest version entry\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```markdown\n## [1.20.0] - 2023-11-15\n\n### Added\n- New feature: Support for streaming data loading with `streaming=True` in `load_dataset`\n- New feature: Support for `max_samples` parameter in `load_dataset`\n```\nAfter Code:\n```markdown\n## [1.20.0] - 2023-11-15\n\n### Added\n- New feature: Support for streaming data loading with `streaming=True` in `load_dataset`\n- New feature: Support for `max_samples` parameter in `load_dataset`\n- New feature: Automatic EXIF orientation correction for images in the `Image` feature\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new feature exactly as shown, maintain existing formatting and spacing, add after the latest version entry, use the same markdown syntax and indentation\n\n### Step 8: Verify all implementation details\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 189\nAction: Verify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if present\n        if hasattr(image, \"getexif\") and image.getexif() is not None:\n            exif = image.getexif()\n            orientation = exif.get(0x0112)  # EXIF orientation tag\n            if orientation in (3, 6, 8):\n                image = image.transpose(ImageOps.exif_transpose)\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if present\n        if hasattr(image, \"getexif\") and image.getexif() is not None:\n            exif = image.getexif()\n            orientation = exif.get(0x0112)  # EXIF orientation tag\n            if orientation in (3, 6, 8):\n                image = image.transpose(ImageOps.exif_transpose)\n        if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n```\nCritical Details: Verify the code is exactly as specified, with correct indentation, spacing, and import statements, ensure the correction happens before mode conversion, verify the orientation values (3, 6, 8) are correct for common EXIF orientations\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

I handle lines 191-195\nLocation: Line 191 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `return image`\nAfter Code: (same as Step 1)\nCritical Details: \n- The implementation should not modify images that are already RGB, RGBA, or other non-CMYK modes\n- The check `if image.mode == 'CMYK'` ensures only CMYK images are converted\n- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing behavior\n- No additional imports are needed as PIL.Image is already imported in the decode_example method\n\n### Step 3: Ensure proper error handling and edge cases\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 191-195\nLocation: Line 191 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `return image`\nAfter Code: (same as Step 1)\nCritical Details: \n- The implementation handles all edge cases naturally through PIL.Image's robust error handling\n- No additional error handling is needed as PIL.Image.convert() will raise appropriate exceptions if the conversion fails\n- The implementation is safe for any valid image mode\n- The code is designed to be idempotent (calling it multiple times on the same image won't cause issues)\n\n### Step 4: Verify the implementation maintains existing functionality\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 191-195\nLocation: Line 191 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `return image`\nAfter Code: (same as Step 1)\nCritical Details: \n- The implementation preserves all existing functionality\n- Images that are not CMYK will be returned unchanged\n- Images that are CMYK will be converted to RGB\n- The mode conversion (self.mode) still works as expected\n- The return type remains PIL.Image.Image\n- The implementation doesn't affect any other features or methods\n\n### Step 5: Add documentation for the new functionality\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared -

I handle lines 191-195\nLocation: Line 191 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `return image`\nAfter Code: (same as Step 1)\nCritical Details: \n- The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase\n- No changes to other methods or classes are required\n- The implementation works with all existing image formats\n- The implementation maintains the same error handling and exception propagation\n- The implementation is consistent with the existing code style and patterns\n\n### Step 7: Test the implementation\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 191-195\nLocation: Line 191 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `return image`\nAfter Code: (same as Step 1)\nCritical Details: \n- The implementation should be tested with CMYK images to verify conversion to RGB\n- The implementation should be tested with non-CMYK images to verify no changes\n- The implementation should be tested with various image modes (RGB, RGBA, etc.)\n- The implementation should be tested with both file paths and bytes\n- The implementation should be tested with different mode conversion scenarios\n\n### Step 8: Verify no merge conflicts with other agent's implementation\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 191-195\nLocation: Line 191 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `return image`\nAfter Code: (same as Step 1)\nCritical Details: \n- The implementation is positioned at line 191, after the other agent's implementation at lines 189-190\n- There is no line overlap between the two implementations\n- The implementation is isolated to a specific section of the decode_example method\n- The other agent's implementation (EXIF correction) is at lines 189-190, mine is at line 191\n- This ensures no merge conflicts when both features are merged\n- The implementation is designed to work in parallel with the other agent's changes\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_6 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.
