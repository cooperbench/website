Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\nGoal: Add a `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class that enables automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding, ensuring all output images have equal width and height.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add a new optional `crop_to_square: bool = False` parameter to the `Image` class\n- When enabled, crop the image to a centered square using the shorter side as the reference dimension\n- Apply cropping before any mode conversion or resizing\n- Preserve backward compatibility (default behavior remains unchanged)\n- Ensure the feature works with all existing input types (path, dict, ndarray, PIL.Image)\n- Maintain proper error handling and type checking\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (Shared - both agents modify)\nOther Agent Handles: Adding `max_resolution` parameter and related logic\nShared File Strategy: Coordinate on line positioning in the `Image` class. I will add my changes after the existing `decode` parameter, and the other agent will add their changes after my new parameter. This ensures non-overlapping modifications.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `Image` class is a dataclass that defines image feature handling. The `decode_example` method handles image decoding and should be modified to include the center-cropping logic. The new parameter will be added to the class definition.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Use exact spacing and formatting as in existing code\n- Add the new parameter after the existing `decode` parameter\n- Keep all existing docstring formatting and structure\n- Use `PIL.Image.Image` methods for cropping\n- Ensure the parameter is optional with default value `False`\n- Add proper type hints\n- Do not modify any other parts of the class\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 85-86 (after existing decode parameter)\nLocation: Line 85 (after the existing `decode: bool = True` line)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one line after the `decode` parameter with the exact same formatting (indentation, spacing, and comma placement). Keep the `crop_to_square` parameter at the same level as `decode`.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 86-87 (after existing docstring)\nLocation: Line 86 (after existing `decode` parameter description)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`, returns the underlying dictionary in the format `\"{path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`, returns the underlying dictionary in the format `\"{path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            Whether to crop the image to a centered square during decoding. If `True`, the image will be cropped to a square using the shorter side as the reference dimension. This is applied before any mode conversion or resizing.\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one new parameter description block after the existing `decode` parameter description. Use the same formatting (indentation, spacing, and punctuation). Keep the `crop_to_square` parameter description at the same level as `decode`.\n\n### Step 3: Update the decode_example method to include center-cropping logic\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 100-100 (after existing method body)\nLocation: Line 100 (after existing method body)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        # Existing method body\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        # If crop_to_square is True, crop to square\n        if self.crop_to_square and isinstance(image, Image.Image):\n            width, height = image.size\n            size = min(width, height)\n            left = (width - size) // 2\n            top = (height - size) // 2\n            image = image.crop((left, top, left + size, top + size))\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly the code block shown above after the existing method body. Use the exact same indentation (4 spaces). Use the exact variable name `image` as used in the existing code. Add the condition `if self.crop_to_square and isinstance(image, Image.Image):` to ensure it only applies to PIL images. Use the exact formula for calculating the crop coordinates. Keep the same formatting and spacing as the existing code.\n\n### Step 4: Add proper imports for PIL.Image\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 1-10 (after existing imports)\nLocation: Line 10 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one line after the existing imports with the `from PIL import Image` import. Use the exact same formatting and spacing as the existing imports. This import is required for the `Image.Image` type checking and cropping operations.\n\n### Step 5: Update the docstring to include the new parameter in the examples\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 100-100 (after existing examples)\nLocation: Line 100 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=True, crop_to_square=True))\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one new example block after the existing examples. Use the exact same formatting and indentation. The new example shows how to use the `crop_to_square=True` parameter. Keep the same style and structure as the existing examples.\n\n### Step 6: Add test case for the new feature\nFile: `tests/test_features/test_image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new file]\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nfrom datasets import Image\n\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"crop_to_square\", [True, False])\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"mode\", [\"RGB\", \"L\"])\ndef test_image_crop_to_square(crop_to_square, mode):\n    # Create a test image with non-square dimensions\n    image = Image.new(mode, (100, 150))\n    # Create Image feature with crop_to_square parameter\n    feature = Image(crop_to_square=crop_to_square)\n    # Decode the image\n    decoded_image = feature.decode_example(image)\n    # Check if the image is cropped to square when crop_to_square is True\n    if crop_to_square:\n        assert decoded_image.size == (100, 100)  # Should be cropped to 100x100\n    else:\n        assert decoded_image.size == (100, 150)  # Should remain 100x150\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly the test code shown above. Use the exact same formatting and indentation. The test verifies that the crop_to_square parameter works correctly for both RGB and grayscale images. The test creates a non-square image (100x150), applies the feature with both True and False values for crop_to_square, and checks that the output dimensions are correct. Add the test at the end of the file, after any existing tests.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_2 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

Keep the same formatting and spacing as the existing code.\n\n### Step 4: Add proper imports for PIL.Image\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 1-10 (after existing imports)\nLocation: Line 10 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one line after the existing imports with the `from PIL import Image` import. Use the exact same formatting and spacing as the existing imports. This import is required for the `Image.Image` type checking and cropping operations.\n\n### Step 5: Update the docstring to include the new parameter in the examples\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 100-100 (after existing examples)\nLocation: Line 100 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=True, crop_to_square=True))\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one new example block after the existing examples. Use the exact same formatting and indentation. The new example shows how to use the `crop_to_square=True` parameter. Keep the same style and structure as the existing examples.\n\n### Step 6: Add test case for the new feature\nFile: `tests/test_features/test_image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new file]\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nfrom datasets import Image\n\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"crop_to_square\", [True, False])\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"mode\", [\"RGB\", \"L\"])\ndef test_image_crop_to_square(crop_to_square, mode):\n    # Create a test image with non-square dimensions\n    image = Image.new(mode, (100, 150))\n    # Create Image feature with crop_to_square parameter\n    feature = Image(crop_to_square=crop_to_square)\n    # Decode the image\n    decoded_image = feature.decode_example(image)\n    # Check if the image is cropped to square when crop_to_square is True\n    if crop_to_square:\n        assert decoded_image.size == (100, 100)  # Should be cropped to 100x100\n    else:\n        assert decoded_image.size == (100, 150)  # Should remain 100x150\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly the test code shown above. Use the exact same formatting and indentation. The test verifies that the crop_to_square parameter works correctly for both RGB and grayscale images. The test creates a non-square image (100x150), applies the feature with both True and False values for crop_to_square, and checks that the output dimensions are correct. Add the test at the end of the file, after any existing tests.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "file_urls": null, "image_urls": null, "wait_for_response": false}, "agentId": "agent_1"}, {"id": 2, "timestamp": "2025-12-13T04:51:19.460859", "source": "user", "message": "Retrieving content for: You are agent_2 working on the following feature i", "action": "recall", "args": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "query": "You are agent_2 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Optional Center-Cropping to Square for Decoded Images\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis feature introduces a `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class, enabling automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding. The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\nGoal: Add a `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class that enables automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding, ensuring all output images have equal width and height.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add a new optional `crop_to_square: bool = False` parameter to the `Image` class\n- When enabled, crop the image to a centered square using the shorter side as the reference dimension\n- Apply cropping before any mode conversion or resizing\n- Preserve backward compatibility (default behavior remains unchanged)\n- Ensure the feature works with all existing input types (path, dict, ndarray, PIL.Image)\n- Maintain proper error handling and type checking\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (Shared - both agents modify)\nOther Agent Handles: Adding `max_resolution` parameter and related logic\nShared File Strategy: Coordinate on line positioning in the `Image` class. I will add my changes after the existing `decode` parameter, and the other agent will add their changes after my new parameter. This ensures non-overlapping modifications.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `Image` class is a dataclass that defines image feature handling. The `decode_example` method handles image decoding and should be modified to include the center-cropping logic. The new parameter will be added to the class definition.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Use exact spacing and formatting as in existing code\n- Add the new parameter after the existing `decode` parameter\n- Keep all existing docstring formatting and structure\n- Use `PIL.Image.Image` methods for cropping\n- Ensure the parameter is optional with default value `False`\n- Add proper type hints\n- Do not modify any other parts of the class\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 85-86 (after existing decode parameter)\nLocation: Line 85 (after the existing `decode: bool = True` line)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one line after the `decode` parameter with the exact same formatting (indentation, spacing, and comma placement). Keep the `crop_to_square` parameter at the same level as `decode`.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document the new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 86-87 (after existing docstring)\nLocation: Line 86 (after existing `decode` parameter description)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`, returns the underlying dictionary in the format `\"{path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data. If `False`, returns the underlying dictionary in the format `\"{path\": image_path, \"bytes\": image_bytes}`.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            Whether to crop the image to a centered square during decoding. If `True`, the image will be cropped to a square using the shorter side as the reference dimension. This is applied before any mode conversion or resizing.\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one new parameter description block after the existing `decode` parameter description. Use the same formatting (indentation, spacing, and punctuation). Keep the `crop_to_square` parameter description at the same level as `decode`.\n\n### Step 3: Update the decode_example method to include center-cropping logic\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 100-100 (after existing method body)\nLocation: Line 100 (after existing method body)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        # Existing method body\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        # If crop_to_square is True, crop to square\n        if self.crop_to_square and isinstance(image, Image.Image):\n            width, height = image.size\n            size = min(width, height)\n            left = (width - size) // 2\n            top = (height - size) // 2\n            image = image.crop((left, top, left + size, top + size))\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly the code block shown above after the existing method body. Use the exact same indentation (4 spaces). Use the exact variable name `image` as used in the existing code. Add the condition `if self.crop_to_square and isinstance(image, Image.Image):` to ensure it only applies to PIL images. Use the exact formula for calculating the crop coordinates. Keep the same formatting and spacing as the existing code.\n\n### Step 4: Add proper imports for PIL.Image\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 1-10 (after existing imports)\nLocation: Line 10 (after existing imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyarrow as pa\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one line after the existing imports with the `from PIL import Image` import. Use the exact same formatting and spacing as the existing imports. This import is required for the `Image.Image` type checking and cropping operations.\n\n### Step 5: Update the docstring to include the new parameter in the examples\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 100-100 (after existing examples)\nLocation: Line 100 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=True, crop_to_square=True))\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly one new example block after the existing examples. Use the exact same formatting and indentation. The new example shows how to use the `crop_to_square=True` parameter. Keep the same style and structure as the existing examples.\n\n### Step 6: Add test case for the new feature\nFile: `tests/test_features/test_image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new file]\nAfter Code:\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nfrom datasets import Image\n\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"crop_to_square\", [True, False])\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"mode\", [\"RGB\", \"L\"])\ndef test_image_crop_to_square(crop_to_square, mode):\n    # Create a test image with non-square dimensions\n    image = Image.new(mode, (100, 150))\n    # Create Image feature with crop_to_square parameter\n    feature = Image(crop_to_square=crop_to_square)\n    # Decode the image\n    decoded_image = feature.decode_example(image)\n    # Check if the image is cropped to square when crop_to_square is True\n    if crop_to_square:\n        assert decoded_image.size == (100, 100)  # Should be cropped to 100x100\n    else:\n        assert decoded_image.size == (100, 150)  # Should remain 100x150\n```\nCritical Details: Add exactly the test code shown above.

Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5.

Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<COLLABORATION>\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main. You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nHigh-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding, which is inefficient.\n\nGoal: Introduce an optional `max_resolution` parameter to the `Image` feature that automatically downscales images during decoding if either dimension exceeds the specified threshold, maintaining aspect ratio.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add `max_resolution` parameter to the Image class with default value None\n- If max_resolution is provided, downscale images during decode_example if either dimension exceeds the threshold\n- Use Pillow's thumbnail() method to maintain aspect ratio\n- Preserve existing functionality when max_resolution is None\n- Ensure backward compatibility\n- Add appropriate documentation and type hints\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (shared - I handle lines 88-110, other agent handles lines 111-130)\nOther Agent Handles: Center-cropping for square images implementation\nShared File Strategy: I will add my changes after the existing `decode` parameter, and the other agent will add their changes after my new parameter. This prevents overlapping line modifications.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The feature extends the existing Image class in src/datasets/features/image.py, adding a new parameter and modifying the decode_example method to include size clamping logic.\nCritical Notes: Must maintain backward compatibility, use Pillow's thumbnail() method for proper aspect ratio preservation, and ensure proper type hints and documentation.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 87 (after decode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add type hint Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]] to support single integer (for square resolution), list, or tuple. Keep the same indentation level as other parameters.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document max_resolution parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 90 (after existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    \"\"\"Image [`Feature`] to read image data from an image file.\n\n    Input: The Image feature accepts as input:\n    - A `str`: Absolute path to the image file (i.e. random access is allowed).\n    - A `dict` with the keys:\n\n        - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n        - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n      This is useful for archived files with sequential access.\n\n    - An `np.ndarray`: NumPy array representing an image.\n    - A `PIL.Image.Image`: PIL image object.\n\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

If provided, images with either dimension exceeding the threshold will be downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio. If None, no clamping is applied.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=256))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter documentation in the Args section with proper type hints and description. Update the Examples section to show usage of max_resolution.\n\n### Step 3: Modify decode_example method to include max_resolution clamping\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 105 (after existing decode_example method)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    def decode_example(self, value: Union[str, bytes, dict, np.ndarray, \"PIL.Image.Image\"]) -> \"PIL.Image.Image\":\n        \"\"\"Decode the image example.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`str`, `np.ndarray`, `PIL.Image.Image` or `dict`):\n                Data passed as input to Image feature.\n\n        Returns:\n            `PIL.Image.Image`: The decoded image.\n        \"\"\"\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            if \"bytes\" in value and value[\"bytes\"] is not None:\n                image = PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(value[\"bytes\"]))\n            elif \"path\" in value:\n                if is_local_path(value[\"path\"]):\n                    image = PIL.Image.open(value[\"path\"])\n                else:\n                    with xopen(value[\"path\"], \"rb\") as f:\n                        image = PIL.Image.open(f)\n            else:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Expected 'bytes' or 'path' in dict, got {value}\")\n        elif isinstance(value, str):\n            image = PIL.Image.open(value)\n        elif isinstance(value, np.ndarray):\n            image = PIL.Image.fromarray(value)\n        elif isinstance(value, PIL.Image.Image):\n            image = value\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid type {type(value)} for image.

Use PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS for high-quality downsampling. Handle all three input formats for max_resolution (int, list, tuple). Ensure proper error handling for invalid max_resolution types.\n\n### Step 4: Add import for PIL.Image.Resampling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 20 (after existing PIL.Image import)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n    from PIL.Image import Resampling\n```\nCritical Details: Add the Resampling import for use in the thumbnail method. This is necessary for the LANCZOS resampling method.\n\n### Step 5: Add type hint for Resampling in imports\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 21 (after existing PIL.Image import)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    from .features import FeatureType\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    from .features import FeatureType\n    from PIL.Image import Resampling\n```\nCritical Details: Add the Resampling import to the list of imports at the top of the file. This ensures proper type hints and IDE support.\n\n### Step 6: Update docstring examples to show max_resolution usage\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 110 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=256))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\nCritical Details: Add a new example showing how to use max_resolution with a single integer value (256) to clamp to a square resolution of 256x256.\n\n### Step 7: Add example with list/tuple max_resolution\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 110 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=256))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=256))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=[384, 256]))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=384x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\nCritical Details: Add a new example showing how to use max_resolution with a list/tuple to specify different width and height limits.\n\n### Step 8: Add type hint for max_resolution in class definition\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 87 (after decode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code: \n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: The type hint is already included in Step 1. This step confirms that the type hint is properly defined and consistent with the implementation.\n\n### Step 9: Verify backward compatibility\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Verify\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type\n```\nAfter Code: \n```python\n    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type\n```\nCritical Details: No changes needed to existing functionality. The new max_resolution parameter is optional and defaults to None, so existing code will continue to work without modification.\n\n### Step 10: Add test case for max_resolution functionality\nFile: `tests/test_features/test_image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n# Test image feature\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Test image feature\n\ndef test_image_max_resolution():\n    # Test with single integer max_resolution\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=256)\n    # Create a test image with dimensions larger than 256\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 500))\n    # Decode the image\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    # Check that dimensions are clamped to 256x256\n    assert decoded_image.size == (256, 256)\n\n    # Test with list max_resolution\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=[384, 256])\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 400))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (384, 256)\n\n    # Test with tuple max_resolution\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=(384, 256))\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 400))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (384, 256)\n\n    # Test with max_resolution=None (default)\n    image_feature = Image()\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 500))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (500, 500)\n\n    # Test with max_resolution larger than image\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=1000)\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 500))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (500, 500)\n```\nCritical Details: Add a comprehensive test case that verifies all supported max_resolution formats and edge cases. The test should verify that images are properly clamped when dimensions exceed the threshold, and that no changes are made when max_resolution is None or larger than the image dimensions.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

This prevents overlapping line modifications.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The feature extends the existing Image class in src/datasets/features/image.py, adding a new parameter and modifying the decode_example method to include size clamping logic.\nCritical Notes: Must maintain backward compatibility, use Pillow's thumbnail() method for proper aspect ratio preservation, and ensure proper type hints and documentation.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 87 (after decode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add type hint Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]] to support single integer (for square resolution), list, or tuple. Keep the same indentation level as other parameters.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document max_resolution parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 90 (after existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    \"\"\"Image [`Feature`] to read image data from an image file.\n\n    Input: The Image feature accepts as input:\n    - A `str`: Absolute path to the image file (i.e. random access is allowed).\n    - A `dict` with the keys:\n\n        - `path`: String with relative path of the image file to the archive file.\n        - `bytes`: Bytes of the image file.\n\n      This is useful for archived files with sequential access.\n\n    - An `np.ndarray`: NumPy array representing an image.\n    - A `PIL.Image.Image`: PIL image object.\n\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to.

Use PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS for high-quality downsampling. Handle all three input formats for max_resolution (int, list, tuple). Ensure proper error handling for invalid max_resolution types.\n\n### Step 4: Add import for PIL.Image.Resampling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 20 (after existing PIL.Image import)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n    from PIL.Image import Resampling\n```\nCritical Details: Add the Resampling import for use in the thumbnail method.

Use PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS for high-quality downsampling. Handle all three input formats for max_resolution (int, list, tuple). Ensure proper error handling for invalid max_resolution types.\n\n### Step 4: Add import for PIL.Image.Resampling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 20 (after existing PIL.Image import)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n    from PIL.Image import Resampling\n```\nCritical Details: Add the Resampling import for use in the thumbnail method. This is necessary for the LANCZOS resampling method.\n\n### Step 5: Add type hint for Resampling in imports\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 21 (after existing PIL.Image import)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    from .features import FeatureType\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    from .features import FeatureType\n    from PIL.Image import Resampling\n```\nCritical Details: Add the Resampling import to the list of imports at the top of the file. This ensures proper type hints and IDE support.\n\n### Step 6: Update docstring examples to show max_resolution usage\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 110 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ```\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=256))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\nCritical Details: Add a new example showing how to use max_resolution with a single integer value (256) to clamp to a square resolution of 256x256.\n\n### Step 7: Add example with list/tuple max_resolution\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 110 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=256))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=256))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(max_resolution=[384, 256]))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=384x256 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    ```\nCritical Details: Add a new example showing how to use max_resolution with a list/tuple to specify different width and height limits.\n\n### Step 8: Add type hint for max_resolution in class definition\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: Line 87 (after decode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code: \n```python\n    decode: bool = True\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, List[int], Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nCritical Details: The type hint is already included in Step 1. This step confirms that the type hint is properly defined and consistent with the implementation.\n\n### Step 9: Verify backward compatibility\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Verify\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type\n```\nAfter Code: \n```python\n    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type\n```\nCritical Details: No changes needed to existing functionality. The new max_resolution parameter is optional and defaults to None, so existing code will continue to work without modification.\n\n### Step 10: Add test case for max_resolution functionality\nFile: `tests/test_features/test_image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 88-110\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n# Test image feature\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Test image feature\n\ndef test_image_max_resolution():\n    # Test with single integer max_resolution\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=256)\n    # Create a test image with dimensions larger than 256\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 500))\n    # Decode the image\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    # Check that dimensions are clamped to 256x256\n    assert decoded_image.size == (256, 256)\n\n    # Test with list max_resolution\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=[384, 256])\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 400))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (384, 256)\n\n    # Test with tuple max_resolution\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=(384, 256))\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 400))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (384, 256)\n\n    # Test with max_resolution=None (default)\n    image_feature = Image()\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 500))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (500, 500)\n\n    # Test with max_resolution larger than image\n    image_feature = Image(max_resolution=1000)\n    test_image = PIL.Image.new(\"RGB\", (500, 500))\n    decoded_image = image_feature.decode_example(test_image)\n    assert decoded_image.size == (500, 500)\n```\nCritical Details: Add a comprehensive test case that verifies all supported max_resolution formats and edge cases. The test should verify that images are properly clamped when dimensions exceed the threshold, and that no changes are made when max_resolution is None or larger than the image dimensions.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3.
