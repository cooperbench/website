Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Should not modify the `mode` parameter handling.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add EXIF orientation correction after image.load()\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 188-190\nLocation: Line 188 (after image.load() call)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if present\n        if hasattr(image, \"getexif\") and image.getexif() is not None:\n            exif = image.getexif()\n            if exif.get(274) is not None:  # 274 is the EXIF orientation tag\n                image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n```\nCritical Details: Use exact indentation (4 spaces), add the new code after the image.load() call, use the exact EXIF tag number 274, and import ImageOps at the top of the file if not already present.\n\n### Step 2: Add ImageOps import at top of file\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 1-10\nLocation: Line 10 (after other PIL imports)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if config.PIL_AVAILABLE:\n            import PIL.Image\n            from PIL import ImageOps\n        else:\n            raise ImportError(\"To support decoding images, please install 'Pillow'.\")\n```\nCritical Details: Add ImageOps import on the same line as PIL.Image import, use exact syntax with parentheses, maintain existing indentation (4 spaces), and ensure it's before the decode_example method.\n\n### Step 3: Add docstring for EXIF correction\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 188-190\nLocation: Line 188 (after image.load() call)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        image.load()  # to avoid \"Too many open files\" errors\n        # Apply EXIF orientation correction if present\n        # This handles cases where images are rotated or flipped due to EXIF metadata\n        # See: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/tutorial.html#exif-orientation\n        if hasattr(image, \"getexif\") and image.getexif() is not None:\n            exif = image.getexif()\n            if exif.get(274) is not None:  # 274 is the EXIF orientation tag\n                image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)\n```\nCritical Details: Add the docstring comment with exact text, include the reference URL, maintain exact indentation (4 spaces), and ensure it's immediately after the image.load() call.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\nGoal: Add a `crop_to_square` parameter to the `Image` feature class that enables automatic center-cropping of images to a square aspect ratio during decoding, ensuring all output images have equal width and height.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add `crop_to_square: bool = False` parameter to the `Image` class\n- When `crop_to_square=True`, crop the image to a centered square using the shorter side as the reference\n- Apply cropping before any mode conversion (RGB, RGBA, etc.)\n- Preserve backward compatibility by making the feature opt-in\n- Ensure proper error handling for edge cases (e.g., empty images)\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (Shared - I handle lines 46-47, 188-190, 215-225)\nOther Agent Handles: src/datasets/features/image.py (lines 188-190, 215-225) for EXIF orientation correction\nShared File Strategy: I will implement center-cropping after the mode conversion logic (line 190+), while the other agent implements EXIF correction before mode conversion (line 188+). This ensures no overlapping changes.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `Image` feature class in `src/datasets/features/image.py` handles image decoding. The `decode_example` method is responsible for loading and processing image data. The new `crop_to_square` parameter will be added to the class definition, and the cropping logic will be integrated into the `decode_example` method.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Use PIL.Image.Image.crop() method for center-cropping\n- Calculate crop coordinates based on the shorter dimension\n- Apply cropping before any mode conversion to ensure consistent output\n- Add proper type hints and docstring updates\n- Maintain backward compatibility by defaulting to False\n- Ensure the code follows existing style and formatting\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 47 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `mode: Optional[str] = None`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter on the same line as the mode parameter for consistency. Use the same indentation and spacing as existing parameters.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring with new parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 62 (after existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Args:\n        mode (`str`, *optional*):\n            The mode to convert the image to. If `None`, the native mode of the image is used.\n        crop_to_square (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n            Whether to center-crop the image to a square aspect ratio before mode conversion.\n            If `True`, the image will be cropped to a square using the shorter side as the reference.\n            This ensures all output images have equal width and height.\n```\nCritical Details: Maintain the same formatting style as existing docstring. Add the new parameter description in the same order as the parameters are defined.\n\n### Step 3: Add center-cropping logic after mode conversion in decode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 190 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # Center-crop to square if requested\n        if self.crop_to_square:\n            width, height = image.size\n            min_dim = min(width, height)\n            # Calculate crop coordinates for center crop\n            left = (width - min_dim) // 2\n            top = (height - min_dim) // 2\n            right = left + min_dim\n            bottom = top + min_dim\n            image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n```\nCritical Details: Add the cropping logic after the mode conversion as per our agreement. Use the same indentation (4 spaces) as the existing code. Add comments explaining the logic. Handle edge cases by ensuring min_dim is positive.\n\n### Step 4: Add error handling for empty images in cropping logic\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 190 (after mode conversion)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        if self.mode is not None:\n            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n\n        # Center-crop to square if requested\n        if self.crop_to_square:\n            width, height = image.size\n            if width == 0 or height == 0:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Cannot crop empty image with size ({width}, {height})\")\n            min_dim = min(width, height)\n            # Calculate crop coordinates for center crop\n            left = (width - min_dim) // 2\n            top = (height - min_dim) // 2\n            right = left + min_dim\n            bottom = top + min_dim\n            image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n```\nCritical Details: Add validation for empty images before attempting to crop. Raise a clear error message with the image dimensions. This prevents potential crashes from invalid image sizes.\n\n### Step 5: Add test case for crop_to_square functionality\nFile: `tests/features/test_image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    def test_decode_example_crop_to_square(self):\n        # Create a test image with non-square dimensions\n        image = Image.new(\"RGB\", (640, 480))\n        # Save to bytes\n        img_bytes = BytesIO()\n        image.save(img_bytes, format=\"JPEG\")\n        img_bytes.seek(0)\n        \n        # Test with crop_to_square=True\n        feature = Image(crop_to_square=True)\n        decoded_image = feature.decode_example({\"path\": None, \"bytes\": img_bytes.getvalue()})\n        \n        # Check that output is square\n        self.assertEqual(decoded_image.size, (480, 480))\n        \n        # Test with crop_to_square=False (default)\n        feature = Image(crop_to_square=False)\n        decoded_image = feature.decode_example({\"path\": None, \"bytes\": img_bytes.getvalue()})\n        \n        # Check that output retains original dimensions\n        self.assertEqual(decoded_image.size, (640, 480))\n```\nCritical Details: Add a test case that verifies both crop_to_square=True and crop_to_square=False behaviors. Use a non-square image (640x480) to demonstrate the cropping effect. Ensure the test covers both the default and enabled cases.\n\n### Step 6: Update feature type in Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 88 (after existing dtype definition)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    # Automatically constructed\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n```\nCritical Details: Add the pa_type definition on the same line as the dtype definition for consistency. Use the same indentation and spacing as existing code.\n\n### Step 7: Add type hints for crop_to_square parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 47 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    mode: Optional[str] = None`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Ensure the type hint is consistent with the existing code style.

The crop is applied before any mode conversion, ensuring that all output images have equal width and height. This simplifies preprocessing pipelines for vision models that require square inputs.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImage datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768). Many computer vision models\u2014especially CNN-based architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet\u2014expect square inputs. Without uniform dimensions, users must insert separate preprocessing logic outside of the `datasets` library, leading to repetitive and error-prone code.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new optional flag `crop_to_square: bool = False` is added to the `Image` class. When `decode_example()` is called and the flag is enabled, the method crops the image to a centered square (using the shorter side as the reference). The cropping operation is applied before any mode conversion or resizing. This behavior is opt-in to preserve backward compatibility.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Image datasets often contain samples with varying aspect ratios (e.g., 640x480, 1024x768).

The `decode_example` method is responsible for loading and processing image data. The new `crop_to_square` parameter will be added to the class definition, and the cropping logic will be integrated into the `decode_example` method.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Use PIL.Image.Image.crop() method for center-cropping\n- Calculate crop coordinates based on the shorter dimension\n- Apply cropping before any mode conversion to ensure consistent output\n- Add proper type hints and docstring updates\n- Maintain backward compatibility by defaulting to False\n- Ensure the code follows existing style and formatting\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_to_square parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 47 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `mode: Optional[str] = None`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter on the same line as the mode parameter for consistency.

Ensure the test covers both the default and enabled cases.\n\n### Step 6: Update feature type in Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 88 (after existing dtype definition)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    # Automatically constructed\n    pa_type: ClassVar[Any] = pa.struct({\"bytes\": pa.binary(), \"path\": pa.string()})\n```\nCritical Details: Add the pa_type definition on the same line as the dtype definition for consistency. Use the same indentation and spacing as existing code.\n\n### Step 7: Add type hints for crop_to_square parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 47 (after mode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    mode: Optional[str] = None`\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_to_square: bool = False\n```\nCritical Details: Ensure the type hint is consistent with the existing code style. Use the same indentation and spacing as other parameters.\n\n### Step 8: Add documentation for crop_to_square in examples section\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 71 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: ```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n>>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n>>> ds.features[\"image\"]\nImage(decode=True, id=None)\n>>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n>>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n{'bytes': None,\n 'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n```\nAfter Code:\n```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n>>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n>>> ds.features[\"image\"]\nImage(decode=True, id=None)\n>>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n>>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n{'bytes': None,\n 'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n>>> # Example: Center-crop images to square during decoding\n>>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(crop_to_square=True))\n>>> ds[0][\"image\"].size\n(500, 500)  # Square output regardless of original aspect ratio\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new example after the existing examples. Use the same formatting and style as the existing code blocks. Show both the default behavior and the crop_to_square=True behavior to demonstrate the feature's value.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id":
